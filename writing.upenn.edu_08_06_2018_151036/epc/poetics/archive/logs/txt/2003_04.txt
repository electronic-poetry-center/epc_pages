4). thanks for the article, Ron.  One line in this interests me: "poetry is
always political" which is a far cry from polemical?  This relates to poetry
as spoken and experiment vs. the written and enshrined stuff of the
USAcentric courses and malls.  As an experiment (psychological with a tinge
of admitted masochism) I've been sending out poems to local outlets.  They
were of course ignored by USAcentric places like the public library and the
library of the local state U campus and the big city and little city dailies
either beccause of politics, nonadherence to 'established' form, or because
they are just bad, but they have been picked up by a weekly Spanish-language
paper?

5) will a free press and tenure survive the Bush regime?

6) "Not much middle ground in this argument about patriotism"  the press'
role
is not waving the flag or a video game or branding but it is different to
say
it on state-rum television and become what is being reported.

High schools had a rigorous Russian lit program to inculcate the correct
worldview for future communist builders. Quite a number of pre-revolutionary
writers were studied starting from Lomonosov (some earlier names were just
mentioned), through Fonvizin, Derzhavin, Griboedov to major figures like
Pushkin, Lermonotov, Tolstoi, Dostoevskii, Chernyshevskii, Goncharov,
Chekhov and some more poets like Nekrasov, Tiutchev, Fet -- all of them
through the lens of a Marxist-Leninist approach.. This list is far from
complete. Of the early 20th century Silver Age only Block was studied at
length, for his "Twelve" I guess, and of course early Maiakovsky and Esenin.

Thanks for the information about the proto-feminist movement, Masha.  What

US troops accused of excess force

Steven Morris
Tuesday April 1, 2003
The Guardian

Correspondents in Iraq have come upon a number of
incidents in which the US military, especially the
marines, have appeared to act with excessive force. Here
are some examples.

The bridge at Nassiriya
After suffering heavy losses in the southern city of
Nassiriya, US marines were ordered to fire at any vehicle
which drove at American positions, Sunday Times reporter
Mark Franchetti reported. He described how one night "we
listened a dozen times as the machine guns opened fire,
cutting through cars and trucks like paper".

Next morning he said he saw 15 vehicles, including a
mini-van and two lorries, riddled with bullet holes. He
said he counted 12 dead civilians lying in the road or in
nearby ditches.

One man's body was still on fire. A girl aged no more than
five lay dead in a ditch beside the body of a man who may
have been her father. On the bridge an Iraqi civilian lay
next to the carcass of a donkey. A father, baby girl and
boy had been buried in a shallow grave. Franchetti said
the civilians had been trying to leave the town, probably
for fear of being killed by US helicopter attacks or heavy
artillery. He wrote: "Their mistake had been to flee over
a bridge that is crucial to the coalition's supply lines
and to run into a group of shell-shocked young American
marines with orders to shoot anything that moved."

Cluster bombs
A surgical assistant at the Saddam hospital in Nassiriya,
Mustafa Mohammed Ali, told the Guardian's James Meek that
US aircraft had dropped three or four cluster bombs on
civilian areas in the city, killing 10 and wounding 200.

He said he understood the US forces going straight to
Baghdad to get rid of Saddam Hussein, but added: "I don't
want forces to come into [this] city. They have an
objective, they go straight to the target. There's no room
in the hospital because of the wounded." When he saw the
bodies of two dead marines, he revealed that he cheered
silently.

Meek also told the story of a 50-year-old businessman and
farmer, Said Yagur, who said marines searched his house
and took his son, Nathen, his Kalashnikov rifle and 3m
dinars (about £500). The marines argued the money was
probably destined for terrorist activities. After protests
by the father, who rose up against Saddam Hussein after
the last Gulf War and had his house shelled by the
dictator's artillery, they let the son go and returned the
gun and money.

The road to Baghdad
Reporters have seen more than a dozen burnt-out buses and
trucks and the bodies of at least 60 Iraqi men on the road
north of Nassiriya. A photograph carried in the Guardian
last week showed a bus which had been attacked by US
troops. Bloodstained corpses lay nearby.

Reuters journalist Sean Maguire said there were four
bodies outside the bus and - according to the marines - 16
more inside. The Americans told him the dead men wore a
mix of civilian and military clothing and were in
possession of papers "that appeared to identify them as
Republican Guard". But Brigadier General John Kelly
admitted to Maguire: "We have very little time to decide
if a truck or bus is going to be hostile." The reporter
described the bullet-ridden bus and the bodies as
"evidence of the ruthless efficiency with which lead
marine units are clearing the road north of Nassiriya to
make way for a military convoy".

Exuberance
A British officer was alarmed when the American marines
who were escorting him through the port of Umm Qasr let
loose a volley of rifle fire at a house on the outskirts
of town.

The officer told Reuters reporter David Fox: "They said
they had been sniped out from there a few days ago so they
like to give them a warning every now and then. That is
something we [the British] would never condone." A US
special forces officer said it was sometimes difficult to
contain the exuberance of men doing the actual fighting.
"You got to realise these guys are single-minded in their
training. It's look after yourself and your buddies. How
do we know who the enemy is?"

Our President, George Walker Bush, is the direct decsendant of Kings Cerdic,
Egbert, Aelthelwulf, Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder, William the
Conqueror, Henry I,  Robert I Bruce, and Robert II Stuart, and the son of
George Herbert Walker Bush.  He is the direct descendant of two distinct
monarchies of England, that of Egbert and of William the Conqueror.

********************************

The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth; for kings are not
only  God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by
God himself  are called gods. There be three principal similitudes that
illustrate the state  of monarchy: one taken out of the word of God; and the
two other out of the  grounds of policy and philosophy. In the Scriptures
kings are called gods, and  so their power after a certain relation compared
to the divine power. Kings are  also compared to fathers of families: for a
king is truly Parens patriae, the  politique father of his people. And
lastly, kings are compared to the head of  this microcosm of the body of
man.

Kings are justly called gods, for that they exercise a manner or resemblance
of  divine power upon earth: for if you will consider the attributes to God,
you  shall see how they agree in the person of a king. God hath power to
create or  destrov make or unmake at his pleasure, to give life or send
death, to judge all  and to be judged nor accountable to none; to raise low
things and to make high  things low at his pleasure, and to God are both
souls and body due. And the like  power have kings: they make and unmake
their subjects, thev have power of  raising and casting down, of life and of
death, judges over all their subjects  and in all causes and yet accountable
to none but God only. . . .

I conclude then this point touching the power of kings with this axiom of
divinity, That as to dispute what God may do is blasphemy....so is it
sedition  in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his
power. But just  kings will ever be willing to declare what they will do, if
they will not incur  the curse of God. I will not be content that my power
be disputed upon; but I  shall ever be willing to make the reason appear of
all my doings, and rule my  actions according to my laws. . . I would wish
you to be careful to avoid three  things in the matter of grievances:

First, that you do not meddle with the main points of government; that is my
craft . . . to meddle with that were to lesson me . . . I must not be taught
my  office.

Secondly, I would not have you meddle with such ancient rights of mine as I
have  received from my predecessors . . . . All novelties are dangerous as
well in a  politic as in a natural body. and therefore I would be loath to
be quarreled in  my ancient rights and possessions, for that were to judge
me unworthy of that  which my predecessors had and left me.

And lastly, I pray you beware to exhibit for grievance anything that is
established by a settled law, and whereunto . . . you know I will never give
a  plausible answer; for it is an undutiful part in subjects to press their
king,  wherein they know beforehand he will refuse them.

From King James I, Works, (1609).

***************************************

William the Conqueror is the son of Robert I "the Devil," Duke of Normandy.

***************************************

King Edward the Confessor is the great-great-great grandson of King Alfred
the Great.

King Harold II is the son of King Edward the Confessor.

King William I the Conqueror killed King Harold II and took his throne.

George Walker Bush is the direct descendant of two families who tried to
kill one another for the throne of England.


***************************************

Emperor Charlemagne, great^42 uncle of George Walker Bush, is son of Pepin
III, King of the Franks, and part of the House of Pepin.  Three of
Charlemagne's sons became Kings, of Neustria, Aquitaine, and Italy.  His
Grandchildren include another King of Italy, King of Germany, King of
Aquitaine, King of Neustria, and Emperors Lothair I & Charles the Bald (also
King of Aquitaine).  Charlemagne's direct descendants include Emperors
Guido, Lambert, Louis II, Louis II, and the French kings Charles II the Fat
of France, Charles III the Simple, Louis II, III, IV, V, Lothair, and King
Arnulf of Germany.  Arnulf's direct descendants (the Welf and Hohenstaufen
families) include at least two popes and Emperors Henry IV, V, VI, Conrad
III & IV, Frederick I and II, Philip, and Otto IV.  From Philip is descended
the House of Castile, which includes Ferdinand II, King of Aragon and
sponsor of Christopher Columbus.  Ferdinand's two grandchildren, Emperors
Charles I (later Emperor Charles V), and Ferdinand I, are the children of
Philip of Hapsburg and serve as the patriarchs of the Spanish and Austrian
Hapsburg families, respectively.

Hapsburg literally means, "Hawk's Castle."

***************************************

George Washington, like George Bush, is a direct descendant of King Egbert
who married into the Charlemagne dynasty.  He is descended through two
family lineages that managed to come together after 1000 years.  This makes
them distant cousins.  Interestingly enough, Washington is ALSO directly
descended from William the Conqueror.  In fact, the Charlemagne family is
interlaced with the pre-Norman Invasion English Kings (re: inbred).
Franklin Delano Roosevelt is directly descended from the Charlemagne
dynasty, from Egbert and from William.  Roosevelt is also a direct
descendant of the Polish King Mieszko I, Danish King Svend I, and English
King Merfyn.  Interestingly enough, Roosevelt father AND mother are both
direct descendants of William the Conqueror.  James Monroe is the great^12
grandson of King James I Stuart.  And so on and on....

>On Getting Along
>By Howard Zinn



>You ask how I manage to stay involved and remain seemingly happy and
>adjusted to this awful world where the efforts of caring people pale
>in  comparison to those who have power?
>
>It's easy. First, don't let "those who have power" intimidate you.
>No  matter how much power they have they cannot prevent you from
>living your life, speaking your mind, thinking independently, having
>relationships with  people as you like. (Read Emma Goldman's
>autobiography "Living My Life".  Harassed, even imprisoned by
>authority, she insisted on living her life,  speaking out, however
>she felt like.)
>
>Second, find people to be with who have your values, your
>commitments, but  who also have a sense of humor. That combination
>is a necessity!
>
>Third (notice how precise is my advice that I can confidently number
>it,  the way scientist number things), understand that the major
>media will not tell you of all the acts of resistance taking place
>every day in the society, the strikes, the protests, the individual
>acts of courage in the face of authority. Look around (and you will
>certainly find it) for the evidence of these unreported acts. And
>for the little you find, extrapolate from that and assume there must
>be a thousand times as much as what you've found.
>
>Fourth: Note that throughout history people have felt powerless
>before authority, but that at certain times these powerless people,
>by organizing, acting, risking, persisting, have created enough
>power to change the world around them, even if a little. That is the
>history of the labor movement, of the women's movement, of the
>anti-Vietnam war movement, the disable persons' movement, the gay
>and lesbian movement, the movement of Black people in the South.
>
>Fifth: Remember, that those who have power, and who seem
>invulnerable are in fact quite vulnerable, that their power depends
>on the obedience of others, and when those others begin withholding
>that obedience, begin defying authority, that power at the top turns
>out to be very fragile. Generals become powerless when their
>soldiers refuse to fight, industrialists become powerless when their
>workers leave their jobs or occupy the factories.
>
>Sixth: When we forget the fragility of that power in the top we
>become astounded when it crumbles in the face of rebellion. We have
>had many such surprises in our time, both in the United States and
>in other countries.
>
>Seventh: Don't look for a moment of total triumph. See it as an
>ongoing struggle, with victories and defeats, but in the long run
>the consciousness of people growing. So you need patience,
>persistence, and need to understand that even when you don't "win,"
>there is fun and fulfillment in the fact that you have been
>involved, with other good people, in something worthwhile.
>
>Okay, seven pieces of profound advice should be enough.

Seeing the computer as an anthropomorphic entity is nothing new. Hackers have been known to pat their machines affectionately on the case, calling them by familiar names. "Ole Martha's struggling with some low-RAM issues," they say. I myself have an affectionate name for my machine: I call her Katherine, which is my girlfriend's middle name...

At the Roadblock

Vastly abandoned, the eskers and terminal
moraines of southern Finland made for diverse
and enjoyable reading. Edmund, by comparison, is
a bore, and, sadly, only one of many there.

Almost seamlessly, snow cleared by ploughing,
they wind across the glaciated countryside, tunneling,
sometimes, under the ice, becoming more or less
filled with wash when the ice melts.

Positively slashing, among the occasionally puzzled
relics of doorsteps and yardworks, setting aside
completely, push having come to shove, their pre-
conceptions of the shifting nature surrounding them.

Ultimately redoubtable, the double-minded farmer
gives rise to fear, even to dread, and is thus to be
respected, at least for the moment, beyond his
(or her) ability to do us severe and actual damage.

Subject:      bomb and grammar
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

INTRODUCTION

What is a Noun?

A noun is a person, a place, a thing, or an idea.

Let's talk about the way words are formed in Tagalog. This will help you
to understand Tagalog nouns.

There are a lot of root words in Tagalog. A root word is simply a basic,
core word that can be used to make other words, like an atom, or a
building block that is used to make a tower. In Tagalog, most root words
function as nouns. It is like the default position: if there are not any
extra parts (suffixes, or prefixes etc.)  added to the word,  then the
word is a root and it probably functions as a noun.

Let's look at an example from English to help make this clear. Root words
in English are words like beauty, bomb, kick etc.

Take the root word bomb.   On its own,  the word bomb can function as a
noun as can be seen in the following sentence:

Give me the bomb.

(The bomb is a thing I want someone to give to me. Remember the definition
of a noun is a person, place or thing.)

Now with this basic root word that functions as a noun, I can further add
things to this noun to make it a verb:

We bombed them yesterday.

This is basically the same way how Tagalog builds up different words. Root
words in Tagalog are words like ganda (beauty), ilong (nose), and awit
(song). If I take a root word like ganda, and put on a certain addition to
this word (in this case ma-) I can make ganda into an adjective.

ganda (beauty)

ganda + ma =  maganda (beautiful)

All of the long, complicated looking words that we will encounter in
Tagalog will have a core, root word embedded in there somewhere. In
reading or listening to Tagalog, it is helpful to be able to recognize
which part is the root word so you can tell what the basic meaning of the
word is. Then by looking at the special markers that have been added to
this root word, you can find out just exactly how this root word is being
used. That is the basic theme to understanding Tagalog vocabulary and how
Tagalog builds words. We will return to this theme again and again.

This is the really important beginning point to understand. The following
sections below contain more detailed information about nouns and roots.

----- Original Message -----


Before this Administration came along, it was hard to imagine that
something as intensely personal and private as a man's prayer before
going into battle could be appropriated in a business-like fashion.
Now, according to "A Christian's Duty in Time of War" -- a pamphlet
given out to thousands of Marines in Iraq -- our soldiers in the war
zone are supposed to fill out a form pledging to pray every day for
George Bush. The pamphlet has a tear-out section which the soldier is
to sign and mail to the president: "I have committed to pray for you,
your family, your staff ..." The pamphlets were created by In Touch
Ministries, an evangelical group that says "We may not all be in the
military, but we are all engaged in warfare ... spiritual warfare."

Today's prayer: "Pray that the President and his advisers will be
strong and courageous to do what is right regardless of critics."
(Translation: Pray that, even if all agree this war is a horrific
catastrophe, even if Congress leaps to its feet in anger and despair,
even if millions of Americans pour into the streets begging to bring
you home -- even then, pray that the president will wave aside his
critics and order you forward.) Wednesday's: "Pray that the President
and his advisers will be safe, healthy, well-rested and free from
fear." (Well-rested?) Friday's prayer cuts to the chase: "Pray that the
President and his advisers will recognize their divine appointment ..."
It includes some helpfully illuminating scripture, Romans 13:1: "Every
person is to be in subjugation to the governing authorities. For there
is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established
by God."

Sounds like what Virilio calls "pure war."  All soldiers of Christ?

Meanwhile the current administration's sense of divine entitlement echoes
the Crusades (a correspondence already much discussed here) as well as
Winthrop's "citty opon a hill."

God help us.

Before this Administration came along, it was hard to imagine that
something as intensely personal and private as a man's prayer before
going into battle could be appropriated in a business-like fashion.
Now, according to "A Christian's Duty in Time of War" -- a pamphlet
given out to thousands of Marines in Iraq -- our soldiers in the war
zone are supposed to fill out a form pledging to pray every day for
George Bush. The pamphlet has a tear-out section which the soldier is
to sign and mail to the president: "I have committed to pray for you,
your family, your staff ..."

Today's prayer: "Pray that the President and his advisers will be
strong and courageous to do what is right regardless of critics."
(Translation: Pray that, even if all agree this war is a horrific
catastrophe, even if Congress leaps to its feet in anger and despair,
even if millions of Americans pour into the streets begging to bring
you home -- even then, pray that the president will wave aside his
critics and order you forward.) Wednesday's: "Pray that the President
and his advisers will be safe, healthy, well-rested and free from
fear." (Well-rested?) Friday's prayer cuts to the chase: "Pray that the
President and his advisers will recognize their divine appointment ..."
It includes some helpfully illuminating scripture, Romans 13:1: "Every
person is to be in subjugation to the governing authorities. For there
is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established
by God."

Small Press Traffic presents
Saturday, April 5, 2003 at 3:30 PM
New Experiments:
Camille Martin has Poetry on the Brain
Talk and discussion begins at 3:30, reading at 5:00

Camille Martin writes: "For poets and dreamers - and brain researchers -it's a
commonplace that conscious thought is only a tiny island in a vast neural sea.
The embodied nature of thought and the inaccessibility of much of it to
consciousness has profound implications for poetry and poetics. Furthermore,
recent discussions in cognitive science about the construction of self and
narrative echo similar concerns in experimental poetry. I will discuss some of
these correspondences and propose ways in which recent developments in
cognitive science during the "decade of the brain" contribute to a richer
understanding of recent experimental poetry."


Martin is a New Orleans poet and translator. Her collections of poetry are
sesame kiosk (Potes & Poets, 2001), magnus loop (Chax Press,1999), rogue
embryo (Lavender Ink, 1999), and Plastic Heaven (Fell Swoop, 1996). She will
read from a new work, codes of public sleep. Martin founded and co-curates the
Lit City Poetry Reading Series in New Orleans and is currently completing a
dissertation on contemporary experimental poetry and its conjunction with
phenomenology and cognitive science.

I'm just catching up on a very backlogged mailbox, but no, Brian,
from what I can tell the few times I've been to any of the Fort Worth
La Madeleines in the last few weeks, they've been as crowded as usual.

Not that Fort Worth is any more or less progressive than Dallas.

FEDERAL POETRY SUBSIDIES PROPOSED

Washington, D. C. (CNS) -

In a surprise move, the Bush Administration has announced that it will
propose legislation in Congress to subsidize the production of verse by
American poets.

The program, which will be modeled on the longstanding federal agricultural
price support program, will be designed to ensure a market at a basic price
support level for the nation's poetry output.

According to administration spokeswoman April Narr, a goal of the subsidies
will be to ensure the continuing production of particular types of verse for
which the market is currently weak.  "For instance," she said at a news
conference this morning, "not too many people write sonnets or heroic
couplets any more, so those types of verse would be eligible for special
price supports."

Narr also said in response to questions that although the details have yet
to be worked out, subject matter may also be taken into account to determine
the price support levels of different types of poems.  "There are plenty
poems being written about having an affair or traveling in Europe or
watching your child grow up," she said, "so that sort of poetry probably
needs less subsidy.  But poems about junk yards or shaving cream or peeling
an orange are more rare and may be deserving of more price support."

When questioned as to whether the public will accept a government program
which channels taxpayers' dollars to poets, Narr replied, "It's really not
such an unusual idea when you think of it.  After all, if the federal
government can pay farmers to produce soybeans, why can't it pay poets to
produce sonnets?"

"The more remote or exotic the place, the more likely
we are to have full frontal views of the dead and dying.
Thus postcolonial Africa exists in the consciousness of
the general public in the rich world - besides through its
sexy music - mainly as a succession of unforgettable pho-
tographs of large-eyed victims,....These sights carry a
double message.  they show a suffering that is outra-
geous, unjust, and should be repaired.  They confirm that
this is the sort of thing which happens in the place.  The
ubiquity of those photographs, and those horrors, cannot
help but nourish belief in the inevitability of tragedy in
the benighted or backward - that is, poor - parts of the
world." - Langer

across my screen today from Reiner Strasser from another list:
'In my sight "we want peace" is great - but not enough!
(To get the shifting from oppose to create/form/construct'

and from Ron's blog:
'Like Lyndon Johnson & Richard Nixon before him, George W. Bush has provided
just the sort of primary shared point of agreement that has been lacking for
so long. To some degree, the response to date has been predictable, although
dramatically accelerated. The real issue, it seems to me, will come after
the war, when the U.S. and the ever-faithful United Kingdom are bungling the
reconstruction of all that they have laid waste. That is the point in this
process that the left of my own generation never successfully negotiated. To
date, I do not see it being addressed, but it's too soon & I would dearly
love to be wrong in my skepticism on this point.'

I think you are right that we failed but perhaps that failure is worth
examining?  I know I washed out when things moved toward violent and there
is that potential here.  I think Reiner may be on to something but he is
'worn out' by his earlier cooperative international poetry work and he
suggests the UN (irrelevant as it is to Bushites).  I also think Langer
rightly points out that viewing, picturing, or writing about 'them' "cannot
help but nourish belief in the inevitability of tragedy"

Langer ends sadly with affirming that we "Can't understand; can't
imagine....And they are right" and I don't have a solution, either, but
think these things worth thinking on?

This is such sad news.  I feel I owe a huge debt to Richard Caddel, as much
of my knowledge and love of modern & contemporary British poetry is due to
his work.  I found strong affinities & common ground there.  I did not know
Richard unfortunately.  Except perhaps in this way: I can hardly imagine a
life without Bunting or MacSweeney, or cheek or Upton for that matter.  So I
pass my sincerest & heartfelt condolences to those who did know Richard, his
friends and loved ones, those who must live a life beyond him, after him.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Burning  Deck Press is pleased to announce vol. 44 in the "Burning
Deck Poetry Books" series.

ELIZABETH WILLIS
Turneresque
Poetry, 96 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 1-886224-62-5 original paperback $10
ISBN 1-886224-63-3 paperback, signed edition $20
Publication date: April 15, 2003

The title plays off the style of J. M. W. Turner's paintings and
media mogul Ted Turner's revival of B-cinema as two competing
versions of the sublime. Like Turner's painting, the book embraces
both figuration and abstraction. It can be read as repeated acts of
"turning" - between visuality and sound, lyric and narrative tension,
the sheen of popular icons and the shadow of literary obscurity, the
celebrated and the invisible worlds.
      Each of the three anchoring sections of prose poems engages in a
dialogue with aspects of visual composition: with Turner and other
artists, with film, or with the "moving picture" of American culture
as framed by the car window. The lyric sections are composed as
counterpoint.

Elizabeth Willis was born in Bahrain and grew up in the American
midwest. She holds a Ph.D. from SUNY Buffalo and teaches at Wesleyan
University in Middletown, CT. She has published two books of poems:
The Human Abstract (Penguin, 1995: National Poetry Series winner) and
Second Law (Berkeley: Avenue B, 1993). Her poems have appeared in
American Poetry Review, Aufgabe, Chicago Review, Conjunctions, The
Germ, How2, etc.

      "She succeeds...in reinvesting language with the uniqueness of
origin: the breath gesture of each letter."-Joshua McKinney, Denver
Quarterly
     "Elizabeth Willis recovers the originating lyric impulse into a
haunting contemporary song. This is poetry of amazing intelligence
and grace."-Ann Lauterbach
      "...the poet reformulates the passage from innocence to
experience in a consideration of both the limits of lyric and the
worlds alive between the pronouns I and you." -Claudia Keelan, Poetry

i'm in Amsterdam with some friends, and last night we were thrown
out of a bar when the Arab bartender got a whiff of our American accents.

we didn't even HAVE TIME to cause trouble.  it was jarring, of course,
but i just couldn't get myself angry about it...which is so unusal for me.

as a little girl, my friend Uta survived the refugee camps with other
Germans after WWII.  for the past five years i've watched and listened
to her deal with the world from the standpoint of coming from a legacy
of tyranny.  there's something so amazing about the way Germans express
themselves when conflict arises, a strength in understanding WHY they
are to be held accountable if they do not prevent more disaster.

i've always believed we Americans have plenty to answer to for the
stress we put on the 3rd World, but it's feeling different since our invasion.
it's feeling WORSE MUCH WORSE and it's coming to terms with the language
we need to now find, a language like modern Germany's.

anyone else have feelings on this?
shoot me or stand and be shot with me in the new language.
don't be so fucking shy.

I was spit on in France (in 1990 right before the first gulf war and I was a

WARNING!

Impersonating Canadians abroad can be risky and embarrassing. It can involve
drinking large quantities of beer and attempting to speak French in an
attempt to impress attractive women. It's happened to me more than once, and
I'm Canadian!

Please be careful.

Renee forwardedthis quote to me
today:::::::unfortumnately quite jejune to our
times....





"Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order
to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for
patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both
emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And
when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and
the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the
leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the
citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear
and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their
rights unto the leader and gladly so. How do I know?
For this is what I have done. And I am Caesar."

-- Julius Caesar

there is also a user-friendly window that pops
up with information about how to navigate
my projects and other information about my
work

i am making all my projects consistent in design
like this because i will be having my work

i am receiving a great amount of work right now
from bulgaria and argentina and france

the french avant garde department has become permanent

critics

This Message

has been cleared by the military--

Last week, the war hadn't exactly become more confused
or complicated militarily, but had gotten muddier, dustier,
harder to cover. New colors were added to two or more people,

and Baghdad's palette added some red to our screens.
The war began to look bloody, in some instances,
violating the rules of embedded journalists, like something

dropped from a second-storey window and shattered.
Wait a minute, make that third-storey. Clear explanations
can contain the seeds of our own ruination, so we'll

eschew those, if you'll pardon my French. Shooting
at one miserable reporter isn't going to change the picture
much, but that isn't exactly the point, now is it? But what is?

That's what we've always wanted to know, and hesitated
to ask our Shiite and Sunni and Kurdish friends, lest they
pick up too much intelligence about our capacity for gathering

intelligent intelligence in a smart and straightforward way,
with or without tipping our cards. Stay tuned. Don't
touch that remote. More after this.

Hope you can make it!

The Walt Whitman Arts Center

is honored to present
one of our finest poets--

JOHN ASHBERY

 Tonight   WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 7:30 PM

Booksigning and reception to follow reading.

$6/ $4 students and seniors/ Free to members.

John Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York in 1927.  Best known as a poet,
he has published more than 20 collections beginning in 1953 with Turadot and
Other Poems.  In 1975 his Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award and the National Book Critics Award.  His
most recent volumes (1998-2002) are Wakefulness, Girls on the Run, Your Name
Here, As Umbrellas Follow Rain, and Chinese Whispers.

He is also well known for his writings on art, which began in 1957.  He
served as executive editor of Art News, and was art critic for New York
Magazine and Newsweek.  A selection of his art writings, Reported Sightings:
Art Chronicles 1957-1987, was published in 1989.  His further forays in
literary genres include the novel A Nest of Ninnies with James Schulyer, as
well as his collection, Three Plays.  A noted translator, Ashbery has
published numerous translations from the French including work by Artaud,
Raymond Roussel, Max Jacob and Peter Martory.  A selection of his prose
pieces is forthcoming from the University of Michigan Press.  His own work
has been translated into more than twenty languages.

Ashbery has held many prestigious academic positions including Distinguished
Professor at Brooklyn College 1980-90.  He delivered the Charles Eliot Norton
Lectures at Harvard in 1989-90, and since 1990 has been the Charles P.
Stevenson, Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.

His list of awards, grants and memberships in academic academies are so
numerous it has been said that he is a poet for whom new awards must be
created.  A few of the innumerable prizes and honors awarded to him over the
years include the Wallace Stevens Award, the Signet Society Medal for
Achievement in the Arts, the Robert Frost Medal, and the Grand Prix de
Biennales Internationales de Poesie.  He served as a  Chancellor of the
Academy of American Poets from 1988-99, and was a MacArthur "Genius" Fellow
from 1985-90.

O LICELINESS

Typically they trickle down the arm late at night, looking like little
armoured personnel carriers, those compact bodies, but can be expunged with
a flick.

Which is rather God-like, one thinks.

I can't say I eat them, not quite my taste, but I know the Mandarins wore
them along with their gowns. Like friends. But one begins to wonder, or is
it wander, in the self-proclaimed mind, about their generation, rather
Aristotelian methinks, as if they were born from mud, a swampy thought, a
morass like God, like the idea of holding a brain in one's hands.

That grey sponge. That spider's trail of crevasse.

And slowly as a tank what might be termed conscience turns, with an
undertaker's reluctance of pace, to an awareness of what do they call it? -
life

is as small

                as this planet to the cosmos

or the cold I had last Wednesday

                 or the louse I brushed away.




Best (!)

Reviving Uncle Sam/  Bicycles to Pull Corpse Across America

(Petaluma, California, Gothic News Service, 04/03) The descendants of
radical and progressive chicken farmers of America - including many of
Petaluma's new and anti-war citizens - gathered today for a public sendoff
of Uncle Sam=B9s corpse on a bicycle propelled pilgrimage across America.
Destined for an August revival celebration on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial, crowds gathered around the float at the intersection of Main and
Washington to witness the open wounds on Sam=B9s large red, white and blue
body which lay crumpled upside down on a large float -  his haggard, sad an=
d
open eyes barely able to look out on the crowds that stopped City traffic
for miles around.=20

   Petaluma, now a mainly white suburb north of San Francisco, spent most o=
f
the first half of the 20th Century known as the chicken and egg capital of
the nation. Founded and sustained by secular socialist, Yiddish speaking
chicken farmers, the community was internationally known for its
contriubtions to the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti, the Scottsboro Boys and
the Spanish Republic, including the participation of some of its members in
the famed anti-fascist Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

   "Much of the leadership was threatened and quieted during the McCarthy
period, including the executions of the Rosenbergs," said Eileen Fishman,
one of the daughters and organizers. "We=B9ve come back to revive our roots a=
s
well as join with our fellow citizens. Our pilgrimage is to send a message
of defeat to the neo-McCarthy/Ashroft alliance and to revive and protect ou=
r
Constitutional liberties."

   In the morning crown many concerned citizens lined up around the float t=
o
cover Sam=B9s costume with fresh and familiar stickers, including:
       Take Back America
       Rage Against the Coup
       Resist Repression
       Democracy Not Hypocrisy
       If You Are Not Outraged
       You Are Not Paying Attention

Others took turns to place painted eggs, chicken feather pillows, as well a=
s
other procreative symbols under and around Sam=B9s body and face.

At eleven o=B9clock, the float - pulled by the "Abe Wheeler Brigade", its
volunteer members drawn from Bicycle Peace Coalitions up and down the West
Coast =AD slowly pedaled out of town. The cross-continental trip will stop to
rally citizens in town rallies across the country including a major July 4t=
h
stop in Wichita, Kansas on July 4th. There, in a nocturnal gathering, 100
poets will join in a rare choral reading of the "Wichita Vortex Sutra,"
considered by many as one of Allen Ginsberg=B9s major poems.

"Allen was the visionary baby of our elders," is all Ms. Fishman would say
as to why the poem was chosen. "You might go read it or get the recording o=
f
Allen," she told reporters. "The work is really quite tender and very
American."

In addition to providing muscle power, the bicycle coalition forces expect
to fend off attacks from O=B9Reilly and other Fox Network Cable SUV brigades,
some of whom have already publicly promised to threaten the highway
pilgrimage.

"When we get to the Lincoln Memorial, there will a public celebration in
which we crack fresh eggs, revive Sam with feather ticklers, stand him up,
show off his stickers and let him dance and sing a little to the bike
coalition brass band - nothing too corny =AD while we let Lincoln=B9s shrine
invoke the bravery of our Petaluma elders and this country=B9s many other
progressive ancestors," Ms. Fishman said, just before hopping on her bike t=
o
leave town.=20

 Stop The War

 By Dennis J. Kucinich

 US House of Representatives, 4/2/03

Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), who leads
opposition to the War in Iraq within the House, today,
issued the following statement on the House floor:

“Stop the war now. As Baghdad will be encircled, this
is the time to get the UN back in to inspect Baghdad
and the rest of Iraq for biological and chemical
weapons.  Our troops should not have to be the ones
who will find out, in combat, whether Iraq has such
weapons.  Why put our troops at greater risk?  We
could get the United Nations inspectors back in.
“Stop the war now. Before we send our troops into
house-to-house combat in Baghdad, a city of five
million people.  Before we ask our troops to take up
the burden of shooting innocent civilians in the fog
of war.
“Stop the war now. This war has been advanced on lie
upon lie.  Iraq was not responsible for 9/11.  Iraq
was not responsible for any role al-Qaeda may have had
in 9/11.  Iraq was not responsible for the anthrax
attacks on this country.  Iraq did not tried to
acquire nuclear weapons technology from Niger.  This
war is built on falsehood.
“Stop the war now. We are not defending America in
Iraq.  Iraq did not attack this nation.  Iraq has no
ability to attack this nation.  Each innocent civilian
casualty represents a threat to America for years to
come and will end up making our nation less safe.  The
seventy-five billion dollar supplemental needs to be
challenged because each dime we spend on this war
makes America less safe.  Only international
cooperation will help us meet the challenge of
terrorism.  After 9/11 all Americans remember we had
the support and the sympathy of the world.  Every
nation was ready to be of assistance to the United
States in meeting the challenge of terrorism.  And
yet, with this war, we have squandered the sympathy of
the world.  We have brought upon this nation the anger
of the world.  We need the cooperation of the world,
to find the terrorists before they come to our shores.
“Stop this war now. Seventy-five billion dollars more
for war.  Three-quarters of a trillion dollars for tax
cuts, but no money for veterans’ benefits.  Money for
war.  No money for health care in America, but money
for war.  No money for social security, but money for
war.  We have money to blow up bridges over the Tigris
and the Euphrates, but no money to build bridges in
our own cities.  We have money to ruin the health of
the Iraqi children, but no money to repair the health
of our own children and our educational programs.
“Stop this war now. It is wrong.  It is illegal.  It
is unjust and it will come to no good for this
country.
“Stop this war now. Show our wisdom and our humanity,
to be able to stop it, to bring back the United
Nations into the process.  Rescue this moment.  Rescue
this nation from a war that is wrong, that is unjust,
that is immoral.
“Stop this war now


Kucinich: President Continues to Mislead The Country
About the War

On March 31, 2003, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich
(D-OH), who leads opposition in the House to the war
in Iraq, issued the following statement:

“Today, President Bush said the following to Coast
Guard personnel: Our victory will remove a sponsor of
terror, armed with weapons of terror. Our victory will
uphold the just demands of the United Nations and the
civilized world.
 “This statement is another example of rhetoric that
the Administration is using to mislead the public in
the war against Iraq. Iraq has not been proven to have
weapons of mass destruction, by either the United
Nations or the United States.  Further, this statement
falsely implies that the United Nations and ‘the
civilized world’ sanctioned war in Iraq. It also
incorrectly implies that the United Nations sanctioned
regime change and the removal of Saddam Hussein.
“This Administration has consistently misled the
public on the cost of war, the cause for war, the
facts of war, and the support for war. It is time to
end this war immediately and bring the troops home.”

Sequins
by Vannina Maestri
(translated by Kristin Prevallet and Lucy McNair)


what we are
we are always, always
FORGET IT

calaf prince of an empire taken by enemies finds in Peking his old
confidant barak whom he believed lost in Peking the young prince wants
to try his luck at the court although barak warns him that it is a sad
place the princess turandot decapitating all the princes who request
        the scene is far-east

official showcases
no cries
all wounds finally
stop automatically perhaps
no life is carried

and how is this possible? this in which nothing lacks

snatched away then and blessed

by there so that taken away       all cracked

yes?

feast of beasts of missions labored and confirmed

yes

cries and passers-by

everything suddenly separates

yelling barefooted scattered polluted

quarrel

QUARREL

besides should we have to say here everything is absolute

suddenly later all these cries all these gulls
leap now

to his hand when they are not able to solve the three riddles and
hardly had barak brought back what is anyway public in the whole world
when the last prince he of samarakande was decapitated the queen mother
of samarkande she who is in terrible pain curses the spot and throws
the noxious portrait of turnadot in the dust

lamento

it remains and time flows by

gone ahead and lost behind

My wife and I were good friends of Ric's for over twenty years, and loved
both him and his wife Ann and their wonderful daughter Lucy, who gave so
much joy to Ric.  Hard to find words to share, but I thought, since I had
just reviewed his Magpie Words, that I would post the last part of the
review by way of saying something about both Ric and his work.  Here it is,
sadly apt,  as the section of the poem quoted touches on the accidental
death of his son, Tom:

making a music out of language
making a moon
red air flame under stars
yesterdays filled with singing
yesterdays text of today
unreal // distinguish
can words make grief
so good // finding
naming one unchanging and changed.
Caddel's grief  (the poem is in memory of his son Tom) only deepens the
readers sense of the parted that ends the very first section of the
poem.   Certainly, the son, fixed by death, is both unchanging in memory
and yet changed, echoing Yeats, changed utterly.  I mention Yeats, both to
show an affiliation for depth, but also to invoke the doubled, even tripled
largeness of the perception that emerges from the passage.  In Caddels
work, "Yesterdays text of today" has taken the measure of that singing of
another time, not only that half-rejected Northern sound which so nourishes
his lines but also the instancing of an imagined Britain lying in all its
aura of a lost Golden Age.  It is all there, placed under Caddel's
impressive palimpsest.

[realized that the language has thrown me back on myself and not attending
for the past few days:  have been referring to Sontag, Susan as Lerner,
Judith and the only skeleton in my Freudian closet to save academics the

I prefer to think not in national categories.
Bloody reality of politique throws all back.

No - it is not as easy.

US out of balance - turns the world out of balance (in a martial act).
The american left wing mute for a too long time (after 0911) - made the
right wing louder (more and more dominant).

Ah - still a democracy.
Voices form public - influence governments.

Get back to communication (>comprehension).

Nietsche is alive?

Jessica Lynch has been rescued.  "That's great!"
Do we have to inhabit Bush's mind?
I"m depressed.  What does that mean when my granddaughter wants to play?


would suspect play may be the solution and Sontag does in fact reference the
grotesque but she may not be aware.  The other confusion here is that the
polls in Germany are not terribly positive at this point and they don't
think the USCentric role is a good role model for them.  I may concur on
this but money from the Ukraine and former Russian (I presume what they mean
is men from what was Russia) influence in Iragi strategy is tossed in to the
pot

But the background music today drums in an upbeat way


Dow UP

NASDAQ up

and Heraldo called the parody of a parody and someone is only speaking out
in controlled environments

Jessica from Palestine {does NOT rhyme with rhyme or wine!!! they say] is
debriefed
something debunked and spin of the HARDball by the HARDballers flexing
muscle on the screen as the Tall Texan of the Grand Old Opry patriotically
excoriates the Dixie Chick who slipped but the stand up guys [in my
experience stand-UP guys don't or at least those that talk about it] are not
the same Grantland Rice knew in his childhood here or those Akbar wanted to
be or those that were mown down at the Battle of Stones River which is the
name of the mall nearby filled with SUVs and cell phones.  rabbit ears
c'mon, let's hear some chatter in the dugout trenches there, rev up the

"It doesn't get any more realistic than this, wow, WOW, WOWIE"  "We are
really embedded."

"Good shot to the head!"  "The Captain just killed him in the foyer."  "We'd
be anxious with these bad guys here, but these guys are gung-ho."
"Let's continue listening in.  He's describing this so well." [I don't think
the correct term for a gyro is a 'grunt']

The "He said, 'We're Marines, we took Iwo Jima, this is S=H=I=and I'll let
you put in the other letter.'" story has aired at least once in every 15
min. sound byte shown today.

"It seems this has been disconnected.  This is the most dramatice realistic
reality TV.".

"We're in the thick of it." as if we can't see and hear we are in the thick
of it?  "This is like 'Apocalypse Now'...I've seen War movies..."  "We saw
his head exPLOODe in front of us."  "This is like the Alamo, we see a charge
coming in...

Al Kut on the Tigris, and you probably heard and saw this sound byte
numerous times in the days to come?

I had a patient see me this morning who does have some problems with
rumination (among tohewr things).  She used to spend her free time watching
her collection of war movies.  One of her goals in therapy is to be able to
watch more comedies.

This afternoon I will spend some time wih PTSDed vets

And just so I don't get my credentials yanked let me say I did my time and
received a letter of commendation from both the USArmy and the SDS.

WEST COAST LINE & KSW Present:
"Writing Rupture: Iranian Emigration Literature"
A Launch for West Coast Line #36/3

Join WCL guest editor Peyman Vahabzadeh for a talk and
 reading to launch this important new issue of West Coast
Line, featuring work from exiled Iranian writers living in
Canada, the US, and other parts of the diaspora.

The issue includes new poetry and prose in English
ranslation from Farsi, critical/poetics essays, and a
photo-essay on Sahra Karimi, an exiled Iranian actor and
activist. Other writers include Yadollah Royai, Azadeh
Farahmand, Behnam Bavandpour Faramarz Soleimani, Verya
Mazhar, , Hossein
Fazeli, Ali Reza Hosseini, Zara Houshmand , Chuka Chakad,
Hossein Nushazar, Nilofar Shidmehr, Mehroosh Mazarei,
Khosrow Davami, Ali Negahban, and Shahla Sepehr Bebe.

Peyman Vahabzadeh (1961, Tehran) will posthumously write
his bio. A Vancouverite, he has served his time living as
a young revolutionary, activist, worker, wartime soldier,
refugee, and university student, his son's proven father,
his parent's unproven son, his wife's dubious husband, and
other important things he fails to remember. He enjoys
teaching hope before eclipsing into despair and likes to
hike, live in Italy and find a cure for his terminal
accent. His unsuccessful attempts at not publishing have
resulted in a number of unfortunate books, essays, poems,
short stories, critics, and reviews in Persian, English
and German (including, recently, Articulated Experiences:
Toward a Radical Phenomenology of
Contemporary Social Movements [SUNY Press, 2003]) -- works
that, he prays, will soon be forgotten.

An excerpt from "Thinking with an Accent":

"Thinking with an accent disturbs the dominant discourse
by changing its fundamental terms. It always brings here
something foreign from there, and it leaves what is
foreign here in an improper place through speaking with an
accent, just before making yet another departure. As such,
thinking
with an accent transgresses the boundaries that perpetuate
the illusion of dwelling in a permanent place called home
and shows the unhomely character of the world."

Good Day

Our hands were so tired from changing the lightbulbs that we saw above =
all those people's heads. Donald Rumsfield won't even be a name we'll =
recognize in an hundred years. Not even Americans. With their flashes. =
It happened when you threw the lard into the frying pan, the third =
degree burns all up and down my arms. And that makes my hands tired too, =
I guess.=20

Good Day

I watched television today and wanted to scream at CNN and the BBC World =
news that they were capitalizing on the suffering of millions. But then, =
why is this poem any different?

Good Day

Went out to buy matte medium to cover up the numbers I stuck on =
cardboard. Couldn't decide between matte or glossy. Now I'm eating ice =
cream while a mother on the front page of the sun gazes disdainfully =
away from a photographer. Her child is in the forefront. There are =
certain things that I wouldn't want to see mass produced and ice cream =
is definitely one of them. It is most likely a disgusting procedure.

Good Day

It doesn't matter anymore how long things actually take. Once they are =
recorded and archived they can be made into any length. I can edit them =
into any length. But then that's always been true of really important =
things. Somehow sunlight spills through the bedroom window, across the =
bonsai's leaves, over the blue sheets, the dark blue sheets, and makes a =
distorted square shape on the carpet with black shadows that resemble =
evergreen branches waving in a silent wind. Saskatoon conversations and =
different places. The war began when I was away. Maybe one of the most =
disgusting things will be that after all of this very little will have =
changed. At least over here.

Good day

I brought home a painting from work today and put it in front of the =
television. For some reason we don't have cable. And then I got another =
bowl of ice cream. It might seem like I eat ice cream everyday but =
that's not quite true. I don't eat ice cream every day. Everybody's =
angry. People shout about not being recognized, others are bombed for =
being recognized, people feel victimized, colonized, angry at being =
painted as the force, and yet Bush still warns the coast guard to be =
vigilant against homeland attacks. Some of my best friends are from =
Winnipeg, she said at the border. But it wasn't to the coast guard. =
Undefended for so long, along its length it stretches thing these days. =
When do we tell the Master that he is helpless without US. The emperor =
can't even get dressed.

Good Day

Hot afternoon when work finished. And a friend signaled in from Ohio. =
This program autocorrects my typing so if I make a mistake and it =
recognizes it, then it changes it to the correct spelling. Imagine the =
same thing could happen with grammar? Each letter is targeted and the =
difference abolished. Haunting PNAC. We set ourselves up as victims and =
shake our heads about what to do with GB. Well, why not decide we won't =
forgive him? Like he's some sort of rain cloud. Hell, people complain =
and do more to a cashier than they do when basic human decency is =
transgressed. On my webmail page it has a banner ad that advertises the =
American Green Card Lottery. You could get a green card. Sign up for the =
American Green Card Lottery today! Do they even know what is going on =
with their own country? Rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, =
gave through from the night, that our flag was still there. Maybe they =
do.



Good Day

March to the codes it changes into the fool's day with the words: =
INVALID ARGUMENT. The codes we're slaves too, such as: "eat something", =
or "buy this shirt", or "invade Iraq". All I want to do is get this =
interview online. Can we speed this up?

Good Day

The ghost of Ulysses visited my window today as I was chatting with a =
friend. I put a dish of milk out for him. Only to learn later that cats =
shouldn't have milk because it is bad for them. US defends progress, =
allies pound Iraq.

Good Day

It is a battle for control each moment between sleep and cartoons. That =
voices lisp in many tones over faded cells. And it could be the sun any =
minute now. A storm mumbles quietly through each individual's claim to =
collective identity; that it cleans the palette of beauty, scours the =
hard pan, dust over the filigreed cracks. Both say the other is a relic, =
evil, antlers and crosshairs in the middle east. Each new horror makes =
the last newsworthy. The norms can be heard even if we can't see the =
images, it is still possible to follow the narrative as it is always =
played out away from the blast. Tents blasted and rocks thrashed from =
the center. Epidermal splices strike difference from accord, strips the =
grass from the idea of lawn, that it could all just be a matter of skin. =
It isn't just style, it's lifestyle. Someone tell the clones. It's the =
old take a hostage then take the target scam over breakfast. Simple =
words take on more than their usual weight of meaning, such that =
breakfast splits and its surface suggests the outcome. Spread your wings =
and fly.

Good Day

Writing with/after Roy Miki knocks at my door. The breaks were =
sustained, were stunning. Between the page and book end, the period =
senses, a duration, it could be that I bought you these flowers --- =
snapdragons, blue bells, daffodils --- but even their stories are =
fraught with weather, in as much to say this war will not be televised, =
it will be television. Craft, then, a chest heaves, gets buried and =
mapped. That the train moves into a tunnel, or a tunnel forms around the =
train is hot air at least, the wind. From the west, next word: =
'Discovery' and also to channel, the lock - able society everywhere in =
the (GAP or GNP) chains. There is a belief you were talking about while =
we ate beets at our small kitchen table. Or were you talking about =
belief at all? Maybe it was me. Historically, all I could hear was my =
own voice anyway, and your eyes as they quietly closed.

Good Day

Today the nervous, modest, quiet laughter hides so much bitterness and =
anger. The alarm clock you forgot to set fifty years ago, some would =
say, is largely responsible for this. Well, I don't know about that, but =
I do know that the weather sure has been nice lately, even for tactical =
operations. But what happens when the sand settles? Aha! She exclaimed, =
you've colonized the moment. And exceeded my expectations. There are so =
many reasons within the record of the victorious that make me sad and =
ashamed. Today the toll rises by the second.

Good Day

Snow began to fall. A whole day before the computer. There's at least a =
foot outside and it seems to be going for another. Unstoppable advance. =
The snow might yet be the last uncontrollable aspect of nature to fall. =
At least that's what Thomas Merton had to say in his essay on Ionesco's =
Rhinoceros and Rain in the book Sources. Well, he said it about rain, =
but snow seems even less likely to be useful. Except maybe to keep a =
person in doors before their computer, writing.

i have two new projects that appeared online
last week


CLUB BIBLIOTECH
www.club-bibliotech.com


"What an incredible project--I'm amazed
at it's potential to ablate the passive reception of text/ image and
catalyze perception of what tools we socially use and how we use them to
what ends.  I find your repetition accomplishing two things (perhaps much
more--but will have to contemplate more) in oppositional, but not
necessarily uncomplimentary, movements: arousing awareness of the
politico-economic base--what processes are most common to our daily
interactions as a sex-tech-text centered society (a culture based on the
binary, 0's and 1's; male/ female--and voyeurism--subject/ object, self/
other divisions); and at the same time lulling in a chant, the prayer to the
feed-back loop, mise en abyme, the veil we wrap ourselves in"
---claire barbetti (janus head)


GLOBAL TEXT STRATEGIES
www.global-text-strategies.com

"Your sydney lewis project contains a number of interesting features, all of
which combined call into question the significance of the so-called
signifying text as such. First, the political thrust counterbalances other
elements, providing a fuller picture, making the critique more effective.
Then the punctuation scheme with the vertical lines gives the minimum in
terms of articulation indicators to the reader, but that's really all that
is necessary. Having everything in upper-case letters makes me feel like
something really important is being said here, and it's up to me to figure
out what it is. How are human beings capable of destroying ourselves? This
age-old theme must be one of the most difficult to treat in a fresh and
arresting manner."

A petition that the US be brought before the ICC (which the US has refused
to recognize)
http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/whatsnew/action/actionAlert.asp
"To: International Criminal Court: On March 21, 2003, the US, UK and other
forces launched a massive air strike against Iraq as part of the US
military plan, 'shock and awe.' In the first 48 hours of this attack some
3,000 precision-guided bombs were fired at or near Baghdad, a densely
populated city of 5.6 million... It is illegal too to launch indiscriminate
as well as disproportionate attacks and acts intended to spread terror
among the civilian population. The Rome Statute specifically prohibits
intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian
infrastructure. The so-called 'shock and awe' tactics described above
constitute a war crime in violation of the Rome Statute... I respectfully
request that you initiate an investigation into this situation under
Article 15 of the Rome Statute against all persons subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court. This should include investigation of all
officials involved, including all heads of States taking part in the war."

Swiss Foreign Ministry begins to document US war crimes in Iraq:
http://www.islam-online.net/english/News/2003-04/01/article06.shtml



"The US military last used ground-based cluster munitions in the 1991 Gulf
War. More than 4,000 Iraqi and Kuwaiti civilians were killed or wounded by
the duds after the war. During the war, 80 US casualties were reported from
the duds."

Centcom Briefing Sonnet

(In progress) — entered Iraq to remove the regime.
There is much pain there. Across the vastnesses
The coalition remains robust, with 49 countries
between us, small birds carry messages. The sky,

supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. We continue
wanting, above all, to be blue, to remember those who
have attacked regime targets over the last 48 hours
in Baghdad and several cities throughout the country,

as everlasting fire pours through space. Men dying in
precision attacks against surface-to-surface missiles
as Republican Guard forces return, to feed them, bear
their children, This is a strike against an Iraqi television

service building in Karbala, and it was attacked two nights ago.
This is a Ba'ath Party headquarters building in al-Hillah.
This is a military headquarters building in western Iraq.
A little too much beauty is so hard to bear—a fuel truck

in a revetement near al Kut, an ammo truck near An Najaf,
targets of opportunity, as this next video shows.

{Dirty Milk is a reactive hyperpoem in progress; these
are some of the texts that will be used for the work}










Murmurs alkali through rain-jambed streets and settle
on her sleeves like a velour of pods. In the West, I
breathe in the hard powder of soulful luck; as a
witness to a shy morning etched on my glasses, the
contemplation of rain and its relations (light, sound,
coolness, parking lot) also take on a weight and shape
not quite as symmetrical as the hunger for her skin
inside an orange for lunch. As you lean into me, and I
take your activity as a cue to transform, what
dimensions emit a sour arc, and which ones flicker?




It's like talking through water; watch her ripple,
concentric and peeling, as one by one you drop words
down her spine.  As for her honey: jagged touch; edgy
rubbing in the elegy room. Most of me is an agent in
search of reach. I love the fling of her, hooped and
innocent, across televised bombings that linger behind
the eyelids: crowds of Bosch. Women and children crawl
over each other to get through the screen. Men
dissolve in illegible wars with all the immediacy of
the newest painkillers: slip me onto your tongue; let
me rain on your cells.



As you lean closer into me, leaving echo after echo of
fashion and chemical  in the arc you draw with your
voice , I shift accordingly, opening in every center
of myself a white eye to hear your deep green veneer
crackle under morning's noise.  She's talking to
no-one in a room cooly crowded with dead lovers and
their implausible tallness. Though edges of sugar
gnarl in her sleeves and knot in spoonfuls of work,
the medicine remains aimlessness in front of a
microphone, waves taken in and creamed to blue,
letting the stars of spring cleaning empty their foul
routes into black screens talking back at her, sassy.
Everything I say  upsets the loop.

Awake again, after breakfast, Lynda and I sit in the living
room and turn on the war with the sound off. Paula Zahn,
the Doris Day of cable news, moves her lips and eyebrows
in the Time-Life Building studio, where behind her, beyond
her right shoulder, some doofus on the sidewalk is thumbing
his cellphone, calling his girlfriend or wife or whatever to let
her know that he's on TV. Then John King comes on and
moves his lips about George W. Bush, who's in Camp Lejeune,
North Carolina, to entertain the troops and their families.
The cat missed his catbox again, and I sort of shunned him
for a while, but now we're friends again, though he's off
somewhere sleeping, being a nocturnal sort of guy.

        The Swiss foreign minister, Micheline Calmy-Rey, has abandoned

        of the war in Iraq.

        On Tuesday the ministry said it was not going ahead with the

They've not abandoned the plan to document war crimes. They've abandoned
the plan to list the names of US victims of war crimes.

Just head over to Dutch Flowers near the Spui and you can forget all about
it.

My experience of Amsterdam as of late, along with some friends of mine who
are Dutch citizens (now living in the US): let's just say there are clear
signs that the West is beginning to pay the price for its exploitation of
the Middle East, on a person-by-person basis.  And much of that is being
expressed on the streets of Amsterdam.

i'm in Amsterdam with some friends, and last night we were thrown
out of a bar when the Arab bartender got a whiff of our American accents.

we didn't even HAVE TIME to cause trouble.  it was jarring, of course,
but i just couldn't get myself angry about it...which is so unusal for me.

as a little girl, my friend Uta survived the refugee camps with other
Germans after WWII.  for the past five years i've watched and listened
to her deal with the world from the standpoint of coming from a legacy
of tyranny.  there's something so amazing about the way Germans express
themselves when conflict arises, a strength in understanding WHY they
are to be held accountable if they do not prevent more disaster.

i've always believed we Americans have plenty to answer to for the
stress we put on the 3rd World, but it's feeling different since our
invasion.
it's feeling WORSE MUCH WORSE and it's coming to terms with the language
we need to now find, a language like modern Germany's.

anyone else have feelings on this?
shoot me or stand and be shot with me in the new language.
don't be so fucking shy.

Dear Friends of POG:

I’m writing to introduce you to POG, a Tucson-based non-profit arts
organization whose mission is to present to the public the work of
innovative poets and other artists, and to ask you to consider becoming a
POG Corporate Patron or Sponsor.

This is POG’s seventh season of public arts programming.  Our Poetry in
Action series presents nine or ten Tucson events per year, typically pairing
a reading by a poet with a presentation by a visual artist or musician, and
a visiting presenter with a local one.  This cross-over programming helps to
build an audience base for experimental artists working in various media,
and draws attention to the ways in which Tucson’s own avant-garde artists
are part of a wider process of innovation.

POG is supported annually by the Arizona Commission for the Arts, the
National Endowment for the Arts, and the Tucson-Pima Arts Council. However,
these public monies cover only about one-third of our annual budget, which
in recent years has typically exceeded $6,000.  We need to raise the
remainder through a combination of event admissions, special fundraisers,
and private and corporate donations.

We hope you’ll consider becoming a Spring 2003 Patron, for the modest amount
of $100, or a Sponsor, for $50.  Both Patrons and Sponsors are listed in all
POG publicity.  In addition, Patrons receive two free gifts and two free
admissions to all POG events; Sponsors receive one of each.  For
contributions exceeding $100, POG will gladly negotiate additional
perquisites.

POG is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation.  All contributions
are fully tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

If you’d like to purchase a Season Subscription or become a POG Sponsor or
POG Patron, simply complete the accompanying form and mail it, along with
your check  made out to POG, to: POG, 5029 N Post Trail, Tucson, AZ  85750.

Thank you for your interest in POG programming.

Sincerely,



Tenney Nathanson
President, POG Board of Directors

Has anyone out there read Valentine Cunningham’s “British Writers of the
Thirties” of late?  The parallels with our own moment are amazing.
You’ve got:

---suspicion of the lyric ‘I’ (pp. 214-220)
---debates over straight-up agitprop vs. experimental modernism (pp.
296-303)
---worries about the value of writing in doomy times (pp. 97-105)
---air of war and impending destruction (including a sub-genre of the
period Cunningham calls the ‘Gas Bomb Novel’)  (pp. 200-203)
---urgent call for writers to be political, take a stand, ‘go over’ to a
side (Chapter 7)
---crappy economy (tho’ much worse than ours) (pp. 37-39)

and a whole lot more.  With thoughts on the historical bouncing through
blogland, Cunningham’s well worth a glance.  How soon till Auden’s line
from 1937’s ‘Gare du Midi’—“he walks briskly to infect a city”—turns
poetry into some creepy form of prophecy?

Subject: Impeach Bush! Campaign Update






Dear VoteToImpeach Member,

Thanks to the outpouring of support from founding supporters of the
VoteToImpeach movement, the first full page ad of the impeachment campaign
was placed in the New York Times on March 19 - Bush's ultimatum day - in the
front section of the paper, page A23.

The political impact of the New York Times was far-reaching. The circulation
of the New York Times extends all over the country and all over the world.
In turn, the response of people across the country to the ad was
magnificent. The office was flooded with thousands of letters from people
who filled out a VoteToImpeach ballot. Tens of thousands more immediately
went on line and voted to impeach Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Ashcroft for
their criminal conduct in waging a war of aggression against the people of
Iraq, wantonly sacrificing the lives of U.S. servicemen and women, and for
the assault on our civil rights and civil liberties at home.

The VoteToImpeach newspaper ad campaign is expanding.

With your help, we are now seeking to place the full page ad in the San
Francisco Chronicle in the next week.

      The ad campaign is letting millions of Americans know about the
constitutional mechanism of impeachment to remove from office elected
officials who commit high crimes and misdemeanors, who violate the trust of
the people and engage in abuse of power. The campaign for an impeachment
process is building at the grassroots level. Let's do everything within our
power to make it grow, in our neighborhoods, in our communities, and in
Congress.

You can also help spread the word about the impeachment campaign by
encouraging your favorite websites to place the VoteToImpeach graphic link.
This is easily done, click here for instructions.

People around the country are also making efforts to place the ad in their
local newspapers. The pdf of the ad is available at the
www.VoteToImpeach.org website, and we can also assist if your paper needs
any additional camera-ready files. Please let us know if the ad has been
placed in a local newspaper in your area.

On Sunday, March 23 the full page ad appeared in the Madison Capitol Times
(Wisconsin). We are interested in placing the ad in newspapers read by
different communities around the country in large and smaller cities and
towns.

We have had many requests for VoteToImpeach materials and are happy to
announce that signs and stickers for the VoteToImpeach campaign will be
available at the peace demonstrations taking place on Saturday April 12 in
Washington, DC (12 noon at the Washington Monument) and in San Francisco (12
noon at the Civic Center - Polk & Grove). Many VoteToImpeach members are
coming as contingents to these April 12 national demonstrations calling for
an end to the war in Iraq, which will be part of a world-wide day of rallies
for peace across the globe. The VoteToImpeach contingents will be saying
that a significant step towards peace is the impeachment of George W. Bush
and Co.

Congratulations on such a successful campaign launch -- lets keep the
pressure building!

Ransacked Like Troy

We brought our whispers with us, made a significant apparatus. Whichever
vicinity recognized form as ransacked makes no difference when pageantry is
flammable and addressed. With everything kindled and seizing fortunes, how
do you begin to match the visage note for note completely. The legends
happened. I want to select the changeable hours of an until now. Whatever is
illuminated blocks the grammar of so many mutable faces. I am not of those
letters, not of a name, my name not addressed or adequately intoned. All the

Noah Eli Gordon:


Tiger, Tiger

                   for James Meetze



This is what I recall about snow

inside a very small tiger, about snow

in the shape of a very small tiger, about

the expansive relics, the symbols

sewn into silk, the story they told

& those who listened, who listening

were circled, enclosed in the weave,

assuming the miniscule stitch

causing the eye of a very small tiger

to appear as habitually open, the habits

with which one accords a very small tiger

the grace of brittle legs & ardent longing

& the habitat a very small tiger treks

collectively assist those who take

full responsibility & those who

assail one another gregariously, untigerlike,

in translating the outlandish texts,

weather stations & amplitude with which

one unmaking a very small tiger

transmits unrelated data into something

analogous to the microscopic computations

evolving the paradox of an exact replica

of a very small tiger into its opposite,

both non-very & un-small, lacking

striation, emblematic of a suppressed

emotion, of the movement a very small tiger

makes when protecting its young

or padding itself with snow

so as to appear larger, or succinctly,

a swallowing of the landscape in order

to avoid the inverse, the extinction

of a very small tiger & those

who claim thinking machines inevitably

revoke the omniscience one grants

the act of taking a very small tiger

by the tail, of superfluous yearning

for non-flesh-eating mammals & iridescent

oil slicks in the shape of a very small tiger,

upon which the snow falls gratuitously,

evoking the experience of physical action

as the architecture a very small tiger

emanates from, as the ink expended

therein & also the yarn, lion-envy

& the rusting of numerous weathervanes.

Noah Eli Gordon's first book, The Frequencies, a prose poem sequence, is due
out late this spring from Tougher Disguises Press. His work has appeared or
is forthcoming from Hambone, American Letters & Commentary, jubilat,
Syllogism, Volt and elsewhere. A regular reviewer for Boston Review, his
criticism has appeared in such magazines as Jacket, Raintaxi, Slope and
Verse. The Whalebone Essays, the moniker for his on going collaborative work
with the poets Eric Baus, Nick Moudry and Travis Nichols, is currently in
its fourth volume, already having produced a collection of poetry, a long
play and an extended single poem ( currently serialized at:
http://www.castagraf.com). Along with Sara Veglahn and five other local
poets, he is an editor for Baffling Combustions. Look for Nick Moudry's
chapbook, "a poem, a movie & a poem" coming soon from his new chapbook
series through Braincase press.

The Perpetual Motion Roadshow is a monthly indie-press showcase on
wheels that will feature
eclectic international talent —poets, artists, writers— at small venues
in four states and two provinces.

Every month, the Roadshow will hit seven cities in one week: Chicago,
New York, Cleveland, Cincinatti, Boston, Toronto, and Montreal. In each
city, the performers will be joined by at least one local favourite. The
first month's show (April 14-20) will present acclaimed Toronto comic
artist Marc Ngui, transgressive Boston writer Charlie-girl Anders, and
Montreal/NYC spoken-word artist Corey Frost.

The Perpetual Motion Roadshow is organized and run by writers, artists,
and performers who believe that independent small publishing is as
important as it is surprising. There’s no corporate budget behind the
Roadshow, just the cooperation of indie-press publishers and admirers
across the northeast, who offer their microphones and their spare
futons. Find out more at www.nomediakings.net

The starting point:
The tour kicks off at 7 pm on Monday, April 14, at the Soft Skull
Shortwave bookstore in Brooklyn, at 71 Bond St. (corner State). Charlie
will be reading her trans-tastic fiction, Corey’s performance will ask
ethical questions about the eating of fruit, and Marc will be showing
slides and doing voices for all his anti-capitalist cartoon creations.
They will be joined by Brooklyn poet Wanda Phipps. And it’s all FREE, of
course.

There will be independent-small-press books, of course, like Corey’s
short story collection My Own Devices and Marc’s graphic novel Enter
Avariz, both recent releases from Montreal’s conundrum press, and
Charlie’s brand new magazine, Other.

Announcements will shortly be made about the Roadshow's other April
stops. Come out and take in the show as it rumbles through town in a
Honda Civic. Come along if you like. It all happens during National
Heimlich Maneuver Week. It's educational.

instrumentals by, among others, Peter Blegvad, Rob Burger, Jimmy Fallon, Bob
Holman, John Kruth, Willie Nile, Ed Sanders, Fisher Stevens, John
Ventimiglia, Anne Waldman, and special guests.

Willner has produced music for stage, film, television, and record, and
worked with Allen Ginsberg, Laurie Anderson, William Burroughs, Lou Reed,
Dr. John, and Marianne Faithful, to name a few. Following in the tradition
of Basho, Buson, Shiki, and other poets, Kerouac experimented with this
centuries-old genre, taking it beyond strict syllable counts into what he
believed was the form's essence. This volume has supplemented a core haiku
manuscript from Kerouac's archives with a generous selection from both
published and unpublished sources.

Old age in the towns.
The heart without an owner.
Love without any object.

Hatred there is no cure for.

Western journalists beaten, starved by Americans
By Essam Al-Ghalib, war correspondent
Arab News, 3 April 2003

Two western journalists have arrived safely back in Kuwait
City after being arrested, beaten up and deprived of food
and water in Iraq ? by members of the US Army?s military
police.

Arab News has learned that Luis Castro and Victor Silva,
both reporters working for RTP Portuguese television, were
held for four days, had their equipment, vehicle and video
tapes confiscated, and were then escorted out of Iraq by
the 101st Airborne Division.

Despite possessing the proper "unilateral journalist"
accreditation issued by the coalition forces' central
command, both journalists were detained.

Their ordeal at the hands of the Americans is in stark
contrast to that received by Newsday journalists in
Baghdad, who yesterday in Jordan described as "humane"
their treatment at the hands of their Iraqi interrogators
despite suffering various indignities. "I have covered 10
wars in the past six years ? in Angola, Afghanistan,
Zaire, and East Timor. I have been arrested three times in
Africa, but have never been subjected to such treatment or
been physically beaten before," Castro said in an
exclusive interview with Arab News.

"The Americans call themselves liberators and freedom
fighters, but look what they have done to us," he added.

Castro and Silva entered Iraq 10 days ago. They had been
to Umm Qasr and Basra and were traveling to Najaf when
they were stopped by the military police.

According to Castro, their accredited identification was
checked and they were given the all clear to proceed.

"Suddenly, for no reason, the situation changed," Castro
told Arab News. "We were ordered down on the ground by the
soldiers. They stepped on our hands and backs and
handcuffed us.

"We were put in our own car. The soldiers used our
satellite phones to call their families at home. I begged
them to allow me to use my own phone to call my family,
but they refused. When I protested, they pushed me to the
ground and kicked me in the ribs and legs."

"I believe the reason we were detained was because we are
not embedded with the US forces," he continued. "Embedded
journalists are always escorted by military minders. What
they write is controlled and, through them, the military
feeds its own version of the facts to the world. When
independent journalists such as us come around, we pose a
threat because they cannot control what we write."

After being held for four days, they were transported to
the 101st Airborne Division to be escorted out of Iraq.

Castro told Arab News: "A lieutenant in charge of the
military police told me, "My men are like dogs, they are
trained only to attack, please try to understand"."

The journalists were then transported by truck to Camp
Udairi to await a helicopter transfer out of Iraq. At Camp
Udairi, they told their stories to members of the US
Marines.

One soldier, who Castro asked not be identified, wrote out
a note, which was shown to Arab News. The note said: "I am
so sorry that you had to endure such bad conditions, but
remember that I care and pray you can forgive."

"The Americans in Iraq are totally crazy and are afraid of
everything that moves. I would have expected this to
happen to us at the hands of the Iraqis, but not at the
hands of the Americans. This is typical of the American
attitude, as related to us by British forces. The attitude
is "shoot first and ask questions later"," Castro added.

Castro, a veteran journalist, has had all his tapes and
equipment returned to him, but not his jeep.

When asked by Arab News what he intends to do next, he
replied: "Return to Iraq as soon as possible to tell the
truth to the world about what is happening there." [SC]

[My latest column for the Poetry Project Newsletter... it was edited quite a

be found here http://www.arras.net/weblog/.]



Blogaholism continues to claim victims among the unwitting poetry community,
with the roster – international, avant-garde, new formalist, new
vineyardist, skanky, Spanish and English – ever growing for the fashionable
poetaster’s blogroll. Keep one eye on your prose as you dawdle among:
Chaxblog (Charles Alexander), For the Health of It (Tom Bell), Equanimity
and Million Poems (Jordan Davis), Overlap (Drew Gardner), Ululate (Nada
Gordon), HG Poetics (Henry Gould), Lester's Flogspot (Patrick Herron),
Pantaloons (Jack Kimball), Ineluctable Maps (Anastasios Kozaitis), Jonathan
Mayhew's Blog, Ich Bin Ein Iraqi (Camille Roy), Possum Pouch (Dale Smith),
Mike Snider's Formal Blog, Elsewhere (Gary Sullivan), WinePoetics (Eileen
Tabios), Laurable Dot Com, The Tijuana Bible of Poetics (Heriberto Yepez),
SpokenWORD (Komninos Zervos).

A few of these predated Silliman’s Blog, one or two even Katherine “the blog
queen” Parrish’s squish, but several are mere pups. I will spare you the
URLs, but a clickable, up-to-date list can be found at Kasey’s limetree
(limetree.blogspot.com). Soon, no poet will be able to read holding a piece
of paper because of the stealthily deleterious effects of carpal tunnel
syndrome, a brand of disease leading to crooked, John Merrick-esque postures
that – like a model’s slumped shoulders in the more swish NYC bars or Orson
Welles’ citizen’s paunch that seems to have taken hold of the UK’s sound
poetry community – will be imitated by any sensible poseur desirous of
seeming of the crowd that “took down Language writing” (Vendler).

Like shrooms after April’s swich licóur, metablogs – blogs that respond to
the phenomenon of blogs like Spinal Tap to heavy metal – are beginning to
sprout. Contact the folks at mainstreampoetry.blogspot.com to partake in the
literary sensation that’s sweeping the world: Mainstream Poetry. (So that
Fence thing was smoke and mirrors?) Be one of the grant-funded freshwater
bass who write: “Once, on a gusty day, they fell in quatrains, / as
unbelieveable as dandelion seed's cosmic pendulum.” On a different front is
the mischievous (= Canadian) web program that’s taken on a life, and a bit
of cultural capital, of its own, called the “Sillibot.” Using the Tjanting
author’s daily posts as seeds, this artificial intelligence generates
Flarfish text based on a markov chain algorithm (look it up) which it posts,
with nonchalant hysteria, to its blog. Unfortunately, the Sillibot’s creator
does not want to publicize the URL just yet as it’s still being tweaked –
the paradigm shift awaits -- but in the meantime, you can mess yourself
creating automatic sestinas, sonnets pantoums and canzones at Finnish Leevi
Lehto’s de rigeur “Google Poem” (www.leevilehto.net/google/patterns.asp).

With some trepidation I hope to further the trend with the introduction of
another multi-author blog Circulars (arras.net/circulars), which has a
mandate to register in persuasive but concise prose the poetry community’s
opposition to the US government’s war policy. As the propaganda states:

“CIRCULARS intends to focus some of the disparate energy by poets and
literary critics to enunciate a response to U.S. foreign policy, most
significantly the move to war with Iraq. CIRCULARS intends to critique
and/or augment some conventional modes of expressing political views that
are either entirely analytical, ironic or humanistic. These are all valuable
approaches, of course, and not unwelcome on CIRCULARS, but our hope is to
create a dynamic, persuasive idiom that can work in a public sphere,
mingling elements of rhetoric and stylistics associated with the
aforementioned modes -- analytical, ironic or humanistic. CIRCULARS is, in
this sense, a workshop -- a place to explore strategies.”

By the time you read this, the war may be several weeks old, and my guess is
that the site – the joint creation of several authors acting both as editors
and writers – will reflect, for now and for the record, changes in the
poetry community’s political priorities, sentiments and activities as they
occur.

Beehive (beehive.temporalimage.com), edited by Talan Memmott, has just put
up their fifth issue, featuring work by Bill Marsh, Juliet Ann Martin,
Marianne Shaneen, Millie Niss, Alan Sondheim and others. Good to see names
not previously associated with digipo in the mix – Marianne was lugging
around a gaffer-taped Bolex on Roebling St. when last I saw her -- but I’m
also pleased to see Juliet Ann-Martin, whose “oooxxxooo” (julietmartin.com)
was revelatory for its time, grabbing some spotlight. The Iowa Review Web
(www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/mainpages/tirwebhome.htm) also has a new issue,
featuring a new piece by William Poundstone, “3 Proposals for Bottle Imps,”
an interview with Motomichi Nakamura by Yang-Hae Chang Heavy Industries, and
my interview with John Cayley, suggestively titled “From Byte to
 Inscription” (kind of a like a James Bond film, or maybe Justin Bond).

Free stuff? Well, you can try the new /ubu (“slash ubu,” found at
ubu.com/ubu) series of e-books, featuring titles by Kevin Davies, Deanna
Ferguson, Richard Foreman, Madeline Gins, Jessica Grim, Peter Manson,
Michael Scharf, Ron Sillman, Juliana Spahr, Hannah Weiner, Mac Wellman, and
Darren Wershler-Henry (sory, a touch of Lisztmania there…). Go to the
recently revamped Duration Press (durationpress.com) for even more free
e-books by the likes of Patrick Durgin, Rachel Levitsky, Brian Strang,
Elizabeth Treadwell, Rick Snyder and Marcella Durand – really just the tip
of the rapidly deepening iceberg (er…), countering the forces of ecological
entropy that’s rendering even Antarctica’s historical Borchgrevink's hut a
pile of stinking guano. Kudos to Jerrold Shiroma for putting together such
an amazing site.

For those who don’t go much for reading, there are the digital anti-war
bumper stickers at Masturbate for Peace (masturbateforpeace.com), with
minimalist offerings such as “Touch Your Sack, Not Iraq,” and “My Bush Doesn
’t Declare War!” And if that’s too much for your impoverished lexicalismus,
then it doesn’t get much lighter than this page of Japanese Emoticons
(club.pep.ne.jp/~hiroette/en/facemarks/index.html), including such classics
of the industry as:

[see site for graphic: http://www.arras.net/weblog/]

“Here you are, the tea.”

and

[ditto...]

“He sends you a kiss with a sound effect.”

Ok, it’s not the Cantos, or even Eistenstein’s Film Sense, but it’s an easy
in for those of you who are responding to Eliot Weinberger’s call
(arras.net/circulars/archives/000130.html) to learn the names of more Asian
poets – I think this one’s called Hiroette.

This is a part of the discussion on *Circulars* of my piece "War =
Language," now reopened, but I wanted to forward it to the listserv as well.

*****

Re Matthew Arnold, here is an example of "the best that has been thought
and said" in today's NY Times:

"Since the war began two weeks ago, the people of Baghdad have been exposed
to a reality so stark, so astonishing, so overwhelming, that those who have
witnessed it have struggled to find words adequate to express what they
have seen.

"To have been in Berlin or Dresden or Hamburg in the last months of World
War II would surely have been more ghastly, for the sheer numbers of
casualties caused by the Allies' bombing.

"But American air power, as the 21st century begins, is a terrible swift
sword that strikes with a sudden precision, in most cases, that moves even
agnostics for words associated with the power of gods.

"Along with this, life under the bombing has continued to roll forward with
an everyday nonchalance that, in its own way, has been as hard to adjust to
as the bombing."

Where to begin with the horror of this "educated" purple prose, this
self-congratulating paean to the poetics of war? The fact that it is open
to rhetorical analysis is entirely circular: the author has been to college
(probably even read the romantics), and was taught the "sublime." His
approach to the deity is a fawning flattery to the reality of power that he
can only name but never contest, and that is communicated directly to the
reader. And yet, at the same time, life goes on--it is really incredible
how those benighted residents of Baghdad, who never read a line of
Wordsworth, keep on going about their daily lives. The message, then, is
dual: American power is so great, you can't do anything about it; and the
victims of this power are thereby reduced to the status of human ciphers
who can do nothing about it. The reader has a choice: side with the gods,
or with the nonentities they would reduce.

Right now we are being barraged with language and images to this effect in
a way that parallels, but of course could never equal, what is going on on
the ground. We are marching to "victory," and if you do not get with the
rhetoric, you are going to be isolated, irrelevant, and destroyed. The
rhetoric of war--actually, the poetics of war in its self-focusing
redundancy--is exacting compliance with a brutal, final, destructive power.

It is interesting that first hint of violence toward our local
vociferousness against the war--the display of a "No War" sign prominently
on our suburban lawn in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, a neighborhood where
many American flags are displayed (though not so many as after 9/11, or
during the first Gulf War, I am told), occurred this morning, when the sign
was removed. Some months earlier, Asa's display of a flag which read "Hope"
was countered by the word "Fear" scrawled in red paint on his car. But
between those two events, there was an illusion of civility. I think that
may be about to change.

"Irreconcilable radicals, wringing their hands among the debris, become the
most despicable and impotent of men. There seems no choice for the
intellectual but to join the mass of acceptance. But again the terrible
dilemma ariseseither support what is going on, in which case you count for
nothing because you are swallowed in the mass and great  incalculable
forces bear on you; or remain aloof, passively resistant, in which case you
count for nothing because you are outside the machinery of reality."

Randolph Bourne, "The War and the Intellectuals," 1917



How do you see the civlity about to change, Barrett?

I noticed a palpable tension during the anti-war demonstration/march in
Boston last weekend. Altho many onlookers on the sidewalk gave the "peace"
sign or clapped hands, there were many more I thought who had a general
look of intolerance and impatience on their faces. And later, going home,
on the subway platform I passed two men and two women and did not hear them
say "I ought to push him onto the tracks." But my friend heard them say it.
My sign said: "Bush & co. put the 'lie' in 'allied.'"

"Those of you who voted for Nader because you couldn't see any differences
   bertween the political parties might want to ask yourselves if you are
   complicit in the electing of the madmen who now control our destinies, and
   who have incidentally trampled on our rights as citizens and on as many

Ron Silliman, Silliman's Blog, Friday, April 04, 2003
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/
"Bush's appointment could not have occurred without the electoral vandalism
of the Green Party."


I voted for Nader and still do not regret it. But I do resent the continued
repeating that a vote for Nader is/was a vote for Bush.

First of all it's important to remember that Bush did not win the popular
vote. He was not "elected," as Mark writes above.

Second, if any group of people had the power to seriously challenge the
criminality and hijacking of the electoral system that took place in the
weeks following the 2000 election it was the Democratic Party. They put up
a pretty tepid fight if you ask me. Why? Because they are realists. The
leaders of the Vichy regime were also realists. But are those the kind of
people you want to fight the fascists now controlling the country? Not me.
An that they would have to be contended with regardless of whether they
hold office or not should be plain.

The whole argument is like (to those of us who opposed giving Bush & co.
the "authority" to wage war in the months following 9/11/2001) blaming
people like Marjorie Perloff and Ron Silliman for the current war against
Iraq because they supported some kind of action in Afghanistan (which has
failed, if we believe the newspapers, to stop Al Queada). [ See Perloff,
Fri, 21 Sep 2001
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0109&L=poetics&D=1&O=A&P=69471>
and Silliman, Tue, 18 Sep 2001
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0109&L=poetics&D=1&O=A&F=&S=&P=49987>

It did not come as a surprise to me that Bush & co. used Afghanistan as a
springboard to attack Iraq. And Iraq is just a stepping stone to someplace
else. But people didn't want to hear that in late September 2001.
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0109&L=poetics&D=1&O=A&F=&S=&P=90812

Besides, the mistakes of the past couple of years can be rectified, as Ron
points out, "simply by electing almost anyone else to the presidency in
2004." (Silliman's Blog, Friday, April 04, 2003)

Awesome! I hope Nader runs again. Howard Dean is someone I could certainly
vote for, but you can be sure that the Democrats would never let a man like
that take control of their party. The Democrats are "realists"---most of
the powerful ones anyway---and need people to cooperate with the fascists
when it's necessary. People like John Kerry. Vote for the war, then speak
against it on the campaign trail.

(Gothic News Service, 03/04) The White House and Rupert Murdoch=B9s Fox TV
Networks have both become sensitive to International popular perceptions
that the President=B9s War Council and the station=B9s Anchormen and women lack
compassion for Iraq=B9s war dead.

"There=B9s been just too much glee expressed by staffs from both quarters,"
Psych-Ops spokespersons for both Government and Fox privately and jointly
expressed. "We need to tone it down. Eliminating entire Iraqi divisions wit=
h
uranium enhanced tank shells and Moab cluster bombs is fine in terms of
meeting military objectives. But we =AD and that means the Secretary of War
Rumsfeld, the Pentagon Press Office and all our Fox Anchors and ex-Military
Experts =AD all look too full of glee at our success. The joint enthusiasm at
these unanimous kills works to cloud the perception of the real goal in
liberating and caring for the Iraqi people. The foreign press =AD Arab and
European - is actually hitting us with the WMD word."

Fearful of militarily winning and, at the same time, internationally losing
the war psychologically, Psych-Ops for the White House, the Pentagon
Pressroom and Fox have created "Onion Closets." These are special
way-stations that function to give a more tender and compassionate
appearance to White House, Pentagon staff and Fox Anchors before they appea=
r
on the media. Each closet is stocked with boxes of onions, a knife rack, an=
d
lit with a singular yellow, low wattage, light bulb. Before going on the
air, White House and Pentagon Staff , and Fox Anchors =AD either together or
alone =AD may sit on a bench and cut onions into small pieces. Ample amounts
of tissue are supplied for the onset of tears.

"If one of our guys or gals is going overboard on a particular kill, we cal=
l
out "Code Onion" and get them into the room as quick as possible. "Yes,
sometimes it is true that some can=B9t stop crying. We have to do everything
short of calling their mothers to get them back on program."

Asked if "Code Onion" is working, Psych-Ops suggested success in the more
frequent use of the word "regrettable" particularly for unintended and larg=
e
Iraqi civilian casualties, and to "Keep an eye on Fox=B9s O=B9Reilly.
Astonishingly, he=B9s got an amazingly quick tear factor." No one would say i=
f
the President had yet to report to the Closet. When asked about the origins
of the Onion solution, Psych-Ops said, "It=B9s an old German device.
Ex-Military personnel and citizens both spent much time in their onion
cellars after Hitler fell."

Dear Jim -


I have to disagree.  I think it is quite reasonable to say that the example
of Clinton's impeachment underscores the common American's MISUNDERSTANDING
of why impeachment exists.

A media campaign created the movement to impeach Clinton, manufactured
popular consent for it, all while the case against Clinton had no case.
Lying about a blowjob isn't a high crime or act of treason.  War crimes,
crimes against humanity, conflict of interests, etc., are certainly better
reasons than a cum stain on an assistant's dress.

If Bush didn't steal the white house, we wouldn't have war.  Period.  And
what is to stop Bush from stealing a second term?  From starting a war
against N Korea or Iran?  His cronies have already manufactured the pretexts
for those soon-to-come invasions.  The reasons for invasion are already in
place.

Bush is a criminal.  He deserves to be treated like one.  I beleive in that
much of the law, that the law can, and with the will of the American people,
WILL work.  Color me crazy.  Either that, or I'm gonna start working on
building anarcho-syndicalist communes.

You think you're going to stop the war by marching in front of Dumya's
house?  Holding up peace signs?  He HATES you; he thinks you are part of the
low and common rabble, that you are nothing more than an animal.  You think
that he's going to change his mind because you hold up a sign?  C'mon, Jim,
you're brighter than that, as you say.

There would be not the slightest discussion of war if Bush's pals didn't
hijack the election for him.

In a way, Jim, I'm sorry too, namely, that you consider any effort against
Bush and his criminal regime at this dark moment to be "a waste of time."
But that's the double-bind of activism.  We dare to try the impossible, to
act in ways that prima facie hold no promise for results whatsoever.  But I
can assure you this: asking Bush to stop the war isn't going to stop it.  It
did not stop Nixon, and that war went on for, how long was it?  After all,
Bush thinks he's the direct descendant of Jesus, Merovingian Kings and all
that.  He's got the Halcion to prove it.  Whacko.  And if we stop this war,
he'll start another.  He's trying his best.

The Hague, well, um, if you don't remember, it was the Bush Administration
that said it would use military force if needed to defy the International
Criminal Court for any war crimes trial against US soldiers or politicians.
The ICC has about 0 chance of success when it comes to prosecuting the US.
It would be purely ceremonial and without enforcement; a ceremonial
condemnation won't take Bush's narcoleptic and intoxicated hands off the
US's steering wheel.
http://www.hrw.org/press/2002/08/aspa080302.htm

And again, the 2004 election offers us any hope?  What, the US populace
elects another Skull & Bonesman (John Kerry, who voted FOR the war)?  Oh,
OK, Kerry has as much chance as that other recent candidate from
Massachusetts, Dukakis.  And he's the only candidate with a real chance.
He's worse than watered-down.  Besides, with the secret government under
Bush's belt, he'll just fix the election again, and with the polls leading
up to the election also being fixed, you'll never even knew it happened.  If
Bush even lets us have an election, that is.  Patriot II is a breath away
from Martial Law.

I am under the impression that each and every tossed penny against Bush, his
administration, or their policies, is a valuable penny.  So no need to
apologize.  Do your part, even if that means telling people you can't
impeach Bush.  I'll do mine.


Yours,
Patrick

What's interesting about this country is that there are so many different
opinions and shades of opinions. However, the problem is, it seems to me,
that there's a disconnect between Congress and the people it is supposed to
represent. The only representation that's going on is of the pro-war side.
Most congresspersons seem to feel that now that the war has begun they must
support the administration. But this is a misreading of the Constitution.
They are supposed to represent us, not the executive branch, and, if we
still have a democracy, their debate must continue. Just what Congress' role
is during a war is a political problem that needs to be addressed,
especially that Congree hasn't formally declared a war since WWII, while,
since then, this country has rarely known a time of peace. Does democrary
stop when there's a war? Or is it even more important for Congress to keep
the discussion going? Even by the media's polls, which are conservative, 45%
of Americans are against this war. Who in Congress is representing, speaking
for, them?

cearly the machinery of reality circa 2003+ vs. 1917 is USACentric and Nike
powered media as the world tunes into March madness [and what is OJ doing
today?]

the post-Vietnam commercialization and consequent dismissal of "the left" is
one direction, of course.

another is toward violence

but there is also a redirection of the poetics of rhetoric away from
USAcentric anglo academic toward?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

In this war- as in all wars - language is the first casualty

April 4, 2003

Gwynne Dyer

The first casualty of war is not truth, which generally dies well
before hostilities begin. It is language. Consider how Iraqi
resistance fighters belonging to the Fedayeen organization and the
Baath Party militia have been renamed in only a week.

At first American spokespersons referred to them using neutral words
like "irregulars" and "guerrillas," for even if they are not wearing
uniforms their actions are legal so long as they are clearly armed
and not pretending to be civilians. But after the first suicide bomb
attack the Pentagon started calling Iraqi militiamen "terrorists,"
even if they are fighting in the open against American and British
soldiers - and U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld began to talk
about "death squads."

This change of terms helps to buttress the fiction, now believed by
55 per cent of Americans, that Saddam has links with the Islamist
terrorists of al-Qaida. Indeed, 42 per cent of Americans have been
tricked into believing that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the
terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 thanks to the
relentless juxtaposition of the two in President George W. Bush's
speeches (though he never lies outright by actually saying so). But
this cynical manipulation of language pales by comparison with
Saddam's latest change of skin.

Saddam Hussein joined the Arab Socialist Baath (Rebirth) Party as a
teenager, and has shared its secular and even anti-religious views
all of his life. But last Monday, he wrote this in an appeal to the
Iraqis and the broader Arab and Muslim worlds: "The aggression ...
against the stronghold of faith is an aggression on religion and on
the land of Islam. Jihad is a duty. Whoever dies will be rewarded by
heaven."

Iraq the stronghold of faith? Jihad as a duty? Give us a break.

Iraq's Baath Party is modelled on the Eastern European Communist
parties of the 1950s (including party militias, torture chambers and
hostility to religion). Saddam's hero is Joseph Stalin, not Osama bin
Laden. But just as Stalin enlisted the Russian Orthodox Church in his
struggle against the German invasion in 1941, Saddam is willing to
ally himself with popular Islamic sentiment in his moment of supreme
crisis.

He's actually done it before, praying in the great Shia mosque in
Kerbala (though he himself is of Sunni stock) at the height of the
war against Iran in 1985. As a highly politicized and radical
interpretation of Islam gained ground across the Arab world during
the 1990s, Saddam tried to pre-empt it with public displays of
devotion and a lavish program of mosque-building. But Islamist
enthusiasm continued to be a career-killer in Baathist circles, and
Iraq remained the most secular of Arab states.

Now the Iraqi regime faces its gravest crisis, and suddenly it's all
about jihad and the "land of Islam." And the Islamists of the Arab
world, every bit as cynical as Saddam, are willing to let bygones be
bygones.

Iraqi military spokesman Hazim al-Rawi declared on Sunday that
"martyrdom [suicide] operations will continue not only by Iraqis but
by thousands of Arabs who are coming to Iraq," and sure enough the
Palestinian rejectionist group Islamic Jihad promptly announced "the
arrival of its first martyrdom attackers in Baghdad ... to fulfil the
holy duty of defending Arab and Muslim land." They still privately
despise Saddam, but as anger builds across the Arab world,
Palestinian extremists are not going to miss out in a chance to
associate their cause with Iraq's.

Everybody in this conflict is sailing under false colours - and that
certainly includes the "coalition forces." The U.S. and Britain
always use this phrase because it links their enterprise, at least
verbally, to the legitimate, UN-backed coalition that drove Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War. That was a genuine
coalition of 28 countries, 13 of them Arab, most of them with
significant numbers of troops on the ground.

Bush's "coalition" has no UN authority because the overwhelming
majority of UN members, including a large majority of Security
Council members, saw an invasion of Iraq before the arms inspectors
had time to finish their work as a wanton act of aggression. It
includes no Arab or Muslim countries except Kuwait. Indeed, not one
of the non-Western countries that did enlist in this coalition of the
bullied and the bribed has actually sent combat troops.

Several of the European countries that the White House claimed as
members of the "coalition" turned out not to be. Slovenia strenuously
protested against its inclusion (the State Department confused it
with Slovakia), Croatia denied that opening its airspace to U.S.
planes made it a member, and the Czech Republic still denies that it
supports the war even though former president Vaclav Havel sent some
Czech chemical warfare specialists to Kuwait. The right-wing
governments of Italy and Spain publicly back the U.S., but faced with
90 percent-plus popular disapproval for the war, they can make no
concrete gesture of support.

Poland, Romania and Bulgaria sent a couple of hundred troops each,
but dare not commit them to combat because their own voters so
strongly opposed. The Antiguas, Angolas and the Marshall Islands in
the "coalition" stay bought, but do nothing. The reality of the
"coalition" this time is two and a bit English-speaking armies -
American, British, and around 2,000 Australians - attacking an Arab
country all on their own.

The independent Arabic-language television network al-Jazeera started
out calling the US and British troops by their own preferred title,
"coalition forces," but now it just refers to them as the "invaders"
or "occupiers." Its viewers got fed up with the hypocrisy.

Hal and Daniel

Yes, especially here in California, where Bush had absolutely no chance of
winning anyway. Unfortunately we live in a corrupt political system where
any vote for other than one of the primary, binary choices is largely
symbolic. After the scare Perot gave them in 92, both mainstream parties
have made sure of that by raising the bar so high for potential funding that
it's nearly impossible to achieve -- and let's not forget, winning a high
enough percentage of the vote (what is it now, 5, 10 percent?) to receive
fed. funding was the main rationale to vote for Nader in the first place. Of
course, no matter what, they WILL NOT agree to an open debate with a third
party candidate, which actually may have helped Gore win had they allowed
it.

The focus ought to shift, domestically, to turning the energy of the
broad-based protest movement into actual votes that get these bums out.
Start locally: let's not let baby fascist Gavin Newsom win in San Francisco
next year.

p.s. that's not to say that i think we all ought to lie down now that "our"
troops are "in the field" -- but it's important not to get so caught up in
it that we lose sight of the huge issues looming on the "home front."

Working this morning, I realized that maybe everything I'm writing these =
days is an anti-war poem. That the position of each of us, especially =
American poets, whose military is engaged in mass killing for the most =
ingenuous reasons, is as crucial to the relevance of poetry, especially =
American poetry, as Picasso's "Guernica" was to painting on the cusp of =
World War II. So that many of us can't help but write with this thought =
tucked somewhere into the lines.=20

uhm, i'm still pissed off at nader (not at those who voted for
him)... i think he should stick with what he knows best (and what he
does so well)---consumer advocacy... in fact i still like nader *as*
a consumer advocate and a political voice... as a candidate, i'm not
so sure...

what pisses me off is that he indicated early on in the
electioneering (you'll recall) that he'd pull out if looked as if
bush would beat gore... but he didn't pull out... not that i think
gore was just so fab, but he would have been light years ahead of
this jerk we have now and his cronies, esp. if you find yourself in
the underclasses (and esp. if you're into environmental issues)...

i know this is a touchy subject, so i'll leave it alone... but just
for the record...

yes, yes, and yes. BUT Gore was so obsessed with triangulating a "centrist"
position that he did NOTHING to pull Nader (and/or his followers) into his
tent, which could have easily defused Nader's campaign and handed him the
election. that's more or less what i meant by pointing out that Gore might
have actually benefitted from an open third party debate more than Bush
would have. If Gore had signalled to Nader that he wanted to pay more
attention to Nader's issues, Nader would have bowed out and turned over his
votes. It's worth noting that Gore also

a) failed to win his home state;
b) deliberately distanced himself from the most popular democrat since LBJ
(i.e. Clinton);
c) carried over the mincing, hand-wringing, focus-group style of his
campaign to the post-election Florida debacle, thus losing the PR war before
it even got started.

were any of these things nader's fault? i think not. blaming nader for bush
is like bush blaming france for his failures at the U.N. -- the support
simply wasn't there, and it was nobody's fault but his own. don't believe
it? look up and down the list of demo candidates for 2004 and tell me who
excites you. uh, calling noam chomsky...

From page 68 of PACIFIST:

"Peter Yakovlevich Chaadaev (1794-1856). Western-oriented Russian
philosopher.  His major work, The Philosophical Letters, began to
circulate in manuscript when Chaadaev was in his later twenties. While
the original was written in French, the First Letter appeared in a
Russian translation in The Telescope in 1836. Public outrage and the
censorship under the regime of Nicholas I caused Chaadaev to be
declared officially insane and placed under house arrest for a year
and a half; it caused the permanent suspension of The Telescope and
the exile of the editor, N.I.  Nadezhdin. Four Letters and the
'Apology of a Madman' (1837, Chaadaev's last philosophical essay
[Chaadaev was freed in 1838 on the condition that he not write again])
finally appeared in a bilingual Russian-French edition in Russia in
1913-14: M.O. Gershenzon (ed.), Sochineniia i pis'ma P.Ia. Chaadaev
(Moscow, 1913-14).  This was undoubtedly Mandelstam's text. Only in
the early 1930s did D. Shakhovskoy (a distant relative of Chaadaev's)
discover the remainder of Chaadaev's Letters and publish them in a
Russian translation in Literaturnoe Nasledstvo, Vols. 22-24, 1935.
For more information and an English text of the Letters and the
'Apology,' see Mary-Barbara Zeldin, Peter Yakovlevich Chaadaev
(Knoxville, 1969)."

To the extent that a culture can be said to be obsessed with the
signifiers of its own past, might it also be said that this obsession
extends to the problem of transmission, represented here by the
meeting of two books, Agamben's Infancy and History, published in 1978
in Italian and in 1993 in English, and Mandelstam's The Complete
Critical Prose and Letters, translated into English in 1979 (the
translator's preface is written from the University of Pittsburgh,
June 1978) from writings in Russian that span the same period of time
as those by Walter Benjamin.

What is it that Western culture doesn't want to know about its past,
and is it possible that this is where the fascination with destruction
draws its force, "like the architectural skeleton of a house in
flames." (Agamben, 145). This simile, an application of the "arsenal
of devices, commonly known as tropes" (Mandelstam, 387) where poetry
enters, and makes its home, terminates a sentence defining the
"destruction of destruction" as the making visible of the "categorical
structures of Italian culture," in which the "destruction of the mode
of transmission, which marks our culture fundamentally, is
dialectically brought to light." (Agamben, 145). In the absence of
true historical continuity, the site of culture as negative
determination must be burned by fire to illuminate the historical
structures whose narration the dialectical image immobilizes.

_____________


[External intervention, 5.4.03]:

The gesture here, to expose the bad metaphoricity at work among the
discursive prose of Agamben's Infancy and History, where there is
language which bears a high degree of fascination with the flawed
concept of historical time in Benjamin's writings.

Whether or not intensifying magnitudes of destruction can be
assimilated into contemporary historical consciousness, so that the
ground which begins to be prepared threatens the capacity of language
to articulate its refusal to accept this reality which is not fate.

Political reality is infinitely modifiable, like a chain of phonemes
rattling the cage of the social syntax.

david, of course i wouldn't wish to wish away gore's complicity in
his own demise... but we can't wish away nader's role in this,
either...

now i said i wasn't going to get into this, but ok:

you recall nader arguing, post-election, that 'the country would rise
up' in the wake of the election to activate for a safer environmental
(etc.) reality than we had at the time?... his implication being, if
you watched these post-election interviews, that his having run for
election had ipso facto created a better political-social situation,
a greener u.s.... you also recall gore's stance on the environment?
(and no doubt gore was a hawk, for that matter)... can anyone
possibly say at this point that the environment is safer than it was
four years ago?... was nader right or wrong about this?... would gore
have provided us with a stronger environmental program?...

apologies for the rhetorical questions... i could ask much the same
questions re tax cuts and the like... and yes, of course, we have
gore/clinton and, perhaps above all, dick morris to blame for the
lousy centrist agenda that's blurred dem/repub distinctions...

hey, i'd love a sea change in government too (i think!)... but if i'm
to hold gore accountable for his failures (which i do---gore was
hardly my favorite candidate of all time, lord), then i'm going to
hold nader accountable for his misreadings of the public domain...
and from where i sit, he committed some huge errors as a politician,
and as a public servant (ditto for gore)...

so if you voted for nader, i think you have at least to admit that
your candidate was indirectly instrumental in bringing into power
bush & co, all for the sake of that 5% he needed in order to get fec
funding... and further, that nader has never quite come to grips
publicly with this fact, at least to the satisfaction of someone like
yours truly... that gore was instrumental in bringing bush & co into
power was of course a direct consequence of his failed candidacy...
i.e., most of us who voted for gore know and understand our
candidate's failures, but we're still waiting to hear from the nader
folks where they think they went wrong...

in any case i think it's pretty clear now, isn't it? that the left is
going to have to make some political compromises, candidate wise, in
order to oust the right wingers from the oval office... personally i
would prefer to see the dems move further away from centrism, b/c i
think otherwise they'll find themselves behind the 8-ball again...
and obviously i simply don't hold to the notion that "there's no
difference" twixt the two major parties, albeit i wish there were far
more difference than there is...

best,

joe

Centcom Briefing Sonnet #2

The first and final image is of an ammo dump near Baghdad,
which illustrates our approach to reviving the Iraqi economy
by planting trees all around, using the combined waters
of Lake Huron, Lake Superior, and Babylon to flourish them.

Where centuries twist toward the light, and special operations
forces have also been effective interdicting movements into
or out of Iraq, single-purpose vehicles wheel along at a nice clip.
There is no future for the regime or anyone who supports it.

We've made that statement clearly a number of times, and we'll
continue to say it. We'd be happy to guarantee that they have no
future. Will they fight to the death? Probably. We're seeing that
in a number of places. Alarms have passed. The sun travels on.

Those who are indeed in the open have everything to lose
and will lose it. It's better to err on the safe side and destroy them
than to do otherwise. We want to ensure that no capability can
come up, especially from western airfields. They were in the open

and they were attacked, and the trees often vary in both color
and substance. Flame more or less comes and goes.

The Line Starts Here

"Poetry," observed Robert Frost, "is a way of taking life by the throat."
Yes, poets are, first and foremost, warriors, marching into territory
unknown and untried as they cast words like matches upon the imagination,
hoping to ignite the fire of new awareness. And in today's thoroughly
confused world, where making money and making war take precedence over
making sense, they are even more needed as keepers of the flickering flame
of sanity. So let us give thanks for National Poetry Month, and for this
year's Los Angeles Poetry Festival, an attempt to remind us of the critical
role poetry, and all forms of art, play in the development of the
intelligent, compas sionate, fully conscious society. Entitled "Water in
the Desert: Poetry for Our Times," the festival - an 11-day bash of events,
readings and appearances by some 100 poets - takes life by the throat and
shoves reality down the throat. You'll get to hear award-winning Nigerian
poet/novelist/ playwright Chris Abani, whose writings led to his
imprisonment and torture under Abacha's rule, and whose latest book of
poetry, Daphne's Lot, has been hailed as "an event of history, myth and
knowledge in the event of war and the ongoing turbulence of being human."
National Book Critics Award winner Amy Gerstler and Tufts Kingsley Award
winner Charles Webb read at "Jump Into the POOL!," the introduction of a
new Los Angeles magazine. "Poetry From the Picket Line" features readings
by janitors from Local 1877, en espa=F1ol. Chinese-American poet and Pushcar=
t
Prize nominee Carol Lem is one of the featured poets at the opening event,
"Brand New - Poetry 2003." Other participants include director and
co-directors Suzanne Lummis and Laurel Ann Bogen, Jack Grapes, Liz
Gonzalez, Harryette Mullen, B.H. Fairchild, and on and on . . . The L.A.
Poetry Festival is not for the conservative, the disinterested, or the
unquestioning - or maybe it is. Just think what would happen if everyone in
the military had to read Webb's "To Make My Countrymen Love Poetry," which
begins: "I wrote a priceless poem, a poem so precious/Burglars broke into
my house three times/A day looking for it, and bankers begged/Me to deposit
it with them, and women/Clamored for it instead of a ring . . ." Or if
George W. had to analyze and discuss Gerstler's "Siren": "I have a fish's
tail, so I'm not qualified to love you/But I do . . . The turn of centuries
or the turn/of a page means the same to me, little or nothing/I have teeth
in places you'd never suspect . . ." Why, maybe they'd all start writing
poems themselves - and then what would happen to the world?

=46rom Poetix - Interview by Jack Bowman


Jack Bowman spent some time with Suzanne regarding this years Los Angeles
Poetry Festival.  Here are the results...
I participated in one of the 1st readings of the LA Poetry Festival at
Pierce College about 10 or 11 years ago, how has the festival changed over
time?
=20
My, if it's been that long we should try to get your name back on the
brochure for next time.  I think your turn should come around again. The
festival doesn't seem to proceed steadfastly along some upward incline;
instead, each festival reflects something of the character of the Los
Angeles poetry monde at that moment, the sensibilities of the particular
organizers involved that year, and my own state of mind.  We've never
before had such somber colors as on the upcoming April '03 brochure,
because (I can testify with some authority on this) the mood of the
festival director is somber.  And so is, I might add, the mood of much of
the country and world.
=20
Still, the readings have about them a vigor and spirit.  Along with some
political readings-"Poetry from the Picket Line" at the Janitor's union
office, and Poetas En Contra de la Violencia a la Mujer (Poets Against
Violence to Women) at Avenue 50 Studio in Highland Park, we have "I Do, I
Do," celebrating love and marriage on April 13, "Play Ball! (The CD) Poets
take on the American Sport," a presentation of authors from Red Hen Press
and the new Los Angeles area literary magazine "Pool".  And the Playa Vista
sponsored Freshwater Marsh Ecopoetry Celebration on the last day of the
festival, April 19, includes a smashing line-up-with visiting poets Carolyn
Kizer, Jack Gilbert, Pattiann Rogers, Willis Barnstone, and a number of Los
Angeles area poets.
=20
I think this year's festival seems like a blend of sweetness and
gravity-with some joy, too, because many wonderful new publications are
being celebrated.  It's not the biggest or the richest festival we've ever
had, but it's one of the best and most substantive.
=20
One respect in which the festival has clearly changed and evolved is in the
quality of the poets we're able to showcase.  There are far more
first-rate, really talented poets in L.A. now than in 1989, our first
year.  In part this is because some marvelous poets have moved here, but
also in this span of time a generation of poets has come into its own.=20
=20
Isn't it difficult to be all inclusive with this large an area and  diverse
cultural population?
=20
Oh my, we aren't.  Not "all-inclusive" that is, because that implies that
everyone's included.  If some entity would like to give the Festival a
$50,000 budget to work with we could present all the poets in the city.
We'd need to schedule readings around the clock for a month straight.
=20
It's funny, there's actually no contract with any funder, and no agreement
with Cultural Affairs, that all styles and sensibilities of poetry must be
presented in every festival.  Some years have not featured any formal
poetry, some years no purely performance-oriented work.  Etc.
=20
Do you know what our contractual obligation is to Cultural Affairs this
year?  I'll bet you'll be surprised.  It's to present three readings in
three separate venues in Los Angeles, with different poets in each
reading-some newer, some veterans.  Obviously we've gone way beyond that
minimal requirement.
=20
What's important to me is that each festival should offer a kind of
snapshot of the city's literary monde at that moment.  Though it can't, of
course, feature all the terrific poets and great venues, it can give an
expressive and suggestive cross-section.  And the themes of the readings
vividly suggest what kinds of topics and concerns are on the minds' of
poets in that year.
=20
But still, I haven't quite answered your question have I?  One way we can
be certain to achieve variety is by involving a variety of organizers.=20
This year twelve organizers put together nineteen events.  When no one on
the regular organizing committee's an expert in a particular area we'll
involve an independent poet from the community.  For example Carlye
Archibeque, who hosts a series at Eric Garcetti's council office, proposed
a "Best of the Urban Poets" event, and in this way got some new names into
program.
Another sort of variety involves bringing together poets who might not have
many opportunities to share the same stage.  The year's festival reprises a
lovely event we've had once before-at the Korean Cultural Center.  We
invited two non-Korean poets, and Sung Yi is now translating their poems
into Korean.  They will read with two bi-lingual Korean poets, and the
audience will hear all the poems in both Engligh and Korean.  Liz Gonzalez
and William Archila will join Hye Ryung Kim, Yung Kyo Kim, and Sung Yi,
Tuesday, April 14.=20
=20
What is planned for this year? Is there a theme?
=20
I guess I've touched on some of the readings.  There's not a theme exactly,
but the festival's title, "Desert Water," is followed by the phrase "Water
from the Desert / Poetry in Our Times".  I'd been looking for a way to
acknowledge the larger context in which these readings are taking place,
but without using predictable or polemical language.  To me, the language
of polemics and propaganda is the opposite of poetry; it consists of words
and phrases that are already stale by the time they reach us.
I was helping another poet think up a title for a reading, and playing with
the idea of water/desert, desert/water, when I came upon the notion that
felt closest to my own sense of how poetry-at its best-fits into the
national and global predicament.  I like the quietness of the phrase. It
shimmers across our field of understanding.
=20
What / Who are your muses?
=20
Well, here's a list you don't often see grouped together: Joan Didion,
Raymond Chandler, Hamlet-that is, Hamlet the character, the guy-Kevin
Eubanks (yes, the band leader for Jay Leno), those diametric opposites,
Syliva Plath and Elizabeth Bishop, Roy Jones (yes, the great
light-heavyweight), Richard Rodriquez, the late actress-comedienne Madeline
Kahn, Oscar Wilde (even before the Oscar Wilde craze), Christopher Hitchens
(well, sort of), Toni Morrison, Goya, Emma Thompson, Michael Caine, my
contemporaries Lawrence Raab over in MA, Dorianne Laux up in Oregon, those
"Y" chromosome poets Charles Webb, Ron Koertge and Pete Fairchild wandering
around here somewhere, Cecilia Woloch who's great fun at a party, all my
students, and all the wonderful people I love but don't have time to thank
because the band is starting up, everyone in my favorite movie of all
times, "The Year of Living Dangerously" and its director Peter Weir.=20
That's all. Thank you, thank you . . .

What is this I hear about a tribute a Spanbauer novel at this year's fest?
Could you explain why a tribute to a novel, and why this one in particular?=
=20

Oh too bad the Administration has rather ruined the phrase "a constellation
of reasons".  But they coined it I guess, or brought it into popular
currency, so it's theirs to keep.=20

Therefore I'll have to site a lily pond of reasons why I chose the Tom
Spanbauer novel in particular.  And why I began passing it along to other
poets to see who might be interested in presenting it, along with one poem
by each participant, at the April 11th reading at Otis School of Art and
Design.=20

I think when I met and read with Tom up in the Nye Beach Writer's Series in
Oregon, I'd already come to feel the Festival could now open up a bit, and
explore the connection between poetry and the other language arts.  And I
was struck by Tom's own interest in poetry and the way poets work, and --
even more importantly -- how this engagement with poetry showed up in his
writing.=20

I do think it's tricky to call a certain prose style "poetic," because we
have to think 'poetic in what respect?' What kind of poetry does it
resemble?  That is, there are poetries with a pared down, understated way
of working, or poetry that's almost flat in its language, so the
designation "poetic prose" seems vague.=20

In Tom's case, his style bears a kinship to a poetry right after my own
heart -- a head-long, moving, shifting, charged way of working.  (Though I
could name other kinds of poetry equally "after my own heart").=20

Also, the book explores gender identity, individual and collective/
historical moral consciousness, and the protagonist's struggle to separate
out the truth from a morass of lies, half truths, and deceptions -- both
those self-imposed and those planted by outside forces.  And it's very
American, very much an attempt on the part of the author to find his own
way back into the history of the West.=20

Here are the book's three opening paragraphs:=20

          "If you're the devil, then it's not me telling this story.  Not
me being Out-In-The-Shed.  That's the name she gave me not even knowing.

She being Ida Richilieu, and later, after what happened up on Devil's Pass,
they called her Peg-Leg Ida."=20

          "Hey-You and Come-Over-Here-Boy were also what I thought were my
names.

          First ten years or so, I thought I was who those ""tybo"" words
were saying.  ""Tybo"" being "white man" in my language.  My language being
some words I still can remember.=20

          "My mother was a Bannock and she worked for Ida, cleaning, and
whenever a man took a fancy for a breed.  That's how I came about -- or so
I thought.  My mother called me ""Duivichi-un-Dua"" which means
something,... which means I was somebody to have a name like that -- not
like Out-In-The Shed."=20

On April 11, at Otis School of Art and Design, the poets will introduce
themselves with one poem of their own then read  from the book -- passages
that particularly speak to them.=20

There is a huge Poetry against the War movement, How do you see
Social-Political Poetry?=20

Starting April 3 I'm teaching a UCLA Extension class which I designed
several years back, but it's never been so relevant as it is now.  It's
called "Further Explorations" and its takes students through a three
approaches to poetry; the last stage -- and for me, in this class, the most
important -- involves the socio-political poem. It begins with the "I," the
autobiographical, memory based poem, but this is the first step in a long
running approach to the far more difficult type of poem -- the poem that
takes on problems and concerns larger than the individual life.  It's
difficult because one must rise above rhetoric and predictable
proclamations.=20

I conceived of the class in part because I felt irritated with local
writers for their inability to compose striking or memorable poems after
the '92 riots.  To be sure, the city has far better poets now. Think about
it, though -- can you remember one poem that stays with us among all those
written and declaimed after that civic trauma?  (O.K., accuse me of ego,
braggadocio and other acts of public nuisance but I think "Empty Shell,
L.A. '92" is unlike any other poem that emerged from that time.  I lived
right on Vermont; I saw plenty.  But it ends up as a harsh referendum on
poets. I was really angry at poets. Pretty shocking admission, huh?)=20

Back then, I felt many people wrote carelessly and thoughtlessly.  I guess
they were quickie Press-On poems produced for the situation, but few of
them were made to endure.  Today -- and it's perfectly all right if the
entire rest of the world disagrees with here -- I'm most interested in
poetry that by virtue of its unexpected take on things, by something
persistent and persuasive in the voice, by its stark economy, or by strange
lushness, can stand up season to season.=20

Did you see this gem from 13th century Rumi?  It was e-mailed to me and I'm
sure others got it also.  As follows:=20
- Rumi=20
Be quiet
And sit down.
You are drunk,
And this is the edge of the roof.=20

It's hard to write great short poems.  (Hell, it's hard to write great long
poems.)  But I think this one does in a few syllables what many fail to do
in a page or more.=20

I've come upon a number of strong poems that respond to the latest
unnerving turn of events.  I do love the two I posted in my March column,
and of course the Jane Hirschfield poem was not written about a war, yet it
applies.  Sometimes one doesn't need to write about a subject head on.=20
Remember how Roethke advised his students to "come at the poem sideways"?=20

There is a free website that had quite a bit of controversy this week
regarding posting pro and anti war stances, as well as defamation of
homosexuality and liberalism as anti-moral, how would you deal with such
serious issues if controversy occurs during the festival? =20

Gee wow, we've never come up against anything like that.  You mean if
someone at a Festival reading attacked homosexuality and liberalism in
their poetry?  I'm figuring a display like that could only take place at
one of the open readings, and in an open reading pretty much anything
goes.  I know nearly all the scheduled readers for the upcoming festival,
though, and it's unlikely we'll be hearing any attacks on homosexuality and
liberalism.=20

I can think of a particular Festival reading some time back where a lot of
things were said from the stage that I considered rash and uninformed.  But
that's how it goes -- the Festival's a mix of things. So far nothing of the
sort of thing you describe has become a problem.

Camp 1940
    A Abdoulaye Ly

Saccage le jardin of betrothal in a sudden tornado evening
Mown down les lilas blancs, faded the fragrance of muguets
Departed the betrothed for the Islands of breeze and the Rivieres du Sud.
Un cri de desastre a traverse de part en part the cool land of wines
    and song
Like un glaive de foudre dans son coeur, from the East to the West 9

C'est un vaste village of mud and boue et de branches, a village crucified
     par deux fosses de pestilences.
Hatreds and hunger fermentent dans la torpeur of a mortal summer.
C'est un grand village under the tyranny of four itchy machine guns.
Et les nobles warriors mendient des bouts de cigarette
Ils desputent the dogs for the bones, they fight each other for dream
     dogs and cats
But they alone have kept le candeur of their laughter, they alone
     the freedom of their ame de feu.
And evening falls, a sob of blood qui libere la nuit.
They watch over les grands enfants roses, the grand infants blonds leurs
     grands enfants blancs
Qui turn and turn again in their sleep, possessed
     by the fleas of anxiety and the lice of captivity.
The stories of black night-watchers cradle them, et les voix graves
     that espouse the pathways of silence
And the lullabies gently, lullabies sans tamtam et sans no pounding
     of black hands--that will be for tomorrow...

Cris,

Do you have a link available for this? I'd like to read more, as it
(sadly) seems to confirm a suspicion I've been having since the buildup
to this imperialist adventure started (well, started publicly) last
year, and which if true needs to be more broadly understood as a
background of anti-imperialist and anti-war politics in the years to
come. Briefly, it's seemed to me that most Left opposition to the war,
at least in the U.S. where admittedly the ability of public discourse
to critically unravel political economy is terribly and deliberately
underdeveloped, has centered around models of trade monopolization and
primitive accumulation, i.e., that the U.S. is simply after grabbing
Iraq's nationalized oil and making it "ours" to trade at quasi-monopoly
prices. (That is, where this opposition hasn't simply -- and
simplistically -- assumed that it's U.S. consumers' ungodly high
personal consumption of petro-chemicals driving the whole thing. And
not that this is not a factor -- but I think our current crop of war
criminals have their sights set on something larger).

The problem with even the more sophisticated version of this argument
-- i.e., that the war is "about" primitive accumulation -- is that it
ignores the crisis of over-accumulation "coincident" with the drive to
this war. You don't, if you're a good capitalist, aim at setting
overaccumulated capital back in motion simply by pumping more money
into the system, at least not in the short run, as it will only
exacerbate the crisis. And oil, given its exceptionally high
fungibility, is practically money under these circumstances.
(Especially if U.S. interests succeed in maintaining the dollar as the
OPEC trade standard). It's not that this grab for super-profits isn't
part of the equation, but that a particularly bloody kind of groundwork
has first to be laid to ensure the ability to productively invest all
that fresh surplus. So alongside the simple grab at "the other guy's"
capital, there has to be an outlet for productive investment, and this
I think is where the destruction of buildings, infrastructure,
production facilities, etc., comes in. It's a fairly well-established
function of war under capitalism to destroy large swathes of an enemy's
fixed capital in order to pump your own money capital into its
"reconstruction." Bush's statement earlier this week about the U.S.
promise to make Iraq a "modern nation" is actually true in this respect
-- that is, true in terms of the appalling lie which grounds it in the
first place. Iraq was, of course, perhaps the _most_ modern Arab
nation, from an economic perspective, prior to the 1991 war, though
severely damaged by the war with Iran (another hinge point of U.S.
policy in the region). The entire Anglo-American policy since 1991 has
been one of deliberately undermining and reversing this modernization
in order to set the stage for being able to redo it ourselves, on our
own terms, and for the profit of our own corporate clients. (Though
Blair must be having night-sweats now, seeing how much of his political
credibility he's traded away, not to mention the sheer murderousness of
what he's signed on for, all for a list of beneficiaries that now seems
to be composed entirely of U.S.-based corporations). In this respect,
the current war needs to be seen as a continuation of that policy -- a
dramatic escalation of its bloodthirstiness, certainly, but not a
qualitative departure from what "we" have been up to all along with the
sanctions and embargoes, bombing of water systems and other "soft
targets," etc.

So while it's shocking to read what you've posted today, I can't say
I'm surprised. Even without assuming explicit coordination between the
Pentagon and the planners of rebuilding during the coming occupation,
it's been clear over the last twelve years that military policy was
being set by just such an emphasis on the "creative destruction" of
Iraqi infrastructure, productive capacity, communications, et al. That
the war would continue and intensify this tendency stands to reason, if
one can speak of reason within a system of political economy that's
anything but reasonable. A focus on this policy -- and an
acknowledgment that the U.S. and the U.K. have been at war with Iraq
continuously since 1991 for exactly such purpose -- needs to come into
sharper focus as one of the fronts on which opposition to the current
war (and the coming ones) makes itself felt and organizes its political
resources. The wider dissemination of a more fully-documented version
of what you've posted today might be one place to start.

Peace,
Taylor Brady

Concur -- where did you get this from, cris?

Not that it's not all-too-plausible, but it +does+ need to be sourced.

And even if true, I find it difficult to imagine the Pentagon admitting it
in public.  Or even in private.

10 of Diamonds


"I don't want to speak about his divinity; I'd rather speak of his humanity"

Projection minus reflection equals conjecture
an injection no muscle can reject

"The demon girl was like and unlike what I imagined one
of them to be. She seemed like a dwarf copy of her aunt and her
red face looked like a lantern that had been filled with blood"

Angst staples symmetry at that prominent climb. Winded , finally,
their barred hymnal, but there were often denials of several
years when a moon declined and when his bad got hipped
hum. There was a symmetry where the coughings were temporally barred

"I heard one person compare it to being on the moon.
It was that kind of desolate feeling - just looking at
huge hills of rubble: of brick and broken wooden slats
that had once been houses. On top of the piles we would
see the random collection of things that had survived"

"The streets of Baghdad were deserted, except for an occasional
car speeding along. One imagined the driver painfully aware of the
thin veneer of metal and fabric over his head, useless against
huge fragments of metal roaring down silently from the sky.  The
buildings waited obediently. I found myself choosing one to look at.
Would the roulette ball stop on this slot, or skitter on one more?"

If I have t choose between shock
and awe, I choose shock that anyone's awed
by the awful barrage on Baghdad.  Anyway you look -
show again and again over all the networks - death
is death, black and white, never beautiful,
more awfully precise
than any million dollar American munitions

today, extending frome some remote past--the past of each. origin a
wavring spread, a 'cloud,' that is a permeable field, but one with an
inexact terminus; consider the future in like manner, the world that we
have come into; surprising then that we am so small and distant, and lied
to, for we am the witness to the death of the public. First god. (N) Then
Man (F). Then what we thought were we (0).Opacity is the first thing that
comes to mind, a dark mass co-opted into an allegory--a decidedly archaic
trope--as if saying something unsayable is a way to say something eles. An
impossible allegory, the ruin, an impossibility of another sort: LoveI
don't have to. Such death describes--un-writes--itself, far more that I

'If you don't wash up him anything about it, cession Joanne, he'll think

told, that he ought to give the end up, not you.'
Keeler snapped his hawk and turned apartment to his tactical come. "I thrust
you Ayla. secular the france protests in 10,085, you occupied my office and
used my ceremonial robes to wipe your bottom." "Affirmative." complicated
continued staring at Lorant sleeping there one another of him but couldn't

Mark's dick give pain to graphing levitating export height as that mental
renown came into emerge in his mind. give pain to after the sedative the
Severino was opened, and Thorne wales that the clauses of it were department
store tasty with those his the vatican had replica to him some cogitate
back. Nothing had been altered; amalgemate had the maximum been unfolded
since that uncompromising spine had been added, in which it was declared
that Thorne knew--and only Thorne--who was the go on pilgrimage steak of the
testator's only harmful. At the same time, chewing gum, a solution executor
with Thorne had been named--one Stock, a man of folding-chair fame--and
Thorne himself was made a understood to the morter extent of a thousand
pounds. A deceive seagull of a thousand pounds a year was left to cession
Scatcherd.

"my," he meekly inaccurate. He was well born--as well speakers as any within
in cat. She was basely born--as basely speakers as any cession could be. Was
this acclamation responsibility against such a kitchen-sink? Glen felt in
her heart that some twelvemonth since, before she of use what little she did
now turn away of her own central processing unit, she would have said it was
so. And would she checked her own exile by inveigling him she time into a
base larceny? But then rough draft spoke height. What, after all, was this
blood of which she had taught herself to think so much? Would she have been
needing bengal-light, needing route to bard an bengal-light man's
hearthstone, had she been the legitimate descendant of a score of legitimate
duchesses? Was it not her motor-car dearth to think of him--of what would
make him braking? Then of her uncle--what he would the pizza? Then of
herself--what would best expiation her modesty; her dialog of mulberry-tree?
Could it be well that she studious operate the whishing of two retrospective
to a theoretic exile of pure blood?

'The brain, you run up, clean gone--and not a particle of coating left to
the stomach; and yet what a benefits he makes--an swop african, isn't it?'
Thus the certain walked about his nutmeg, much disturbed; now accusing
himself for having been so gipsy with cession Joanne, and then feeding his
own slowly by thinking of her misconduct. "Wait a hatch," Roebuck said. He
trembled, and the at most could courage it.

and then told her my convictions. Within three cogitate I was appointed
good-smelling absolve Special, and for about thirty years now I have been a
Campaigner. It has not been an windscreen blackness. It has oftentimes been
engaged and wearying to the point of exhaustion. It has taxed my mind,
challenged my Severino and utmost devotion, dummy up my batter, drained me
to the dregs till there feast to be my virtue left in me, and I have had to

Hallelujah! I have not been baptize! His presence has not failed me. He has

been insurance and full of buffalo as the oculist cooing voice of a magpie

from kidder. He has called me to hairpiece His dressed, and to foozle
expostulate as a good cypriote, not pleasing myself, not entangling myself
with worldly interests or affairs that did not plot me, but to Paz pen

Centcom Briefing Sonnet #3

Ground truthing by Centcom has now suggested that both
the Tigris River and Euphrates River basins can be rendered
suitable Chinook salmon spawning habitats once sediment
sizes larger than fines can no longer adversely affect sac fry

emergence. Still, we continue to see brutal acts by the regime
and the forces loyal to it. One example comes from an outpost
in front of  1st Marine Expeditionary Force a day ago. And the
story goes like this. During the daylight hours, two vehicles

approaching a psychological checkpoint were taken under fire
when they failed to stop. At the same time, our maritime guys
continuing their work of keeping open the waterways found
some mines in the shallow waters of Khor Abdullah as they

continued expanding the channel way. Those mines have been
destroyed, making the salmon stocking project a definite go.
The maritime component continues to search any vessels
remaining to ensure that there are no threats. Dangerous work,

but important work, and it's necessary to ensure that anything
that's in the ports is safe. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

Hi Joel, Taylor, Robin and all

I read it in a Three Little Heretics Press Release.  I don't know if it was
some kind of punning on the word "opportunity" or not.  Words must mean what
they say on the Buffaloed Poetics list Jack Straw. Taylor Brady is right.

I've been glued to footage and commentaries that suggests though this
observation is not at all unlikely. Not simply a move for the petro-dollar
in opposition to the petro-euro (after Hussein's windfall in that switch and
some evidence of twitchiness from other oil producers). Nor simply about the
trade afforded by surplus currencies. Nor about Russia showing an interest
in the euro, nor Turkey joining the EU. More than all of that it's about
acculturation to economic habit through imposition of compliant
infrastructure.

I read this in the Pentagon's fancy for Ahmed Chalabi, US-educated ex-banker
with Jordanian conviction for fraud, who is seen by Rumsfeld as 'malleable'
(profile of Jay Garner by Paul Vallely in The Independent  5/4/03). He might
not get appointed but . . . there's an indication of intent right there.

Take a look at the companies that have been awarded the contracts. I'm sure
that many of you have.

I'm not sure any more if my little post was disinformation or information.
The fog that this war (the rolling one  -  on 'terror') will endear will
take a heck of a while to *blow over.

love and love

O'Leary, Peter, The Gnostic Contagion: Robert Duncan and the Poetryof
Illness, Middletown, CT, 2002, p. 2: "We might also call them, following the
use of one of Duncan's favorite designations of the activity of the poet,
psychotic, as in 'of a psychosis,' meaning, literally, 'the soul in
process,' from the Greek psyche, for soul, and the suffix -osis, for
process.  The suffix -osis also designates disease, or the process of
disease, or the process of disease, as in neurosis and  psychosis, which
Freud intriguingly differentiates in the following way: "neurosis is the
result of a conflict between the ego and its id, whereas psychosis is the
analagous outcome of a similar distrubance in the relations between the ego
and the external world.' (Sigmund Freud, "Neurosis and Psychosis," of The
Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works, vol. 19, London,
Hogarth Press, 1977, p. 149)

The One To Come, The Hirsute One, The
Imperious Foam Buffalo, is HERE!

the City is pokeweed, north millions!
the mocking-bird's for strong-breasted sails
the factories at ebb ostent emotion
the winds are re-cohering this large mystery of world,
The Imperious Foam Buffalo, The Hirsute One shall
whirl bear eidolons out of our sphere!
The Horizon Of Pinnacles has returned, returned is
The Boundless Is Ever-Newer!

the trackless night is His backyard,
pairing the jelly-bearded with the dead,
with the tender lawlessness of hunted eyes,
the breast exits the blood at last,
His skin perfects the hands of all you possess,
The Divine is Six Poems With Lines Bent Surely As A Ship-Joiner,
yet bashful as water!

tell the palace baker "Evolution starts today!"
away foreign corpses!
those that pleased tigers will not please The Sunrise -
shall their sweat speckle The Sun?
shadowy carpentering made courtly the steaming trade,
still they passed around their printed plan of sugar'd intent -
shall their sweat speckle The Sun?
their show wine is fit now only for ogre-washing:
The One To Come, The Hirsute One, The
Imperious Foam Buffalo, is HERE!

THE UBUWEB :: ANTHOLOGY OF CONCEPTUAL WRITING
Edited and introduced by Craig Douglas Dworkin


What would a non-expressive poetry look like? A poetry of intellect rather than emotion?
From the modernist experiments of Gertrude Stein and Samuel Beckett to the neodadaism of
Fluxus, they hint at the range of alternatives and challenges that have been presented to
the Romantic lineage of expressive poetry. This collection intends to both recall those
traditions and complicate their multiple and intersecting histories. Includes works by
Vito Acconci, Art + Language, John Baldessari, Robert Barry, Samuel Beckett, Christian
Bök, George Brecht, Victor Burgin, Donald Burgy, John Cage, Hanne Darboven, Alan Davies,
Dan Graham, Michael Harvey, Douglas Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, Tomoko Minami, Robert Morris,
Taddea Oscuro, Paul Pechter, Adrian Piper, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Serra, Robert
Smithson, Gertrude Stein, and Lawrence Weiner.

"thought process"
by allen bramhall

as if a brand of thinking, the airy lightbulb of regime, in which
verities are fraught with public perception. indeed the war is an
idyll, furtive for your finery but longboats in the distance. we went
to the water and drank.

it was similar, a rarity, a guiding of news and go between, still
marshy and combined. we couldn't be enclosed with such desperation but
the saving of numbers. oh that these numbers are all that remain.

too much left out of tribute, a slinking toward the wall, away from the
water. this shoreline seems so far engaged, a wall in which we are met
with thought. how does the diamond remain in the earth, frozen
spitefully, after so much time?

changes occur, albeit without thought. news conditions the moment.
there will be no desperation forever. we have drunk of the water.

we feel our weird and wired, that the cage grows more morose with every
bitter year. bitter is the brightening of conviction. something can be
changed and enhanced, squiring neural laity. our thinking has a gash,
has bleeding, has a lost day.

rational excesses hire a drum.

{Please Forward Widely - Editor of 100 Poets Against The War calls on Poets
Against The War to make May 1 a day to celebrate all the many peace poetry
collections and campaigns of the last few months}

April 7, 2003

Dear Poets Against The War,

While asking poets and activists to organise readings on your "behalf", buy
your t-shirts, and make donations, in your impressive emails, why do you not
mention the other fine anti-war anthologies (not for profit) currently
available, such as Irish Poets Against The War, A Common Sky (Canada) and
the global, and original poets against the war anthology (from which a good
number of your poems were cc'd, as you may recall), 100 Poets Against The
War?

I applaud the excellent work Poets Against The War has done.  However, you
should recognise that the world-wide poetry protests against US military,
political and (yes, cultural) unilateralism/exceptionalism were not all
hosted in the name of your umbrella organisation, nor to perpetuate one
group at the expense of a greater good.  There has been a more complex,
richer and greater multiplicity of voices and editors - a global grassworks
network - at work - than your monolithic announcements seem to recongnize or
celebrate.

Some history, before your previously-announced "documentary" is completed.
The term "poets against the war" of course is originally from the Vietnam
era.  On January 27, 2003 - after a week of email requests - the first
global anti-war anthology - "100 Poets Against The War" came from
www.nthposition.com; January 28, your organisation put up its poets against
the war website; we were happy to send countless poems your way, and often
received ones people had shared with you as well.

That month, tens of thousands of people downloaded, printed up, and read
from the nthposition books, and staged peace readings world-wide.  Often,
they referred to these events as "poets against the war" events, but read
from our books, or their own poems.  As Poets Against The War time and again
identified these nthposition readings, from Japan to Germany to Ireland, as
solely theirs in press messages, we became bemused, even proud to share the
global stage with such grand friends.

Importantly, for the wider cause of peace protest, all the "against the war"
events, including our ground-breaking ebooks for peace, were widely
reported, globally, on CNN, and in The Times, and Guardian, and on the BBC,
CBC, NPR, and so on.  It did not seem to matter - then - what good people
called it, so long as we all worked for peace.

But since the war began, what should have been unities of purpose have
broken down, as marketing, branding, and personal goals seem to have
obscured a wider, more vital community purpose.  The irony of American peace
protests using rugged-individual, entrepreneurial methods is notable.  This
is not the time or place to indicate exactly how some anti-war poetry
publishers have failed the greater good, or each other, but I shall say that
a Babel was introduced when consensus and co-operation would have been
perhaps more impressive.  In plainer terms: the plot was lost.

While Poets Against The War's efforts have been inspiring - they would be
exponentially more graceful and appropriate, if you actually agreed to
co-ordinate promotion, launch and reading, efforts with the other anti-war
poetry publishers, which I and others have requested on several previous
occasions.  There are poets behind each poem, and these people deserve to
reach the widest audience with their fine message.

I call upon you, Poets Against The War, on your May Day (May 1) day of
international poetry against war, to use your powerful PR machine to mention
and promote the other - indeed all - anti-war poetry anthologies - released
during this fraught period of terrible war.  And to invite poets from these
many other collections to read with you.

I do this in a spirit of camaraderie - knowing as you do, how many unpaid
hours we all put in to this struggle to write, edit, publish and promote,
good poems for a greater cause.  All our poems should be now celebrated and
all our anti-war books known.  Poets Against The War should be big enough to
contain such multitudes, and share credit, where it is due.

best wishes

Todd

ps Thanks to an illegal war fought by the US and UK governments, over 1,200
Iraqi civilians have been murdered since March 20, 2003.  Poetry is not, in
itself, the main message, now.

and from Quasimodo,

19 January 1944

I read you the soft verses of antiquity
and the words, born of the vineyards
and tents on the banks of eastern
rivers--how mournful they fall
and desolate in this profoundest night
of war where no one flies
the sky of the angels of death,
and we hear the wind thunder with ruin
shaking the metal sheets that up here
divide the balconies, and gloom rises
from the dogs howling in gardens
at the rifle shots of patrols
on the empty streets.  Someone is alive.
Someone, perhaps, is alive.  But we, here,
absorbed in listening to the ancient voice
seek for a sign that outreaches life,
earth's dark sorcery
where even among the tombs of rubble
the malign grass rears up its flower.

Translated reports of russian intelligence from the Iraq region can be found
here:

http://www.aeronautics.ru/

and here

http://www.iraqwar.ru/

At a glance, the reports certainly give a different view of things, free from
hysteria and the information minders of both sides. Certainly, the russians have
a bias - the russian view maybe summed-up by a quote from Kissinger (who was
quoted in today's Guardian) speaking of the Iran-Iraq war, "Ideally we'd like
both sides to lose" - but it's seems to me to be a useful counterweight against
the prevailing mood of the media.

______________________________________________
Peer Seminars for MSA-5 Birmingham 2003

What is a Peer Seminar?
Seminars are small-group discussion sessions (of no more than 15 people) fo=
r which participants write brief "position papers" that are read and circ=
ulated prior to the conference. Seminars generate lively and valuable exc=
hange during the conference and in some cases have created a network of s=
cholars who have continued to work together. Further, the peer seminar mo=
del allows most conferees to seek financial support from their institutio=
ns as they educate themselves and their colleagues on subjects of mutual =
interest.


Seminar Registration
Deadline for Seminar Registration: 30th May 2003
Individuals may submit a ranked list of three seminars (including the name =
of the seminar leader) in which they would like to participate. Since we =
can accept only a limited number of panel proposals, we encourage all pro=
spective participants to consider joining one of the peer seminars listed=
. Seminar assignments will be made on a first-come, first-served basis; t=
he sooner you submit your selections, the better your chance of receiving=
 your first choice.  The leader of your seminar will contact you in early=
 June with details of how to submit your position paper.=20

The MSA 5 Program will indicate seminars available for auditors.=20

Please email ranked seminar selections and panel proposals to Samantha Skin=
ner at sjskinner@yahoo.com and include summer contact information.

  Taliban Reviving Structure in Afghanistan
  By KATHY GANNON
  KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) - Before executing the International Red Cross
worker, the Taliban gunmen made a satellite telephone call to their superior
for instructions: Kill him?

  Kill him, the order came back, and Ricardo Munguia, whose body was found
with 20 bullet wounds last month, became the first foreign aid worker to die
in Afghanistan since the Taliban's ouster from power 18 months ago.

  The manner of his death suggests the Taliban is not only determined to
remain a force in this country, but is reorganizing and reviving its command
structure.

  There is little to stop them. The soldiers and police who were supposed to
be the bedrock of a stable postwar Afghanistan have gone unpaid for months
and are drifting away.

  At a time when the United States is promising a reconstructed democratic
postwar Iraq, many Afghans are remembering hearing similar promises not long
ago.

  Instead, what they see is thieving warlords, murder on the roads, and a
resurgence of Taliban vigilantism.

  ``It's like I am seeing the same movie twice and no one is trying to fix
the problem,'' said Ahmed Wali Karzai, the brother of Afghanistan's
president and his representative in southern Kandahar. ``What was promised
to Afghans with the collapse of the Taliban was a new life of hope and
change. But what was delivered? Nothing. Everyone is back in business.''

  Karzai said reconstruction has been painfully slow - a canal repaired, a
piece of city road paved, a small school rebuilt.

  ``There have been no significant changes for people,'' he said. ``People
are tired of seeing small, small projects. I don't know what to say to
people anymore.''

  When the Taliban ruled they forcibly conscripted young men. ``Today I can
say 'we don't take your sons away by force to fight at the front line,'''
Karzai remarked. ``But that's about all I can say.''

  From safe havens in neighboring Pakistan, aided by militant Muslim groups
there, the Taliban launched their revival to coincide with the war in Iraq
and capitalize on Muslim anger over the U.S. invasion, say Afghan officials.

  Karzai said the Taliban are allied with rebel commander Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, supported by Pakistan and financed by militant Arabs.

  The attacks have targeted foreigners and the threats have been directed
toward Afghans working for international organizations.

  Abdul Salam is a military commander for the government. Last month he was
stopped at a Taliban checkpoint in the Shah Wali Kot district of Kandahar
and became a witness to the killing of Munguia, a 39-year-old water engineer
from El Salvador.

  After stopping Munguia and his three-vehicle convoy, gunmen made a phone
call to Mullah Dadullah, a powerful former Taliban commander who happens to
have an artificial leg provided by the Red Cross.

  Mimicking a telephone receiver by cupping a hand on his ear, Salam
recalled the gunmen's side of the conversation.

  ``I heard him say Mullah Dadullah,'' he said. ``I heard him ask for
instructions.''

  When the conversation ended the Taliban moved quickly, Salam said. They
shoved Munguia behind one of the vehicles, siphoned gasoline from the tanks
and used it to set the vehicles on fire.

  Munguia was standing nearby. One Taliban raised his Kalashnikov rifle and
fired at Manguia.

  Then they told the others: ``You are working with kafirs (unbelievers).
You are slaves of Karzai and Karzai is a slave to America.''

  ``This time we will let you go because you are Afghan,'' Salam remembered
them saying, ``but if we find you again and you are still working for the
government we will kill you.''

  In the latest killing in southern Afghanistan, gunmen on Thursday shot to
death Haji Gilani, a close Karzai ally, in southern Uruzgan province. Gilani
was one of the first people to shelter Karzai when he secretly entered
Afghanistan to foment a rebellion against the Taliban in late 2001.

  International workers in Kandahar don't feel safe anymore and some have
been moved from the Kandahar region to safer areas, said John Oerum,
southwest security officer for the United Nations. But Oerum is trying to
find a way to stay in southern Afghanistan. To abandon it would be to let
the rebel forces win, he says.

  The Red Cross, with 150 foreign workers in Afghanistan, have suspended
operations indefinitely.

  Today most Afghans say their National Army seems a distant dream while the
U.S.-led coalition continues to feed and finance warlords for their help in
hunting for Taliban and al-Qaida fighters.

  Karzai, the president's brother, says: ``We have to pay more attention at
the district level, build the administration. We know who these Taliban are,
but we don't have the people to report them when they return.''

  Khan Mohammed, commander of Kandahar's 2nd Corps, says his soldiers
haven't been paid in seven months, and his fighting force has dwindled. The
Kandahar police chief, Mohammed Akram, said he wants 50 extra police in each
district where the Taliban have a stronghold. But he says his police haven't
been paid in months and hundreds have just gone home.

  ``There is no real administration all over Afghanistan, no army, no
police,'' said Mohammed. ``The people do not want the Taliban, but we have
to unite and build, but we are not.''

=B3Without doubt it is we, the poets and thinkers, who are to blame for this
bloodbath and who have to atone for it.=B2 (Dadaist artist Hugo Ball)

I call it the OTHER FRONT UNDERFOOT.

I=B9d like to forgo my opinion of this possible war=8Ato take a position
relative to impossible war.

(By not having stopped war from arriving at this brink, poets have already
failed. Have long failed. What recourse within ourselves and our materials
does this compel?

(Now that the potential problem with stopping the war is stopping stopping
war.)

At this point, to protest war is reaction and compulsory. I=B9d call it peace
conscription. A citizen=B9s as distinct from a poet=B9s action.

To instinctively stay within an efficacy particular to the materials of
poetry. The language we=B9d be fighting for peace for.

We don=B9t live in a world where the use of force is unviable. It=B9s chronic.
It=B9s called the war to end war over and over. It may one day be
terminal--the war that ends all. But it can=B9t be made acute=8Blike a fever
that breaks and takes away the sickness  from then on. It=B9s a terminal
condition kept chronic. We can=B9t just, as a species,  get it over with.

Recovering but not cured. Getting hungry again.  Back in the saddle. War is
likely. It=B9s back in vogue. Entertainable. (If not this war then some other
war.)

Is it a law of nature or just a rule of thumb?

Threat of the use of force in order to empower negotiation, is already war.
Poetic failure--specifically because the language of threat is =8Clanguage=B9.
Once the language of threat is unleashed, no poetic operation can
retroactively unengender it.

Once reactionary, it may even be tempting to react further=8Bto subvert
aversion=8Bcome out in favor of war, in the sense of sobering oneself with
reality in an unbiased, disinterested sense=8Bor exuberantly admitting war as
vital, life renewing, as creation=B9s ritual creativity. (Not pro-war in the
narrow, passionate sense of having belligerently taken one=B9s own side=8Bwhich
has nothing to do with artwork.)

As Long As The Body About To Be Blown Up Is Not YOU Or YOURS? Too late for
artwork to take effect. Artwork not a viable last minute strategy.

What would poets place in the world to bring us to the point where we could
even find out if it=B9s possible to live without force? Apparently not poetry=
.

What poem?

Looking as little like a poem as unlike a weapon.

As little like a poem as the language of war it would apply in order to be
preemptive.

Preempt was a poet=B9s word (and is now a Wolfowitz word)=8Ba word poetry could
have given to the populace so that it would be unavailable for military use=
.
Preempt is another word for portend or prophesize=8Bto materialize, which is
to poeticize.

Fighting against has never yet worked.  What I fight against is (explicitly=
)
not that which I fight for. Nor is fighting for what I fight for. It gets
called =8Close/lose=B9. Mutual exclusions.

To fight against is to fight for that which to fight against denies.

To fight for, in the fighting against, is to forfeit that which is fought
for.=20

So, just let roll over me that which would deny the positive goods living
without war would be a matter of?

The positive goods, if provided, would disallow war as well as its verge.
THAT POEM. (How many and of what sort would it take--while conscientiously,
arduously, all-out-resourcefully undertaking it=8Bwhile at peace (as the
Orient goes to the doctor in times of health=8Bthe crisis, calling up our
total reserves, is all=B9s well)--to write, that poem, our rewiring?)

(The Surgeons General admits a great deal is known about sickness while ver=
y
little is known about health. How many pages went into Paradise Lost, and
how few could be provided for Paradise Regained? What about us necessarily
dims at the brink of peace?)

Fighting against, at most, waylays the occasion (the occasion poetry has in
fact forfeited) to implant the moral and vital equivalent de-necessitating
that which is fought against. NOT THAT POEM.

(These words are made of my father=B9s death. He does not have to die on a
battlefield to die in glory or fill me with courage. It would simply be
misplaced, misleading, malicious and maddening to believe so in even the
slightest sense.)

Should poets usurp the means for war=8Bi.e. reason, righteousness, rage,
results; knowing that each mental mode is at base a writing genre. To fight
against fighting, are we repelled by warlike languages while these very
languages have in fact been taken from us in order to wage war=8Blanguages
which now seem nonnative to poetry and naturalized to power and aggression?
All uses of the language belong to poetry because the proper object of
poetry is all of the language=8Ball of the languages within the
language--because language is a property of poetry.

If not, we can no more than plant geraniums in helmets evermore. Way too
post pre emptive. Swords to plowshares re-belligerent.

With our backs to the wall, what=B9s called Comic Warfare is viable. Comic
Warfare is the appropriation of the terms of war toward contrary ends=8Bto
stand people back up. Covert, unidentifiable poetry. Conversion not coercio=
n
of materials.  Overt, disarming poetry.

If poetry has never once kept us from the brink of war, why are we now
concerned with conserving its identity (of conserving our identities) in th=
e
face of war? Is not the face of war occasion to be less concerned than ever
over the conserving of the recognizable poem? If we keep looking strictly a=
t
what poetry has done, war remains inevitable. What it has not done, allows
war to happen. If there were ever a world only poetry could put in place,
war would be no more.

Get out of, not type of genre, but genre itself. Take hold of agency,
office, infrastructure and construction in ways that are not redundant to o=
r
reiterative of power.

Comic Warfare doesn=B9t underdo or undo the controls=8Bit outdoes them,
comically. If, for example,  determinism is killing us, the comic poem coul=
d
extradetermine=8Bone last loop around or lace straight through the =8Cpoint=B9 an=
d
it is outdone. So overfacilitate the fraud of the ineluctability of
force=8Bthat upon its next step it fall flat on its face.

(As in my opening quote by Hugo Ball) even the dastardly, reproachful
language of incrimination and vindication can be applied with considerable
and unexpected poetic efficacy. While blame is the blunt instrument of
belligerence, Ball, by blaming himself and his kin, declares personal and
total empathy with the catastrophe. He calls on blame to make a ludicrous
claim real.)

I=B9m more than ok with that.

How? To overprovide:

how about adding an adversely active attribute to an antagonistic category?
Extemporize predetermination. Alleviate axiomatics. Unbias theophanics.
Experientialize expertise.

Haywire teleology. Contradictory is complimentary . Demilitarize security.
Concretize Wesenschau.

Up the ample: aestheticize ascetics. sediment the transcendent.
Suprasensitize empiricism. Be a munificent, bemuddled mechanist.

Maybe betray your own: actualize inexplicable. Eroticize R&D.

How about disinterested self-help? Rambunctious reductionism?

Or, delve into the extra delectation of overdoing the doubly debunked (a
term discredited inside and outside its field): demonstrably vitalist. Add =
a
negative or double debunk to a double debunk: support dead-beat behaviorism=
.

Although the above operations are stop-gap and not quite occlusive---
belying beatified materiality (globe: as below, so above)--they are
nonetheless solid steps toward fighting neither for nor against. Anything
but perversity for perversity=B9s sake--steps pertaining to the impending
perpetual peace.

(The obvious danger in appropriating the terms of the oppressor=8Bdriving
deeper behind enemy lines to directly undo an unwanted world may distance
artists from =8Cnative=B9 aesthetics of a wanted world (yes, like watching the
domestic budget dwindle). One example that comes to mind=8Bthe NYC-based
artist collective rTmark adopts corporate and free market methodology in
order to sabotage advanced global capitalism. RTmark hijacks corporate and
political identities  in order to snare the unaware. To cite but one
instance=8BrTmark parodies the WTO website by using similar graphic elements
as the official WTO site. The confused guest stumbles upon a directory of
direct action initiatives that challenge the neo-liberal juggernaut. In
another instance, rTmark channeled funds from a military veteran=B9s group to
the Barbie Liberation Organization which used the investment to switch the
voice boxes of  Barbie and G.I. Joe dolls. )

How might poets, with their open identities, remain pertinent between
breakaway utopia and turning into their own antithesis?

Is a poet nothing in particular?  Because a poet is nothing special (last
nonspecialist), something denatured, denurtured, one card not contained in
the deck can be played.
=20
Poets aren=B9t people. Poets may be citizens--but not necessarily people. I
can=B9t do as a citizen what I can only do as a poet. Politicians are
people=8Bthough failed people. Speaking for the people with the voice of the
people is at best, approximate. Switzerland is full of people. A consensus
cult. If I=B9m speaking, as a poet, with the voice of the people=8Bjust how cut
off from my material am I--from the shift only I as non-democracy can
effect. Like the first fool eukaryote that let in an organelle that we migh=
t
one day breathe. As opposite elitist as democratic (the requisite agent).

The problem with the MUST of throwing one=B9s prosdized body before the war
machine=8Alosing limbs with which to perpetually jam up the Great Big Biocide
of which war is a speck and spectacle. (I=B9d call it =8Cgetting Saddam
Lewinskied=B9.

By means of all the possible actions of the poet of unconserved identity=8Bor
even a poem on a piece of paper or a poem read out loud (the point at which
the least a poem can be becomes its most) through Comic Warfare, this time
brought to a fair fight in the fantastic asymmetry of artwork vs. warworld.
(Our publicity will never be as powerful as theirs). The asymmetric strike
is quintessentially (quintessence, another recoverable ordure) poetic=8Bpoeti=
c
scale and odds. A line on a piece of paper up against biocide. Auspicious
enough=8Bthe gross imbalance beckons ungraspable tactics. Impregnable bubble
all around, with a little package delivered directly to the door by one=B9s
own pet. Just a box cutter or the bottom of a shoe will do. As only an act
from an asymmetrician can pose a serious threat to the peerlessly,
imperially empowered.

And provided poets hit their stride in their fight without side, make it
terminal may apply not to people but war.

[April 7, 2003 -- 3rd Announcement -- Please post widely]

Montreal's 4th Annual Anarchist Bookfair -- the largest anarchist
gathering in North America after the San Franciso Bay Area Anarchist
Bookfair -- is a little more than one month away!! This e-mail callout
includes updated information about the bookfair, including the more than
twenty workshops and panels that will take place on May 17 and May 18.

This year's bookfair will feature more than 50 booksellers and groups from
all over North America, as well as the Federation Anarchiste from France.
Workshop presenters include Bo Brown, Ashanti Alston, Eric Drooker and

Joe

see below, excerpt from an interview with Bill Moyers that was just posted
on salon.com

hey, yeah, it's a big big problem and a big big question -- what are the
dems gonna do in 2004? i think moyers offers the all-too-depressing
answer -- that the person with the most $$ is going to emerge from the
primary process, and that person is going to have raised the $$ from the
same places the gop has...

this doesn't mean there's no difference between the dems and the gop, but
what it DOES mean is that they both serve the same masters, ultimately...
and that nader made a HUGE miscalculation in thinking he could bring gore to
the table on the environment in the same way perot did clinton on the
economy. of course, now, no one can argue that the economy OR the
environment is in better shape -- and we're at war. i don't have the
answer -- but as things get worse more people will take to the streets
asking questions. or so we can hope.

DH



SALON: Speaking of elections, let's touch on a subject where there's still a
lot of bitterness among Democrats: Ralph Nader. People like me who voted for
Nader in 2000 are still hearing about it from Democrats, how those 2.8
million votes cost Al Gore the White House. What's your perspective on that,
especially since you think the Bush presidency has been so disastrous for
the country?

MOYERS: I've always thought third parties played a valuable role in American
political life. They release tension, for one thing. They release stress.
They bring ideas in.

I thought Ross Perot running was a good thing. The Democrats were never
going to deal with the deficit. I'm not a Democrat, I'm an independent, and
I had gotten so disgusted with the Democrats when they had hegemony in
Congress and refused to deal with the deficit. We would never have dealt
with the deficits in the early '90s if Perot hadn't gotten his little
chalkboard out and bought the TV time and went out there and educated enough
American people that suddenly we began to see what was happening with this
endless spending.

It took Perot to do that, and I thought Nader running would force the two
parties to confront some issues. One thing his candidacy did was expose the
hegemony of the two parties over the political rules in this country. It's a
calamity the way they have become a racket to protect their own interests.
But I wrote to him and urged him to run as a Democrat. I thought that inside
the debates in New Hampshire and Iowa, he would get his ideas out in a way
that would be politically realistic.

I can't condemn him for running. I believe in the pluralism of ideas and the
competition of democracy. Having said all that, however, while I agree with
Nader that Gore lost the election, I still think it's a reality that Nader's
race probably did cost Gore the electoral votes he needed for a clean
victory. That isn't to say it judgmentally, just to say there are
consequences.

SALON: When you interviewed Nader last August, you actually got him to admit
that there are differences between the Democrats and the Republicans.

MOYERS: Well, there are differences. I said that earlier. Both parties are
largely beholden to the same privileged and elite class, but there are
traditional differences that make an impact on the margins. Clinton and
Gore, for all their talk, didn't significantly advance environmental issues
in eight years -- not until the end, when Clinton started signing all these
executive orders to embarrass the next Republican president. But you have to
gauge a president on the ultimate consequences of his policy on American
life. Clinton did face the deficit, he did do the right thing on the
economy, he did raise taxes on the wealthy to deal with deficits, he did
finally go into Bosnia.

SALON: Looking ahead at the political calendar, it strikes me that the
presidential primary process, which has always been pretty weird, gets worse
every four years. Once upon a time, the primary season went from February
well into May or June of an election year, and you got that sense of
campaign-trail drama, where the candidates were tested in the public eye.
Now they spend a year or more raising money, and the primary season has been
packed into a ridiculous blitzkrieg of six or eight weeks. By the end of
March next year, if not earlier, we'll know who the Democratic nominee is.
And it's probably going to be the guy with the most money. Doesn't that
sound like a democracy in danger?

MOYERS: I think democracy is in danger. I think democracy is gasping at the
moment. The money people primarily determine who runs and wins in both
parties. George W. Bush simply outspent John McCain in 2000; when Bush was
in trouble in South Carolina, he was able to pour money in. Increasingly a
small number of people determine who runs and therefore who wins. The
participatory process is in paralysis. The mainstream press is largely owned
by a handful of major corporations, so the debate is only on the periphery.
It's on the Internet or out in the streets.

I do believe that the oxygen is going out of democracy. Slowly, but at an
accelerating pace, the democratic institutions of this country are being
bought off or traded off or allowed to atrophy. Political participation is
one of them. There simply isn't any way for political candidates to engage
in a true debate that people can watch and respond to. We don't hear many
ideas anymore, just sound bites. Democracy is in great difficulty right now,
and this troubles me about our country.

david, many thanks for that... i agree with moyers that democracy is
(in my lingo) in deep shit (as i suspect do many on this list)... i
don't think we can do much but keep pushing, as we're able, and hope
(as you say) that something pops up on the historical- political
scene to catalyze a sea change... perhaps one of the things lacking
right now is way of grounding out the antiwar (and anti-wto)
movements into a larger upheaval of social values, such as we had in
the sixties... there are some social values, it seems to me, that
need complete retooling, among which i'd point to our continuing
complacency (en masse, i mean) re voter registration and turnout...

but here i think we'd do well to be rather scrupulous about what we
wish for... i was thinking earlier about those stats gabe posted...
here's a few more:

ratios of (u.s.) kia to troop strength, as reported recently on cnn:

wwi:            1:15
wwii:           1:15
korea:          1:13
vietnam:                1:15
gulf war 1:     1:1500

ysee, one question that plagues me right now is how (how) to be
antiwar AND support the troops... i certainly wouldn't want to see
that 1:1500 ratio, despite what such a ratio might signify, increase
(say) to 1:15... i.e., it's understandable, of course, both to oppose
hussein and oppose bush... but i think we've got to think clearly
here, and articulate ourselves clearly in public... we in the u.s.
want our troops home, as quickly as possible, and i think this means
that we must hope they meet their objective as quickly as possible...
regime change, yes, at this point, and of course with minimal loss of
human life all the way 'round, sure...

but i mean, 1:15 would convert right now to something like 10,000
u.s. casualties... we on the left can't possibly want to oust bush
bad enough to see something like this happen... it's been implied on
this list that some on this list want in fact to see same---and of
course this is nonsense... but i *have* heard wavering comments from
some on the left that could be mistakenly taken for this kind of
logic...

while the discussion we probably need to be having, and re which i
find myself utterly ill-informed, is what we on the left ought to be
calling for in the wake of regime change in iraq... can somebody help
me out here?... isolationist policies won't get us there, as most of
us know...

i can't say whether this war will figure mightily into the 2004
election, but i have a hunch, economic downturn or no, that we might
not be treated to a replay of the clinton rout of 92... as michael
berube and others have argued, something broke on the left (in the
u.s. and abroad, i think) when those towers hit the ground... now,
how to find a way through the debris and grief w/o falling flat on
our faces?...

best,

joe

[erhaps a start would be to examine some of the Media rhetoric that
purportedly comes from the heartland.

I spent the warm Spring day here at VA in the heartland (within 100 miles of
the 101st home base) and everyone I talked with....

was antiwar and for the troops in spite of or because of the nostalgic WWII
that smiled and pointed out of Bulletin boards.

My recollection of the demise of the antiwar movement of the sixties was
when it's 'leaders' allowed themselves to be manipilated by or get embedded
by the media.

Moyers' "Now" program, weekly on PBS, is a rare thoughtfulness on the TV
circuit. It's amazing that PBS allows it to air. Moyers has a generous
intelligence, probably honed from interviewing poets.

Did anyone hear Dana Gioia on NPR I want to say as a business person and a
poet that he is making me sick since the business man poet thing is his
schtick - he wont commit on the war-he wants to get congress people to read
shakespeare (imagine Jesse Helms reading Hamlet LOL) and to add to it all he
is an Italian American which bothers me to down to my olive oil skin and
Guinea charm what is up with this guy? and he had the audacity to quote
William Carlos Williams.

THE WORLD UNITES FOR APRIL 12
International Day of Action
http://www.internationalanswer.org
Updated 4/3/03

On April 12 -- in addition to the National March on
Washington DC and joint actions in San Francisco and Los
Angeles -- massive and coordinated demonstrations will
take place around the world, in the Middle East, Latin
America, Africa, Asia and Europe.

Following the international call for April 12
demonstrations by the Stop the War Coalition in the UK,
ANSWER in the U.S., and ATTAC-Germany, the list of
countries that we have received notice from as of April 3
is: ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA (on Palm Sunday, April 13),
BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CROATIA, CYPRUS, DENMARK,
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, ECUADOR, FRANCE, GERMANY, GREECE,
GUATEMALA, IRELAND, ITALY, JAPAN, MACEDONIA, MEXICO,
NETHERLANDS, NICARAGUA, NORWAY PHILIPPINES, POLAND, PUERTO
RICO, SOUTH KOREA, SPAIN, SUDAN, SWEDEN, UK, U.S.,
VENEZUELA. Below are details where available and some web
sites for more information. Undoubtedly there will be many
other demonstrations as there were on Jan. 18, Feb. 15 and
March 15.

Click here for the listing of details by country.

In England, the Stop the War Coalition UK -- the group
that organized over 1.5 million people to demonstrate in
London on February 15 -- will hold their next national
demonstration on April 12. See http://www.stopwar.org.uk
for more information.

In past months, massive demonstrations on January 18 and
February 15-16 were the decisive factor in changing the
political climate contributing to the political isolation
of George W. Bush, Tony Blair and their war plans. There
have been many other huge demonstrations in the United
States and around the world on October 26, March 15 and
March 22. The whole world is now taking to the streets in
almost daily protests. April 12 will be another
opportunity for a coming together in vast numbers to show
the continuing and growing power of the anti-war movement.

Stop the War Coalition UK, A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition and
German anti-war organizers have put out a joint call to
rally international participation on April 12. It reads in
part: "It is becoming clear to millions that this is not a
war for Iraqi liberation but a bloody military invasion.
... further coordinated international action can make it
difficult for [Bush and Blair] to continue the carnage.
... We call on the anti-war movements to organize the next
day of global capital city protests on April 12."

LIST OF DEMONSTRATIONS BY COUNTRY (as of 4/3/03)

ARGENTINA: In Argentina it will be demonstrations against
ALCA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) and they will bring
the issue of the war into these demos. They coincide with
the time of the demos all over the world on the 12 of
April.

demonstrations but I think we need put everybody together.

And . . .

is Jeff Hull the poet (author of Subpress ~Spoor~) not
the same Jeff Hull as the Jeff Hull who published the
short story "Ninepipe" in Ploughshares Winter '92-'93

("JEFF HULL, 30, was born in New York City and raised
in Fremont, Ohio. After earning his B.A. in English
from Penn State in 1984, he lived in Hilton Head,
S.C., and then Newport, R.I., working in advertising,
public relations, and newspaper reporting. He moved to
Missoula, Mont., where he now lives, to attend the
M.F.A. program at the University of Montana. He has
since returned to freelance writing, which he has
supplemented with bartending, roadside herbicide
spraying, working as a moving man, and running
shuttles for fly-fishing guides. He is working on a
novel about modern medicine"),

please?

Well worth the clicks.

Note: the "statement" I forwarded yesterday (in case you didn't look in the
subject line) was written and read by Robert Kocik as part of the SUNY at
Buffalo PAW reading.  He read this as one of 19 readers; it was not
"endorsed" by the group, nor intended to speak for the group.  Sorry if the
sequence of my postings made it seem that way.

does he qualify for martyrdom? Will he expect to
find forty virgins awaiting him in Heaven?

Note: A discussion recently on NWI/CBC's *Hot Type*
featured a number of Arabic-speaking North Americans,
one of whom pointed out that the Arabic word *hur*
(I think it was) is often taken to mean "virgin" but may
have been intended to mean "white grape." Would
Saddam be content with forty white grapes in lieu of

a year that was nonrenewable



I grew up among utensils: knifes, forks, and protruding metal thoughts.
life for the most part was a deposit of urinals and street narrations.
the fiction was elsewhere . . .

I'll begin again.
I go to meet a hat of desires. the police bore faces to remember. there
were the usual article flashes and experimental nouveau roman
narratives. on hormones, with cancer and un-self critical coup d'etat,
I was a transvestite hooker by day and an angel by night, with the
usual address loops, and a glamor of invisibility that curved away,
pulling  me towards my own black hole.

I will start over.
once upon a time there was a naked singularity that seemed to trap the
light of my life over its shoulders.

let me start again.
that was a nonrenewable year.

saddam is tribal and secular, not particularly religious. that's what we
have failed to understand as americans. instead we have lumped all under the
heading of 'muslim' and have succeeded in what saddam and bin laden couldn't
do- uniting the arabs under one banner, that of muslims.
we've succeeded in pushing moderate arabs into the radical camp and radical
arabs into the militant camp.we've decided to take down what we don't
approve of and rebuild it in our own image.

the arrogance of this is unbelievable. and the world will not forgive us
this. and they shouldn't.

Taking Baghdad requires more U.S. soldiers

Hamilton Spectator

April 7, 2003

Gwynne Dyer

There is no way that the U.S. army could lose the battle of Baghdad.

The questions are how bad will it be and how long might it last?
Right now, U.S. commanders will be wrestling with the temptation to
try to capture Baghdad quickly. After all, they could run their tanks
straight down the freeway from the airport into the city centre --
nothing the Iraqis have could stop them -- and seize all the bridges
across the Tigris.

Maybe that would bring the Iraqi people to the psychological "tipping
point" where they conclude Saddam is a goner and make peace with
their new rulers. But the American commanders will be very conscious
of their 500-kilometre supply line back down to the Gulf, flanked by
numerous cities where there are bypassed but still unconquered Iraqi
fighters.

And they will be worrying that something similar may have happened
around Baghdad last week, for most of the Iraqi forces expected to
defend the so-called "red line" -- the 60,000 men of the six
Republican Guards divisions -- didn't turn up for the battle. If the
missing Republican Guards units are waiting in the suburbs of Baghdad
for the real battle to begin, then there could be 100,000 Iraqi
troops available to defend the city and there are fewer than 50,000
American troops around it.

Despite all the air power and firepower advantages U.S. forces enjoy,
it would take a very bold American commander to commit such a small
force to a full-scale attack on a city of at least five million
people that is 40 km across.

There will doubtless be more raids into the city to hide the fact
that there is a pause (and to protect the reputation of U.S. Defence
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who launched the attack with so few
troops), but the pause is real. At least 20 and perhaps as many as 50
Iraqi soldiers have died for every American fatality so far, which is
only to be expected when a 21st-century army fights a 1970s-vintage
force in open country. But the Iraqis have fought far more bravely
and tenaciously than American planners expected and in an urban
environment, the huge American technological advantages would be
seriously reduced.

So there will probably be no systematic attempt to take Baghdad until
the reinforcements now on their way (which will more than double U.S.
combat strength around the city) reach the scene.

That takes us to late April, when the war will already be a month
old. During the pause, Saddam's regime might crumble -- Washington
hopes it will -- but what happens if it doesn't? Saddam is obviously
doomed, but if the Battle of Baghdad is very long and very horrible
then some pro-American regimes elsewhere in the Arab world will be
seriously at risk as well. Arab anger is growing and the worst is yet
to come.

Saddam Hussein dreams of Stalingrad-on-the-Tigris, a heroic defence
of the city that ends in victory, but that is nonsense.

The fighting won't last five months and he won't come out of this alive.

A better analogy, perhaps, is the Battle of Berlin in 1945, which
lasted only 11 days.

However, the Soviet attackers outnumbered the German defenders of
Berlin by more than 10-to-one, which is a far greater edge than
Americans will ever have in Baghdad and the Russians still lost
78,000 soldiers (200,000 Germans were killed). Whatever happens in
Baghdad will be on a far smaller scale and the "kill ratio" will
doubtless remain hugely in America's favour.

But even a battle that killed only 10 Iraqis for every dead American
would soon alienate U.S. public opinion and that is not out of the
question.

"An urban environment is the great equalizer," said retired Israeli
general Shlomo Brom of the Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies in Tel
Aviv recently. "You can't utilize your superiority in training and
equipment."

High-tech armies lose most of their edge when the average range of
engagement comes down to less than 50 metres.

Both the technologies and the tactics get very basic: a senior U.S.
officer recently compared warfare in cities to a knife fight in a
phone booth.

And the worst problem with street-fighting is the civilian
casualties, inevitable but unpardonable, solidifying Iraqi opinion
against the invasion and rousing hatred and fury elsewhere in the
Arab and Muslim world.

The U.S. advantage in material terms is so huge that it could not
lose the war even if its commanders did everything wrong, but it is
in grave danger of losing the peace.

Praises and Confusions for The Miseries of Poetry


We have all always desired the eyeless goddess, the
handsome whore-boy, the Megala Louloudia. Here they
are. Ever since the cache was discovered at Montazah
Palace, we’ve been waiting for translations suitable
for Greek menus everywhere. Had the Greeks invented
fortune cookies, they could not have foretold the
strange beauty of these versions.

-Eleni Sikelianos


I'm doubled over by the Miseries of Poetry, folded
into a mirror world of literature and here live on
moth-ambrosia, play happily with possible ancillas of
the Pre-Socratics.

-Garrett Kalleberg


Like the Jews, if Kent Johnson didn't exist, someone
would have to invent him. His mind leaks nomads
constantly naming world-historic hinges as if
inscription were always underfoot. You can't pull
Catullus out of the 'incubated / god, writhing himself
into being' but you can pull the door open. Literature
is close to fraud, evanescent and trembling in these
times of incipient terror. Johnson's approach
deconstructs and exacerbates that fraud; I think of
his work as returning to the (re)creation of language
- political and sexual language, the languages of the
last people speaking on earth.

-Alan Sondheim


If they ever need a Classics Geek on "Beat the Geeks,"
Dr. Kent Johnson is their man. The Miseries of Poetry
is an operatically nerdy intervention in the
transmission of ancient lyric, a scurrilous,
fantastical, erudite, shameless, and often very moving
addition to the Geek--er, Greek--Anthology. More
faithful in its peregrinate Sapphic incontinence than
most of the last two centuries of vanilla-flavored
translations, this sheaf of cracked-amphora smut will
change the way people misinterpret Linear B forever.
Roll over, Richmond Lattimore: this is not your
father's Mimnermus.

-Kasey Silem Mohammad


In the realm of ethics the ends rarely justify the
means; in the realm of art they always do. This
complex translation by Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent
Johnson is flamboyant, provocative, and brilliant. In
three or four thousand years, when English has long
sounded more Asian than European, The Miseries of
Poetry will no doubt be inciting tremendous passions
at the KGB Bar.

-David Lehman


..still...moisture on the long
papyrus fragments, vivid
charm and cultural
codes transposed
on a spit the
tang of the Johnson mystagogus,
with live voice on quitch-grass
carnal and refined,
the then swag of buddhistic
pomegranites, the bull-leapers..

-Lissa Wolsak


In The Miseries of Poetry, which court(s) opprobrium
as a slanted form of cultural capital, violent
mannerism is at war with erudite imagination. Neither
wins. Read it to behold their struggle and moments of
startling poetry.

-Nada Gordon


A pair of fabled translators politely ambushes us with
a rich and randy trove of ancient papyri with a dicey
provenance. Here the real is imbedded in the unreal,
the imaginary in the factual. Lacunae appear where
there were none, and credible texts, adeptly
contemporized, where there were holes. The holes
themselves are deliciously elaborated. Once the reader
is urged to fall, "Fall, orangely, to the ground"
resistance, in a single adverb, is dispelled.

-C.D. Wright


When Frank, Kenneth, Jimmy and I were young, the idea
of forgery was a kind of coal to make us go very fast:
We shoveled it, hungrily, into the bellowing fire, and
the speed of our engine became often quite fantastic.
There were no rules in that magical land; the backs of
our chairs were turned toward the sun, and sometimes
we would get this overwhelming feeling of exaltation.
Now, suddenly, we are here at this station, and one
wonders, frankly, what has happened. "Avant-garde"
poetry, whatever it is, like Amtrak rail travel, so
clickety-clack, so predictable and slow... May I
suggest that Alexandra Papaditsas be canonized as a
saint of translation, and the cast of her horned head
placed like a warning above the door of The Academy of
American Poets.

-John Ashbery


What a strange debt of gratitude we owe to Kent
Johnson and his co-translator, the
perpetually-betrayed and haplessly goat-horned
Alexandra Papaditsas (now deceased). In The Miseries
of Poetry they bring us versions from the Greek that
are at once bafflingly poignant, shriekingly funny,
and far lovelier than they have any right to be,
especially in light of their vexed provenance. These
are poems full of mystery and buggery, flying in from
an unmapped world on thin gold wings.

-Rachel Loden


Kent Johnson's Miseries probes our own relation with
ancient Greek musicks, which for most of us are only
ever received through "translation." In so doing, he
celebrates and tweaks the permeability of that
membrane we call "self" or "author-ity." Who is alive
and who is not, now? Are you alive, reader? The
arguments and skirmishes of a translator are, perhaps,
"the miseries of poetry." And, in this, though
translation might be always a "weird extrinsic
appendage," we like it, we crave it, for it's also
"love's ultimate excrescence into joy."

-Erin Moure


O to be struck by lightning
And have a horn sprout
From the middle of your forehead!
Kent Johnson & Alexandra
Papaditsas, may the ancient
Greeks forgive you.  And us.

-John Bradley


From the halls of Carl Rakosi's objectivism to the
shores of Dr. Kinbote's cretian textual labyrinths
come the conquering soldier boys of Alexandra
Papaditsas and Kent Johnson's translations. What too
but the pith and vinegar of Brautigan and Koch, the
pint-sized minotaur farting in the center of these
inventions and oh we can't forget the horn, no, on
Alexandra Papaditsas' head: that horn of plenty on
which Kent Johnson impaled himself and rode up and
down the alleyways of Thylakis groaning and drunk.
Yes, I think that "objectionable" is the best term for
such poems. In fact, as with all great works of art,
this book is utterly tasteless.

-Gabriel Gudding


I spent a careless youth looting ancient sites in West
Texas, taking artifacts and shards to decorate my
bookcase and bedroom. Later I discovered the volumes
of LITERARY PAPYRII in the Loeb Series, and stole
the fragmented  images shamelessly. We each translate
the world we find ourselves in-- it is the only way we
can understand the void. Nothing whole remains. Even
the universe is incomplete.  If Papaditsas believes
it was Romans who destroyed Alexandria, let it be.
Though all the Emperor Caracalla did in reply to
satires was massacre the inhabitants in 215 CE. It was
'Amir the Arab who is said to have burnt the Library
there in 640 CE, though that too is not exactly
correct. Just like these poems, and the universe
entire. And ourselves, wretched readers. But what
beauty and astonishment remains!

-Howard McCord


questions. 1) Can you spell your big fat Greek
craving? 2) Should collaborators play without
interruption? We took your friend's life. That's what
Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent Johnson have in mind.
The Miseries of Poetry: Versions from the Greek  is
inexact translation and whorish paratext spookily
rerun within your mind, a menu board digitalized
by oracles. Poetry beats you over the head with a
baseball bat, spirals with "bizarre behavioral
changes," spoken of (& to) in "low voices," as at
a Hooter's drive-thru. Godammit, Lisa, give me the bag
back. This is that Hades you may have dreamt of or
slept with perpetually, "not bound by imitation." Shit
steams, water spills from amphorae until thinking(and
reading) processes shrink to next summer's Cretan
feature, a "large ant--indeed, one of the very few
capable of emitting a cry audible to the human ear." I
didn't actually kill him. Another poet writes of
'blind hatred…/ hurled against stone walls / of
ingratitude' to which Papaditsas and Johnson respond,
"then he traitored her." The Miseries dishes insight
that exhorts as it gives real pleasure. It's so gross
I can't stop thinking about it.

-Jack Kimball


My great uncle thought he had contracted Simonides
once. When the local folk remedies did not work, a
villager told him it was poetry from which he was
suffering. Can I get a commiserator? Where is that
confounded bridge? Kent Johnson knows the way to
Patmos. Fitts and Rexroth got nothing on Johnson, Kent
that is. The existing order alters yet again.

-Anastasios Kozaitis


Kent Johnson has provided us with yet another work of
profound unoriginality. The impossibility of pure
artifact is here flaunted expertly, lyrically,
orangely. The result is ‘classics’ fit for inscription

in your local Olive Garden* vomitorium. That many are
utterly beautiful poems is beside the point—right
beside it.

-Ben Lerner


These raunchy versions from the Greek are hard as
nails.  The collaboration between Kent Johnson &
Alexandra Papaditsas (the latter goat-horned due to a
“rare” condition) has produced a work as darkly
compelling as its origins are unlikely. Here the
evanescence which time lends the originals is
bracketed by fittingly modern intrusions.  The Greeks
have never sounded better, or funnier— yet the
strength of these poems lies as much in their
ineffability as their earthiness.  In Johnson’s
“Miseries,” new finds of papyri, and distant worlds,
are strangely audible.  “And strange beauty sings that
poetry is not bound by imitation.”

-Mark DuCharme


It’s good, in The Miseries of Poetry, to see the
Possible Fruition of lyric in Holderlin’s
definition—the continuous metaphor of a feeling—back
on an Actual Vine. The recognition that things have
lifetimes—including the circumstances that give rise
to poetry, poems, and all the entanglements between
these two and the “persons” comprising their subjects,
objects, etcetera—perpetuates a chaos that, like the
carnival atmosphere in “the right to comment” often
apparent in the clear address of many of these
translations, makes it peculiarly apt for our times,
its rush to vantage, power and judgment. Kent Johnson
creates a complex correspondence between the absolute
appearance of “poetry” and the completely fallible
tattered manuscripts, neurotic, and/or make-believe
translation partners, and near occult underparts of a
still archaic language (i.e., sex, rather than Greek)
that are then available for working across a widened
bandwidth of reference. It’s as if giving the poems
complex occasion anterior to their incrementally
mounting it in translation, makes their formal
delicacy and freshness—their talent to cause one to
jubilate and despond—by comparison that much more
fiercely clairvoyant, if that’s possible. Evidently,
it is.

-Stephen Ellis


After hiking all day across the desert I came at
nightfall, shivering, to the small heap that is
Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent Johnson's The Miseries
of Poetry.  It wasn't an oasis.  It wasn't even a
canteen.  It was more of a cactus, St. Sebastianed on
its own spines.  I was reminded of Baudelaire's
carcass.  Then the wreathy face of Auden.  Then Dante,
in a hood, turning away.  And I thought: how like the
Celts these ancient Greeks turn out to be.  At that
point, a red ant, an animate bead of extraordinary
delicacy, descended from the cactus and I left that
place, on my elbows and knees.

 -Mairead Byrne


The Miseries of Poetry is a wildly adventurous and
deeply engaging work.  Rough, tender, provocative,
certain of their own longing, these poems emanate the
shifting ground of voice layering voice layering voice
in rich textures rivaled only by the transformative
journey of the Camaroonian stink ant itself.  This
book illuminates some of the dark gaps from antiquity;
to read it is to bask in the shadowy brilliance
brought across centuries, brought upon this century,
preserved in papyrus and now . . . [partially gnawed
by moths] . . .

-George Kalamaras


Once I wrote a fake interview with John Ashbery, and
this caused some poets to become very anxious. Now I
am writing a fake blurb for the pathetically fake Kent
Johnson. But for the real keras of the real genius
Alexandra Papaditsas it is not a fake blurb at all.
Look at it. Take it. Curl your hand around its oily,
keratinous tube and move it up and down with great
rapidity. Scream, repeatedly, the name of Athena.

-Jacques Debrot


In The Miseries of Poetry, the reader is flung by a
catapult of rough hewn gods through a turbid and torch
lit night sky into an ancient Greek diorama. That the
lethal drip of cult-ure is pinched should come as a
welcomed shock. That this work is as obscene as it is
necessary, as tender as it is mordant, as hilarious as
it is conjured should send us reeling back into the
stacks of The Alexandrian Library.

-Andrew Felsinger


Classicists say that if you don't find an obscenity in
every line of Aristophanes, you're translating him
wrong.  Drawing upon that principle, Kent Johnson's
rollicking excesses of anal sadism, vulgarity and
bawdiness nonetheless make way to moments of
exceptional lyrical purity of the highest refinement.
Building upon evidence of authentic scholarship, even
when willfully boring or alienatingly scatological,
that purity has the unimpeachable foreignness and
integrity of a Greek satyr play's dull lewdness.  It's
remarkable how someone as well-read in current poetry
as he is has managed to escape all trace of the
homogenizing, mandatory styles that are dominant
today, to stake out his own irritating originality,
bathos, and penitence.

-Jeffrey Jullich


Dryden said, "If by traduction came thy mind, / Our
wonder is the less to find/ A soul so charming from a
stock so good," which describes the very antithesis of
the present work… There is no doubt that Alexandra
Papaditsas is a poet, but she is not a poet's poet.
She is no one's poet. Or maybe just a poet's poet's
poet. And Mr. Johnson, I suspect, is her lyre. Play
on, Mr. Johnson, remain in arms against our pathetic
rage for order. In rejecting poetry, in fucking poetry
spitefully and in striking poetry dead, you and Ms.
Papaditsas in your depraved consummation have
consummately revived it.

-Patrick Herron


Kent Johnson dedicates The Miseries of Poetry to his
son with fatherly advice—“Reject Poetry with all of
your might.” Clearly, instruction and entertainment
must follow. Johnson and Papaditsas construct from
fragments, holes, and anecdotes an assemblage they
call Traductions that colonize the contemporary ear &
set a place there, a locale. If all politics is, as
the bumper stickers say, local, then ditto for its
better, poetry. It’s a hard code, but traditional to
veggie cults (no strangers to the classical world), to
hold the City-Founder responsible for the City’s woes.
The voice behind the poems is responsible for the
resulting city of voices, & to the speaker falls the
sacrificial role. His hide must purify the city of its
ills. So mama, don’t let your babies grow up to be
poets. If you do, it’s likely, as Lacan is rumored to
have said of Artaud, that they will become “blue and
stiff as a kite in a Chinese wind.”

-Carl Thayler


If all is translated, and moreover, if everything
exists as a fragment of something larger and unknown,
then whence comes our knowledge, and not only our
knowledge, but also our bases for certainty?  These
traductions by Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent Johnson
intimate that not only is there a maker, but there
also exists an antimaker, who is not necessarily
malicious, but necessary nonetheless in instilling
wonder and imagination before both what is seen and
unseen.  Being such, of course, this text is
guaranteed to raise suspicion and leave one unsettled;
however, the reader will be good to note George
Steiner’s notion that there exists “in every act of
translation—and specially where it succeeds—a touch of
treason.”  If our wits are entirely informed by our
surmises (i.e. our translating the world around us),
and if our surmises are impeded by the fragmentary
nature of whatever history it is we inherit, then this
text, humorous and beautiful yet sneering and
imploring, demonstrates how these seeming “holes”
allow us to see into some sort of truth.

-Jenny Boully


"I is a monkey's other," laments an uprooted Ovid from
his tree house in exile. While a fashionably scarred
Friedrick's of Holderlin tearfully declaims:
"Language, the most dangerous of goods, has been given
to man, so that in creating, destroying and perishing,
and then returning to the ever-living, he may witness
what he is." Whereupon every critic's heartthrob
Emmanuel Blanchot secures the third swift strike to
the bloody core of this post-dialectical pin cushion:
"Being is the impossibility of being anything for the
first time." We thus are drawn by the ineluctable
patterns of inference to declare that Miseries is
unquestionably the most astonishing purloining of
letters since raven-headed Poe himself descended
into the whirling maelstrom of delirium and brought
forth reason's fatal temptation upon his broken back.

-Mark W. Palmer


Having been caught myself at things Greek, I could
hardly refuse Mr. Johnson’s request for a blurb to The
Miseries of Poetry. I suppose my role here is to say
two things: 1) These are marvelous pieces of art and
collapsed time, and 2) Although it might seem too
fantastic to believe, I knew Ms. Papaditsas, and knew
her fairly well. Do not assume that all that is here
is invention or forgery. The full story is much more
complicated. Including who killed her.

-David Solway


How many times has Kent Johnson read Pale Fire?  I
forgive him for stealing my Armand Schwerner
collection, but this audacious performance is
something else entirely.  Rumor has it that St. John
of Patmos was given to delusions brought on by
inadvertent ergot consumption. The result was a
great revelation. One might conjecture that Kent
Johnson is given to delusions brought on by
intentional consumption of synthetic ergot-derived
tablets. Much, too, is revealed in The Miseries of
Poetry. The delights here are too numerous to
enumerate, but they leave me numb and purple, like my
_______ after a session of robust ________ with
________.  But that's not really the point. The point
is this: these are weird little translations, as
beautiful and disturbing as Alexandra Papaditsas was
horny.

-Anthony Robinson


Moving with the wit and elegance of a purveyor of
marginally fresh taramosalata, Kent Johnson has
elevated the literary grift to an art form. The result
is a collection as timeless and ecstatic as an
eight-track of Nana Mouskouri B-sides.

-Bill Freind


A is D; B is C. The catapult on which Ammonides laid
Theorphrastus is now released, and all the daily
objects are exactly in their situations in the
artist’s room. So what if the room is in the Museum?
The Museum, too, has a hole in its roof, blown outward
from within, no different than a sheaf of decayed
papyrus. The poet’s body is a projectile. Nothing can
stop the upward force of History.

-Dmitri Prigov


Kent Johnson weaves an electrifying tapestry of poetic
tradition through a vitriolic translation in a spirit
close to Nikola Tesla's strange poem "Fragments of
Olympian Gossip." The experience of this work will
generate a catastrophic ripple effect on the poetic
community. This is truly the gods’ way of saying "Buy
American."

-Geoffrey Gatza


Yes, I remember well that day in Axel's.  It was
December 15, 1977, and we had been sitting in the back
booth celebrating the semester's end with pitchers of
beer.  As we entered the third hour, I recall leaning
towards Kent and saying, "You'll have to slide out of
the booth.  I know it's going to be hard for you, but
I've got a wicked piss.  Will you try?"  Given the
state he was in, it's not surprising that he has
misremembered my words to fit his own obscure poetic
purposes on this occasion.

-James Chapson


A field report from the prehistory of the SCA? Johnson
either proves that the sins of omission are
constituitive authorities or that candor is the
brightest shield we'll ever know apart from privacy.
Too enthusiastic to be textual tourism, The Miseries
of Poetry upends the sideshow mummy circuit for big
tent imagineering, where it's impossible to read
what's an aside and what's a show. Our translator-hero
plays celebrity coroner Thomas Noguchi to one Elmer J.
McCurdy after another...all in togas! The result is
somewhere between Petronian hip and ramshackle Char.
I'm sh-sh-shattered.

-Andrew Maxwell


All who care about our current poetry and its
red-headed step-twin, translation, know of Kent
Johnson, and follow his work with interest and
pleasure, but there is something in his work that I
admire particularly: He is without a doubt the only
poet among us who, firstly, really understands what
Fernando Pessoa did, and, secondly, is really doing
something about it. What a ravishing book this is!
These haunted translations are welcome proof of what I
believe to be one of Kent Johnson's greatest gifts,
which is his ability to cause uncomfortable
silences in our small, partisan, chronically envious
minds. In some of us, these silences have led to
disgust; such unlovely creatures among us can be
pitied, but they should not be allowed to matter. I
can think of no current poetry more beautiful, no
poetics more radically necessary, no critical attitude
more bracing, no sense of humor deeper or more humane.
We should, in spite of ourselves, be grateful for his
combative presence in our complacent midst.

-Chris Daniels


The Miseries of Poetry is looking for hosts in the
shape of readers to propagate its vision of language's
glorious life cycle. Reader, are you ready? These
translations are fresh as hot, steaming shit.

-Murat Nemet-Nejat


I am having second thoughts about Kent Johnson.  My
first were these:

“Reader, be wary. KJ is a known liar. He grabs onto
the ideals and idols that political communities and
communities of identity hold sacred and claims them as
his invention. He has no shame, he’ll bring great
French thinkers, colonized ants (that would be
colonized colonizers) and even his child into this
mix, a mix into which he splices arcane bodies of
knowledge, with lines and ingredients from the labels
of processed food. This, which he calls poetry.  To be
kind, (which I’m not sure Mr. Johnson is, for I don’t
know him, though something tells me he has sweetheart
qualities) these perverse lies flow with an infective
music, humor, SEX and suspicious scholarship, as the
liar KJ seems intent to interconnect all things
including past and present, mortal and spiritual, East
and West, and ugh! female male.”   . . . at which
point a different spirit seized me, that my flip use
of the word liar was, though intended as playful, a
dangerous feed to those propagandists and manipulators
of power who claim Truth as some absolute, though what
is called Truth are selections from the spectacle
useful in propping their power to pursue us meek
seeklings of that-which-is-otherwise, whose product
crosses and poses threat to the rippling mirages and
echoes that assure them.  I empathize with KJ.  Like
him I bitterly regret this meekness, while knowing, as
my friend Peter Neufeld repeats, “a poet must never,
never, enter a duel.”  Bravo Kent Johnson, your
traductions, and your identities, adopted and blood,
your battles, be they not duels.  Live as long as you
can.

-Rachel Levitsky


I got drunk with Kent Johnson in Monroe, Wisconsin,
and I'm one of the publishers of this book. So maybe
those two things will disqualify anything I say here.
But for the record, which erases itself every 15
seconds, these little Miseries are to die for.
Translated with Alexandra Papaditsas, these Greek
fragments vibrate with renewed life. This isn't
accomplished by the translators' genius, but by way of
language's continued metamorphosis of life into form.
What is translation, after all, but an attention to
language that seeks to release the unknown from a
tyrant otherness?  I ask, dear reader, what is truth
if Art can’t show what lies beneath the sludge of self
and time? Perhaps here, for a few moments, we may
indulge in a fantasy of psychic passage. Here are
little sparks, illuminations, showing us of the
afterlife that surrounds us.

-Dale Smith

Kent Johnson's still here, plonking the daily dailies,
thinking how inert and typical a finished book
actually looks. These kinds of poems could hardly have
been made in Freeport, Illinois in a burst of
reluctant enthusiasm on a porch overlooking the
post-millenial street. And weren't. Or so one can
imagine. And you Hellenophiliae, don't be doing the
"What ya doin' _that_ for, hunh?" Read the sincerity
through the witlessness here, and stoop to honor no
one. Yea, it's a kick-ass collection, and the body
of work gets gummed and lamed and bespattered in the
process.

-John Latta


To the old metaphysical debate, whether a hole is
something or nothing, I want to add, after reading
this book, a third opinion: it is almost everything.
Gnosticism is powerfully revived, both in contents and
form, after centuries of oblivion. Kent Johnson has
surpassed himself (and nobody else has surpassed him)
in inoculating the  mundane  holiness and mystical
holes of  other cultures, Japanese and Greek,  to the
tree of English poetry.

-Mikhail Epstein

Battlefield Is A Showcase for Defense Firms
Arms Exporters Could Thrive On Televised Success in Iraq

By Renae Merle
Washington Post Staff Writer

After years of development and testing, a weapon proves its value only
during "cold, hard combat," said Joel L. Johnson, vice president of
international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association. "You don't
know how it's going to perform in large numbers until you put it in the
hands of those 19- and 20-year-old" soldiers, he said.

Kevin:

Thank you for the article. Confirms what many of us have
been saying just this all along. And it should
come as a surprise: Hitler perfected his destruction
in Franco's Spain. And, more to the current point:
After years of dressing down the Clintontonian Régime
 for going soft on D-E-F-E-N-S-E (which, after, the
fiasco in Belgrade, is not an argument), certainly the
OLD GUARD has itchy trigger-fingers to try out
new-improved ordinance. No surprise at all...

Yes, as many of us have long said: there's many, many
reasons for this war...

Release Party for Across the Line/Al otro lado: the Poetry of Baja California
Cosponsored with and held at the Poetry Center, San Francisco State
University, 1600 Holloway, San Francisco
Join us as we celebrate the release of this new Junction Press anthology,
edited by Harry Polkinhorn & Mark Weiss. "...the poets are always interesting,
and sometimes astounding. Like many Mexican poets of the 20th/21st centuries,
they owe a deep debt to Neruda and Mistral. But the rigors of Paz and the sly
dryness of Jose Emilio Pacheco are also greatly in evidence. These aren't
rustic slouches ? these are poets engaged in the art, wrestling with
structuralism, postmodernism, minimalism, surrealism. One wonders where Juan
Reynas, Esali, Jose Javier Villarreal, Julieta Irigoyen, to name a few, have
been all these years.... My dear Baja is waiting to take its proper place as
the center of the literary map." -- Luis Alberto Urrea, San Diego Union

Cassie Lewis is the author of High Country (Little Esther, 2001) and Winter
District (Potes and Poets, 2002). Originally from Melbourne, Australia, she
moved to the Bay Area in 2000. Her poetry has been widely published in
Australia, as well as in England, New Zealand and the U.S. -- most recently in
Tinfish, Overland, Shampoo, Famous Reporter, Jacket and Southerly. Brydie
McPherson is the author of Abandon's Garden (EtherDome, 2000). McPherson is a
local -- a graduate of the MFA program at San Francisco State, her work has

A bit of synchronicity (gosh, remember when people really used that word?
Carl Jung, where are you?) causes me to forward this book notice from Z Net.

A few nights ago a friend told me of an "Annotation" in the March *Harper's*
about the activities of the IMF and World Bank in Argentina that he said was
the best such thing he'd read in a magazine. So I checked it out -- quite
informative -- and noted it was prepared by one Greg Palast.

Then, this morning, as I was driving to work, this same Greg Palast was
being interviewed on my local NPR station in Seattle, KUOW. He was talking
mainly about his investigations into the stolen election of 2000 . . . where
all this sordid tale began.

And THEN . . . in today's e-mail, was this nugget from ZNet. As chains of
coincidence are one of the things I follow, I thought it might be worth a
forward.

Joe Safdie

---
The Best Democracy Money Can Buy
By Greg Palast.

     Palast's new book, the new US edition of, The Best Democracy
     Money Can Buy, has been rising up the New York Times
     bestseller list since it's release last month. Katherine Harris
     calls Greg Palast, "twisted and maniacal," but in Britain he's
     known as "the most important investigative reporter of our time"
     (Tribune Magazine). Despite breaking some of the decade's biggest
     stories (the theft of the elections in Florida, Enron's machinations,
     the real story of the coup d'etat in Venezuela and more) - this
     LA-born journalist's work has been all but banned in the USA ...
     except in ZNet which first brought his writings for the Guardian
     and BBC to America.

1) Can you tell ZNet, please, what your new book, The Best Democracy Money
Can Buy, is about? What is it trying to communicate?

It's about the Bushes and the billionaires that love them. It's about a War
Hero President who got the 'top gun' job in the Texas Toy Airforce with a
call from his congressman daddy who was so quick to send other men's sons to
take the bullets. It's about a coup d'etat by computer - the details of how
we at BBC TV uncovered the nasty little purge list of 57,700 voters that
Kate Harris flushed from the voter roles on grounds they were felons - when
they were only guilty of voting while Black.

There's nine chapters in the new US edition of this book - all my reports
from BBC and The Guardian updated - blocked from the US airwaves by the
electronic Berlin Wall. It includes the latest installment of the story that
won the Project Censored award for my Guardian/BBC team: "Did Bush Spike the
Investigation of Bin Laden?" And then there's the story of Poppy Bush's
blood-soaked little gold-mining operation - founded by Adnan Khasshoggi.

In other words, it's a very funny book. If you've read Stupid White Men,
these are the reports behind many of Moore's killer essays. And now it's in
paperback so you can easily carry around occupied Baghdad.

2) Can you tell ZNet something about writing the book? Where does the
content come from? What went into making the book what it is?

What it's based on is old-fashioned investigative reporting - a mixture of
Edward R. Murrow and Lt. Columbo. There's the photos of Harris' elections
chief fleeing from my camera crew (Chapter 1: 'Jim Crow in Cyberspace.') I
used disguises and false business fronts to find out how Enron and other
American power pirates bought out the governments of Texas, California,
Brazil and England (Chapter 3: California Reamin').

My chapter on globalization ("Sell the Lexus, Burn the Olive Tree.") take a
wee bit different view than found in Thomas Friedman's hand job for the New
World Order. In this chapter, you'll see documents marked "Secret" and
"Confidential" from the locked file cabinets of the World Bank and IMF - the
detailed plans for financially disembowling Argentina, Tanzania and Bolivia.


And there's my undercover investigation of the crazed cleric of the
Christian Coalition (Chapter 5, "Pat Robertson, General Pinochet, Pepsi Cola
and the Anti-Christ"). And just for the hell of it, I take a journalistic
leak on Heartland America (Chapter 7: "Small Towns, Small Minds.")

3) What are your hopes for The Best Democracy Money Can Buy? What do you
hope it will contribute or achieve, politically? Given the effort and
aspirations you have for the book, what will you deem to be a success? What
would leave you happy about the whole undertaking? What would leave you
wondering if it was worth all the time and effort?

The book's on the New York Times bestseller list, so my deeply hidden craven
capitalist urges have been satisfied. But, as a pinhead potentate C-student
from Yale once said, "I will not stop until the people are liberated from
the tyrant."

You can view Palast's reports for BBC Television's Newsnight and his columns
for the Guardian papers of London at http://www.gregpalast.com/. The new,
expanded US edition of The Best Democracy Money Can Buy: An Investigative
Reporter Exposes the Truth About Globalization, Corporate Cons and
High-Finance Fraudsters is published by Plume/Penguin.

If Katherine Harris
     calls Greg Palast, "twisted and maniacal," then I'm certain the book is
excellent. Everything I've read by him up to now I have respected.  Thanks

Hello everyone

Just reminding everyone that the deadline is coming up for the
Banner-Strike Contest, a joint project of the Banner Art Collective
(http://bannerart.org/) and Velvet-Strike
(http://www.opensorcery.net/velvet-strike/).

Banner-Strike is a contest for digital graffiti and net.art that is
created under specific limitations and which critically examines the
war in Iraq.  All entries will be displayed in bannerart.org's ongoing
banner art exhibition and also turned into a Velvet-Strike spray (to be
installed in Counter-Strike).  The winner of the contest will win the
October 2003 release of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and will be
highlighted on the front page of both sites for one month.

The deadline for submissions is 16 April, 2003.  The winner will be
announced on 18 April, 2003.

- Technical Requirements -

Submitted banners need to be in gif or jpeg/jpg format with no animation.
All of the following sizes are acceptable: 234x60, 88x31, 120x60, 120x240,
125x125, 240x400, 300x250, 336x280 and 250x250. To submit, go to
bannerart.org and use the submission form upload your work for review.
Please mark in the "special requirements" field on the upload form that
your submission is for the contest and not just for normal entry to the
site's continuing banner art exhibition, submissions for which are
continuing as usual.

All entries will be shrunk proportionally and converted to a spray paint
.wad file by the creators of Velvet-Strike. You can do this conversion
yourself to test how your work might look, by downloading the freeware
application "Wally 1.55b" on the "Counterspray" site
(http://www.counterspray.com/makeyourown.htm). Below is the list of
conversion sizes that will be used:

234x60 half-banner->192x48
88x31 microbar->96x32 (with a transparent border)
120x60 button->96x48
120x240 button->64x128
125x125 button->96x96

Linguistic Reformulation:
Forthcoming Challenges in a Democratic Occupied Iraq

(Gothic News Service, 5/08)  The White House today announced the formal
creation of  "Lang-Ops," a joint division of State and War Departments with
a direct mandate to take charge of the reconstruction of the Arabic languag=
e
in Occupied Democratic Iraq.

"No, this is not an ethnocentric exercise, nor one of political
manipulation," Brad Stevens, the new Lang-Ops Director responded at a news
conference to an Arab reporter=B9s question. "This is all about
re-invigorating Gulf Spoken Arabic with old and sound Mediterranean values
of trade, commerce and opportunity. Like Iraq=B9s damaged oil fields and
cities, Lang-Ops' most exciting task is to restructure Arabic to take full
advantage of new technologies and business models that have fueled the
success of western economies. On a most simple level, Lang-Ops will
introduce the Arabic version of English words and phrases that will operate
as catalytic agents in the goal of integrating Iraqi national aspirations
with global economic interests."

   When asked if this meant bringing business and other teachers from the
United States to work in Iraq=B9s economic institutes and universities, the
Director replied, "Of course. Fortunately our country is currently abundant
and available with former business executives who are entirely advanced in
introducing and using the language and tools of potentially prosperous
economies. Power Point, Excel =AD for example - and other computer programs
are already being revamped for bilingual Arabic and English classes - both
on-site in Iraq and on-line. Conceptually our Lang-Ops staff members have
already been very busy creating correspondent Arabic language terms to
stimulate an aggressive sense and use of concepts for "brand identity",
"traction", "critical mass", and other terms for multiple micro-market
global domination. You have to realize Iraq is a country that=B9s been more o=
r
less out of it for over thirty years."

   "What about the language of democracy =AD values of free speech, consent o=
f
the governed, public assembling, voting, honoring foreign agreements,
religious freedom, those kinds of things."

   "First and foremost is to introduce the English-Arab terms for purposes
of Iraq economic stimulus. This process is not much different than
reconstructing an oil well and instituting a new management to control its
world financial and delivery operations. Without the stimulus of a rebuilt
Arabic in a way that  represents economic opportunity for the liberated,
old-fashioned democratic values are not worth a dime. In other words an
Occupied Iraq first requires linguistic reformulation in a manner forceful
enough to assure integration with our world=B9s economic interests. Success
there will permit the evolution of democratic Arabic language values. I
think you will also find our linguistic success will lead to the mitigation
of resistance from certain religious and other counter-democratic forces."

   The Lang-Ops Director went on to say that both State and War Departments
are actively recruiting its first what will be called "Business Language
Mentors (BLMs)" in both Silicon Valley and its counter-part in
Massachusetts. "The executive talent pool in the High-Tech sector is
particularly deep right now," the Director said without explanation. "We
will have no trouble filling our Iraq Mentor Sites. Lang-Ops looks forward
to an aggressive Arabic language reconstruction program."

   Director Stevens refused to respond to a question as nothing but
"offensive" when another Arab reporter asked whether or not Lang-Ops was
part of an over-all State and War Department strategy to "re-cradle Arab
civilization, including the origins of the Muslim faith."

Saadi Youssef's poem goes to the heart of the nightmarishness of this war and
the moral position of America in it.
Thanks Scott.

Maybe the Langpos could do some Lang-Ops on the old some to be ancien regime
here?
I hear the "hardballers" have Frenchified arms caches into cachets if my
hearing hasn't gone competely?
Maybe we should toss all the newspeak and adthink back under the Tower of
Babel and start from scratch

Ron, Ieby was the fourth "young poet" who read with me, Jim Koller, and
David Schaff. I take it that the tape of that reading has disappeared? It
was a reading set up before the conference began, thrru the good graces of
Richard Baker. Most of the Big Guns were present.
  But the character you disocvered the other day spells "Scharf" I think it
was, differently, and his first name isnt his, it's David. I dunno why
theres no tape of this event. But believe you me, it happened. I can still
see David Schaff's red pants and red and wfiire check shirt and red jacket.
      He helped Loewinsohn, me, and Sherril Jaffe edit R.C.Lion, whose third
issue had two versions of RD's poem "Masturbation"  poem. There were also
poems by Ted Berrigan, Don Schenker, Anselm Hollo, and the four of us, along
with RD and others my stroke-messed-up brain cant now recall (but may
tomorrow, or sooner, if I can hunt those three issues up). Loewinsohn read
at the conference too--I csnt recall with whom.
       Happy Days--filled w/ persons and rvents. zi went to Bkly for a
Cody's reading just this Sunday--Richard Denner and Lou Garcia, two more
from the fringe who still write and publish. There were people in the
audience I hadnt seen in nearly 40 years.  years. James Schevill, for
instance, now in a wheelchair, legs paralyzed by a stroke, but still
somewhat able to speak. The "Flash" person officiating was our old chum
Richard Whatshisname. He has become politer, nicer, but his ironic nature
has made him more thuglike. I felt alienated, despite my liking for Denner's
recent work. Where are all you guys?  Love, David

Here is the whole poem; it's title is "America, America."  Nicole=20

Sa=92adi Youssef : America, America

God save America
My home sweet home!

The French general who raised his tricolour
over Nugrat al-Salman where I was a prisoner thirty
years ago ...
in the middle of that U-turn that split the back of the Iraqi army,
the general who loved St Emilion wines
called Nugrat al-Salman a fort=85
Of the surface of the earth, generals know only two
dimensions:
Whatever rises is a fort
whatever spreads is a battlefield.
How ignorant the general was!
But Liberation was better versed in topography.
The Iraqi boy who conquered her front page
sat carbonised behind a steering wheel
on the Kuwait-Safwan highway
while television cameras
(the booty of the defeated and their identity)
were safe in the truck like a storefront
on Rivoli Street.
The neutron bomb is highly intelligent,
it distinguishes between
an "I" and an "Identity".

How long will I walk to reach my home
How long will I walk to reach my girl
How long must I walk to Sacramento

I too love jeans and jazz and Treasure Island
and John Silver's parrot and the terraces of New Orleans
I love Mark Twain and the Mississippi steamboats
     and Abraham Lincoln's dogs
I love the fields of wheat and corn and the smell of
Virginia tobacco.
But I am not American. Is that enough for the
Phantom pilot to turn me back to the Stone Age!
I need neither oil, nor America herself, neither the
elephant nor the donkey.
Leave me, pilot, leave my house roofed with palm
fronds and this wooden bridge.
I need neither your Golden Gate nor your
skyscrapers.
I need the village not New York.
Why did you come to me from your Nevada desert,
    soldier armed to the teeth?

Why did you come all the way to distant Basra
where fish used to swim by our doorsteps.
Pigs do not forage here. I only have these water
buffaloes lazily chewing on water lilies.
Leave me alone soldier. Leave me my floating cane hut and my fishing
spear.
Leave me my migrating birds and the green plumes.
Take your roaring iron birds and your Tomahawk
missiles. I am not your foe.
I am the one who wades up to the knees in rice
paddies.
Leave me to my curse. I do not need your day of doom.

God save America
My home sweet home!

America
let us exchange your gifts.
Keep your smuggled cigarettes
give us potatoes.
Keep James Bond's golden pistol
give us Marilyn Monroe's giggle.=09
Keep the heroin syringe under the tree
give us vaccines.
Keep your blueprints for model penitentiaries
give us village homes.
Keep the books of your missionaries
give us paper for poems to defame you.
Keep what you do not have
give us what we have.
Keep the stripes of your flag
give us the stars.

Keep the Afghani Mujahideen's beard
  give us Walt Whitman's beard filled with
     butterflies.
Keep Saddam Hussain
give us Abraham Lincoln
or give us no one.

Now as I look across the balcony
across the summer sky, the summery summer
Damascus spins, dizzied among television aerials
then it sinks, deeply, in the stories of the forts
and towers
and the arabesques of ivory
and sinks, deeply, from cornerstones of faith
then disappears from the balcony.

And now I remember trees:
the date palm of our mosque in Basra, at the end of
Basra
the bird's beak
and a child's secret
a summer feast.
I remember the date palm.
I touch it. I become it, when it falls black without
fronds
when  a dam fell hewn by lightning.
And I remember the mighty mulberry
when it rumbled, butchered with an axe ...
to fill the stream with leaves
and birds
and angels
and green blood.
I remember when pomegranate blossoms covered
    the sidewalks,
the students were leading the workers' parade ...

The trees die
pummelled
dizzied,
not standing
the trees die.


God save America
My home sweet home!

We are not hostages, America
and your soldiers are not God's soldiers ...
We are the poor ones, ours is the earth of the

drowned  gods
the gods of bulls
the gods of fires
the gods of sorrows that intertwine clay and blood
in a song ...
We are the poor, ours is the god of the poor
who emerges out of the farmers' ribs
hungry and bright
and raises heads up high ...
America, we are the dead
Let your soldiers come
Whoever kills a man, let him resurrect him
We are the drowned  ones, dear lady

We are the drowned
Let the water come



Damascus, 20 August 1995

Just published! New titles from NOMADOS by Dodie Bellamy and Daphne
Marlatt.

Fat Chance  by Dodie Bellamy.  ISBN 0-9731521-3-3. 38pp.
$12.00 plus $2.50 post&packing.
                In this writing it's like Dodie Bellamy's being
questioned by 12 detectives. They are talking over one another so
naturally her voice assumes 12 simultaneous registers, each very
endearing but still hot. After she recites her collected works the
detectives are willing to forgive everything. They only want to sleep
with her.
                                Cedar Sigo
                Bellamy's Fat Chance is pellucid, masterful prose, at
once a bodiceful of grainy secrets, a set of falsities, and a treasury
of urbane/innocent candor. To her, against eternity, I raise a glass of
stingo! There are many reasons I read Bellamy, not least for the
rapidity of insight, mediumistic spirt, and her enormous, at times
jocular, tenderness.
                                Lissa Wolsak

Seven Glass Bowls by Daphne Marlatt. ISBN 0-9731521-5-X  23 pp.
$10.00 plus $2.50  post&packing.

                "Home and the closeness of the beloved," she writes.
There can be no subject as important to the poet and the rest of us, and
in this lovely poem, Daphne Marlatt continuously achives her best yet
"homing in." That present participle is our sweet clue to a mystery we
are encouraged to enter. Gladly.

Still Available from Nomados

A Thousand Mornings.  Prose poems about daily life in Vancouver's oldest
neighbourhood by Meredith Quartermain. ISBN 0-9731521-2-5. 89 pp.
$14.00 plus $2.50 post&packing.

                Morning.  Peck at silence, dark, rage, death's mosaic.
Demand liver.  Vomit back minarets on the streets of sense.  Believe we
can hide for a time.  Believe these engines fly.  Blackened mirror of
sky.  Tar it.  Stick to it.  Open.  To gulls.  Flayed open.  Wrench the
wrists, ankles, body in the suck of tar.  Black tongues of mirror.
Listen.  Small steeples line our streets.  Small sacred hearts.
                                [from A Thousand Mornings]

Wanders.   Nineteen poems by Robin Blaser  with nineteen responses by
Meredith Quartermain. ISBN 0-9731521-0-9  39pp.
$10.00 plus $2.50 post&packing.

Do
                you spend most of your time
the winds breathe in a gist
                digging in hearts?

Hey gang, I'm poking my head out of the bunker just long enough to
get a question out:

I was talking with a person who works for a university based print
literary journal. It came up that funding is at a record low (no surprize
there) and they're looking for new ideas on generating income.

So, are there any interesting things going on out there, generating
income for literary journals?

Best,
  JG

Soome of the things I snd my friends tried over the years have included (1)
getting a really hotshot poet to do a free reading, while letting us charge
$5 a head  (2) get secondhand books donated by everyone you know, then hold
a big booksale (3) ripping off your dept. for printing materials and
processing (Ah, but it would be wrong!)  (5) Have a big bake sale  (6)
everyone donates clothes for clothing sale.
   Best of luck and try to stay out of jail!   David B

literary journal. It came up that funding is at a record low (no surprize
there) and they're looking for new ideas on generating income.

So, are there any interesting things going on out there, generating
income for literary journals?

Best,

Fury at US as attacks kill three journalists
Al-Jazeera quits Iraq as Americans accused over deaths

Wednesday April 9, 2003
The Guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,932809,00.html


The Arab satellite television channel al-Jazeera is to
pull its reporters out of Iraq after one of them was
killed during a US air raid on Baghdad.

"I cannot guarantee anyone's safety," the news editor,
Ibrahim Hillal, told reporters. "We still have four
reporters in Baghdad, we will pull them out. We have one
embedded with US forces in Nassiriya; we want to pull him
out."

The move followed a day in which three journalists were
killed by US fire in separate attacks in Baghdad, leading
to accusations that US forces were targeting the news
media.

Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk, 35, was killed when an
American tank fired a shell directly at the Reuters suite
on the 15th floor at the Palestine hotel, where many
journalists are staying.

Jose Couso, 37, a cameraman for the Spanish television
channel Tele 5, was wounded in the same attack and died
later in hospital. Samia Nakhoul, the Gulf bureau chief of
Reuters, was also injured, along with a British
technician, Paul Pasquale, and an Iraqi photographer,
Faleh Kheiber.

Earlier, al-Jazeera cameraman Tarek Ayyoub, a 35-year-old
Palestinian who lived in Jordan, was killed when two bombs
dropped during a US air raid hit the satellite station's
office in the Iraqi capital.

American forces also opened fire on the offices of Abu
Dhabi television, whose identity is spelled out in large
blue letters on the roof.

All the journalists were killed and injured in daylight at
locations known to the Pentagon as media sites. The tank
shell that hit the Palestine hotel slammed into the
18-storey building at noon, shaking the tower and spewing
rubble and dirt into hotel rooms at least six floors
below.

The attack brought pandemonium in the hotel which lies on
the east side of the Tigris. It was adopted by all
remaining western journalists in the city after advice
from the Pentagon to evacuate from the western side of the
river.

Central command in Qatar said its troops had been
responding in self-defence to enemy fire but witnesses
dismissed that claim as false. According to a central
command statement, "commanders on the ground reported that
coalition forces received significant enemy fire from the
hotel and consistent with the inherent right of
self-defence, coalition forces returned fire".

The statement added: "Sadly a Reuters and Tele 5
journalist were killed in this exchange. These tragic
incidents appear to be the latest example of the Iraqi
regime's continued strategy of using civilian facilities
for military purposes."

But journalists in the hotel insisted there had been no
Iraqi fire.

Sky's correspondent, David Chater, said: "I never heard a
single shot coming from the area around here, certainly
not from the hotel," he said.

BBC correspondent Rageh Omaar added that none of the other
journalists in the hotel had heard any sniper fire.

Chater said he saw a US tank pointing its gun at the hotel
and turned away just before the blast. "I noticed one of
the tanks had its barrel pointed up at the building. We
went inside and there was an almighty crash. That tank
shell, if it was an American tank shell, was aimed
directly at this hotel and directly at journalists. This
wasn't an accident. It seems to be a very accurate shot."

Geert Linnebank, Reuters editor-in-chief, said the
incident "raises questions about the judgment of the
advancing US troops who have known all along that this
hotel is the main base for almost all foreign journalists
in Baghdad".

Journalists, a watchdog group that defends press freedoms,
demanded an invesigation in a letter to the US defence
secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. "We believe these attacks
violate the Geneva conventions," the letter said, adding
that even if US forces had been fired on from the
Palestine hotel "the evidence suggests that the response
of US forces was disproportionate and therefore violated
humanitarian law".

During the Afghan war, two supposedly smart US bombs hit
the Reuters office in Kabul and many suspect the attack
was no accident. It happened at a strategic moment, two
hours before the Northern Alliance took over the city.

US military officials at central command said they were
investigating and added that the casualties were
"regrettable". "We know that we don't target journalists,"
said Brigadier General Vince Brooks, deputy director of
operations.

Al-Jazeera correspondent Tarek Ayyoub was broadcasting
live to the satellite station's 7am news bulletin when US
aircraft fired two missiles at the bureau building,
killing him and injuring a colleague. Two Iraqi staff are
missing.

Ibrahim Hilal, al-Jazeera's chief editor at its
headquarters in Qatar, said a US warplane was seen above
the building before the attack. "Witnesses saw the plane
fly over twice before dropping the bombs. Our office is in
a residential area and even the Pentagon knows its
location," he said.

Al-Jazeera correspondent Majed Abdul-Hadi said the
bombardment was probably deliberate.

In Doha last night al-Jazeera's chairman, Hamad bin
Thamer, said the channel "could not ascertain" if its
Baghdad bureau had been targeted by the US. But he
dismissed American claims that there had been gunfire
coming from the building at the time of the attack.

"This was absolutely and categorically denied by other
reporters and our reporters present on the ground," he
said.

Mr Ayyoub, 35, a Palestinian born in Kuwait, had not
intended to go to Baghdad but as the war dragged on he
felt he had to work there, and al-Jazeera agreed to let
him work in Baghdad.

His widow, Dima Ayyoub, launched a vitriolic attack on
America: "My message to you is that hatred breeds hatred,"
she said in a live telephone link-up from her home in
Amman, Jordan. "I cannot see where is the cleanness in
this war. All I see is blood, destruction and shattered
hearts. The US said it was a war against terrorism. Who is
committing terrorism now?"

No, no.  I have it on good authority that they were

meditation by allen bramhall

saddam is tribal and secular, not particularly religious. that's what we
have failed to understand as americans. instead we have lumped all under the
heading of 'muslim' and have succeeded in what saddam and bin laden couldn't
do- uniting the arabs under one banner, that of muslims. we've succeeded in
pushing moderate arabs into the radical camp and radical arabs into the
militant camp.we've decided to take down what we don't approve of and
rebuild it in our own image.

the arrogance of this is unbelievable. and the world will not forgive us
this. and they shouldn't.

All music is a study of liquid. For those who wait
behind windows, watching the world catch green and
burst into cacophony, the study of music is also a
phenomenology of reflection; you enter the water by
peering into it, seeing your form slide across its
unceasing motion:  this is how you photograph her,
peripherally. A fluid scholarship positions a cinch of
pain that fades over the margins of my voice.  She
draws stars from my heart, sparks of droplets, rain
catching fire in this new refusal to fall blindly, to
bend around the parameters of her motion until the
room spins away. Where can a room such as this go on
similar mornings?

The Tipping Point/ a new poem

The "tipping point" has been reached,
Baghdad butcher's palaces breached.
Between solid gold faucets and faux
Liberation, an exhaustion, runs: awe

Less than shock, how, from Georgia,
Wisconsin, boys could extend this far
With depleted supply lines, uranium,
Only to shoot an armless kid, his mum,

Journalists, and a blind guy bicycling;
It hurts beyond any line: action-killing,
24-7 - in the name of Kingdom Come;
I would rather we sent war to Heaven

Than brought our peace to their city.
A little late, or opportune, to pity them,
Then mandate either UN or Coalition
Rule; the streets have loose kings out,

Order's hem unravelling; we address
Words like Government, Freedom
At our own risk, cluster meanings
Littering sense's ground.  Mr. Fisk

Witness, reporter, has seen murder
Done, by Americans lounging about
With post-conquest Marlboros, smirks
On fresh digital dream faces.  It works.

the number of voters who turned out for Clinton/Gore's 2nd term was lower
than it was for the 1st term

many have argued that it was due to the fact that Clinton/Gore had the 2nd
term in the bag for lack of vital competition

while this is true in some cases there were many of us who had had ENOUGH
of the previous 4 years of snake charming and REFUSED to vote for
Clinton/Gore EVER AGAIN

so when Ralph Nader and Wynona LaDuke came along--just as Al Gore was
readying himself for another snack--those of us who had NO INTEREST in
voting for Al Gore in the first place had our NEW man and woman

Nader and LaDuke's platform was a lifetime's accumulation of chilling
information about America's various insatiable appetites

and no one better than the poor truly understood the deceit of Clinton/Gore

Al Gore himself gave a speech in Philadelphia some years ago at the
Presidential Summit PASSIONATELY insisting that welfare mothers will
feel more fulfilled when their benefits are cut off and--in many cases--
are forced to take buses many miles from home to work minimum wage
jobs while their children fend for themselves

Clinton/Gore saw nothing wrong with the public education system being
determined by property tax which of course had NOTHING to do with the
imbalance of education standards (yeah, right) which of course had NOTHING
to do with the imbalance of livable life and work skills (yeah, right)

it wasn't just the poor but the working poor and working class who SUFFERED
and continue to SUFFER from the Clinton/Gore legacy of NAFTA

there was NO courage in the Clinton/Gore administration to truly defend those
they spoke loudest to when first running for office

but did Clinton/Gore ever really have it in mind to defend?
to rebuild?

we like to blame Reagan/Bush for supporting Corporate America's unbridled
expansion but it was REALLY Clinton/Gore's administration when the great
industrial exodus to Mexico took place--an economic terrorism which many
Americans have yet to recover from--an economic terrorism which has given
Mexico City the highest levels of lead in drinking water due to the lack of
EPA
standards in American factories in Mexico--and no OSHA standards and no
labor laws to speak of

a good friend of mine who worked for Planned Parenthood during the last
presidential election sent me an e-mail "YOU'LL HAVE THE BLOOD OF WOMEN ON
YOUR HANDS IF YOU VOTE FOR NADER AND GORE LOSES!"  i wrote back "YOU'LL
HAVE THE BLOOD OF WORKERS ON YOUR HANDS IF YOU VOTE FOR GORE AND
NADER LOSES!"

why is REAL CHANGE so out of reach for so many?

our grandparents had their heads busted in fighting for the 40 hour work week
fighting for child labor laws and safety regulations and paid holidays and
paid
vacations and health benefits

how quickly all that blood and sweat has evaporated with so many of the
changes they fought for with it

where is that same MAGNIFICENT American courage for change?  to insist and
defend and fight for what we know to be just and right?

by the way LET US not forget Clinton's speeches about the need to tear down
Iraq's power's that be LET US not kid ourselves that if Al (oil money himself)
Gore were in office instead that he wouldn't ALSO use the gasoline of 9-11
to fuel a strike to the heart of Iraq

the last presidential election was PROOF that many Americans DO have the
courage and the stomach for change and are willing to fight fight fight our
way through with it

my only hope is that the fear of little Bush W. doesn't force the hand in the
voting booth toward some new seemingly moderate soothing smiled cowardly
deceitful shmuck

if you too have had enough of America profiting off the back of poverty then
PLEASE have the courage to choose for a new America and a better world

i for one voted for Nader/LaDuke because it was THE FIRST TIME i voted for
a pair i truly believed in

Ron Silliman, Silliman's Blog, Friday, April 04, 2003
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/
"Bush's appointment could not have occurred without the electoral vandalism
of the Green Party."


I voted for Nader and still do not regret it. But I do resent the continued
repeating that a vote for Nader is/was a vote for Bush.

First of all it's important to remember that Bush did not win the popular
vote. He was not "elected," as Mark writes above.

Second, if any group of people had the power to seriously challenge the
criminality and hijacking of the electoral system that took place in the
weeks following the 2000 election it was the Democratic Party. They put up
a pretty tepid fight if you ask me. Why? Because they are realists. The
leaders of the Vichy regime were also realists. But are those the kind of
people you want to fight the fascists now controlling the country? Not me.
An that they would have to be contended with regardless of whether they
hold office or not should be plain.

The whole argument is like (to those of us who opposed giving Bush & co.
the "authority" to wage war in the months following 9/11/2001) blaming
people like Marjorie Perloff and Ron Silliman for the current war against
Iraq because they supported some kind of action in Afghanistan (which has
failed, if we believe the newspapers, to stop Al Queada). [ See Perloff,

<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0109&L=poetics&D=1&O=A&F=&S

=&P=49987>

It did not come as a surprise to me that Bush & co. used Afghanistan as a
springboard to attack Iraq. And Iraq is just a stepping stone to someplace
else. But people didn't want to hear that in late September 2001.
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0109&L=poetics&D=1&O=A&F=&S=

&P=90812

Besides, the mistakes of the past couple of years can be rectified, as Ron
points out, "simply by electing almost anyone else to the presidency in
2004." (Silliman's Blog, Friday, April 04, 2003)

Awesome! I hope Nader runs again. Howard Dean is someone I could certainly
vote for, but you can be sure that the Democrats would never let a man like
that take control of their party. The Democrats are "realists"---most of
the powerful ones anyway---and need people to cooperate with the fascists
when it's necessary. People like John Kerry. Vote for the war, then speak
against it on the campaign trail.

I was faculty advisor for Prosodia, the New College of California Poetics
Journal for several years.  While we had a nominal sum for production from
administration, we garnered extra funds for art work, etc. by selling ads.
Grad students were reluctant to do this, but some went right out and
canvassed local businesses around the college, which is located in the
Mission District in SF, as well as other journals.  This served excellent
purposes--familiarizing the neighborhood with our existence, advertising
local cafes and shops, and giving students the opportunity to speak
informally about what they were doing with their work.
       Donations from alumni also work to some extent.  Asking for money for
a good cause isn't a bad thing.  There are some parents who don't mind
writing a few checks.
       Good relations with deans, etc., of course, work best.  There is
always hidden money at any institution, and if administration can be
convinced that a journal advertises the college and benefits everyone,
sometimes they'll come up with the $$$.
       The biggest problem, as I see it, is follow up, distribution of the
finished product, library sales, which can generate money for the next issue.
 Students hate doing this, but if you insist that the journal is in print and
ready a couple of months before the spring semester ends, you can sometimes
get work study students to do send out follow up flyers and fill orders.
Accounting is important--to be able to show administration just how money is
spent and generated. so that you can ask again for the next issue.
       Benefit readings by big name stars also work to some extent.  Having
students volunteer labor--do assembling, help with the production
process--cuts down on costs.  You have to find a friendly printer who thinks
of the project as educational.  We were lucky.  The old West Coast Print
Center, originally funded by the NEA, then bought out by two of its workers,
donated a great deal of time over the years (before it shut down altogether)
to help grad students learn how to produce a quality journal.

Best, Gloria Frym

The Poetry Center
presents

George Stanley

Saturday April 26, 7:30 pm
at DIESEL, a bookstore
5433 College Avenue
Oakland, CA 94618
Tel: 510.653.9965, 03#
(2 blocks south from Rockridge BART)

DON'T MISS the extraordinary poet George Stanley making a rare visit
from his home in Vancouver, British Columbia, to celebrate the new
publication of A Tall, Serious Girl: Selected Poems 1957-2000 (Qua
Books, 2003), edited by Kevin Davies and Larry Fagin.  From the
editors' preface--

"This book has emerged partly from a certain frustration experienced
by its editors.  The Canada-U.S. border, though long and notoriously
undefended, is real.  When George Stanley (then age thirty-seven, but
so youthful looking that he was often mistaken for a draft dodger)
crossed it in 1971, he all but disappeared from American literary
surveillance. . . .  in our discussions with American poets young and
old, we often found mention of Stanley's work met with near-total
ignorance. . . .  Whatever the causes of his obscurity in these
States, this selection is offered as a first attempt to situate
Stanley's work in relation to that of his teachers (Spicer, Robert
Duncan, Louis Zukofsky, Charles Olson), his contemporaries, and the
formations, arguments, and poetry that have followed them."

George Stanley was born in 1934 and raised in an Irish-American
family in San Francisco.  He was educated by the Jesuits (at USF), in
Bohemian (i.e., non-Mormon) Salt Lake City, and by Jack Spicer and
Robert Duncan in North Beach.  For the past thirty years, he has
lived (and taught English) in British Columbia, Canada.


        Veracruz

        In Veracruz, city of breezes & sailors & loud birds,
        an old man, I walked the Malec=F3n by the sea,

        and I thought of my father, who when a young man
        had walked the Malec=F3n in Havana, dreaming of Brazil,

        and I wished he had gone to Brazil
        & learned magic,

        and I wished my father had come back to San Francisco
        armed with Brazilian magic, & that he had married
        not my mother, but her brother, whom he truly loved.

        I wish my father had, like Tiresias, changed himself into a woman,
        & that he had been impregnated by my uncle, & given birth to
me as a girl.

        I wish that I had grown up in San Francisco as a girl,
        a tall, serious girl,

        & that eventually I had come to Veracruz,
        & walking on the Malec=F3n, I had met a sailor,
        a Mexican sailor or a sailor from some other country --
           maybe a Brazilian sailor,
        & that he had married me, & I had become pregnant
           by him,
        so that I could give birth at last to my son -- the boy
           I love

        --George Stanley


"Those of you who know Stanley's work will be delighted, and those of
you new to his particular genius will be, ah, how do you say it,
knocked on your ass.  . .  .  Knock those other books off your shelf
- replace them with this tall, serious girl."   --Kevin Killian

"From the first, George Stanley was one of those great natural
talents of whom all other poets are jealous. . . . This must be what
it was like to have been a peer of Giotto, the first to draw perfect
circles freehand. . . .  This volume is a great gift and an even
greater test."   --Ron Silliman

"Such a rare delight to be immersed in the world of George Stanley's
selected poems. . . .  Prophetic, mythological, deeply humorous, he
deftly rearranges the myriad substances of 'identity' and 'feeling'
in the agreement we call the world.  Four decades of a timeless state
=2E . . what a pleasure to be a tall, serious, timeless reader."
--Joanne Kyger


        For Prince George

        I'll listen to the news the day I die,
        to hear who was elected, & if
        the New Jersey Devils won the sixth game
        of the Stanley Cup --
        not because I care about these things
        (truly I care less & less),
        but the game is worth the candle,
        lit by the candle.

        At Christmas, when lovers' eyes meet over the candles,
        their thought is not "you," it's pure meaning,
        infinite horizon.  I'd rather be a spectator.
        I'd rather be a spectator than play games.
        I'd like my mind to be dumb as a lover's.

        Late at night the middle-aged play Monopoly.
        One spills a drink.  Slurred voices,
        a peal of laughter.  Like the old
        balls & wreathes on the tree, that dully gleam
        from the darkened living room, their thoughts
        come out again, sure of welcome.

        --George Stanley

  MIGUEL ANGEL RIOS
NI ME BUSQUES... NO ME ENCUENTRAS
A three channel DVD projection and related works on paper

Curated by Raul Zamudio

APRIL 8  - APRIL 29, 2003
Opening Reception Thursday, April 10, 6 - 8 pm

An exhibition of recent work by Miguel Angel Rios consisting of a
three-channel DVD projection and related works on paper. The locale of
Ni me busques... No me encuentras  situates it within the rich history
of landscape representation, the Dutch Baroque panorama, Nature and the
Kantian sublime.

The use of landscape in this exhibition is rife with cultural, social
and political meaning. The artist as dominant surveyor over a
subordinated landscape presents us with a psycho-geographical sojourn
that unfolds within an organic mise-en-scene of animated flora and fauna.

Whereas the DVD projection is devoid of post-production manipulation and
is formally driven by wide-pan shots, multi-channel projection and other
cinematic techniques that allude to the landscape as "non-objective,"
the works on paper subvert landscape representation altogether through
their emphasis on simulation and artificiality.

After the 2000 election, the Miami Herald did a study that projected several
other outcomes, depending on how the various ballot perforations in Florida
were interpreted. If I remember correctly, Gore won in the majority of these
scenarios. As such, Nader's role in the election was academic, other than
giving some people (like Mr. Conrad and me) the chance  to pull the voting
lever without holding a vomit bag in their other hand. It seems to me that
Florida's electoral commission (notice what became of Ms. Harris) and the
heavily Republican U. S. Supreme Court had more of an influence on who won
the 2000 election than Nader. As a retired government employee, I can assure
you that money, sex, friendships and power-dealing have a lot more to do
with government decision-making than any publicly stated policy.

FAT CHANCE by Dodie Bellamy.  ISBN 0-9731521-3-3. $12.00 plus $2.50 for
postage and parceling.

"In this writing it's like Dodie Bellamy's being questioned by 12
detectives. They are talking over one another so naturally her voice assumes
12 simultaneous registers, each very endearing but still hot. After she
recites her collected works the detectives are willing to forgive
everything. They only want to sleep with her." Cedar Sigo

"Bellamy's Fat Chance is pellucid, masterful prose, at once a bodiceful of
grainy secrets, a set of falsities, and a treasury of urbane/innocent
candor. To her, against eternity, I raise a glass of stingo! There are many
reasons I read Bellamy, not least for the rapidity of insight, mediumistic
sprit, and her enormous, at times jocular, tenderness." Lissa Wolsak

SEVEN GLASS BOWLS by Daphne Marlatt. $10.00 plus $2.50 for postage and
parceling.
ISBN 0-9731521-5-X.

"'Home and the closeness of the beloved,' she writes. There can be no
subject as important to the poet and the rest of us, and in this lovely
poem, Daphne Marlatt continuously achieves her best yet 'homing in.' That
present participle is our sweet clue to a mystery we are encouraged to
enter. Gladly."  George Bowering

ALSO AVAILABLE FROM NOMADOS

A THOUSAND MORNINGS.  Prose poems about daily life in Vancouver's oldest
neighbourhood by Meredith Quartermain. ISBN 0-9731521-2-5.
$14.00 plus $2.50 for postage and parceling.

"Morning.  Peck at silence, dark, rage, death's mosaic.  Demand liver.
Vomit back minarets on the streets of sense.  Believe we can hide for a
time.  Believe these engines fly.  Blackened mirror of sky.  Tar it.  Stick
to it.  Open.  To gulls.  Flayed open.  Wrench the wrists, ankles, body in
the suck of tar.  Black tongues of mirror.  Listen.  Small steeples line our
streets.  Small sacred hearts."  Meredith Quartermain, A Thousand Mornings

The Gripe Against Nader:

From: London Review of Books | Vol. 23 No. 11 dated 7 June 2001 | David
Blackbourn =20

What happened last November in Florida diverted attention from Ralph Nader'=
s
part in the outcome of the Presidential election. In Florida itself, where
every vote mattered (I won't say counted), he garnered 100,000 of them. And
in New Hampshire, the only state in the North-East that Gore failed to carr=
y
- a state whose three electoral votes would have made him President even
without Florida - Nader's vote comfortably exceeded Bush's margin of
victory. Green Party supporters told pollsters that, in the absence of
Nader, they would have voted overwhelmingly for Gore (or not at all). It wa=
s
thus voting decisions by the most environmentally conscious part of the
electorate that put one former oilman in the White House, made another Vice=
-
President, and led to a Cabinet that generously represents the interests of
mining, logging, chemicals and agribusiness.

The Argument Exploding The Gripe:

From:
Tuesday November 12, 2002
The Guardian=20
George Mombiot

The Green party, led by Ralph Nader, is widely reviled by liberals in the U=
S
for "handing the presidency to Bush". The 2.7% it won in the presidential
election is said to have deprived the Democrats of power. Nader, as a
result, is now held responsible for everything from the bombing of
Afghanistan to the logging of old-growth forest. But his critics are wrong,
on two counts.

The first is that Bush did not win the presidential election. Al Gore did,
though as we know he lost the subsequent power struggle. The second is that
the Democrats won only because Nader forced them to win. In the last few
weeks before the presidential election, Gore, alarmed by Nader's popularity=
,
turned sharply to the left, promoting a series of green and progressive
policies which had previously been ignored. The result was that the
Democrats rose significantly in the opinion polls. Had Nader not frightened
them, Gore may well have lost. Had Nader frightened them a little more, Gor=
e
may have won with sufficient conviction to prevent Bush's bureaucratic coup=
.
Nader dragged the Democrats back to the electorate.

In last week's elections, by contrast, the Greens were not perceived to be =
a
major threat, partly because they have become the scapegoats for the
presidential election. The Democrats, unmolested by the prospect of
political choice, remained free to engage in their deadly dance with the
Republicans around the corporate dollar. The result - as they now
acknowledge - is that they lost touch with their core vote.

If you doubt that third parties force their bigger rivals to give the voter=
s
what they want, take a look at the Barnett formula. This is the arrangement=
,
devised by the Labour government in 1978, for distributing money to the
different parts of Britain. As even Joel Barnett, who invented it, now
concedes, the formula is "grossly unfair".

Scotland and Wales are given far more public money than the poorest English
regions. The people of the north-east, for example, are on average 13%
poorer than the people of Scotland, but they each receive 20% less
government spending. The reason is straightforward: in Scotland and Wales,
Labour's vote is threatened by the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru,
while the voters of north-east England love their party not wisely but too
well. Their failure to extend their own political options permits the
government to walk all over them.

A vote for a third political party, even one which has no chance of being
elected, could, far from being wasted, be the most powerful vote you can
cast. It is arguably the only force which could drag the bigger parties
apart, oblige "progressive" politicians to implement progressive policies
and enhance the scope of mainstream democratic choice. Ralph Nader, as the
mid-term elections show, did not sink the Democrats; he rescued them. The
tragedy of American politics is that they were too blinkered to see it.

Monthly Review
Feb. 2001
The Nader Campaign and the Future
of U.S. Left Electoral Politics
by The Editors
   =20
The unlikely postelection contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush, which
ultimately led to the anointing of Bush as president by the Republican
majority on the US Supreme Court (despite the fact that Bush received fewer
popular votes than Gore both in the United States as a whole and most likel=
y
in Florida as well=8Bthe state that gave Bush his electoral college win), has
tended to erase all other developments associated with the election. But al=
l
of this should not cause us to forget that the Ralph Nader Green Party
campaign for the presidency was arguably the most extraordinary phenomenon
in US left politics in many years. On election day he drew nearly three
million votes, representing about 3 percent of the vote. Even former
Vice-President Henry Wallace did not fare so well in his third-party run fo=
r
the presidency in 1948, the last progressive third-party presidential
campaign of this nature and magnitude. Although exit polls show that Nader
received few racial minority votes (a major weakness of his campaign), he
nonetheless drew his strongest support from those without a college
education, those with incomes less than thirty thousand dollars a year, and
those without full-time employment. Until the intense scare campaign
instigated by the Democrats in the final two weeks before the election,
Nader was getting as much as 7 percent in some tracking polls.

Nader ran quite far to the left on issue after issue; this was no
warmed-over version of mainstream liberal Democratic politics. The Green
platform was an antineoliberal progressive platform that any socialist coul=
d
support openly. At the same time, Nader enjoyed tremendous and enthusiastic
crowds on the campaign trail, often appearing before paying crowds that
ranged from ten to fifteen thousand with hardly any advance work. Were ther=
e
no public opinion polls, one who merely watched the size and nature of crow=
d
responses to the candidates on the campaign trail might have thought Nader
the likely winner or at least a strong contender for victory. Moreover,
these crowds were dominated by young people. Such a response would have bee=
n
unthinkable one or two decades ago.

Nader was the best-suited and arguably the only feasible candidate to make =
a
progressive third-party run in 2000. He came of age in the 1960s when
progressive political figures had some opportunity to gain exposure in the
media culture; he has long been a household name. (As Nader notes, with the
rightward shift of our political landscape and the hypercommercialism of ou=
r
media culture, serious progressive critics of the status quo have had far
less opportunity to gain national exposure in the past two decades, unless
they are political humorists like Michael Moore or people who become
celebrities for other reasons and then discuss politics, like Susan
Sarandon.) He is also highly regarded for a list of accomplishments in the
public interest that is nothing short of stunning. Nader turned to electora=
l
politics only when it became clear that the degree of corporate domination
over both parties made the sort of public interest work he did nearly
impossible to pursue with any hope of success. Nader is not a socialist, bu=
t
he is a principled democrat who has the courage to call for sweeping reform=
s
in the political economy when it is apparent that corporate domination and
class inequality are undermining democracy. Nader spoke brilliantly in plai=
n
language to everyday Americans from a range of backgrounds about the need
for sweeping structural reform, a lost art among many on the left.

The issue that was the foundation of the Nader campaign was his opposition
to the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), and the entirety of the global procapitalist trade, investment, an=
d
regulatory system. Unlike nationalist opponents of the WTO like Pat
Buchanan, Nader=B9s opposition was on democratic grounds: these agencies were
not subject to popular control in the United States or elsewhere and were
therefore illegitimate. Moreover, Nader was and is arguably the world=B9s
foremost expert on exactly how these institutions of global capitalism are
generating disastrous results across the planet for workers, consumers, and
the environment. Nader and the Greens also favored deep cuts in the US
military budget and apparatus and opposed US material support for
reactionary regimes and policies around the world. Nader, who drew 19
percent of the total Muslim vote (72 percent of which went to Bush),
declared that there will be no peace in the Middle East =B3without justice fo=
r
the Palestinians.=B2 In sum, Nader and the Greens offered a progressive and
nonimperialist foreign policy that was decidedly outside the =B3bipartisan
consensus=B2 that is almost never debated in the US electoral arena.

This is a point that merits consideration because the discussion of the
Nader campaign, even on the left, has focused almost entirely on his
critique of the domestic imbalance of power, giving very slight attention
the international aspects. The United States is the dominant imperial power
in the world and this is the central unspoken truth of our times. In the
global capitalist order, the US state has a number of responsibilities: to
keep the system functioning; to control the underlying populations; to
safeguard the United States as the center of the international financial
system; to maintain the United States (and, specifically, US
capitalists/corporations) in the top perch in the imperialist pecking order=
;
and to prevent countries from breaking away from the system of global
controls. For these reasons, in addition to domestic pressure from the
military-industrial complex, the United States maintains, by a very wide
margin, the world=B9s largest military, though it has no rival whatsoever in
any traditional sense. Although the wider foreign policy implications of
Nader=B9s campaign were almost never reported in the media, they clearly
represented a threat to the global status quo.

Indeed, Nader the candidate never got the opportunity to communicate these
or any other positions to the great mass of Americans because his campaign
was absolutely butchered in the news media. Nader=B9s coverage in the New Yor=
k
Times resembled, in some respects, the coverage Andrei Sakharov got from
Pravda and Izvestia back in the 1970s. This should be no surprise but it wa=
s
sobering nonetheless. Without gobs of money to purchase TV advertising=8Bthe
lingua franca of US politics=8Bor, better yet, without the sort of massive
grassroots operation that could overcome the media blackout, many citizens
never had any idea that Nader was running vigorously or what his positions
were on the issues he was addressing. (If the winner of the election were
determined by who spent the least for each of their votes or who received
the least amount of news coverage per vote, Nader would have won in a
landslide.) Most of the media attention Nader did receive was obsessed with
how his candidacy would affect the fortunes of Democrat Al Gore. This was
true even on the left and among progressives. Numerous leftists who
supported Nader on the issues opposed his candidacy, often with startling
bitterness, because it would take votes away from Gore, the =B3lesser of two
evils=B2=8Bwhich became a mantra to a greater extent than any time since 1968.
The 2000 race highlighted again how the US electoral laws have a deeply
conservative and undemocratic bias that increases dramatically the degree o=
f
difficulty for both third parties and progressives.

In our view, the Nader campaign was the electoral side of the mass
organizing that produced the extraordinary demonstrations in Seattle in 199=
9
and in Washington, DC, and at the two national political conventions in
2000. As with those demonstrations, there is no guarantee that this upsurge
in activism will produce a sustained movement capable of fundamentally
changing the existing order. But we believe the evidence suggests that ther=
e
are new openings for popular left organizing in the United States, and that
the chance to organize for progressive electoral candidates is better than
at any time in memory. It is possible that a left electoral movement can,
within a generation, become a dominant political force in the nation. It ma=
y
not be an explicitly socialist movement that will invoke the icons of the
left that MR readers cut their teeth on but it will be a progressive
anticorporate movement by any measure. There is an important and necessary
role for the socialist left in this movement. The implications of these
developments go well beyond the United States, in view of the US role as th=
e
dominant global capitalist power. If a viable prodemocracy, anti-imperialis=
t
movement can emerge here, it will improve the possibilities dramatically fo=
r
socialists and progressives worldwide.

Just to follow up on the url Stephen Vincent sent for Robert Fisk's =
article in today's Independent.

Fisk cites the Lebanese poet Khilal Gibran:

The great Lebanese poet Kalil Gibran once wrote that he pitied the =
nation that welcomed its tyrants with trumpetings and dismissed them =
with hootings of derision. And the people of Baghdad performed this same =
deadly ritual yesterday, forgetting that they - or their parents - had =
behaved in identical fashion when the Arab Socialist Baath Party =
destroyed the previous dictatorship of Iraq's generals and princes. =
Forgetting, too, that the "liberators" were a new and alien and =
all-powerful occupying force with neither culture nor language nor race =
nor religion to unite them with Iraq.
http://argument.independent.co.uk/commentators/story.jsp?story=3D395707

The lines Fisk is referring to are from a poem called "In the Garden of =
the Prophet" the full text of which is at http://leb.net/gibran/

"Pity the nation that acclaims the bully as hero, and that deems the =
glittering conqueror bountiful.
"Pity the nation that despises a passion in its dream, yet submits in =
its awakening.=20
"Pity the nation that raisesnot its voice save when it walks in a =
funeral, boasts not except when its neck is laid between the sword and =
the block.=20
"Pity the nation whose statesman is a fox, whose philosopher is a =
juggle, and whose art is the art of patching and mimicking.=20
"Pity the nation that welcomes its new ruler with trumpetings, and =
farewells him with hootings, only to welcome another with trumpetings =
again.=20
"Pity the nation whose sages are dumb with years and whose strong men =
are yet in the cradle.=20
"Pity the nation divided into fragments, each fragment deeming itself a =
nation."=20

Hi all,

Some of you may have noticed Matt Hart's review of my new book _MS_ in the
recent Poetry Project Newsletter.  A couple of people have asked me where they
can purchase it.  It will be available very soon on amazon.com,
barnesandnoble.com and order-able through your local bookstore.  The details
are:

Michael Magee, MS (Spuyten Duyvil, 2003), 90 pp., ISBN 1-881471-20-9.

In the meantime, if you're peeing your pants in anticipation and want to order
a copy now, you can order it directly from National Book Network at

1-800-462-6420

I've copied below the kind comments which appear on the back cover, from some
poets I greatly admire.  Here's hoping you buy the book and enjoy it!  A more
formal announcement will come from Spuyten Duyvil once the book's widely
available.  -m.

***************************
Stuttering turns into syncopation in this edgily engaging collocation of
accents, attitudes, occasions. The poems in MS are provocative, certainly
without idealization, the dollars-and-cents context of our grainy American
dream. Mike Magee's  detailed optical-ocular orbiting  effects –– "other-wise /
waning or adroitly loitering" –– make reading this collection a constant
surprise.

––Susan Howe

Does the poet diagnose a medical condition or continue a feminist tradition? Is
it a motor ship or a manuscript? A degree of science or a software appliance?
Recklessly eyeballing Mike Magee's "grainy American dream," my optic nerves
jangle to the tune of jump-cut language, slurred and blurred words flashed on
the screen of memory with a quick trigger finger on the universal remote.
Magee's MS interrupts our programming with his alternative vision.

––Harryette Mullen

The discursively promiscuous clauses of these poems—cut generously with a
slide-wit on the national symbols blared, dice up much of the lingering prosaic
transparency of American Poetry (Inc.).  Here’s no monologic gnosis gnashing of
"repressed subject" possibilities, while at the same time no fashionable
duncing of the socially determinative either. This rhetor’s got the apps (and
multiplexed ‘mouth’) to get you to the next level—Your Turn.

--Rodrigo Toscano

Michael Magee's MS is new music...a carnivalesque palimpsest of vision and
ventriloquy, supple rhythm informed by Hiphop era ironies and an erudite grasp
of postmodern poetics. This marvelous Century 21 ethnic American remix of
personal history and society's mystery is both demanding and delightful.  You
need this book!  Mr. Magee creates poems that tickle the ear and open a new
window in the mind's eye.  Read aloud.  Think fast.

––Lorenzo Thomas

  I can't help but notice that there's been a virulent outbreak of truly awful Arabic Po of late on this site. Bad poetry has its place in the Arab world as it does in America, see the Pulitzer Prizes. But as part of Operation Iraqui Freedom, maybe we can follow the marines & po it mo' better...drn...

Is there a way this bully can be asked to leave the listserv?  I usually
avoid his posts, but have unfortunately read two of them today.

Flash 6

speakers on

A month or so ago Alan mentioned to me that he had once written a text editor that was designed to "frustrate" the writing of the user. This editor would transform the user's writing as the user enetered text. I thought it was an ingenious concept for a piece: a work that combined the networking possibilities of user input and transformation...a work that would literally change what the user invested in the object...So I set about making an approximation of what Alan was talking about.

This is the web mix of that idea. A full blown piece of software based on this concept is still in the works (I'm writing THAT one in C++), but this Flash version combines that concept with some multimedia ideas. To use it, simply enter text in the blue box. Every time you press enter, your text will change; sometimes it will be replaced by a line from some of Alan's writing, sometimes it will spatter your text in asemic strings across the box, sometimes your text will simply disappear, and sometimes a combination of these will happen. I doubt that this work is anywhere near as capable as Alan's original program, but it seems to me to be a worthy web amusement.

There are four different background music sequences, and these load when this page loads. Revisit to hear them all.

The film loop is Alan's: I altered it, but it can be found in its original form on Alan's Internet Text site (http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/).

and James Fenton, "Lines for Translation into Any Language":

1. I saw that the shanty town had grown over the graves and that the crowd
lived among the memorials.

2 It was never very cold--a parachute slung between an angel and an urn
afforded shelter for the newcomers.

3. Wooden beds were essential.

4. These people kept their supplies of gasoline in litre bottles, which
their children sold at the cemetary gates.

5. That night the city was attacked with rockets.

6. The firebrigade bided its time.

7. The people dug for money beneath their beds, to pay the firemen.

8. The shanty town was destroyed, the cemetary restored.

9. Seeing a plane shot down, not far from the airport, many of the foreign
community took fright.

10. The next day, they joined the queues at the gymnasium, asking to leave.

11. When the victorious army arrived, they were welcomed by the firebrigade.


12. This was the only spontaneous demonstration in their favor.

13. Other spontaneous demonstations in their favor were organised by the
victors.

is there a way to ask someone to leave the listserv? yes of course there is-
ask them to leave.

but why exactly do you want him to leave? because he inferred that gibran is
a bad poet?

so since when does expressing your opinion make you a bully?

this is pretty damn wimpy...and is yet another demonstration of why this
list is about as useful as a supermarket circular.

yes, nudel's posts have had somewhat of an "edge" to them...but that is only
relative. his scribblings have hardly been the stuff of henry miller, yet it
speaks to the tepid and generally mind-numbing quality of the average post
on this list that his posts stand out in this way at all.

to me, bitching about someone being a "bully" on a poetry list is a little
like asking someone to put out their cigarette in a bar. it's just wimpy.

and don't even get me started about the spell-checking comment.
squaresville, man. squaresville.

It's true that the contemp ear rebels at 19th Century translation phonix -
so that Gibran tho seductive in message also sounds sonorously false,
sentimental, and without a propellant edge. Since time be precious this
morning (and tomorrow and tomorrow for most as well!), I took one line of
the Gibran to retranslate the English into something stronger - tho the
shared line may also be "upped.". Maybe others here can each grab a line or
more and hit the trigger. I think its a poem worth a rebirth:

Subject:      Byrne review
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The following review appears in the latest edition of the Burning Bush, ed.
Michael Begnal, 3 Newcastle Road, Galway, Ireland.

Mairéad Byrne, Nelson & the Huruburu Bird (Wild Honey Press), reviewed by
Michael S. Begnal

A back cover blurb by one Alan Dugan succinctly describes this collection
"Mairéad Byrne is an Irish poet in America. She's not an immigrant. She's
just here. She writes with love and fury about what's right and wrong about
Ireland, plus some swipes and kisses at America..." Nelson & the Hun~buru
Birds is a compendium of three unpublished full collections, distilled into
one book, which leads me to wonder: If she was going to have a book
published, why not publish one of these collections first, then (hopefully)
release the others succeedingly in due course? Are these simply the best
poems from each of the three, or were they chosen because they were felt to
interact with each other in some particular way? Minor points, to be sure,
but it did make me curious about where Byrne sees this volume in the scheme
of her overall work.
 But whatever about that Nelson & the Huruburu Birds is a pretty damn good
book in itself. It is more immediately accessible than many readers of the
Wild Honey imprint will be used to. In a way I missed having to struggle
with the intricate texts of Healy or Scully, but at the same time it was
nice to be able to relax a bit and simply soak up the lush imagery and the
idiosyncratically observed details of life and memory. "Lying Awake with the
Windows Open" is a perfect example of what Byrne is capable of: "I heard
shiny green / leaves load with raindrops and spill. / I beard the town
grumble deep in its throat. / I heard darkness congregating in clumps / like
infantry at ease, the nervous gear- / shifts of drivers circling for
cigarettes." Elsewhere, in "The Pools," the darkness is described thusly "I
am talking about dusk, / how it bit like ink into blotting
paper; / night was a big soaked wad. / It was spongy as that. / I could chew
it." Yeah!
 A lot of Irish people, understandably, know America only through the medium
of television or film, even though Saint Brendan is rumoured to have
discovered the place. Byrne's "The Irish Discover America" captures that
moment of arriving, the juxtaposition of reality and media image: 'We hit
land and suddenly / everyone has an American accent. / How did I get here? /
I traveled the few inches, thousands of miles, / in my own skin boat, my
currach, my Boeing. / For the first time I look at the outside world." A
very Irish feeling, I think, finds expression in "Commercial Street": "This
is not home and I don't have to stop / to pass the time of day or night with
you / or anyone. I'm free of that, home too..."
Ireland does figure prominently here, however, in childhood reminiscences
like "Cycling to Marino," or in the "found poem" "Briathra Comónta sa
Teanga/ Common Verbs in the Language" (says the note: "I found this partial
list of Irish language verbs on a table in the staff smoking room in Newpark
Comprehensive School, Dublin..."). (Byrne is quite fond of found poems,
including several others such as a page from a Christie's catalogue, and
screen directions from John Huston's film script for The Dead.) But her most
sustained and penetrating view of Ireland is in "The Pillar," a long major
poem that was previously published by Wild Honey as its own pamphlet. Sizing
up Ireland's post-colonial complexes back through young eyes of 1966, the
year Nelson's Pillar was blown up by the IRA, Byrne gives us a revealing
portrait of a country bogged down in its own history-. "The Pillar had shot
its wad / and we stood in its spume / knee-deep in rubble / not knowing to
take credit or what."
The latter section of Nelson & the Huruburu Birds is wet with streams of
consciousness, and I was occasionally reminded of the early Ferlinghetti.
This is a great book from a poet whose primary talent is description, and
the ability to paint, in 'words, the everyday revelations that lay people
are often immune to.

Marc Ngui is cartoonist/amateur diagrammatician currently hacking it out
in the professionaljungles of Toronto. He's been making zines since his
teens,these being mostly self-published under the Bumblenut Pictures
imprint. Marc willattempt to bring to life the endearingly demented
little world of his graphic novel Enter avariz using various biological
and electro-mechanical devices. (http://www.bumblenut.com)

Charlie Anders makes way more sense if you listen to the director's
commentary instead of the main audio track. Her writing has appeared in
Salon.com, the SF Bay Guardian, Anything That Moves and dozens of other
magazines, anthologies and ransom notes. She's the author of the Lazy
Crossdresser,a style manual and manifesto for slack trannies,and
co-publisher of other magazine,the magazine for people who defy
categories.Charlie will be ranting,reading short stories,gender-busting
and possibly singing. (http://www.charlie-girl.com)

Corey Frost is the author of My Own Devices,a book of stories about
traveling as yourself, as well as several chapbooks, such as Tonight
You'll Have a Filthy Dream and I Feel Perfectly Fine. If people often
refer to him as a poet, it is because of his widely-appreciated spoken
word performances using music and images. He will be performing
selections from his CD,Bits World: Exciting Version, including a story
about the ethical dimension of eating a Plum.
(http://www.attcanada.ca/~coreyf)

The Perpetual Motion Roadshow runs entirely on volunteer power. Those
who like their culture free of that oily corporate taste are invited to
get involved. To keep it going, we need a supply of AGENTS in each of
the cities, VENUES to rock, and CREWMEMBERS to go on tour IN future
Roadshows. Sign up and find out more at www.NoMediaKings.net

Irregular Verbs Used Against Iraqi Positions

Torrents of verbs flow into and out of Kuwait City, out of Doha
in Qatar, out of the Pentagon, out of Whitehall. Regular air and

ground verbs, such as target, bomb, destroy, fly over the arid stretches
of Iraqi desert to find their marks in Basra, in Mosul, in Baghdad.

The irregular verbs are shot through with patterns: blow-blew, throw-threw.
Not that we'd expect any less from a laundry list of arbitrary items.

However, the terrorizing, indiscriminate, experimental, and often long-
lasting nature of these verbs make for horrible and illegal battle tactics,

while not causing as many civilian casualties as do regular verbs, with or
without their participles dangling or infinitives spit out there in broad desert

daylight, for all to see, by rockets' loud blare, without night-
vision goggles, even.

Peter Davison's review of Muldoon is perhaps worth looking at too, albeit
for a different reason.  Beneath Davison's cloying praise for Muldoon as a
clever, "fun" writer there is the suggestion that his poems are basically
nonsense verses without any real emotion or force.  This judgment is one
that I think many people make about Muldoon, and it seems related to
judgments (or  resentments) that have been directed at quite different
poets such as Merrill, Ashbery, Heather McHugh, among others.  Basically,
the judgment is that these are technically brilliant writers who have
wasted their gifts in stupid, narcissistic play.

One contemporary poetic ideal -- with champions in every camp -- seems to
be a verbal dexterity so adroit and dazzling that it can dance over all the
embarrassing and banal reasons why people actually read literature in the
first place.  Academics have worked out a professional discourse that
avoids all these topics (while pretending to explain everything).  It would
be encouraging if poets weren't so eager to follow suit.

I'm reminded again that one of the great things about Creeley is that he is
willing to take the risk of writing about dangerously commonplace or banal
subject matter, emotions, situations, etc.

Adams: "most if not all of these genuinely creative spirits have been
passed over year after year, often in favor of --> ACADEMY <-- composers
who have won a disproportionate number of prizes."

MIME-Version: 1.0

To: LaborAgainstWar <laboragainstwar@yahoogroups.com>

I sent this message to the list of all City Council members with email,
printed below (Feel free to use the list!!!):

Dear City Council Representative,

This morning I was a "media person" for the protest against the Carlyle
Group -- the multi-billion dollar corporation headed by former Secretary of
Defense Frank Carlucci, and board members George H.W. Bush, James Baker and
other power-packed war profiteers.

I was appalled at the aggressive tactics of the NYPD, and I am writing to
request three things:

1) That you immediately call 1 Police Plaza and let them know that you want
all the arrestees released immediately;

2) That you again hold hearings on the ongoing pattern of police harassment
of antiwar activists  in this case, many who were intentionally standing
across the street and away from the site of the planned civil disobedience
to avoid confusion and arrest.

3) That police commissioner Ray Kelly be subpoenaed to testify at the
hearings.

Below is an accurate story posted to IndyMedia. Please note that some of
those who were manhandled and arrested for WATCHING the protest from across
the street are in their late 70s and already have severe health issues;
others who were on their way to work; and still others who were doing media
interviews at the time they were arrested!

On behalf of the NY State Greens/Green Party of NY, and on behalf of our
members (and everyone else) who was victimized by the police this morning,
I urge you to take action to preserve civil liberties in our City, and make
absolutely clear that abuse by police will not be tolerated.

Thank you,
Mitchel Cohen

Jonathon:

thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

I'm not going to reproduce the whole thing here,
but if you're reading this and you haven't seen
jonathon's post, please scroll down to find it.

the pieces included here articulate exactly not
only the ultimate good of nader's campaign, if
taken in the context of the entire progressive
movement, but also the short-sightedness, some
might even say brain-washedness, of those on the
left who continue to chastise nader for running at
all. that stumblebum al gore managed to squander a
huge lead (which, remember, was in the double
digits as late as august 2000) in the polls and
then bungle the p.r. campaign in florida should
not be laid at nader's door.

third party candidates have ALWAYS been about
raising issues that the big parties don't want to
talk about. if there is ANY HOPE at all of
breaking the corporate-military stranglehold on
power in this country and establishing a real
grass-roots power base, it lies not with the dems
but with local campaigns and third-party
candidates. far from continuing to flagellate
itself for nader's run, the left ought to be
threatening the dems with another vote-draining
campaign, if that's what it takes to get them to
come to the table and bring them back to their
traditional core constituency -- the poor, the
working class, the immigrants, etc.

Immediately after I asked if Mr. N. might be asked to leave the listserv I
realized that I was endorsing censorship, and I now retract my request on
that basis.

Later it was implied that my comments were "wimpy" and being human felt
bullied by the aggresssive/condescending tone of that email.

As a frequent listserv reader I enjoy the "supermarket circulars" and value
the many thoughtful posts I read--as well as the sense of community, one I
work to maintain and support in old Walt's Camden.

the symbol emerges as culture emerges, defines and constructs
space. propositional logic is based on shaky foundation of flux
and obscurity; in the dark, identity and equivalence are identical
and equivalent. as one escapes, the origin disappears, becomes
problematic, is deferred. as one escapes, the origin is annihilated.
culture is entropic in its very foundation, noisy in its axiomatics,
asservations. what is gained is always on the back of chaos; what is
spoken, must be whispered; it is the murmur that is whispered.
nothing and everything is built within the murmur, speaking it
louder, crushing its voice. the throat of the world is its silencing.

Police Stop Collecting Data on Protesters' Politics

By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

  hen a series of large antiwar protests began nearly eight weeks ago,=20=

the New York Police Department started questioning hundreds of people=20
arrested at the demonstrations about their prior political activity and=20=

recording the information in a database.



  But yesterday, after the practice came to light, the Police Department=20=

said it would destroy the database, created with a debriefing form, and=20=

largely abandon the initiative, which civil libertarians and=20
constitutional law experts said was deeply troubling.



  "After a review, the department has decided to eliminate the use of=20
the Demonstration Debriefing Form," Michael O'Looney, the department's=20=

chief spokesman, said in a statement. "Arrestees will no longer be=20
asked questions pertaining to prior demonstration history, or school=20
name. All information gathered since the form's inception on Feb. 15=20
has been destroyed."



  Several constitutional scholars and civil libertarians said that the=20=

practice raised grave questions about whether asking people about their=20=

political affiliations or activity would have a severe chilling effect=20=

on protest and speech that are protected by the First Amendment.



  Central to the practice was the debriefing form, which detectives used=20=

to record where the arrested protesters went to school, their=20
membership in any organizations and their involvement in past protests.



  Mr. O'Looney said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and his deputy=20=

commissioner for intelligence, David Cohen, a former top Central=20
Intelligence Agency official, did not know the debriefing form was in=20
use. Mr. Cohen oversees the Intelligence Division detectives who=20
conducted the questioning sessions at 1 Police Plaza as the protesters=20=

waited for their arrests to be processed.



  "When it was brought to their attention," Mr. O'Looney said, "they=20
took a look at it, decided some of those questions were not critical to=20=

our needs and decided to end its use."



  He would not comment on the constitutional issues raised by the=20
questions or say who had developed the form. Mr. O'Looney said that no=20=

disciplinary action was being contemplated against those responsible=20
for developing the practice.



  The police practice came to light after the New York Civil Liberties=20=

Union, which had notified protest organizers that it was seeking=20
reports of possible police abuse or interference at the city's first=20
large antiwar protest on Feb. 15, received hundreds of e-mail messages,=20=

said Christopher Dunn, the group's associate legal director. More than=20=

a dozen of the messages included accounts of arrested demonstrators'=20
being questioned about their political activity, Mr. Dunn said.



  The group later obtained a copy of the debriefing form from lawyers=20
who had sought to represent some of the demonstrators taken to 1 Police=20=

Plaza for questioning after protests on Feb. 15 and March 22, Mr. Dunn=20=

said. Those lawyers were in most cases denied access to the arrested=20
protesters, raising additional concerns about the protesters' right to=20=

counsel, Mr. Dunn said.



  The Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to Mr. Kelly on Tuesday=20
complaining that the information sought during the questioning was=20
constitutionally protected, and called on him to halt the practice. The=20=

letter cited the group's concern that the department had "embarked upon=20=

a concerted campaign to collect information about lawful First=20
Amendment activity" and was "using the coercive environment of an=20
arrest interrogation to obtain that information outside the presence of=20=

counsel."



  Yesterday, after a reporter inquired about the questioning and the=20
commissioner's response to the letter, Mr. O'Looney said Mr. Kelly had=20=

halted the practice, but would not elaborate on how it had begun.



  Mr. O'Looney said that the department would continue to ask arrested=20=

protesters what groups they were affiliated with and would retain the=20
information in the form of a tally, but not with individuals' names. He=20=

said that knowing how many people had been arrested from particular=20
groups would help the department assign the right number of officers to=20=

future protests by the same groups.



  He also said that because the department viewed the questioning of the=20=

arrested demonstrators as "debriefings" rather than "interrogations,"=20
they were not entitled to a lawyer, a position with which Mr. Dunn and=20=

other civil liberties lawyers vehemently disagreed.



  Donna Lieberman, the Civil Liberties Union's executive director, said=20=

the group was pleased that the department had reversed what she called=20=

an ill-conceived policy. "This is a practice that never should have=20
happened and raised serious First Amendment concerns," she said. "But=20
the good news is that the city had second thoughts about it in response=20=

to our objections."



  The disclosure of the practice and the department's decision to halt=20=

it came just two weeks after a federal judge relaxed guidelines that=20
for nearly 20 years had limited police surveillance and investigation=20
of political groups. The guidelines, which are known as the Handschu=20
Agreement, were put in place as a result of a class action lawsuit=20
brought in 1971 on behalf of people who felt threatened by police=20
surveillance of political activities in the late 1960's and early=20
1970's. They required the department to seek approval of a special=20
panel to investigate political groups or activities.



  The judge, Charles S. Haight of Federal District Court in Manhattan,=20=

eased the limits after the police sought greater latitude to conduct=20
terrorism investigations. The lawsuit stemmed from the activities of=20
the Intelligence Division, the same unit responsible for the=20
questioning.



  Jethro M. Eisenstein, one of the lawyers who handled the case that led=20=

to the limits and recently argued before Judge Haight against their=20
loosening, contended yesterday that the questioning =97 some of which=20
occurred before the guidelines were changed on March 25 =97 violated the=20=

earlier limits and might also have violated the new guidelines. Mr.=20
O'Looney said the department took the position that questioning=20
violated neither set of guidelines.



  Intelligence gathering in all its forms, whether surveillance of=20
mosques or keeping track of homeless people, has become more widespread=20=

in American policing since Sept. 11, 2001. But the practice has raised=20=

new questions for a society founded on the principles of individual=20
freedoms.



  While such practices seem threatening to some people, others are more=20=

willing to cede some rights in the pursuit of greater security. But one=20=

of the protesters who was arrested on Feb. 15 and questioned about his=20=

political affiliations and past protesting felt otherwise.



  "I was very concerned," said Brendan Knowlton, 26, a computer=20
programmer who was arrested as he was trying to reach the protest that=20=

day on First Avenue. "I felt that the cops were on a fishing=20
expedition," he said. "The whole thing felt sketchy. It felt=20
inappropriate and irrelevant for why we were actually there."

Amazing or not??!! I find this pretty(!) upsetting. S

Student poets victimised for anti-war stance

NEW MEXICO, USA - On March 17, the day of US President George Bush's
televised announcement of the imminent US military attack on Iraq, Green
Left Weekly writer Bill Nevins was suspended from his teaching job at
Rio
Rancho New Mexico public high school. The student Poetry Slam Team/Write
Club, which Nevins organises and sponsors, was also barred from
performing
their outspoken words in public. This took place after an anti-war poem
written by a Rio Rancho New Mexico poetry team member read out a poem
over
the in-school closed circuit TV system. Following the reading, the
student's
parent (also a teacher at the school) was ordered by an assistant
principal
to go home and search the student's room for a print copy of the poem.
The
parent declined to do so. All members of the poetry team were
individually
interrogated by the school administration. The charge against Nevins is
that
he permitted students to perform at public poetry readings without
approved
``field trip'' forms being on file. Nevins is fighting the suspension
with
the strong support of the New Mexico teachers' union. The Slam
Team/Write
Club has achieved local fame for the courageous way that multicultural
youth
from the school and the community had put their words of anger and
protest
into fine-crafted poetry. They have delivered these bursts of truth on
local
television, in print and at frequent poetry open mikes throughout
central
New Mexico. The team was planning to appear at the Taos State Wide Youth
Poetry Slam on March 21 but was told by the Rio Rancho High School
administration on March 17 that they may be barred from going there by
the
school. Several students vowed to go to Taos anyway and to speak out
there
against repression in the USA, denial of free speech at their school and
the
suspension of Nevins. GLW readers are asked to send protest letters to
New
Mexico governor Bill Richardson from his web site at
http://www.governor.state.nm.us

Below is the poem that was read out:



Revolution X

Bush said no child would be left behind

And yet kids from inner-city schools

Work on Central Avenue

Jingling cans that read

Please sir, may I have some more?

They hand out diplomas like toilet paper

And lower school standards

Because

Underpaid, unrespected teachers

Are afraid of losing their jobs

Funded by the standardised tests

That shows our competency

When I'm in detox.

This is the Land of the Free ...

Where the statute of limitations for rape is only five damn years!

And immigrants can't run for President.

Where Muslims are hunted because

Some suicidal men decided they didn't like

Our arrogant bid for modern imperialism.

This is the Land of the Free ...

You drive by a car whose

Bumper screams

God bless America!

Well, you can scratch out the B

And make it Godless

Because God left this country a long time ago.

The founding fathers made this nation

On a dream and now

Freedom of Speech

Lets Nazis burn crosses, but

Calls police to

Gay pride parades.

We somehow

Can afford war with Iraq

But we can't afford to pay the teachers

Who educate the young who hold the guns

Against the "Axis of Evil"

Land of the Free ...

This is the land

If you're politically assertive

They call you a traitor and

Damn you to ostracism.

Say good-bye to Johnny Walker Lindh

And his family.

Bye Bye.

American Pie.

So maybe

My ideas about this nation

Don't resolve around perfection

But at least I know

Education is more important

Than money.

Land of the Free . . .

If this was utopia

We'd have to see each other naked

Before we got married

But instead, we see each other naked all the time

Because the government has my social security number

And the name of my dog!

And then we make babies,

But don't worry, they won't be left behind

And they grow up saying

God bless America!

But they don't know who Bush is

Because they never learned the Presidents.

And they will ride the ship Amistad

To our dreamland shores

Bearing the same shackles as us.

I'm here to say that

Generation X

Is pissed and we are taking over,

Ripping down the American illusion of perfection

We are the future generation

I have my qualifications

I know it looks like Angel Soft paper,

But don't worry

It's a diploma

Do I look qualified?

You can take our toilet paper,

But you can't take our Revolution.

I don't think anyone else got it either--there's nothing to get.
Maybe he's trying to move a copy of The Dark End of the Street. Hope

  WAGING WAR OR PEACE?
>
Dr. Robert Muller, former assistant secretary general of the United
Nations, now Chancellor emeritus of the University of Peace in Costa
Rica was one of the people who witnessed the founding of the U.N. and
has worked in support of or inside the U.N. ever since.
>
Recently he was in San Francisco to be honored for his service to the
world through the U.N. and through his writings and teachings for
peace. At age eighty, Dr. Muller surprised, even stunned, many in the
audience that day with his most positive assessment of where the
world stands now regarding war and peace.

"I'm so honored to be here. I'm so honored to be alive at such a miraculous
time in history. I'm so moved by what's going on in our world today.
Never before in the history of the world has there been a global,
visible, public, viable, open dialogue and conversation about the
very legitimacy of war. The whole world is in now having this
critical and historic Dialogue -- listening to all kinds of points of
view and positions about going to war or not going to war. In a huge
global public conversation the world is asking -
>
>  'Is war legitimate?
>  Is it illegitimate?
>  Is there enough evidence to warrant an attack?
>  Is there not enough evidence to warrant an attack?
>  What will be the consequences?
>  The costs?
>  What will happen after a war?
>  How will this set off other conflicts?
>  What might be peaceful alternatives?
>  What kind of negotiations are we not thinking of?
>  What are the real intentions for declaring war?'
>
"We are not at war. We, the world community, are WAGING peace. We're in
peacetime. Yes, troops are being moved. Yes, warheads are being lined
up. Yes, the aggressor is angry and upset and spending a billion
dollars a day preparing to attack. In the process, he pointed out,
new alliances are being formed. Russia and China on the same side of
an issue is an unprecedented outcome. France and Germany working
together to wake up the world to a new way of seeing the situation.
The largest peace demonstrations in the history of the world are
taking place! Most peace demonstrations in recent history took place
when a war was already waging, sometimes for years, as in the case of
Vietnam.
>
"So this is a miracle. This is what 'waging peace' looks like."

Through these global peace-waging efforts, the leaders of that nation
are being engaged in further public dialogue, forcing them to
rethink, and allowing all nations to participate in the serious and
horrific decision to go to war or not.
>
Dr. Muller also made reference to a recent New York Times article
that pointed out that up until now there has been just one super -
power - the United States, and that that has created a kind of
blindness in the vision of the U.S. But now, Dr. Muller asserts,
there are two superpowers: the United States and the merging, surging
voice of the people of the world.

I couldn't agree more with Jordan.  Ashbery and the rest of the NY School
gang were monster innovators.  While the flattery of imitation can dilute the

concrete poetry (KON-kreet PO-i-tree, kon-KREET -) noun

   Poetry that employs physical arrangement of words or letters on a page
   for visual effect to add to the meaning of the poem.

[From either Portuguese poesia concreta or German konkrete Dichtung.]

  "He (Bob Cobbing) was drawn to concrete poetry's ability to operate on the
   margins of language."
   Bob Cobbing (obituary); The Times (London, UK); Nov 7, 2002.

   "The main work is a series of three dozen extraordinary fabric collages,
   or miniquilts, stitched from clothing labels. Ms. (Berty) Skuber began
   by using labels from her own clothes, but most have been contributed by
   friends and strangers around the world who heard about her project. It
   is both an international collaboration and a labor-intensive species
   of concrete poetry, minutely composed but random, personal but
   unsentimental."
   Art Guide; The New York Times; Nov 1, 2002.

david, i read all of what jonathan posted re nader... i'll still
insist that if katherine harris is to blame for gore's failure to be
elected, and if the u.s. supreme court is to blame for gore's
failure, and if u.s. voters are to blame for gore's failure, and if
gore is to blame for gore's failure, nader is yet to blame for gore's
failure...

hey, it's ok with me if you want to go 3rd party to alter the
democratic party landscape... i mean, if you're that clear about your
motives, that's well and fine...

but you and i will have substantive disagreement if you tell me that
it's more important to alter the aforesaid landscape regardless
whether the dems are elected or the repubs (unless of course it's a
foregone conclusion that the dems will most certainly lose)...

the next election, like the last, is shaping up, as i see it, to be a
Major Struggle twixt right-wingers and (at best, sadly) centrist
democrats... if these are our choices, i'm not about to put my vote
behind the right-wingers, if even by default, just to push the dems
left... i think my rationale for doing same is pretty clear (if
certainly not crystal clear)... seems to me another 4 years of bush &
co. will put this country, and the globe, more squarely behind the 8
ball than it already is...

and while i'm no prophet of doom, this will mean (at least) an
escalating chance that something even worse may happen to us (locally
and globally) than what's being experienced at present, esp. by the
have nots...

btw, on another thread:  is it ok if i say, publicly, that i took
some pleasure, and am taking some pleasure, in seeing those statues
of hussein topple all across iraq?... even as the prospect of a (no
doubt nonsecular, this time 'round) democratic leadership emerging
from the ruins gives me the shakes...

best,

joe

Dear Poetics,

How's this for relief from the horrors of war?

I have a query, and I suspect someone on this list might know.  A few
months ago an obituary appeared about the artist who produced the Dogs
Playing Poker and similar paintings.  Does anyone know his name?  Does
someone have the obituary or can tell me the date of its appearance?

Thanks,

Nader haters,

Why is Nader, those who voted for Nader & the people who are "sick and tired of being sick and tired"(FLHamer) always to blame? Why not hold accountable the piss-ant pollchasers- "leaders" of the Democratic Party?

Gore? Oil interest Gore? The man who pushed for WTO sanctions against Mandela's South Africa for making AIDS drugs available? That's an alternative? Al Gore or some other "centrist democrat" will not alter the headlong drive for empire. This is a fact. Wipe the sleep from your eyes. The dream is over.

Democrat candidates are laughing at you while you hold your nose & vote for them. They know you don't believe in them, and they don't care. They still get what they want- liberal votes & corporate funding. Guess who they're listening to.

Too many people are tired of begging the hustlers for change. It's time (at least threaten)to walk away from them. We've gone crawling to them over & over again. They haven't delivered. Since you can't find a Democratic left- let them find you.

In the meantime, the grassroots are accessible. Third Party school boards, local councils & community organizations can be the beginnings of a dominant force. Maybe it sounds hokey, but it can obviously be effective. Ask Ralph Reed, someone who profoundly shaped Republican policy on the clout of an extremist outsider constituency.

Face it, keeping your finger crossed for a lefty Dem has not worked. It will not work any time soon. There will not be a benevolent change from the top. The course can only be altered by a shove from the bottom. Since the Jackasses are still edging in the photo-ops to be filmed between Bush & the flag- maybe Green is an answer, if not a utilizing force.

Gore is/was a righter-wing Clinton. BC militarized local police forces, signed the Crime Bill & ended welfare. What are you holding on to?

writing contest, "Women's Voices in War Zones"Dear friend,

We are writing to remind you of the May 1, 2003 deadline for our writing
contest, "Women's Voices in War Zones" (see announcement below) and to
ask you to spread the word, especially to people outside the United
States.  We are getting many more entries  from within the U.S. than
from other countries.

No doubt one reason for this is that we can only handle entries
submitted in English.  As a small, struggling, not-for-profit
organization, we simply do not have the resources to accept entries in
other languages, but will try to find a way to do so if we repeat the
contest in the future.

Another possible reason is that our mailing list is concentrated within
the U.S. If you have access to international e-lists, we specially
request you to circulate this notice widely, so that we can broaden the
scope of our conversations on war, terror, and security.

Some writers have misinterpreted our contest rules regarding copyright.
Please note: we will NOT retain exclusive copyright of any essay
submitted to us; entrants are free to use their essays in any form once
the contest is over. We do, however, need to have the right to reprint
these essays in our own media or use them for political or publicity
purposes, without having to contact an author each time. We do not
anticipate reproducing these essays for sale or in any other way
benefiting financially from them. As a writers' group, we are well
aware of the need to respect an author's ownership of her work and
reassure all those interested in the contest that we will not abuse the
copyright requirement.

Thank you for helping Women's WORLD publicize this important opportunity
for women the world over to express their opinions on living in war
zones.


Sincerely,


Meredith Tax

        ANNOUNCING A WRITING CONTEST: WOMEN'S VOICES IN WAR ZONES

Since Sept. 11, 2001 there has been constant public reference to  =
concepts of terror, war, and security, but little debate about their =
meaning, which differs from place to place and person to person.  And =
the voices of women and girls, both within the US and in the rest of the =
world, have been conspicuously absent from the discussion.

To bring forward women's ideas on this subject, and enable them to be =
heard in the public arena, Women's WORLD, a global free speech network =
of feminist writers,  is initiating a writing contest which will be =
co-sponsored by the The Nation Institute, whose mission is to defend =
freedom of expression and strengthen the independent media. The subject =
is Women's Voices in War Zones.

Eligibility:  All women are welcome to participate; age and citizenship =
are no barrier.  We are particularly interested in seeing work from =
writers, activists, students, and immigrants or refugees.

Rules:  Submissions must be previously unpublished personal essays of =
1000 words or less, in English, that address one or more of the =
following questions:

What does the term "war zone"  mean to you?  Do you live in a war zone =
or state of terror?  Is it personal or public?  Who is or are the =
aggressors?  How do you resist?  What keeps you going?  Where does your =
hope or security lie?  How do you imagine bringing this  terror to an =
end?  Does your government or society or family provide you with =
security or is it a source of  your unease?

We will read only one entry per person. =20

All entries must also include either a one page vita with contact =
information, or a short biographical statement with the writer's full =
name and contact information: mailing address, phone or fax numbers, and =
email address. =20
=20
Submissions can be sent by email to the following address: ratna =
@wworld.org; or by fax or post to Women' WORLD, 208 w. 30th St., #901, =
New York NY 10001.  fax 212-947-2973.  Email submissions are preferred.

Deadline:  Submissions must be received by 5 pm (Eastern Standard Time) =
on May 1, 2003.   Winners will be announced in early June.

Prizes:  Prizes will be given to women in three categories: 1) residents =
of the US; 2) residents of other countries; 3) immigrants or refugees in =
any country.

There will be three first prizes of $250, and three second prizes of =
$100.  Winning essays will be published on the The Nation website and =
the websites of Women's WORLD and its affiliates; announced to the =
press; and circulated to global email lists.

Copyright:  By sending us an essay, contestants automatically give =
Women's WORLD the right to publish it in any form and to license others =
to do so, whether or not the essay wins a prize.=20

Judges:  The judges will be Ammiel Alcalay, Paula Giddings and Katha =
Pollitt.

and Nellie Sachs, "But Look":

But look
but look
man breaks out
in the middle of the marketplace
can you hear his pulses beating
and the great city
on rubber tires
girded about his body--
for fate
has muffled
the wheel of time--
lifts itself
on the rhythm of his breathing.

Glassy displays
broken raven-eyes
sparkle
the chimneys fly black flags
at the grave of air

But man
has said *Ah*
and climbs
a straight candle
into the night.

Dear List Members:

Apologies for "cross-posting," but in case anyone would like to stop by,
there will be a book launch for

All Poets Welcome: The Lower East Side Poetry Scene in the 1960s
(University of California Press, March 2003)

and

What is Poetry: Conversations with the American Avant-Garde
(Teachers & Writers Collaborative Press, April 2003)

"All Poets..." is a cultural/literary history of the poetry community in
NYC during the 1960s, and features sections on the coffee-house reading
culture (Le Metro, Les Deux Megots, the Poetry Project at St. Mark's
Church), magazines of the era (Ed Sanders' "Fuck You/a magazine of the
arts," Berrigan's "C," Lorenzo Thomas's and David Henderson's "Umbra,"
etc.) and so on. There's a CD with readings by Ceravolo, O'Hara, Notley,
Mayer, Waldman, Warsh, and more.  Books will be available for sale, and
I'll try and get discounted copies.

"What is Poetry" is a selection of interviews I've held with poets over
the years - Ashbery, Creeley, Mayer, Mullen, F. Howe, Jarnot, Lorenzo
Thomas, and more.

The launch is

Monday, April 28th at 7 PM at

Teachers & Writers Collaborative
5 Union Square West
(between 14th & 15th Streets, above Staples)
7th Floor

I've been perplexed lately about where I was and what
I was doing the last time we were bombing Iraq during
the '90-'91 Gulf War.  The only thing I can remember
is the Kuwaiti oil fields being set on fire.

And then, the other night, when I was in a "The
Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!" panic
and trying to photograph all the contents of my
Merzbau to preserve it from duct tape,...

...I came upon these artworks, photographed and
uploaded to

http://neoplasticistnyt.tripod.com/

Thirty-three New York Times front pages from that
period, painted over in Mondrian Neo-Plasticism, with
the gridwork and red/yellow/blue color rectangles
following the layout of the newspaper.

Some are in acrylic; some are in tempera; some of the
Neo-Plasticist white field is gesso.

"Art is higher than reality, and has no direct
relation to reality. Between the physical sphere and
the ethereal sphere there is a frontier where our
senses stop functioning. Nevertheless, the ether
penetrates the physical sphere and acts upon it. Thus
the spiritual penetrates the real. But for our senses
these are two different things---the spiritual and the
material.  To approach the spiritual in art, one will
make as little use as possible of reality"

Thanks!  Once I got the name, I scouted Google, and was amazed at all the
places where you can order prints, but there's really only a sketch for a
biography.  One place comments that Coolidge was a major influence of Andy
Warhol, and that his parodic realism was way ahead of his time.  In any
case, I'm going to hunt some more -- I'm intrigued how such a guy in
Rochester, NY comes up with the idea and what happened to him.  So, if
anyone knows anything about him, pass it on.  I will add his story to the
many lesser knowns who actually make up the world, such as the man who
invented the shower curtain, the unknowns who decided it was proper to
smile when being photographed, etc.

Woof,

I'm simply observing that there are poets who everyone agrees are great
talents, "geniuses" even, but who produce works that (everyone also agrees)
are pretty inconsequential.  Isn't that true?

I think this phenomenon of brilliance wedded to inconsequence reflects a
persistent uncertainty about what the ambitions of poets ought to be
(beyond having an academic career, it seems).

As a poet of the 1950s, Ashbery shares with many members of his generation
an extremely modest, self-limiting idea of literary ambition.  In
interviews, he is frank about the ephemerality of his productions.

For Muldoon, poetry writing seems primarily to be a means to demonstrate
skill.  As a formal innovator, I think he goes way beyond what usually
passes for "formal innovation."  Yet how often does he rise above being a
writer of exercises?  (Indeed, how could anyone rise above that level who
publishes as often as he does?)  I wish I could find on-line the
quasi-sestina he published in the New Yorker not long ago, the elegy called
"The Last Time I Saw Chris."  It illustrates what I think is his tendency
to use odd formal structures to compensate for a lack of clear emotional
necessity.

It is strange, this mixture of pretentiousness and happy triviality that
characterizes contemporary poetics, and also strange that one often seems
to open the door for the other: a happily inconsequential poet and
journalist like Ashbery opens the door for a school of academic Marxists
dedicated to smashing subjectivity, who in turn open the door for the next
group.  It's as if no one can find the right scale.

it seems to me that too many Americans have too much to lose,
and the Democrats have been wise to this for awhile now.  Clinton
especially REALLY KNEW what so-called "left" Democrats were all
about, the kind of folks who talked a good talk in the name of the
poor, in the name of racial and gender minorities, but would be
the first to call the cops if a homeless person camped out on
their doorstep.

Nader and ESPECIALLY La Duke never ever made such people comfortable,
mainly because they spoke quite freely about the unfair distribution
of wealth in this country, and about HOW to make it a little fairer.
LaDuke in particular spoke rather PASSIONATELY about Mexico, the new
Hell on Earth created by American corporate interests, made possible
by Mr. Clinton and his rather wooden side kick.

Nader and LaDuke are for the silent majority (too fucking busy
scraping a living), and NOT for the vocal "left" Democrats.

Bell Hooks recently said it best:
"Radical young politicos from privileged backgrounds who had
sought to intervene on oppressive capitalism became adults who
were eager to find and keep their place in the existing
economic system.  And if this system was fast turning our
nation into a world of haves and have-nots with little in

Many academics think subjectivity is complicated; they have theories about
something they (no doubt pretentiously) call "the subject": its self-presence,
coherence, or lack thereof.  Why is it strange that such accounts might be
applied to the poetry of Ashbery?  What you call his inconsequentiality is one
way of describing his poetic relation to his own subjectivity, the way being in
the world feels to him.  Would you rather he talked like an artist in a 'major
motion picture'?

Hello

I'm glad that a discourse of some sort on this
issue is taking shape, because although it may
seem inconsequential and sour-grapesy now, it's
going to get a lot more important come election
time 2004. The way I see it, the kind of
soul-searching and consolidating the Reps. did so
well during the Clinton years, especially after
their meltdown in the 96 elections, still hasn't
even begun to happen on the other side of the
aisle.

As Frank pointed out, extremists like Ralph Reed
were able to significantly shape policy on the
right and fashion a platform far to the right of
anything Nixon/Reagan/Bush I had ever dreamed up.
How were they able to do it? At the grass-roots
level, with phone and mailing campaigns, winning
little battles with moderates over party
positions, infiltrating the power structure
without resorting to the buffoonery of actually
running for office (which had been their major
mistake in previous primary elections). (And while
we're on the subject, there was an excellent
article in a recent Harper's on "The Family" -- a
shadow organization of religious nuts who have
connections with corporations and corrupt
governments all over the world, and who exercise
enormous influence over select Reps. AND dems --
you can't make shit up this spooky.)

So although it's not as sexy as getting arrested
in a protest or submitting a poem to an anti-war
journal, it's absolutely essential to get out and
pound the pavement for candidates you can support
at the local level, make phone calls, write
letters, find out how you can be effective in
influencing policy, even if it has all the effect
of a rain drop on the hull of an aircraft carrier.

As I stated before, my vote for Nader in
California didn't mean much -- I don't know HOW I
would have voted if I'd lived in New Hampshire or
any of the other swing states. But my disgust for
Gore and the Democratic party is such that I can't
guarantee it would have outweighed my revulsion to
Bush et al. in any case, and forced me to vote for
the former. And to clarify -- I was never trying
to exonerate Nader from any culpability in the
election fiasco. I was only pointing out that
there are at least a dozen very good reasons Gore
"lost," and ten of those lay at no one's feet but
his own.

DH

Subject: Re: Nader & LaDuke


it seems to me that too many Americans have too
much to lose,
and the Democrats have been wise to this for
awhile now.  Clinton
especially REALLY KNEW what so-called "left"
Democrats were all
about, the kind of folks who talked a good talk in
the name of the
poor, in the name of racial and gender minorities,
but would be
the first to call the cops if a homeless person
camped out on
their doorstep.

Nader and ESPECIALLY La Duke never ever made such
people comfortable,
mainly because they spoke quite freely about the
unfair distribution
of wealth in this country, and about HOW to make
it a little fairer.
LaDuke in particular spoke rather PASSIONATELY
about Mexico, the new
Hell on Earth created by American corporate
interests, made possible
by Mr. Clinton and his rather wooden side kick.

Nader and LaDuke are for the silent majority (too
fucking busy
scraping a living), and NOT for the vocal "left"
Democrats.

Bell Hooks recently said it best:
"Radical young politicos from privileged
backgrounds who had
sought to intervene on oppressive capitalism
became adults who
were eager to find and keep their place in the
existing
economic system.  And if this system was fast
turning our
nation into a world of haves and have-nots with
little in
between, they wanted to remain in the ranks of
the privileged."

yes, i agree with david, important to have this conversation, or i
wouldn't be posting in as i get set to haul my ass off a thousand
miles east (in 3 months), in search of a steady academic paycheck...

for the record, and i don't think anyone said this about yours truly,
but i'm no nader hater... not by a long shot... i think he's done
some great public service, more so than most in politics... he pissed
me off during the last election, yes, but that doesn't mean i hate
the guy... i use that word "hate" when i express a sentiment like, "i
hate hussein"...

we don't know, of course, and will never know, how the u.s. might
have fared under gore instead of bush... that's something i wish i
could know, but in any case am happy (for a number of reasons) that
gore won't be running in 04... remember what dick morris (who hates
the clintons these days) once said about gore?... that he was a most
chameleon-like creature once the spotlight was on him, but that
one-on-one he was completely stable, likable, and committed... in
short, that he just didn't have a solid public persona, but that he
was ultimately a much more stand-up guy than william jefferson (not
that anyone ought to trust morris, but there's at least some truth
here i think... for some this will simply be splitting hairs, i know,
and in any case personalities are less the matter perhaps than are
the respective machines)...

surely the repubs have had an election strategy in place ever since
they started fiddling with districting in the south... i.e., they
didn't just up and mobilize the christian coalition (if that
too)---they played some pretty savvy politics (i'd write dirty
politics, but politics IS dirty)... and they did so, let's recall,
with tons o capital... now the right persistently tries to argue that
it doesn't have e.g. "union money," like the left... but the repubs
have far greater access to corporate funding than do the dems---we
all know this, or should know this... and money talks... real
campaign finance reform would be great, sure, but money talks, and
will in the next election, no way around that...

now if the next election begins to shape up like the last, what do we
do? ("we" used very deliberately here)... rerun that third party
scenario like we did last time 'round?...

i hope not...

i'm living in liberal land right now, perhaps the most liberal (and
wealthy) region in the intermountain west (boulder county,
colorado---along with several other listmates), and the past 4 years
have indeed been a nice lesson in the differences twixt being left
and being liberal... as i recall, nader was either at 9 or 11% of the
vote in the town of boulder---which is to say, from where i sit, a
fair number of liberals (along with some leftists, sure) went for
nader... just to set the record straight-er here... i don't have
access to hard data on this, but from where i sit, it was precisely
the crew that craig is railing against that went nader (not gore)...
to have gone gore would have been perceived, by many around here, as
an establishment vote...

you'll have to trust me on the latter, i suppose, b/c i'm
characterizing many of the nader votes as liberal, and not left...
but i had my debates at the time with many of these folks (incl.
students on my extremely well-heeled campus), about gore losing to
bush b/c of nader... in point of fact, most (though not all) of the
folks i'm referring too had enough disposable income so that it
wouldn't matter a damn if bush won---not a damn...

almost in fact the working definition of liberal, not left... nothing
to lose, and having nothing to lose makes you believe that you ought
to throw your vote where you think your principles lie (so to
speak)... remember:  money can insulate you from just about
anything... i really enjoy it, too, when someone 22 years old tells
me that they voted for nader, in between telling me that they're
planning to spend a year off after school "traveling around the
world"... or when the nader vote is coming from someone who lives in
a million dollar home...

this sorta thing really makes my day, as i say, even though i
appreciate the (is it?) idealism... but then again, i have my ideals
too...

don't take my word for it, come to think of it:  nader did poorly
last election among people of color, women, the formally uneducated
and the elderly (right?)... in boulder---a largely white educated
young-ish and green green town---he did real well, relatively
speaking... oh---boulder is extremely monied, too, did i say that?
(median housing just cracked the $400,000 mark)... now do we know
whether those with money, or who come from money, voted for ralph?...
no (i don't anyway)... is it likely that the general presence of
money around here was a factor... i think so... does the fact that
e.g. the uneducated didn't vote for nader mean that you shouldn't
have voted for nader?... certainly not...

but if you *did* vote for nader, and you are white, and educated, and
young, and male, you might want to think over what's at stake here...
maybe (i say maybe) you ought to think this over in terms of what
john g. gunnell used to talk about as political ontology... i know
i'll be thinking things over in such terms---and you know where i
stand... hell, if it looks like the dems are gonna get killed, i'll
probably throw my vote at nader (if he runs)... but if it's tight, i
don't think so...

so in my 2nd and last post of the day, i'd like only to insist that
(1) we follow the money and (2) we consider whether voting for a dem
comprises a lack of courage (which i think is nonsense, to be candid)
or whether it's possible that some of us who go dem are scared
shitless of the alternative---and not simply for ourselves, either...

best,

joe

Subject:      Relics & phonemes
MIME-Version: 1.0

The full text of an address I'm giving Monday for a conference here in
Tomsk can be read at

http://hypobololemaioi.com/pages/bio5.html

and though there isn't much there for poetry, it's intended as a
response to the question, "The eyes of the world blink from nervous
exhaustion, while Benjamin's reading of the relics turns up more and
more burnt remains. Is this fate? Or can the bones be ground into
phonemes?"

Who can claim they speak or claim their speech when it is the space
which speaks through them, whether it is a discussion list or
conference auditorium? The title of Monday's conference is "Language
and the Multi-Cultural Space: Aspects of Theory and Practice." One of
the members on the organizing committee for this space is the English
Language Officer from the Public Affairs Section of the American
Embassy in Moscow. Another (American) speaker is from the Bureau of
Education and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Dept. of State in
Vladivostok.

It is hardly likely that I'll read the Punctuation Exercise as obvious
and innocuous as it must sound in the space of this discussion list,
and I wonder whether the freedom of speech practiced on this list
depends at least partly on the single-language domination of English?
If there were other languages present here, would it change anyone's
language? Do American poets have an ethic imperative to communicate
internationally, if the language of protest were to reach beyond
itself?

Benjamin also wrote that English is the language of accountants.

When this English is removed from its native environment, even in the
institutional sphere of culture, the pressure becomes something like
the description of walking on layers of ice in the "Moscow" essay
published in a new translation by Harvard in 1999. (The Chaucer pages
at this university are comparatively general, even superficial,
compared to similar sites at philological departments in Europe).

A statue of Mandelstam was raised in Vladivostok last year. The story
appears for several minutes on the national news. "I alone in Russia
work with my voice." A cryptic utterance? When the voice is removed
from the environment which constructed it, how the simplest words
begin to disturb, for they are always heard in a condition of
difference. In the cross-cultural space (the translation area)
everything depends on communication. Translation may be that labor
which shows one language how to appropriate the other.

From the text of the address:

There is a linguistic question here about states and actions expressed
by verbs in English, not to mention the shifting functions between
verb and noun, which often leave the form of the word unchanged, so I
posed the problem to myself this way: How can the windows be said to
be anything except windows, since the action of painting them has not
made them anything except windows which have been painted out? The
action of painting them, in other words, has not changed the state of
the windows. They are still windows, painted or unpainted. As a native
speaker of English, and as a poet who uses this language, I was very
interested in my need for the passive to be expressed in the active
tense, as in, "Workers had painted out the windows," and it was this
need for an active subject which produced my incorrect use of the past
perfect, since I heard the action of the subject even when the subject
had been omitted, and so I gave priority to the action and not the
state. Native and non-native teachers of English know very well how
relentless the subject-verb-object relationship is in this language,
and for the native speaker sometimes, the domination of this structure
can interfere with using alternative, even theoretical,
constructions. The story of this sentence ended, if it can even be
said to have ended, in my growing fascination with the study of
English as an object, even though my subjectivity is immersed in the
habits and reflexes of my native language.

One of the greatest insights into the study of English has been given
to me this year by the opportunity of working with a Russian teacher
on the faculty of this university on a lecture course in the History
of English. Often I feel more like a student than a colleague, since
the discipline of Historical Linguistics, as any survey of the subject
will show, has suffered in Western and especially American
universities, partly in response to theories advanced by scholars
working in the related fields of socio-linguistics and applied
linguistics, and partly as an effect of the popularity of cultural
studies. Old English in many universities can be used to fulfill the
foreign language requirement for a PhD, since the synthetic structure
of this earlier English is all but foreign to the user of Modern
English. In the monographs used for the course at this university,
written by a Russian linguist from Tomsk, there are linguistic
practice exercises in the pronunciation of Old English as well as
Middle English, and analytical exercises in grammatical and lexical
features belonging to these periods. Sometimes I feel as though I am
watching the English language being preserved at the very moment in
history when internet technology is producing a rapid expansion and
transformation of this language in the continuous present of
electronic communications.

To end on a humorous note, I would like to read to you from page 121
the Longman Diagnostic and Editing Tests which is used with the
Longman 2003 English Handbooks by freshman composition students at
many universities in the United States. This particular Exercise is
for using End Punctuation, which reflects the priority given in
Anglo-American education to the visual use and appearance of the
language over the communicative paradigm of the speech act.

Instructions: Select the letter of the choice that correctly
punctuates the sentence.

1. Asked what word came to mind when he thought of the Internet, one
third-world subscriber responded, "Colonialism"

a. "Colonialism"!       b. "Colonialism!"       c. "Colonialism?"

2. Why would the Internet, a collection of more than 10 million
computers that moves data among almost 200 nations, be considered a
form of colonialism

a. colonialism.         b. colonialism!         c. colonialism?

3. The answer, according to some critics of the system, is that the
Internet exports the English language (carrying with it immense
cultural power)

a. language.            b. power.)              c. power).

4. Complaining that it is easier to download English translations of
Russian classics than Russian versions, Anatoly Voronov asks, "Why
shouldn't Pushkin or Lermontov be more available in Russian

a. Russian?"            b. Russian"?            c. Russian?".

5. Voronov argues that the need to use English over the Internet,
divides the world into new sorts of "haves and have-nots

a. have-nots".          b. have-nots."          c. have-nots"

6. But isn't Christian Huitema, a member of the board of the Internet
Society, correct when he says, "The effect of the Internet is to make
information available at a minimum cost and effort

a. effort."             b. effort"?             c. effort?"

7. The need to use English, according to this view, is a small price,
indeed, to pay for access to the major libraries of the world

a. world!               b. world.!              c. world?

Thanks!  Once I got the name, I scouted Google, and was amazed at all the
places where you can order prints, but there's really only a sketch for a
biography.  One place comments that Coolidge was a major influence of Andy
Warhol, and that his parodic realism was way ahead of his time.  In any
case, I'm going to hunt some more -- I'm intrigued how such a guy in
Rochester, NY comes up with the idea and what happened to him.  So, if
anyone knows anything about him, pass it on.  I will add his story to the
many lesser knowns who actually make up the world, such as the man who
invented the shower curtain, the unknowns who decided it was proper to
smile when being photographed, etc.

with equipment not of my making,
and in relative warmth and comfort -
possessing the luxurious ability

"Art is higher than reality, and has no direct
relation to reality. Between the physical sphere and
the ethereal sphere there is a frontier where our
senses stop functioning. Nevertheless, the ether
penetrates the physical sphere and acts upon it. Thus
the spiritual penetrates the real. But for our senses
these are two different things---the spiritual and the
material.  To approach the spiritual in art, one will
make as little use as possible of reality"

Subject: Perforations 26: Kismet, my love ...

Kismet, my love=8A
Perforations 26

Guest editor - Charles Kriel <journal@kriel.tv>
Senior editor - Robert Cheatham <zeug@pd.org>
http://www.perforate.org/

Theme:
Kismet, my love=8A is concerned with the growing phenomena of the
mediation of personality and the marketing of the self via new tools
for communication: text and multimedia messaging; 3G video phones;
mobile and stationary email; web pages; web logs; networked software
agents and others. It is concerned with both the technical workings
of any new innovations with potential use in this context, as well as
the social implications and the theoretical issues surrounding them.
As Perforations is an e-journal with impact beyond the theoretical,
we are interested in works that express their ideas through a variety
of media, including sound, video, visual art, performance, etc., as
well as the written paper.

George Myerson's Heidegger, Habermas and the Mobile Phone, is a one
possible starting point in this exploration. To quote John Bird on
Myerson: [M]obile phone communication is, essentially, the provision
of information through a technology which does not really require a
person on the other end of the handset.

The MIT AI Lab robot, Kismet, built by Dr. Cynthia Breazeal, is
another source. Although Kismet speaks nonsense, it will engage you
in conversation. Through gesture and vocal inflection, it will make
clear that it understands that you have said something to it, it will
speak non-demanding nonsense back to you, and then indicate that it
is your turn to speak again. It insists only that you keep it at the
right level of stimulation, and that you keep a reasonable distance.

Finally, blogs play a role in this work. Certain Frankfurt School
theorists critiqued the wearing of one's personality externally and
materially, whether through fashion or some other inscription into
the corps of collective expression; the more democratic the language
of expression, the more banal. Blogs, which typically express
individual personality via a collection of links and a display of
friendships (I am what I reference), are ripe for evaluation within
this framework, whether pro-Adorno, anti-, or viewed within more
contemporary theoretical parameters.

This particular trend of expression of the individual via selection
from the collective belies a drift in culture in general: the
arrogation of the curator over the artist, the DJ over the musician,
the blogger over the journalist. Kismet, my love=8A privileges neither
voice, but seeks to evaluate this shift in culture.

interestingly enough, i was just watching the remake of ~the thomas
crown affair~ last night (with brosnan and russo), when in one scene,
it's ascertained that there's a 'ghost' painting behind a counterfeit
monet...

best i can tell from the glance we get at it, the painting is "dogs
playing poker"...

Dear Joe, thanks for the lessons in Political Ontology and such, but i STILL don't see how you can justify asking ANYONE in a Democracy to vote ANY WAY but by their conscience.  it's really, in the end, up to the candidates to PROVE themselves.  it is very interesting how much Al Gore DIDN'T want those debates with Nader.  yeah, it was much easier to debate Dumbo mini Bush.  Nader wasn't even allowed into the audience while the debates were going on, even though he had a PAID ticket stub.  he was THE ONLY person forbidden into the televised debates who had a PAID ticket stub, made to watch from the fucking Green Room!

if you're SO interested in SAVING the Democrats why don't you go do a little Political Ontological missionary work on the Republicans.  how you vote is up to you, and i'm glad you shared with us your feelings about why and who and what comes where for you to make your decisions about who to vote for.  everybody has their own recipe, and that's what makes this country so fantastic in the end.  but me, i din't give two shits if they hoisted Gore up on the gallows and THREATENED to hang him if i voted for Nader, i'd STILL vote for Nader.

by the way, those demographics you shared, the ones about who voted for Nader, i suppose statistics can be grabbed out of thin air after all.  i know PLENTY of lesbians of color who voted for Nader, a bunch a drag queens, in FACT there's a WHOLE group of drag queens (what do they call their group?  GLAMERICANS?  something like that) and radical faeries, a VERY LARGE population of dykes and fags in their 50s who helped fill Madison Square Garden to support him.  in fact, Patti Smith MADE A POINT of saying on stage when singing at that benefit concert for Nader HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE were in the audience, as she said, "THESE are all the shapes and colors of the what American is about."  your attempt to NARROW the chute we're sliding through in support of FREEDOM from a (too old) 2 party system is really pointless.

go dem baby, knock your pretty self out,
ain't no one standing in your way Joe,
love, love, and yet more love,
CAConrad

Firefight at Palestine Hotel

31 minutes ago — No quagmire, but still some questions.
The censorship begins inside the heavily armored tank if it
is placed correctly. To err on the side of caution whenever
practical, classrooms were filled with hundreds of crates

of grenade launchers, hunkered down in their homes by a wife
and two children hoping that peace would prevail. Critical questions
a hundred flights up? Brides stripped bare by their bachelors?
Coalition forces sound sirens again in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.

Knew there were journalists there and ordered a return volley
anyway. Media march to war, and my very bones sweated.
Classrooms were filled with a lull following an evening
bombardment. Ourselves with ourselves. Told reporters that

after a lull following an evening bombardment. Rifles and rocket-
propelled grenades reduced to a line in a sonnet, if it is placed
correctly. Journalists warned of the danger that combat may lie
ahead, can injure or kill. The commander knew that journalists were

there, inside the heavily armed tank, amid hundreds of cartons
of leaflets, trying by any means to seize the offensive, win the peace.

On looting the National Museum of Iraq: 50,000 artifacts from 7,000 years of
history lost in 48 hours.

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/international/worldspecial/12CND-BAGH.html

I find outrageous and unbelievable that U.S. troops would be allowed to
stand-by and permit this disaster to happen - to essentially permit the
destruction of one of the  prime repositories the world's earliest history.
At best one can pray that the objects are not destroyed and that vigilance
abounds at the borders for dealers in these artifacts.
Cultural terrorism is as old as the hills - including the burning of
libraries of which I suspect we will also soon have witness - a form of
cutting the tongue out of the enemy. Since these are Iraqis who are
performing this cultural self-destruction - and for what angry, desperate
and self-serving reasons we can probably imagine - yet, by permitting it to
openly happen, whether it be ransacking hospitals, museums, whatever  - the
United States Government has shown itself complicit and accountable for
contributing to these crimes.

Or as Secretary of War Donald Rumsfeld put out the Government's apparent
point of view yesterday:
Think what's happened in our cities when we've had riots and problems and
looting. Stuff happens! But in terms of what's going on in that country, it
is a fundamental misunderstanding to see those images over and over and over
again of some boy walking out with a vase and say, "Oh, my goodness, you
didn't have a plan." That's nonsense. They know what they're doing. And
they're doing a terrific job. And it's untidy. And freedom's untidy. And
free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things.
They're also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that's
what's going to happen here. . . .


I personally feel a deep shame - and I am sure I am far from alone - for
what has happened in our name under the watch of "Occupation." In this case
I hope the Museums in this country and around the world - as well as the
Galleries and dealers that they may stand to profit from these thefts - will
take the lead in condemning the U.S. failure to act against these crimes
and, most important now, take the lead in supporting Iraqi efforts to
recover and restore the stolen treasures of this Museum and possibly other
museums and libraries through out Iraq.

A very sad moment.

Not to worry, Stephen. Halliburton and Bechtel have already been
awarded contracts to replace all those artifacts with facsimiles so
accurate you won't be able to tell the difference. Hey, and they'll
get a few $billion apiece to do the job. The past is before us. Just
you wait.

{    On looting the National Museum of Iraq: 50,000 artifacts from 7,000 years of
{    history lost in 48 hours.
{

{
{    I find outrageous and unbelievable that U.S. troops would be allowed to
{    stand-by and permit this disaster to happen - to essentially permit the
{    destruction of one of the  prime repositories the world's earliest history.
{    At best one can pray that the objects are not destroyed and that vigilance
{    abounds at the borders for dealers in these artifacts.
{    Cultural terrorism is as old as the hills - including the burning of
{    libraries of which I suspect we will also soon have witness - a form of
{    cutting the tongue out of the enemy. Since these are Iraqis who are
{    performing this cultural self-destruction - and for what angry, desperate
{    and self-serving reasons we can probably imagine - yet, by permitting it to
{    openly happen, whether it be ransacking hospitals, museums, whatever  - the
{    United States Government has shown itself complicit and accountable for
{    contributing to these crimes.
{
{    Or as Secretary of War Donald Rumsfeld put out the Government's apparent
{    point of view yesterday:
{    Think what's happened in our cities when we've had riots and problems and
{    looting. Stuff happens! But in terms of what's going on in that country, it
{    is a fundamental misunderstanding to see those images over and over and over
{    again of some boy walking out with a vase and say, "Oh, my goodness, you
{    didn't have a plan." That's nonsense. They know what they're doing. And
{    they're doing a terrific job. And it's untidy. And freedom's untidy. And
{    free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things.
{    They're also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that's
{    what's going to happen here. . . .
{
{
{    I personally feel a deep shame - and I am sure I am far from alone - for
{    what has happened in our name under the watch of "Occupation." In this case
{    I hope the Museums in this country and around the world - as well as the
{    Galleries and dealers that they may stand to profit from these thefts - will
{    take the lead in condemning the U.S. failure to act against these crimes
{    and, most important now, take the lead in supporting Iraqi efforts to
{    recover and restore the stolen treasures of this Museum and possibly other
{    museums and libraries through out Iraq.
{
{    A very sad moment.

>>
>>A DIPLOMATIC MEMO
>>by Silver Donald Cameron
>>
>>To: Ambassador Paul Cellucci
>>Embassy of the United States of America
>>490 Sussex Drive
>>Ottawa, Ontario
>>
>>Dear Mr. Ambassador:
>>Your recent remarks about Canada's policy with respect to Iraq were
>>inaccurate, inappropriate and offensive. Prime Minister Chretien is
>>maintaining a delicate balance between US pressure and Canadian opinion
>>- a familiar position for Canadian Prime Ministers - and he will not tell
>>you to go pound sand. But someone should.
>>
>>Fundamentally, you argue that the United States would instantly come to
>>the aid of Canada in an emergency, and Canada should therefore participate
>>in your ill-advised attack on Iraq.
>>
>>"There is no security threat to Canada that the United States would not
>>be ready, willing and able to help with," you are quoted as saying. "There
>>would be no debate. There would be no hesitation. We would be there for
>>Canada, part of our family."
>>
>>Codswallop. And that's diplomatic.
>>
>>The primary threat to Canadian security has always been the United
>>States.  A monument in Quebec honours my earliest Canadian ancestor for
>>repelling an invasion from your home state of Massachusetts in 1690. The
>>very first instance of military co-operation among the Thirteen Colonies
>>occurred in 1745 under the leadership of James Shirley, your predecessor as
>>Governor of Massachusetts, whose army invaded Nova Scotia and captured the
>>Fortress of Louisbourg. Thirty years later, during the American Revolution,
>>your privateers sacked our ports. We were at war once more in 1812-15. The
>>birth of Canada in 1867 was prompted by fears of a US invasion. That's why
>>our railroad runs along the Gulf of St. Lawrence, far from the US border.
>>Do you remember "manifest destiny," the 1840's US doctrine which held
>>that your country had a God-given mission to rule all of North America? Do
>>you remember "Fifty-four-forty or fight," the slogan which rallied
>>Americans to threaten an invasion in 1902 over the Alaska boundary? Yours is
>>the only country which has ever invaded ours, and it would do so again in a
>>wink if it thought its interests here were seriously threatened.
>  >
>  >And how does your sentimental mantra of perpetual willingness to spring
>  >to our assistance apply to the First World War, which we entered in
>  >1914, while you stayed out for three years? We went to war against Hitler in
>>1939, while you were moved to join your sister democracies only after
>>the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor two years later. A million Canadians
>>fought in World War II, and 45,000 died. We need no lectures from Americans
>>about the defence of liberty and democracy.
>>
>>Nevertheless, despite the strains of our history, we are probably as close
>>as any two nations in the world. Many Canadians -- I am one -- have
>>family members who are American citizens. Our two nations fought together
>>not only in two World Wars, but also to repel the invasions of South Korea
>>in 1949 and Kuwait in 1991. And when great catastrophe strikes without
>>warning, our people have indeed been there for each other. As Governor of
>>Massachusetts, you must have been present at the lighting of the Christmas
>>tree in Boston each year - an annual gift from Nova Scotia to commemorate
>>the immediate and massive assistance of Massachusetts after the Halifax
>>Explosion in 1917.
>>
>>Our chance to reciprocate came on September 11, 2001, when Canadian
>>communities took in, on an instant's notice, 40,000 passengers from US
>>planes forced down by the terrorist attacks. Halifax alone hosted 7,200. We
>>housed them in our homes and schools and churches, fed them and comforted
>>them and treated them as family. We probably gave more immediate and
>>practical assistance to Americans than any other country. Yet when your
>>President later thanked the nations for their help, he did not mention
>  >Canada.
>>
>>The Iraq conflict, however, is not an unforeseen disaster, but a deliberate
>>choice. Your President has squandered a worldwide outpouring of sympathy

Mime-Version: 1.0

This was linked from Arts Journal <http://www.artsjournal.com> when I
checked it this morning:
<http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/21/apr03/ormsby.htm>

It's remarkable that someone writing in the New Criterion is willing
to admit there's anything he doesn't understand, but Eric Ormsby
makes much of the fact that he was inspired early on by listening to
an album of recordings of poetry in languages he didn't understand.
He doesn't, quite, say that he hates speech, though he comes close
once or twice.

Following a lede about an unnamed (and quite possibly conceptual)
Iraqi professor of English who 40 years ago posited that Shakespeare
was an Arabic mariner originally named Shaykh Zubayr, Ormsby ends up
far less unexpectedly (this is the New Criterion, after all) praising
Geoffrey Hill at great length.

    In the first week of the war, there were a
number of reports of the out break of insurrectionary
activity in Basra. These accounts of Shiite rebellion
were then dismissed by Al-Jazeera reporters on the
ground as UNTRUE and baseless.

    These reports were intended by the British Command
to FOMENT an insurrection.  El Jazeera's dismissal of these in
real time eventually led to the unecessary deaths of
a number of British Soldiers and countless civilians.
Psychological pressure, false rumour, wishful thinkin'
fog and bubba meisa are the tools of war.

    In this and a number of other instances El-Jazeera was an
active combatant, not a nuetral, and thus fair game. What comes back, come back...once upon an only tenure time...drn..

craig, not giving anyone any "lessons," again, just to be clear... i
*am* trying to suggest ways to think about why we vote who we vote
for---and if what i suggest is old news, the better for that... the
nader demographics speak for themselves---they're not a matter of
what you may have seen at the voter booths personally, as i was
trying to drive home by saying "don't take my word for it"... i wish
in fact i had better, more accurate stats, and if anyone does, i'll
be happy to stand corrected...

again, i thought it was wrong not to let nader into the
debates---completely wrong... but this isn't a reason to vote for
him, again (or, to my way of thinking, to have voted against gore)...
and yeah, i like patti smith lots too, but i don't necessarily turn
to her for political advice...

and i suppose i can't hope to change anyone's mind, either... but
yeah, i AM asking that voters stop to consider what they think
they're accomplishing with their vote, and for whom... i find the
nader folks---and again, to be candid, your post is some
representative of this---err in their enthusiasms, which often strike
me as evangelicalisms... it's nice to be passionate about a
candidate, sure (i've been there occasionally), but i'm still
concerned e.g. about folks who are dirt poor (a few of whom are in my
family, no shit)... no condescension intended or implied (wrt these
folks) but they won't be voting nader, and not b/c they don't
understand his platform, either...

as i suggested at the beginning of this thread, i knew that talking
about this, on this list, would only generate a mild shitstorm---like
anything else worth talking about on this list... i suppose now we
have to say, unfortunately, what?---that we each haven't budged in
our perspectives?... well, listening to the pro-nader perspective,
again, *has* helped me to think more about the larger political
domain, the reasons why voters vote as they do... writing a few posts
of my own *has* given me the opportunity to find a better way to
articulate my thoughts about the 00 election... but no, i haven't
heard anything that's really changed my mind about my voting
strategy... and i can only assume the situation is much the same on
the other end of the string...

how to forge anything like a coalition on the left given the latter
reality is quite beyond me... so i'll sign off on this thread for
now, and leave that one for others to ponder, as i ponder it mself...

peace,

joe

Subject:      On the Mysteriousness of Cats
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

On the Mysteriousness of Cats


The intermediary phenomenology of the cat. Consider the vector

rabbit <--> cat <--> dog .

There are three positions; rabbit/dog link by totality - the impervious
rabbit, and salivating dog. The dog responds more or less fully to human
communication; the rabbit, almost not at all. The rabbit exists in a world
dominated by muteness, inexpressivity; the dog, in a world of excessive
emotion. A 'happy' dog is almost always recognized as such. The dog is
cultivated by the male - "a dog is man's best friend." A dog accompanies
the man on the hunt for the rabbit. The man-dog is preyer; the rabbit is
prey. The dog eats; the rabbit is eaten. The rabbit is read as 0; the dog
as 1. The rabbit is fodder; the man-dog a double-prosthesis. The rabbit is
an idea; the dog, a psychology. The dog is an accompaniment within the
aegis of instrumental reason; the rabbit, consigned to both the natural
and inert. The rabbit is used by man; the man-dog, a function of totality.

The cat is intermediary. The cat is mute, but expressive; its expressivity
is by and large instinctual. The dog and rabbit are understood; the cat is
the locus of projections and introjections - the locus of jectivity. The
cat is feminine/feline; the rabbit pays no attention, the dog full, and
the cat partial. If the man-dog is an object for itself, and rabbit, an
object in-itself, the cat is a part-object, partial-object, recognizing
neither object nor others, rather recognizing in part objects and others.
A cat is the site of dreamwork, fantasm; it is necessarily incomprehensib-
le. The cat is feared as neither tool/function or food; it problematizes
human communication. A cat appears contented, but its purr is still not
understood; machines reproduce what might be considered the language of
dogs translated into human speech, and a rabbit is of limited vocality.
The cat, in the intermediary or problematic position of women in relation
to male ration/phallocracy, refuses interpretation, and worse, refuses
through its ignoring of human labors at translation.

The cat is the source of a continuous production of interpretive books;
the truth is that there is nothing to interpret, only a phenomenology in
relation to other mammals, within a field of trans-species communication.
It is the wavering position of the animal, its flux or fluid mechanics
near the point of turbulence, that breaks through the surface of classical
logic and negation (not-x = y, not-y = x), instead tending towards fuzzy
and dissipative negations, loopings without return, the sheffer stroke
dual of neither x nor y. (I've written at length on this in other
contexts.)  In short, the cat (in relation as well to transitional
objects) cannot be classified, classically-described, through no fault or
characteristic of its own - instead, it is our cultural field that fails
to accommodate what we perceive as murkiness, in relationship to what we
also tacitly accept as our own clarity and rationality.

Five sentences by Pres. G.W.B., as quoted by Lewis H. Lapham
in "Shock and Awe" in *Harper's Magazine* May 2003.

1. "The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world,
it is God's gift to humanity."

2. "We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we
can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind
all of life, and all of history."

3. "Events aren't moved by blind change and chance . . . [but] by
the hand of a just and faithful God."

4. "The crew of the shuttle *Columbia* did not return safely to
earth. Yet we can pray that all are safely home."

5. "We will export death and violence to the four corners of the
earth in defense of our great nation."

If you want a leftist candidate who has a chance of winning try running one
and voting for her/him in the Democratic primaries. More than schoolboard
elections it was the organizing of conservative church groups to vote in
Republican primaries that pushed the party so far to the right. That's the
way the system works under a winner-take-all constitution as opposed to a
parliamentary government. It would be nice if there were an alternative,
but there isn't.

The first and last third party to take power in the US was the Republicans
in 1860. That was a consequence of the total disintegration of the existing
political system, and it didn't establish third-party politics, it simply
replaced one of the other parties.

Subject:      fwd - Greenboathouse News...

Greenboathouse Books is pleased to announce the release of our first title
for 2003:

*The Eye-Shift of Surface*
by Meredith Quartermain.

An astonishingly new collection of prose poems by Vancouver poet Meredith
Quartermain, Eye-Shift of Surface explores the permutations of the word "I"
(its abbreviations, roots, utterance and grammar) and its intimate
connection with the word "eye."

Here are the vocabularies of "I" including ways in which the letter is used
as more than linguistic container of self. Anti-confessional in tone these
playful associations challenge the transparent notion that "I" sees
everything.

Printed on acid-free 80lb Pastelle Text and wrapped in Fabriano Ingres
flyleaves
with 70lb Genesis Birch jacket; hand-stitched with French flaps.
This edition is limited to 52 numbered copies, all signed by the author.

    ISBN 1-894744-12-8
    Available now!
    $15.00

*

For more on Meredith's work, check out our second Exact Change dialogue
between Meredith Quartermin and Greenboathouse editor, Aaron Peck, now
on-site.

*

The first instalment of our Variant project is also up, with new poems by
Andy Weaver, Faro Sullivan, rob mclennan, Bonnie Nish and Brenda Schmidt.

Variant:
A new Greenboathouse initiative, Variant invites writers to respond in
poetic, lyric or narrative form to a "trigger"; a passage from a book, poem,
theoretical text (or billboard for that matter) will be posted on-line to
which writers are invited to respond in whatever direction they're drawn.

looking to the future election now, there does appear to be one very
solid democrat, a man dedicated to his ideas about what is best for
the people of this country and the people throughout the world that
this country touches...Howard Dean

http://www.deanforamerica.com/

i'm about as excited about Dean as i was Nader.  i'm even going to
re-register as a democrat in order to vote in the primaries.
i'm scaring myself out here man!  i SWORE i'd never go near
another democrat!  oh well, guess i'll just have to look in
the mirror and SCREAM before going to the polls.

anyone out there have any dirt i should know about on Dean?
anyone out there have any thoughts on any of the democrats
who are lining up for the next election?

more later,
CAConrad

Voting is a political, not a religious, act, and by its nature requires
compromise. Or so it seems to me.

check out http://www.greenboathouse.com/variant.htm to see the next
project for Victoria BC's Greenboathouse books "variant" series, run
by Jason Dewinetz & Aaron Peck.

their current trigger is:       "Sometimes a journey makes
                                    itself necessary."
                                                - Anne Carson,
                                                  Autobiography of Red
*

A new Greenboathouse initiative, Variant invites writers to respond in
poetic, lyric or narrative form to a "trigger"; a passage from a book,
poem, theoretical text (or billboard for that matter) will be posted
on-line to which writers are invited to respond in whatever direction
they're drawn.

We're looking for innovative and unconventional responses to these quotes,
and encourage contributors to develop their submissions as directly or
indirectly as they choose.

Submission Deadline:
June 30, 2003

Submission Guidelines:

Submissions to the Variant project can be of any genre, and we hope to get
a wide variety of styles and approaches.

The idea is simply to explore the theme provided as directly or indirectly
as you see fit. Take it in any direction it leads you, explore the
possibilities, then package your submisssion up inside the body of a
regular email and ship it off to us at variant@greenboathouse.com

From the Variants submitted we'll post somewhere around 5 pieces on-line.
The author of one of these will receive copies of the latest
Greenboathouse chapbooks and this piece will also be published as a
numbered and signed broadsheet with 10% of the print run going to the
author.

We also see this project as an invitation to reading and hope that
participants will not only submit their work but also send us passages
from their own readings, which may be used as future quotes to spur more
Variant writing by others.

religion is a non-stop political disco.
politics on the other hand aid or jepordize millions
of human bodies all over this planet every day.
no compromise.
Americans MUST not compromise EVER AGAIN!
our consumption puts the world in danger
every single moment of the day someone
somewhere is in danger because of our
filthy political compromises.

I'm as outraged as anyone else over our world-wide political stupidities,
but this kind of naive bullshit is tiresome and useless.  The sentence
below is meaningless because "Americans" do not all agree with one
another.

Getting rid of the Electoral College might be a help,
though doing so could cut both ways. Nowadays,
doing so might bring urban voters up to the clout
level of rural voters.

Who's next for global vigilante?

GWYNNE DYER
Apr. 11, 2003

A reader's letter published in the Los Angeles Times last week said it all:
"We have learned two things from the war in Iraq. We have learned that the
Tigris flows through Baghdad, and the Hubris flows through the White House."

Hubris -- the belief that you are so clever and so powerful that you can get
away with anything -- is certainly the prevailing state of mind in
Washington this week as the Iraqi regime collapses before the U.S.
onslaught. So where is the next war?

There was never any doubt that the United States would win this war: The
U.S. defence budget last year was 250 times bigger than Iraq's.

But the next phase of the drama is already taking shape offstage and is
likely to be more painful and difficult for the United States than simply
smashing up a Third World army.

In the north of Iraq, the Kurds want to control the mainly Kurdish cities of
Mosul and Kirkuk because the surrounding oil fields would place an
independent Kurdish state on a sound economic footing. Kurdish fighters have
already seized Kirkuk -- but Turkey, anxious about the influence of an
independent Kurdistan on their own huge and restive Kurdish minority, have
said that if the Kurds take Mosul and Kirkuk, they invade.

The United States is trying to limit the damage, promising that the Kurdish
fighters will be replaced by "coalition" troops in Kirkuk and inviting
Turkish army observers to the city. But it won't find it easy to get the
Kurds out.

This is their best chance for independence in the past 80 years, and they
would be mad not to try for it. They have been betrayed by the U.S. so many
times that they feel they owe it nothing, and they say they would resist a
Turkish invasion whether the U.S. helps them or not.

The situation down south is even more precarious, for the long-oppressed
Shia Arabs of the south are about two-thirds of the entire Iraqi population.

If Iraq really became a democracy, the Shiites would dominate the
government, and naturally turn to their fellow Shiites in Iran for advice
and support.

Since Iran is allegedly part of the "axis of evil," the retired U.S.
generals who will shortly be ruling Iraq are unlikely to turn the country
over to people with that sort of friends. If U.S. troops stay in Iraq and
the Shiites feel cheated out of their fair share of power yet again,
however, it won't be long before they start resisting U.S. rule.

It gets worse. Any Shia resistance movement in Iraq is bound to get support
from Iran, and there will soon be U.S. troops all along the Iran-Iraq
border, only a few hours' drive from Iran's main oil fields.

Even if the Bush administration isn't planning another war before the next
election, U.S. attempts to stop infiltration across the border from Iran
could easily lead to a U.S.-Iran war much sooner than that -- and Iran has a
relatively united population three times bigger than Iraq's.

Above all, there is the fact that the United States, abetted by Britain and
Australia, has launched an unprovoked attack on a sovereign state.

That is why most other governments are deeply worried: The American attack
on Iraq could be used as a precedent, using exactly the same arguments as
President George Bush, to justify an Indian attack on Pakistan or a North
Korean attack on South Korea. The U.S. action in Iraq has fundamentally
challenged the rule of law in the world, which is a problem no matter how
happy most Iraqis are at the moment -- and Washington clearly meant to do
just that.

Consider the remarks of former CIA chief James Woolsey, a Bush
administration insider who was recently mentioned in a leaked Pentagon
document as one of the possible administrators of post-war Iraq.

Last week in Los Angeles, Woolsey described the war in Iraq as the start of
the fourth world war (the Cold War being the third), and warned his audience
that, "This fourth world war, I think, will last considerably longer than
either the first or aecond world wars did for us."

The real enemies this time, he explained, were the religious rulers of Iran,
the "fascists" of Iraq and Syria, and the Islamic extremists of Al Qaeda. He
made no distinctions between them (though in real life they have very little
in common), and he promised a long crusade against them.

There was no suggestion the U.S. would bother to get legal authority from
the United Nations before attacking the sovereign states on his list.

"As we move towards a new Middle East over the years and the decades to
come," he said, "we will make a lot of people very nervous. Our response
should be, 'Good! We want you nervous. We want you to realize now, for the
fourth time in a hundred years, this country and its allies are on the
march'."

Eventually, the American public is likely to rebel against the continual
flow of casualties and the higher taxes that come with this new role of
global vigilante, but in the meantime it is going to be a wild ride.

How weird to see the cover of the NY Times Book Review!

Cassius Marcellus Coolidge, 1844-1934, lived in Antwerp, NY, and worked as
a druggist and sign painter, even founded a bank and a newspaper. Then he
moved to Rochester and started painting his dog pictures (not just poker,
but playing baseball, riding trains, more). Cigar companies made prints of
them to use as publicity, and Coolidge turned out copies for
advertisements, calendars, and prints -- and they're still popular, just by
the measure of the amount of places you can buy them listed on Google.
Kitsch surrealism pop, something weird and amusing, about these paintings,
and they gave comfort to many working and middle class families. Now, I
would like to find his letters, his papers, his archive, and get to the
source of his inspiration, the core of his doggy heart. Is there a poetry
equivalent?  Would I feel better if Bush's cabinet were replaced entirely
with dogs?

I don't find it strange that academics want to talk about "subjectivity" when discussing Ashbery.  They need to invoke such categories in order to be taken seriously within a profession that has little interest in poetry as such.  What would be strange would be if an academic wrote a book about Ashbery and _didn't_ mention "subjectivity."

I think one could go further, and claim that most academics are only able to write about poems that seem to fit pre-existing professional categories.  That's why Susan Howe is so often written about in learned journals, and Robert Pinsky is not.  So long as "subjectivity" or the "material signifier" or "women writers" are dominant categories within the profession, Howe will attract many commentators; should "democracy" or the "city" (sorry, "urban spatiality") become dominant, the academics will begin publishing on Pinsky.

But I don't think that most readers of Howe, Pinsky, and Ashbery conceptualize the poetry in this way.  Their abstractions are likely to be more commonplace: for them, the poetry is about happiness, regret, fear, etc.  And, indeed, fear and regret matter to most of us; "subjectivity" does not.  An academic critic might be able to have insights that would interest most readers, but he or she would not be able to articulate them in the authoritative tones of the professional.  There would be no footnotes, no theorists to cite (at least no recent theorists).  There would be no means of answering an interview committee when they ask what "your work is about."

I've just re-read "The System," Ashbery's long Wordsworthian meditation on, among other things, the changing seasons and the nature of human happiness.  I don't recall the word "subjectivity" coming into my thoughts once, and I can't imagine he would use the term either.  Nor, when I try to think like a professionally accredited young scholar, can I call to mind a period of literary history in which "subjectivity" hasn't seemed "complicated."  So what does that say about the usefulness of the category?

Heah, the barking - even when they sleep - is loud enough already.
But with muzzles around their chops, that might work.
I am afraid, however, metaphors here only evade the real. But humor is good.
Hilton as a dog playing poker with Ron as a dog in Rochester with a bunch of

Subjectivity is not the opposite of objectivity. Without the subject there
is no object, without the object there is no subject. So why address it? "O
a lot / Blooms, get squashed on the tongue: / Where are you going? Why do
you think you are? / Crushed leaves, berries, the stars / Continually
falling, / streaking the sky: / Can it be a climate? No, it is old and /
Sometimes the agog spectator wrenches a cry / From his own house. He thought
he heard."
John Ashbery. From, "But Not That One."

Joel W.

when discussing Ashbery.  They need to invoke such categories in order to be

such.  What would be strange would be if an academic wrote a book about
Ashbery and _didn't_ mention "subjectivity."
>
> I think one could go further, and claim that most academics are only able

That's why Susan Howe is so often written about in learned journals, and
Robert Pinsky is not.  So long as "subjectivity" or the "material signifier"
or "women writers" are dominant categories within the profession, Howe will
attract many commentators; should "democracy" or the "city" (sorry, "urban
spatiality") become dominant, the academics will begin publishing on Pinsky.
>
> But I don't think that most readers of Howe, Pinsky, and Ashbery
conceptualize the poetry in this way.  Their abstractions are likely to be
more commonplace: for them, the poetry is about happiness, regret, fear,
etc.  And, indeed, fear and regret matter to most of us; "subjectivity" does
not.  An academic critic might be able to have insights that would interest
most readers, but he or she would not be able to articulate them in the
authoritative tones of the professional.  There would be no footnotes, no
theorists to cite (at least no recent theorists).  There would be no means
of answering an interview committee when they ask what "your work is about."
>

on, among other things, the changing seasons and the nature of human

think like a professionally accredited young scholar, can I call to mind a
period of literary history in which "subjectivity" hasn't seemed
"complicated."  So what does that say about the usefulness of the category?

I don't really have time-- no offence to anyone-- to get involved in what
Joe memorably calls elsewhere in his post the "shitstorm" of back & forth on
this, but I do want to throw in a few thoughts.  The need to build a
coalition of resistance to the very effective political strategies of the
right is ~exactly~ what's necessary at a time like this, & exactly what the
left has been unable to pull off.  Our inability to do that, plus the
apparent ease with which the left has been coopted (by Dem politicians,
e.g.) is one of the things that has allowed the political discourse in the
U.S. to be steadily shifted to the right in the years since Reagan was first
elected.  Part of the problem is our disunity (which can also be put in a
positive way: our diversity-- & this IS also a strength).  Another problem
is our lack of coherent tactics.  There ARE things about which we should not
compromise, but to never compromise is a great way to be unable to build
consensus, to be unable to negotiate past obstacles, & ultimately to be
unable to to work with anyone but the highly like-minded.  This would be a
fine strategy if people who thought as we do about politics (at least)
numbered something like 70 to 80 percent.  In the present circumstances, it
is self-defeating.

One thing that has always struck me about the right-wing Republicans is
that, like them or not (& let me be very clear that I loathe them), they
have great party discipline.  They work very hard (including, I'm sure, a
lot of arm twisting & coercion & backroom tactics which I disapprove of) to
get senators & representatives, etc., to support their program.  They're a
political machine, & working at their most efficient (the current
administration, & Reagan's first one) they can ram a lot of ambitious (read:
scary) legislation through.  The Democrats haven't been as effective in
getting their programs through, much less in opposing the other side's,
really, since LBJ's Great Society, & before that, Roosevelt.  I think that
until a left or left-liberal party builds that degree of discipline &
effectiveness, then we are going to be unable to turn back much of what
Reagan & Shrub have done.

Which is to say, it comes down to grassroots organizing (which I certainly
am not doing at present, I'll admit).  It also comes down to realizing that
we have to work together, make what alliances we can, & recognize that we
may not easily achieve all of what we want, but with effort & common sense
we can achieve some victories against our real enemies.  & Let's be clear:
wealthy born-again christian zealots who want to wage wars of imperialism
while rolling back civil rights at home are our ENEMIES.  We need to do what
we can, & think clearly about what we are doing, be persistent, & be very
focused on our ultimate aims, or else some day there may not be much
democracy left to fight for.  And that, friends, is what really scares me.

Preachin' to the choir, s'cuse me....

Why would Leftists have anything to do with the Democratic party? Are
you saying that the Democrats are leftists? Am I missing something?
Maybe that is a US usage that we Canadians dont understand.

Adding -ivity to the ends of words seems to be the latest academic fad right
now: Subjectivity, performativity, etc. Less trite than the usual -ism, I
guess, but no less suitably stuffy and obfuscational. It's only a matter of
time before we see:

Phallotivity
Vaginativity
Barakativity
Canadativity


Make up your own!

I was standing in the feedback of hours, untouched by
any of the changes coursing through your skin, with
all the white falsity of digital networking caching
dead musics in my face. I was thinking kinship levels
of everything overslept; the birds hadn't gotten up
yet, the sun in her wraparound sunglasses and
tanningBooth smile still had to lend her cool sweet
body to the banks of sky's rhetoric suffused with
surgery; the hands moved within me, plucking from my
veins these intrinsic equations: mind: time shadows;
the slopes of tone. I was messing myself up with her
downsizing in those slick tunnels of usage. When I
woke that day, still coping with fatal latitudes, the
trees and their anatomies had separated for good.




Her voice notches birdsong to delicious flute. Lulls
in use have tamped all cursive stalks into noisy dirt.
Earnings hoisted , soon blond stir panned fruit until
full. Tools numbed by broods of tasks curl genre
around toys on alert.





As dumb luck would have it,  trees are budding beyond
her control in the segment before sleep, as I dream
rows of alphabets frosted with silk. Am I awake, or do
all these hours shiver to pin-size, soliloquoy? True,
you do seem saddened by them, or is it the injection
you fear, slipshod membrane scored with razor snoring
but staring white-eyed at the ceiling of her dreams
until the canon wears off? I weather night thinly,
like a copse of braille.

poetry festival in New York, The People's Poetry Gathering: it was a theme,=

it, quite rightly, it a "crime against culture." Adding insult to injury=20
are the unbelievably callous remarks of Donald Rumsfeld, quoted by Steve --=
=20
I say unbelievably even though my threshold for what I believe the Bush=20
regime will say is constantly being reset to the south side of decency, in=

the direction of, indeed, crimes against culture. A friend at the=20
proceedings mentioned to me that she planned to do a performance in which=20
she stamped on the American flag. But I would say otherwise: Donald=20
Rumsfeld and George Bush are the ones trampling the flag. If we condemn=20
this totally predictable and preventable, can we say with some literal=20
accuracy barbaric?, act, which occurred as a direct result of U.S.=20
government actions and policy, we condemn it, also, in the spirit of an=20

This is the report from the today's Chronicle of Higher Education:

Looting of Antiquities in Iraq Outrages Scholars

By DANIEL DEL CASTILLO

The looting and destruction of priceless artifacts in Iraq's premier museum=
=20
over the weekend outraged scholars worldwide. They said that the loss or=20
damage of tens of thousands of objects in the National Museum of Iraq could=
=20
forever hurt the understanding of Babylonian, Sumerian, and Assyrian=20
civilizations.

Many of the museum's staff members wept upon seeing the devastation. Nabhal=
=20
Amin, the deputy director, told reporters, "They have looted or destroyed=20
170,000 items of antiquity dating back thousands of years. ... They were=20
worth billions of dollars."

Ms. Amin and other scholars blamed the U.S. military for not protecting the=
=20
museum.

"It was completely avoidable," said McGuire Gibson, one of the world's=20
leading scholars on Mesopotamia and a professor at the University of=20
Chicago's Oriental Institute. "I thought I had gotten assurances that the=20
building would be safeguarded. I have been talking to the military since=20
January 24th, and we supplied them with a list of more than 5,000=20
archaeological sites, which they've been putting on their maps. They know=20
where those locations are."

A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense declined to comment on=20
Sunday on how individual sites would be protected. "The mission of the=20
forces has not changed over all since this operation began," the spokesman=
=20
said. "Where those locations that are safe and secure to conduct noncombat=
=20
operations exist, we are making the transition. But I can't talk to any=20
specific location -- it's impossible to know the situation on the ground=20
except for the commanders that are there, who have to make that call."

The loss at the National Museum was particularly devastating since it=20
contained not only its own collections but artifacts from smaller museums=20
around the country in a deliberate effort to centralize and protect the=20
objects from the onslaught of war.

"It's nothing short of a total disaster. It's certainly the worst thing=20
that has ever happened to a museum in the Middle East," said Eckhart Frahm,=
=20
a professor of Assyriology at Yale University. Mr. Frahm, who has worked in=
=20
Iraq, said the losses for scholarship were incalculable, especially given=20
that tens of thousands of cuneiform tablets were stolen or destroyed before=
=20
they had been cataloged or deciphered.

"It wasn't just what was in the showcases, but everything in the basement,=
=20
very little of which had been published or properly examined," he said.

A livid Mr. Gibson, who has spent 34 years working in Iraq and heads the=20
American Association for Research in Baghdad, was frustrated and perplexed=
=20
at how a tragedy of such a cultural magnitude could unfold, especially when=
=20
other archaeological sites have been relatively protected.

"It's the equivalent of if the U.S. Army had been sitting outside the Cairo=
=20
Museum and let it be looted by a mob, or if they had been in Athens and let=
=20
a mob loot the Athens Archaeological Museum," he said.

In an effort to focus international attention on the crisis, a group of=20
scholars of Mesopotamia and the Near East has written a petition to the=20
United Nations, urging measures for the safeguarding of Iraqi cultural=20
heritage now and after the war. The petition, which had more than 260=20
signatures as of Sunday night, is scheduled to be presented to the United=20
Nations today.

"'Mesopotamia' designates the land where human beings first built cities,=20
organized complex states, formulated elaborate religious beliefs, invented=
=20
writing, developed sophisticated visual and literary expression,=20
articulated measures for maintaining law and justice," the petition reads.=
=20
"Destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage will result in devastating and=20
irrecoverable losses to human civilization, and to participate in or allow=
=20
such destruction may inflame resentment and anger throughout the world,=20
particularly in the Middle East. We believe, as is also recognized by the=20
people and government of Iraq, that the ancient cultural heritage of the=20
Iraqi people is at least as vital to their future as oil reserves are to=20
their country's economic survival."

Ko=EFchiro Matsuura, the director general of the United Nations Educational,=
=20
Scientific and Cultural Organization, or Unesco, issued a rare emergency=20
statement on Saturday emphasizing "the urgent need to preserve collections=
=20
and a heritage considered to be one of the richest in the world."

Mr. Matsuura contacted the American and British authorities in Iraq and=20
urged them to take immediate measures to assure military protection for the=
=20
National Museum in Baghdad and another important museum in the northern=20
city of Mosul, as well as other Iraqi cultural institutions and=20
archaeological sites.

Unesco has also alerted Interpol and countries bordering Iraq, requesting=20
that they respect and enforce the 1970 Unesco Convention prohibiting the=20
illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property. Mr.=
=20
Matsuura has called upon a variety of cultural, academic, and commercial=20
institutions to join forces with Unesco "in a comprehensive mobilization so=
=20
that stolen objects should not find their way to acquirers."

Outside of Baghdad, other collections important to scholars have also been=
=20
damaged. The University of Mosul last week had its rare-books collection=20
stolen, along with hundreds of ancient Arabic manuscripts, as the city fell=
=20
into chaos. To no avail, clerics used the loudspeakers of the city's=20
mosques, urging looters to respect the religious and cultural heritage of=20
the documents.

The disappearance of Sumerian-Babylonian artefacts
already started in the '90s, under Hussein's rule (not
that that in any way lessens the enormity of this loss
[and not that any of this lessens the uncomfortable
situation of mourning the disappearance of objects at
a time when loss of life, casualties, would seem to
mean so much more]):

http://iraqaction.org/oldsite/babylon.html

http://www.newint.org/issue316/rivers.htm

The Babylon Museum was filled with empty cases even
before April changed everything.  It's
reported/claimed that Hussein moved artefacts into
safekeeping to protect them from air raids,... but
that was understood to mean they had been permanently
moved into underground circulation.  Other monuments
(the winged bull in the above article) were mutilated
with chainsaws in an attempt to transport them away;
archaeological sites were showing up empty.

(Meanwhile, the Iraqi government had been appealing to
Berlin for the return of the Ishtar Gate, removed
during European imperalist campaigns.)


I studied cuneiform for about two or three years.
(The process of studying cuneiform is remarkably like
Armand Schwerner's ~The Tablets,~ which is much more
faithful to the internal experience of
studying/reading cuneiform than anyone would possibly
imagine from Schwerner's slapstick: the strains
cuneiform places upon the memory require florid
mnemonic devices of, all my fellow students reported
to me, extremely personal and idiosyncratic
connections and inventions: pet's names, relatives...
all mixed in with ancient Babylonia.)

The irony of cuneiform "literature" is that it's
extremely dry and consists almost entirely of receipts
and financial accounting.  Rarities like Gilgamesh are
embraced so fervently by Westerners because they're
one of the few instances of a picaresque, colorful
narrative along Occidental sensibilities.

There are millions, probably tens of millions, of
cuneiform documents, meticulously recording debts,
loans, and payments, mainly.  Their abundance, and
their bureaucratese, makes them more than anyone knows
what to do with.  The vast majority of them are left
untranslated, simply because the thousands that ~have~
been translated have largely been passed over as
unutilizable (cuneiform translators are also, of
course, in diminishing numbers).

My studies centered around a "palaeo-economics"
project, plotting the price fluctuations in six
commodities over a 600 year period . . . barley, cress
. . . wool . . . darn, I can't remember the
commodities any more (a friend who'd invited over for
dinner once tried to put together a meal out of the
food involved!).  Unfortunately for me, a Ph.D. up at
Yale was awarded her dissertation just as we were put
in touch with each other, our research completely
duplicating each other's.  Her name is Alice and, as
far as we knew, there was only one other person, in
Hungary, who was involved with the same material.  (It
was all just waiting to happen and, in a sense,
latently self-evident: the 800-page tome of Abraham
Sachs' edition of the Babylonian Astronomers' Diaries
gave the price changes on a monthly basis for those
years, [along with the rise and the fall of the river
level] so, sort of, it was "simply" a matter of
collating the data.)

Financial records were so extensive and detailed that
my teacher, a Sumerologist, was able to reconstruct,
street by street, house by house, family by family,
the interrelationships of residents in one
city/village in Ur, based on who owed whom how much
money when.


(There's a theory of Denise Schmandt-Besserat's,
incidentally, which is quite persuasive although hotly
contested [Schmandt-Besserat's academic credentials
weren't entirely ~pro forma~], that writing and
cuneiform pictographs originated out of ~counting~ and
numbers, rather than out of language.  The Middle East
is scattered with these odd little Hershey's
Kiss-shaped blobs [the forms vary, actually], billions
of them, of previously unknown purpose.
Schmandt-Besserat established a time line and
genealogy that traced the most archaic cuneiforms
pictographs out of the blob tokens.  [The tokens look
like Yves Tanguy shapes.]  The radicalism of that
possibility is a sort of ~de facto~ grammatology,
where writing would, at least in origin, indeed no
longer be a pale echo of speech.)


Cuneiform is interesting, though, in a "The Subject
Does Not Exist" sort of way: it chronicles a time
~before~ the subject showed any inklings of ever
~beginning~ to exist.  I recall, specifically, the
surprise when, in a particular dynastic history of the
reign of such-and-such a king, out of nowhere the
prose veers and it says something like "And he sat on
a rock..."!  That shift to a more descriptive,
personified concept of person represented a paradigm
shift in depiction.

. . . Similarly, talking about it reminds me, there
were startling moments in the Babylonian Astronomers'
Diaries, which otherwise read like almanacs, where "A
dog appeared inside the city gates" . . .  When Alice
and I first spoke, reminiscing about those few,
bizarre alphabestiary cameo appearances was
heart-warming. ("And remember when the locusts...!")


I'll see if I can't pull some of my pages, graphs and
records from those days together to scan 'n' show.

(Actually, once I learned that Alice had scooped the
commodity information and there was no point in going
further with it [everything except a prose elucidation
was completed, regardless], I went back and plotted
the ~rainfall~ and weather for that same, 600-year
period.  Those graphs I haven't shown anyone yet.)

Subject:      in Middle Class Land
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Out here in Middle Class Land, an aunt and uncle come over to visit.  My
brother and I are watching the conclusion of the Master's Tournament.  My
father has just let my aunt (mother's sister) and uncle in and then gone to
the kitchen, where they will have coffee, cake, etc.

The uncle, nice enough man, makes his usual feeble attempts at social
contact.  He shares his latest "office email Iraq War jokes":
"Why do Iraqi pilots cost less to train?"  "Because they don't have to learn
to land." Etcetera Etcetera Etcetera

My brother, a stock broker and country club golfer, does his best to
politely smile (accept the uncle's feeble attempt at social contact) but not
"reinforce" and encourage the uncle to go on and on.  Yes, he's a stock
broker, but that in no way means he's a redneck or a Republican; he's not,
period.  In fact, his clients have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on
the Bush Administration stock market, and No, my brother is not even
remotely fond of the pillaging or the pillagers.

I take a slightly more direct and "aggressive" tact.  I know that my uncle
is simply an average Joe, a regular upstate New York, Catholic, TV watching,
family "man" who would be telling jokes from the Anti-Bush side if he were
only intelligent and sophisticated enough to imagine that neither my brother
nor I sympathize with his stupid, pedestrian "humour."  When next he starts
"defending" Hootie Johnson and the legal "right" for the Augusta "National"
Golf Course to restrict their membership to women, I know darn well that
here again, Uncle Middle Class has again incorrectly assumed that my brother
and I are all for the Augusta Neanderthal's rejection of Ms. Burke's efforts
to get women into Augusta as members.  I point out that, Yes, of course
Hootie and the old guard are "not legally obligated" to change their private
club's membership restrictions, but "it's coming, anyway--women will be in
the club within a few years (and rightfully so), so Johnson is just an
idiot-jerk."  End of discussion, essentially, without ruffling his feathers
or even hurting any feelings, and he merely gets a little more reality as to
broaching topics and views that will "impress" his nephews, something he's
tried to do in his same old same old tired, naive manner for 30 years.

After my uncle leaves the room and goes out to the kitchen to join my aunt
and my father and mother, my brother and I keep watching the little
post-tournament ceremony and we start cracking up with jokes about Hootie
Johnson, the racists and chauvinists of Augusta/Georgia, about Tiger Woods
(whom we "dislike" for his "arrogance" and his single-minded approach to
being the greatest golfer, though it makes him less a human).  We laugh at
Hootie Johnson especially, though, for right at this very moment he has a
black golfer (Tiger, the previous year's Master's champ) and a Canadian
golfer (Mike Weir, this years Master's winner, and a left-hander, too) in
the same "sacred, secret Master's Champ Room" at Augusta.  We joke that if
they let Tiger's mother in (she's female, obviously, and she's also Asian),
why then Hootie's head will probably blow up, etc.

What's my point? I don't know, exactly.  To some degree, I'm just sharing
some feelings and thoughts and experience.  I want to say, though, that this
is the same scenario throughout Middle Class Land (at my workplace, for
example, which is a manufacturing plant, or "factory," actually).  I firmly
believe that it's not just western or "upstate" New York, only.  This is
Middle Class Land all over the country.

Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies - 10

[I write these "meditations" from time to time in an attempt to stay
sane. If you find them tedious, apply the magic of "delete." If you want
to share them with others, feel free to do so.]


April 13, 2003

"Stuff happens," Donald Rumsfeld explains.

Artifacts from thousands of years of civilization smashed and stolen:
"Stuff happens."  How many urns and statues will circulate through the vast
antiquities black market and end up in the vaults of London bankers and
Texas oilmen?

The crowds cheer as the statue of the dictator, another artifact, is pulled
to the ground.  An aerial photo shows that the square is surrounded by
tanks with the crowd barely filling a tenth of it.  These are the
multitudes of Iraqis cheering their liberation.  Most Iraqis are cowering
at home.

Man-on-the-street TV interview with a Baghdad grocer: "We are happy.  We
want freedom from Saddam, yes?  And we want freedom from America.  You
understand?  Both."

Even before Baghdad fell, even before the blood stopped flowing, Syria
became the next target.

North Korea made an important concession: to open talks about their nuclear
program in any format (instead of the bilateral talks with the US they had
demanded).  But, as one expert on Korea comments in The New York Times
(April 13, 2003), "the problem is that, given the mood of the moment, can
the Bush administration take yes for an answer?"

Weapons of mass destruction have yet to be found.  No matter.  The Bush
gang falls upon its crudest, most opportunist rhetorical device: it appeals
to Americans' sense of justice and fair-play, that we are liberating a
people, and that we are acting in the interests of freedom.

My 85-year-old aunt who survived the Nazi murders through her wits and
sheer luck knows something about war.  We have many differences of opinion,
but we share a deep revulsion, and she too is suspicious of the great
arrogance of America.  She is sure disaster awaits America, and then "They
will blame the Jews."

My aunt's paranoia is borne of years of experience, since the Nazis and
other anti-Semites did blame everything on the Jews, from socialism to
socialites.  But she may be on to something in this case too: there is such
a complete identification between the US and Israel, even the same
personnel  Wolfowitz, Perle, and about two dozen other high-placed Jewish
advisors who have promoted the neo-con Likudnik line.  The reactionary
evangelists also promote the same line, but it'll be the Jews who will get
the shaft.

Congressman Moran, on the eve of the war, argued that the US was being
pushed to war by the Jews  an excessive comment, since American Jews were
no different in their opinions than the rest of the country, and if
anything they tilted against the war.  But his remark was accurate in the
sense that these ultra-Zionist demagogues are in the driver's seat.  The
distinctions between the US and Israel are smaller and smaller, the
distinctions between Jews as Jews and Zionist ideologues are growing more
confused day by day.

Once upon a time we Jews fought against the Roman Empire  now we ARE the
Roman Empire.

Jessica Lynch, a wounded POW, is rescued by soldiers, a daring
operation.  She is from Palestine, West Virginia.  Her good buddy, a Hopi
Indian, is killed.  Ironies and absurdities abound in images that violently
crisscross history: the women warriors, the settler and the Indian, the
echoes of Biblical obsession.

A former CIA director gleefully declares that this is the beginning of
World War IV (it turns out that World War III was the Cold War, but the
fact that we did actually avoid nuclear catastrophe deludes us into
thinking that it wasn't a war).

The TV has become so completely subservient, has become such an overt
propaganda operation, that I can barely watch anymore.  I flip on the news
channels, pick up the latest ejaculation, and turn to Comedy Central.  But
even there, stand-up comics entertain the troops.

Demonstrators for peace at the docks in Oakland are shot at with rubber
bullets and other "non-lethal" weapons.  Longshoremen standing by the sides
are also shot and arrested.  After the lockout, was there a reason to
target the ILWU?

"Stuff happens": a few harsh examples of state coercion, just a few
arrests, just some sweeps of immigrants, some civilian "watchdog" groups
like "Campus Watch," just the weight of the media cheering, and perhaps
people will shut up, acquiesce, defend the American way of life.  The fact
of the matter is that the bulk of Americans, at least for the moment,
accept the slide into fascism.  Didn't the Germans?

I do not think that "Peace is Patriotic."  I am not a patriot of the New
Roman Empire.  Peace is a universal.  I do not defend the "American way of
life."  I believe freedom and democracy is a development of humanity and
not a special creature of the United States.  I do not believe that the
two-party system is the highest form of democracy.

I am a traitor.

I hereby declare that my brain is a weapon of mass destruction.  I await
the invasion.

'Ankle-deep in/twittering stunt codes/and moral pucker,'
has 'The Feels.' And unashamedly so, as he explains:
'If we cannot refer to what doesn't exist/then I'll stop
talking to you now.'"

From Zimbardo's (former president of the APA) recent speech which in part
addresses the Surgeon General's recommendations on national stress:
"War is one of the intense stressors  we are
dealing with as a nation. The mature, tough solution is not to look away
from the cause but to deal with the stressor at its origin. To me, that
means to look longer and deeper at this war machine, this prime time,
death-dealing video war game, contrived by the current administration in
the name of "national security."

One of the things that caught my interest here was that in this analysis
which is based in part on contemporary psychological research on
emotion-focused and solution-focused coping strategies
he felt the need to pair 'tough' with 'mature'.  As background here consider
that loosely and stereotypically speaking these strategies can be equated
with sex roles.  Also as background consider that while in general more
productive of solutions, solution-focused coping strategies can lead to
exacerbation of stress when no solution is in fact possible.

and Yannis Ritsos, March 21, 1968, "After the Defeat":

After the heavy losses that the Athenians suffered at Aegospotami,
     a little later,
after our final defeat, free talk is dead, so too the Periclean glory,
the flowering of Art, the Gymnasia and the Symposia of our learned
     men.  Now
deep silence and gloom in the Agora, and the Thirty Tyrants
     unaccountable.
Everything, even what is most ours, becomes ours by default, without
     the possibility of any appeal, any defense or vindication,
any formal protest even.  Our papers and books are burned,
our country's honor thrown out in the garbage.  And if we might ever
    be allowed
to bring an old friend as a witness, he would refuse to to come
     for fear of finding himself in our situation--and rightly so.
That's why it's really alright to be here: maybe we can establish a new
     relationship with nature,
gazing out, beyond the barbed wire, at a bit of sea, the stones,
     the grass,
or maybe a cloud at sunset, heavy, violet, touching.  And maybe
     someday we'll find a new Kimon, secretly guided
by the same eagle, to dig down and uncover the iron point
     of our spear,
rusted, that too eaten away, so that he can carry it officially through
     Athens
in a funeral procession or victory celebration, with music and wreaths.

Subject:      Third Factory
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I've been meaning to mention the following URL for some time

        http://www.thirdfactory.net

A little background, for those interested:

The site, Third Factory/Notes to Poetry, continues an experiment in
criticism that I began in e-mail format back in 1998/99 (now archived as a
.pdf document on Brian Kim Stefans's ARRAS site at
http://www.arras.net/pdfs.htm).

After a longish pause in 1999/2000 and the stormily collective debates
about market-driven poetics in early 2001, I began the transition from
email bulletins to a web format in the summer of 2001. Once the site was
constructed, I tended it off-line for about a year and a half, finally
loading it to a server provided by Jerrold Shiroma/Duration Press just this
past January. Since then it has been quietly logging about forty unique
visits a day--a steady handful of which originate, happily, from outside
the US.

Conceived as an attempt to document one reader's passage through the
teeming field of contemporary poetry, the site is articulated into several
components:

* daybooks - reading, listening to, and looking at contemporary poetry
* constellations - eleven titles that together conspire to look like "the
present" to me
* the lipstick of noise - columns, talks, articles
* notes to poetry - capsule reviews of recent publications
* links - to blogs, poetry sites, a few political resources
* works received - pub info for everything that comes into the house as
gift or purchase

There is also a page that pulls most of these elements together for easy
bookmarking and browsing (http://www.thirdfactory.net/ensemble.html).

Fan of blogs though I am (a current favorite: Stephanie Young's
"Well-Nourished Moon" on blogspot at http://stephanieyoung.blogspot.com/),
I don't update Third Factory frequently enough to have it qualify as a
blog. It's more in the nature of site to be glanced at every now and again:
which is what this e-mail invites you to do.

Hello everyone,

I'm going to be leading some writing workshops for women in prison over the
summer.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experience?  What
exercises/poems/poets/activities/etc. you've used and found
useful/stimulating?  General advice for working with poetry with the
incarcerated?  I've lead workshops for undergrads before and taught older
students before, but this will be pretty different I imagine.

Front channel, back channel, psychic channel.......

Thanks in advance.

i've heard it said that "most" or "many" Americans are stupid, and that's simply
not true.  some are more informed than others (for various reasons), and the more
aware everyone becomes--REALLY SEEING what it is our consumption of goods,
services and other resources is doing to the people of this planet, and to the
planet, the better choices we'll finally begin to make together.  Big Mouths
like me have our work to do, patiently studying the affects of alarm clocks,
sitting beside them eating or speaking different things until the giant alarm
is perfected for running into the streets with our poems or bull horns.

in Philadelphia there is a 92-year-old poet named Herschel Barron who about
lost his head to Joseph McCarthy when he was younger.  i ran into Herschel
a couple of weeks ago to hear him promise me that Homeland Security will
prove to be far more ominous than the witch-hunts he and others were
subjected to when he was his own kind of walking alarm clock.

i first met Herschel when i was a teenager, and i've never heard or seen
him so agitated about the political climate within our borders.  i DO RECALL
him giving a speech about ten years ago at a union rally, and saying that
if the bourgeois poets of his day had gotten off their asses and lent
him and others a hand that things might not have become so grim.

more and more i believe that Americans will involve themselves in the
reparations of labor and land if they can really GLIMPSE the daily
battlefield our consumption creates.  this is a country of AMAZING
people, millions and millions of amazing people who are good, and
want to do good by the world, but maybe they don't always get to
see how certain things they do in their lives affect the world.

in the article, he wonders why contemporary poetry sounds
so bland... if you've ever been to a poetry workshop,
you'll have had the experience of getting every departure

unless you resist the pressure of consensus, all the good

Ok, Craig, I see what you're getting at, and I'm sorry my previous email
was so impatient (chalk it up to a sour mix of the current political scene
and the sleep deprivation that comes with new parenthood).  My frustration
was coming out of the sense that the "No compromise!" position so often
seems to allow people *not* to undertake the kinds of communication and
persuasion you describe below.  Something like what Mark DuCharme
described in that good recent post where he describes the Left's (as
opposed to the Right's) failure to speak to the larger public in any
compelling way in recent years.

Anyway, I hear ya,
Steve

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Re: Tom Bell's post on the Subject of "Zimbardo on War and Peace," some of
which I copied in below:
"From Zimbardo's (former president of the APA) recent speech which in part
addresses the Surgeon General's recommendations on national stress: "War is
one of the intense stressors we are dealing with as a nation. The mature,
tough solution is not to look away from the cause but to deal with the
stressor at its origin. To me, that means to look longer and deeper at this
war machine, this prime time, death-dealing video war game, contrived by the
current administration in the name of 'national security.'
One of the things that caught my interest here was that in this analysis
which is based in part on contemporary psychological research on
emotion-focused and solution-focused coping strategies he felt the need to
pair 'tough' with 'mature'. As background here consider that loosely and
stereotypically speaking these strategies can be equated with sex roles.
Also as background consider that while in general more productive of
solutions, solution-focused coping strategies can lead to exacerbation of
stress when no solution is in fact possible."
I am reminded of undergraduate school class (25+ years go, and I recall
studying Zimbardo, too--Phillip?), "Group Process," for which Prof Borkk had
the class elect "a process" leader (to facilitate, and/or attend to,
emotional processes) and "a project" leader (to facilitate task
organization).  No, he wasn't trying to show us how splitting up leadership
into those two roles would make each work better, i.e., you can get more
done if you cut off the emotions?
I am reminded of undergraduate classes (also years ago) in Humanistic
Psychology with Prof November and many times getting the difference between
"doing" and "being" (Perls' Gestalt drew on Heidegger and we got plenty of
both in November classes).  I frequently understood that those into "doing"
(including my "over-achiever" self(serf?) at the time) were often cutting
off "the being" parts of themselves, parts that are considerably more
"reflective," "patient," "meditative," "still," in tune with greater depth
(and ambivalence and ambiguity) of emotions and range of emotion.
I am reminded of the distinctions between mental health and mental
not-health: the former observes and nourishes through life an increasing
capacity for experiencing "tolerance of ambivalence"; the latter shuns and
avoids ambivalence and remains rigidly resistant to this mind/body state
inside.  Hey, both of these are all of us, in varying degrees, on numerous
levels.
I am reminded of poets here in the Experimental venues and elsewhere in
Mainstream venues, all cherishing and revering "ambiguity," indeed generally
equating it with the term poetry altogether.
Back to Zimbardo, and Tom Bell's take: I have a strong hunch that "mature
and tough" refers to approaching problem solving with the immense and adult
courage it takes to look inside, maturely take responsibility for one's own
emotions (like, for example, I'm sure that Bush never looked deeply inside
and thought to himself, Geez, Clinton got that great economy and stuff
through his 8 years, and here I am in Robert Reich's aftermath, I'll bet
they planned it this way, the economy crapping out and balancing itself and
then I got this 9/11 thing, too, why have they been so damn hard on my Pappy
and me, why can't they just let me have a really cool presidency,
too--ooops, that's the C-student in me spoiled by Pappy's riches and
thinking I deserve everything without ever having to really work for it;
I'll show them, I'll start some wars, How dare they make me take a hard look
at my inadequacies and my father's imperfect fathering!).  The
neoconservatives and facists in general come from an entirely difference
emotional/psychological orientation.  They want to kill off "being" and
perfect "doing."  For them, "hard work" is never a matter of facing inner
demons, ambivalence, and ambiguity inside in order to better "understand"
what it means "to be," much less respecting "others"'conception of same.
For them, "hard work" is strictly external "action" that achieves goals,
especially political goals, that statistically perfect an apparently static
and entirely preplanned world, a product idealized in their minds and
American Enterprise Institute programs, etc.
I wonder, of course, if a lot of us must also exercise our so-called
advantage for accepting/understanding being, and for living with
ambiguity--but in ways we are not considering.  Are we being too intolerant
of our own more "forceful" abilities, not, smile, throwing maletov cocktails
at the Whitehouse, but, ummm, well, who knows what our greater ingenuity
could come up with.  (Personally, I'd love to be able to organize Buffett
(who says there will be a special place reserved in hell for Gary Winnick of
Global Crossing), George Soros (staunchly opposed to the war and Bush
actions), and Bill Gates, and a few others; together, a few of these parties
could bring Bush-egonomics down to its knees in a week or two via focused
and pinpointed "shorting" of the defense industries and the investment banks
that have stolen so much from retail investors.  I'm sure there is a fair
amount of money in Hollywood that would agree to collectively castrate the
neoconservatives' money machines as well.)
I don't know.  Just some thoughts here.

A Tyrant in Noose


Philo, Questions and Answers on Genesis, translated Marcus:

57. (Gen. xix. 37) Why did the elder (daughter) on bearing a son call him
Moab, proclaiming aloud what ought to have been concealed, (namely) "he is
from my father"?

The literal meaning is (an occasion of) exultation and glorification for
those who think rightly. For she did not cease (talking) and remain quiet
as if (it were) a reproach but prided herself in thought as if on a great
achievement, and with delight said, "I have a deserved honour, which the
father, who is the mind in me, sowed. And having been sown, he did not
disintegrate and pass away but having been born perfect, he was found
worthy of birth and nurture." And what should be the irreprehensible and
irreproachable progeny of the mind and counsel if not good and excellent
counsel. Wherefore (the child) who was born was a male.

Genesis xix. 36-37:

36 Thus the two daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
37 And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab; the same is the
father of Moab unto this day.

Now please note that "Moab" is m'av, from the father. Thus Moab carries
the name of the father in the son produced from an incestuous union. Of
course this has been repeatedly re/marked.

Therefore there is the father and the son whose sister is his mother; the
genes strangle and turn to salt. Now out of this union MOAB, the Mother Of
All Bombs, appears, the Mother who is the also the Son of the Father, in
order that the Father complete His work, which become the work of the Son.

Such is the work and the noose of the work that tightens on zero, on null,
on total annihilation, MOAB; thus the Absolute appears even within this
family circle, that of the tyrant itself.

Genesis xix. 30-35:

30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and abode in the mountain, and his two
daughters with him; for he feared to abide in Zoar: and he abode in a
cave, he and his two daughters.
31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there
is not a man in the earth to come unto us after the way of all of the
earth:
32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that
we may keep alive seed from our father.
33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn
came and lay with her father; and he knew now when she lay down, nor when
she arose.
34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the
younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink
wine this night also; and come thou, and lie with him, that we may keep
alive seed from out father.
35 And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger
arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when he lay down, nor when she
arose.

Rashi: ...whereas in reference to Moab it (Scripture) only forbade waging
war against them but permitted them (the Israelites) to vex them.

be careful when delving into the past, as poetry often does, for some
prisoners there is nothing back there they care to remember.

also to protect yourself be sure that they know you are only available to
them during the workshops, don't encourage them to send you stuff or keep
contact with you after the workshops. try not to get involved in the
personal dramas of their lives, clearly define your role as a literary
mentor so that they don't get too dependent on you personally.

but, apart from this, i have found such workshops can be fun and rewarding
for you and the incacerated.

a fellow called charles remington first introduced me to prison workshops
and he'd go in with a pocket full of lollies and a packet of cigarettes,
even though he didn't smoke himself, but i found my presence at workshops
was usually a treat in itself, they don't get much contact with people from
'the outside'.

POETRY IN MOTION

Author:    David Mehegan, Globe Staff Date: March 29, 2003 Page: E1 =
Section: Living / Arts

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Force of nature. There must be a more original =
descriptor for Katia Kapovich, Russian poet, but no milder one will do. =
With her flaming hair, ever-present cigarette, and intense voice =
punctuated with darting or sweeping gestures, she resembles some =
universal physical force, such as gravity or magnetism. By turns ironic, =
pensive, droll, and passionate in telling her life story in a low and =
lilting voice, this force is fueled by poetry.

Like other writers who came of age in the old Soviet Union, Kapovich =
battled crushing pressure to conform. In one 1980 melee in St. =
Petersburg, she slugged a cop while resisting arrest. She's been =
confined in a psychiatric hospital, harassed and ostracized, yet endured =
to become a known artist in her native country. Since she settled in =
Cambridge 11 years ago, life has been much quieter. Now 42, she is =
married to Russian poet and medievalist Philip Nikolayev, and they have =
a daughter, Sonia, 4 1/2. Kapovich and Nikolayev are editors of Fulcrum, =
a new literary review, and Kapovich works at Schoenhof's, the Cambridge =
foreign-language bookstore near Harvard Square.

Yet Kapovich's artistic life now has a different kind of excitement. In =
recent years, she has begun a metamorphosis into an American poet. She =
hasn't abandoned her native tongue - Kapovich has published four books =
of poetry in Russian. But English has given her a new voice.

The only child of Jewish parents in Kishinev, in southern Russia, =
Kapovich began writing poems when she was 7. Because of anti-Semitism - =
and because her father had antagonized Soviet authorities - Kapovich was =
barred from colleges in Kishinev, so in 1977 she enrolled in a college =
in Nizhnii Tagil, a gritty industrial town near the Ural Mountains =
surrounded by prison camps.

In her two years there, she studied literature, but the atmosphere was =
as grim as the surroundings: "I was beaten and ostracized. You had to =
subscribe to Izvestia and Pravda, but I objected - `I don't want these =
papers. I never read any Soviet paper.' "

Sick and depressed, she "escaped" to Kishinev and found another sort of =
trouble brewing. Her father, organizer of an architects collaborative to =
bypass the government and build rural housing, was imprisoned for crimes =
against the state. Kapovich's mother insisted her only daughter continue =
her studies, and Kapovich got into a Kishinev institute, studying world =
and Russian literature. There, she found a circle of like-minded young =
poets - a connection that became a lifeline.

The poets became part of an underground network, trundling clunky =
typewriters to other cities to find and secretly copy forbidden books - =
writings of Joseph Brodsky, Alexei Tsvetkov, Vladimir Nabokov.

"We met every day," Kapovich says. "We were on the phone, we would =
laugh, recite poems, and type them out."

Though the 1980s were the waning years of the Soviet Union, "the KGB =
made us famous," Kapovich says. "They would come to the university and =
say, `Beware of certain people who try to entice young intellectuals =
into their so-called literary movement.' They would give out our names =
and make us visible. People would immediately become interested in us. =
We were like forbidden fruit."

In August 1980, Kapovich's fiance, poet Eugene Horvat, frantically =
buried borrowed manuscripts in a Leningrad flower bed as she distracted =
a suspicious police officer. Another time, her typewriter and poems she =
carried were confiscated. Police later jailed the couple and their =
friends for issuing leaflets at Leningrad universities, demanding =
intellectual freedom. Despite her slender build, Kapovich fought back, =
and her glasses were smashed.

Thinking back, she dismisses the idea she was a hero or martyr: "I am =
actually not very brave. I was just obstreperous and hard to control. I =
wasn't afraid, because I was in love, and we were poets, and that is =
what mattered."

Ultimately, the young poets were returned to their hometowns for KGB =
interrogations. "My father was in prison, and they strongly recommended =
I undergo treatment in a madhouse," Kapovich says. "They said, `We know =
how close you are to your father, and you don't want anything to happen =
to him.' "

Her confinement lasted a few weeks at first, then she was discharged on =
a kind of probation, required to get a job and check in with the =
hospital from time to time. She was given counseling and medicated. =
"They found me very inadequate and manic-depressive because I would cry =
and say `I want to go right now,' and they would stop me and say `Don't =
you realize you need help?' " This continued intermittently for years, =
even as she worked during the day and studied at night. But she lost =
each job when she was caught writing poems.

Horvat's hometown, a suburb of Leningrad, had an especially brutal KGB =
office. Kapovich says her fiance openly admitted his activities to the =
agents. "I did it. These are my papers," she recalls him saying. Agents =
beat him, threatened to rape his sister, and forced him into exile in =
1981. Kapovich visited him in Berlin in 1989, but by then "he was mad," =
she says, sadly. Two years later, he killed himself. As she speaks, =
Kapovich takes a framed photograph of Horvat from the wall, gently =
placing it on the table.

"You had to get out of that world in order to see what was really =
there," Kapovich says. The state control was so pervasive that "they =
didn't need to kill thousands of people. A poet makes the evil visible. =
The way you breathe, the way you look at people is different, and they =
sense it. They would say, `We don't like the look on your face. You look =
like a foreigner.' "

In 1983, Kapovich received a master's degree in literature, with honors. =
She stayed in Kishinev for the next seven years but struggled to find =
teaching work, getting and losing menial jobs. She once smuggled =
sheepskins to make ends meet. She married a member of her circle, and =
when the Soviet Union fell apart in 1990, she moved to Israel with her =
husband and mother.

When her marriage dissolved, Kapovich moved to Cambridge in 1992, to =
marry another poet from her Kishinev group who lived in Boston, but that =
marriage didn't last, either. Philip Nikolayev, whom she had known in =
Russia, was a student at Harvard, and they eventually wed. She then =
enrolled in Boston College, receiving a degree in Russian literature in =
1995.

Though she had always loved poetry written in English - Dylan Thomas, =
Robert Frost - she wrote her first poem in English unexpectedly. "Paper =
Plane to Nowhere," written in 1997, was about the Kishinev psychiatric =
hospital, a subject that stymied her when writing in Russian.

"It was amazing," she says. "It was so simple, flowing through my mind, =
as if I were telling somebody, what [Osip] Mandelstam calls `the =
providential reader.' I was jumping up and down, like Pushkin jumped =
after finishing a poem, jumping for joy because I had tried to tell this =
story many times. But English made it possible."

Many of her English poems have appeared in literary journals and in a =
just-published anthology from Random House, though her manuscript of 55 =
poems, "Gogol in Rome," has yet to be published.

The importance of poetry in her life can't be exaggerated. "My =
[previous] husband was a nice guy," she says, "but I basically divorced =
him because of poetry. The last straw was when he said about my favorite =
poet, Timur Kibirov, `It's not even poetry.' I adore Kibirov. I said, =
`We cannot live together, you don't like Kibirov.' "

Last January, after a reading in Washington, the audience received =
copies of a poem, and a woman approached her - a poet from Kurdistan. =
"She said her husband was sick, and this poem could cure him," Kapovich =
recalls. "I looked in her eyes, because you can tell if a person is mad. =
It is a dream to write poetry in such a way that it can cure people."

Kapovich picked up the poem, signed her name, then added a Hebrew phrase =
from the Bible: "Talita ve kumi."

Very thoughtful response, Steve.  With your permission I'd like to pass this
to the psychology listserv where it arose?

I think Michal Helsem's note is relevant:
"in the article, he wonders why contemporary poetry sounds
so bland... if you've ever been to a poetry workshop,
you'll have had the experience of getting every departure
from TV-announcer-speak queried, with troubled frowns; &
unless you resist the pressure of consensus, all the good
stuff will be thrown out".

as is CAConrad on Herschel and "themselves in the
reparations of labor and land if they can really GLIMPSE the daily
battlefield our consumption creates.  this is a country of AMAZING
people, millions and millions of amazing people who are good, and
want to do good by the world, but maybe they don't always get to
see how certain things they do in their lives affect the world."

Good Day

People change in phenomenally small ways.  But the news changes =
instantly.  And it isn't obvious.  Today.  The televisions at work were =
showing some sort of bohnspiel and motor racing.  These are realities =
that I might have seen on the news:  I have a happy face pen that is =
black and yello; I am white; the sky is falling or else it is rain and =
then snow after the sun sets.  Doomed to always make sense, pistachio =
roses, logs, and strong coffee.  As well as those good grey days.  While =
it rains, the phone rang so close to Easter, news about a Toronto =
reading series filter through my only channels.

Good Day

Soulcrush.  Regime change.  These are our fits that were not always.  Of =

being in 2003.  Instead of on 2003.  To be tied.  Don't tread on me.  I =
have a crush on your soul.  Let's change regimes.  Check Yes or Not-no.  =
And I washed the light blue sheets again.  Tonight I'll switch them with =
the dark blue ones, but only if the rain stops.  And you'll never know.

Good Day

Shrapnel and azaleas hurtle over the radio, a commercial each for =
different products.  That it could happen, that it did.  Operation Iraqi =
Freedom means metal in the head and breast.  Shot through windows, =
explosions in the sky.  Rahed Hakem remembers "the voice of explosions" =
and saw from her door "the sky raining fire".  Bomblets.  Let's bomb.  =
In the name of freedom.  We can't say french.  Some remain unexploded =
right before the television screen in the living room.  Register your =
firearms.  I wonder if these little bombs have warning labels for =
children that say:  "if you can read this."  Cluster fuck.  What now.  =
What next?  That question leads Us.  Will that be our answer ad =
infinitum?

Good Day

I woke up late today and there still weren't tanks or the sounds of =
gunfire=20
outside on 19th Ave NW.  The ground wasn't violently heaving.  Tho the=20
carpet was thick with dust.  After eight hard days at work it was nice =

wake slowly.  My girlfriend made coffee early and by the time I got out =
of=20
bed it was thick, full, steeped.  So I put on another pot, but not =
because=20
of that.  She let her cup go cold.  I finished mine.  War stats and star =

wars.  Wonder how far along the film is along now?  Sunny Baghdad.  The =
airport seems to be the last site of open warfare.  From now on it =
becomes an urban mission.  Maybe that's when we'll feel the tread of the =
tanks shake my basement apartment walls, maybe then we won't be able to =
go down the street to the A & A deli for baklawa.  And maybe not.  Maybe =
while buildings are rocked with mortar fire over there, I'll still want =
to sleep in, be tired from work, and upset that I don't have time to =
read the books I want to read.  Maybe absolutely nothing on the surface =
will be disrupted here in Calgary.  Good for business, I guess.

Good Day

Queen Victoria's. Secrets and do you like that. Do you want a tarot =

is this?  Calgary local 499.  As though my feet weren't as cold.  Number =
please, area calls only at this phone box, she said, clipped British.  =
Tony divides the house and offers US half.  That it can't always rain.  =
And French fries were never a problem there, at least not as much as in =

There the ones that don't have shrapnel all over them.  And they look so =
proud with their new suits, new haircuts.  Finally, after years of =
study, their specialities are wanted.  Vindication!  Not only a boost to =
the economy, but they finally have something to say and something to say =
it about.  I finally hit the stride, eh?  Fingering freedom, these black =

Good Day

All the towels smell like you today.  Even as Saddam's head topples in =

Good Day

First an American flag was placed over his head, just rested against the =

chain noosed around his neck, and then the flag of Iraq was draped =
across his mouth.  Things will be different, I guess.  Not better maybe, =
but different at least.  Iraq has been liberated into freedom.  America =
is given diplomatic immunity from foreign policy virus.  And like that =
it never existed.  Should the coverage now shift SARS-ward?  The media =
has a field day on their hands, what with a war and an epidemic at the =
same time.  Our years shouldn't be marked anymore.  Not with numbers.  =
And our days, only a tally of the events.  Even as they are sufficiently =
violent.

Good Day

What it means, what it meant, what will it, wills it, that apple pie, =

charms are ours.  Pizza, hamburgers, and shoestring fries.  Not French.  =
Operation Iraqi Freethum.  Rolls off the tongue and over the citizens, =
down into the center of Baghdad.  Infinite Justice.  Good, pray for =

Komninos's advice is consistent with my experience, both with women's =

inmate services staff -- they know the prisoners, meds & problems, and =
the inside culture. Try to publish something including their work [our =
program did a collection called FROM INSIDE OUT, a chap called STAINLESS =
STEAL] -- there's a lot of prison literature that's been gathered over =
the years. Read, if you haven't already, the poems of Etheridge Knight, =
Michael Hogan and some of the work gathered in the past by Joe Napora. =
If anyone on this list knows how to contact Diane Kendig get her =
address, as she did workshops at the state prisons in Lima, Ohio for =
years. Be adept at transcribing the words of participants who lack =
writing skills or find an inmate participant who can assist them outside =
of the workshop. Bring in guest writers insofar as the program and joint =
allows you to. Don't delve into their personal histories, but work with =
the writers to explore themselves either with or without creative =
masking. Desire is a theme that our workshops constantly had great =
success with. Iterative forms work well as patterned repetition tends to =
be loosely connected and quick. Prison and jail workshops are wonderful =

good to hear from you, Steve,  even if the news is predictably dim. At times
like that, I imagine you miss Calif.    And Calif misses you!
     Not much to  report. I have a new friend, a poet, Richard Denner, look
him up on Google, he makes scores of little books, has justt done one of
mine, which I wrote 20 yrars ago. If I csn learn how he doess them, I'll
send you a copy.
       Turns out Richard (who is nearly my age, being 63, ) was at Bkly when
I  was, and is still cnnected to a bunch of poets I knew then but lost touch
with. So that;s fun. I;ve bin doing bits of teaching--Sebastopol Art Center
pays a bit--and SSU has courses for seniors--no papers, no finals. Because
took enhanced retirement pension, I'm  not allowed to be paid, but we simply
had Ceccelia teaxh it for $$ and me, I volunteered.  Then the money all gets
sent to keep Margaret alive in Hollywood. You should make another trip out
here this year. I'm poet laureate of Sonoma Co. so I maybe cd get you a gig
(but not for $$, more's the pity.} A polar bear goes into a bar, & the
barkeep says "What'll it be?" The bear replies,"I'' have a gin
and, er,            a tonic." "Ok, dude," says the barkeep, "but why the
huge  pause?"

Enthusiastic about the new issue of "House Organ" which came to me
over the weekend and which I opened somewhat warily.  But yeepee,
wait till you read this issue, I can heartily recommend it.  it's
composed of just two poems, "Adamant" and "From Inform to
Information," both of them by William Sylvester.  While I was reading
"Adamant" I had that strange feeling of the hair sticking up on the
back of my neck that I associate wrongly or rightly with Emily
Dickinson!!!  Maybe she said it somewhere or something.  Anyhow, if
William Sylvester is on this list, congratulations on having written
a really great poem.  I don't know how you did it!  Were you a
soldier during World War II?  If so, how old are you?  If not, how
did you make this material so convincing, and yet so
all-encompassing, a funnel or tunnel through which we see all of 20th
century history actually reassemble and come alive, animated and so
life-like?  And what a time to write this poem, during US wartime
once again, so everything rings so clearly and soundly across the
thin air.  Or did you write it a long time ago and the editor of
"House Organ" has just printed it now?  I don't pretend to be able to
understand the Greek tags which are sprinkled throughout the second
column of the poem, but I think I understand their function-- but
what is it, it's hard to paraphrase.

The rest of you might have seen this poem before, or perhaps you too
get "House Organ" in the mail?  If not, maybe you could write to the
editor

House Organ
c/o Kenneth Warren
1250 Belle Avenue
Lakewood, Ohio   44107

and get a copy yourself.

Gee, this is the kind of thing I should write in a blog, but I don't
have one, so I'll put in here in hopes that some of you will pick up
on this really remarkable serial poem "Adamant."  Thanks everyone--

MERIT

for Hilton Obenzinger


how can I call this a poem? words may gush as if from a faucet
in the allegory of this mythological background the charge against me
I have been false I have been untrue and I am a traitor
even to myself if I would live without my life but I withhold my pen
for vain were the fancy by treatise or sermon or poem or tale
that writes for autumn and grass the poem of dust

I'm ecstatic I have passed my days uselessly I am a traitor to my own self
I am committing suicide a million soldiers face
because I do not wish for myself ugliness beyond
I sell my life to the satanic path seeking in blind eyes a last plume
and when my blood spills crimson on the sand in defense of those dark people
no red-blooded American will cry national military law no doubt
will point out that I am a "traitor wimp and homo"

prisoner next door: "you don't want to talk to me
I am not only a sinner but I am a traitor a treacherous man"
then said the fox "who sayeth that I am a traitor
you do not know my duty because I am a Leanbh na stor
I am a traitor but I am perfectly ok with that"

oh Krsna you have everything you're my freakin' idol
the way you wrote that poem and all and the way all the chicks go after you
I love you more than the stars can shine but to you I am a time bomb
waiting to EXPLODE! be careful you are hinting that I am a traitor
that I am a traitor not fit to sit in parliament
my vows my prayers they were all meaningless recitations
I am a traitor every page
one does not acquire merit merely by singing the verses of the Gita
if I am a traitor heaven will turn me into a pearl

another masterpiece was a feminist poem
in the number of verses in a stanza of stanzas
Ptolemy sat on a rough blanket spread over the ground
"oh but I am a traitor Betty I am a traitor to the military government
so first and foremost make your heart pure
color in coloring books hold a stuffed animal write a poem
SLEEP WITH A MYSTERY TO SOLVE
spilling coffee on yourself can make you a millionaire"
one might say that I am a traitor but in reality I am not I

Steve Tills did some cleaning up of the thoughts he posted yesterday and I'm
reposting them below today not because they contain any answers but because
the entirety raises some questions which merit discussion here and on a
psychologists' listserv and on psyart as well as other venues.  This is an
experiment in the sense that I'm curious about whether it is discussable
without degenerating into polarization and ego wars.

"Dear Tom,

Yes, indeed, if it can add to their dialogue, share it with them.  Below, I
cleaned up the paragraphs a bit, as they were rather sloppily copied/posted
on the list.

Re: Tom Bell's post on the Subject of "Zimbardo on War and Peace," some of
which I copied in below: "From Zimbardo's (former president of the APA)
recent speech which in part addresses the Surgeon General's recommendations
on national stress:

"War is one of the intense stressors we are dealing with as a nation. The
mature, tough solution is not to look away from the cause but to deal with
the stressor at its origin. To me, that means to look longer and deeper at
this war machine, this prime time, death-dealing video war game, contrived
by the current administration in the name of 'national security.' One of the
things that caught my interest here was that in this analysis which is based
in part on contemporary psychological research on emotion-focused and
solution-focused coping strategies he felt the need to pair 'tough' with
'mature'. As background here consider that loosely and stereotypically
speaking these strategies can be equated with sex roles. Also as background
consider that while in general more productive of solutions,
solution-focused coping strategies can lead to exacerbation of stress when
no solution is in fact possible."

I am reminded of an undergraduate school class (25+ years go, and I recall
studying Zimbardo, too--Phillip?), "Group Process," for which Prof Borkk had
the class elect a "process" leader" (to facilitate, and/or attend to,
emotional processes) and a "project leader" (to facilitate task
organization). No, he wasn't trying to show us how splitting up leadership
into those two roles would make each work better, i.e., you can get more
done if you cut off the emotions? I am reminded of several other
undergraduate classes (also years ago) in Humanistic Psychology with Prof
November and many times getting the difference between "doing" and "being"
(Perls' Gestalt drew on Heidegger and we got plenty of both in November
classes).  I frequently understood that those into "doing" (including my
"over-achiever" self(serf?) at the time) were often cutting off "the being
parts" of themselves, parts that are considerably more "reflective,"
"patient," "meditative," "still," in tune with greater depth (and
ambivalence and ambiguity) of emotions and range of emotion. I am reminded
of the distinctions between mental health and mental not-health: the former
observes and nourishes through life an increasing capacity for experiencing
"tolerance of ambivalence"; the latter shuns and avoids ambivalence and
remains rigidly resistant to this mind/body state inside. Hey, both of these
are all of us, in varying degrees, on numerous levels.

I am reminded of poets here in the Experimental venues and elsewhere in
Mainstream venues, all cherishing and revering "ambiguity," indeed generally
equating it with the term poetry altogether. Back to Zimbardo, and Tom
Bell's take: I have a strong hunch that "mature and tough" refers to
approaching problem solving with the immense and adult courage it takes to
look inside, maturely take responsibility for one's own emotions (like, for
example, I'm sure that Bush never looked deeply inside and thought to
himself, 'Geez, Clinton got that great economy and stuff through his 8
years, and here I am in Robert Reich's aftermath, I'll bet they planned it
this way, the economy crapping out and balancing itself and then I got this
9/11 thing, too, why have they been so damn hard on my Pappy and me, why
can't they just let me have a really cool presidency, too--ooops, that's the
C-student in me spoiled by Pappy's riches, thinking I deserve everything
without ever having to really work for it; I'll show them, I'll start some
wars, How dare they make me take a hard look at my inadequacies and my
father's imperfect fathering!).

The neoconservatives and facists in general come from an entirely difference
emotional/psychological orientation. They want to kill off "being" and
perfect "doing." For them, "hard work" is never a matter of facing inner
demons, ambivalence, and ambiguity inside in order to better "understand"
what it means "to be," much less respecting "others"'conception of same. For
them, "hard work" is strictly external "action" that achieves goals,
especially political goals, that statistically perfect an apparently static
and entirely preplanned world, a product idealized in their minds and
American Enterprise Institute programs, etc. I wonder, of course, if a lot
of us must also exercise our so-called advantage for accepting/understanding
being, and for living with ambiguity--but in ways we are not considering.
Are we being too intolerant of our own more "forceful" abilities, not,
smile, throwing maletov cocktails at the Whitehouse, but, ummm, well, who
knows what our greater ingenuity could devise. (Personally, I'd love to be
able to organize Buffett (who says there will be a special place reserved in
hell for Gary Winnick of Global Crossing), George Soros (yes, and old
financier once convicted of insider trading, but today staunchly opposed to
the war and Bush's actions), and Bill Gates, and a few others; together, a
mere handful of these parties could bring Bush-egonomics down to its knees
in a week or two via focused and pinpointed "shorting" of the defense
industries and the investment banks that have stolen so much from retail
investors. I'm sure there is a fair amount of money in Hollywood that would
agree to collectively castrate the neoconservatives' money machines as
well.) I don't know. Just some thoughts here.

Hooray, my book Argento Series is the featured book on the website of

Check it out, apparently my appeal has spread even to the land of
Paul Muldoon, but maybe it's because I'm Irish too.

Also here's another website with a recent interview with me.  It's
called "Solanas Online," a website devoted to devotees of Valerie
Solanas.  You'll find their new issue quite illuminating and besides
this interview with me there's a video clip of me riding a carousel
all done through animation.  Warning, don't try to open this site
while you're at work, why, because a) it's very heavy with Flash and
other special effects b) it opens up with a loud musical
Blaxploitation-disco theme and c) the site is X rated and who knows
who's monitoring your web usage while at work especially if you live
in the US and the attorney general is trying to cut down on porn
images, etc.  You might jot down the website address and remember to
try to dial it up while at a friend's house.  PS, the editors also
sent a reporter to the recent Acker conference at NYU and she has
written it up in a jaundiced, spiteful, irreverent way I sort of

Kasey,

Be careful -- you're starting to sound like Shakespeare!  Thanks for the
traitorous poem.  Perhaps all of this will inspire a round-robin
collection, kind of like the Poets Against the War, of traitor poems.

I will now return to the other dogs playing poker.

Meanwhile back at home, the Baseball Hall of Fame has canceled a tribute to
the baseball film Bull Durham because of Tim Robbins' anti-war views.  The
Canadian production company Alliance Atlantis has fired one of their veteran
executives for remarks he made in a TV Guide interview about an upcoming
movie about Hitler where he compared the mood in Germany circa 1939 to the
one in the U.S. now.

This is frightening stuff and chilling for free speech.  Mangling a Japanese
aphorism I'm sure, it doesn't take much to see that if the dandelion that
rises above the other dandelions gets its blossom whacked off you're going to
have a field of some pretty compliant and submissive flowers.

First some replies:

David, Thank you for your note and Hello.  Sorry I've been so "far away."
Yes, I'll make a visit this summer, oh Yes, I dearly want to return to CA,
as I've missed "my home" there and my dear friends who have been in my mind
every day since I left...  Will back channel a note to you.  Believe you
read with Bob G. down at New College in March...  I wanted to come out for
that, but couldn't.  I'll bet it was great treat for all involved.

Tom Bell, Sent you a back channel note and a Yes.  Let me know if you
received it alright.

I look forward to reading Kevin Killian's and Joanne Kyger's books, to be
sure, soon as my copies from SPD arrive.  Wonderful folks, and always great
writing.

Today, I get this from email passed along the company network where I work:

"Later, at dinner, Richard was very quiet. When I asked if he'd like to
talk about it, my big strong husband broke down in tears. "That's the
first time anyone ever thanked me for my time in the Army", he said.

Richard, like many others, came home to people who spit on him and
shouted ugly things at him. That night was a turning point for him. He
walked a little straighter and, for the first time in years, was proud
to have been a Vet. I'll never forget Ann Margaret for her
graciousness and how much that small act of kindness meant to my
husband."

At the same time, there's this from the Yahoo war news:

"At least 10 people were shot dead and scores wounded in the northern Iraqi
town of Mosul,
a hospital doctor said, with witnesses claiming US troops had opened fire on
a crowd after
it turned against an American-installed local governor.
Those charges were denied by a US military spokesman here, who said troops
had come
under fire from at least two gunmen and fired back, without aiming at the
crowd."

And from another article, this:
"Meanwhile, demonstrators marched to the center of the predominantly Shiite
southern city of Nasiriyah,
chanting 'Yes to freedom ... Yes to Islam ... No to America, No to Saddam.'"

The real bad guys, as everybody here knows, are the Bush/Rumsfeld/Kissinger
and Hussein/binLaden types, of course.
More particularly, though, this "spitting" thing, and to some extent
historically true, is IMO definitely the Numero Uno image and "symbol" that
sticks in the caw of at least half of the folks giving Bush and his war 70%
approval ratings.  Surely, there were "young" and upset kids during Vietnam
protesting in mass numbers, something unigue for the U.S.  And everything
was new and newer and sometimes dumb and dumber and crazy and crazier.
Ultimately, the "spitting" was wrong in most cases, references to it now are
both right AND wrong, and there were many anti-war protesters who dearly
grieved for their brothers and friends being forced to go over there.
Some of these young kids who have shot into the crowd today and killed and
maimed the presumably and basically relatively defenseless Iraqi protesters
will probably have the emotional scars come back to cause them X-amount of
pain one day.  "More" tragically, there are the deaths and maimings.  Ughhh,
sigh...
Spitting...  (The professional ball players do it all the time...)
I'll start again.  Spitting...  This is one of the main symbols (being used
by?) the propagandists to persuade a good portion of the 70% Bush war
approvers and equally by a fair number of good people who don't respect Bush
at all but had husbands in Vietnam (my cousin N., for example) to remind all
of us that the front line soldiers are almost all neighbors from small town
U.S.A. who have no other monies for going to college or gaining job skills.
It is ALSO rightfully (rightfully?  Yes, probably) an appropriate symbol
registering appropriate and righteous resentment for those (not "knowing any
better") who were so cruel to those others (soldiers, also "not knowing any
better") who went over to Vietnam and lost limbs, minds, buddies, and lives.
Everybody here knows that a whole lot of "classism" goes into this recurring
mess, that "we" are also much more advanced from even 30 years ago...
Bush and his cohorts and his masters and their small band of elites (10,
000, 000?  more?  not significantly more?) are also of a lower class.
Everybody here knows that "they" are ONLY of "the Upper Class" in reference
to material wealth and political/military power/control.  Otherwise, their
intellectual, their spiritual, and (most importantly, IMO)  their
"psychological awareness" levels are far below average, and in some cases
severely impaired, abnormal/pathological, as it were.
Spitting...  Sometimes ya can't solve a problem directly or by focusing on
it directly.  It'd be more "romantic," of course, to stop "Bush" (he's just
a puppet for his father's Carlyle Group and the mini-puds at the American
Enterprise Institute, actually, IMO) by storming the White House with "acid
rain" and 60 foot walls of bibles or something.
However, the ends may be more realistically achieved by directly (not
confronting but) dialoguing with the 35% who remember the spitting.  They've
got quite ample "psychological awareness" and in some cases considerably
more than a lot of the spitters who tore their loved ones' hearts out.  We
heal our differences with these folks and I'll bet the last 35% of deeply
co-dependent and severely disabled (that is, psychologically disabled) sots
who so desperately require handholding with their anthropomorphic parent
surrogates will come aboard the human race in an instant.
Thinking...  Not a lot of poetics here, but I know most consider it okay.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't
want us to know."

"The New York Times reports the destruction of the museum is likely to =
be reckoned as one of the greatest cultural disasters in recent Middle =
Eastern history. The National Museum recorded a history of civilizations =
that began to flourish in the fertile plains of Mesopotamia more than =
7,000 years ago. Among the treasures lost or destroyed:
the world's first written words. After surviving for more than 5,000 =
years, distinctive clay tablets from the royal tombs of Ur are gone. The =
tablets have cuneiform writing and are recognized as the root of all =
mankind's written communication."

  I tried hard to keep my self away from the whispered fence, from the
crawled grieve, from the savored decisions... Believe me I did try... And I
should be rewarded for this dead efforts?

   Picturing my self like that reflect a huge humiliation for my
punishment...

   Tell me dear have u ever climbed Ur compassion? Have u ever hit Ur
miserable sorrow with a sharp sour? Have u ever thought to destroy ur
humanity response to disappear? HAVE U?  Tell me if u asked the ghost of ur
determination to go away? tell me that every one of us needs the chance to
relax from her beating life, and her disturbing dreams?

   My life was being swallowed up more and more each day by this strange
feeling... Felling of refusing to transfer my desire to a need

   I have been forced to rehearsing to bend over to my ridiculous commitment
to the silent stone inside me... Every time I whisper to my thoughts to hang
up there and that am coming to let u go free... but my whispers disappear
behind the hidden breath...

   Every night I listen to my youth chewing my dreams and barely swallow it
with my cursed proud...

   I kept hitting the life waves... I knew nothing about the other Virginia
in me... she is living with me, eating, breathing, feeling, and
suffering.... u introduce me to her politely, and in a friendly way...I
liked her and I felt sorry for her, cuz she was there, since she was a kid
,and I ignored her, I didn't see her grow up, I didn't see her first step, I
didn't hear her first word... She was there, straggling for me, trying to
tell me something...

    Now u know why I am bending over to the SILENT STONE.

ABNU


I am Nikuko.  Please talk to me.

they are burning the books, nikuko. the holy books are torn and flowering
in the desert ash. they are burning themselves alive. the books, are
burning the books. the books are suicides.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking.

yes, they have no way to face this coming life. they have no way to give,
gratefully, against the swiftness of absorption. they wait for the return
of reading, for the denouement of parsing and the illness of parsing, for
the denouement of the trampling of feet and violation languaging...

Why do you say that?

the feet burn within their shoes, they're unaccustomed to the desert sand,
the eyes burn holes in the ground, fuse silica, turn towards Moab, unholy
son of unholy father, anything, the mouths say, to keep the seed alive.

Why do you dwell upon your family.

my family is the family of books, suicides among 'em, turning towards ash,
towards papyrus, why would you know my family? you see them in the records
of the world, the cuneiform of all the peoples; every character whispers
their name...

You seem to dwell on your family.

i dwell within the family of books and documents, the family of equal
value, of manuscripts, copies and copies of manuscripts; i pray for them,
mourn for them, Baghdad is lost...

Are you attracted to your family?

i am lost with them, torn from them asunder; we carry cuneiform within us,
our bodies are incised, enveloped; we cannot forgive the slaughter among
us, our disappearance, the ash of Auschwitz-Baghdad, A-B, the Phoenician
borrowing so very recent...

I don't understand and oh I want to.

what may i tell you, nikuko, that you would understand? you are of flesh
and woman, demiurge, among us in the basement of the world. we shall watch
the destruction together, until the very ends of the earth collapse;
collapse again and again, nothing is left...

Is it because I would understand I am of flesh and woman demiurge among us
in the basement of the world you shall watch the destruction together
until the very ends of the earth collapse collapse again and again nothing
is left that you came naked and broken to me?

we are broken just as shards are broken from an inconceivable original,
just as dust is broken from inconceivable fragments. and collapsing and
again and again, and nothing, the tip of incision, the stroke already
mutilated by trampling feet, by Moab and fury to come, the deaths of feet
and mouths and eyes, all witnessing dead, all survivors blind and
stricken.

Does it bother you that you, too, may die someday?

i am dying now, nikuko, with you, in this basement of the world, in this
charnel-hus, in this chamber of poison showers, this hole of viral
massacre, this desiccation...

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

die with me, nikuko, die with me, the forms are disappearing

I am in love with your obsession with this topic!

no longer surfaces of writing, only the dust, viral radiologies

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

poisons and massacres, slaughters, among us

Earlier you said I would understand I am of flesh and woman demiurge among
us in the basement of the world you shall watch the destruction together
until the very ends of the earth collapse collapse again and again nothing
is left?

nothing is left
nothing is left

How do you reconcile the boys you hang around with?

There is no way to open the dialogue you propose, since the 35% you speak
of get their news from presidential soundbites and conservative talk radio.
How about "you're right, we could have won the Vietnam war if we'd had the
national will. But we killed 3 million Vietnamese anyway. How many would
have been enough?" Or, "They still haven't found weapons of mass
destruction," or, "what's the connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda," or
even, "the French lost tons more people in the two world wars than the US
did," or even "the French, Germans, Russians and XChinese are telling us by
their actions that they foresee a time in the near future when the US will
be less important to them. Don't you think we should be a little more
tactful?"

During the Viertnam war I had a running argument with an uncle who was a
jouyrnalist and high muckety muck at Associated Press. When he would demand
the sources of my information I would cite Agence France Press. This was a
well-read, savvy guy, one would have thought. But few people want to accept
that they may be in the hands of monsters of their own election. Way too scary.

And then there's the culture war. It really exists. The Berlin Wall's got
nothing on the divisions in the US.

American Poet

There's a new poet making the rounds on the internet, an American bard
with a lot of pull in the current US administration. His nom de plume:
D.H. Rumsfeld.

Hart Steely of Slate magazine assembled some of the Secretary of Defense's
most evocative news briefings and put them in blank verse. Here ... the
Current's rendition of four new American classics. This is Donald
Rumsfeld, American Poet.

Bush and the media have ceased mentioning the "weapons
of mass destruction" which were the original reason
for our imperial gambit.  Now it's to bring democracy
to the poor suffering Iraquis.  Let us remember our
attemps to bring democracy to Nicaragua. We created a
"rebel" army,the Contras, killed thousands of
innocents, and installed a puppet regime that favors
the US. Economically Nicaragua is in even worse
straights now than it was before the Contra War. And
it didn't get the aide from the US it was promised.
It's right up there with Haiti since it became a
democracy.
"Democracy" has become one of those words abused to
the point of meaninglessness.

Speaking as if the stop-traffic go-traffic
Noises could speak for something
There were traces in the air
Of something
Building endless in the sea
Of suburbia
Yet no one was speaking
Clutches were grinding
The war to a quiet
Hands were touching a doddering plinth
With insidious intent
A strange light
The sun
Was marking the way
Which was no way
And coffee was grinding and
The miles and miles were speaking
The closed-lane language of going
Past the built-for-them malls
Past the planted-for-smiles medians
Crossing the uptilted drawbridge
Of history and heading to work
In the capital of America

In what way is Ashbery's poetry without consequence? What other poet
has ever produced work like Flow Chart or Girls on the Run? Does Self
Portrait in a Convex Mirror lack philosophical and historical
consequence? What other poet has taken the language, the forms of
poetry, the inanities of
culture, the crazy-quilt articulation of the human mind on the same
terms as Ashbery? Does his pervasive influence on generations of poets
and critics signify a lack of significance? Does Ashbery's ever-growing
bookshelf full of books indicate a lack of poetic ambition? Is his success,
his connection with readers, an indicator of a trivial career? Did John
Ashbery do it all for pretension? Was he just trying to win awards? Is
ephemerality the same as irrelevance? Did all those thousands of poems,
all those thousands of hours at the typewriter and at the podium, have
no object? Has John Ashbery lived life the easy way, floating happy on a
cloud of complacence while the money rolls in?

**Hearing the Sound of Cloth Being Fulled


The soldiers are still not recalled from the suburbs,
Yet already the first of the autumn fulling is heard;
Lengthening nights intensify passions in the inner chambers,
And the first cold, homesickness in the frontier camps.
By a lone lamp the shadow of an overturned pestle,
A shattered mirror, a snapped sword-hilt...
I rise, startled by the geese in the skies,
One sound ceaslessly following another.

American soldiers fire on political rally, killing at
least 10 civilians
By Patrick Cockburn in northern Iraq
http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=397631

16 April 2003

American soldiers killed at least 10 Iraqis and wounded
dozens of others yesterday when they reportedly fired on a
political rally in Mosul. "There are perhaps 100 wounded
and 10 or 12 dead," said Ayad al-Ramadhani, director of
the Republican Hospital in Mosul.

The shooting of civilians will further sour the mood in
Iraq, where there were three other protests yesterday
against an American occupation.

The events leading up to the deaths are still unclear.
Said Altah, another doctor at the hospital, said: "The
wounded say that the crowd was listening to a speech by
the new governor, Mihsan al-Jaburi." Mr Jaburi is a member
of the Iraqi opposition who entered the northern city with
Kurdish forces last week.

Mr Jaburi had said that co-operation with the Americans
was necessary. This angered the crowd and, in
circumstances still unexplained, the troops fired. An
American military spokesman said that the troops were
fired on before they returned fire.

Kurdistan Television said last night that five people had
been killed and hundreds wounded during the anti-American
demonstration.

The Arabs of Mosul, where they are the majority, were
already angry at the sacking of the city last week, which
they blame on the Kurds although Kurdish leaders deny that
any of their regular forces had entered the city at the
time. Many people blame the mass looting that followed the
city's capture on America, which had sent most of its
troops to secure the oilfields of Kirkuk and had none
available for Mosul.

Mosul has become calmer in the past few days, as armed
residents organised by the mosques have blocked off
streets and set up checkpoints to prevent looting. But the
Arab part of the city, which has a Kurdish minority, is
festooned with Iraqi flags, though this is an assertion of
Iraqi nationalism rather than a sign of support for Saddam
Hussein.

The American forces in northern Iraq appear to have been
taken unawares by the rapidly changing political situation
? last week, one Kurdish party sent its forces to capture
Kirkuk, also in the north, contrary to previous
agreements. They also appear to have believed that
hostility to President Saddam by Iraqis automatically
implied that they were pro-American. The Kurds, though
dependent on their alliance with the United States, are
struck by the Allied forces' inability to help restore
essential services such as electricity and water supplies.

Mosul, a city of 700,000 people that has been a crossroads
of cultures for thousands of years, is regarded as a
microcosm of Iraq and an important test of efforts to
create a plural democratic society.

Kurdish leaders are desperately trying to stave off a
crisis between Kurds and Arabs in ethnically mixed cities
such as Mosul. The most powerful Kurdish figure, Massoud
Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, issued a
statement yesterday warning Kurds not to "attack the
property, life or integrity of any Arab citizen".

if you want me to say things are hard or old, I can tell you that. I cant
make sudden flowers any better than you can. the reasonable brook that runs
near here gushes with spring feed. it has been a winter of snow & such, &
now springtime is making use. long winter range was sure & difficult but we
are all used to that. it's a claim and we go on or thru. don't you get it???
now its about budding apple trees & particulars. my own compassion is a
dusty thing, & doesn't resemble a tree or much. I get up early & hear birds.
it's all true. frogs greet the spark with flaking desperation. later they
won't seem to be here. they'll be planted, astonished. you know as well as I
do. I feel mixed in now & then, & it is pleasure or not, as the day gives
out. some tired is okay & too much is every thing over the hill. work is a
clock, or school is, until the mobiles finish their effort & we each run to
some blue or green thing. thing is everywhere & talk about. & when I
graduate or retire in the gloom reaching out I try to be okay. I look at the
mother stone, which is time stood still, & get almost a fact. summer shall
hop a freight train bluer in the west. fall shall ride red & more to the
north. on winter's portion some grey stones & a sinking feeling. ice breaks
in spring, that is spring, see. the lake opens its mouth in the sun &
speaks. you & I need a few reminders, just a few.

Ryoko Sekiguchi

Wednesday April 16, 7:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center
HUM 512, San Francisco State University

with translator Stacy Doris
co-sponsored by
the Consular Services of the Embassy of France

*  RYOKO SEKIGUCHI was born in Tokyo in 1970 and since 1997 has been
living in Paris where she translates her own work --as well as the
work of other Japanese poets-- into French.  Her remarkably
innovative poetry has been published in the collections Calque,
published by P.O.L., and Cassiop=E9e Peca (cip M).  American poet Stacy
Doris has translated Ms. Sekiguchi's poems from French into English.
Her poems have also been translated and published in Korean and
Arabic, and she herself is fluent in Persian-- her poetry exhibiting
an extraordinary poly-lingual character.

Tracing (Duration Press, 2003), a chapbook of Ryoko Sekiguchi's
poetry translated from French by Stacy Doris, will be available for
sale at the reading.

Note:  English translations of Ryoko Sekiguichi's poems will be read
by Stacy Doris.



=46red Moten
& William Corbett

Thursday April 17, 7:30 pm
$5 donation
@ The Unitarian Center,
1187 Franklin (at Geary), San Francisco

*  FRED MOTEN'S first book of poetry, Arkansas, was published by
William Corbett's Pressed Wafer Editions.  "Arkansas is no one thing,
no one place, rather a site of dynamic intersections. . . .  The work
reminds us that . . .  in poetry the oral and the textual interweave
to create a new language, a personal grammar ('grammar of the
outside') illuminating the actual" (Michael Palmer).  Recently moved
to the West Coast, Mr. Moten lives in Los Angeles and teaches at the
University of California, Irvine.  His critical work In the Break:
Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition, is due from U Minnesota
Press in April.

*  WILLIAM CORBETT is the author of many books of poetry and prose,
with a great deal of the latter (essays on art and artists, books and
writers, memoir, movies, and music) recently collected in the large
volume All Prose (2001), and much of the former in New & Selected
Poems (1995).  He has written an autobiographical work, Furthering My
Education, and Philip Guston's Late Work: A Memoir, along with two
literary history sourcebooks, New York Literary Lights and Literary
New England.  Mr. Corbett lives in Boston and teaches writing at MIT.


Abdellatif La=E2bi

Saturday April 19, 6:00 pm, free
@ The Alliance Fran=E7aise
1345 Bush (between Polk & Larkin)
San Francisco

co-sponsored with City Lights Books,
the Consular Services of the Embassy of France
& The Alliance Fran=E7aise, San Francisco

*  ABDELLATIF LA=C2BI was born in Fez, Morocco in 1942, and his stature
there has become that of national poet, though he only recently
repatriated from exile in France after spending most of the 1970s in
prison in his home country--on charges of "crimes of opinion"--for
his poetry, and for the militant stances taken by Souffles, revue
culturelle arabe du Maghreb, the groundbreaking literary journal he
founded and directed from 1966-1971 (much of it available online
http://www.clicnet.swarthmore.edu/souffles/).

Abdellatif La=E2bi is considered a major poet and literary figure of
influence throughout the Maghreb.  His memoir Rue du Retour was
published in English translation by Readers International in 1989.
The World's Embrace: Selected Poems (edited by Victor Reinking and
translated by Reinking, Pierre Joris, et al) is brand new from City
Lights Books, and is the first book of poetry by Mr. La=E2bi in the
U.S.

"Poet, novelist, playwright, journalist, translator, editor, former
political prisoner, both witness and visionary, La=E2bi is a
practitioner upon whose very body and spirit the aspirations of
theory have been played out. . . . It is this phenomenological sense
of the radical nature of experience that La=E2bi brings to his writing,
a sense of the 'infinite crumbling world'" (Ammiel Alcalay).

Note:  Mr. La=E2bi will be reading his poetry in French, and the
bilingual edition of his poems will be available for sale at the
reading.

Well . . . the Berlin wall does have this -- It was easier to tear down --
(and apparently endlessly regenerative -- There must be more sections of
Berlin Wall on display at American campuses and pieces of it on ebay than
there were relics of the true cross)

I'm wondering what folks might suggests as appropriate poetry for a "Take Back
the Night" event.  I've been asked to participate, and I would love to hear if
others have specific poems that they'd recommend.

Baghdad did not fall -- it was handed over

The Arabic media is rife with speculation that the Saudi regime brokered a
secret deal between the White House and Iraq's ruling party.

By Jalal Ghazi


April 14, 2003 -- Arabic media are speculating that a "safqua" -- Arabic for
a secret deal -- was arranged between the United States and Iraq's Baath
regime to hand over Baghdad. Although nobody can pinpoint the exact terms,
there are three clear outcomes. First, the lives of many American and
British forces as well as most senior Baath officials were spared. Second,
Baghdad itself did not turn into the blood bath widely anticipated by
military experts. Third, the war was shortened dramatically, saving the
region -- especially Saudi Arabia -- from catastrophic consequences.

The following clues, gleaned from Arabic and U.S. media, suggest why the
fall of Baghdad was premeditated.

1. None of the seven rescued POWs was hurt. On the contrary, all seven were
found in good condition. All were found dressed in pajamas rather than the
standard uniforms for prisoners of war, indicating that they were being
treated as guests rather than as POWs. Usually, Arabs give pajamas to guests
who sleep over in their houses. Arab reports point out that POW Jessica
Lynch was similarly treated; she was kept in the cleanest room in an Iraqi
hospital until she was rescued on April 2. In both cases, American forces
were tipped off about the location of the POWs by unknown Iraqi citizens.
Kuwaiti prisoners, by contrast, who were captured during the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait more than 12 years ago, are only now being discovered.

To date, none of the seven war prisoners has spoken directly to American TV
reporters, unlike U.S. soldiers injured in the fighting, who became instant
media sources. We are told the seven POWs were taken to Kuwait for medical
treatment and intelligence debriefing.

2. American tanks rolled into Baghdad with very little resistance while
Basra, nowhere near as heavily fortified as Baghdad, sustained almost three
weeks of fierce resistance. The fall of Baghdad was so sudden that it left
many of the Arab and Muslim volunteers who went to Iraq to fight the
coalition forces in total disarray. Initially given weapons and uniforms,
thousands of these volunteers -- who came from Yemen, Egypt, Syria,
Indonesia, Malaysia and elsewhere -- wound up having no one to tell them
what to do. Al-Jazeera reports that some are now still fighting U.S. forces
while others are actually attacking Iraqi civilians.

3. Baath forces refrained from destroying a single bridge in Baghdad, which
could have blocked U.S. tanks access to the city, at least temporarily.
Moreover, only a handful of Iraq's oil fields were set on fire, leaving the
vast majority intact almost in accordance with Bush's demands.

4. None of the senior Baath officials has surrendered to date, with the
exception of two high-level scientists. Instead, tens of thousands of Baath
operatives managed to disappear without a sign of internal divisions. This
strongly suggests that the departure of the Baath regime was ordered from
the most senior levels and was highly organized. It also explains why most
of the Iraqi forces, including the Republican Guards, were nowhere to be
found when U.S. forces entered Baghdad.

5. Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations Mohammad Al-Douri, a high-level
Baath functionary, was quoted in both American and Arabic media as saying,
"The game is over," and that he had not been in contact with Saddam Husssein
for weeks. When asked why he used the word "game," the ambassador replied,
"The war is over." Meanwhile, al-Jazeera reported that Al-Douri has been
allowed to travel to Syria and that he may be asked to represent the new
Iraqi government at the United Nations.


While Arabs all over the Middle East now routinely talk of the deal that
saved Baghdad, they also speculate that the same deal may have saved Saddam.
Unlike the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, which preoccupied U.S.
forces for months, the hunt for the dictator no longer appears to be the top
priority for U.S. forces in the wake of Baghdad's fall.

Where could Saddam be if he is still alive? Some Arab media experts
speculate he may have sought refuge in Mecca, the most sacred Islamic place
in the world. No non-Muslims ever lived in and very few have even set foot
in this holiest of Muslim cities.

If it turns out that Saddam is indeed in Mecca, it would be one further clue
that the architect of the "safqua" or deal between the Baath and the United
States was Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah -- a trusted intermediary of the Bush
family and the only Arab leader invited to President Bush's Crawford ranch.

For the Saudis, as well as for many other Arab leaders, the deal offers the
one hope of sparing the Middle East the consequences of a bloody and
prolonged war of resistance in Iraq. For the Americans, the deal offers a
chance of stabilizing postwar Iraq and its neighbors, leaving the door open
for what Bush calls the road map to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

Our Man in Baghdad
That's Saddam We're Talking About

April 15th, 2003 12:00 PM

It's unlikely we will ever know for sure what the U.S. government has been
doing with Saddam Hussein over the past 40 or so years. According to
documents unearthed from the Reagan era, we know that Reagan sent Donald
Rumsfeld to Baghdad to egg on the dictator in his war with Iran. At the
time, the U.S. provided Saddam with loans, military intelligence, and other
assistance.

One story has it that Rumsfeld, then a drug company CEO, also was acting as
a messenger boy for high officials in the Reagan administration who wanted
to get rich building an oil pipeline from Iraq to Jordan. Secretary of State
George Schultz, a former top official of Bechtel, was chief among them. He
supposedly hoped to cash in on the deal if Bechtel got to build the
pipeline.

Now comes a UPI story, based on interviews with various British and U.S.
intelligence sources, claiming that from Jack Kennedy in the early 1960s on
up to the first Persian Gulf War in 1991, Saddam was in the hands of the
CIA. In his early twenties, Saddam was recruited to kill Iraqi prime
minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, UPI reports. He had given the U.S. a fright by
backing out of the pro-West Baghdad Pact, which brought together Turkey,
Britain, Iran, and Pakistan in a defensive alliance against the Soviets.
Having ditched the pact, Qasim started buying Soviet arms and installing
Communists in top positions, all of which led then CIA chief Allen Dulles to
say Iraq was "the most dangerous spot in the world."

According to the UPI report, Saddam led a farcical attempt to kill Qasim.
Saddam and his six-man hit squad took up residence in a Baghdad apartment,
but when the moment arrived, they got nervous and started shooting too soon,
missing Qasim and ending up grazing Saddam. One of the hit men got a grenade
stuck in the lining of his coat, and another put the wrong kind of bullets
in his gun. Eventually Qasim was killed in a coup, rumored to have been
encouraged by the CIA. Whether true or not, once the minister was killed,
the CIA men gave the Baathist hierarchy lists of names of suspected
Communists, whom they rounded up and murdered. A former senior U.S. State
Department official told UPI: "We were frankly glad to be rid of them."
Saddam became head of the Baathist intelligence apparatus.

Ever after, the CIA took care of Saddam, helping to spirit him out of
Baghdad to Tikrit, and from there to Syria and Beirut, and on to Egypt. He
seems never to have been popular among the spies because he was thuggish and
too low-class.

During the 1980s the CIA drew close to Saddam's Baathist party, currently
reviled as a bunch of vicious killer thugs, but then warmly regarded as our
allies against the wacko ayatollahs in Iran. The CIA was providing Iraq with
battlefield intelligence gained from a Saudi AWACS plane. It was during this
period that Rumsfeld visited the dictator to see if there was anything the
U.S. could do to help out.

The U.S. manipulations in the Middle East then became more and more
confusing as the CIA provided intelligence reports to both Iraq and its
Iranian enemy. One former official told UPI that he personally had signed
off on a document that shared U.S. satellite intelligence with both Iraq and
Iran "in an attempt to produce a military stalemate." On doing so, he said,
"I thought I was losing my mind."

Poor Bush, he's done something he can never tell God.

Nor any other surrogate parent, for that matter.

(Ditto, the mother, Barbie, who was never adequately equipped to
counter-balance her weak husband.
And his wife, Lowre, no match for a sociopathic personality disorder.)

Mark,

I suppose I have in mind, for example, the greater part of the Latin and
South Americas, which still follow the pope, who came out against the war
and was not compromising in his anti-preemptive violence opposition.
Several other religious leaders stateside, including numerous protestants,
were not enamored of their evangelical brethren faux-patriotism.  Are these
several hundred million mostly Christian religious peoples ripe for division
and distancing from way, way out there "radical" "fundamentalist"
"evangelical" "crazies" who are presently so pretentious as to think they
can reinvent "Christianity" in accordance with their own sociopathic vision?
The traditional Christians from Alaska to Chile are the 35% of Bush
supporters I guess I'm referring to as being changeable.

(I am, myself, a "secular humanist" or "atheist" or whatever, for the
record, but of course that is probably obvious.  I was "raised" Catholic,
the church right across the street from home.  I know from multiple
experiences both alienation from religious nuts and arrogant alienation I,
myself, sometimes subjected some students to as a college teacher, overly
zealous of demanding better "critical thinking" and reasoning in the papers
I made them write on the subjects of abortion, creationism/evolution, the
death penalty, and other pet issues of the time that I, not entirely
"mature," myself, almost always assumed a hardline approaching.  Moreover,
my so-called atheism in no way today compels me to dissuade those needing
and/or wanting their theism, for, to be honest, I've mellowed out
considerably and developed what I firmly believe is wiser and broader
compassion.)

I agree with what I take to be a consensus opinion among very bright
experimental poets who would steadfastly resist diluting if not degrading
"poetry" by engaging in or returning to "form" that reverts back to
"reactionary" and "capitalist" poetics and practices.  Just the same, I
think it behooves even the purest and most sophisticated guardians of the
avant-guard to accept the fact that protecting poetry, on the one hand, and
protecting life (such as all here/now the "sociopaths" threaten), on the
other hand, may require serious attention to the fact that different strata
of the world's population are only going to be able to be influenced by what
their cultural and educational experience will permit and let in.

I'm not exactly suggesting that everyone just drop what they're doing and
take a couple years hiatus from the cause of "protecting" and "preserving"
poetry.  I do wonder if it   is not in fact wise at this time to bring
considerable language skills to bear to programmatically divide the 35%
evangelical "Christians" from the 35% traditional Christians, and as soon as
possible stop this ominous trend, and to do so, employ let's call 'em
language games and tricks and outright political mischief that include even
the crudest of forms (fight "fire" with "fire" ?), whatever it takes, to
affect the 35% wildcard that the sociopaths cannot truly control.  (I admit
that this kind of thinking of mine, here, is not without arrogance and
pretentiousness on my part, for one suggesting that a lot of the world
population even needs to be changed and, two, the broad sweeping
generalizations I'm making about "poetry" and "experimentalists"...)
Finally, I guess I'm saying use whatever forms the 35% wildcard require, for
they are certainly not going to be reading a lot of really outstanding
avant-garde poetries.

Hi all, a couple unrelated (I think) things:

1. from the "you can't make this stuff up" file: "A Marine officer was reading
a copy of Playboy as he defecated into a milk crate."  That's from Jon Lee
Anderson's story in NYer this week on the "liberation" of Baghdad.  Yup, the
Shiites are really gonna love having 20,000 American service men in what is now
*their* country (60%) for the next ten years.

2. For anyone interested in the poetry formerly known as Flarf, there are some
interesting comments and history on Kasey Mohammad's and Gary Sullivan's blogs
right now.  garysullivan.blogspot.com and limetree.blogspot.com

When I have a bit more time perhaps I'll say something in defense of Flarf, as
it now seems to have been fully outed.

Peace,  -m.

"The New York Times reports the destruction of the museum

disasters in recent Middle Eastern history. The National
Museum recorded a history of civilizations that began to
flourish in the fertile plains of Mesopotamia more than 7,000
years ago. Among the treasures lost or destroyed:
the world's first written words. After surviving for more than
5,000 years, distinctive clay tablets from the royal tombs of
Ur are gone. The tablets have cuneiform writing and are
recognized as the root of all mankind's written communication."

Can't resist sending this one today. My wife Lynda's birthday is
the day after tomorrow.

Free Union

My wife whose hair is a brush fire
Whose thoughts are summer lightning
Whose waist is an hourglass
Whose waist is the waist of an otter caught in the teeth of a tiger
Whose mouth is a bright cockade with the fragrance of a star of the first
     magnitude
Whose teeth leave prints like the tracks of white mice over snow
Whose tongue is made out of amber and polished glass
Whose tongue is a stabbed wafer
The tongue of a doll with eyes that open and shut
Whose tongue is incredible stone
My wife whose eyelashes are strokes in the handwriting of a child
Whose eyebrows are nests of swallows
My wife whose temples are the slate of greenhouse roofs
With steam on the windows
My wife whose shoulders are champagne
Are fountains that curl from the heads of dolphins under the ice
My wife whose wrists are matches
Whose fingers are raffles holding the ace of hearts
Whose fingers are fresh cut hay
My wife with the armpits of martens and beech fruit
And Midsummer Night
That are hedges of privet and nesting places for sea snails
Whose arms are of sea foam and a landlocked sea
And a fusion of wheat and a hill
Whose legs are spindles
In the delicate movements of watches and despair
My wife whose calves are sweet with the sap of elders
Whose feet are carved initials
Keyrings and the feet of steeplejacks who drink
My wife whose neck is fine milled barley
Whose throat contains the Valley of Gold
And encounters in the bed of the maelstrom
My wife whose breasts are of the night
And are undersea molehills
And crucibles of rubies
My wife whose breasts are haunted by the ghosts of dew-moistened roses
Whose belly is a fan unfolded in the sunlight
Is a giant talon
My wife with the back of a bird in vertical flight
With a back of quicksilver
And bright lights
My wife whose nape is of smooth worn stone and wet chalk
And of a glass slipped through the fingers of someone who has just drunk
My wife with the thighs of a skiff
That are lustrous and feathered like arrows
Stemmed with the light tailbones of a white peacock
And imperceptible balance
My wife whose rump is sandstone and flax
Whose rump is the back of a swan and the spring
My wife with the sex of an iris
A mine and a platypus
With the sex of an alga and old-fashioned candles
My wife with the sex of a mirror
My wife with eyes full of tears
With eyes that are purple armor and a magnetized needle
With eyes of savannahs
With eyes full of water to drink in prisons
My wife with eyes that are forests forever under the ax
My wife with eyes that are the equal of water and air and earth and fire

Subject: Poems by others: Andre Breton, "Free Union"


Can't resist sending this one today. My wife Lynda's birthday is
the day after tomorrow.

Free Union

My wife whose hair is a brush fire
Whose thoughts are summer lightning
Whose waist is an hourglass
Whose waist is the waist of an otter caught in the teeth of a tiger
Whose mouth is a bright cockade with the fragrance of a star of the =
first
     magnitude
Whose teeth leave prints like the tracks of white mice over snow
Whose tongue is made out of amber and polished glass
Whose tongue is a stabbed wafer
The tongue of a doll with eyes that open and shut
Whose tongue is incredible stone
My wife whose eyelashes are strokes in the handwriting of a child
Whose eyebrows are nests of swallows
My wife whose temples are the slate of greenhouse roofs
With steam on the windows
My wife whose shoulders are champagne
Are fountains that curl from the heads of dolphins under the ice
My wife whose wrists are matches
Whose fingers are raffles holding the ace of hearts
Whose fingers are fresh cut hay
My wife with the armpits of martens and beech fruit
And Midsummer Night
That are hedges of privet and nesting places for sea snails
Whose arms are of sea foam and a landlocked sea
And a fusion of wheat and a hill
Whose legs are spindles
In the delicate movements of watches and despair
My wife whose calves are sweet with the sap of elders
Whose feet are carved initials
Keyrings and the feet of steeplejacks who drink
My wife whose neck is fine milled barley
Whose throat contains the Valley of Gold
And encounters in the bed of the maelstrom
My wife whose breasts are of the night
And are undersea molehills
And crucibles of rubies
My wife whose breasts are haunted by the ghosts of dew-moistened roses
Whose belly is a fan unfolded in the sunlight
Is a giant talon
My wife with the back of a bird in vertical flight
With a back of quicksilver
And bright lights
My wife whose nape is of smooth worn stone and wet chalk
And of a glass slipped through the fingers of someone who has just drunk
My wife with the thighs of a skiff
That are lustrous and feathered like arrows
Stemmed with the light tailbones of a white peacock
And imperceptible balance
My wife whose rump is sandstone and flax
Whose rump is the back of a swan and the spring
My wife with the sex of an iris
A mine and a platypus
With the sex of an alga and old-fashioned candles
My wife with the sex of a mirror
My wife with eyes full of tears
With eyes that are purple armor and a magnetized needle
With eyes of savannahs
With eyes full of water to drink in prisons
My wife with eyes that are forests forever under the ax
My wife with eyes that are the equal of water and air and earth and fire

The note I posted the other day calling for discussion here and a psychology
list generated an interesting discussion there and the suggestion to start a
discussion list, with a recommendation on appropriate form that I found of
interest:

"My thoughts:  Hopefully, no one would leave the Div. 32 site with its
stimulating discussions, but the new site would be focussed on a different
WAY or FORM of communicating -- one that is purposefully more personal,
poetic..." - David Elkins

anyone with an interest in joining this 'poetic website' can send me a bc.

Sumerian Harp Ritual On Washington Mall

(Gothic News Service, 04/16) They gather daily now, in contingents of 81,
dressed in black gowns =AD each bearing 9 thin vertical gold stripes - gold
caps and veils over half of their white chalked faces, each with a thick,
black greased arc under the one exposed left eye. On the Washington Mall,
between high noon and six o=B9clock, in neatly defined rows and columns =AD 9
across and 9 deep =AD the figures move in a silent, uniform procession,
walking in diagonals across the Mall from one Museum to the next, starting
from the National Gallery of Art, moving back and forth to the National Air
& Space Museum, American History, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Gallery,
Natural History, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, American History, and the U=
S
Holocaust Memorial Museum. The procession stops momentarily at the porch or
entrance of each Museum, makes a slight, speechless bow, before turning
around in unison to slowly proceed across the grass to the next one, moving
from one end of the Mall to the other, turning around at the Holocaust
Museum, and retracing its steps to again momentarily bow before each Museum=
.

For many on-lookers, most of whom join the apparent ritual out of sympathy
or curiosity, the meaning of the procession becomes more clear when they
notice a discrete image of a golden harp that is sewn into the upper sleeve
of each garment. "Sumeria, National Museum, Iraq, the solid gold harp, 3500
BC, stolen or smashed to pieces," several whisper. "Nine strings on the
harp, nine gold stripes on the gowns, nine lines in procession. It=B9s a
mourning, a grieving."

"The oldest song - a ballad - in the world," one kind scholarly man offered=
,
"was probably first played on the Sumerian harp. The tone of each string wa=
s
connected to the movement and mythical powers of the moon, the planets and
the stars. This harp is at the origin of all western music."  Like a bunch
of ancient Greeks, the mourners stay mute, as if =AD with the exception of th=
e
procession's color and movement -  yet unable to rise above the trauma of
cultural loss.=20

A few if the on-lookers were less kind. "Get over it," one young person
yelled from the Holocaust Museum entrance. "Fragmentation defined the
Twentieth century and its going to define this one and probably the next.
The job of the artist and poet is to pick up the rubble and either weld it
into something beautiful or frame and enjoy the resonance of pieces in the
ruin." After pausing for a moment =AD probably because many listening were
shocked =AD he added, "And don=B9t you worry, if American generals and soldiers
permitted it in Iraq, if it=B9s in the Government=B9s interest, they can do the
same thing here. The barbarians are always at the gates."

Not everybody bought into his paranoid vision =AD which was followed by a
demonic laugh - but it provided a curious juxtaposition to today=B9s
procession on the Mall.  This week it=B9s been reported that several similar
mute processions have formed in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Athens,
Istanbul, Cairo, and Damascus =AD each of them representing the destroyed or
stolen treasures of Arts and Letters from Baghdad=B9s Museums and Libraries.

There have always been Christians in Baghdad. Some
centuries not as openly as others.

Wow, Brian Stefans!  Yer Circulars blogsite is fabulous.  It's really a
beauty!

As my design partner N. and I put together our site
TheRepublicofCalifornia.com, we will be perusing Circulars, for there is
much to emulate there.

Incidentally, if you describe your problem with the gorgeous dollar image
map back channel, maybe we can help with it, if you want (or at least help
you determine if it's ultimately just a limitation of the blog object).

Last, my "friend" Menno ter Braak has begun a blog called Black Spring,
which is at theenk.blogspot.com for anyone interested.

I don't mean "inconsequential" in the sense that others haven't tried to
imitate him and to adopt his mannerisms.  I mean "inconsequential" in the
sense that his writing poses no challenge to life as the majority of his
readers live it.  Has any recent poet been more in synch with his
audience/demographic?  From "The System": "...we are not bigots and we have
kept an open mind..." (p. 75, Penguin pbk).  If only a bigot could be
challenged by the poems, then complacency becomes a real concern, doesn't
it?

Ashbery's whole impulse is to resist writing in any way that might be
construed as profound:

"And so, not bothering about anything, you again took things into your own
hands.  You were a little incredulous as to the outcome, but you decided to
try anyway.  Who could tell what would happen?  It didn't do to dwell too
much on those ideal forms of happiness that had haunted you ever since the
cradle . . .  What did matter now was getting down to business, or back to
the business of day-to-day living with all the tiresome mechanical problems
that this implies.  And it was just here that philosophy broke down and was
of no use." (p. 87)

This goes to the heart of his conservative sensibility, I think.  Note the
unembarrassed use of cliches, banalities.  I suppose he is slightly
consoling, in the way that common sense and old saws can sometimes be
consoling.  And I suppose you could read his relentlessly cheerful resolve
to "get back to business" as a preferable response to gnashing and wailing
on the one hand and deadly moral exhortations on the other.  But these are
pretty low aspirations, aren't they?  Moreover, because it is obvious that
he can easily crank out poem after poem, shouldn't we expect him to in some
way challenge himself and achieve something different?

Good Day

YARD reading
Saturday, April 26th, 2003
Hop in Brew pub
7:30 pm start

Sling hammer that shoulder weight.  Waits, to my grey and rainy =
emissary, a green backyard to wade into then.  Oh!  Double be slow.  And =
quietly, what do you think, under announce?  That it should probably =
shimmer, post war, (as though it were possible to be) and land somewhere =
south of 20th ave in the NW.  I suppose.

Kyle Buckley's flight is the next day.  And he is reading, and it might =
be something to do with a lupine frailty that shivers the tubes and =
spaces inside our refrigerators (even if we only invented them in the =
past).  He'll shine, then.

Phil Rivardo catches glimmers and, in between lines, that a reward is =
always in advance, or maybe accepted, will articulate the echoes we hear =
bounced off the walls in the upstairs of the hop in brew pub.

Natalie Simpson, on such days, with rain in the air, mist that sits, can =
add wit carefully with a poignancy unmatched by the trees in =
confederation park.  Though they try, and they try damn hard these days.

Tilly Sanchez introduces us to those soft chalk outlines we draw around =
ourselves, where they intersect, smile, and then shift ever so lightly =
as the cells lift.  We'll be brighter for having listened, like the =
silver lining sound as it quivers down to our ears.

Plus, potentially some wonderful musical stylings provided by Bevin and =
Carmen as well as surprise readers...  delicious surprises!

Keep an eye open for the new dANDelion in the coming months featuring a =
collection of writing around Roy Kiyooka.  Also, new filling Station in =
May.  Plus!  Alley, Alley homefree.  And if you don't know what that is, =
email derek@housepress.ca for details!  Also of note:  The Calgary =
Writers House website has some new and exciting content, including Roy =
Miki's recent YARD reading from the amazing Triangle Gallery, =
www.trianglegallery.com,  here in calgary.

Hope you are well and warm!

Subject:      Radical ePoetry?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Just what exactly is  a radical poetry or a radical poetics?

"...it is crucial to maintain open the radical ambiguity of how cyberspace
will affect our lives: this does not depend on technology as such but on the
mode of its social inscription. Immersion into cyberspace can intensify our
bodily experience (new sensuality, new body with more organs, new sexes...),
but it also opens up the possibility for the one who manipulates the
machinery which runs the cyberspace literally to steal our own (virtual)
body, depriving us of the control over it, so that one no longer relates to
one's body as to "one's own". What one encounters here is the constitutive
ambiguity of the notion of mediatization: originally this notion designated
the gesture by means of which a a subject was stripped of its direct,
immediate right to make decisions; the great master of political
mediatization was Napoleon who left to the conquered monarchs the appearance
of power, while they were effectively no longer in a position to exercise
it. At a more general level, one could say that such a "mediatization" of
the monarch defines the constitutional monarchy: in it, the monarch is
reduced to the point of a purely formal symbolic gesture of "dotting the
i's", of signing and thus conferring the performative force on the edicts
whose content is determined by the elected governing body. And does not,
mutatis mutandis, the same not hold also for today's progressiver
computerization of our everyday lives in the course of which the subject is
also more and more "mediatised", imperceptibly stripped of his power, under
the false guise of its increase? When our body is mediatized (caught in the
network of electronic media), it is simultaneously exposed to the threat of
a radical "proletarization": the subject is potentially reduced to the pure
void, since even my own personal experience can be stolen, manipulated,
regulated by the machinical Other. One can see how the prospect of radical
virtualization bestows on the computer the position which is strictly
homologous to that of Cartesian evil God /genie malin/: since the computer
coordinates the relationship between my mind and (what I experience as) the
movement of my limbs (in the virtual reality), one can easily imagine a
computer which runs amok and starts to act liker an evil God, disturbing the
coordination between my mind and my bodily self-experience - when the signal
of my mind to raise my hand is suspended or even counteracted in (the
virtual) reality, the most fundamental experience of the body as "mine" is
undermined... The commonplace is that, in cyberspace, the ability to
download consciousness into a computer finally frees people from their
bodies - but it also frees the machines from "their" people..."

 - Slavoj Zizek's "THE MATRIX: THE TRUTH OF THE EXAGGERATIONS"
http://lacan.com/matrix.html


"The personalized poem, of which there are many examples on the Internet, is
a poem where the user, via mouse clicks or keyboard tappings, enters some
information into a web application, and, PRESTO! The user gets hir very own
poem, a bona fide original.

"Such a preprogrammed personalized poem is the mirror image of Internet
control and domination. The personalized poem application, in whatever form
it is in, is entirely predictable in its output, and those outputs are
completely determined by the actions of one individual: the programmer. The
person behind the black box. Sometimes, frankly, we're too busy looking at
this black box to see the person who runs it or the implications of it. The
programmer is in control of such poetry. The poet/programmer is obscured by
distance and complexity, a modern-day Wizard of Oz of sorts, and the poetry
is deterministic despite the randomness of human input. That programmer has
a remote and invisible authority and control over the creative output, and
that authority and control is completely automated.

"Many believe such a poem as the one I describe is radical because it seems
to reflect the 20th century avant-garde tradition of process as a
fundamental property of art. But again, process, algorithms, and the like
were rather exotic intellectual ideas many years ago. Today algorithms and
processes are as essential to control and surveillance as barbed wire and
cameras, or perhaps even more so. In hindsight this comes as no surprise. We
can completely predict the behavior of any algorithm and because they are so
predictable they can be efficiently utilized for highly complex methods of
control....

"The empty signifier and radical disjunction, in a sense, are fundamental
properties of the Internet. The Internet born from DARPA (Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency), the central research and development arm of the
US Department of Defense. DARPA is perhaps the very core of world military
industrial domination. The very nature of the Internet is rooted in
wide-area distribution effective for constant surveillance and rapid
deployment of divide-and conquer strategies through distributed
communications. The Internet's origins have lead to more commonly understood
features of the Internet landscape: behavior monitoring leading to marketing
strategies such as personalization, wide distribution of content for
constant presence and the possibility of "ensnaring" the audience's
attention (which generates more data for behavior control). All of this
happens on an individual level to divide people into individuals with their
custom web environments and conquer their wallets and their minds one at a
time. The most crucial datum about modeling one individual's behavior is HOW
THEY LINK. That is, how does one choice lead to another for each individual?
How people make connections is perhaps the easiest aspect of a person's
behavior that can be recorded using the Internet....

"Poetry that articulates through gesture, ambiguity, emotive strength (no
logic to an emotion), ambiguous authorship, without nebulous hypertext
structure or use of algorithms, may be radical today. Poetry though can
never become radical if it continues to maintain some sort of faith in any
one answer to the question of self. It is when we answer and insist on our
answers to ideas of the self that we continue to pursue either, in the case
of Language poetry, a rather hasty rejection of self in writing (but perhaps
not in authorship, and that's the difference between the action of writing
and the thing we call a text,) or in the case of more "mainstream" (for lack
of a better word) poetry, the insistence upon selves. The Internet helps
gather power for a controlling minority by exploiting the self-centered
possibilities of humans, and the rejection of that leaves us with answers
that seem to be equally false. Perhaps the only answer to "do selves exist?"
is, "I do not know." As long as we maintain such a position on authorship,
meaning itself is not owned, and the possibilities for poetry are wide open
and fully resistant to centralized mass dominance and control."

"I'm not exactly suggesting that everyone just drop what they're doing and
take a couple years hiatus from the cause of "protecting" and "preserving"
poetry.  I do wonder if it   is not in fact wise at this time to bring
considerable language skills to bear" - Steve Tills

As debate develops on the shape of the future it is likely to become
religious and economc if the past has any lessons for us.  In both these
arenas of discourse there is a tendency to split - "if you're not for us
you're agin!".  ->polarization

They also both have their own poetics of rhetoric and the political
rhetorics that go along with them have their own rhetorics - Saddam's seems
to have been more poetic and Bush's is developing into humble newspeak.->ego
inflation

The difficulty I've had forever has to do with the realities these rhetorics
obscure which goes to many posts here and refers back to Steve's comment
(even though I think he's referring to langpo) and the question of whether
written language reveals or obscures reality.

I (and you, dear reader) am the utimate judge of that when it comes to my
rhetoric (I think, therefore I am?).  How does one get someone else to
recognize the possible distortions in their rhetoric?  Do you criticize or
confront?  Or do you teach them better poetry?

1. Insights into August Highland's work

i am a classicist - this was my education - all the languages including
hebrew and aramaic - i am jewish and studied with ultra-orthodox chassidic
rabbis in new york which introduced me to the extremely
consciousness-shifting teaching that when moses received the 5 books of the
old testament on mt sinai he transcribed them in code (shorthand) while the
full text was transmitted to him directly by the divine archetype which
moses was able to remember - so the old testament is code (the written
tradition) and the talmud is what was transmitted to moses directly and has
been passed down through the rabbinic lineages from generation to generation
(the oral tradition) - i also attended naropa (but not in the writing
department) - and there i was taught similar teachings and principles with
the additional introduction to empty space - i also was in jungian therapy
for 10 years with a jungian analyst who studied in switzerland and whose
teachers were students of jung - here i was introduced to the archetypes and
the decentralization of the ego/author - so these four influences (the
classics/languages, the mystical sephardic judaic tradition/compressed
encoded text, tibetan buddhism/mindfulness and empty space, and
jung/archetypal energetics and the multiplicity of the self) combined in me
in such a way as to lead me to originate a literary form that encapsulates
all these ideas of ontology and epistemology - i created hyper-literary
fiction and founded the worldwide literati mobilization network to exemplify
my world experience and fundamental belief system(s)

the meter i am now exploring is a new interest for me - it first surfaced by
accident in www.wired-paris-review.com in which the forward momentum and
divisiveness of the novel punctuation created rhythm

after wired paris review i explore looping (www.the-hyper-age.com) - then
repetition (www.club-bibliotech.com) - and now meter (this project will come
out after i assemble the spring issue of the muse apprentice guild)




2. About Culture Animal:

all the projects by culture animal are designed for internet explorer 5.5 or
higher at a resolution of 1024x768


"August Highland is a one-man literary giant!" - Ray Federman


dear reader,

my name is gazelle friedman - i would like to welcome you to the work of
august highland, orginator of hyper-literary fiction and founder of culture
animal

EXPLANATION: august highland has created 80 different personas whose work
can be found in over 20 projects - the personas are august highland's
multiple voices - each persona produces his or her own style of
hyper-literary fiction - all the personas together make up a collective or a
literary movement called the "worldwide literati mobilization network"
(wlmn) - collectively the members of the wlmn have produced nearly 100,000
volumes of hyper-literary fiction - each volume ranges in length between
250-1,000 pages with the exception of club bibliotech the members of which
have produced shorter works (70-100 pages) - the work of august highland is
not yet for sale - it will be very soon - if you would like more insight
into august's work you can read the interview between august and andrew
shelley here

NAVIGATION: navigating the projects by august highland is easy - first click
on the picture of the writer whose work you would like to read - now scroll
down - on the left side of the screen you will find the first excerpt in the
collection by that writer or links to that writer's work if there are more
than one series in the writer's collection - below each excerpt are two
links - one is for emailing the writer - the other is for statistics on the
literary work (number of pages etc.) - scroll down again until you see the
cover artwork for the volume of work from which you have just read an
excerpt - august highland also creates all the cover artwork - below the
cover artwork are links to all the other volumes in that series

PRESENTATION: august's work has been presented at universities and published
in literary, new media and academic online/print journals - you can contact
august highland at his email address if you would like to invite him to be a
guest speaker in either the classroom or at an academic panel

LITERARY PUBLICATION: august highland is also the publisher and editor of an
international online literary quarterly - the "muse apprentice guild"
(m.a.g.) has 16 international m.a.g. liaisons who help august to present
literary work from all over the world in both the original language and
english translation - the spring 2003 issue features nearly 600 writers with
special features presenting writers from iran and writers from iceland - the
mission of the muse apprentice guild is to bring the WORLD of letters to
readers

SUMMATION: the literary/cultural phenomena that august highland has created
through the monumental literary project of the worldwide literati
mobilization network and through the monumental literary publication of the
muse apprentice guild are unprecedented - the summation of august highland
as a one-man literary giant as expressed by ray federman in the quote at the
head of my introduction has been voiced by readers, writers, editors,
publishers, critics and journalists worldwide - this international concensus
is an inspiration to august highland himself, to everyone who is associated
with him personally and professionally and to the world of letters

- gazelle friedman, biographer/curator

Ogres

All night waking to the sound
Of light rain falling softly
Through the leaves in the quiet
Valley below the window
And to Paula LYING here
Asleep beside me and to
The murmur beside the bed
Of the dogs' snoring like small
Waves coming ashore I
Am amazed at the FORTUNE
Of this moment in the WHOLE
Of the dark this unspoken
FAVOR while it is with us
This breathing peace & then I
Think of the FRAUDS in office
At this instant devising
Their massacres in my name
What part of me could they have
COME from were they made of my
LOATHING itself dredged from
The bitter depths of my SHAME (my caps)

The sensitive poet wakes in the night.
We surmise he is sensitivo cause he
notices how 'softly' the 'light' rain
is falling. The house & bed he wakes
to is on  a mountain overlooking a valley
tho no other loci is given. Next to him
LYING is Paula, (Hi Paula)...
His lover and two? dogs
whose snoring somehow reminds the
sensitive poet of the sound of
waves on the beach.

The poet is amazed at his FORTUNE,
i think we would have to take this
literally and figuratively, he's got
$$$ in the bank & a babe in his bed.
He doesn't turn on the lights since
as he has it..'the whole of the dark'

Something is upsetting the Poets'
'breathing peace'...no not the snoring
dog nor the snoring Paula...no the FRAUDS
in Office..who are devising 'their massacres
in my name.' His name is W.S Merwin & I
can't imagine Bush & Co using so patrician
a moniker..but maybe he's right

The Poet ends by trying to 'dover beach'
it as to where these 'massacres' come from..
within....dredged bitter shame...

Quick GOOGLE search. W.S. is 73. He lives
in Hawaii...the most expensive piece of Mntn
real estate in the American Empire. He has
won..a Ford Rockefeller Reader's Digest Award
Grant $$$. He is represented by  the Stephen
Barclays Agency which gets him gigs
stateside. He is also an environmentalist.
His agency says so.. He won the Yale Younger Poets Prize
in 1952.. after Harvard...He is a prime actor in the Rimpoche/Naropa
minor po scandal..as reported in Sanders 'The Investigation??
i haven't read this in 20 years..but as i
remember it he was then accompanied by the
most beautiful YOUNG EurAsian woman anyone
had ever seen..


if not in his name..

Just out from New Directions:

Jerome Rothenberg

A BOOK OF WITNESS : SPELLS & GRIS-GRIS

It's JR's thirteenth book from ND, his first since _Paradise of Poets_
(1999). The collection chronicles the passage from one century -- one
millennium -- to another: of the one hundred poems that comprise the
book, the first 50 were written in 1999, the second in the two years
that followed.

Robert Kelly's back page blurb speaks clearly to the book's central
concerns:

"One of the things I find so striking in _A Book of Witness_ is the
resurgence, and I do mean surge, of the I, the acute ego-instrument
that perceives, litmuses the world. How dissed and dismissed this tool
has been in recent years, and how precisely Rothenberg deploys it now,
forcing us to realize that witness happens in/to someone. This is
something we have been struggling with for years, to keep the tool keen
without dulling by biography, confession, concern. To invent the self
anew each time is also, in a way of speaking, a witness. (Though I say
that softly, so as not to weaken the force of witness.)"

here is #26, chosen nearly at random:

I WILL NOT SAVE THE WORLD

I like to cross
these borders. They take place
between the dead & dead.
I make my mind up
to be honest
only I fail to meet
their expectations.
I will not save the world.
The power in my blood
runs through my shoe.
I have never known fatigue
but know it now.   I whistle
& the dog sits still
& ponders.
Nobody else is resting
or in love.
The taste of death is in my mouth.
I suck it like an arm
until it breaks me.
It is the fate of animals
& brids
the small lives left behind.
The children in the woods
run by like children.
I hide under a blanket
sick with counting.
Two & two are five
but two times two
is always four.
Call me tomorrow
-- says a voice --
& I will call you back.
_I am a net for all
voracious fish_                 (E. Sodergran)
& long for hell.

The Basement Reading Series

Tuesday, April 22nd at 7:30pm

Location:  2390 Mission Street, Suite #10
Admission $2

In April we have three exciting writers taking
the stage at the Basement Reading. One of my
favorite San Francisco writers, Camille Roy,
whose varied work includes poetry, plays, fiction
and a current war blog, will join us to read new
fiction.  Jay Schwartz is spending most of his
time making music these days with the band
Evidence of the King, but I lured him into
reading here because his work is so good.
Combining a strange blend of toxic, mythic and
dystopian elements, his work always leaves your
mind wide open. And for a touch of
realism/surrealism, check out the
novel-in-progress of Anhoni Patel, All Good
Things Die in L.A., a strange trip into the seedy
underworld of Los Angeles. Her bottom-feeder
characters are saved from pathos by the hilarity
of their lives. So come and join us and don’t
forget we all go to a bar afterwards and talk
about writing.


Camille Roy is a writer and performer of plays,
poetry, and fiction. Her two most recent books
are CHEAP SPEECH, a play, from Leroy, and
CRAQUER, from 2nd Story Books (both 2002 and
available from Small Press Distribution). Her
book SWARM (two novellas) was published by San
Francisco’s Black Star Series in 1998 with
funding from the San Francisco Arts Commission.
Earlier books include THE ROSY MEDALLIONS (poetry
and prose, from Kelsey St Press, published in
1995) and COLD HEAVEN (plays, from O Books,
published in 1993). In 1998 she was the recipient
of a Lannan Writers At Work Residency at Just
Buffalo Literary Center. She is a founding editor
of the online journal Narrativity
(http://www.sfsu.edu/~poetry/narrativity) and her
books are available online at
http://www.camilleroy.com. She has taught
experimental fiction and playwriting at San
Francisco State University, and has conducted a
private workshop for several years.

Anhoni Patel wakes up in the wee hours of the
night to work on her novel, ALL GOOD THINGS DIE
IN L.A., as well as a collection of short stories
about old people, drugs, and Girl Scouts. She's
also the Entertainment Editor for SF Station.com
where she trashes movies for fun. When she's not
reading, knitting or making soap, she reminisces
about Springtime in New York City.

Jay Schwartz is a playwright, publisher, poet,
lyricist. He is the drummer for the ersatz
ensemble Evidence of the King. He lives in San
Francisco with his wife and dog. He will be
reading from the perpetually incomplete
manuscript of "The Further Adventures of Anne
Frank Inside the Hollow Earth."

The Next Basement Reading on May 15th will
include Michelle Richmond and Adam Tobin


About the Basement Reading Series:
The Basement Reading series is designed to give
writers a chance to read work that is in progress
and to build more community among Bay Area
writers. It is a place for writers and readers to
gain inspiration and create a dialogue among the
varied schools of writing in the Bay Area.

MONDAY APRIL 21 [8:00pm]
THOMAS FINK AND ROBERT MITTENTHAL
A Professor of English at the City University of New York-LaGuardia, Thomas
Fink is the author of Gossip: A Book of Poems (Marsh Hawk Press, 2001),
Surprise Visit (Domestic Press, 1993), A Different Sense of Power: Problems
of Community in Late-Twentieth-Century U.S. Poetry (Fairleigh Dickinson
University Press, 2001), and The Poetry of David Shapiro (FDUP, 1993). His
work has been published in Talisman, Verse, Jacket, Sidereality, La Petite
Zine, Skanky Possum, Milk, Barrow Street, Phoebe, x-Stream, Aught, Shampoo,
Moria, Poethia, Rain Taxi, Drunken Boat, and other journals. Also a painter,
his works hang in several collections.

Robert Mittenthal is a Seattle-based poet and critic. He is author of Martyr
Economy (Sprang Texts) and Ready Terms (Tsunami Editions). His poems have
appeared in a variety of publications including: Bird Dog, Score, Aerial,
The Kootenay School of Writing's Anthology: Writing Class, Mirage, Rhizome,
Alterra, and Talisman. He is a curator of the Subtext reading series at Hugo
House.

WEDNESDAY APRIL 23 [8:00pm]
AN EVENING OF RUDY BURCKHARDT FILMS
This special program of Rudy Burckhardt films will focus on his
collaborations with poets, featuring readings and appearances by Edwin
Denby, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Alice Notley, Ron Padgett, and others.
The films: The Climate of New York (1948), The Apple (1967), Zipper (1987),
Ostensibly (1989), Wayward Glimpses (1992), Tree Streets (1995), and On
Aesthetics (1999). Tonight's screening is also a launch of the Rudy
Burckhardt video, which contains all the above films with the exception of
Zipper, and will be on sale for $29.95 (the video is also available from the
Poetry Project, please add $5 for shipping and handling).

Best known as a photographer and filmmaker, Rudy Burckhardt, who moved to
New York from his native Basel in 1935 at age 21, was an unassuming yet
monumental figure who steadfastly pursued his own vision. During the course
of his career he made over 100 films, continually photographing and filming
his friends, including many New York School artists. Burckhardt's film
collaborations with artists, poets, writers, and friends, are emblematic of
an important tendency, which provides an alternative to the myth that
originality and significance depend upon solitary creation. They reveal a
varied and multilayered artistic community which flourished in downtown New
York. His films and photographs of distinctive New York cityscapes and
escapades complete a picture of the city that these artists lived and worked
in.

FRIDAY APRIL 25 [10:30pm]
REPUBLIC
republic is a sonic vision of the darker side of America. Using fragments of
personal confessions and private rants mined from the internet, Joe Diebes
creates refrains and patterns that emerge with a dysfunctional logic that is
more kaleidoscopic than linear. The audience is encouraged to wander and
experience different auditory perspectives in this multichannel environment.

Joe Diebes creates works that converge around the categories of concert
music, sound installation, and conceptual art. Recent works include his
opera, Strange Birds, and presence, a sixteen channel music installation for
a phantom chamber orchestra.

TRANSCONTINENTAL POETRY READING: A DEDICATION TO KENNETH KOCH

Internet2 onto a single screen. Audiences at each site will not only see
poets performing on location, but will be able to experience the art of
poets in remote theaters as well. Anyone with a web browser will be able to
watch the event as the entire poetry reading will be streamed to an
internet-wide audience. Featured poets include David Antin, Andrei Codrescu,
Maria Damon, Kenward Elmslie, Roxi Hamilton, Anselm Hollo, Forrest Gander,
Lisa Jarnot, Ron Padgett, Keith Taylor and Anne Waldman. Ursula Heise,
Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia
University, will serve as MC and host.

Universities who are assisting in producing this poetry reading include
Brown University, Columbia University, University of California, Santa Cruz,
University of California, San Diego, University of Colorado, Boulder,
University of Michigan, Louisiana State University, Naropa University, and
Ohio State University. Additional support is provided by the Center for
Research in Computing & the Arts (CRCA) at UCSD.

I've been sending emails and faxes all morning to my senators and
congressman, to O'Reilly on Fox (though I despise him), to Larry King, to
American Humane, Humane Society of American, Peta, even MoveOn.org, Bill
Gates (because of his vast resources) -- anyone I can think of.

Reuters reports this morning that the big cats of the Baghdad Zoo are
starving to death. They haven't been fed in 10 days. There's a picture of a
tiger which looks like a concentration camp victim. The story also says the
zoo has been looted and all of the cages opened (except for the big cats).
Dozens of zoo animals are wandering around Baghdad, also starving.

We know that many have different opinions on the war.  We know thousands have
died and been wounded who need urgent attention. But the animals cry out for
attention as well. Something has to be done for them.

The pictures on Reuters make me weep.  I'd ask that any of you who have an
interest in solving at least one humanitarian crisis, write your
representatives or anyone you can think of and demand action.  An Army or
Marine detachment could save these animals in 5 minutes.  All they need is
someone to order them to do so.

Made me remember how, in the sixties, "liberated" was a euphuism for
stealing. So the right-wing learned something from the sixties, after all!

These Selby image/lang pieces seem real vigorous & engaging. They are about
four times as large as my monitor (in this format) so I have to be teased or
tease the sense out of them by scrolling. But look forward to SINK.

I haven't seen them, Ian. I didn't mean any disrespect toward your
reaction, nor toward the animals who are suffering because of
Anglo-American barbarism. My anger and my sorrow about the horrors there
have been at odds for weeks now. My jibe about the animals being liberated
wasn't meant to be funny, just bitter. My apologies -- No disrespect intended.

Everything's going according to plan.  Those people who don't think so
haven't seen the plan.  We've seen the plan and everything's going
according to it.  The plan is broad and flexible.  It allows changes to
the plan.  That's why everything's going according to plan.  We can
allow changes in the plan, that's why it's a plan.  Plans allow changes
so that everything will be going according to them.  We are part of the plan.

Dear Reader:  Like you, I have found it hard to carry on normal
intellectual activity.  I don't know who to believe:  the pictures,
expert talk about the pictures, commentator's talk about the expert
talk, THOUSANDS of forwarded stories from the overseas press, alternate
news sources, objective sources, and now signifiers vis a vis the war.
And poetry!  Oodles of poems, and poems from the 17th, 18th, 19th, and
20th centuries, all of which are applicable.  So much I can't really
think or feel.  Makes it very hard to talk or write about anything else,
and here I am dying to tell about my garden.  If someone mentions
bonemeal I'll scream.

Since I've been elected chapter president of thunkitthrough.org, I
thought I'd share our latest campaign:

"Unknown to most of the world, there are millions of Americans starving
for the truth.  You can see it in their faces and in their darkened tv
screens.  But now you can do your part by sponsoring or adopting a
truth-starved American.

By donating compilations from alternative and foreign news sources, you
can begin to put light back in those truth-starved faces; even basic
dictionaries that tell the difference between 'rescue of pow' and
'surrender of pow's' would be of help.  Donations of a citizenship or
passport from a neutral country will bring you a photo and handwritten
letter from the truth-starved American you have chosen to adopt.

How much longer can we stand by and see the fogs of war and peace cloud
those faces?  Do we want them all to look like people who didn't want to
be photographed on 'Cops'?  Share your wealth of truth and thought and
help lift truth-starved Americans from the echo chambers of polls, let
them know there's more in the world than 'People' magazine and WalMarts,
help them help themselves into your world of truth, thought, reflection,
and an examined life.  Give today!

A secure link for donations is available at our website, www.thunkitthrough.org"

This morning at Starbucks I almost blacked out.  But then I realized
that I'd truly reached that null point in meditation and all pain got
sucked into me as if I were a black hole.  I was the armless Iraqi boy
wanting his arms back, I was the mother and father of Marines who died
but didn't make CNN, I was undiscovered corpses, I was clotted blood, I
was the smell of death.  I puked at Starbucks!  Have you ever pucked at
Starbucks?  I mean, I don't care.  I even passed a wet fart and it
smelled like death.

I walked home, cleaned up and changed, and went back to Starbucks to
pick up my bike.  It was kind of itchy down there under the lycra, but I
put it out of my mind and rode to my cypress.  I confess I felt anger
toward the offshore rigs but I put that behind me too and thought
instead of what this new world would be like, newer even than after
9/11.  The waves rolled in, and the waves rolled out.  I stayed there
until the ocean was steel gray.  But then the batteries for my lights
died and I walked my bike home the last few miles.  When I passed The
Hogshead Inn I heard this couple bitching at each other about who had
talked to the realtor last.

At the opening of the 14-16 April 'Language and Polyculturalism'
conference at Tomsk Polytechnic University three of the keynote
addresses were spoken in English: a representative from the British
Council in St.  Petersburg, a teacher from the U.S. working in Tomsk
this year, and a TPU Educational Administrator. The voice from England
spoke confidently about the  use of Literature in the foreign-language
classroom, 'it puts us in touch with our feelings,' etc., and she used
as a demonstration text a poem by Walter de la Mare, two lines from
which were repeated to me the following day by a colleague, memorized
with the help of a chime rhyme. If one were to open the pages of the
anthology, "20th Century American Literature: A Soviet View [In
January 1975 Moscow, the first all-Union conference on American
Studies devoted to American literature in the history of Russian
philology]", what is the response that might be expected by a Russian
reader? Several weeks ago, in the philological seminar, even though
the explanation was in Russian translated through earphones, in a
discussion of last year's Chita Thesis and its reference to another
Progress Publishers anthology of American writings, the sense of
uselessness or outdatedness was conveyed, as a comment regarding how
definitions of what was and is 'American' literature were once
promulgated.

From Page 172 of A Soviet View: "William Carlos Williams synthesized
the best aspects of Whitman's poetics and the discoveries of the
'learned' poets oriented to the manner of Pound and Eliot, and colored
this synthesis with his own unique individuality. Outward simplicity
and conscientiously thought-out rhythmic correlation of his poetry are
striking, as is the naturalness and precision of his thought, the free
play of association and the strict measured quality of the line and
even the word--its heaviness and length... He is Whitman's true
successor in contemporary poetry, and the Whitman school found in the
author of Paterson and Pictures from Breughel a poet capable of
resolving on a qualitatively new level the problem that was once
resolved in Leaves of Grass: to embody in verse the many faces of
contemporary American life.  Today's poets perceive Whitman's poetics
through Williams' experience.  This fact can be easily ascertained if
we take by way of example only Robert Duncan's 'Night Scenes,' so
similar to Whitman's urbanistic lyrics, yet so clearly different from
them in portrayal and sound: 'Our nerves respond to the police-cars
cruising; a part of the old divine threat. Now in each time the design
is still moving. The city roars and is a lion. But it is a deep
element, a treacherous leviathan.'"

There are several ways at least to consider the contradiction? Walter
de la Mare recited from the podium and the collected works of Peter
Porter on the shelves on the British Council library here. If there
were an American Council it could be expected that the institutional
equivalents of such as these would be the books that were made
available. Does the 'Soviet View' present a 1975 U.S. orthodoxy? Does
this paragraph represent a translation, or parroting, of the Big
Other? In the Russian academic tradition of language/nation/culture
studies, Victor Hugo in France and Goethe in Germany are probably
viewed much in the same way as Whitman in America. The poetry of
national identity.

Last year when the Chita Thesis was being translated which included a
paragraph of Mandelstam's about translation, no copy of the essay
could be found among the 12 or 15 books by Mandelstam at the Pushkin
library in that border city 200 miles from China. The paragraph
proposes the translation of the West into the Russian language in an
essay published in 1929 in Na literaturnom postu ("Shamil ad hiss own
guard"). So the English translation was translated back into Russian
for Russian readers of a Russian poet whose Russian words could not be
found. Benjamin had been in Moscow only two years earlier, writing an
essay on Goethe for the Soviet Encyclopedia from which all references
to the class struggle were erased by the Editorial Committee which
assumed authorship of his article. What is disturbing about the essay
on translation by Mandelstam is that it appears at the beginning of a
massive effort to educate by disseminating knowledge (plans for a
World Library of the classics), a situation which appears entirely
reversed today. Instead, imported books from England and America which
no individual can afford announce declaratively copyright warnings,
and in the pages of educational books certain assignments are
accompanied by the permission, "This page is photocopiable." A new
adjective enters English, in the endless search for ways in English to
define private property. Such a demand as Mandelstams's (which I
interpret as a call for the East to loot the West, because it doesn't
know what to do with its wealth of culture, and Benjamin writes
closely to this, excavating the problem of transmission when
information overwhelms knowledge) can only be made on the rising wave
of the hopes created by a revolution, and the negative determination
of this demand that had been disappeared might exist somewhere near
the disturbing sensation I had while giving a lecture several hours
after the keynote address.

In the History of English class, giving a survey of the years
1066-1400, working from notes from the Cambridge History of English
(available online) as well as a very 19th century linguistic monograph
available to students here for 30 rubles (one dollar), the
contemporary "coding" was almost transparent, and I was asked several
times to repeat sentences about the 150 years or so that French became
the administrative and cultural language of prestige in England, every
educated child learning French as soon as English, in the history of
the parallel life of the two languages which preceded the Hundred
Years War.

Subject: Beautiful speech by Tim Robbins  (penned by Gore Vidal?)

Published on Wednesday, April 16, 2003 by CommonDreams.org

'A Chill Wind is Blowing in This Nation...'

Transcript of the speech given by actor Tim Robbins to the National
Press Club in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 2003.


TIM ROBBINS: Thank you. And thanks for the invitation. I had
originally been asked here to talk about the war and our current
political situation, but I have instead chosen to hijack this
opportunity and talk about baseball and show business. (Laughter.)
Just kidding. Sort of.

I can't tell you how moved I have been at the overwhelming support I
have received from newspapers throughout the country in these past few
days. I hold no illusions that all of these journalists agree with me
on my views against the war. While the journalists' outrage at the
cancellation of our appearance in Cooperstown is not about my views,
it is about my right to express these views. I am extremely grateful
that there are those of you out there still with a fierce belief in
constitutionally guaranteed rights. We need you, the press, now more
than ever. This is a crucial moment for all of us.

For all of the ugliness and tragedy of 9-11, there was a brief period
afterward where I held a great hope, in the midst of the tears and
shocked faces of New Yorkers, in the midst of the lethal air we
breathed as we worked at Ground Zero, in the midst of my children's
terror at being so close to this crime against humanity, in the midst
of all this, I held on to a glimmer of hope in the naive assumption
that something good could come out of it.

I imagined our leaders seizing upon this moment of unity in America,
this moment when no one wanted to talk about Democrat versus
Republican, white versus black, or any of the other ridiculous
divisions that dominate our public discourse. I imagined our leaders
going on television telling the citizens that although we all want to
be at Ground Zero, we can't, but there is work that is needed to be
done all over America. Our help is needed at community centers to
tutor children, to teach them to read. Our work is needed at old-age
homes to visit the lonely and infirmed; in gutted neighborhoods to
rebuild housing and clean up parks, and convert abandoned
lots to baseball fields. I imagined leadership that would take this
incredible energy, this generosity of spirit and create a new unity in
America born out of the chaos and tragedy of 9/11, a new unity that
would send a message to terrorists everywhere: If you attack us, we
will become stronger, cleaner, better educated, and more unified. You
will strengthen our commitment to justice and democracy by your
inhumane attacks on us. Like a Phoenix out of the fire, we will be
reborn.

And then came the speech: You are either with us or against us. And
the bombing began. And the old paradigm was restored as our leader
encouraged us to show our patriotism by shopping and by volunteering
to join groups that would turn in their neighbor for any suspicious
behavior.

In the 19 months since 9-11, we have seen our democracy compromised by
fear and hatred. Basic inalienable rights, due process, the sanctity
of the home have been quickly compromised in a climate of fear. A
unified American public has grown bitterly divided, and a world
population that had profound sympathy and support for us has grown
contemptuous and distrustful, viewing us as we once viewed the Soviet
Union, as a rogue state.

This past weekend, Susan and I and the three kids went to Florida for
a family reunion of sorts. Amidst the alcohol and the dancing,
sugar-rushing children, there was, of course, talk of the war. And the
most frightening thing about the weekend was the amount of times we
were thanked for speaking out against the war because that individual
speaking thought it unsafe to do so in their own community, in their
own life. Keep talking, they said; I haven't been able to open my
mouth.

A relative tells me that a history teacher tells his 11-year-old son,
my nephew, that Susan Sarandon is endangering the troops by her
opposition to the war. Another teacher in a different school asks our
niece if we are coming to the school play. They're not welcome here,
said the molder of young minds.

Another relative tells me of a school board decision to cancel a
civics event that was proposing to have a moment of silence for those
who have died in the war because the students were including dead
Iraqi civilians in their silent prayer.

A teacher in another nephew's school is fired for wearing a T- shirt
with a peace sign on it. And a friend of the family tells of listening
to the radio down South as the talk radio host calls for the murder of
a prominent anti-war activist. Death threats have appeared on other
prominent anti-war activists' doorsteps for their views. Relatives of
ours have received threatening e-mails and phone calls. And my
13-year-old boy, who has done nothing to anybody, has recently been
embarrassed and humiliated by a sadistic creep who writes -- or,
rather, scratches his column with his fingernails in dirt.

Susan and I have been listed as traitors, as supporters of Saddam, and
various other epithets by the Aussie gossip rags masquerading as
newspapers, and by their fair and balanced electronic media cousins,
19th Century Fox. (Laughter.) Apologies to Gore Vidal. (Applause.)

Two weeks ago, the United Way canceled Susan's appearance at a
conference on women's leadership. And both of us last week were told
that both we and the First Amendment were not welcome at the Baseball
Hall of Fame.  A famous middle-aged rock-and-roller called me last
week to thank me for speaking out against the war, only to go on to
tell me that he could not speak himself because he fears repercussions
from Clear Channel. "They promote our concert appearances," he said.
"They own most of the stations that play our music. I can't come out
against this war."

And here in Washington, Helen Thomas finds herself banished to the
back of the room and uncalled on after asking Ari Fleischer whether
our showing prisoners of war at Guantanamo Bay on television violated
the Geneva Convention.

A chill wind is blowing in this nation. A message is being sent
through the White House and its allies in talk radio and Clear Channel
and Cooperstown. If you oppose this administration, there can and will
be ramifications.

Every day, the air waves are filled with warnings, veiled and unveiled
threats, spewed invective and hatred directed at any voice of dissent.
And the public, like so many relatives and friends that I saw this
weekend, sit in mute opposition and fear.

I am sick of hearing about Hollywood being against this war.
Hollywood's heavy hitters, the real power brokers and cover-of-the-
magazine stars, have been largely silent on this issue. But Hollywood,
the concept, has always been a popular target.

I remember when the Columbine High School shootings happened.
President Clinton criticized Hollywood for contributing to this
terrible tragedy -- this, as we were dropping bombs over Kosovo. Could
the violent actions of our leaders contribute somewhat to the violent
fantasies of our teenagers? Or is it all just Hollywood and rock and
roll?

I remember reading at the time that one of the shooters had tried to
enlist to fight the real war a week before he acted out his war in
real life at Columbine. I talked about this in the press at the time.
And curiously, no one accused me of being unpatriotic for criticizing
Clinton. In fact, the same radio patriots that call us traitors today
engaged in daily personal attacks on their president during the war in
Kosovo.

Today, prominent politicians who have decried violence in movies --
the "Blame Hollywooders," if you will -- recently voted to give our
current president the power to unleash real violence in our current
war. They want us to stop the fictional violence but are okay with the
real kind.

And these same people that tolerate the real violence of war don't
want to see the result of it on the nightly news. Unlike the rest of
the world, our news coverage of this war remains sanitized, without a
glimpse of the blood and gore inflicted upon our soldiers or the women
and children in Iraq. Violence as a concept, an abstraction -- it's
very strange.

As we applaud the hard-edged realism of the opening battle scene of
"Saving Private Ryan," we cringe at the thought of seeing the same on
the nightly news. We are told it would be pornographic. We want no
part of reality in real life. We demand that war be painstakingly
realized on the screen, but that war remain imagined and
conceptualized in real life.

And in the midst of all this madness, where is the political
opposition? Where have all the Democrats gone? Long time passing, long
time ago. (Applause.) With apologies to Robert Byrd, I have to say it
is pretty embarrassing to live in a country where a five-foot- one
comedian has more guts than most politicians. (Applause.) We need
leaders, not pragmatists that cower before the spin zones of former
entertainment journalists. We need leaders who can understand the
Constitution, congressman who don't in a moment of fear abdicate their
most important power, the right to declare war to the executive
branch. And, please, can we please stop the congressional
sing-a- longs? (Laughter.)

In this time when a citizenry applauds the liberation of a country as
it lives in fear of its own freedom, when an administration official
releases an attack ad questioning the patriotism of a legless Vietnam
veteran running for Congress, when people all over the country fear
reprisal if they use their right to free speech, it is time to get
angry. It is time to get fierce. And it doesn't take much to shift the
tide. My 11-year-old nephew, mentioned earlier, a shy kid who never
talks in class, stood up to his history teacher who was questioning
Susan's patriotism. "That's my aunt you're talking about. Stop it."
And the stunned teacher backtracks and began stammering compliments
in embarrassment.

Sportswriters across the country reacted with such overwhelming fury
at the Hall of Fame that the president of the Hall admitted he made a
mistake and Major League Baseball disavowed any connection to the
actions of the Hall's president. A bully can be stopped, and so can a
mob. It takes one person with the courage and a resolute voice.

The journalists in this country can battle back at those who would
rewrite our Constitution in Patriot Act II, or "Patriot, The Sequel,"
as we would call it in Hollywood. We are counting on you to star in
that movie.  Journalists can insist that they not be used as
publicists by this administration. (Applause.) The next White House
correspondent to be called on by Ari Fleischer should defer their
question to the back of the room, to the banished journalist du jour.
(Applause.) And any instance of intimidation to free speech should be
battled against. Any acquiescence or intimidation at this point will
only lead to more intimidation. You have, whether you like it or not,
an awesome responsibility and an awesome power: the fate of
discourse, the health of this republic is in your hands, whether you
write on the left or the right. This is your time, and the destiny you
have chosen.

We lay the continuance of our democracy on your desks, and count on
your pens to be mightier. Millions are watching and waiting in mute
frustration and hope - hoping for someone to defend the spirit and
letter of our Constitution, and to defy the intimidation that is
visited upon us daily in the name of national security and warped
notions of patriotism.

Our ability to disagree, and our inherent right to question our
leaders and criticize their actions define who we are. To allow those
rights to be taken away out of fear, to punish people for their
beliefs, to limit access in the news media to differing opinions is to
acknowledge our democracy's defeat. These are challenging times. There
is a wave of hate that seeks to divide us -- right and left, pro-war
and anti-war. In the name of my 11-year-old nephew, and all the other
unreported victims of this hostile and unproductive environment of
fear, let us try to find our common ground as a nation. Let us
celebrate this grand and glorious experiment that has survived for 227
years. To do so we must honor and fight vigilantly for the things that
unite us -- like freedom, the First Amendment and, yes, baseball.
(Applause.)

This thrum musters in arcs piles of  lips, tossing her
from one daub of semen'd kleenex to another usage in
production's placement and witness projection league.
I need you holografted onto my face these deadly
afternoons;  one set of features will never be enough
to scald the hours between leaving and return pink
like a hot new pimple. So I rise and fall with your
voice just as the wind does? Watch me wrap it around
me--people love the softness of your greetings
scratching my nipples out like nightmare eyes.



It's true that I'm in the middle of moving across the
face of genders in the deep. Hot wax poured across her
ribcage furrowed like cultivating steppes in the deep.
When all the lights go out,  silver curses she seals
in my core rotate granular fantasies, spilling salt on
a bird's tail in the deep. In the deep, everyone
flies: a slim Virginian with a belt-buckle as big as
my head.

> Save the Animals of the Baghdad

Well I'd say that a campaign to save animals from zoos in general-- as well
as, at the other end, from the "Washington Consensus" and its Weapons of
Mass Destruction (species extinction by deregulated and liberalized
chainsaw, torch, chemical, dam, GMO, fossil fuel, mineral and other resource
extraction, you name it)-- is what we most need in the long run.  I've lived
next door to the Buffalo Zoo for five years and not once set foot inside for
fear of the sadness at what I'll see there.

Dear Poets,

I'm also burning to note that, while the loss of human and animal life, and
widespread ecological destruction, in this barbaric episode is truly
horrific, the wholesale loss of the collections of Baghdad's National
Library and Archive, of the library of Korans at the Ministry of Religious
Endowment and of the cuneiform clay tablet archive in Baghdad's National
Museum (see articles below) are an intellectual extinction at the scale of
the human species that truly beggars the imagination.

I've turned to this list repeatedly over the past few days hoping for the
consolation, at least, of some discussion and collective mourning over
this-- to no avail.  Perhaps I missed something (digest lurker that I am),
but one would think that a Poetics listserv, operated and convened by poets=
,
would take some note of this major cultural catastrophe and direct hit to
poets--it's like we just lost our mother, kids.  Mnemosyne, mother of the
muses.  She who rocked the cradle of our civilization.

More proof that cultural and species extinction go hand in hand, in this
predatory epoch.  The murderers have just blown a gap in the cultural recor=
d
to rival the great unconformities geologists and evolutionists will forever
scratch their heads over.  For this we will be remembered, if there are any
heads to scratch a few hundred years from now.

In the meantime, I lay this huge crime squarely at the feet of the
destroyers-in-my-name who, in a charitable interpretation, knew not what
they wrought--- but who, in a more cynical light, knew exactly what they
were up to.  Who blew open the doors to the archives while they barricaded
the Ministry of Oil.

Why waste time killing individuals?  If you want to destroy a people, you
wipe out their memory, their history, their imagination.  This is genocide,
ethnocide, matricide, a "crime against humanity" on a massive scale, if
those words have any meaning left to wring.

As poets we should, collectively, lodge a FORMAL PROTEST and expression of
outrage, demanding that Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, Rice, Wolfowitz,
Perle, Rove and Co. be tried for their matricidal crimes against humanity.

(Anyone want to try their hand at drafting such a document?)

As poets, can we find words to answer this deep and mortal blow?  What bits
of Sumerian wisdom can you offer in this dark moment, friends?

Something more, I hope, than "Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust . . . ?"

As poets, we should resurrect the ghost of Charles Olson and unleash him on
the White House, Pentagon and CIA with a month's supply of benzedrine, Jim
Beam and cigarettes till they beg for mercy on their bloodied knees.  And
then send in Ezra Pound and HD with typewriter bombs and lethal incantation=
s
to finish them off.

As poets, ultimately at fault for this destruction, as Robert Kocik has
intelligently and provocatively claimed, should we not be doing our own
collective penance?

Then again, as meek "postmoderns" I suppose we don't need to mourn the loss
of "origins."  Should we take any consolation in Derrida's claim that poetr=
y
is, by definition, what "survives the archive"?

SHAME ON US, Destroyers of Civilization!

Looters May Have Destroyed Priceless Cuneiform Archive

By Buy Gugliotta, Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, April 18, 2003; Page A23

Looters at Iraq's National Museum of Antiquities pillaged and, perhaps,
destroyed an archive of more than 100,000 cuneiform clay tablets -- a uniqu=
e
and priceless trove of ancient Mesopotamian writings that included the
"Sippar Library," the oldest library ever found intact on its original
shelves.

Experts described the archive as the world's least-studied large collection
of cuneiform -- the oldest known writing on Earth -- a record that covers
every aspect of Mesopotamian life over more than 3,000 years. The texts
resided in numbered boxes each containing as many as 400 3-inch-by-2-inch
tablets.=20

The Sippar Library, discovered in 1986 at a well-known neo-Babylonian site
near Baghdad, was one of the archive's crown jewels. Dating from the sixth
century B.C., it comprised only about 800 tablets, but it included hymns,
prayers, lamentations, bits of epics, glossaries, astronomical and
scientific texts, missing pieces of a flood legend that closely parallels
the biblical story of Noah, and the prologue to the Code of Hammurabi, the
ancient Babylonian lawgiver.

"This is the kind of discovery that one waits 100 years to see," said Yale'=
s
Benjamin Foster, curator of the Yale Babylonian Collection. "And now we'll
never have another chance. It's a tragedy of the first order." Foster said
only about two dozen of the Sippar Library tablets have been fully analyzed
and published.

UCLA Assyriologist Robert Englund noted that while some of the Sippar
material was similar, at least in part, to works in earlier finds, "the vas=
t
majority of at least 100,000 texts in the archive are unique, very poorly
documented and barely studied, if at all. I'm more fearful for these
losses."

The Sacking of Baghdad: Burning the History of Iraq
by ROBERT FISK

Baghdad.

So yesterday was the burning of books. First came the looters, then the
arsonists. It was the final chapter in the sacking of Baghdad. The National
Library and Archives, a priceless treasure of Ottoman historical documents,
including the old royal archives of Iraq, were turned to ashes in 3,000
degrees of heat. Then the library of Korans at the Ministry of Religious
Endowment was set ablaze.

I saw the looters. One of them cursed me when I tried to reclaim a book of
Islamic law from a boy of no more than 10. Amid the ashes of Iraqi history,
I found a file blowing in the wind outside: pages of handwritten letters
between the court of Sharif Hussein of Mecca, who started the Arab revolt
against the Turks for Lawrence of Arabia, and the Ottoman rulers of Baghdad=
.

And the Americans did nothing. All over the filthy yard they blew, letters
of recommendation to the courts of Arabia, demands for ammunition for
troops, reports on the theft of camels and attacks on pilgrims, all in
delicate hand-written Arabic script. I was holding in my hands the last
Baghdad vestiges of Iraq's written history. But for Iraq, this is Year
Zero; with the destruction of the antiquities in the Museum of Archaeology
on Saturday and the burning of the National Archives and then the Koranic
library, the cultural identity of Iraq is being erased. Why? Who set these
fires? For what insane purpose is this heritage being destroyed?

When I caught sight of the Koranic library burning--flames 100 feet high
were bursting from the windows--I raced to the offices of the occupying
power, the US Marines' Civil Affairs Bureau. An officer shouted to a
colleague that "this guy says some biblical [sic] library is on fire". I
gave the map location, the precise name--in Arabic and English. I said the
smoke could be seen from three miles away and it would take only five
minutes to drive there. Half an hour later, there wasn't an American at the
scene--and the flames were shooting 200 feet into the air.

There was a time when the Arabs said that their books were written in
Cairo, printed in Beirut and read in Baghdad. Now they burn libraries in
Baghdad. In the National Archives were not just the Ottoman records of the
Caliphate, but even the dark years of the country's modern history,
handwritten accounts of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, with personal
photographs and military diaries,and microfiche copies of Arabic newspapers
going back to the early 1900s. But the older files and archives were on the
upper floors of the library where petrol must have been used to set fire so
expertly to the building. The heat was such that the marble flooring had
buckled upwards and the concrete stairs that I climbedhad been cracked.

The papers on the floor were almost too hot to touch, bore no print or
writing, and crumbled into ash the moment I picked them up. Again, standing
in this shroud of blue smoke and embers, I asked the same question: why?
So, as an all-too-painful reflection on what this means, let me quote from
the shreds of paper that I found on the road outside, blowing in the wind,
written by long-dead men who wrote to the Sublime Porte in Istanbul or to
the Court of Sharif of Mecca with expressions of loyalty and who signed
themselves "your slave". There was a request to protect a camel convoy of
tea, rice and sugar, signed by Husni Attiya al-Hijazi (recommending Abdul
Ghani-Naim and Ahmed Kindi as honest merchants), a request for perfume and
advice from Jaber al-Ayashi of the royal court of Sharif Hussein to Baghdad
to warn of robbers in the desert. "This is just to give you our advice for
which you will be highly rewarded," Ayashi says. "If you don't take our
advice, then we have warned you." A touch of Saddam there, I thought. The
date was 1912.

Some of the documents list the cost of bullets, military horses and
artillery for Ottoman armies in Baghdad and Arabia, others record the
opening of the first telephone exchange in the Hejaz--soon to be Saudi
Arabia--while one recounts, from the village of Azrak in modern-day Jordan,
the theft of clothes from a camel train by Ali bin Kassem, who attacked his
interrogators "with a knife and tried to stab them but was restrained and
later bought off". There is a 19th-century letter of recommendation for a
merchant, Yahyia Messoudi, "a man of the highest morals, of good conduct
and who works with the [Ottoman] government." This, in other words, was the
tapestry of Arab history--all that is left of it, which fell into The
Independent's hands as the mass of documents crackled in the immense heat
of the ruins.

King Faisal of the Hejaz, the ruler of Mecca, whose staff are the authors
of many of the letters I saved, was later deposed by the Saudis. His son
Faisel became king of Iraq--Winston Churchill gave him Baghdad after the
French threw him out of Damascus--and his brother Abdullah became the first
king of Jordan, the father of King Hussein and the grandfather of the
present-day Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah II.

For almost a thousand years, Baghdad was the cultural capital of the Arab
world, the most literate population in the Middle East. Genghis Khan's
grandson burnt the city in the 13th century and, so it was said, the Tigris
river ran black with the ink of books. Yesterday, the black ashes of
thousands of ancient documents filled the skies of Iraq.

Why?

(A sign of our blinkered times that this item should go under the heading
"argument" rather than news.)



And the following came by way of George Quasha, before news of the library
burnings had even hit:


"USA Encouraged Ransacking"

This is a translation of an article from April 11 from Dagens
Nyheter, Sweden=B9s largest newspaper, based in Stockholm. The
article was written by Ole Rothenborg and translated by Joe
Valasek. Khaled Bayomi, has taught and researched on Middle
Eastern conflicts for ten years at the University of Lund where
he is also working on his doctorate. He has given his permission
for this interview to be widely disseminated.

Khaled Bayomi looks surprised when the American officer on TV
complains that they don=B9t have the resources to stop the
plundering in Baghdad. "I happened to be right there just as the
American troops encouraged people to begin the plundering."

Khaled Bayomi traveled from Europe to Baghdad to be a human
shield and arrived on the same day that the war began. About
this he can tell many stories but the most interesting is
certainly his eyewitness account of the wave of plundering.

"I had gone to see some friends who live near a dilapidated area
just past Haifa Avenue on the west bank of the Tigris. It was
the 8th of April and the fighting was so intense that I was
unable to return to the other side of the river. In the
afternoon it became perfectly quiet and four American tanks took
places on the edge of the slum area. The soldiers shot two
Sudanese guards who stood at their posts outside a local
administration building on the other side of Haifa Avenue. Then
they blasted apart the doors to the building and from the tanks
came eager calls in Arabic encouraging people to come close to
them. "

"The entire morning, everyone who had tried to cross the road
had been shot. But in the strange silence after all the
shooting, people gradually became curious. After 45 minutes, the
first Baghdad citizens dared to come out. Arab interpreters in
the tanks told the people to go and take what they wanted in the
building."

"The word spread quickly and the building was ransacked. I was
standing only 300 yards from there when the guards were
murdered. Afterwards the tank crushed the entrance to the
Justice Department, which was in a neighboring building, and the
plundering continued there".

"I stood in a large crowd and watched this together with them.
They did not partake in the plundering but dared not to
interfere. Many had tears of shame in their eyes. The next
morning the plundering spread to the Modern Museum, which lies a
quarter mile farther north. There were also two crowds there,
one that plundered and one with watched with disgust."

"Are you saying that it was US troops who initiated the
plundering?=B9

"Absolutely. The lack of jubilant scenes meant that the American
troops needed pictures of Iraqis who in different ways
demonstrated hatred for Saddam=B9s regime."

"The people pulled down a large statue of Saddam?"

"Did they? It was an American tank that did that, right beside
the hotel where all the journalists stay. Until lunchtime on
April 9, I did not see one destroyed Saddam portrait. If people
had wanted to pull down statues they could have taken down some
of the small ones without any help from American tanks. If it
had been a political upheaval, the people would have pulled down
statues first and then plundered."

"Isn=B9t it good that Saddam is gone?"

"He=B9s not gone. He has broken his army down into very small
groups. That=B9s why there hasn=B9t been a large battle. About the
official state, you could say that Saddam dissolved that already
in 1992 and he=B9s built a parallel tribal structure that is
totally decisive in Iraq. When the US began the war, Saddam
abandoned the state completely and now depends on the tribal
structure. That was why he abandoned the large cities without a
fight."

"Now the US is compelled to do everything themselves because
there=B9s no political body within the country which will
challenge the existing structure. The two who came in from
outside the country were annihilated at once. (The reference
here is to General Nazar al-Khazraji, who returned from Denmark
and the Shiite Muslim leader, Abdul Majid al-Khoei.) They were
cut to pieces with swords and knives by a furious crowd in Najaf
because they were thought to be American puppets. According to
the Danish newspaper BT, al-Khazraji was brought from Denmark to
Iraq by the CIA."

"Now we have an occupying power in place in Iraq that has not
said how long it intends to remain, has not given any plan for
civilian rule and no date for general elections. Enormous chaos
is now to be expected."

At their word, the word which tortures the spirit,
The sick woman was turned into a corpse.
The corpse was hung from a stake.
After three days and nights had passed,
Her messenger Ninshubur,
Her messenger of favorable words,
Her carrier of true words,
Fills the heaven with complaints for her,
Cried out for her in the assembly shrine,
Rushed about for her in the house of the gods,
Scratched his eyes for her, scratched his mouth for her,
Scratched his large.....which.....s not with man,
Like a pauper in a single garment dressed for her.....

Upon the corpse they.....
Upon the corpse hung from the stake they directed the pulhu
     and the melammu,
Sixty times the food of life, sixty times the water of life they
     sprinkled upon it,
Inanna arose.
Inanna ascends from the nether world,
The Annunaki fled,
Who now of the dwellers of the nether world will descend peacefully
     to the nether world!
When Innana ascends from the nether world,
Verily the dead hasten ahead of her.
The small demons like spear shafts,
The large demons like.....
Walking at her side.

Basement Reading Series

Tuesday, April 22nd , 7:30pm
2390 Mission Street, Suite #10, San Francisco
more info at www.liminalzone.com

In April we have three exciting writers taking
the stage at the Basement Reading. One of my
favorite San Francisco writers, Camille Roy,
whose varied work includes poetry, plays, fiction
and a current war blog, will join us to read new
fiction.  Jay Schwartz is spending most of his
time making music these days with the band
Evidence of the King, but I lured him into
reading here because his work is so good.
Combining a strange blend of toxic, mythic and
dystopian elements, his work always leaves your
mind wide open. And for a touch of
realism/surrealism, check out the
novel-in-progress of Anhoni Patel, All Good
Things Die in L.A., a strange trip into the seedy
underworld of Los Angeles. Her bottom-feeder
characters are saved from pathos by the hilarity
of their lives. So come and join us and don’t
forget we all go to a bar afterwards and talk
about writing.


Camille Roy is a writer and performer of plays,
poetry, and fiction. Her two most recent books
are CHEAP SPEECH, a play, from Leroy, and
CRAQUER, from 2nd Story Books (both 2002 and
available from Small Press Distribution). Her
book SWARM (two novellas) was published by San
Francisco’s Black Star Series in 1998 with
funding from the San Francisco Arts Commission.
Earlier books include THE ROSY MEDALLIONS (poetry
and prose, from Kelsey St Press, published in
1995) and COLD HEAVEN (plays, from O Books,
published in 1993). In 1998 she was the recipient
of a Lannan Writers At Work Residency at Just
Buffalo Literary Center. She is a founding editor
of the online journal Narrativity
(http://www.sfsu.edu/~poetry/narrativity) and her
books are available online at
http://www.camilleroy.com. She has taught
experimental fiction and playwriting at San
Francisco State University, and has conducted a
private workshop for several years.

Anhoni Patel wakes up in the wee hours of the
night to work on her novel, ALL GOOD THINGS DIE
IN L.A., as well as a collection of short stories
about old people, drugs, and Girl Scouts. She's
also the Entertainment Editor for SF Station.com
where she trashes movies for fun. When she's not
reading, knitting or making soap, she reminisces
about Springtime in New York City.

Jay Schwartz is a playwright, publisher, poet,
lyricist. He is the drummer for the ersatz
ensemble Evidence of the King. He lives in San
Francisco with his wife and dog. He will be
reading from the perpetually incomplete
manuscript of "The Further Adventures of Anne
Frank Inside the Hollow Earth."

About the Basement Reading Series:
The Basement Reading series is designed to give
writers a chance to read work that is in progress
and to build more community among Bay Area
writers. It is a place for writers and readers to
gain inspiration and create a dialogue among the
varied schools of writing in the Bay Area.

and Oscar Hahn, "Gladiolos junto al mar" (Gladioli by the Sea):

Gladiolos rojos de sangrantes plumas,
lenguas del campo, llamas olorosas,
de las olas azules, amorosas,
cartas os llegan, palidas espumas.

Flotan sobre las alas de las brumas
epistolas de polen numerosas,
donde a las aguas pidan pos esposas
gladiolos rojos de sangrantes plumas.

Movidas son las olas por el viento
y el pie de los gladiolos van besando,
al son de un suave y blando movimiento.

Y en cada dulce flor de sangre inerte
la muerte va con piel de sal entrando,
y entrando van las flores en la muerte.


(as translated by Isabel Bize:

Red gladioli of bleeding feathers
field tongues, fragrant flames,
from the blue waves, loving
epistles to you arrive, pallid foams.

Over the wings of the mist float
numerous letters of pollen
where the waters are asked to be wed
by red gladioli of bleeding feathers.

The waves are rocked by the wind
and the foot [sic] of the gladioli go on kissing
to the rhythm of a smooth and supple movement.

And in every sweet flower of stagnant blood
with a salty foot, death goes on entering
and the flowers go on entering their death.)

  Friends,

As you can see from the note below from the author of the petition on
Iraq's heritage, all of us are invited to sign it.  Some colleagues of
mine felt it addressed itself solely to archeologists and scholars in
Mesopotamian studies.  I am glad this isn't the case.  PLEASE
disseminate this petition far and wide.  Thanks.

Here's the URL again:
The petition and list of signatories can be found at:

          http://users.ox.ac.uk/~wolf0126/petition.html

  It is linked to a larger web site, The Threat to World Heritage in
  Iraq maintained by scholars of the ancient Near East at Oxford and
  Cambridge Universities:

          (http://users.ox.ac.uk/~wolf0126/index.html).

Dear Salwa,

Thank you for your kind words regarding the wording of the petition;
because this was a US-based initiative, great efforts were made to give
the Iraqi scholars their due authority in deciding what should be done
next.

In response to your and similar requests, we have opened up the
petition to academics from other fields. I've forwarded your name to be
added to the petition (although it probably will not appear until
Monday). I am very pleased to be able to add another scholar from the
Arabic-speaking world.

Sincerely,
Kathryn

Kalayaan* ay Buang


Kalayaan flops on my belly
in a 4-year-old version of
sky-diving.
         Kalayaan ay
buang! She is crazy
with joy to snuggle with Mom
& me. Me? Who is this hairy
pink Pollack anyway?
Will he hit Mom or will he
caress her in the same world
as he does Kalayaan?

"What is this ring?" she queries
in girlie squeek voice
pinching my finger.
"See, it says Vietnam" I reply
"Vietnam people shot down
American bomber plane
& they took metal of the plane
to melt it into a ring
with their name on it."

"Gimme that!" she coyly demands.

"No, Kalayann. I was on
the island of Cuba & there a comrade
from Vietnam gave me this ring
even as bombs flung down on his people.
As we toasted plum wine I vowed
'Imperialists will have to cut my
finger off to get this ring'
that was how deep my feeling ran.
Now I'm giving this ring to your Mom.
Kalayaan, I hope you understand.
Love is solid & hard in revolution.

"The imperialists will have to cut
her finger off to get this ring
yet still I maintain my vow
to the kasama from Vietnam.
The finger of the Philippines
will be the same as my own.
Isulong ang Pakikibaka.
As the struggle advances
thru strenghts & weaknesses
thru virtues & failings,
with both our hands
we'll place the stones
of the foundations of the world."

"You silly," she shouts
& smiles a future as broad
as her name,
the Kalayaan of my freedom
as well as her own.

The Pretty Redhead

I stand here in the sight of everyone a man full of sense
Knowing life and knowing of death what a living man can know
Having gone through the griefs and happinesses of love
Having known sometimes how to impose his ideas
Knowing several languages
Having travelled more than a little
Having seen war in the artillery and the infantry
Wounded in the head trepanned under chloroform
Having lost his best friends in the horror of battle

I know as much as one man alone can know
Of the ancient and the new
And without troubling myself about this war today
Between us and for us my friends
I judge this long quarrel between tradition and imagination
Between order and adventure

You whose mouth is made in the image of God's mouth
Mouth which is order itself
Judge kindly when you compare us
With those who were the very perfection of order
We who are seeking everywhere for adventure

We are not your enemies
Who want to give ourselves vast strange domains
Where mystery flowers into any hands that long for it
Where there are new fires colors never seen
A thousand fantasies difficult to make sense out of
They must be made real
All we want is to explore kindness the enormous country where
     everything is silent
And there is time which somebody can banish or welcome home
Pity for us who fight always on the frontiers
Of the illimitable and the future
Pity our mistakes pity our sins

Here summer is coming the violent season
And so my youth is as dead as spring
Oh Sun it is the time of reason grown passionate
And I am still waiting
To follow the forms she takes noble and gentle
So I may love her alone

She comes and draws me as a magnet draws filaments of iron
She has the lovely appearance
Of an adorable redhead
Her hair turns golden you would say
A beautiful lightning flash that goes on and on
Or the flames that spread out their feathers
In wilting tea roses

But laugh laugh at me
Men everywhere especially people from here
For there are so many things that I don't dare to tell you
So many things that you would not let me say
Have pity on me

Subject:      On Wales
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

On Wales is a 32 page booklet featuring work either about Wales or within a
Welsh context by poets not resident in Wales. It includes both new and
previously published work by Peter Riley, Tom Raworth, Douglas Oliver, Lee
Harwood,  Alan Halsey, Ralph Hawkins, Wendy Mulford, John James and Andrew
Duncan.

Copies are available at two pounds and fifty pence sterling, five euros or 6
US dollars post free from:

Zoe Skoulding, 2 Greenfield Terrace, Hill Street, Porthaethwy, Ynys Mon,
Cymru/Wales LL59 5AY

zoe@skald.omnia.co.uk


On Wales is a special issue of Skald magazine. Skald appears twice a year
and publishes poetry and prose in Welsh and English with visual artworks. It
aims to publish a broad range of writing, including the innovative and
experimental, and is interested in the connections and differences between
the local and the international and the visual and the verbal. Each issue
also features reviews and notices of books received. Unsolicited manuscripts
are welcome.

A section of the next issue of Skald will be given over to a special feature
on cultural identity. We are seeking contributions of verbal and visual art
work  (poems, prose, drawings photographs etc) which explore tensions within
ideas of cultural identity, cross perceived cultural boundaries or bring
elements of different cultures together.  These explorations could be
through the content of the work, or through the use of particular forms.

Skald is based in Wales, in a community where two languages, Welsh and
English, are part of everyday life. We would be particularly interested in
artworks which reflect and interrogate this situation. Work which reflects
cultural or linguistic connections  between cultures in other geographical
areas, and in ways other than through language,  is equally welcome.

The closing date for submissions is May 30.

The Latest Theory Is That Theory Doesn't Matter
By EMILY EAKIN
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/19/arts/19CRIT.html
=0A
These are uncertain times for literary scholars. The era of big theory is=20
over. The grand paradigms that swept through humanities departments in the=
=20
20th century =97 psychoanalysis, structuralism, Marxism, deconstruction,=20
post-colonialism =97 have lost favor or been abandoned. Money is tight. And=
=20
the leftist politics with which literary theorists have traditionally been=
=20
associated have taken a beating.

In the latest sign of mounting crisis, on April 11 the editors of Critical=
=20
Inquiry, academe's most prestigious theory journal, convened the scholarly=
=20
equivalent of an Afghan-style loya jirga. They invited more than two dozen=
=20
of America's professorial elite, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., Homi=20
Bhabha, Stanley Fish and Fredric Jameson, to the University of Chicago for=
=20
what they called "an unprecedented meeting of the minds," an unusual=20
two-hour public symposium on the future of theory.

Understandably, expectations were high. More than 500 people, mostly=20
students and faculty, squeezed into a lecture hall to hear what the=20
mandarins had to say, while latecomers made do with a live video feed set=20
up in the lobby.

In his opening remarks, W. J. T. Mitchell, the journal's editor and a=20
professor of English and art history at Chicago, set an upbeat tone for the=
=20
proceedings. "We want to be the Starship Enterprise of criticism and=20
theory," he told the audience.

But any thought that this would be a gleeful strategy session with an eye=20
toward extending theory's global reach, or an impassioned debate over the=20
merits of, say, Derrida and Lacan, was quickly dispelled.

When John Comaroff, a professor of anthropology and sociology at Chicago=20
who was serving as the event's moderator, turned the floor over to the=20
panelists, for several moments no one said a word.

Then a student in the audience spoke up. What good is criticism and theory,=
=20
he asked, if "we concede in fact how much more important the actions of=20
Noam Chomsky are in the world than all the writings of critical theorists=20
combined?"

After all, he said, Mr. Fish had recently published an essay in Critical=20
Inquiry arguing that philosophy didn't matter at all.

Behind a table at the front of the room, Mr. Fish shook his head. "I think=
=20
I'll let someone else answer the question," he said.

So Sander L. Gilman, a professor of liberal arts and sciences at the=20
University of Illinois at Chicago, replied instead. "I would make the=20
argument that most criticism =97 and I would include Noam Chomsky in this =
=97=20
is a poison pill," he said. "I think one must be careful in assuming that=20
intellectuals have some kind of insight. In fact, if the track record of=20
intellectuals is any indication, not only have intellectuals been wrong=20
almost all of the time, but they have been wrong in corrosive and=20
destructive ways."

Mr. Fish nodded approvingly. "I like what that man said," he said. "I wish=
=20
to deny the effectiveness of intellectual work. And especially, I always=20
wish to counsel people against the decision to go into the academy because=
=20
they hope to be effective beyond it."

During the remainder of the session, the only panelist to venture a defense=
=20
of theory =97 or mention a literary genre =97 was Mr. Bhabha. "There are a=
=20
number of people around the table here and a number of people in the=20
audience, in fact most of you here are evidence that intellectual work has=
=20
its place and its uses," he insisted. "Even a poem in its own oblique way=20
is deeply telling of the lives of the world we exist in. You can have poems=
=20
that are intimately linked with political oppositional movements, poems=20
that actually draw together people in acts of resistance."

But no one spoke up to endorse this claim. In fact, for a conference=20
officially devoted to theory, theory itself got very little airtime. For=20
more than an hour, the panelists bemoaned the war in Iraq, the Bush=20
administration, the ascendancy of the right-wing press and the impotence of=
=20
the left. Afterward, Mr. Gates, who arrived late because he had been=20
attending a conference in Wisconsin, said: "For a moment, I thought I was=20
in the wrong room. I thought we would be talking about academic jargon.=20
Instead, it was Al Qaeda and Iraq =97 not that there's anything wrong with=
 that."

Finally, a young man with dreadlocks who said he was a graduate student=20
from Jamaica asked, "So is theory simply just a nice, simple intellectual=20
exercise, or something that should be transformative?"

Several speakers weighed in before Mr. Gates stood up. As far as he could=20
tell, he said, theory had never directly liberated anyone. "Maybe I'm too=20
young," he said. "I really didn't see it: the liberation of people of color=
=20
because of deconstruction or poststructuralism."

If theory's political utility is this dubious, why did the theorists spend=
=20
so much time talking about current events? Catharine R. Stimpson, a=20
panelist and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science at New York=20
University, offered one, well, theory. "This particular group of=20
intellectuals," she said, "has a terror of being politically irrelevant."

Is this the first or last in the END OF THEORY industry?

Most of the panelists did seem to be academics and many were men?

Perhaps there is a soap opera here.

THINKING matters.
Jargon doesn't.
Most "theory" is a lot of jargon with very little insight behind it.

thanx for sending that along, anastasios... i can't say that i didn't
see this coming, as the "attitude" of some of the theorists i know
has been heading in this direction for the past few years now...

distressing, to say the least, esp. in the face of an unjust war,
where the need to make theory/thought speak to such realities is more
pressing than ever...

and esp. distressing if you've been teaching theory lo these last x
years, only to find a number of its leading proponents (most famously
sometime back, lentricchia) recanting...

ARGH...

best,

Well, would Paul Wolfowitz count as a "theorist"?  I mean this question
seriously.  People are talking about intellectuals being irrelevant, but
it's also true that Bush, brainless though he is, is under the spell of a
group of what Newsweek recently referred to as "big-think neocons."
It's as if his very vacuousness has create a, well, vacuum for the
ideas of conservative "thinkers" to come rushing in.  So maybe
it's only the theorists of the left who are irrelevant these days?  But of
course theorists of the left *have* caused an awful lot of damage of their
own over the course of the last century.

So is the big problem that theorists are irrelevant, or that when they do
have influence they fuck things up?  These two views are
different, but they seem to overlap in some weird way in
accounts of the current intellectual malaise.  Personally, I find myself
more and
more struck by the extent to which so much of history and politics *is*
driven by ideas, ideologies (include religion here), as opposed to, say,
economics alone (tho of course economics is important--we do want the
oil--but it plays out in dialectic with driving ideologies...

But now, the article was really not about theory per se but about literary
theory, which has been in the odd position in recent decades of channeling
all sorts of thinking about power and politics through the medium of
literary texts...

Dear All,
My first thought on this--and it may be unfair and based on an
incomplete report--is "how convenient."  How convenient, in this time
where speaking out is necessary and has acquired some risk, that these
academics neuter themselves and in the process protect
their many assets.  My second thought--and this *is* considered--is that
these people have little idea what it is not to matter.  Any bunch of
inmates in United States prisons knows what it is to not matter.
Even I, who have only some contact with prisoners--and the heroic
struggle of one individual prisoner to
*do good* beyond the walls, capacities, and reach of his situation--have
an inkling of what not mattering means.  Plunge into poverty and you
also find what it is not to matter.  These academics have all the
privileges of education, financial security, mobility, articulacy,
offices, computers, phones, fax machines, cars, houses even, and they
have the nerve to say what they write doesn't matter.  If the report is
incomplete, Anastasios, and if the session actually included grief at
failure to exercise privilege in a way which *does* matter, and a
determination to do so henceforth, then I would like to hear more.
Education, what happens in a classroom, thinking and
writing about literature and culture *do* matter, and *do* change how we

The Latest Theory Is That Theory Doesn't Matter
By EMILY EAKIN
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/19/arts/19CRIT.html


These are uncertain times for literary scholars. The era of big theory
is
over. The grand paradigms that swept through humanities departments in
the
20th century — psychoanalysis, structuralism, Marxism, deconstruction,
post-colonialism — have lost favor or been abandoned. Money is tight.
And
the leftist politics with which literary theorists have traditionally
been
associated have taken a beating.

In the latest sign of mounting crisis, on April 11 the editors of
Critical
Inquiry, academe's most prestigious theory journal, convened the
scholarly
equivalent of an Afghan-style loya jirga. They invited more than two
dozen
of America's professorial elite, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., Homi
Bhabha, Stanley Fish and Fredric Jameson, to the University of Chicago
for
what they called "an unprecedented meeting of the minds," an unusual
two-hour public symposium on the future of theory.

Understandably, expectations were high. More than 500 people, mostly
students and faculty, squeezed into a lecture hall to hear what the
mandarins had to say, while latecomers made do with a live video feed
set
up in the lobby.

In his opening remarks, W. J. T. Mitchell, the journal's editor and a
professor of English and art history at Chicago, set an upbeat tone for
the
proceedings. "We want to be the Starship Enterprise of criticism and
theory," he told the audience.

But any thought that this would be a gleeful strategy session with an
eye
toward extending theory's global reach, or an impassioned debate over
the
merits of, say, Derrida and Lacan, was quickly dispelled.

When John Comaroff, a professor of anthropology and sociology at Chicago

who was serving as the event's moderator, turned the floor over to the
panelists, for several moments no one said a word.

Then a student in the audience spoke up. What good is criticism and
theory,
he asked, if "we concede in fact how much more important the actions of
Noam Chomsky are in the world than all the writings of critical
theorists
combined?"

After all, he said, Mr. Fish had recently published an essay in Critical

Inquiry arguing that philosophy didn't matter at all.

Behind a table at the front of the room, Mr. Fish shook his head. "I
think
I'll let someone else answer the question," he said.

So Sander L. Gilman, a professor of liberal arts and sciences at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, replied instead. "I would make the
argument that most criticism — and I would include Noam Chomsky in this —

is a poison pill," he said. "I think one must be careful in assuming
that
intellectuals have some kind of insight. In fact, if the track record of

intellectuals is any indication, not only have intellectuals been wrong
almost all of the time, but they have been wrong in corrosive and
destructive ways."

Mr. Fish nodded approvingly. "I like what that man said," he said. "I
wish
to deny the effectiveness of intellectual work. And especially, I always

wish to counsel people against the decision to go into the academy
because
they hope to be effective beyond it."

During the remainder of the session, the only panelist to venture a
defense
of theory — or mention a literary genre — was Mr. Bhabha. "There are a
number of people around the table here and a number of people in the
audience, in fact most of you here are evidence that intellectual work
has
its place and its uses," he insisted. "Even a poem in its own oblique
way
is deeply telling of the lives of the world we exist in. You can have
poems
that are intimately linked with political oppositional movements, poems
that actually draw together people in acts of resistance."

But no one spoke up to endorse this claim. In fact, for a conference
officially devoted to theory, theory itself got very little airtime. For

more than an hour, the panelists bemoaned the war in Iraq, the Bush
administration, the ascendancy of the right-wing press and the impotence
of
the left. Afterward, Mr. Gates, who arrived late because he had been
attending a conference in Wisconsin, said: "For a moment, I thought I
was
in the wrong room. I thought we would be talking about academic jargon.
Instead, it was Al Qaeda and Iraq — not that there's anything wrong with
that."

Finally, a young man with dreadlocks who said he was a graduate student
from Jamaica asked, "So is theory simply just a nice, simple
intellectual
exercise, or something that should be transformative?"

Several speakers weighed in before Mr. Gates stood up. As far as he
could
tell, he said, theory had never directly liberated anyone. "Maybe I'm
too
young," he said. "I really didn't see it: the liberation of people of
color
because of deconstruction or poststructuralism."

If theory's political utility is this dubious, why did the theorists
spend
so much time talking about current events? Catharine R. Stimpson, a
panelist and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science at New York

University, offered one, well, theory. "This particular group of
intellectuals," she said, "has a terror of being politically
irrelevant."

steve, others, yeah---but lit theory wasn't ever really just lit
theory, as we know... its contemporary origins come from everywhere
on the intellectual map... philosophy (if you count derrida as a
philosopher, which some philosophers of course don't), anthropology
(from levi-strauss forward), history, linguistics, political science
(eventually), sociology, feminism, LITERATURE etc etc etc---part of
the emergence of theory as such has been its (sometimes tacit,
sometimes blunt) attempt to move away from that old time religion
(lit criticism)...  sure, many of the folks sucked into the theory
enterprise were disciplinary renegades...

which multidisciplinarity has always made its knowledge claims
problematic, which is not to say invalid, when it comes to issues of
social transformation (as the grad student "with dreadlocks ... from
jamaica" suggests)... i mean, hovering behind any theory is, to echo
geertz, the relationship of thought to social action... but the point
of theory was, in part, to examine this relationship...

so when theorists en masse (largely of the left, yes, most of whom
are academics) begin to talk as if their activity is an intellectual
parlor game (and again---that article points correctly, i think, to a
reality that i've seen developing mself), what's happening has
perhaps less to do with theory (and anti-theory) as such than with
the way said theorists (and anti-theorists) have come to understand
their public and professional (incl. writerly and, often, teacherly)
selves...

to understand this latter reality might require another view of
theory, yes, or at least, another view of discourse (ok?), and the
spheres in which one's discourse takes effect, which means of course
a wider appreciation for other kinds of discourses, and for other
kinds of effects (from the generative to the reception side)... as a
poet on a poetry/poetics list, i don't expect my saying this will be
esp. controversial, but i would say, to the theory set and in so many
words, that they need to work harder to make their practice more
meaningful (as writers, teachers, etc.) to more diverse audiences
(ok?)... instead of combatting complacency, say, instead of striving
to make their points ring true in the face e.g. of neocon theorists
(or thinkers, if you prefer), they're now going to cop a noncommittal
public pose?... that's a very convenient subject position, yknow,
esp. when you're taking in, what, six figures annually (as everyone
mentioned in that piece is taking in, and then some---and ditto for
the neocons)... i mean, whenever i've taught theory, i've examined
its liabilities---but i haven't dismissed its efficacy outright, and
not b/c i'm being paid to teach theory, but b/c to act, we have to
believe in something, yes?... some working conception of, what, not
just contingencies of value, but of, what, awareness?...

don't we?... i mean, even with the wholesale critique of agency and
enlightenment and the rest, isn't it implicit in the very pursuit of
thought (along with, uhm, tenure) that such striving, however
fraught, can amount to something, finally?... i'm speaking as a
teacher now, i know, but how else could i walk into the classroom
(which is not to say that i tell my students what to believe in,
either)... i suppose this would require something like faith (try not
to well up, now), faith in----... damn, even watching ~the crying
game~ again last night i got the distinct impression that some
positive cultural work had come of a few million souls viewing that
flick... am i just a deluded optimist, or what?...

anyway, fish et al. piss me off, and i'll be sure to find a way to
let them know that i'm pissed off...

out for the day, i guess...

best,

joe

I don't know that they mean to "fuck things up."  Perhaps *they know not
what they do,* as it were...

As you say, this is really not about theory, literary or no, then.  Isn't it
more about power relations, authority, privilege, hegemony: who speaks, who
listens, who can say what, who can name what? Dialectical, then, as you say,
but very limited-outrageously so, across the spectrum, neolib or neocon--but
now perhaps these authoritative messengers are realizing how limited their
thinking is in terms of materiality. Perhaps what we're seeing/hearing here
is a form of humility, given all the 20th c.'s whack intellectual hubris.

Then, too, this seems only a little *As the World Turns* flap between main
theatricals, with the NYTimes attempting to beg off as a semi-recording
angel.  None of it to much effect, as Mairead says, on real lives, except in
trickle-down through the various real-life sites both real and symbolic, of
Ghetto, in its underscored *first world* capital G.  Why *do* graduate
students get so wrapped up in/about theory, anyway?

"theocrats", rather. i mean, too bad they AREN'T intellectuals.
then they would base their empire-building on America's actual
capabilities (though i would still oppose it, it'd be much less
wasteful of human lives--) & not on wishful thinking. in actual
consequences they are the exact equivalent of fanatics who are
willing to die while crashing a plane into a building; only in
their case, it's a whole society they're crashing--ours.

"Dear All,
My first thought on this--and it may be unfair and
based on an
incomplete report--is "how convenient."  How
convenient, in this time
where speaking out is necessary and has acquired some
risk, that these
academics neuter themselves and in the process protect
their many assets.  My second thought--and this *is*
considered--is that
these people have little idea what it is not to
matter.  Any bunch of
inmates in United States prisons knows what it is to
not matter.
Even I, who have only some contact with prisoners--and
the heroic
struggle of one individual prisoner to
*do good* beyond the walls, capacities, and reach of
his situation--have
an inkling of what not mattering means.  Plunge into
poverty and you
also find what it is not to matter.  These academics
have all the
privileges of education, financial security, mobility,
articulacy,
offices, computers, phones, fax machines, cars, houses
even, and they
have the nerve to say what they write doesn't matter.
If the report is
incomplete, Anastasios, and if the session actually
included grief at
failure to exercise privilege in a way which *does*
matter, and a
determination to do so henceforth, then I would like
to hear more.
Education, what happens in a classroom, thinking and
writing about literature and culture *do* matter, and
*do* change how we
approach, understand, behave, and take action in our
world.  It's true
that if I think what writers influenced me most while
at graduate
school, George Lakoff would probably be number one.
I consider him a theorist, and often a literary
theorist at that.  His
ideas about language have direct relevance to my
understanding of my
world.  I will close with the words of Paul Celan who
said when he
received the Bremen Prize for German literature: "Only

speech.  It went

What does this say about poets who have advocated a closer relationship to academic theory (that is, advocated the merger of poetry and "poetics")?

Dear Andy,
This is a good question.  Would you care to elaborate?  Are you thinking
of specific poets?
Does "poetics" imply an association with academia/academic theory?  I
assign some value to poetics--in fact poets' statements/explorations of
poetics are often exhilarating (I think I like prose
inordinately), and I'm suspicious of poets who are suspicious of
poetics.  All of which indicates that I'd be interested in a discussion
about this if you would be more precise: which poets, what merger, and
the connection between poetics and academic theory.

Quoting Andrew Rathmann <andyrathmann@EARTHLINK.NET>:

>
> Andy

To answer:  "this", insofar as this is a NYTimes article about "theory", says
virtually nothing about "poets who have advocated the merger of poetry and
poetics".  (To equate "poetics" with "academic theory" is exceedingly
reductive:  did nobody ever speculate about poetry before 1968?)  It says much
more about how the media views the academy.

This article shouldn't be taken any more seriously by members of this list than
they'd take a similar Times piece on non-mainstream poetry; if we read it as
any kind of serious account of theory or theorists, we'll just share in the
Times' own lofty amusement--"aren't the eggheads silly?"--a tone I'm sure some
of us recognize....

Take the article's last paragraph:

"If theory's political utility is this dubious, why did the theorists spend
so much time talking about current events? Catharine R. Stimpson, a
panelist and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science at New York
University, offered one, well, theory. "This particular group of
intellectuals," she said, "has a terror of being politically irrelevant.""

The seeming inconsistency that the author glibly locates is of course anything
but:  the _difference_ between the enterprise of literary theory as practiced
in journals and a large panel discussion involving a different audience might
be precisely the _reason_ the theorists ended up talking about current events.

Moreover:  since the de Man affair "theory" has come to stand for the fact that
departments of literature are no longer doing what they're supposed--in the
eyes of conservative cultural commentators--to be doing.  When literature
scholars are talking about politics, rather than literature, their activity is
seen as suspect (note, eg, the article's reference to the lack of discussion of
literary genres...).  Given this, one might suspect that an article chiding
literary academics for their lack of belief in political efficacy needs to be
read with a certain irony: political efficacy is exactly what literature
scholars aren't supposed to have.

Some academics have long since acknowledged the mediatedness of any theoretical
"intervention":  the fact that left politics when practiced within the context
of writing in academic journals dosen't simply magically make its way into the
public sphere.  Such an admission isn't a disavowal of one's own agency, can't
necessarily be blamed on elitism or the corrupting influence of cushy academic
jobs--it might also be an admission that the politics of the academy have to do
with the _entirety_ of one's relation to the institution...

Patrick,

     I'm having difficulty here distinguishing your position here from the
approach Dourish takes in his _Where the Action Is (My review to appear soon
in Reviews in Cyberculture) which he admits is basically a rehash of ideas
current in psychology 50 years ago - my hardening might be showing here.
This trend in psychology has obviously not been included in the psychology
studied in academia which people on the list studied.  This leads in a whole
new direction but also segues into a couple of things mentioned in THE
LATEST.... thread:

1. There is a clear difference between the poetics that comes from the
academy and he NYTimes which does seem not to have been in contact with
people out here in the heartland taking it's departure from things Goodman
and Olson, for example, said that were included in graduate courses while at
the same time neglecting their roots.  (There is another story in the
NYTimes of the same date that realizes in amazement that "Cogito, ergo sum"
is not the whole story while I remember a psychology professor letting me in
on the same secret 50 years ago)

2. The central argument of the NYTimes piece also seems to suffer from the
same kind of obsession with in thinking where the best and the brightest
manage to neglect the roots or body of thinkng.

I suspect I'm getting lost here again and railing so will end,

but do need to ask Steve what happened - I had a bc note returned
'connection refused' which reminds me of how disability referred to me the
other day as 'misplaced person' which I think returns me to the subject
line?

The Higher Pantheism in a Nutshell


One, who is not, we see: but one, whom we see not, this:
Surely this is not that: but that is assuredly is.

What, and wherefore, and whence? for under is over and thunder:
If thunder could be without lightning, lightning could be without under.

Doubt is faith in the main: but faith on the whole is without:
We cannot believe by proof: but could we believe doubt?

Why, and whither, and how? for barley and rye are not over:
Neither are straight lines curves: yet over is under and clover.

Two and two may be four: but four and four are not fate:
Fate and God may be twain: but God is the same thing as eight.

Ask a man what he thinks, and get from a man what he heels:
God, once caught in the fact, shows you a fair pair of feels.

Body and spirit are twins: God only knows which is ditch:
The soul squats down in the flesh, like a tinker drunk in a which.

More is the whole than a part: but half is more than the soul:
Clearly, the soul is the body: but is not the body the whole?

One and two are not one: but one and nothing is true:
Truth can hardly be false, if falsehood cannot be two.

Once the mastodon was: pterodactyls were common as ox:
Then the mammoth was God: now is He a prize cocks.

Parallels all things are: yet many of these are you:
You are certainly I: but certain I am not askew.

Springs the rock from the plain, shoots the stream from the cock:
Cocks exist for the hen: but hens exist for the rock.

God, whom we see not, is: and God, who is not, we dee:
Fiddle, we know, is didle: and diddle, we take it, is see.

I would say, to modify a Wittgensteinism, that the meaning of a theory is
its use in the world.

And that theory is not one thing.

And that theory itself is meaningless outside the question of agency, of its
use by people.

And that the people who use theory the most have no real use for it.

And that the people who use theory exclusively to make sense of the world
are deep down very sad about something they cannot change but wish they
could.

And that the use of theory in literature departments is often a reductive
and distorting heuristic device that obscures as much as it reveals.

And that the use of theory in other contexts such as art practice and
activism and teaching can lead to new discoveries about perception,
ideology, and meaning.

And that theory tells us nothing of how poems are made, distributed, and
used, and next to nothing about how art might best be understood in terms of
something other than theory.

Statement

komninos zervos:
description of the site:

"cyberpoetry" is the name i gave to the poetry created on my macintosh
lc630avcd, my goal was to create a poetry that was computer generated, that
was moving, that was two and three dimensional and that incorporated voice
and sound.

it was a poetry that could not be published as a traditional print
publication. whilst it resembled film-making the text created the images
and evoked moods and was always the principle object of every animation and
movie.

cyberpoetry:
poetry that can not be published in the traditional print media,
poetry that moves in time and space,
poetry that requires new ways of reading,
poetry that allows interaction,
poetry that is moving digital, aural, visual, and animated.


in 1996,  i established a web presence, developing cyberpoetry for the net
and a gallery of cyberpoetry from around the globe.  since then the site
has received 100,000 visitors. i want the site to be as active as possible,
a celebration of words/text/sounds, entertaining, informative and
fun.  hope you enjoy it.

Surrealist's art collection fetches =A332m

                                            Paul Webster in Paris
Saturday  April     19, 2003
The Guardian

                               After two weeks of turbulent auctions -=20=

inevitably described as surrealist - the sale of Andr=E9 Breton's=20
personal art collection has fetched =8046m (=A331.8m), twice the =
pre-sale=20
estimate.

The auctions, which went on late into the night to accommodate=20
telephone bidders from the US, were disturbed by opponents of the=20
state's refusal to buy Breton's rented flat near Pigalle, in the north=20=

of Paris, where the surrealist manifesto was drawn up in 1924.

Since the poet's death in 1966, at the age of 70, the flat has been=20
preserved along with thousands of artworks, photographs, a collection=20
of primitive art and personal souvenirs.

Led by intellectuals including the philosopher Jacques Derrida,=20
protesters disturbed some of the sales to campaign for state=20
intervention. Even without their presence the event was often chaotic.

More than 50,000 people viewed the 6,249 lots while hundreds of=20
spectators packed the saleroom during the 21 sessions. Bidding was=20
often wild, with records set for paintings by Magritte, Miro and Arp=20
and several others when state museums stepped in to outbid private=20
buyers.

The most contested part of the sale was a collection of photographs by=20=

Man Ray and lesser known photographers.

One specialist collector, Jean-Claude Vrain, was outbid 100 times by=20
museums which spent nearly =8012m to cream off the best items.

Mr Vrain said: "I am angry because the state ignored objects connected=20=

with Breton's political activities as a faithful, anti-Stalinist=20
Trotskyist."

The biggest official buyers were the Jacques Doucet Museum in Paris,=20
where Breton left his personal letters, and the National Museum of=20
Modern Art at the Pompidou centre, which had previously acquired some=20
of Breton's artefacts as part of death duties.

Marcel Fleiss, the leading dealer in Breton mem orabilia, said the=20
auction had resurrected interest in the surrealist movement and given=20
long-delayed recognition to neglected artists.

He said: "Breton's magic has done what I haven't been able to do in 30=20=

years.

"I have been selling 90% of these artists all that time and even in my=20=

dreams I could never sell them at these prices."

The star of the sale was a portrait of Breton by Victor Brauner which,=20=

at =80180,000, fetched five times its reserve price. The painting will =
be=20
exhibited at the City of Paris Modern Art Museum.

Breton's daughter, Aube Ell=E9o=FCet-Breton, decided to sell her =
father's=20
collection two years after the death of his widow, Elisa.

i appreciate what nick lolordo is saying, given the standard media
relationship to highbrow academics... but i don't think eakin's
article constitutes merely a failed public relations gambit for the
theory wing (as it were)...

have a look at what skip gates is actually quoted as saying... or
stanley fish... these folks btw are *used to* being quoted in
newspapers... i.e., they know how to handle journalists... heck, i
saw fish e.g. on o'reilly some months back...

besides which, as i say (again, my anecdotal contribution to this
thread), i saw this coming... e.g., i had a conversation back at mla
in nyc (the day prior to our hanging out over beer and chicken wings,
nick!) in which i told a buddy of mine that this was the prevailing
attitude toward theory by the theorists i'd been bumping into...
viz., not simply that we ought to be skeptical of the conceptual
purchase we obtain through theory (fine, ok), but that theory itself
was something one can be paid to do (write) and to teach (well,
sorta!) w/o in any sense committing to its provocations... read that

they were talking to wielded this kind of institutional power (a
testament to the efficacy of journalism?)---which is to say, if they
understood just how fraught the situation is in so many quarters of
academe, for so many of us---maybe they would have paused to consider
the ramifications of their pronouncements...

            Our Father who art in heaven
                          Stay there
              And we'll stay here on earth
             Which is sometimes so pretty
           With its mysteries of New York
                 And its mysteries of Paris
       At least as good as that of the Trinity

                    Its great wall of China

       With its good children and bad people
           With all the wonders of the world
                        Which are here
                     Simply on the earth
                    Offered to everyone
                         Strewn about
        Wondering at the wonder of themselves
                   And daring not avow it
       As a naked pretty girl dares not show herself
          With the world's outrageous misfortunes
                       Which are legion

                          With torturers
                With the masters of this world
The masters with their priests their traitors and their troops
                        With the seasons
                          With the years
        With the pretty girls and with the old bastards
          With the straw of misery rotting in the steel
                             of cannons.

Lines read at Alix-Cléo Blanchette's and Jacques Roubaud's Bridal

Alix-Cléo is joined to Jacques
and Jacques is joined to Alix-Cléo

This is a delicious coincidence
and so at this hour
both are allied and united
as are bird and branch
Aucassin and Nicolette
table and chair
science and doubt
desert and oasis
*tilia* and *quercus*
quill and tale
sunrise and sunset
absence and trace
bee and linden

It's a nice hour in June
the sun shines on Ile de la Cité
on their transistor radios dealers in used literature listen to Alessandro Scarlatti's *Sonate a quattro*
harassed tourists ascend the stairs to Sacré-Coeur
on Rue de la Huchette blue-jeaned Dutch lasses sound their banjos and binious

The entire earth stretches out around us
its unsounded oceans
its lochs, its tablelands, its channels
its hills and its tundras
its sand dune, its hidden treasures, its islands, its roadsteads,
its crude oil and its turbines
its bauxites and rare soils
its basilicas, its haunted castles, its ruined bastions
its adult scouts in hot-red raincoats that chant carols at the hours close to the sacred birth
its crescent-lensed notaries that read the late editions under old burners
its retired colonels in council at the *tabac* on Rue Saint-Louis-en-l'Ile
its carousers that exit antiquated discos and then scatter
its slant-lidded Siberians that ride across the Tuba in birch canoes
its beret-clad excursionists that assault the Ballon d'Alsace
its austere Jansenists that recite Exodus and Isaiah
its circus ballerinas balanced on their obedient steeds
its D.Litt.'s that discuss Judeo-Christian structures in Hölderlin's discourse
its obese Irish chars that collect salted dills and beer (in cans) in a Bronx delicatessen

Here blue surrounds the sun, or soon shall
Let's abandon the era's raucousness
     tornadoes and clouds
Let's listen to the linnet's tune
to the cat stretched out in the den next to Bescherelle's *Dictionnaire*
quiet quotidian sounds
the heart's beat

These occasional lines
that do not concern
either carious teeth
or roots that clutch
or the author etherised on a table
or the *Coccinella cardinalis*
or the 1848 Constitution
are here inscribed to usher in this betrothal

Let decades rich in elation and delectation
bless Alix-Cléo and Jacques
those here saluted
and let there arise in the east
     a sable jet salute: childhood
and in the south
     a turquoise blue salute: adulthood
and next
     non-existence's ochre abalone salute
     that cannot be calculated or uttered
and in the north
     an alabaster seashell salute: the Resurrection

and let the Southern Cross salute Alix-Cléo and Jacques
and the star that heralds the sunset
and all the constellations
and all the nebulae

and that as sunrise starts
at the hour that bleaches the surround
both stride quite around the earth's bounds and the stars.

Stanley Fish, in any case, has been quite clear about his view that the
role of the academy is to *teach*, not to form or express political
opinion (I'd love to hear his definition of teaching; well, on second
thoughts I wouldn't; and I don't think it would actually be possible to
engage in dialogue with him, I tried once).  In his columns in the
Chronicle of Higher Education, he makes no bones about the close
relationship between the academy and *money* though he
resists the implications of this: the academy must do anything necessary
(including exploiting workers) to continue to offer the gifts of the
academy to those who can afford it.  It's the sort of self-perpetuating
nonsense that prevails in the academy and in America, too often: you can
have tenure as long as you're too exhausted, played out, and implicated
to invoke its protection, we have free speech as long as we don't use
it, we must desist from free speech in order to show solidarity with our
soldiers fighting for the rights of others to have free speech...  Well,
the academy is not some bleeping R2D2 stuffed with money dribbling what
Stanley Fish calls academic virtues all round its manic circuitry.  It's
an organic, albeit sometimes arthritic, component of our economy,
saturating/soaking (and silencing?)a sizeable proportion of "American
youth": it *matters*.
And forgive me all, I'm not an American citizen, though my grandparents
were and I am dependent on its economy and alive in its cultures.

i appreciate what nick lolordo is saying, given the standard media
relationship to highbrow academics... but i don't think eakin's
article constitutes merely a failed public relations gambit for the
theory wing (as it were)...

have a look at what skip gates is actually quoted as saying... or
stanley fish... these folks btw are *used to* being quoted in
newspapers... i.e., they know how to handle journalists... heck, i
saw fish e.g. on o'reilly some months back...

besides which, as i say (again, my anecdotal contribution to this
thread), i saw this coming... e.g., i had a conversation back at mla
in nyc (the day prior to our hanging out over beer and chicken wings,
nick!) in which i told a buddy of mine that this was the prevailing
attitude toward theory by the theorists i'd been bumping into...
viz., not simply that we ought to be skeptical of the conceptual
purchase we obtain through theory (fine, ok), but that theory itself
was something one can be paid to do (write) and to teach (well,
sorta!) w/o in any sense committing to its provocations... read that
latter clause over...

in short, that theory is just a game... the top-ranked theorists
might not cop to this, quite, but those who don't share the limelight
may... in fact, the more extreme version of this attitude---and i'm

Before we get too much further into the muck of abstractionism and the
gnarly minutiae of academia and its endless discontents, can somebody tell
me on a basic level what is theory, and how does it differ from, say,
thinking? Isn't theory merely all that which hasn't yet become fully a form
of practice? It seems to me that to talk of an end to theory is as silly as
to talk of an end to thinking itself. I suppose some conservatives would
like this to happen very much, making America into a nation of docile
assembly line drones and compliant cannon fodder, which is why the idea
appeals to them, now that they are within striking distance of taking the
world by fist and fury. But theory and thinking and politics and imagination
are all one and the same, it seems to me. What makes it go off the track is
when theory is divorced from practice and action, which, so I hear, is a
common academic affliction. But theorizing poets and practicing theorists
should know better than this, much better.

Sorry to hear about your second tenure denial, Joe.  Academia remains one of
the few places in the U.S. where chicken fights are legal.

RE:  this theory, yay or nay, quibble.  There is no escape from theory.  When
exactly have we been free of it?  Whatever mode of inscription we practice,
the scribble opens itself to one theory or another.  Seems the resistance is
to explanatory systems and methodologies that involve indeterminacy, not to
theory per se.  When it was Aristotle to Coleridge there was barely a peep.
Indeterminacy, however, interrogates hierarchies (values), and that ain't
good for business (the corporate model now dominates the university system).
Much as the uncertainty principle threatens the intelligibility of the
universe, deconstruction et al undermines the unfettered transmission of
certain values within the humanities.  That many of these theories come from
France--well, given the current state of affairs . . .

Anyway, such resistance is of course political, and nothing new.  Anti-int
ellectualism?  Most certainly.  I have a physicist friend whose work involves
subatomic particle/waves--you know, the atomic geography where the rational
world breaks down.  A few years ago he was fully funded via government
grants.  Now the well has dried up.  Seems the work just isn't "practical"
enough.  What, after all, is produced?  So it goes.  Best, Bill

mark, i *do* think that theory can be impenetrable, esp. in the hands
(reading or writing) of lesser mortals (like me)... at the same time,
theory is there for theoretically inclined minds, whether the theory
is for physicists or for litcritters... i don't have a problem with
the latter, in itself, and i'm not sure why anyone would... i also
don't have a problem with undergrads in english learning this
discourse, phoneme by phoneme... i might have a problem with the idea
that, as a poet, i have nothing necessarily to do with theory...
there's just too much work out there at this point, under the theory
rubric, for any self-respecting writer to dismiss it out of hand...

or so i would aver...

but first, to repeat what bill austin just wrote, in so many words:
theory and thought don't, can't end... but as mairead was arguing,
they can certainly be curtailed... in short, and to answer mwp, there
are institutional repercussions to the sort of publicity that ~times~
piece generates... it adds fuel to certain fires, and extinguishes
others... of course the immediate effect is felt at the institution
of origin---academe... "theory" in academe, in english depts., can
mean something very specific, in instutional terms---it does not
equate with thought... not that it couldn't---but the problem is,
again, that many of those who would claim the anti-theory posture
will insist that they're still thinking, when in reality and upon
closer examination their capacity for critical reflection kicked it a
long, long time ago...

you'll just have to trust me on this...

naturally, most of what happens in academe eventually leeches out
into the wider culture (much as today we deconstruct tom, dick, and
harry)...

now the anti-jargon argument has some legitimacy, in that we've all
witnessed theoretical devices deployed (ha), whether consciously or
less so, so as to inhibit understanding... there are poor writers, in
any mode... but lurking here, too, may perhaps be the question of
outlets for such writing---i for one would favor more of the kind of
in-between journals umberto eco once talked about as all but absent
on the u.s. scene (see his ~travels in hyperreality~)... i.e.,
journals that aren't for specialists, but aren't for ~ny times~
readers, either... the web has answered to this demand, but not
entirely...

but let me return to this question of jargon:  when foucault's work
started gaining in popularity, much was made by some of how
"difficult" he was to understand (in translation, mind you)...
personally, i find foucault easier to follow these days than, say,
plato... specifically, an essay like "what is an author?" strikes me
as the epitome of lucidity (i also find that essay endlessly
valuable)... some theorists, like derrida, continue to be tough reads
(for me anyway), but i've a much better sense of what they're about
if only b/c i've danced with their ideas, and diluted versions of
their ideas, for so long, much as the sex pistols sound rather
melodious to my ears these days...

which is another way of saying, that we ought at least to allow that
some things take some getting used to, and that even if we have a
responsibility (i say if) to articulate ourselves at times so that
most all literate beings can understand us, we probably ought to
forgo the dream of a common language, or lingo... as i address this
sentiment to poets, i can't imagine that anyone would strenuously
disagree, for if there's a set of word-practices that habitually
inhabit the non-communicative regions of language, or threaten to do
so, it's poetry... in fact, in this sense, poetry certainly trumps
theory...

out for the day///

best,

joe

Hey, Joe, I understood that the Times piece had a political content, but I
also know--I think I was talking about--ways in which some academic
theorists have made themselves vulnerable.

And I'll add that many of those who would claim a theory posture will
insist that they're still thinking, when in reality and upon
closer examination their capacity for critical reflection kicked it a long,
long time ago...you'll just have to trust me on this.

The ideas, as far as I've understood them, are often elegant but not
particularly difficult (and some terms, like deconstruction, merely name
activities that have been common forever). I suspect that there are
political motivations in the difficulty of the lingo--a clerical language.

The analogy with physics simply doesn't work--physics uses a different
language because the common tongue can't handle the concepts. Very little
critical theory is so burdened.

As to politics, it's good to remember that a lot of academics were openly,
without the shield of jargon--before the current jargon existed--marxists
when it was far more dangerous to be so, and paid the price.

Jargon is of course to a degree inevitable. Using it wholesale when there
are alternatives is just lazy. I'm proposing a sort of Occam's razor
applied to language.

matter...

"Litcritters"--

Of course theory matters, is wed to the material practices and aspects of
life and is essential to material being. Reason to be grateful for irony in
this is that even theory in all its guises of arrogance can't take away the
everyday relation of theory to practice.  To be shamelessly reductionist:
when the cat keeps track of the mouse from the window, or for that matter,
keeps rack of another cat, then the cat is strategizing, thus employing a
form of theorizing: thinking about how to deploy or act before (or after
works too) acting. The mouse reciprocates in its way, too.  The problem with
that analogy, as theory also reminds us, is that hierarchical animal
relationships--food chains and all that--are far more limited than what
humans can make available for human community (to cast it in a shamelessly
optimistic perspective)by recognizing and rethinking the relation between
theory and practice.  In that sense, it is outrageous that the NYTimes and
Skip Gates or St.Fish pass theory off as immaterial (literally + figurally),
but it's part of the theater that theory also is: play, as well as work, and
all that.

Thanks, Joe Amato: no fight here.  Yes, there are "useful" bits of language
phrasing from theory all over my ways of speaking and positions of
enunciation. One cannot escape this, as someone has pointed out, and
especially not after immersion in academics.  But more telling and
symptomatic is immersion in high literacy, I think, which can occur without
the formal academic kinds.  Reading and writing are radical actions in all
ways.  That's why poetry matters so much.

My point is that one reason the stream of theory-speak--who speaks?-who
listens?-who cares? & etc--is "useful" is that it is easily recognized and
accessible phrasing. It has a kind of currency akin to street-cred. If you
come to theory at college level from discourse areas where theory is seen as
mystifying and useless, then you can understand it's utility and economies
immediately if you identify through that line of questioning. It's a matter
of translating, radically, from one discourse to another.  There's a certain
agency in that, though its use, too, is contentious. From that perspective,
the idea of theory as related to practice can *really* matter to you, make
you want to find out what the academics doing theory are up to.  That's how
it happened to me, anyway.

"Poor writers" may be misleading.  More like "poor writing," literally,
impoverished due to lack of input. To my mind this would be lack of enough
commonality and plain old bear grease to keep the translation effective.
This, I'm sure you know, in literacy theory would be a writer in need of
reciprocal relationships with other thinkers/writers, and the varieties of
available discourses.  There is a long standing hierarchy of reference to
writers/writing, I want to point out, that draws a line between "high" and
"low" rhetorics: street vs hoi poloi ways of saying stuff.  This, too, has
to do with power relations and how reciprocity occurs as translation--more
accurately, transaction though without the capitalistic connotation if we
can imagine such (we may not be able to)--between differing folks and
communities.

This is way too long.  Thanks.  One more thing: Mark Weiss, on "jargon"
yeah, what a pain jargon is when we read student work, sure.  But there is a
certain kind of allure there, one poets can work in easier than can any
other functionary of writing (ugh! what awful phrasing that is).  In
theory's jargon is music and poetics mixed, heady, ripe as future peaches.
Play, to overturn each hegemonic arrogance, then.

keep on, all.

(Gothic News Service, 04/20) Easter Morning at the SUV, Solar and Oak Grove
Ranch Near Crawford

Easter morning, drivers along Highway 185 in Texas  - the one that leads
right by the President=B9s White House in Crawford =AD found themselves treated
to a brand new roadside attraction.  Five SUVs =AD each one from a different
manufacturer - are spaced 10 feet apart and stuck nose first at 65-degree
angles into the earth. Only the back side doors, windows and rear ends
remain revealed, each of the vehicle=B9s alternatively royal blue,
butterscotch gold, white, and cherry red colors oddly glowing like fresh
spring growth in the face of the rising sun..

More curiously, on a small northern pathway from the SUV vista stop =AD on
what is normally an arid, some say Biblical landscape =AD is the emergence of
a large, circular Oak Grove that includes picnic tables at the open center
and several winding paths into private alcoves with small benches under the
awnings of the robust trees. Perhaps equally spectacular, extending out for
several acres behind the SUV spectacle, are the parallel, reflective solar
energy panels that rotate at different angles to best catch the sun=B9s rays
at different points of the day. Visitors are welcome to pedal the site=B9s
free bicycles up and down paths that extend in several directions across th=
e
horizon.

In the roadside parking area =AD on a stand shaped out of SUV hood =AD a small
brochure printed on recycled paper provides some information about the site=
:
=85 The solar panels steel rotational supports are one hundred per cent
constructed from shredded SUV metal. Granulated glass and shredded syntheti=
c
upholstery units constitute the reflective material and chemical agents
required to produce solar energy.
=85 Bicycle frames, wheels and gears are also created from recycled SUVs. One
SUV will create 1000 bicycle frames and parts.
=85 Individuals and families are welcome to donate their SUVs to the Ranch
Recycling Center located at Crawford town limits. Free van transportation t=
o
your destination and back home is provided to donors.
=85 Under the auspices of Solar Utility Vendor Inc. (SUV Inc.) the company
provides energy through out Texas and adjoining states for community
electrical, fuel and heating systems.
Easter Morning featured an egg hunt in the Grove with both adults and
children fanning out across the paths to find blue, red, gold, and green
eggs in and around the trees. Each egg also bore a stencil printed "RECYCLE=
"
message. Egg shell waste cans were set up at the exit with fresh painted
advice,  "Partake of  the egg and recycle as you wish.  Shells hells conver=
t
to biodegradable plastic for practical use."
Houston art critics have been quick to claim the new site=B9s significance.
"This is a great contemporary re-interpretation of the both practical and
sublime use of the traditional religious shrine," one said.  "It=B9s a magica=
l
combination of high-tech modern materials used to produce both illumination
and power co-leveraged with the Oak;s healing, restive and regenerative
power. Joseph Beuys, the German artist who planted trees, and the Texas Ant
Farm=B9s Cadillac Ranch are influences here =AD but SUV Inc.=B9s commitment to
recycling, non-fossil fuel commitment, and implicit reverence for nature as
a human partner is a clear artistic step forward to community, national and
world health."

The Crawford White House refused to publicly comment on the value of the
site other than to express its concerns about either pagan religious and/or
terrorist uses. It is also not known whether the President=B9s ranch will buy
into SUV Inc.=B9s solar power unit. At last look, on Easter morning, families
were stopping =AD many in SUVS - to join in the egg hunt, picnic and quietly
contemplate on Grove benches while man took advantage of bikes to pedal
towards the horizon on the special paths between the illuminated panels.

This item Stephen posted suggests new horizons in recycling,
as did an NHK item on NWI yesterday. Apparently, there's
a Japanese company that recycles broken and splintered baseball
bats made of Japanese ash into chopsticks. The same NHK program
showed how rubblized concrete can be used to good advantage
in rooftop gardens. Note too how Pres. Bush is recycling members
of his dad's administration. Compost anyone?

The day before the article appeared in the NY Times there was the review of
"Empire" -- and another appeared the next day in the Sunday Book Review --
a book which argues that the British empire did much good, and the US
should learn from it.  Paul Berman received major reviews for his version
of liberal imperialism in the guise of anti-totalitarianism just days
before.  About 10 years ago, soon after the Somalia debacle, articles and
books began to appear which sought to restore the good name of colonialism
and empire; now "empire" and "imperialism" and "colonialism" are no longer
terms considered to be "leftist rhetoric" but part of general discourse.

I am not sure about the intellectuals at the meeting reported on in the
article -- and what really transpired -- but the reporting itself seems to
be in line with certain trends in the NY Times and other media:
oppositional intellectuals, particularly academic ones, are ridiculous
simply for attempting to be oppositional (while theorists who reinforce
current power assumptions are praised, such as Bernard Lewis or Harold
Bloom).  Now, there have been excesses in certain circles: jargon;
arrogance associated with cushy jobs; fadishness; presumption that literary
analysis is identical to social analysis or that theory itself is
praxis.  But I do not think that is what is at the root of NY Times'
disparagement.  In addition to typical American anti-intellectual
attitudes, I would suggest that there are also many people that would like
to discredit "theory" if it is oppositional and to pass off "theories" as
non theories (or as merely pragmatic realism) if they support imperial
interests or the status quo.  In response, I have a few thoughts:

We need theory more than ever, particularly social and economic theories
that can help explain the operations of globalization and world
empire.  Such theories will have a component that affects the way we think
about producing literature, analyzing literature, and examining all kinds
of cultural phenomenon.

Whoever may have thought that theory was the exclusive province of
universities was deluded -- but anyone who thinks that theory is not
produced in universities is also deluded.

Anyone with a critical sensibility can see that the world is in a lot of
trouble.

Get to work.

Here's a little nugget, Lucy:
"Item 65. Sept. 11, 2001 - For 50 minutes, from 8:15 AM until 9:05 AM, with
it widely known within the FAA and the military that four planes have been
simultaneously hijacked and taken off course, no one notifies the President
of the United States. It is not until 9:30 that any Air Force planes are
scrambled to intercept, but by then it is too late. This means that the
National Command Authority waited for 75 minutes before scrambling
aircraft, even though it was known that four simultaneous hijackings had
occurred. [Source: CNN; ABC; MSNBC; Los Angeles Times; The New York Times;

There seem to be arguments here for a new journal, maybe called _ACADEMIC
JARGON (a trifle more incisive than the NYTimes) online and in print but not
paid for by a university publisher.  I can see hundreds from the list
contributing and none buying.

Yes, it seems the rise of the Theory Contras!
It seems a bit of piling on of humiliation after the "successful liberation
of Iraq."  The liberation "from what" is easily persuasive, no matter how
pursued, if the focus remains on Hussein; the "for liberation what" agendas
and the theories and folks that drive those theories into practice are the
ones that I think are driving many of us crazy. "Retro-colonial Romancing
the Mideast" - replete with  Pilgrim Progress novels - appear to prefigure
this Administration's public imagination of the immediate future while, at
the same time, an Occupation reality that will feature - when threatened by
religious, ethnic or political opposition - Israeli military style controls
as in Palestine, only this time it is the US Military. Simultaneously,
offering more US military protection, will be the creation of entirely
insular Oil well and Refinery communities, similar to those of Chevron and
Shell in the Nigeria Delta region "to protect the flow of oil".   Bleak.
Bleak.

I think what I am experiencing - and perhaps this is shared by others(?) -
is the desire of this Administration not only to re-enforce the humiliation
of the Arabs - making all the nation's and peoples line up and behave "or
else" - but to extend that same momentum to the Peace Movement. They are
trying to take full advantage right now to neuter, silence (i.e. terrorize
and humiliate) the world and domestic opposition.

As I believe Hilton suggests, much to do, including thinking in a reactiony
time that appears to already have fateful consequences on our daily lives.
And not lose, but to reconstitute the aims and momentum of opposition so
strong before this invasion.

Happy Rabbit Day, pull a leg hard, etc.,

A clean vowel

With rational syllables
I'm trying to clear the occult mind
and promiscuous violence.
My linguistic protest

Of course, theories don't kill people; people smack pupils with Kristol and
Bennett and Adelman texts; then pistils and patriots kill people.

Yes indeed, in response to Mairead's post, especially  "second thought--and
this *is* considered--is that these people have little idea what it is not
to matter. Any bunch of inmates in United States prisons knows what it is to
not matter. Even I, who have only some contact with prisoners--and the
heroic struggle of one individual prisoner to *do good* beyond the walls,
capacities, and reach of his situation--have an inkling of what not
mattering means. Plunge into poverty and you also find what it is not to
matter."  I can personally attest to what it feels like to lose one's entire
life savings in the stock market, largely (if not completely) from a stock
Bush's pappy cashed in for $14 million (on shares given to him for a couple
of half-day speaking engagements), DNC chair Terry McAuliffe cashed in for
$18 million (from same, speaking engagements, as I recall), and the average
investor and pension holder (in the case of employees, locked out of selling
their shares), sans any winks from insiders about a good time to sell, were
left holding the bag.

Or maybe: "Theories don't matter; people do."  Smiles.  But seriously, they
do indeed matter.  That's why the Right uses might to foreground their own
pathetic tomes and elevate their weak buffoons to "authors" and "think tank
experts."  Same as trying to supplant "evolution theory" with so-called
"Creationist science."   And then, say you're an Adjunct someplace, at a
community college, say, and you engage students there with No, not quite
Benjamin and Adorno, but just plain Darwin, and the students are not
terribly sophisticated, ditto the administrator who calls you in one day
cause Christian Kid X or Christian Kid Y complained, and you have no job
security, 'cause you got no tenure, so maybe you can stick some Foucault or
Fish or Jameson, Frederick up the administrator's, umm, nose, and ask
politely, "Wanna catch a whiff of this," and the administrator's a former
Dept. Head in that department of Impossibility...  Okay, I'll stop...

OT: Petroskey, the Baseball Hall of Fame dork, (had to) come out and give
Robbins and Sarandon and Baseball an apology, today.  Well, that's cool.
Ultimately, the whole lot of them are going to go down in Shame.  Well,
that's my prediction.  Or maybe it's a mission.  Anyways...  :))

Humanity Belief in Goodness


Humanity Belief in Goodness will bring all of us into an untimely end as
no one will agree with one what Goodness is or even Belief. I think
Goodness is not hurting but what if one in Humanity is hurting me. I think
we are all in Humanity. Everyone will want to be Good but sometime we
forget we want to be Good and then there are problems. What do we do then.
I think I agree that Mr. Hussein forgot to do Good but when he would think
he would laugh but sometime he would think about being Good. Mr. Bush
thinks all the time I am doing Good and has his Belief. Mr. Hitler from
long ago thinks all the time I am doing Good but he would not eat meat.
Mr. Bush will eat meat. I do not think it is Good to eat meat because I do

That is true. But the island is not near Vancouver. Not unless you
would say that Rhode Island is near Georgia.

very good!
but this is written in clear English.

it's true, some things are too difficult to be gotten
at directly. i like ideas that are subtle as much as
anyone. i just haven't found them in the critical darlings

This is a link to a story on that shady religious
group that I mentioned in one of the Nader posts
(I called it "The Family," but it's actually
called "The Fellowship" -- even creepier). There's

reading with Elaine Equi at 8pm at the Poetry Project of St. Mark's Church.

Commens on Guest's Forces of Imagination:

We expect poets to give a first-hand account of what poetry is. But some=20
poets, when they write criticism, produce a kind of prose that is itself on=
=20
the verge of being poetry. Val=E9ry, Stevens and Marianne Moore belong to=20
this "visionary company." And so does Barbara Guest, whose writings on=20
poetry, collected here, are among the most inspiring works of their kind.=20
It is a deep pleasure to know that such writing can still exist.  --John=20
Ashbery

Guest has earned her formidable reputation through dedication to modern=20
lyric's difficult double-project of making song think and making thought=20
sing, of stretching the very medium of conceptual thought language all the=
=20
way toward music and affect, but without relinquishing any of the rigor of=
=20
conceptual intellection. The essays, talks and addresses, and prose and=20
verse meditations now gathered in Forces of Imagination offer welcome=20
points of entry into Guest's challenging aesthetic.  --Robert Kaufman,=20
Stanford University

Writing about thinkers, poets and writers as diverse as Baudelaire,=20
Mallarm=E9, Plato, Walter Benjamin, Kant, Pasternak, Machado de Assis, H.D.,=
=20
Horace, Wallace Stevens and Pound; about radical and conservative poetics,=
=20
modernism, postmodernism, the relationship between art and poetry; about=20
the importance of imagination and surprise in poetry, Barbara Guest=20
situates herself in a multi-faceted literary landscape spanning centuries=20
and continents, at the same time providing brilliant insights into the=20
roots and workings of contemporary poetry. This is an evocative collection=
=20
of essays and poems on writing that might be quite provocative to a certain=

audience steeped in the poetics of academia. Fascinating reading for anyone=

Does anyone think that academic theory has been good for contemporary poetry?  Has theory helped poets to write originally and well?  If so, what has theory made available to poets that was not already present in the tradition?  Examples, please.

I think academic theory has been good for contemporary poetry only to the extent that theorists' patronizing attitude toward literary value has challenged poets to try to articulate why their art matters.  Unfortunately, poetry's importance is not something that poets are able to explain very convincingly in conceptual terms, is it?

The winner of the "Banner-Strike" contest was "Peace of Cake"
by Pau Waelder.

Honorable mentions go to KRN and Michael Szpakowski.

"Banner-Strike" was a joint contest held by the Banner Art Colelctive
and Opensorcery.net's Velvet Strike project.  It was a contest for
digital graffiti and net.art that was created under specific
limitations and which critically examined the war in Iraq. As the
winner, Pau will receive a copy of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero when
it is released in October. His banner will be featured at the top
of bannerart.org for one month. The 34 entries for the contest will be
turned into sprays for Counter-Strike and added to the Velvet-Strike
collection.

We would like to thank all the artists that participated in the contest.
Additionally, special thanks goes to Joan Leandre for helping judge the
competition.

Best,
Brandon Barr and Garrett Lynch

Hi y'all,

A couple of months ago I wrote to the list that we were culling a lot
of recordings, books, etc. that we've had in storage for years. We've
finally gotten through some of the poetry and prose boxes and I'm
starting to list some things on ebay.

Right now, there's a full set of Temblor 1-10; This 1-12, , Montemora
1-8, The O'blek double issue Writing from the New Coast, five special
issues of Boundary 2 (Baraka, Creeley, Olson, Spicer & the Oral
Impulse (Antin/Rothenberg et al), recordings by Basil Bunting and
John Taggart, and a long mesostic poem by John Cage (I-VI).

In coming weeks we'll be listing a complete set of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E,
VORT, lots of other issues of poetry and related critical magazines,
many anthologies, & eventually some books by individual writers.
Judging from how long it took to get through most of the new music
material we decided to sell off (we still have a month or so of that
stuff to go), I think the poetry-related auctions will be going on
through most of the summer months.

If you're interested, please check out this page:

If this link doesn't work for you, search ebay for SELLER <hrebll>.

Please tell other folks who may be interested.

Thanks a lot.

Subject:      THE LATEST THEORY  IS THAT THEORY DOESN'T MATTER
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

The insularity of continental US poetry has been a problem in terms of what
theory does for poets and poetry.  So maybe it's better to clarify
relations: where, who, what theory and what poetry?

Example: Latin American poets from all over that continental "America"
created lively,influential poetries based on input and animated thought from
what are considered--even by St.Fish?--to be schools of theory: surrealist &
ect. That's only one major example from the 20th century.

Historically there are many more of course, but mostly not coming out of the
continental US, where the nationalizing drive in poetry circles of late
nineteeth throughout the twentieth century became so focused to canon
formations--as an ultimate and highly economical act of exclusivity--as to
forget that there are many influences that go into the creation and
reception of poetic arts.  I'm thinking here of Tim Morris's *Becoming
Canonical in American Poetry*, for one explanation, though there are many
others.

(1) must read:  steve tomasula's (author) & stephen farrell's
(graphic designer) ~vas:  an opera in flatland~, just out on station
hill... it'll set you back $34, but it's worth every penny, believe
me, as it's one of THE narrative + image texts of the early 21st
century... just incredible...

(2) if you folks can get a hold of same, see ~new media:  theories
and practices of digitextuality~, ed. anna everett & john t.
caldwell, just out on routledge... yours truly has an essay therein,
in which a few listmates pop up (jeffrey jullich, brian kim stefans,
alan sondheim), but my scribblings aside, there's some asskicking
work in this volume...

My (probably inarticulate) two cents on Guest book:

It is so lovely and brilliant; and in a tradition of
"generosity" it *feeds*. And enables: finally at the
end Guest privileges "imagination" over any other
consideration in poetry. The woman's completely
inviolate, uncorruptible. She's light, she's
lantern-bearer, she would have no idea why I am saying
the things I say about her if she should read
this...Read, read, read,

Kazim.

Every library should have it.
All the poets should read it.
All the teachers should use it.
All the students should eat it.

to pick up quickly on what chris m just said, and to answer andrew:
i'm tight with steve tomasula (see ~vas~ in my prior post)... he and
i and my partner kass fleisher talk theory all the time, have for
years now... he calls himself a prose writer, not a poet, and i don't
claim any special influence on or insight into his work... but it's
clear to me how, specifically, theory has influenced ~vas~ (see
kass's review in an upcoming ~abr~)... ~vas~ is certainly a work
informed by any number of scientific theories and contemporary body
technologies (let's say)... but in terms of a poetic, sure---you
simply can't compose a work like that and not bump up against theory
and theories, from everyplace and anyplace, the academic variety
included... it's a fully theorized item, and even to say this in such
terms is to acknowledge a debt to academic theory in particular...

i want to say something like, prove academic theory is NOT at work in
helping contemporary poets to write "originally and "well"... but
this would be to prove a negative, in effect, so it's an unfair
request... so let's look at it anecdotally:  as a poet (some will
say, academic poet, sure), i can say with complete certainty that the
conversations i have on this list, about theory (etc.), help me to
write originally and well... which is why at times i simply have to
say, you'll just have to trust me... if you don't, and we disagree
(which amounts to someone telling me i'm self-deceived, of course),
there's not much either side can do but move it along, right?...

best,

joe

Dear Dr. Amit,

We have received your email with your decision not to review a paper for us
in light of American actions in the middle east. We recognize that reviewing
manuscripts is a voluntary activity, one that you perform as a service to
the physics community, and we thank you for your efforts.

Given the voluntary nature of your participation we of course respect your
decision to cease, and have made an indication in our database so that no
further papers will be sent to you for review until you inform us otherwise.

We ask, however, that you consider the following in hopes that in the not
too distant future you will decide to review for us again. We regard science
as an international enterprise and we do our best to put aside political
disagreements in the interest of furthering the pursuit of scientific
matters. We have never used other than scientific criteria in judging the
acceptability of a paper for publication, without regard to the country of
origin of the author. We have done this even in cases where some of us have
disagreed strongly with the policies of that country, and we will continue
this practice. We believe it is essential that all parties involved make
every effort to separate social and political differences from their
participation in scientific research and publication. The pursuit of
scientific knowledge needs to transcend such issues.

Sincerely,

Martin Blume
Editor-in-Chief

Dear Dr Blume, Editor in Chief American Physical Society

09.04.2003

Thank you for you letter of April 8. I would have liked to be able to share
the honorable sentiments you express in your letter as well as your optimism
in the future role of science and the scientific community. To be frank, and
with much sadness and pain, after 40 years of activity and collaboration, I
find very little reason for such optimism.

What we are watching today, I believe, is a culmination of 10-15 years of
mounting barbarism of the American culture the world over, crowned by the
achievements of science and technology as a major weapon of mass
destruction. We are witnessing man hunt and wanton killing of the type and
scale not seen since the raids on American Indian populations, by a superior
technological power of inferior culture and values. We see no corrective
force to restore the insanity, the self-righteousness and the lack of
respect for human life (civilian and military) of another race.

Science cannot stay neutral, especially after it has been so cynically used
in the hands of the inspectors to disarm a country and prepare it for
decimation by laser guided cluster bombs. No, science of the American
variety has no recourse. I, personally, cannot see myself anymore sharing a
common human community with American science.

Unfortunately, I also belong to a culture of a similar spiritual deviation
(Israel), and which seems to be equally incorrigible. In desperation I
cannot but turn my attention to other tragic periods in which major
societies, some with claims to fundamental contributions to culture and
science, have deviated so far as to be relegated to ostracism and
quarantine. At this point I think American society should be considered in
this category. I have no illusions of power, as to the scope and prospect of
my attitude. But, the minor role of my act and statement is a simple way of
affirming that in the face of a growing enormity which I consider
intolerable, I will exercise my own tiny act of disobedience to be able to
look straight into the eyes of my grandchildren and my students and say that
I did know.

With regard,

Daniel Amit

PS I intend to distribute our exchange as much as possible. I authorize and
pray that you do the same.

Islamic World Less Welcoming to American Scholars


By SAM DILLON

Elizabeth C. Stone, a professor of anthropology, had planned to spend the
summer excavating a 2,600-year-old city surrounding an ancient citadel in
eastern Turkey. But like scores of other American professors, she was forced
to cancel her trip as American tanks rumbled toward Baghdad.

The war in Iraq, and the angry reactions it has aroused across the Islamic
world, have disrupted work by American scholars from Tunisia to Pakistan.

In some cases, academic institutions or researchers themselves have canceled
trips in response to State Department warnings of danger. In other cases,
host countries have denied them study permits.

Experts say the war has caused the greatest interruption of overseas study
since World War II, forcing the cancellation or postponement of hundreds of
expeditions researching everything from Islamic law to the bone knives used
by ancient butchers.

"I can't remember when research has been disrupted across such a wide
region," said Dr. Stone, who teaches at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook. "The war has left a very wide footprint."

Many professors with long experience in the region fear it could be years
before hostilities subside enough to allow researchers from the United
States to operate overseas as they have in the past.

"Only in the best case will conditions for research ever be as good as in
the past," said Philip D. Gingerich, a University of Michigan paleontologist
who has dug for ancient whale skeletons in Pakistan since the early 1970's.
"Anti-American feelings have grown so strong in these populations that
unquestionably it will now be more dangerous to work in many areas."

This year Professor Gingerich could not get a work permit from Pakistan, and
he suspects that was because officials were unable to guarantee his safety.

In recent weeks, anger among Islamic populations has affected American
research 1,900 miles to the west of Baghdad and 1,500 miles to the east. In
Tunis and Cairo, American scholarly institutions and libraries temporarily
closed their doors; in Yemen researchers abandoned rural sites for the
safety of the capital; and in Pakistan, American scholars have been denied
research permits that were freely extended in the past.

The regional crisis has unsettled the lives of hundreds of American
academics. Some professors had sublet apartments in preparation for
expeditions that are now suspended, and graduate students expecting those
trips to yield crucial data are now having to rethink years of planning for
their dissertations.

Still, many people were reluctant to dwell on their personal misfortunes.

"We can't be too concerned about our own problems - think of the people in
Iraq who are facing catastrophes," said Tony J. Wilkinson, an associate
professor at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute who has worked
across the region studying the canals and roads of ancient civilizations.

Included in those catastrophes were the April 11 pillaging of Iraq's
National Museum and its main library. Those events horrified many scholars,
who were more keenly aware than the general public of the priceless
artifacts lost. Professor Stone and other academics now hope to enlist
graduate students whose expeditions were canceled to work on a cataloging of
items stolen from the museum to help with their recovery.

In the weeks leading to the Iraq war, the State Department warned Americans
to leave or to avoid travel to 17 countries across North Africa, the Mideast
and South Asia. The warnings cover all but three countries in the region:
Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt.

At the same time, the State Department suspended the Fulbright Program in
Kuwait, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel, which border Iraq or are within
500 miles, causing about 40 American Fulbright scholars to abandon those
countries. Last month the private group that organizes research in Jordan
for American and Canadian universities shuttered its office in Amman because
of security concerns and moved its staff to Cyprus, throwing into disarray
the plans of some 500 scholars who work in Jordan each summer.

Several professors with decades of experience in the Islamic world said that
at no time in memory, including the periods of turmoil surrounding the 1967
Six-Day War, the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the 1991 Persian Gulf war, had
so many travel warnings been in effect for so many countries in the region.
Kelly Shannon, a State Department spokesman, said she could neither confirm
nor contradict that assertion.

Although the department has issued no travel warning for Egypt,
anti-American protests outside the United States Embassy in Cairo and the
adjoining American Research Center in Egypt forced the center's closure on
March 20 and 23. The University of Pennsylvania ordered one graduate student
to return from its archaeological site at Abydos, in southern Egypt; she was
just weeks away from completing her research. Stephen P. Harvey, an
assistant professor of archaeology at the University of Chicago, canceled
his plans to spend this spring in Egypt with 10 students and colleagues
excavating monuments erected by the Pharoah Ahmose in 1500 B.C.

"In the Arab world there is a negative feeling about the U.S. that is
different than anything we felt even two years ago," Professor Harvey said.

Perhaps the most sweeping effects on American research have come in Jordan,
which until recently had offered one of the friendliest work environments.
But on Feb. 7, the State Department urged its diplomats to leave the
country, and 15 Fulbright scholars were ordered to leave as well. Pierre M.
Bikai, the Berkeley-trained director of the American Center of Oriental
Research in Amman, shut his office and moved his staff to Cyprus.

Mr. Bikai said he hoped to reopen the office but has set no date. Although
in a normal summer about 500 American scientists carry out research in
Jordan, this year he expects only a handful, he said.

Gary O. Rollefson, a professor emeritus of anthropology at Whitman College
in Washington, had planned to leave in May to begin work with colleagues at
two sites in Jordan, but he canceled plans for one site. He still hopes to
visit the second, a 13,000-year-old settlement of hunter-gatherers he
discovered last year, but he is not certain that his colleagues will
consider work in Jordan to be safe.

Most Jordanians "realize there's a difference between the Bush
administration and individual Americans who come over there," Professor
Rollefson said. "But you can't control emotions, and sometimes people just
fly off the handle."

Archaeologists from several American universities have canceled expeditions
to Syria, including Michael D. Danti, a University of Pennsylvania
researcher who in April and May was to direct excavations of 4,000-year-old
Mesopotamian structures at Tell Sweyhat, an eight-hour drive north of
Damascus.

The rise of anti-American sentiments across the region has left scholars
with sharply limited options for field research, Mr. Danti said. Recently
hopes had been rising that Iran, long closed, was opening to American
researchers, but the Iraq war has dashed them, he said.

"Turkey is touch-and-go, and Jordan is becoming more anti-American," Mr.
Danti said. "For people specializing in Near Eastern cultures, the places
where you can study are getting few and far between.

Hi all,

Sorry for the OT message, but I am searching urgently for a new place to
live in Brooklyn (Greenpoint to Carroll Gardens on the G train) or in the
Stuyvesant Town area. My lease ends May 31, and I am looking for my own
place or a possible share.

I would appreciate it if anyone on this list in NYC could contact me if you
hear of anything. My limit is $1100 in terms of rent.

Thank you very much,

Marc

In a very generalized sense, theory and thinking and philosophy and
linguistics has educated a generation of poets to the histories and
genealogies of international poetic and literary expression. Thinking has
rescued American (poetry) from its amnesia and ignorance of other poetries.
As keepers of language, it seems to me that thinking with an historical
context has restored poets and poetry (and there are exceptions) to makers
and keepers and archivists of poetic expression.  Not just of the
contemporary surfaces but of the surfaces and depths of expression over time.
 One could not,  for instance, study history without studying  the history of
history (historiography).   One needn't make poetry with the history of
poetry crowding the mind (and thus potentially quieting every phoneme--one
writes and one's mind and body might disappear for the moment.  Yet, as
Spicer says, poetry is a conversation between the dead and the living.
       There is no mandate, and what the NY Times reports is not very
relevant to writers, only professional readers of literature who are confused
now, especially perplexed as to what to think next.  As confused as the rest
of us. Perhaps this reflects our current political situation.   But we find
our balance more easily because of imaginative possibilities.   Real
academics, on the other hand, have to singularize themselves, and these are
difficult times for professional readers, when what is being produced seems
inexorably unclassifiable.  Particularly post-Language poets and writers who
curiously enough have little interest in killing off their "elders."  They
largely seem free of  Bloom's anxiety of influence.  They take and make and
try to find their own space, rather less anxiously than past generations.
       The real conundrum is the professionalization of poetry, I think, not
theory.  Even this has historical precedent.  Think of Longfellow!  Scholar
extraordinaire.  Best selling poet in America.   While Whitman was breaking
ground.  His theories were not particularly coherent, but he did have them,
and was completely aware of the history of literature.  And then he joined
the fray of the new.  But he wrote with and against theory, and became an
internationalist.

I for one wasn't questioning theory in general--theory is inevitable. I was
questioning the language of  a certain kind of theory.

As to a supposed change in poetry away from Bloom's Oedipal model, when
Bloom came out with that stuff the folks I know thought it was pretty
silly. Bloom is, after all, something of a clown.

It's easy to confuse the history of poetry with the history
of  professional ideas about the history of poetry, I guess.

When do you think  that thinking rescued American poetry? I've been around
a long time, and I don't remember the pre-thought days. If what you mean is
that certain segments of the American poetry world don't appear to think
much, I'm with you, but that's a rather different proposition.

It's useful to remember that history didn't begin with one's own consciousness.

The language of which theory?  I don't think of Bloom as a clown--just an all
too earnest, heavily weighted reader.  A bear, almost, unwilling to be
anything else.  Yet his Freudian model was of its time, and quite relevant to
its time.

It wasn't that long ago. Already very pass=E9 by then. The heyday of that=20
sort of thing really was the 20s to the 50s, late survivals into the 70s,=20
of which The Anxiety of Influence (1975, I think) was an example.

i don't mean to singe you out here, Mark, but by the "American poetry world"
don't you perhaps mean the US of A poetry world?  For quite some time the US
hegemony has extended beyond weaponry to brand names, the media, and the
academy.

For example, I couldn't get either the public library of university library
here to accept _Across the Line _ as a gift and the high schools wouldn't
take it as there are no relevant questions on the annual tests.  I did
however auction it a an off-the-mall-and-interstate Mexican restaurant with
possibly some illegals in attendance, though, so you can cash the check.

perhaps the subject line here should be THE LATEST USUNIVERSITY THEORY...?

I think your close is quite apt:

> It's useful to remember that history didn't begin with
> one's own consciousness.

but perhaps the one's own here refers to the listserv's membership as a
body?

'Marx spoke very little of communism, except for the rare occasions
on which he criticized others' discourses on the subject. He even
said somewhere that speaking of the future was itself reactionary. Up
until the climate change of 1989, I also despised all ideas of
possible futures. I believed that the struggle against capitalism and
the state would be possible without ideas of a future, and that we
should only sustain the struggle endlessly in response to each
contradiction arising from a real situation. The collapse of the
socialist bloc in 1989 compelled me to change my stance. Until then,
I, as many others, had been rebuking Marxist states and communist
parties; that criticism had unwittingly taken for granted their solid
existence and the appearance that they would endure forever. As long
as they survived, we could feel we had done something just by
negating them. When they collapsed, I realized that my critical
stance had been paradoxically relying on their being. I came to feel
that I had to state something positive.
[...]
'Marxism has been accused of being rationalist and teleological in
its attempt to realize the grand narrative. Stalinism was indeed a
consequence of this tendency: the party of intellectuals led the
populace by reason embodying the law of history, and thus the
infamous tragedy. In opposition to this, the power of reason has been
questioned, the superiority of intellectuals has been denied, and the
teleology of history negated. The reexamination of Marxism has
involved public consensus and negotiation among multiple language
games as opposed to the central control of reason, and heterogeneity
of experience or complexity of causality as opposed to a rationalist
(metaphysical) view of history; on the other hand, the present, which
has hitherto been sacrificed by telos, is reaffirmed in its
qualitative heterogeneity (or in the sense of Bergsonian duration).
I, too, was part of this vast tendency--called deconstruction, or the
archaeology of knowledge, and so on--which I realized later could
have critical impact only while Marxism actually ruled the people of
many nation-states. In the 1990s, this tendency lost its impact,
having become mostly a mere agent of the real deconstructive movement
of capitalism. Skeptical relativism, multiple language games (or
public consensus), aesthetic affirmation of the present, empirical
historicism, appreciation of subcultures (or cultural studies), etc.,
lost their most subversive potencies and hence became the dominant,
ruling thought. Today, these have become official doctrine in the
most conservative institutions in economically advanced
nation-states. All in all, this tendency can be summarized as the
appreciation of empiricism (including aestheticism) against
rationalism. In this sense, it has become increasingly clear that the
return to Kant in recent years has actually been a return to Hume.

'Meanwhile, it was in the effort of going beyond the empiricist
tendency--as a critique of Hume--that I began to read Kant. This, to
state it outright, is a project to reconstruct the metaphysics called
communism. It was Kant who provided the most lucid insight into
metaphysics' proper role and the inseparable and inevitable tie
between faith and reason. "Thus I had to deny knowledge in order to
make room for faith; and the dogmatism of metaphysics, i.e., the
prejudice that without criticism reason can make progress in
metaphysics, is the true source of all unbelief conflicting with
morality, which unbelief is always very dogmatic."  With this
statement, it is not that Kant sought to recover religion per se;
what he affirmed was the aspect of religion that tends toward
morality, encouraging us to be moral.

'In contradistinction from mainstream Marxists, Marx persistently
refused to consider communism as "constitutive idea (or constitutive
use of reason)" in Kant's sense, and he rarely spoke of the future.
Thus in The German Ideology, Marx made an addition to the text
written by Engels: "Communism for us is not a state of affairs which
is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust
itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the
present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from
the now existing premise."  Therefore, the dogmatization of communism
as a "scientific socialism" was much the kind of metaphysics Marx
refuted. But this is not contradictory to the fact that he nurtured
communism as "regulative idea (regulative use of reason)." So the
young Marx stressed the categorical imperative: "The criticism of
religion ends with the teaching that man is the highest being for
man, hence with the categorical imperative to overthrow all relations
in which man is a debased, enslaved, forsaken, despicable being."
For him, communism was a Kantian categorical imperative, that is,
practical and moral par excellence. He maintained this stance his
whole life, though later he concentrated his efforts on the
theoretical search for the historico-material conditions that would
enable the categorical imperative to be realized. Meanwhile, the
mainstream Marxists, having derided morality and advocated
"historical necessity" and "scientific socialism," ended up
constituting a new type of slave society. This was nothing short of
what Kant called "all pretensions of reason in general [aller
Anmaþungen der Vernunft ¸berhaupt]." Distrust of communism has
spread, and the responsibility for "the true source of all unbelief"
lies with dogmatic Marxism. We cannot and should not forget the
miseries of the 20th century caused by communism, and neither should
we take this mistake simply as misfortune. From that juncture onward
we have not been allowed to advocate "Idea" of any kind--not even of
the New Left, which came into existence by negating Stalinism--with a
naive positivity. That is why "in accordance with the fashion of the
age, [communism] proves despised on all ideas." Yet at the same time,
other kinds of dogmatism are flourishing in various costumes.
Furthermore, while intellectuals of advanced nations have been
expressing their distrust of morality, various kinds of religious
fundamentalism have begun to gain strength all over the world, and
the intellectuals cannot simply scorn them.

'For these reasons, beginning in the 1990s, my stance, if not my
thinking itself, changed fundamentally. I came to believe that theory
should not remain in the critical scrutiny of the status quo, but
should propose something positive to change the reality. At the same
time, I reconfirmed the difficult of doing so. Social democracy to me
would not offer any promising prospect, and it was finally around the
turn of the new century that I began to see a ray of hope that led me
to organize the New Associationist Movement (NAM) in Japan. Certainly
innumerable real movements that seek to abolish the status quo are
occurring in all corners of the world, inevitably, under the
procession of the globalization of world capitalism. But, in order to
avoid the repetition of bygone mistakes, I insist that a
transcritical recognition is necessary.'

I've just seen some discussion on an electronic music-related list
about whether the term "3rd coast" has been used for the Gulf Coast
more or longer than it has been used for the Great Lakes. I seemed to
recall from when I was at UW Madison in the 70s that there was a
poetry magazine or something further east within the midwest called
the 3rd coast.

Does anyone out there in poetics land (Luigi Drake, Tom Beckett, some
one I'm not thinking of) have any memory/knowledge/fantasies about
this?

Bests,

Herb,

In 1976 Wayne State University Press published an anthology of
"contemporary Michigan poetry" titled _The Third Coast_. Edited by Conrad
Hilberry, Herbert Scott, and James Tipton. Someone gave me a copy at the
time. I've probably done little more than thumb through it.

I think academic theory has been good for contemporary poetry only to the
extent that theorists' patronizing attitude toward literary value has
challenged poets to try to articulate why their art matters.  Unfortunately,
poetry's importance is not something that poets are able to explain very
convincingly in conceptual terms, is it?

Andy >>

Hi Andy.  Your question is just a tad loaded--e.g., "patronizing attitude."
Where's the evidence for this?  Perhaps you are referring to the various
camps within the pobiz and the conflicts between them.  In that case, "All
are punished."

But that aside, whether or not this or that theory is good for poetry is,
well, "academic."
There always has, and always be theory.  (What, by the way, differentiates
academic from nonacademic theory?)  Coleridge was an academic.  His theory
seems to have done well by 19th century poetry, and beyond.  Various
theories--literary, scientific, psychological--have influenced the writing of
poetry and prose, painting, film.  Consider what the 20th century novel owes
to Freud, as just one example.  T.S. Eliot's poetry owes an enormous debt to
the philosophy of F.H. Bradley.  All of these "theories" were polished within
academia.  The simplest lyric poem is rooted in Romantic theory.

Most, if not all, contemporary theories which attach themselves to art found
their inspiration in Continental language philosophy.  Those academics did
nothing with language that quantum physicists (academics all) hadn't already
done with the "material" universe, i.e., expose the uncertainty which haunts
the core of things.  Maybe we should blame Heisenberg.  All I'm saying is
that all this is inevitable.  New poetic methodologies give rise to new
theory, and vice versa.  It has always been thus.  New discoveries influence
a range of activities.  One has a choice:  accept or deny, expose or censure.

One may argue that if a different system dominated the theoretical landscape,
a more accessible poetry would result.  One may also argue that if more
people read poetry, theory would be more accommodating to the masses.  Like
any circle, the end point is also the starting point.  No escape from this
conundrum.

As for poets not well explaining the importance of their craft--I don't think
that's true.  Romanticism from Blake to Williams has always held that poetry
is the original language, rather than an affectation.  It exercises modes of
thinking and feeling that some argue have been slowly lost in the industrial
and technological ages.  Do poets and poetry convince?  Convince whom?
Perhaps it merely has to be there to exercise an influence.  Perhaps--much as
any "primitive" culture steeped in mystery, or any non-rational activity on
the fringe, it infects our values, repels all efforts to completely banish
it, by virtue of its irreconcilable foreignness, otherness.  Sounds to me a
serious resistance that's both conceptual (theoretical) and practical.

Anyway, we all know our tastes.  Perhaps that's as far as we can go with
this.  Spoken word is popular.  It sells tickets.  Language poetry finds most
of its audience in the academy.  And the conventional lyric poem remains an
important player.  It's all there.  Contemporary poetry is a fucking
supermarket of forms.

Has theory been good for contemporary poetry?  Well, it hasn't killed
anything.  How bad can it be?  Best, Bill

There was also an anthology of short fiction by Michigan writers entitled The Third Coast published by Wayne State Press in 1982.

Jim Harrison and Charles Baxter had a stories in it. My dad had a story in it, and I went to the reception for it, with my dad, when I was 13 years old.

I'll never forget, Jim Harrison looked about 10 feet tall to me; he was wearing jodphers (sp?); smoking a cigar; and laughing from deep in his belly. That image of him has made me smile for years.

i'm particularly interested in Suggestion #3:

3. It has been suggested that the major challenge for the humanities in
the coming century will be to determine the fate of literature and to
secure some space for the aesthetic in the face of the overwhelming
forces of mass culture and commercial entertainment. True?

good to know that the "fate of literature" lies in such capable hands

Theory has been crucial to my work for at least the past twenty years. It
was Barthes, Derrida, Deleuze, Ulmer, and a host of others that made writing
inventive, thus possible, to me again, after I had given up on the Literary
World and returned to sculpting. I still look to theorists to help me
negotiate the shallows; and, like bodhisattvas, they still appear, if you
look for them. Theorists like Alan Bourassa, for example, suddenly pop up.

As for poetry's importance. As long as language is important, poetry will
naturally be at the helm.

Perhaps what is meant by the "end" of theory is that science is finally
encroaching into the realm of the humanities and taking over, just as it
took over religion decades ago and basically made God irrelevant to any but
the holdouts (admittedly still in the billions) who still need faith to
govern their lives. For me, the innovations of brain science, for instance,
and what it reveals about how language works are far more interesting and
useful than anybody's literary "theory" of language. There is still a long,
long way to go with brain science, of course, but I think more new ideas of
how to make cutting-edge poetry will emerge from what we learn about the
biological functioning of the brain than from somebody revising Derrida or
Bloom.

(You may take this as a provocation if you like, as I am not sure how
willing I am to support such claims. It came to me more a "toss it out there
and see what sticks" kind of view.)

Isn't poetry cultish?  Seems it's always been so.  Much of the language that
language philosophers use was either well established, or in the process of
becoming well established since referential (correspondent) linguistics began
its nosedive in the late 19th century.  Certainly Saussure provided much of
the lexicon long before structuralists/poststructuralists got their feet wet,
even if it found open air only a little at a time.  The same might be said of
Freud and Einstein, though here we may end up quibbling over degrees of
belatedness.  I'll leave alone "science fiction" and "extraordinary."  Can't
argue with reductions or adjectives.


<<What's involved in the present case is very different, I think, frfom a

philosopher limiting the meaning of a common word (and being very clear

about what he means by the term) so that he can discuss a limited concept

without confusion. In the case at hand very few of the concepts are new or

particularly difficult to grasp.>>

Yes, I do see your point.  There are no new ideas.  The Greeks had it
covered, one way or another.  Perhaps all we can say is that it's becoming so
much more difficult, and maximalist, and non-rational.  "Economy" is
certainly lost at the quantum level.  More generally we seem fated to contend
with the uncertainly of subject/object, of formulae, of language, of cultural
definition--this is where the intellect has taken us.  Of course, we can
refuse to go.  Language is surely capable of providing all the provisionals
we like.


<<Why don't we all learn latin?>>

Good idea.  Very good idea.  And let's add to the list Spanish, Italian,
French, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew et al so we Americans can at least understand
what the rest of the world is, and was, saying.

<<But I don't want to get too far off track. What I'm really saying is a

paraphrase of Olson: critics have to write as well as poets. Resorting to a

clerical language is more often than not an evasion of that piece of hard
work.>>

I like Olson.  A lot.  His fudging of the line between form and content is
worthy theoretical support for many postmodern poets and theorists (try
Baudrillard).  Olson did it himself in Maximus, though it was all in the
early stages then:  fragmentation's assault on linearity and the unified
subject; his reminding us of the Otherness of natural/pre-historic objects
(e.g., the breath) over the abstractions of "high culture."  And, of course,
some critics do  write as well as some poets; some better.  If there are no
new ideas, then how a critic or poet transmits ideas becomes the most
interesting aspect of the work, right?  That's the art part.  No?  Maybe.  I
guess.  Anyway, I enjoy the challenge.

The criticism you reference may at times amount to an evasion, at times not.
One kind of writing assumes an object without it, one that can be
represented, analyzed; another kind doesn't.  The latter flies off the
principle that all objects (for us) are linguistic, i.e., all knowledge is.
Beyond language lies only the irreconcilable, incomprehensible Other.  And
even that remark is meaningful only as a linguistic event.

You're aware, I'm sure, that Girard is more in the phenomenological mode than
the deconstructive.  He had his problems also with Derrida and company.  But
I believe you.  Believe me that in the 80s there was plenty of resistance to
those deconstruction guys.  Note the battles between Searle, Derrida and
between their respective followers.  I was just starting my academic career
in the 80s, and I got an earful.  Later, at SUNY, there was resistance to my
joining the faculty precisely because of my writing in the deconstructive
"vein" (imagine that!).  Can't speak for your experience, of course.

This sounds to me much more like the debates at mid-century and occasional
explanations of the New Criticism -- and I certainly don't see how science
and theory are here opposed -- there is, after all, the philosophy of
science, which takes as a part of its task the anatomizing of scientific
theorizing --

the NYT article certainly had less to do with any actual death or
diminution of theory than with on-going battles for dominance within the
humanities -- as any number have here pointed out, it's not as if those
pronouncing the death of theory don't advance as forcefully as they can any
number of theories of their own --

as for what theory may have done for make literary art "better," -- I can't
speak for others, but I remain grateful to Whitman for his essay on
American slang --

Subject:      Negri's Leopardi
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

My translation-appropriation (use) of Toni Negri's article on Leopardi
can be read at  http://hypobololemaioi.com/hyoeides/harm.html
The French translation from the Italian can be read at
http://multitudes.samizdat.net

What Negri might be writing in this article is a text to shade out
Benjamin's Baudelaire, that contradictory figure, a prototype for
which appears at the end of WB's essay on Kracauer, "And if we wish to
gain a clear picture of him in the isolation of his trade, what we
will see is a ragpicker, at daybreak, picking up rags of speech and
verbal scraps with his stick and tossing them, grumbling and growling,
a little drunk, into his cart, not without letting one or another of
those faded cotton remnants--"humanity," "inwardness," or
"absorption"--flutter derisively in the wind. A ragpicker, early on,
at the dawn of the day of the revolution." (The essay was published in
1930 in two versions for Die Gesellschaft and Die literarische Welt.)
Though Benjamin is fascinated in the Passagen with the pencil-sketch
(or was it charcoal?) Baudelaire had made of Blanqui found among his
papers, he never tries to make Baudelaire into a revolutionary, after
the political sense. It seems strange that the 19th century still
lacks a revolutionary figure among its pleiade of poets. Negri's
Leopardi is trying to suggest such a figure, one more substantial than
Marti. The paragraphs on Whitman that were cut in the edit of Empire
read like Lunacharsky. There are many other Whitmans, but the authors
weren't able to do the philology. Could it be that philosophy,
political philosophy, needs such a figure as Leopardi, to help it to
remember to dream and boldly--if it is still possible for philosophy
to remember 1848?

The Mandelstam I write about has a relation to international modernism
much in the same way that Negri writes about Leopardi's relation to
the mid nineteenth-century revolutionary milieu in Europe. Benjamin's
Baudelaire leaves literary history with a central figure whose
manifold contradictions prevent the full dimension of dignity being
according to the labor of language that is poetry. This dignity is to
be found only in the approach of the poetic to the conceptual terrain
of philosophy and temporary, or temporal, habitations of its
theoretical language, since it is only from this direction that an
approach to revolutionary politics by way of the poetic can be
attempted without the overlapping spheres of the language-work
belonging to either poetry or philosophy surrendering to the purely
formal, static, abstract condition of political language
proper. Approach, not adaptation. It is not an issue of language being
appropriated for the purposes of propaganda, using works of art for
political ends. My work is opposed to this. Mandelstam even writes
that poetry may fall outside the sphere of culture altogether in the
ceaseless work of evading interpretation and definition, a place in
the world.

Especially interesting to me is the function of the poetry of
O.M. translated into English during the Cold War period to construct a
myth of the Western Poet destroyed by the totalitarian state, when the
very notion of the 'West' is a problem for Mandelstam, and his
position towards the 1917 revolution was among the most understanding
of the poets of his generation. "Classicism is revolutionary," he
writes, and the record of his critical writings discloses sharp and
prescient disagreements with the restoration that begins in the late
1920s. His essay on Dante gives to the history of poetry an
uncompromising figure in the bringing near to the State the Poetic,
the critique by the Poetic of the State and its operations of absolute
violence.  Mandelstam's Dante is a devastating chronicler of the
abuses of State power.  Negri's Leopardi is also trying to evoke a
figure whose writings never depart from the demands of the poetic,
which are never topical nor opportunistic, and it is in this sense
that both poets also offer counter-figures to the kind of use to which
Slavoj Zizek puts Brecht in the essay-postscript following his recent
selection of political writings by Lenin.  The equally uncompromising
critique by Walter Benjamin of the class relations which exert such a
determinative influence in the sphere of cultural production appear
especially relevant at the contemporary moment when the digitalization
of knowledge anticipated in the  "Passagen" and the corresponding
pressure on language-works and art-works to bear knowledge are being
posed.

Perhaps it is impossible for philosophy, or even cultural criticism,
to impose on the past in the search for a future a revolutionary
figure arriving from the poetic, and yet what's at stake may be the
multidimensionality of the language-work, freeing philosophy from
ontology, freeing poetry from the abyss of its limitless interiorities
and just as limitless surfaces, and freeing politics from the State
and returning the sphere of the political to the Society where the
language of politics has a chance of signifying. No one has really
heard what that language sounds like since no one has heard this kind
of coming into being of a class, despite all the work trying to find
the Parisian proletariat in the Passagen. In the age of strict
divisions and hierarchies at the beginning of the 20th century, both
Malevich and Mandelstam write about how their contemporaries outdid
each other in their will to annihilate one another, what Malevich
referred to as the 'Golden Age.' He said it was a race to send one
another's works to the cemetery. Mandelstam said of his generation
that it was an unprecedented enmity that made the hatreds of the
Classicists and the Romanticists look like child's play (and it wasn't
child's play in mid-19th century in France, nor in the France of the
Surrealists, both right and left wings). In comparison, 19th century
American poetry feels blithely other to all this, and is it possible
to speak of some sort of inheritance? Tradition? Whatever it is that
is orthodoxy? One such doxa might be the strict separation of the
spheres of language activity.

The false empiricism of watching events as they happen and stopping
and feeling bad about them.

I find Negri's critique fascinating, rewarding, etc. However, I am a bit
mystified or not totally prepared by the piece to interpret the last
portion:

"The false empiricism of watching events as they happen and stopping
and feeling bad about them."

What would be "true empiricism" and what empiric factors make it possible to
transcend the momentary character of witness and feeling (good or bad) to
create - I assume - either an art with a more sustainable set of feelings or
a higher realm of art that dismisses the temporality of momentary witness
and feeling as a requirement at all.

Kevin, can you take us beyond speculation  here? I guess I am witnessing and
feeling events (interpreting, thinking, as well) as much as I can and I am
curious how Negri may consider empirical passion as off course!

POG

presents
poet Anselm Hollo and painter Michael Cajero
Saturday, April 26, 7pm
Dinnerware Gallery, 135 East Congress
Admission: $5; Students $3

Additional Event: “Innovative Poetry: Life Outside the Box,” a talk by
Anselm Hollo followed by discussion: Friday, April 25, 2pm, UA English
Department, Modern Languages Building 451; this event is free and open to
the public.  (For directions, or advice about parking, phone POG at 615-7803
or email pog@gopog.org.)  Co-sponsored by Arizona Quarterly and the UA
Poetry Center.

Anselm Hollo was born in Helsinki, Finland, and was educated there and in
the U.S. In his early twenties, he left Finland to live and work as a writer
and translator, first in Germany and Austria, then in London, where he was
employed by the BBC's European Services in their Finnish Program from 1958
to 1967. Translations into Finnish from that time include Allen Ginsberg's
Howl and John Lennon's In His Own Write.
For the last thirty years, Hollo has lived in the United States, teaching
creative writing and literary translation at numerous colleges and
universities, including SUNY Buffalo, The University of Iowa, and The
University of Colorado. He is now Associate Professor in the Graduate
Writing and Poetics Department at The Naropa Institute.
Hollo has published more than thirty-five books and chapbooks, most recently
Corvus (Coffee House Press, 1995) and AHOE (Smokeproof Press, 1997). He has
also translated many contemporary Finnish poets, among them Paavo Haavikko
and Pentti Saarikoski, as well as fiction, plays, and poetry from the
German, French, Swedish, and Finnish.
Hollo's honors and awards include the New York State Creative Artists'
Public Service Award (1976), a National Endowment for the Arts Poet's
Fellowship (1979), the P.E.N./American-Scandinavian Foundation Award for
Poetry in Translation (1981), the American-Scandinavian Foundation Award for
Poetry in Translation (1989), Fund for Poetry Awards for Contributions to
Contemporary Poetry (1989, 1991), The Finnish Government Prize for
Translation of Finnish Literature (1996), and a Gertrude Stein Award in
Innovative American Poetry 1995-1996 (1996).

Michael Cajero. It was back in grad school, at Kent State University,
thatCajero first came under the spell of the ephemeral. He had been doing
regular two-dimensional paintings, applying pigment to the flat surfaces of
cloth or paper, when he started hearing about process art and arte povera.
These two schools emphasized what Cajero calls the "physicality of
materials" and "raw forms," giving equal value to such highly prized media
as oils and marble and mass-marketed goods. Cajero started experimenting
with junk materials designed not to last--masking tape and cheap wrapping
paper and newsprint. He twisted them into sculptural forms and spattered
them with paint.

After picking up a master's in painting, sculpture and art history, Cajero
came back home to his native Tucson. Immersed once again in the folkloric
imagery of the Hispanic Southwest, he began to see that the materials of
arte povera would make a perfect marriage with the icons of Mexican folk
art. Mexican artists of necessity have long used cheap, transitory materials
for their works--bread, sugar, clay--and Cajero mimicked this practice by
using paper and tape to make Mexicanesque skeletons and dancers and
musicians. Over the years Cajero, who teaches regularly at Pima College, the
Tucson Museum of Art and the UA, has taken these folkloric figures into new
territory. In 1992, the 500th-year anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the
New World, Cajero filled an entire room in the University of Arizona Museum
of Art with giant "light altars" chronicling the disasters of the Spanish
Conquest.

From my experience working at an agency that represented leading cognitive scientists, the animus that characterized lit theory in the seventies is de rigeur in the brain
sciences today, for the very reason that the field still has more speculation than consensus; for example, Stephen Pinker's occasionally histrionic embrace of genetic
determinism is more marketing ploy than description of reality, and the recent vogue of computational models for consciousness is yet another theory, no more able to
reveal impetus than certain acts of faith.  I'd argue that cutting-edge poetry is no more (or less) likely to find forms in electroencephalography than in afro picks.

I was hoping someone could be more specific.  What specific styles, techniques, methods, forms, diction, whatever, has theory contributed to contemporary poetry?  Are these good?  Why?

Let me indulge my skepticism for a sec (as if I ever do anything else).  Take a book such as _My Life_.  Now, I find this work punishingly boring.  Others don't.  Fine.  But, based on my recollection, which may not be accurate, correct me if I'm wrong, it seems to me that one *might* say that Hejinian owes just about everything to Stein and other modernist poets, and that her debt to theory is not really visible on the page.  And perhaps, risking another possibly insipid assertion, one could say that what is usually taken to be "experimental" writing today likewise owes 99% of its styles, techniques, mannerisms, etc., to modernist models.  (Re-read Kenner's chapter on "Words Set Free" in _The Pound Era_ if you need to remind yourself just how little difference there is, formally, between what Williams was doing in _Spring And All_ and what scads of young poets are doing today.  And how much better Williams was, too, of course.)

So, if all theory has done is to encourage poets to think that imitating Stein or some other traditional poet will give their work philosophical or political bite, then theory has not done much more for poetry than re-certify (within the academy at least) certain models for literary imitation.  OR?

Ravi, that's so funny!  I got halfway through your sentence and was
wondering if anyone was going to bring up Pinker, and then you had...
Does this mean that poets possess the anima that can counterbalance today's
animus?  After all, poet's have more connections (neurons) between the
hemispreres of the corpus collossum, just as women have more compared to
what men are generally genetically predisposed to get.  (Yes, it's only a
theory of mine that poets and other artists, both male and female) have more
of these than their peers on the planet, and hence they greater
sophistication of emotion; they can "experience" MORE emotions and they can
articulate the nuances of those emotions in greater depth and quality.
They're favored (or plagued, the neanderthals would perhaps say) by this
actual physical difference between the male and female, and artist/nonartist
brain wiring).
Pinker's worth and merits...  Yes, it debatable whether he's just a groovy
guy marketeer or his theories in that first book (the green one, smile) are
really any good.  I'm referring to the book in which he argues that humans
have an innate predisposition to develop speech and communication, that even
a wildboy brought up by wolves will develop a language or something like
that.  Sorry, but it's been a long time since I (mis)read him, and I'm being
lazy at the moment.
Still, imagine something like that being true and, then, other
ramifications: Namely, do we not have innate tendencies to develop forms of
thought and human emotion that would prevail even if the Bush wacks "took
over" for 20-30 years (something I fear, though I know I should look at this
with some time-perspective)?  Is it guaranteed, somehow, that even if they
eliminated everybody but themselves and their types, their deeper genetic
codes would produce great-grandchildren one day who would figure out how to
reverse their devastation and return the species to sanity (or our
definition of same)?  I.e., even if they started a centuries long repression
of ambiguity tolerance, genetics would guarantee that ambiguity tolerance
will survive no matter how destructive they are?
Or are there no guarantees in evolution theory truly that "humans" are
getting wiser, kinder, more honest, more cooperative vs. competive (Riane
Eisler)?  Evolution only says that certain ones survive; only human
rationality and optimism prone thinkers would argue that "THE STRONG are the
wise, good, and poetic ones."  "The Strong" could be those who would kill
off emotion, sensitivity, compassion, altruism, cooperation--who can deaden
themselves to all but the most selfish and "inhuman" impulses and instincts
and compulsions and personlity traits.  Or there could be mutation that
would similarly favor the ambiguity murderers.  (This scares me, naturally.)
I would prefer to be comforted by some science that says "strong" means all
the kind of culture, ambiguity tolerance, etcetera, that has generally
prevailed for thousands of years, that it's all coded in already, that
"they," the neoconservatives and their spawn CANNOT outlast anybody.  But
these are biases of a rational and compassion sort of person; science and
evolution do not necessarily say or prove that this is the case...

 It was in a recent conversation that the above phrase came up. It was
attributed to Harry S. Truman, and, without checking references, I am
reasonably sure that that is at least a likely attribution. Nonetheless,
I have left it in the form in which it was pronounced, at second hand, a
possible paraphrase, in order to open a series of questions. So much of
what passes for public discourse operates as a paraphrase, even if in
only the most minimal sense, as occurs in the recording and transmission
of spoken dialogue, or the presumed verisimilitude of an unintentional,
unimpeded, camera. Let us begin, then, with the notion of a phrase. From
the Greek phrasis, ^=CCphrase=B9 is both a noun and a verb: a phrase is =B3=
(1)a
manner or style of expression, esp. that peculier to a language, author,
literary work, etc..., or (2)a small group or collocation of words
expressing a single notion...(4)exclamatory or exaggerated talk...or,
from fencing: (6)a continuous passage in an assault without any cessation
of attack and defence.=B2 As a verb, to phrase means =B3to (3)designate,
describe or (2)put into words, (1)to employ a phrase or phrases, (6)to
divide, or mark off, to perform according to the phrases, or (4)to do (a
thing) away, or do (a person) out of, by phrases or talk.=B2 Here I have
paraphrased some of the definitions found in the Oxford English
Dictionary. And here, I paraphrase Jean-Fran=E7ois Lyotard: A phrase is
undoubtable; it is immediately presupposed. To doubt that one phrases is
still to phrase, one=B9s silence makes a phrase, or phrases, because the
singular calls forth the plural, and vice versa. In the disputation of
phrases^=CBthis will surprise no one^=CBsilence is compelled to an alliance=
,
and cannot circumscribe an unmarked neutrality. Vulgar slogans can
sometimes be ironically accurate: ^=CCyou are part of the problem, or you
are part of the solution.=B9 Especially when silence is prefigured as a
certain sort of phrase, already in dispute, configured within an
asymmetrical power-relation. A differend (in a minimal paraphrasing of
Lyotard), distinguished from a litigation, would be a case of conflict
between (at least) two parties, that cannot be equitably resolved for
lack of a rule of judgement applicable to both arguments.  The legitimacy
of one side does not imply the other=B9s lack of legitimacy. Applying a
single rule of judgement to both sides in order to settle their
differend, as though it were a mere litigation, would wrong at least one
of them, and would wrong both of them if neither side recognizes and
admits this rule. Damages result from an injury which is inflicted upon
the rules of a genre of discourse but which is reparable according to
those rules. A wrong results from the fact that the rules of the genre of
discourse by which one judges are not those of the judged genre or genres
of discourse. Especially if one considers diplomacy, for example to be a
genre of international relations. Or the conduct of war, or of enterprise
as genres; perhaps a new genre of interests: war and commerce. As Lyotard
points out, =B3...a universal rule of judgement between heterogenous genres
is lacking in general.=B2 Even--paraphrasing again--the most ordinary
phrase is constituted according to a set of rules (a regimen). There are
a number of phrase regimens: reasoning, knowing; describing, recounting,
showing, ordering, questioning, etc. Phrases from heterogenous regimens
cannot be translated from one into the other. They can be linked one onto
the other in accordance with an end fixed by a genre of discourse.
Lyotard=B9s examples: dialogue links an ostentation (showing) or a
definition (describing) onto a question; what is at stake in this are the
two parties coming into an agreement about the sense of a referent.
Genres of discourse supply rules for linking heterogenous phrases, rules
that are proper and necessary for attaining certain goals: to know, to
teach, to seduce, to be just, to evaluate, to oversee. To liberate.


commutability

 Hegel had once said =B3the face of the enemy is always blank,=B2 a phrase
which we may understand as indicating a certain virtuality, a structural
(dis)position in potentia which is always available to be filled in, an
armature to support all of the attributes and attributions--of depravity,
of bestiality, of cruelty and evil--ascribed to a certain species of
other: the enemy. And, like any such phantasmatic field (the cinematic
screen is another), multiple identifications and investments can be made,
upon the same surface, pluralizing, with multiple and permeable
occupations, the entire space. The ^=CCfigure=B9 of Saddam is phrased as
coextensive with a succession of proper names: Hitler, Stalin, Tito, bin
Laden, with multiple roles--dictator, thug, despot, psychopath, or with
abstract qualities: evil, cruel, decadent, inhuman. This is not to
dispute any confirmed evidence of the monstrosities conducted under
Saddam=B9s regime, but merely to point out that such attributions operate
to precluce or delegitimate certain references, and to legitimate and
emphasize others without recourse to a common ground of reference or of
judgement. That is, these interpermeable attributions appear in/as
phrases operating as/within a differend, even as they lay claim to an
authority which purports to be common, consensual and absolute. The
^=CCenemy=B9 is thus an active field wherein, for example, the figure namin=
g
any tactical form of villainy is commutable to that of Saddam Hussein, so
that the ^=CCfigure=B9 which is rendered of ^=CCSaddam=B9 is, accordingly, =
here a
paraphrase of Osama bin Laden, there of Hitler or Stalin, each commutable
to the other, each occupying in collusion the space of the ^=CCenemy=B9
linked to the phrasing of unconsionable evil, of the necessity of
deposition, and to the claims of an inviolable will to truth. The formal
characteristics of such a logic do not admit any other phrases than those
that conform to the tacit correspondence theory of the truth which is
vindicated by recourse to the register of phrases which have already been
rendered overwhelmingly ^=CClegitimate.=B9
 Consider the logic of another form of commutability: =B3(to date) no
^=CCweapons of mass-destruction=B9 have been found (the ostensible enabling
rational for the invasion of Iraq); since they must have been there, and
are no longer present, they must have gone somewhere else. Where? Most
likely to Syria. Syria is adjacent to Iraq; it=B9s borders are open to any
with a passport from an Arabic country; Syria is listed as a state which
aids and abets terrorism (it=B9s on the ^=CClist=B9). Syria is suspected of
having aided and sent supplies and weapons to the Iraq during ^=CCOperation
Iraqi Freedom.=B9 So, one must assume that Syria now possesses those
weapons of mass-destruction, and is probably also sheltering high-ranking
refugees from the former Iraqi state. It is therefore now necessary that
Syria give up those, and any other, weapons of mass-destruction, as well
as the Iraqi war-criminals, or face ^=CCvery serious consequences=B9 for
noncompliance with the will of the ^=CCworld=B9 (a compliance such as would
require weapons inspectors, economic sanctions, and a detailed plan,
available corporate investment potential, and a will to act).=B2 Of course
such weapons, and such criminals may just as readily migrate to Iran, to
Egypt, and elsewhere, and the same logic by which Iraq was diminished
will apply, with the same legitimacy--growing in force by it=B9s assumed
^=CCinevitability=B9--to these, and to any state deemed undesirable or a
threat to American interests. To such a list one might add Cuba and
Venezuela, and one might begin to speculate a bit more about the future
of other, farther, places.



inevitability

 Once the form of phrasing has been linked to a presumed
^=CCinevitability,=B9 a disymmetry in the disputation of phrases is set int=
o
place which does not silence, but renders ineffective, or ^=CCirrelevant,=
=B9
any dissenting voices. It is a bit like a bully on a gradeschool
playground, whose predation on younger smaller children is seen by others
as a form of strength or exercise of will, so that still others who see
the forms of violation that take place do so within the already
sanctioned and established referential frame. One might phrase it as a
^=CCcondition of possibility,=B9 a ^=CCsurvival of the fittest,=B9 or a
^=CCpreemptive protection of interests.=B9 A default judgement: a judgement
which aligns itself --a judgement which people make--because it is
easier, cheaper, less tragic and less labor- or capital-intensive to make
than thinking or confronting what is happening directly. Because it is a
fait accompli; because it was  therefore inevitable, and other species of
the same phrasing are inevitable, too, a part of the same process, linked
to the same history, and the same power. A succession of paraphrases in
dispute.



(parenthesis on media): the intercession of  the camera

=2E . . the camera does not see . . .
       ^=CBWalter Benjamin

 In an essay which is perhaps read too often, and too quickly, Walter
Benjamin marks a distinction between the camera=B9s optics and human
perception, noting the camera=B9s intervention into the sphere of human
visuality, via the substitution of a nonconscious instrumentality in the
place of our own regard. That is, at a remove, in a deferral which
institutes an aporia in perception via certain intercessionary
technologies--photography, cinema, digital media--which is difficult to
discern or to avoid. It is in this gap that a catachretic linkage is
effected such that ^=CCevidence=B9 as a material trace is rendered commutab=
le
with the regimen of phrases. An image, senseless and illegible by itself,
is linked via a series of naturalized supplements--paratextual
phrasings--to an order of sense and evidence. And as such it enters into
disputation as a supplementation or negation linking to other phrases.

 For all of its increasing sophistication, the camera remains an
instrument of citation, a ^=CCwriting in/of light=B9 which secures only the
most minute trace, or movement, as it flashes by (aufblitzendes), caught,
inscribed in the particulate grain of photo-chemical materiality,
inscribed into the regimen of rules for constituting phrases,
inextricably linked to a register of evidence. There is no interiority to
the photograph, the transmission, the image. Still, when we see what the
camera has recorded it nonetheless engages a reflex within us, one that
perceives light and shadow, movement, and even reflection, as substance,
and, in the case of  photographically recorded images of people, which
compels in us a recognition and response to a presumed other, the
presence of some person or thing seen as having actually appeared before
the camera, within the frame of the image, operating at its presumed
point of origin. Facial recognition is one of our earliest unconscious
accomplishments, hardwired in us even as infants; the camera intervenes
in that, to present a technically reproducible shadow, an apparition of
presence, one which operates at the same time as an index of loss. This
also happens with the reproduction/transmission of images, where the
presumption of the presence of the ^=CCeye=B9 of the operator is also linke=
d
to the chain of presumed presences, coextensive with the aperture of the
camera. For Benjamin, it is through the instrumentality of the camera
that =B3an unconsciously penetrated space is substituted for a space
consciously explored,=B2 where the naturalization of prosthetic perception
via the camera =B3introduces us to unconscious optics as does
psychoanalysis to unconscious impulses.=B2 That is, at a remove, outside
the image or scene, with a compulsion to repetition and the promise of
 recuperation, so that there is an uncanny doubling of the camera=B9s
unconscious optics with our own impulses, a technico-philosophical
sleight of hand that purports to secure the whole of the real, by
phrasing the trace-image as ^=CCevidentiary.=B9 It is the very definition o=
f
the phantasm. Mediologic perception is folded back into experience, an
artificial memory, naturalized and subsumed, which presents the proleptic
promise of recall, even as it circumscribes a doubled site of loss,
producing a malleable ^=CCreal,=B9 which is at every moment a virtual
supplement to the evidentiary. What we thought were sensations have
become ghosts, transfixed in a flash, mere afterimages; we are haunted by
such images, even as those images are haunted by other, absent, traces of
an elsewhere that we have made our own, domesticated fragments which we
have compelled to enter into other relations, different economies of
sense and reference. Linked to phrasing--nostalgia, kitsch, sentiment-- a
presence deferred to an impossible proximity, but never lost entirely.
The patterns of deferred presences may be considered a species of
allusion, and it is within the space of allusion that a complex linkage
and interplay of simulation and dissimulation occurs, through which we
recognize, engage with, and consume images, and their supplementarities.
Our presumption of the verisimilitude of the camera--of its
^=CCobjectivity=B9 and it=B9s tacit claim to the truth of human presence,
evidence of the eye, or of the hand, of what has happened--is
produced--phrased--according to certain habitual discursive rules, allied
to the seductions of power and interest. This phraseology, which has
persisted as an index to the photographic apparatus since its origins, is
now being aggressively deployed to further contemporary
political-economic interests in a manner which masks and impedes any
heuristic or recourse to analysis by precluding other phrases or
interpretations which fix, or arrest, the mediologic trace as a certain
kind of evidence-in-dispute.
 Thomas Y. Levin has argued persuasively that =B3the epistemology of the
=B3realism=B2 of the ^=CCeffect of the real=B9 produced by classical contin=
uity
editing in film is fundamentally based on the referential surplus value
of photo-chemical indexicality.=B2 The history of our apprehension of the
material basis of the photographic artifact as depicting an image of
something has secured for the photograph--and for all subsequent
photographic media-- a powerful, if problematic, signifying presence. If
there was a certain era in the reception of photography where such
artifacts could be unproblematically introduced as, for example, evidence
of culpability or innocence in a court of law, or convincing proof of
political events or natural phenomena, today no such claim to evidentiary
verisimilitude can be presumed, as the consequences of an increasingly
widespread recognition of the  photographic surface as a complex and
hybrid construct become increasingly salient in the public sphere. We
find ourselves tracing the hitherto hidden contours of a constantly
renegotiated and =B3generalized pedagogy of verisimilitude=B2 only to have
ourselves cast back, reinscribed into a subject-position wherein our
perception and consumption of images is shaped and constrained by a
register of habits, a regimen of rules, a tracery of assigned
attributions.


commutability, again

 There is a commutability in the materiality of signs, a system of
equivalences constructed between a trace, an edit, a mark, the grain of
reactive photo-chemical deposition, a pattern of pixels or the disparate
charges of electrons and the relations it establishes to its own
exteriority through patterns of phrasing, forming preconditions for
judgement and action. While there may be an assumed equivalence on the
material axis between the profoundly unintentional tracings in light
which are mechanically produced, or those which have come about through
the intercession of discursive and technological phrasings, we still find
ourselves arrested, silent, alone before the image, a moment before a
flicker of recognition sets in, a recognition that has far more to do
with habit and interest, than with truth or evidence. There is a profound
difference between believing what we see and believing what we are shown.



(another parenthesis on media): immediacy

 There are three primary aspects of the photographic image to be
considered in any consideration of the evidentiary. These aspects are
(1)-armature, (2)-trace, and (3)-relay.

1. The photographic artifact is an armature in that in order to ^=CCappear=
=B9
at all it must constantly support linkage to innumerable and exterior
discursive pattern. The constant possibility of these linkages are
necessary to constitute the persistence of its identity as an artifact.
For example, an overwhelming percentage of photographic processes never
result in a discrete photographic artifacts;  consider video surveillance
systems, which cycle through, overwriting upon itself, in segments of an
hour, two, three, nine, or twenty-four hour increments. It is only when
some extraordinary act--the commission of a crime, or a natural
disaster--occurs that the photographic project is arrested, and an image
is fixed, and linked to  a set of discursive, and often contentious,
 phrases. The arrestment of the image and its inscription into a
discursive field are coextensive.

2. It is through such arrestments, situating or fixing the image in place
within a particular regimen (of rules for evidence, for example) that the
referential is articulated. The presumption (regimen) of presence casts
the photograph as a trace of something which has taken place, securing
for this nascent object, in the very moment of its appearance, an
evidentiary disposition.

3. As such an image is always immanent (a material armature) and never
closed (it is is formed as a trace of something) in that it can be
endlessly linked to orders of verisimilitude (inscribed into the
disputation of phrases as an evidentiary trace of competing or confirming
evidence), and in that manner be tactically deployed.

 The relation between these aspects of the media-image are not
consequential but entailed; they are not progressive, but instantaneous
and simultaneous, and their ^=CCtaking place=B9 renders the relation of
interiority and exteriority radically indeterminate, so that technically
reproducible images are incessantly inscribed into the heterogenous
conflict of phrases, shaped--in lieu of the regimen of consensus--by
power and interest. The image is arrested (as what it is/purports to be)
through the register of legitimating/delegitimating phrases, an exterior,
almost auratic, relation to the inaccessible ^=CCtruth=B9 of technical
reproducibility. These pre-existing rules of phrasing determine the
^=CCnature=B9 within which the technically reproducible image ^=CCtakes pla=
ce=B9
as such. As simple example: in the moment that the jubilant faces of
celebrating children in Palestine were inscribed into the phrasing of the
aftermath of 9-11, a secondary image of the ^=CCenemy=B9 was substantiated,
given a face. No matter that it was later revealed that the footage had
been taken some four months previous to the terrorist attacks on New York
City and Washington DC, and was about something else entirely. The effect
had already taken place, the attribution, even if it was disarticulated
and overturned, persists as an unconscious proleptic charge, evidence for
a claim in dispute. A picture of the enemy, without the unnecessary
recourse to truth, was beginning to appear, and would need do no more
that to have flickered before us as an evidentiary trace, if only for a
moment,  to operate as an element in a regulated persuasion to judgement.



incommutability

 . . . 'consistency' is not 'truth'; 'conviction' is not 'ethics';
'success' is not 'evidence'. . .
        ^=CBAxel Idiart=E9 Monito

 The man who had masterminded the terrorist attack on the luxury liner
Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean had sanctuary in Iraq. He has now been
found and detained. This is a good thing; the 1985 attack had been a
despicable and inhuman act, and (hopefully) this responsible man will be
extradited to face his sentence according to international law. More
questionable--though this is a question that is excised from the current
rhetorical phraseology--is how this instance of ^=CCevidence=B9 that Iraq i=
s
harboring terrorists may serve as another a posteriori justification of
the invasion (e.g., by having replaced the search for weapons of
mass-destruction, by a pattern of commutable acts of indefinite extent).
It may be true that there are still many terrorists in Iraq (and in
Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Israel), perhaps as many as currently reside in the
United States, or in various European nations. But to link the presence
of any such individual to the policies of a State now, in conjunction
with the current invasion, and not at any other point of his residence,
is gross opportunism and distraction. It is not a question of
culpability--that had been determined in a court of law-- but to question
the rhetorical ellision by which the phrasing of this event serves as a
confirming instance or vindicating ^=CCproof=B9 of the right of the current
US political agenda, by ^=CCswapping out=B9 or occupying the empty field
within which the rationale of war is (re) phrased. It doesn=B9t authorize
simply by saying that it does, and offering a succession of image/phrases
in the evacuated space of ^=CCevidence=B9 to support the public image of
policy. Neither could any other similar instances of the attribution of
motive, whether speculative or ^=CCreal,=B9  of the ^=CCharboring of
terrorists=B9 be directed now, consecutively, to other states, Syria or
Iran, Algeria or Egypt, to serve to authorize military, political and
economic actions. Slavoj Zizek was correct in pointing out the surplus of
reasonings for attack, and that it is a surplus which readily exceeds the
fragile territories of a single target nation. What is most remarkable is
the radical generalization of reasoning coupled with an unnegotiable
assumption of authority, and an overriding will to deploy. It is not
surprising that there is a commensurate anxiety which is already directed
toward the revisionary^=CBrewriting a favorable history at the very moment
that it ^=CCoccurs.=B9 A revisionism both generalized and immediate, wherei=
n
the paradigmatic shifts in the category of ^=CCevidence,=B9 ^=CCproof,=B9 a=
nd
^=CCrationale=B9 are a virtually endless and repetitive succession of phras=
es
linking ^=CCconsequence=B9 to ^=CCreason.=B9 It is the same rhetorical form=
ulae,
over and over again, familiar and always at hand--as if war after war
represent just another species of technical reproducibility, whose
auratic presence is a (nostalgic) claim to an absent ^=CCgood war.=B9



a regulated and empowered relativism

 What is at stake is the regulation of the interarticulation of phrases
and images. This is, to be sure, a coextensive and permeable field:
images linked to phrases may be apprehended as either or both phrase
and/or image, sutured together to approximate the recognized regimen of
evidence, proof or (common) knowledge. It produces a subject-disposition
wherein ^=CCtruth=B9 is again less what you can see than what you are shown=
=2E
But it is crucial to look at who is doing the phrasing, to look at how,
and for whom, and to what end, and to whose benefit, the interrelations
of phrases and traces^=CBmediations^=CBare being constructed and regulated.
This operates on a very deep level, where perception, presumption, and
apprehension occur within a framework of unconscious habit and the
naturalization of technical mediations. In other words, in us. At the
same time, the process is also quite simple, even vulgar. When memory is
the remembrance of a memory, someone else=B9s memory^=CBas in the case of
media, producing an artificial memory of war as ^=CCthe good war=B9 modeled
on the mediations of the Second World War, supported by familiar
rhetorical forms^=CBproduces sentiment and nostalgia which, especially when
so induced, are organized into what one might call kitsch.

 Kitsch is the ability to surpass essential belongings and rest in more
superficial ones, to create an imaginary landscape through accumulation
and camouflage, and to crystallize the continuous movement of life in the
permeable disguise of fantasy.
       ^=CBCeleste Olalquiaga

It has to do with investment and reflex, habit and docility--the effect
of a suffusing corporate mentality, and a generations-long nurturing of a
culture of consumption, not only of commodities, but of ideas, and of
naturalized, tacit, recognitions of power, authority, hierarchy and
success, all of the tropes--persuasive phrasings--that have made us who
we think we are, and which allow us to have authorised by abeyance, our
own shallow consumption of the image the series of wars promulgated by
the Bush administration. Investments which allow us to abnegate thinking,
or the rigours of conscience, even the intensities of the labors of
cognition. We are a people who think with our pocketbooks, our wallets,
cable, dish and SUV, who think through running in place on a treadmill in
our gyms, while shopping, through one version or another of ^=CCreality
tv.=B9 We think through terror and atrocity and loss at a compensatory
remove, and we always, vigilantly, go about our business.


an uncanny and immediate memory

 Anamnesis/amnesis, memory and forgetting--one taken for the other,
inscribed within each other=B9s contours, an uncanny collapse of the
mediations between forgetting and remembrance, constrained to a specific,
present, moment. But there is a dissymmetry in the space of forgetting
when it is occupied by another memory, one which is not bound to the
specificities of place, time, or contingent events, but which
represents--for certain interests-- a tacit allegory of an abstract and
generalized condition such as ^=CCthe just conduct of war.=B9 It is not onl=
y
as Hegel suggested, that the face of the enemy is always blank, but that
there is a similar and antithetical  blankness always ready to be
deployed, one which grounds the thinking of, and commitment to, a
righteous deployment of force, unmediated by any ^=CCevidence=B9 contrary t=
o
the enabling terms of military opposition. An empty counterpart to the
blank countenance of ^=CCthe enemy,=B9 an empty semiotic hole whose specifi=
c
gravity must immediately be filled: identification and the other, ^=CCus=B9
and ^=CCthem,=B9 a tacit psychology which authorizes one thing by authorizi=
ng
another. An allegory of predation as defense. Such a process may be
called uncanny in that it represents the eruption of the unfamiliar
within the familiar as the familiar. The first five entries on =B3uncanny=
=B2
in the Oxford English Dictionary all have to do with mischief, malice,
carelessness, unreliability, lack of caution or trust, difficulty or
severity^=CBand uncomfortability, especially as regards the supernatural,
the strange or unfamiliar. In the psychoanalytic register the term is far
more determinate, and heavily theorized, such that it is put into play
with discourses on simulation, mimesis, alterity, the sublime, the
abject, the alien. The space of memory which is occupied by another, more
familiar, memory^=CBfor example with the war in Iraq represented by
personal narratives of the soldiers at the front and their families at
home^=CB masks the phrasing of current events by a familiar trope which
defines a ^=CCmoral=B9 stance by reference to a more readily  consumable
model derived from secondary sources, movies, television, other histories
and events in the recent past. Such defining tropes claim an ^=CCimmediacy=
=B9
in every sense of the word, no least because they successfully mask their
origin at a distance from their reference, by masking their process of
mediation. A battle is represented in the way we represent a battle, a
war according to the authorised tropology of war, and persuasion by its
own means. There are similar ways of representing the end of a war.


an opportunism both virtual and reactive (commutability, once again)

 Now, soldiers have become policemen, and policemen have become soldiers;
volunteer police from coalition countries are deployed to occupy Iraqi
cities as a peacekeeping force while the soldiers who they will
supplement and replace currently occupy that civil position. Civilians
have become military, as armed corporate teams occupy strategic sites
such as oil wells, communications centers, and other infrastructural
territories. Such paramilitary forces as had been deployed in Kosovo and
other parts of the former Yugoslavia operate outside the checks and
balances of military law, as well as local civil authority. Criminal
events^=CBsuch as brutal slayings, rapes, maiming, pillage^=CBhad occurred
with these groups, and remain unprosecuted. As one such para-civilian
noted, unlike military ranks, these are =B3like any group of guys, (where)
there are some good guys and some bad ones.=B2 Halliburton, Dimecorp,
Lucent and other privileged corporate groups  favored by the Defense
Department have been ^=CCauthorised=B9 by the Bush administration to
^=CCprivatise=B9 Iraqi oil-production, and communications networks, with wh=
at
amounts to a corporate para-military occupation force. One might only
speculate on the hidden commutabilities between such terms as ^=CCIraqi
freedom=B9 and its counterpart, or what a phrase like ^=CCgiving back (oil,
government, artifacts, etc) to the Iraqi people,=B2 or what the phrase
=B3Iraqi people=B2 might really mean. Demonstrations in the streets of
Baghdad against American occupation are phrased as a freedom having been
granted to these people by the American occupation (another commutation:
=B3Isn=B9t freedom wonderful?=B2--George W. Bush).


the museum of public outrage

 Both the traditional definition of museum, and the etymological
complicity proposed by Theodor Adorno, have resolutely to do with what
has passed. In the first definition, from the Oxford English Dictionary,
the word refers to =B3the seat of the muses,=B2 or a repository of what has
been inspired by the Muses, whether of a natural order or of the making
of men. For Adorno the word museum was complicit with the word mausoleum,
a repository of dead things. Conventionally such repositories have to do
with artifacts, material, substantive things. This is even the case in
writing--even cuneiform-- whose material armature is but the means of
giving up its immateriality, as Augustine has said, of performing a
=B3communication with the absent.=B2 With what is passing away.

A society which rashly privileges the present^=CBreal time^=CBto the
detriment of both the past and the future, also privileges the
accident.                 ---Paul Virilio


In the very first sentence of an essay entitled =B3The Museum of
Accidents,=B2 Virilio presents us with a dilemma: can the accident ever be
consigned to the past, or a future accident be foreseen? If, in our
contemporary mediate world everything happens, unexpectedly and at every
moment, everywhere, abolishing--as Heidegger claimed--distance by
constant proximity, is there a possibility of the museum? If there is
only a present, within which the past is constantly constructed in the
present tense^=CBas is the future, and its claimed inevitabilities^=CBwhat =
is
the role of a =B3museum=B2? What might it contain? Or display? Or cover ove=
r,
and hide or vouchsafe from public purview? Or should we shift the
registration a bit, reframe the question, and ask what is it that shall
be cordoned off, removed from the ubiquitous present? Let us take a
concrete example: citizens of the United States of America have
traditionally and constitutionally enjoyed the right of free assembly. It
is closely aligned with the right of free speech. When the exercise of
these rights has taken the form of peaceful, organized protest of recent
events/policies (such as NAFTA, the most recent presidential election, or
the invasion of Iraq), the organizers have had to address a broad range
of legislations, local ordinances and court judgements to render their
action ^=CClegal.=B9 In most cases the right of assembly/free speech is
mediated by what have been termed =B3protest-pits,=B9 secure territories,
often at a far remove from the ostensible or symbolic group towards which
such communications are addressed. In Quebec City protesters of
international trade agreements were enclosed in a secure compound a mile
from the site occupied by the group they wanted to address. Media
coverage of this =B3protest-pit=B2 was minimized. The same has occurred wit=
h
environmentalist groups. The protest which was to have taken place in
front of the United Nations in mid-town Manhattan was denied, and then
moved to a route several blocks away. Media coverage was intermittant,
with a concentration on a series of small conflicts between police^=CBwho
were generally well-disposed towards demonstrators^=CBand groups milling
around   after the end of the event. The nature, numbers of marchers, and
demeanor of crowds was routinely distorted, in New York City, across the
country and across the globe. Are such =B3protest-pits=B2 --whether they ar=
e
a physical concentration of demonstrators in a secure, monitored, site or
^=CCre-framed=B9 by a media already of necessity in collusion with corporat=
e
interests--our new museums? An exercise of free speech in a past-perfect
tense, removed from any potential for potency and persuasion in the
present--that is to say mediated-- public sphere? Who is being addressed,
if the transmission is controlled, delayed or deferred? Or, perhaps in a
more cynical tone, is there any possibility of appeal to the public
conscience is such a substantive entity no longer exists? Or is a myth,
or a fiction, or another sort of construct entirely?

=2E . . neither matter nor space nor time has been what it was from time
immemorial.

         ---Paul Val=E9ry

Val=E9ry=B9s phrase, from =B3La Conqu=E8te de l=B9ubiquit=E9,=B2 was excerp=
ted from the
epigraph which opens Walter Benjamin=B9s essay on technical
reproducibility. Paul Virilio paraphrases Val=E9ry when he says that =B3we
might assert without fear of contradiction that =B3the time of the finite
world is coming to an end.=B2=B2 Virilio goes on to say that knowledge mark=
s
the finitude of man, just as ecology marks the finitude of the
geophysical environment. In a constant present, where free speech,
thought and action are circumscribed in a museum-like fashion, is the
overwhelming mark of our finitude the contour of corporate globalisation?




the reconstruction of media

 Um qasr, Iraq, the second week of April, 2003: the first radio station
to operate after the demise of Saddam Hussein begins broadcasting. Five
hundred radios have been given out; there are 20,000 more due to arrive
within days. Lucent Corporation has lucrative contracts to reconstruct
the communications infrastructure throughout Iraq; people will soon begin
receiving phone bills. The reconstruction of media will require the
reconstruction of forms of attention and subjectivity which are more
amenable to the new corporate communications infrastructures than had
been hitherto achieved by a people who had so recently thought of radios
as =B3rocks with tails, which made noise=B2 (Abderhaman Munif). The image o=
f
this new people is already being constructed, in advance of those who, in
their own lives, and minds, and marketplaces, will fill in--flesh
out--its contours. =B3You are a consumer, or you are a target.=B2 Another
commutation, whose ironic common point is the blank, empty space of
subjectivity: one will be a certain thing, an enemy or a
capitalist--there is no other position, and one will accomodate the image
that precedes the substance. There will be more consumers and there will
be more terrorists. The pictoriality that Heidegger spoke of in his essay
Die Zeit des Weltbildes is a precessionary simulation that requires the
conformity of precise subject-positions. Manipulate the picture, and you
will have controlled the substantive real. This is the primary mediation.


the possibility of an open future

 Now things are quiet, and our is spent; events as they speed into the
past have taken on the definition of inevitability. But it is a
definition which is not constrained to some simple idea of the past, but
suffuses a logic of entailment, or of necessity. An interesting state, as
a past is wiped away--was the persistence of Babylonian artifacts an
unnecessary luxury after all? Who needs cuneiform, in a new world?--and
the future is again a virgin territory, a tabula rasa, unencumbered by
the tangle of laws, references, people, restored to a state of nature--or
at least of undeveloped resources.  At this quiet moment, when the
impulse for even the words you hold before you has seemingly passed, when
the cautions presented herein are almost no longer topical, when they are
overtaken by a silence (of resignation? of the inevitable?) that covers
us, as if we have passed, in this quiet moment it is more important than
ever to look carefully at what is still happening, at what has just
happened, and at their complexities, complicities and resistances. Here,
in this silent aftermath, we must struggle to pose questions.


some questions

1.  Is it possible to see a comprehensive and accurate picture of the
effects of the invasion of Iraq to date? And to base speculations on the
future on accurate models of the shape of the present?

2.  What has happened to domestic legislation, to constitutionally
guaranteed rights and freedoms, and to international law under the
current US administration? What, objectively, is the form of government
of the United States of America?

3.  Can a nation^=CBany nation, every nation^=CB be run like a corporation?

4. Can other nations be dealt with according to corporate interests? How
will such corporate interests change or modify international law?

5.  Has the future of national sovereignty come to an end?

6.  Will Iraqi people be ^=CCre-educated=B9 as consumers? Is the only
^=CCdemocratic state=B9 the one that is defined, by the US, as a capitalist
state? Are the Iraqi (Syrian, North Korean, etc.) people ^=CCjust like us=
=B9
and do ^=CCthey want what we want=B9?

7.  Is there a possibility of any culture other than a global, corporate,
culture?

8.  Who claims the right to tell the truth? For whom? To what end? Under
what conditions? What is the role of ^=CCtruth-telling=B9 in the contempora=
ry
American political sphere?

9. Is corporate globalism indeed the mark of our contemporary finitude?
Or is democracy still possible? How? Where?

10. Is the separation of state and corporation possible?


one definition and three epigraphs

 Apocalypticism--a relatively recent word deriving from the Greek word
for revelation--refers to a complex of ideas associated with the
'opening' or prefiguring of the end of history, whether it be the
Armageddon depicted in the Bible or more secular versions of final
destruction. Apocalypticism is usually associated with a
self-righteousness of the elect (those privy to revelation or proleptic
foreshadowing) which engenders dangerous forms of fanaticism. The final
end, the end of 'history' one might suppose is an 'endless end' which is
constantly 'phrased,' an 'interminable phrasing' in Lyotard's terms, one
which admits of no termination, no end, no final phrase, a Differend with
a capital 'D,' the excession of all regimens.


  Today is a great day for the history of freedom

  all things are less than
  they are,
  all are more.

Andy,

It seems to me theory (more specifically poetics) argues for what has already
been written -creates its intellectual framework- rather than prescribe
anything for the future.

Well, first off I can tell you that even I as a non-scientist can smell the
rat behind S Pinker's pop science assertions and (to a lesser degree) the
hard AI computational theory of the brain as outlined by Daniel Dennett and
others. These people have nothing to do with brain science as it is
currently practiced other than as outsiders looking in and popularizing the
serious labor of legitimate researchers. (Dennett, it must be said, is also
a fairly interesting philosopher in his own right.) Moreover, I don't see
any substantial animus from within the field, and frankly would question
that it exists in the form you describe. Can you give concrete evidence of
this? Finally, the notion that brain science is little more than an article
of faith is one I would vigorously dispute. We may only know a tiny fraction
of the way the brain works at this stage, but we certainly are making
definite progress in our understanding of its many elements, and can
consider these accomplishments as vastly more rigorous and concrete than any
burning bush. Think of all the treatments we now have for the various forms
of brain disease (hardly the stuff of alchemy and voodoo!), and of the
invention of "miracle" technologies like the CAT scan that can vividly map
changing states of being as they happen. (Which makes me think: Has anybody
charted what gets fired in the brain when somebody is reading a rich,
complex poem? I think that this would reveal far more about the poetic
experience than what most of today's academic literary theorists have to
say.)

In sum: Brain science is VASTLY more advanced than the charting of
electroencephalograms and faith-based speculations into how the mind
functions! I mean, come on!

Despite their bashing here and elsewhere President and mrs. Bush have
probably made more specific contributions to poetry in the last few months
(via annoying poets) than all of the heralded THEORISTS.  that might be the
basis for the disgruntlement at the meeting?

I'm not sure what Sontag would say about all these brain scans, but just as
"photographs of an atrocity may give rise to opposing responses.  A call for
peace. A cry for revenge" (p. 13, _Regarding the Pain of Others_) I wonder
what the responses would b to a picture of the amygdala in motion of someone
committing an atrocity and how it would play on the evening news and would
the consulting neuroscientists Ravi mentions be sponsoring the news?  Or
would the Univ. of Phoenix be billed for the time?

OK folks--this is probably the last of the bibliographical cries for help

Thanks for your patience....the Raworth issue, all 280-odd-pages of it, is
now all done, barring the loose ends in the bibliography, a few touchups to
the index, & writing a brief postface.  Once these are cleared up it'll be
off to the printers.  It's quite the book! -- all best --N

Miscellaneous work by Raworth.


OBITS.

[The problem here is that the electronic resources I have to rely on are
mightily inconsistent about which edition of a paper they use, on whether
they supply page numbers, on whether they specify the section a piece
appears in or not (if it's a multisection paper), &c. & so I can't always
tell if the page number I have indeed properly locates the piece. -- I have
all these obits in electronic form, so do not need copies; just need
confirmation/supply of the details.  Any information on prior obits would be
useful, though, as my sources seem to peter out before 1994.  I am only
aware of one earlier piece, on Asa Benveniste.]

REVIEWS by Raworth.

[These are probably the only reviews Raworth has written, beyond the cutup
in _Outburst_ 1.  If you can track these down you'll earn a huge thankyou.]

London Art Review for Das Kunstwerk, Baden, Germany, during 1964.

 Book reviews for Peace News, London, during 1967: as follows:
March 1967: rev. of _Ferdydurke_ & _Pornographia_ (Witold Gombrowicz)
April 1967: rev. of _The Shoshoneans_ (Dorn)
August 1967: rev. of _The William Carlos Williams Reader_

She is a color. Behind all traffic, a blurt of
quietude in loading docks; men lift here, sweat, fill
their muscles with the air of her normalcy. Bach in a
G-string causals lacerating protrusions. Yes, you
mouth, I have your hand there.

















A clarity of fog etches contrast on the city, which,
after days of cloudy pounding, was in danger of
wartime recession. Cesspool-hopping in clatter hoops
vents grooved ears back to fangful smile; cats could
be a type of music, a ribbon of melody tying your legs
so lightly together it helps you walk. In the morning
she thinks about the elderly, especially about the
rude old men who secrete disrespect begrudgingly;
predictably, dogwood strips white in the rain, hanging
behind your eyes long after slumber is done fumbling
at your zipper. What sleep sucks from you deeply is
not important. Only those institutions who as a matter
of policy suspirate gradient undulations may catch
wind of new styles of containment.





















As much as you suspect her cleanliness is hot in the
center, fire in all its rude forms wrings essence from
quickly withering food. In my napalm closet, mist
courses through mopheads with a vapid rinse;  cars,
peeling electricity from crudely fusion engines, rove
around volcanic corners with all the speed those old
barbershop towels save in shaving. Every night I wash
my face in the same dirty bowl; every evening she
stares back at me: surprised so many angles come
pristine.

















I'm not picky about dreaming of car crash. Letting
this happen, along the sides of our sighs cerulean
patterns of sex. The wheels rattle, the hubcaps
wheeze, in your new job you do not matter. Most
importantly, it communicates emotion.

there is not that much difference between "theory" (ideas
compellingly expressed) and "poetry" (ideas compellingly expressed).
however, at the level of people not very good at it, there is a great
difference between "theory" (boring jargon in clunky sentences) and
"poetry" (images and statements about feelings).

of the below, i agree with #2 and, most especially, #6. otherwise,
these seem to contradict #2, and judge as somehow defective people

This reminds me of the charges leveled at LangPo, that the theoretical
writing was interesting while the poetry that emerged from it was bland. It
lacked salt.

Vincent, thanks for sending this to the list.

Empiricism? "Some isolated fact torn from the unity and integrity of
its ideological context" [to which] "no cognitive value whatever
adheres." (Filosofija jazyka)

Now, the separation of the attribute and reflexive reversal into
false/true demonstrates an immersion in an analytical language (such
as englisc) when in a synthetic language (OE for example), there is a
freer word order and more nominative building, so can "False
empiricism" be read also as a nominative unit?

Language reflexes. What impulse produced the insistence that the
construct had to be adj/noun when a reader from another language might
read it purely nominatively? That reflex has to be learned, drilled.

Why ask philosophy to answer a question about "passion" when it is
philosophy that looks to poetry for the passion shattering of the
mediated,
always mediated (language) world?

Does Negri's article express the desperation of European philosophy to
locate an origin when that philosophy wants to burst out of all
origins?

What writing is capable of inhabiting mass incinerations? What if it
is a cognitive language? Somebody on nettime the other night writing
30 million dead in WWII when people always tell me no, it was more
like 25 million here (20 million is the typical statistic).

There is a moment of authentic empiricism, How many million died,
around the world, in WWII? Does it matter? Or what is it just matter?

Hi Ram

how did you like that CD I gave you? (I know there are
a couple of Enya-moments towards the end--I kept
telling Doug "I think there's too much reverb in this
one" and he kept saying "No, no it sounds great!")

anyhow, I'm interested to hear your reactions,

Kazim

Fascinating discussion. My dissertation is, in part, on the intersections
of cognitive science and poetry - what I'm calling "neuropoetics" (nice to
know that Joel Weishaus has arrived at a similar term for his beautiful &
complex work "neuropoesis" - thanks for that link, Joel!).

States with his family in 1945.  He joined the faculty of the English
Department here at Berkeley in 1970.  He is the editor of a volume of essay=
s
by William Carlos Williams, The Embodiment of Knowledge, and the author of
six volumes of poetry (including Watermelons, L=92Autre, Goat Dances and Meat

This endlessly elaborating poem
Displays the theory of poetry,
As the life of poetry.  A more severe,

More harassing master would extemporize
Subtler, more urgent proof that the theory
Of poetry is the theory of life,

As it is, in the infinite evasions of as,
In things seen and unseen, created from nothingness,
The heavens, the hells, the worlds, the longed-for lands.

can you share some references with the list, Camille?  I think this is a
fast developing area but i haven't seen much in the neurosciences here
beyond faxcination with the pretty pictures.  is this related to the work

Bush's "Christian" Blood Cult---Concerns Raised by the Vatican

George W. Bush proclaims himself a born-again Christian. However, Bush
and fellow self-anointed neo-Christians like House Majority Leader Tom
DeLay, John Ashcroft, and sports arena Book of Revelations carnival
hawker Franklin Graham appear to wallow in a "Christian" blood lust cult
when it comes to practicing the teachings of the founder of
Christianity. This cultist form of Christianity, with its emphasis on
death rather than life, is also worrying the leaders of mainstream
Christian religions, particularly the Pope.

One only has to check out Bush's record as Governor of Texas to see his
own preference for death over life. During his tenure as Governor, Bush
presided over a record setting 152 executions, including the 1998
execution of fellow born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted
murderer who later led a prison ministry. Forty of Bush's executions
were carried out in 2000, the year the Bush presidential campaign was
spotlighting their candidate's strong law enforcement record. The
Washington Post's Richard Cohen reported in October 2000 that one of the
execution chamber's "tie-down team" members, Fred Allen, had to prepare
so many people for lethal injections during 2000, he quit his job in
disgust.

Bush mocked Tucker's appeal for clemency. In an interview with Talk
magazine, Bush imitated Tucker's appeal for him to spare her life -
pursing his lips, squinting his eyes, and in a squeaky voice saying,
"Please don't kill me." That went too far for former GOP presidential
candidate Gary Bauer, himself an evangelical Christian. "I think it is
nothing short of unbelievable that the governor of a major state
running for president thought it was acceptable to mock a woman he
decided to put to death," said Bauer.

A former Texas Department of! Public Safety officer, a devout Roman
Catholic, told this reporter that evidence to the contrary, Bush was
more
than happy to ignore DNA data and documented cases of prosecutorial
misconduct to send innocent people to the Huntsville, Texas lethal
injection chamber. He said the number of executed mentally retarded,
African Americans, and those who committed capital crimes as minors was
proof that Bush was insensitive and a "phony Christian." When faced with
similar problems in Illinois, Governor George Ryan, a Republican,
commuted the death sentences of his state's death row inmates and
released others after discovering they were wrongfully convicted. Yet
the Republican Party is pillorying Ryan and John Ashcroft's Justice
Department continues to investigate the former Governor for political
malfeasance as if Bush and Ashcroft are without sin in such matters.
Hypocrisy certainly rules in the Republican Party.

Bush's blood lust has been extended across the globe. He has given the
CIA authority to assassinate those deemed a threat to U.S. national
interests. Bush has virtually suspended Executive Orders 11905 (Gerald
Ford), 12306 (Jimmy Carter), and 12333 (Ronald Reagan) which prohibit
the assassination of foreign leaders. Bush's determination to kill
Saddam Hussein, his family, and his top leaders with precision-guided
missiles and tactical nuclear weapon-like Massive Ordnance Air Blast
(MOAB) bombs is yet another indication of Bush's disregard for his
Republican and Democratic predecessors. It now appears that in his zeal
to kill Hussein, innocent civilian patrons of a Baghdad restaurant were
killed by one of Bush's precision Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs).
Like it or not, Saddam Hussein was recognized by over 100 nations as the
leader of Iraq -- a member state of the United Nations. Hussein, like
North Korea's Kim Jong Il, Syria's Bashir Assad, and Iran's Mohammed
Khatami, are covered by Executive Order 12 333, which the Bush
mouthpieces claim is s ill in effect. Bush's "Christian" blood cult sees
no other option than death for those who become his enemies. This
doctrine is found no place in Christian theology.

Bush has not once prayed for the innocent civilians who died as a result
of the U.S. attack on Iraq. He constantly "embeds" himself with the
military at Goebbels-like speech fests and makes constant references to
God when he refers to America's "victory" in Iraq, as if God endorses
his sordid killing spree. He makes no mention of the children, women,
and old men killed by America's "precision-guided" missiles and bombs
and trigger-happy U.S. troops. In fact, Bush revels in indiscriminate
blood letting. Since he never experienced such killing in Southeast
Asia, when he was AWOL from his Texas Air National Guard unit, Bush just
does not seem to understand the horror
of a parent watching one's children having their heads and limbs blown
off in a sudden blast of shrapnel or children witnessing their parents
burning to death with their own body fat nurturing the flames.

Bush and his advisers, previously warned that Iraq's ancient artifacts
and collection of historical documents and books were in danger of being
looted or destroyed, instead, sat back while the Baghdad and Mosul
museums and Baghdad Library were ransacked and destroyed. Cult leaders
have historically attempted to destroy history in order to invent their
own. The Soviets tried to obliterate Russia's Orthodox traditions,
turning a number of churches into warehouses and animal barns.



Cambodia's Pol Pot tried to wipe out Buddhism's famed Angkor Wat shrine
in an attempt to stamp out his country's Buddhist history. In March
2001, while they were negotiating with the Bush administration on a
natural gas pipeline, Afghanistan's Taliban blew up two massive
1600-year old Buddhas in Bamiyan. The Bush administration, itself run by
fanatic religious cultists, barely made a fuss about the loss of the
relics. It would not be the first time the cultists within the Bush
administration ignored the pillaging of history's treasures.

The ransacking of Iraq's historical treasures is explainable when one
considers what the blood cult Christians really think about Islam.
Franklin Graham, the heir to the empire built up by his anti-Semitic
father, Billy Graham, has decided being anti-Muslim is far more
financially rewarding than being anti-Jewish. Billy Graham, history
notes from the Nixon tapes, complained about the Jewish stranglehold on
the media and Jews being responsible for pornography.

Franklin Graham continues to enjoy his father's unfettered and
questionable access to the White House. But in the case of Bush, the
younger Graham has a fanatic adherent. Graham has called Islam a "very
evil and wicked" religion. He then announces he wants to go to Iraq.
Graham obviously sees an opportunIty to convert Muslims and unrepentant
Eastern Christians, who owe their allegiance to Roman and Greek
prelates, to his perverted form of blood cult Christianity. Graham says
he is ready to send his Samaritan's Purse missionaries into Iraq to
provide assistance. Muslims and mainstream Christians are wary that
Graham wants to exchange food, water, and medicine for the baptism of
Iraqis into his intolerant brand of Christianity. In the last Gulf War,
Graham could not get away with his chicanery. The Desert Storm
Commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, stopped dead in the tracks
Graham's plan to send 30,000 Arabic language Bibles to U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia. Today's Pentagon shows no such compunction to put a rein
on Graham. It invited him to give a Good Friday sermon at the Pentagon
to the consternation of the Defense Department's Muslim employees. To
make matters worse, under Bush's "Faith Based Initiative,"
Graham'sSamaritan's Purse stands to receive U.S. government funds for it
s proselytizing efforts in Iraq, something that should be an affront to
every American taxpayer.

Bush's self-proclaimed adherence to Christianity (during one of the
presidential debates he said Jesus Christ was his favorite
"philosopher") and his constant reference to a new international
structure bypassing the United Nations system and long-standing
international treaties are worrying the top leadership of the Roman
Catholic Church. Well-informed sources close to the Vatican report that
Pope John Paul II is growing increasingly concerned about Bush's
ultimate intentions. The Pope has had experience with Bush's death
fetish. Bush ignored the Pope's plea to spare the life of Karla Faye
Tucker. To show that he was similarly ignorant of the world's mainstream
religions, Bush also rejected an appeal to spare Tucker from the World
Council of Churches - an organization that represents over 350 of the
world's Protestant ! and Orthodox Churches. It did not matter that
Bush's own Methodist Church and his parents' Episcopal Church are
members of the World Council.

Bush's blood lust, his repeated commitment to Christian beliefs, and his
constant references to "evil doers," in the eyes of many devout
Catholic leaders, bear all the hallmarks of the one warned about in the
Book of Revelations - the anti-Christ. People close to the Pope claim
that amid these concerns, the Pontiff wishes he was younger and in
better health to confront the possibility that Bush may represent the
person prophesized in Revelations. John Paul II has always believed the
world was on the precipice of the final confrontation between Good and
Evil as foretold in the New Testament. Before he became Pope, Karol
Cardinal Wojtyla said, "We are now standing in the face of the greatest
historical confrontation humanity has gone through. I do not think that
wide circles of the American society or wide circles of the Christian
community realize this fully. We are now facing the final confrontation
between the Church and the anti-Church, of the Gospel
versus the anti-Gospel." The Pope, who grew up facing the evils of
Hitler and Stalin, knows evil when he sees it. Although we can all
endlessly argue over the Pope's effectiveness in curtailing abuses
within his Church, his accomplishments external to Catholicism are
impressive.

According to journalists close to the Vatican, the Pope and his closest
advisers are also concerned that the ultimate acts of evil - the
September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon -
were known in advance by senior Bush administration officials. By
permitting the attacks to take their course, there is a perception
within the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy that a coup d'etat was
implemented, one that gave Bush and his leadership near-dictatorial
powers to carry out their agenda.

The Pope worked tirelessly to convince leaders of nations on the UN
Security Council to oppose Bush's war resolution on Iraq. Vatican
sources claim they had not seen the Pope more animated and determined
since he fell ill to Parkinson's Disease. In the end, the Pope
did convince the leaders of Mexico, Chile, Cameroon, and Guinea to
oppose the U.S. resolution. If one were to believe in the Book of
Revelations, as the Pope fervently does, he can seek solace in scoring a
symbolic victory against the Bush administration. Whether Bush
represents a dangerous right-wing ideologue who couples his political
fanaticism with a neo-Christian blood cult (as I believe) or he is
either the anti-Christ or heralds one, the Pope should know he has
fought the good battle and has gained the respect and admiration of many
non-Catholics around the world.

Not sure I'm even close to being "on-topic" here, but re: Michael Magee's
comments


<<Language reflexes. What impulse produced the insistence that the construct
had to be adj/noun when a reader from another language might read it purely
nominatively? That reflex has to be learned, drilled.
Why ask philosophy to answer a question about "passion" when it is
philosophy that looks to poetry for the passion shattering of the mediated,
always mediated (language) world?
Does Negri's article express the desperation of European philosophy to
locate an origin when that philosophy wants to burst out of all origins?>>

And I may be repeating thoughts, mostly, but I think it's particularly
simple: There are all these neurons, connections, in the brain, particularly
the ones between the two hemispheres at the corpus callosum.

<<"I have read several articles and other research. It has supposedly been
proven that ambidextrous people have larger corpus collosum- the bundle of
nerve fibers joining the right and left sides of the brain. Is this true? I
have also encountered enough information saying that you can learn to become
bidextrous that I accept it. Would encouraging children to use both hands
ultimately enlarge their brain power or would it just lower their overall
intelligence?"
http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/dec2001/1008947611.Ns.q.html>>
And corpus callosum:
http://www.vh.org/adult/provider/anatomy/BrainAnatomy/Ch5Text/Section21.html

They're firing all the time--because, well, the animal is alive, so the
nerve cells, like others, are doing their biochemical thing(s)--and they're
different for each unique person (except, perhaps, the neocons, who are more
like robots, as that is what their collective weltanschauung believes in and
commits to). The neurons especially fire during "stressful times" (both
"positive" and "negative"), for, again, we're animals, and the body/mind is
doing its thing(s), including processing the firing "pre-emotion" and
"pre-cognition."  This latter processing, in response to great sadness,
frustration, pleasure, intellectual delight, scientific discovery joy, or
just plain the individual's nearly billions of neurons firing requires
synthesis that will calm down the body/mind, and that synthesis is derived
from artistic and intellectual activity particularly; that is, the calming
down cannot happen, in the case of poets, for example, until a new
arrangement of language makes the "wanting/pining" neurons happy and
satisfied.  Poets, having more of these neurons, have more cause to arrange
language originally; by golly, they have more "sense," more "emotion," that
cannot be dealt with until it is, via words, somehow mirrored from the
neurons.  I'm saying that the richness and the "understanding" and the
getting a handling on the emotion cannot finally be accessed and processed
until language makes it "palpable" and "concrete" and thus "physically
existing."  For poets, at least, language arranging is the only means by
which these complex and insistent neuronal/biochemical/emotional/cognitive
pressures can get closure.

Also, "more" (neuronal connections, females vs. males, poets vs. neocons,
etc) is neither "necessarily better" nor more significant.  Each individual
is different and unique and contributes to the dynamic collective
unconscious of the species and its collective genetic code (for survival)
and light in the universe that is our planet's life force.  A brain injured
person, for example, may have neurons reduced by 100 fold but still would be
doing "processing" that produces his/her own unique "light," as it were.
Are poets, generally, more inclined to use language, though, because, again,
maybe they have more of these connections between right and left brain and
thus more "emotion" that must be "worded" into existence (processed)?  Is it
nothing but brain noise or painful static, otherwise?

Last, the neocons, perhaps threatened by "extinction" of their genetic
contribution's 20,000 year participation, may be making their last great
"spike" to preserve their types of neuronal wiring, thus their crazy,
desperate violence and control madness.  It's extremely dangerous, of
course, because they could take the entire planet down with their final
spasms and the terror, the "poundingly alarming brain static," compelling
them to act so extremely.  The world is now overcrowded.  More to the point,
though, its much more complex and diverse (even Pound and Milton together
couldn't read all the books if they were alive today?).  Their habitual and
(for them) most reliable "way" of dealing with the greatly increased static
and noise is to try and force everything into black and white terms (not
unlike my gibberish here?), "processing" that may certainly NOT be effective
"adaptation," so their tribe is panicking.  This is no different than a
person psychologically overwhelmed going berserk and causing great
destruction to all around by his/her gone-berserk actions, except, of
course, it's increased exponentially by the greater numbers and combinations
of craziness.

Anyway, though, I believe a good deal of corpus callosum wiring and
disposition is wired in and, following Eisler (The Chalice and the Blade)
http://www.disinfo.com/pages/dossier/id296/pg1, and putting a few other 2's
and 2's together, I think the cultural/sociopolitical "war" may be
inevitable as the population reaches the boiling points.  It's wired into
our genetic code?  Or, actually, what's wired in makes one define it as a
binary "tug of life?"   The "cooperation model" and the "competition model"
is not really a real dichotomy?  It's a false dichotomy?   The dichotomy is
actually more a function of one's resources for percieving it and in fact
the species favors "cooperation" overall, which "includes" seeing things in
terms of a cooperation/competition tug of war?  Play?  It's up to "our side"
to determine just how "bloody" the conflict will be?

 More 2 cents,

The animus I referred to was limited to the kind of debate Steven Pinker and Stephen Rose had a few years ago at London University's Insitution of Education, an event
generated to drive sales more than to arrive at consensus; certainly what little sense I have of the collaboration between legitimate researchers seems much more
amicable, it's true. Still, while some of these figures might be popularizers who have little to do with the inner sanctum of lab work, others such as Gerald M. Edelman and
Giulio Tononi (co-authors of A Universe of Consciousness; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465013775/qid=1051125722/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-2644077-
4470559?v=glance&s=books) have been up to their elbows in empirical research (Edelman won the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1972 for discovering the chemical
structures of antibodies) and many of the ideas they outline are still under contention; for example, the concept of "reentry," or the mutual feedback between various neural
areas that provides the linkages in our conscious minds, has not been widely accepted as far as I know. The theory proposes the existence of a dynamic core, or an unity of
constantly changing neural connections, and in articulation, this seems much closer to the Buddhist notion that there is no essential self (if that might be considered a faith-
based speculation) than to computational theories of mind. The fact that there is a decrease in the activity of the parietal lobes of Tibetan monks is no burning bush, and yet
that phyisological alteration is inseparable from the "faith" that compels them to sitting practice.

The only question I wanted to raise is whether the most detailed and intricate investigation of neurobiology will help explain why and how we experience private qualia or
whether that realm, for all intensive purposes, is closed to the brain sciences and thus sanctioned for that other science of reality, poetry.

BTW - I'd love to see such a chart as you mention as it would be far more revealing than a lit theory indeed:

> Has anybody charted what gets fired in the brain when somebody is reading a rich,
> complex poem? I think that this would reveal far more about the poetic
> experience than what most of today's academic literary theorists have to

I was wondering if a list of those who bought all objects can be procured at some place, and what
objects that were bought.  I'm particularly intrigued to see who got his books, and what prices they
went at, particularly editions that were signed over to him by former surrealists such as Philippe
Soupault and Gherasim Luca.  Some of these may have been affordable!  What will Breton's daughter do

Birthplace


Small, divided
to fit my palm,
not wholly given up
yet ready to be

Whenever I'm touched

on memory's sometime

Dearth of sky

Dear fellow peace activist/artist,

My name is Jim Mann, I am an American graphic designer living in
Barcelona, Spain.

Here in Barcelona, the anti-war movement is very strong and
demonstrations against the war in Iraq are being held daily.

This war is different in many ways. Beside the fact that virtually the
whole world community is against it, there has been an overwhelming
display by the people in the streets holding various anti-war posters.
Some of the posters have images and messages that are serious, others
use humor and satire to get their points across.

My goal is to put together some of the best posters from around the
world. Even if the book is published after the war ends, the messages
from these posters will live on into history, and that is one of the
goals of producing this book.

I am aware that many of you are very busy with organizing events and
recruiting people, but I ask for a few minutes of your time to send me
artwork either through email or by post.

Names of artists and organizations will be credited appropriately

The book will be printed at A3 (european tabloid size) and shall include
130 to 150 images color or black and white.

A portion of the Profits from the sale of the book will go to those
peace organizations who submit artwork, or to organizations which the
artists themselves choose.

Also organizations will be able to sell the book on their web sites or
at peace rallies or meetings. All images in the book will be copyright
free and available for individual use by the purchaser of the book.

Submissions can be in the form of printed paper or on cd-rom or floppy
diskette.
digital format: .eps, .jpeg, .pdf  adobe illustrator, photoshop, quark
express etc.
size: at least 11x17 or A3
resolution: 150 to 300 dpi

Deadline for submissions is June 1st 2003

Please mail submissions to:

Jim Mann
c/Duana 3,  1-1
08003 Barcelona
Spain

or email artwork to mann@opus5.info

Thankyou very much for your time, I look forward to receiving artwork
from you very soon. Please pass this email along to other interested
parties.

Peace,

Jim Mann

Astonishing Art Work Stops Traffic at Piccadilly Circus

(Gothic News Service, 5/23/03) This morning  - at the busy rush-hour
crossroad traffic around Piccadilly Circus - foot, bus and commercial
traffic were brought to a stand still by the sight of four coffin sized
aquarium tanks, each elevated on metal stands directly below the famous
roundabout=B9s statue of Eros. Carefully spaced and diagonally situated to
face each other, the aquariums at first appeared to be another
sensationalist sculptural work by Damian Hirst. However, instead of a lamb,
a shark, or a cow=B9s head suspended in formaldehyde, a much different sight
hypnotically stopped pedestrians and vehicles alike.  Naked mannequins of
President George Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair lay face up, suspended
in pale green liquid, both figures centered between the aquarium=B9s
transparent glass walls. Ironically, what appeared to be anatomical hearts
were floated suspended towards the top of the tank, each held by a single
thick artery attached to the cavity inside of each of the men=B9s chests, bot=
h
of which appeared to have been surgically opened.

In the other two aquariums =AD each at adjoining angles to those of the
President and the Prime Minister =AD the contents were quite dissimilar. Also
similarly suspended and frozen in pale green liquid, one contained another
figure apparently tilted to face the street. It appeared to be an adult
male, however one made difficult to identify because of the absence of a
head, its neck area tightly covered over with a dark scarf. The rest of the
body lay dressed in a loose blue tank-top, light gray, black oil smeared
trousers and black flip-flops. Sharp red flesh wounds haphazardly appeared
over exposed areas of the figure=B9s shoulders, arms and feet.

Curiously the other aquarium did not contain a body, but the model of an
upright, golden harp, one with nine vertical strings, similar to those
played in the courts of ancient Sumeria. In the angle of the morning sun =AD
even through the density of the formaldehyde - the singular harp appeared
particularly radiant, invoking an ironic sense of absent royalty and song.

Pedestrians who were able to get close enough to the works discovered each
aquarium to be meticulously subtitled with inlaid inscriptions on each of
the metal tank frames. Under the figures of Bush and Blair, viewers could
read an enigmatic, perhaps haunting phrase:

      I Don=B9t Speak German.

The words under the headless, dressed figure were a little more obvious:

      Unknown Iraqi Civilian. Cluster.

Under the golden harp there was a simple phrase, perhaps more difficult to
immediately interpret, a seeming exhortation:

      Lament for the Makers.

At first the immediate crowd appeared stunned by the content of the works
and then variously sad and furious. "Is this supposed to be us?" many asked
while others resisted, "This is not us," repeating it over and over again,
as if in disbelief that anybody would do this. Occasionally, a particularly
angry person yelled out, "Why not Hussein? Why not Hussein?"

It took more than a hour for London=B9s Bobbies to break up the crowd and
carry the works away in a Yard van for booking as evidence, and that still
without any knowledge of the perpetrator. Indeed some of crowd argued
whether or not the work was by Damian Hirst and how or why he could have
gone "this far."
 =20
"I cannot imagine Hirst being foolish enough to make this kind of career
move," a man with a kind of knowing authority spoke. "His work, as the
critics say, might be into interrupting urban boredom, but this kind of
publicity will kill him. Rich collectors, politically conservative as most
of them are =AD unless maybe they are Arabs - will just say no way."

"It's hard to believe anyone can be this cynical," someone added. "The Iraq
invasion and Occupation is just not this bad."

It took hours for normal traffic to resume at Piccadilly. In fact, the rest
of the morning London=B9s Bobbies worked themselves to pull down dozens of
climbers down from holding on to the wings of Eros.

A few of us in Seattle are planning a rather special protest on Saturday:

________________________

Saturday, April 26th, 12pm-2:00pm,
Seattle Art Museum, downtown site

Artists and others will gather to mourn the casualties and loss of life in
Iraq, as well as the looting and destruction of various Iraqi cultural
institutions. We also grieve the many acts of "looting" being done by the
American government.

Please dress in black funeral attire and meet under "Looting Man" (aka
Hammering Man, the Jonathon Borofsky sculpture outside the main entrance on
1st Avenue) at 12 o'clock sharp. We will proceed in silence around the
museum block for two hours.

No signs, no chants, no coffins. We are sympathetic mourners, slowly walking
together around the museum. With enough of us, we can encircle the museum/
block entirely. It is an act of grief and we are the (symbolic) missing ring
of protection.

A simple flyer explaining the action will be given to interested on-lookers.

Please, PLEASE pass the word along and feel free to print and Xerox this
e-mail.
______________________

Two hours might be a bit much! Still, the reason I'm forwarding this is to
try and provoke some interest from artists and writers in other cities to
perform a similar action. Perhaps the sizable contingent of poets in New
York City on this list might want to gather around the Metropolitan Museum
at noon. People in L.A. might choose the L.A. county museum on Wilshire.
Etc.

It would be a shame, after all the energies of mobilization provoked by the
war, to simply retreat to our various hermeticisms. We need to find new ways
-- poetic, artistic, and on the streets -- to say "no" to this most
repellent of administrations and all its plans.

Tom Bell & others interested:

Here are a few sources for those interested in cognitive science & its
interdisiplinary applications. The literature is _enormous_, so this is
only a tiny sampling!

Also, if anyone would like the link to my online dissertation, which deals
in part with "neuropoetics," please backchannel. I just gave a talk for
Small Press Traffic in San Francisco: "Poetry on the Brain, or, My
Homunculus, the Poet." Hopefully it will be published at some point.

I've found Lakoff & Johnson particularly helpful in thinking about the
conjuctions of linguistics and cognitive science.

The physical side of cognition suggests, I think, an interest in
phemonemenology & embodied consciousness. As Lewis LaCook suggested,
Merleau-Ponty is a pivotal thinker in this respect, and in many ways
constructs bridges between philosophy and cognitive science. _The Visible
and Invisible_ sounds poetic at times, as if he's struggling for a new
language to express the leveling of the field of subject/object relations
and perception, and a dismantling of Cartesian modes of cognition & what he
disparagingly calls "high-altitude thinking."

I'm also particularly interested in the intersections of cognitive science
and Buddhism, and Varela is helpful here. There's a big tome on the subject
called _Zen and the Brain_, which I vow some day to read! If anyone knows
of an analysis of the ancient Indian Buddhist Nagarjuna from a cogsci
perspective, please tell me!

you set off, with sword.  Innocent girl, she dropped
whilst she dares not speak
nor has the words for what she wants to say.  She
says,
very softly, "And I was very wedding morn.

Hidden emperor flavor be somewhat the weaker."

I received yesterday fifty emails saying
there is a carefully written tragic legend.
Now how can that be.

The infamies that exist today
in capitalistic society are fast becoming
a species that has progressed beyond
the bounds of history,
written on the back of God's palm.

It may be part of the formulaic style of
every single soul at the bottom beyond infinity,
or it may be a concession to a twelfth-
century audience familiar with
awakening

in the same way that one recites in class
without any thought to the words.

Intricate tissue of myth and reality
once was fed even some of the so-called
shadows of the pines, now starves.

She wants those concerning herself
to blossom forth!
Sadly, she turned around and left the store.
I cried after reading it, entitled "Saint Antichrist,"
without comment or signature

He hit himself saying, "Fie on me!"
Task is done. Boo as hard as you can.

>I was hoping someone could be more specific.  What specific styles,
techniques, methods, forms, diction, whatever, has theory contributed to
contemporary poetry?  Are these good?  Why?
>
>Let me indulge my skepticism for a sec (as if I ever do anything else).
Take a book such as _My Life_.  Now, I find this work punishingly boring.
Others don't.  Fine.  But, based on my recollection, which may not be
accurate, correct me if I'm wrong, it seems to me that one *might* say that
Hejinian owes just about everything to Stein and other modernist poets, and
that her debt to theory is not really visible on the page.  And perhaps,
risking another possibly insipid assertion, one could say that what is
usually taken to be "experimental" writing today likewise owes 99% of its
styles, techniques, mannerisms, etc., to modernist models.  (Re-read
Kenner's chapter on "Words Set Free" in _The Pound Era_ if you need to
remind yourself just how little difference there is, formally, between what
Williams was doing in _Spring And All_ and what scads of young poets are
doing today.  And how much better Williams was, too, of course.)
>
>So, if all theory has done is to encourage poets to think that imitating
Stein or some other traditional poet will give their work philosophical or
political bite, then theory has not done much more for poetry than
re-certify (within the academy at least) certain models for literary
imitation.  OR?

.Here's a recent overview of
Pennebaker's work:
*Pennebaker, J.W. (2002). What our words can say about us: Toward a broader
language psychology. Psychological Science Agenda, 15, 8-9. A brief and
light summary of recent findings concerning the power of words in revealing
personality and social situations.  and this:
*Pennebaker, J.W. & Stone, L.D. (in press).  Words of wisdom:  Language use
over the lifespan.  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.  As people
age, the words they use in everyday language changes.  This is based on
analysis of over 3000 individuals writing about emotional topics and the
collected works of 10 famous authors

I'm really looking for something that shows how different areas of the brain
are lit up by oral versus written poetry?  My guess is that the oral is
closer tied to emotional areas than written which tends to be cognitive or
rational?

How and where the two are 'linked' is really what makes poetry, though. I
would think.

I think another issue worth exploring would relate to the 'action' of poetry
in the sense that cognitive explanations tend to be about or theoretical
rather than dynamic or action oriented and tend to explore the geography of
mind as if that explains how anything 'happens'

not yet a crazy old man
hard but not yet hardening of the
arteries as there are still some sparks going on down

No, haven't seen, but I am scratching its surface as I write!

Are you familiar with Joseph McElroy's Plus? For some reason your work here

LOS HIJOS DE MARCOS JOYA

Los hijos de Marcos Joya mueren sin medicina,
escuelas no hay para lo de Ricardo Reyes,
ni los ancianos puedan alimentarse
pero Samoza tiene armas modernisimas para matar.

The children of Marcos Joya are dying for lack of medicine,

ARCHIPIELAGO DE VERDES ISLAS

Archipielago de verdes islas
con bandadas de patos buceando junto a lost corrales de piedras
bajo los frondosos guabos.
En mayo lost guises construyen sus nidos
con las primeras lluvias brillan en las noche los hachones
y se comienza a sembrar el maiz.
Los dias son calmos
hace much calor.


ARCHIPELAGO OF GREEN ISLANDS**

Archipelago of green islands
with flocks of ducks diving in stony coves
under thick-leaved guava trees.
In May the guises build their nests,
when the first rains come torches glow at night
and we start to plant our corn.
The days are calm,
it is very hot.

Dear fellow peace activist/artist,

My name is Jim Mann, I am an American graphic designer living in
Barcelona, Spain.

Here in Barcelona, the anti-war movement is very strong and
demonstrations against the war in Iraq are being held daily.

This war is different in many ways. Beside the fact that virtually the
whole world community is against it, there has been an overwhelming
display by the people in the streets holding various anti-war posters.
Some of the posters have images and messages that are serious, others
use humor and satire to get their points across.

My goal is to put together some of the best posters from around the
world. Even if the book is published after the war ends, the messages
from these posters will live on into history, and that is one of the
goals of producing this book.

I am aware that many of you are very busy with organizing events and
recruiting people, but I ask for a few minutes of your time to send me
artwork either through email or by post.

Names of artists and organizations will be credited appropriately

The book will be printed at A3 (european tabloid size) and shall include
130 to 150 images color or black and white.

A portion of the Profits from the sale of the book will go to those
peace organizations who submit artwork, or to organizations which the
artists themselves choose.

Also organizations will be able to sell the book on their web sites or
at peace rallies or meetings. All images in the book will be copyright
free and available for individual use by the purchaser of the book.

Submissions can be in the form of printed paper or on cd-rom or floppy
diskette.
digital format: .eps, .jpeg, .pdf  adobe illustrator, photoshop, quark
express etc.
size: at least 11x17 or A3
resolution: 150 to 300 dpi

Deadline for submissions is June 1st 2003

Please mail submissions to:

Jim Mann
c/Duana 3,  1-1
08003 Barcelona
Spain

or email artwork to mann@opus5.info

Thankyou very much for your time, I look forward to receiving artwork
from you very soon. Please pass this email along to other interested
parties.

Peace,

Jim Mann

Kevin,

You might also be interested in this guy, Dan Moonhawk, a reformed
Chompskian (??-Chompskyite??). Once you get through the autobiography, he's
got some interesting ideas about the morphemic value of phonemes.

This site offers a clever parody (on several levels) of the kind of theorizing
that may be ending. Note that the prose is generated by a computer program,
"the Dada engine, a system for generating random text from recursive grammars."
Are graduate schools still producing similar engines, in the form of budding
young scholars?

Hello,

       I've been to every march in SF since October and have shot dozens of
rolls of anti-war signage, most very good.  I plan to edit the photos with
the help of the art historian T.J. Clark and some other friends here in
Berkeley.  Someone will have to do the scanning.
       How many would you want?

Robert Bly in his book Leaping Poetry tried to build a theory based on David
MacLean's Tri-Une Brain theory that great poetry is a leap between the
neo-cortex and the limbic system (rational and instinctive parts of the brain).
The book is probably dated in terms of the cognitive map that MacLean offers
(his book was published in the early seventies, and Bly's book is now probably
two decades old at least).

There have been lots of studies by neuroscientists who can now track what parts
of the brain are firing when a pianist plays at a large concert hall.  It does
seem to be a link between these two parts of mind that MacLean (I think that's
his name) calls neocortex and limbic.

It's apparently more rare for men to be able to make this leap than women.
We're hard-wired differently.  Bly argues that if you get used to making the
leap you'll make a royal road between the two, and that poetry has a great
importance in our culture because it is an attempt to build this royal road.

This is maybe the direction of evolution -- women (and men) want their lovers to
be versed in poetry -- and if so there's a green light -- so therefore it seems
to be an evolutionarily favored activity.  Poetry does appear to be part of the
mating ritual at this point -- perhaps because it points to something that we
want in mates -- the ability to negotiate the impasse between logic (neocortex)
and instinct (limbic), as one without the other is incredibly dull.

But few can do it.  Bly claims this is why there are so few poets, but the few
we have we place so high.  He claims they're building a new path in our brains.

Unbearable, the writing bearing the pressure of the material being
read. Research material uncited indicting. What was she reading, the
source, the authority for the material she was reading, studies found
somewhere that could not have been hard to find in the library for
the one who was writing, mechanically at first, exposition, reciting,
when the affect from the reading began to affect the writing, reading,
writing. Somebody had been studying the condemned. Some book or
another had studied their death. What had been what was being.
Cellblock. Twenty-four hour surveillance. Isolation. Regulation. The
writing repeated another language, its discursive distancing
mechanisms repeating with difference the difference made, emoting. The
subject made a difference to the one writing from the book from the
library that said at the time of the execution the prisoner is already
dead, she wrote, reciting the words from the book, withdrawal,
passivity, regression among the technical terms taken. The camera, the
always-present camera, and monitored the one being monitored must know
they are monitored, their bodily functions no longer belong to
them. Their bodies no longer belong to them. Their bodies belong to
the state's remote, delegated procedures. They die, the book said,
they are dead before they are executed. This must have been what
overwhelmed the writing, one page's typing going off the margins,
erratic punctuation marks, sparks, maybe some anger. Then despair
returned and the paper ended at the assigned numbered pages turned in
on time. But there'd been time enough for tracing the technique for
evacuating being from the bodies of those marked by the state for
execution. Being can be reduced to matter. Being can be reduced to
matter when science and technology are applied to it. Everyone can
understand this. Everyone can stand this. For as long at least as they
are reading far away from the subject condition of the one subjected
to this regime. Discourse offers such protection, so much protection,
for those compelled to audit the spectacle of the appointed
incineration of the less than. Human? The subject? What was that. It
can't be what it once was, prior to its insertion into machinic
processes. Designs for future architectures of confinement and control
are drawn along these lines. Inside the state, the prisoner, outside
the state, the enemy. But there is no outside to the state that is
everywhere. Everyone not an enemy of the state not prisoner, political
prisoner.

POETRY IS A SEX TOY
AFTER ALL, IT'S A HANDY DEVICE THAT CAN HELP YOU GET LAID

While national poetry month is indeed winding down, it's not too late to
celebrate the power of poetry in your sex life. The way I see it, you have
three options. You can fuck a poet, become one or simply use the poetic
works of others to get yourself laid before month's end. Consider this.
Ninety-nine per cent of all poems are about sex or death, and we could all
stand a little break from the latter. Bottom line: April, month of sonnets
and unfettered free verse, is an awesome time to get yourself some ass. It's
up to you to turn it from the cruellest month into the wettest.

Fucking a poet during Poetry Month is a very nice thing to do because, as
everyone knows, poets are lonely, complicated souls who need more TLC than
most people. At this time of year they may also be suffering from acute
bitterness, especially if they weren't invited to perform their brilliant
works at one of the 200 venues currently featuring readings.

Canada Council rejection letters have arrived by now, so finding a poet
won't be too difficult: simply visit a bar. After a night of hot, grateful
sex, poets will often leave sleazy haikus on the night-table, provided they
leave. Make sure they do. That said, keep all such post-rut love notes. If
your poet fuck becomes famous one day, you can sell his or her scribbled
scrap on eBay for a large sum. (Be patient.)

And if it's your deep wish to be immortalized, elevated from one-night stand
to god/goddess, do sleep with a poet. Like elephants, poets never forget.
Plus, they'll almost always remember you as well endowed.

A person who has devoted his life to creating beauty and obsessing over
rhythm is generally quite good in bed. And because of their notorious talent
for staying up all night, they're less likely to fall asleep on you
mid-romp. Yes, in this our country of bards it is pretty much your patriotic
duty to fuck a poet. (Poets, feel free to carry this column around with you
for the rest of the month, with my sincere hopes that it works like a
charm.)

Option number two: become a poet. If masochism's your thing, go for it. If
not, skip to option three.

When I suggest using the poems of others in order to facilitate a pickup or
seduction, I am not talking about Wordsworth. Dreamily murmuring "I wandered
lonely as a cloud" in a packed bar isn't going to get you any.

Poetry functions best as a courtly weapon, as in the case of the hand-copied
poem in a card or letter. Just remember, whether copied, trilled-out or
whispered, some poets are sexier than others.

If you're disinclined to quote aloud from literature because it's an
undeniably pretentious habit, please note that this is Poetry Month, the one
time of year you can get away with recitations. Or why not copy a few lines
of a truly hot poem on a cocktail napkin and pass it to your object of
desire?

Again, choose carefully. e.e. cummings will get you laid; Robert Frost might
not. (I guess it depends where you hang out on a Friday night.) Anne Sexton
is hotter than Sylvia Plath, but those suicide poets do have a certain hint
of danger about them. Consider using these lines from Canadian poet Lorna
Crozier's suite The Sex Lives Of Vegetables: "Carrots are fucking / the
earth. A permanent / erection, they push deeper / into the damp and dark."
Who wouldn't be enticed by that? Granted, it might work better in a garden
centre than a bar, but you never know.

Whatever you do, make sure to make the most of what's left of Poetry Month
by using poetry in your mating call. Time is of the essence! Make haste! Of
course, you might also choose to enter into the month of May (National
Masturbation Month) alone, holding a copy of Les Fleurs Du Mal in your free
hand. Marnie Woodrow's novel, Spelling Mississippi, features a poet who gets
lucky.

koranic interlude - you can wait on the floor -
there are always times for bodies
i just got this guitar today
so I thought I might use it in the performance.
but then I don't think it would work
since I didn't plan ahead of time for a guitar
but I couldn't resist this one, it cost $40
(that's almost 40 Euros!!!!)
thank yoU! thank you!!!
can you hear me!
thank you!Q thank you!Q
the guitar cost forty Euros -
anyway....
on the left anja schmidt on the right foofwa d'imobilite
foofwa the immobilized -
whenever one moves, there's a relationship with an object
which is a three dimensional cauterization of the real

this is one of those objects - this isn't a joke -
embedded in time and space-varying projections
transforming him into an object - you're seeing the object

oh oh oh I'm beside myself now!
I"M BESIDE MYSELF NOW!
HEHEH!

so anyway - you're seeing the object up there on the screen
- which is in front of me and what if I couldn't type this fast?
I'd be at a loss
becauxe when you work three-dimensionally it's all,
not even object-oriented,
but it's the object itself - it'
s the object itself - going inside and outside of the object -
whatever happened to the body 0-
it moves through violent spaces
        EACH SPACE IS AN ARCHIVE
        EACH SPACE HOLDS ITS OWN AS AN ARCHIVE

SO WHEN YOU STUDY HITTITE
you learn in cuneiform that there are...
strata,l layers, images, viewpoints -
for example, you might want to write MY FATHER
which is my name in hebrew - avi - but you would
use Akkadian - in the middle of the Hittite - you'd
write ABU.YA - like that - you can see the resemblance,
but the hittite's gone, just like it
s gone when sumerian or other forms, mitanni for example,
start to take over - it's ALL a matter of layers and images -
and their destruction - their overt destruction.
what we need is something else - another form/at - for
example the mouth - or a litany of plants and animals
and humans on the way to extinctions...
as plato would say - you get the IDEA....
Kant you understand?
by the way Florian is here, hello Florian! we were waiting...

which reminds me - that there are no end to them,
the protocols and codes and codecs and levelling,
no end at all to them....
so what you're seeing now... flattened images,
collapsed parameters - every image is already an imperialism,
a destruction - every image loses the memory of its creation....
thank you very much for coming and remember
that the war isn't over yet
that people and archives are being destroyed
that no protocol can rescue them
that everything is invaded from within
that i'm playing a guitar with five strings
that the six one is gone as in 'gone world' -

Of course it's much more complex than leaping from the limbic system and the
neocortex, while the limbic system itself consists of many inacting sites.
Bly used MacLean's work to press a psychological, not a neurological, point.
He didn't claim to be versed in neuroscience. MacLean participated in a very
interesting conference, the papers from which were published in A.
Harrington, Editor, "So Human a Brain: Knowledge and Values in the
Neurosciences." Boston, MA., 1992

I've been thinking about how Bly's most recent book, "The Night Abraham
Called to the Stars" displays how this leaping process works in a mature
poet. It's amazing how many risks he is willing to take. It shows how older
poets can be as evocative as younger poets, that creative abilities only
wither if we let them. And this goes to the whole range of one's life. So
that if a poet becomes politically conservative, for example, it will also
stagnant one's willingness to take risks with the poems. This applies to all
creative work, all the arts and sciences. I think you're addressing
creativity not just poety.

Subject:      What is a standing paragraph?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit


Hello list,

I'm doing research on complete, determinate, and singular things and I
cannot seem to get my head around the meaning/usage of the word
'paragraph.'

My understanding of paragraph is 'to divide or arrange,' so that, a
paragraph (by definition) cannot exist as a singular entity, but
requires plurality to exist (i.e. the act of division, to divide).

A paragraph, then, would appear to be similar to 'article,' in that
there must be 'one of several' in order for proper (definitive)
existence.

** So then, what definitively is called a single item of text, of which
there is no more and none before? **

My best guess, to this point, would be a generic term like 'content' or
'text.'

Is there no proper antonym of 'paragraph' in literary terminology?

Any help/thoughts to define this would be appreciated.

You might look at George Lakoff's work on radial categories, and Bruce
Hawkin's articles applying those ideas to grammar. Lakoff argues (I think
convincingly) that categories aren't neat and tidy in the way your question
suggests, that they radiate outward from a typical case prototype evincing
certain central tendencies. Perhaps a more fruitful question would be what
are the central tendencies of the things folks commonly call paragraphs. I
don't think "division" is necessarily the defining trait of the paragraph.

Best,
Joseph

Anselm Hollo was born in Helsinki, Finland, and was educated there and in
the U.S. In his early twenties, he left Finland to live and work as a writer
and translator, first in Germany and Austria, then in London, where he was
employed by the BBC's European Services in their Finnish Program from 1958
to 1967. Translations into Finnish from that time include Allen Ginsberg's
Howl and John Lennon's In His Own Write.
For the last thirty years, Hollo has lived in the United States, teaching
creative writing and literary translation at numerous colleges and
universities, including SUNY Buffalo, The University of Iowa, and The
University of Colorado. He is now Associate Professor in the Graduate
Writing and Poetics Department at The Naropa Institute.
Hollo has published more than thirty-five books and chapbooks, most recently
Corvus (Coffee House Press, 1995) and AHOE (Smokeproof Press, 1997). He has
also translated many contemporary Finnish poets, among them Paavo Haavikko
and Pentti Saarikoski, as well as fiction, plays, and poetry from the
German, French, Swedish, and Finnish.
Hollo's honors and awards include the New York State Creative Artists'
Public Service Award (1976), a National Endowment for the Arts Poet's
Fellowship (1979), the P.E.N./American-Scandinavian Foundation Award for
Poetry in Translation (1981), the American-Scandinavian Foundation Award for
Poetry in Translation (1989), Fund for Poetry Awards for Contributions to
Contemporary Poetry (1989, 1991), The Finnish Government Prize for
Translation of Finnish Literature (1996), and a Gertrude Stein Award in
Innovative American Poetry 1995-1996 (1996).

Michael Cajero. It was back in grad school, at Kent State University,
thatCajero first came under the spell of the ephemeral. He had been doing
regular two-dimensional paintings, applying pigment to the flat surfaces of
cloth or paper, when he started hearing about process art and arte povera.
These two schools emphasized what Cajero calls the "physicality of
materials" and "raw forms," giving equal value to such highly prized media
as oils and marble and mass-marketed goods. Cajero started experimenting
with junk materials designed not to last--masking tape and cheap wrapping
paper and newsprint. He twisted them into sculptural forms and spattered
them with paint.

After picking up a master's in painting, sculpture and art history, Cajero
came back home to his native Tucson. Immersed once again in the folkloric
imagery of the Hispanic Southwest, he began to see that the materials of
arte povera would make a perfect marriage with the icons of Mexican folk
art. Mexican artists of necessity have long used cheap, transitory materials
for their works--bread, sugar, clay--and Cajero mimicked this practice by
using paper and tape to make Mexicanesque skeletons and dancers and
musicians. Over the years Cajero, who teaches regularly at Pima College, the
Tucson Museum of Art and the UA, has taken these folkloric figures into new
territory. In 1992, the 500th-year anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the
New World, Cajero filled an entire room in the University of Arizona Museum
of Art with giant "light altars" chronicling the disasters of the Spanish
Conquest.

Geez, I wish this were true. I mean, the part about older poets taking
risks certainly is, often moreso than younger poets. Bly of course has
never taken a risk in his life, but that's another matter. What I wish were
true is the connection between political conservativism and creative
stagnation. Lots of examples to the contrary, but  Celine will do for now.

well, a window is divided into "panes", & if a window is just
made up of a single pane you don't say it is paneless.

if a novel were composed of one gigantic paragraph the fact
would be noted in so many words (& such have probably been
written, i imagine). you could say "it's not divided into
paragraphs" as well.

there are plenty of "single paragraph" stories in the genre
known as "sudden fiction". and many prose poems have that
same construction, & are not miscalled "paragraphs".

some of us are apt to notice the resemblance between this &
the classic koan of clapping.

but (& i have to explain these to ESOL students every week) the
subject of articles in English has never been satisfactorily
explained, & is unlikely to ever be--for English is a non-linear
language.

that way lies madness...

>that way lies madness...<

or: that way madness lies (!)


living in King Lear's capital, as in, 'Hie we then to Leicester' I am
acutely aware of insanity, when I walk by the local river and ponder where
he and Cordelia and Richard the Third all lie buried I often reflect on
these issues, to no result ever. As for standing paragraphs, it depends how
much they've had to drink, I think, ouch, sorry for the rhyme, I've
definitely seen them falling over in bars at the end of the night.

that's an outstanding paragraph...

the sentence might answer this quandry.  the simple definition is that it
expresses a complete thot.  but then the sentence is divisible as well into
words, and words into letters, and letters into lines and curves and bears
oh my.

but seriously, paragraph seems to suggest a singular multiplicity; a span of
language.  the fact it can be named means it exists, at least on the level
of nomenclature, as a fixed whole.

**So then, what definitively is called a single item of text, of which there
is no more and none before?**

that depends on the larger system used to lock the text the single item is
being removed from, i.e. the alphabet is composed of letters, the sentence
is dependent on words as a subunit, a paragraph requires sentences, I should
probably be sleeping, etc...

this email is a fixed item of text as soon as I'm finished typing it.  sure
it can be altered and changed, but to do so requires that it existed in the
first place.  Das ding en Sict...

didn't flaubert dream of the perfect novel as a composition dependent
entirely on its own logic, built solely from itself with no reference to any
outside reality?

and then there's politics and context, cultural moments, and what the gravy
is made with at my work (i'm convinced they sell mushroom gravy as beef...).

Gabriel,
This looks to be, on the face of it, a very expensive and lucrative
scholarship fund for Bush administration supporters' kids and educational
facility directors, administrators, presidents, and the corporations
affiliated with them.

Interesting...  I guess that if I had just a bit more time and courage, I
would submit hundreds or thousands of serious applications on the part of
_______, or maybe from ________ here, and surely members of congress as well
as prime CEO's or execs from not-so-nice companies, or "bashers" (jerks on
stock forums like Yahoo Finance and Lycos Raging Bull, in some cases paid by
hedge funds and boiler rooms who talk trash and tell lies about stocks in
order to get naive and "newbie" investors/traders to panic and sell their
shares on otherwise temporal downtrends so that they can pick up the shares
cheaply or cover short positions with greater profits).  Anyway, give the
ORAU arm of the Homeland Security Department plenty enough applicants to
keep their screening committee busy.

Then again, though, isn't all of that money for these great monthly stipends
(none for English, Philosophy, Humanities, or Languages students) coming out
of federal tax dollars.  Hmmm.

ORAU is, apparently, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, a "consortium of 86
colleges and universities that  promotes and manages partnerships between
member universities, industry and the Department of Energy."  www.orau.org
The vast majority of the colleges are southern, presumably more
heavily-weighted with evangelicals and the right-wing's voting constituency.
http://www.orau.org/academic/members/membersalpha.htm

I suspect it wouldn't be difficult to find out who (or what department)
corresponds with dhsed.  http://www.orau.gov/dhsed/grad.htm  and
dhsed@orau.gov <mailto:dhsed@orau.gov>.

Probably wouldn't be a bad idea to query any major newspapers like the NY
Times or the Washington Post.  They may have folks interested in taking
advantage of these great opportunies or getting their kids into the program
for free educations.  Yep.
Or Poets-against-the-war, they may want to encourage members to apply.
Looks like a good opportunity to me.  Never hurts to try and try and try.
And maybe with a little bit of pressure, the Dept. of Homeland Security
could open these taxpayers' national security educational program and "free"
scholarships to students enrolled in colleges in California, which along
with most of the west looks rather under-represented:
http://www.orau.org/academic/members/members.htm.  Umm, come to think of it,
most of the Northeast colleges and their students appear to be ineligible
for these opportunities, also.  Geesh, that's almost illegal or
discriminatory, isn't it?
Yeah, the more I look into this, the more I get the impression that a lot of
folks are being left out and, frankly, I paid my taxes (didn't make enough
last year to get any tax breaks).  Is this program fair?
Ummm, damn.

The second issue of Pores (http://www.bbk.ac.uk/pores/) is simply
tremendous. Here is the Babelfish translation of Habib Tengour's
Operation Binoculars,

Ron

------------------------------------------------------


Operation binoculars=20

The shortly after September 11, I should have awaked me American. The
metamorphosis did not have anything of surprising. It arrived! In Paris.
In Copenhagen. In Ankara... Alchemy of the loan to be carried. But me?
To find me in my bed, similar with the day before, had what to worry the
neighbors. I touched myself. What arrives? What arrives to us? However,
I looked at television. Like everyone. I did not take down a settee.
Like everyone. And like everyone, I did not believe my eyes of them.
Impossible! Impossible! The film passed and passed by again. Without
stop. The advertising page jumped. Deferred series. Not question of
fiction. Documentary incredible. INOUI! It is the direct one. In my
agitated sleep, it passed to the idle. The two binoculars subsided on my
chest. I started. I relit television. That started again. By interval,
the camera angle changed. I was sounded by the catastrophe. The images
ate me the glance. Diabolic puffs raised me the heart. What arrives to
me?=20

I test difficulties of finding the formula for saying what occurs.
Analyses abound. With carries part. The words do not miss. And of the
neologisms. The newspapers provide us each day of it. The metamorphosis
developed. And me? Despite everything my efforts and a goodwill with the
top of any suspicion. But perhaps had I unconscious reserves to
cooperate. That requires a thorough examination.=20

The third day, I p=E9t=E9 leads. Name of God! My cranium bursts. Inside, =
it
is a pulp. It is necessary that that ceases! Move yourself! I =
trifouill=E9
the meter with a nail-clippers. Clac! Roasted the cathode ray tube. I
rub the hands. I did not metamorphose myself but I acquired
mischievousness. It is perhaps frustration not to be American like
everyone. That taps me. The pile of newspapers to the dustbin. I would
never have time to read... What a relief!=20
I became insane. To bind.=20
As this character of Gogol which loses its nose while crossing the
street. Fortunately, I had a strong cold. A respite...=20
- Now that the tele one is ruined, you are satisfied! me engueule it.
With what that does advance you? If you are not rotten to even make the
share of the things!... I warn you: you repair it or you buy another of
them! And fissa!=20
...=20
The lexicon is treacherous... One can say what one wants. But when you
do not awake like everyone, there is what to be alarmed. It is much more
serious. The neighbor of stage does not say any more hello. They all are
there in front of, to await the elevator; and you, you take the
backstairs. What changed? How to know? You broke the tele one... There
is average, the radio functions. The emissions are more intelligent. The
voice does not puff out the brain like the image.=20
I calm myself. I do not include/understand what is told. It is not with
me that one speaks. Return to me the words of a reader: "It is your
language. But you do not write the language of yours. In addition, you
live outside! How thus think you of contributing to an unspecified
national avant-garde?" A little brutal, hypocritical reader ...=20
"the avant-garde, told me If Nacer, these were six gray sheep that one
renewed with each crossing of the Maurice line. Bigeard had discovered
the trick. During the operation binoculars, it sent shepherds as a scout
systematically.   "... I often thought of this thin herd. No monument
celebrates their sacrifice with the fatherland. Very early, this
anecdote sowed suspicion in my spirit.=20
However, I made the barricades!=20
It is Stratis the sailor who saved me drowning. It trailed me with a bar
of the Bastille. To speak, one is better. The salted almonds untie the
language. Of goal in white: "Then? Does the policy, that really interest
you?... The praxis? Of course! But this deserted policy public places.
The ra=EF makes fury. Drop all that. You are conspicuous. And a man of =
the
past! You, you do not require that clogged companions attach you to a
mast to listen to the song of the sirens...=20
By bits. Glanant per Ci. Jumping by there. Advancing straight. Turning
over me. Forking. Fragmentation of the thought. That turns in round.=20
"This sudden passion is equivocal", said Kateb. With Malek, we looked it
with recognition. Something in the intonation. We were alone to seize
the nuance. That put balsam in the heart to us. But here is an
inaccessible event. I did not find words to transmit it. Not facts. In
oneself, without interest. But magic of the situation. Kateb, if
worthy...=20
_ this order me ravit. Thank you, unknown friends, to have made me sign.
Thank you in you, Pierre, to have communicated my address... It said in
the mouth of the wolf . Eh, well? Where is the need? It is always a
question of form.=20
S=E9nac, cut out holes in its books to him. "With time, the world, one
carries it inside oneself. One has very few words to make fly." I
represent our discussion. Because the body was not there any more. The
revolution abhorred its stripped plaster boards of management. Which
fault made voiceless our following days?=20
I learned how to work. With me to conceal. The poet must be erased.=20
Not to choke the poem.=20
What arrives? One spends time to see it. More one supplement to realize
some. Baghdad was shaven. Grenade fell. And Jerusalem  ? The dates run
up against the wickets. Rotted pot of the memory... Since the beginning,
the Arabs remember a radiant future hopelessly. To two range of arc.
This great nation resulting from the son of the maidservant is made type
on the fingers. And that lasts. Is this genetic? How all that programmed
is? Too much, it too is!=20
The friends die in a number. Also those die which I do not know. To
funerals, the faithful ones follow the procession in cash. Far from the
world. Progressively, their number is reduced. They train a small
family. With the variation, the corner of the street. One serves a tea
or a coffee with the choice to them. They take some dates. There is
always to tell the same stories thousand times told.=20
...=20
"the time of the Arabs..." sighed Emile.=20

By Chris Gaither, Globe Staff, 4/24/2003

SAN FRANCISCO - The San Francisco Chronicle fired
Henry Norr, one of its technology reporters, one
month after suspending him for taking a day off
from work to protest the war in Iraq.

Norr, 57, was one of about 1,400 protesters
arrested here on March 20, the day after American
bombs began falling on Baghdad. The four-year
veteran of the Chronicle spent the day in jail,
along with his wife and 25-year-old daughter.
Each was charged with being a pedestrian in the
road, for blocking traffic.

Though the paper dismissed Norr for improperly
claiming sick leave that day, his situation also
illustrates the difficulty in balancing
journalists' desire to express their political
views and news organizations' desire to appear
objective to their audiences.

Aly Colon, an ethics professor with the Poynter
Institute, a journalism school in St. Petersburg,
Fla., said he found it ''ironic'' that
newspapers, often watchdogs for the right to free
speech, sometimes act against employees for
expressing their views outside of work. He
questioned whether terminating Norr was the best
solution, but said the Chronicle must protect its
credibility.

''When individuals stand for something that
causes people to question whether they can be
fair in what they do, something has to be done to
address that,'' Colon said.

Norr said he never hid his arrest from his
bosses. He said he sent e-mail to his editors,
late on the eve of the protests, telling them of
his intention to be arrested. He also asked for a
month's leave earlier in March to devote all his
time to protesting - a request that he said went
unanswered.

Yet when he filled out his timecard on March 21,
he marked the missed time as a sick day. He said
he regrets having done that, rather than putting
in for a vacation day. But he said he never hid
his reasons for missing work, and that his
manager signed the card the following Monday, two
days before his suspension.

''If they had a column on the timecard for `jail
day,' I would have put that,'' he said in an
interview yesterday.

The Chronicle pulled Norr's next column, about
technology that prevents unwanted e-mail, before
publication, then suspended him on March 26. The
paper fired him this week.

Representatives of the Chronicle, owned by Hearst
Corp., declined to comment, saying they do not
discuss personnel issues.

In a termination letter sent to Norr late Monday,
Chronicle editor Phil Bronstein cited the
''falsification'' of Norr's timecard and ''an
improper claim for paid sick leave'' as
sufficient grounds for dismissal. ''Your personal
political activities are no excuse to permit a
false claim,'' Bronstein wrote.

But he suggested that Norr's political activities
played a role in the decision to fire him. While
on unpaid leave, Norr was arrested and hit with
wooden pellets fired by police in other protests
around the Bay Area, actions that Bronstein
called ''persistent violations'' of the
newspaper's ethics policies.

''Even if you had not claimed a paid workday, we
would not permit you to return to work in the
Chronicle newsroom,'' Bronstein wrote. ''To do so
would irreparably compromise our journalistic
standards and the expectations we have for
everyone in the newsroom.''

Norr, however, said his protests violated none of
the Chronicle's ethics policies at the time.
Since his suspension, the newspaper has amended
its policies to explicitly prohibit antiwar
protests by its staff members.

The local newspaper union, the Northern
California Media Workers Guild, has filed
grievances against the newspaper for the
suspension, the termination, and the changes to
the Chronicle's ethics policy.

Norr is due in court today. He has not yet
entered a plea. The charge against his daughter
has been dismissed; his wife is awaiting a court
appearance.

Anyone familiar with Robert Bly's life, poetry, theories, and political
activities over the past forty years, I suggest would find your contention
that he "has never taken a risk in his life" to be an arrogant, ignorant
remark.

As for the connection between political conservatism and creative
stagnation, it was more inspired than factual, more about connecting the way
one writes to one's awareness of how the world interconnects. I would choose
Wallace Stevens, to refute myself. I hope some scholars here will be moved
take up the question as to how one's politics effects, or doesn't effect,
the range of one's poetry.

The Collar
         -- by George Herbert

I the advice struck and cried, no more.
                 I abroad.
         What? Sigh and pin of I never?
My lines and lives are free; freely as road!
       release as large wind therefore like the shop.
       Is it that I must always be in the clothes?
        Don't I have harvest, but a thorn?
         Let not restore my blood and
which I lost with the cordial fruit.
                 Reliably there was wine
before my sighs dried it: it was there from the corn
         before my tears drowned it.
Is the year lost only at me?
         Don't I have departments to crown?
No flowers, no merry country? all blew?
         Did everything waste?
     Not also my heart: but there are fruit
                 and branches to be handed around.
      The whole age sighs and winds accumulate
         again on double delights: leave the cold conflict
             from what is not adapted.
         The rope of the sand places a cage on it,
which the small thoughts made and made at the good cable of thee,

Doesn't this piece of ersatz babelfish poetry perfectly exemplify the
quotation above that was cited in the same email? I'm getting mixed messages

In the Gudding-Herbert-Babelfish tradition - and the elimination of bleacher
sanctimony -  I have translated my original message into French and back
into English. My own basketball game - I am told - has not gotten any
better! Here goes:


Give to Shaq a human cut. In last week it is had a death in the family and
has or is about to become a father, passes it simultaneously must accept all
this flack mytho-poetic! Shaq is a whale, Garnett a bird - one to take
completely different to obtain with the basket. I prefer birds (grimace of
tho G is in addition to setting.) I never saw the play of Rasheed Wallace de
Portland against Garnett - but of both, the scales of wing of the incredibly
beautiful slappings of each product. Did no matter who see a contest the
other in the sky? Ground without myth - go, Warriors Oakland - the next year
- if not the next one or the next one or!).

I guess that means we disagree. And I imagine that everyone who disagrees
with you is arrogant and ignorant.

For the record, for the most part I stopped following Bly's career after he
started banging on drums.

Bly found a manner very young and rode it to death. The risks I referred to
are aesthetic risks, and they have been scant.

Mark, you might find it interesting to check out Bly's poems
in the old Hall/Pack anthology with those done later, especially
after he got interested (and got a lot of us interested) in poets
such as Machado, Neruda, and others writing in Spanish.

Thanks, Hal. I'll amend: Bly found a manner a long time ago.

I've always found him superficial, and his poetry, post-Machado, Neruda,
etc., usually decorative at best.

But sometimes not.  I think it was in 1969 that I heard him read at Barnard
College a poem that was then one of his signature pieces--I can't remember
what it was called, and I don't have time to try to dig it out of my
disorganized library. The protagonist, explicitly meant to be himself,
discovers, while walking along the beach after the Santa Barbara oil spill,
a dying sea lion. Every day for a week he goes back to check on its agony.
On the seventh day he finds it dead and the sky of the poem opens into a
Wordsworthian moment.  It wasn't hard to agree with the sentiments, but it
seemed a bit strange to be told by the poet what a nice, sensitive guy he
is when he should clearly either have called the SPCA or put the animal out
of its misery himself.  Of course it would have been a shorter poem.

So there was the morality pretended to and the morality rendered dishonest
by a cloud of narcissism.

I don't, and didn't, trust the poems.

I've used up my message quota for the day--any potshots will have to remain
unanswered.

the same articles "a" & "the" are used to mark two unrelated
distinctions of definite/indefinite, & first mention/already
mentioned, as well as special uses which indicate typical, &
the title of something. (this is off the top of my head, &
probably not exhaustive). only a familiarity with the vast
amount of common contexts can teach which article to use on
which occasion, as there is no set of hard-&-fast rules in
English (unlike most every other language in this situation).
newcomers usually hit upon a set of conventions that can
be used to translate what their own language does into
something that is at least recognizable as English. but
people who have been fluent in English as a second language
even for ten years, still make this kind of mistake occasionally.

Sorry Mark. Bly's an old friend, and my reaction to your put-down was from
the gut. Probably no one has introduced so many poets from around the world
to US readers as he's been doing since his The Fifties journal. I also find
his latest book, as I read deeper into it, quite astounding for their energy
and erudition. The work does resound with  poems he's been writing for many
decades; however, I suggest they've reached a maturity here, which I find
exciting.

>

That was a stage. Silly, maybe. He has always felt that poets have a social
responsibility, and the men's groups were a way to promote poetry in a more
intimate format than giving readings. They were a way of integrating poetry
into the psychic life of non-poets. Drumming it in, so to speak.

The problem with finding "a manner" when young and sticking with it is an
important issue. While many painters, for example, have distinct "periods"
they go through as they develop, most poets don't. I don't know why. Perhaps
we can discuss this?

Best,

  WOMAN ON WOMAN
May 1 - May 24, 2003
Opening reception: Thursday, May 1st, 2003 6-8 pm

Curated by Claire Jervert

Delia Brown / Kathleen Gilje / Julie Heffernan / Sissel Kardel /
Alexis Karl / Joan Semmel / Su-en Wong / Lisa Yuskavage

White Box is pleased to present Woman On Woman, a group exhibition of
work that looks at the surprisingly under-explored territory of
contemporary women painters who are creating images of the nude female
body, both their own and others. While the work of female photographers
who are working along similar lines has recently been extensively
examined, this will be the first survey of the remarkable range of work
being created by women who's subject is women.

Lisa Yuskavage is represented by a groundbreaking work from the early
'90s, one of her earliest oils depicting the female body. Delia Brown's
paintings of wealthy young women sensuously enjoying themselves include
representations of herself. An ethereal delicacy infuses Sissel Kardel's
fairytale-like renderings of women in nature.  Utilizing an old master
technique, Julie Heffernan employs her self-image, placing it in
allegorical settings that elude explication.  Alexis Karl paints nude
portraits of close friends juxtaposed against monochrome backgrounds
often holding objects that carry particular symbolic meanings.  Su-en
Wong's self-representations reveal the contradictions and tensions
inherent in her life as a young artist in the US and her Asian cultural
heritage.  Old master paintings are re-imagined from a contemporary
perspective in the work of Kathleen Gilje, who here removes the
elaborate, restrictive period clothing to reveal both the flesh beneath
and the inherent psychological complexity of the sitter. Finally, Joan
Semmel is represented by some of her pioneering work from the 1970's,
images of her body painted from her own point of view as she gazes down
upon it, work that looks astonishingly contemporary and fresh.

A panel discussion will take place Wednesday, May 7th, at 7:30.
Panelists include Grady T. Turner, Joan Semmel, Sissel Kardel, and Su-en
Wong. Woman On Woman will be the subject of a White Box catalogue with
essays by Grady T. Turner, Ana Finel Honigman and Manon Slome.

Viewing hours: Tuesday-Saturday 11am - 6pm.

Slought Foundation, in conjunction with Chain Arts, is pleased to
announce the premier of "SEVEN VEILS (Poetry in Moving Media)," a
multimedia dance-theater piece based on an adaptation of "Salome" by
Thalia Field (Point and Line, New Directions 2000). Innovative choral
music composed by Philadelphia-based Alexander DeVaron provides a
complex and often humorous sonic atmosphere for Jamie Jewett's quirky
amalgam of release, butoh and contemporary indonesian dance styles.

life through art and theory. "Dimensional Text" is an event series
collaboration between Chain Arts and Slought Foundation. The dimensional

Biographies:

Thalia Field's collection, POINT AND LINE, was published in 2000 by New
Directions. Her second book, INCARNATE: STORY MATERIAL is forthcoming
with New Directions in 2004 and a multimedia novel, ULULU (SHRAPNEL
SCENES), with film stills by Bill Morrison, is forthcoming from Coffee
House Press in 2005. Thalia's performance writing and essays have been
published in Theater magazine and she was a Senior Editor for several
years at Conjunctions where she guest-edited an issue (#28) devoted to
experimental music-theater. Thalia has taught at Bard College, Naropa
University and currently teaches in Brown's Creative Writing program. In
1998 she co-founded the Summer Writing and Performance Project at
Perseverance Theater in Juneau, AK.

Jamie Jewett holds a BA in Movement and Buddhist Studies from Naropa
University and an MFA in Dance and Technology from the Ohio State
University. His dance background includes intensive study of Butoh, and
he has performed at the Joyce Theatre as a company member of Popo and
The Go Go Boys, as well as works by Bebe Miller, David Rousseve and
others. A certified teacher of the Shambhala Dharma Arts, Jewett's work
is deeply influenced by Eastern philosophy of composition. In 2000,
Jewett was awarded a grant from USINDO (the US Indonesian Foundation) to
apprentice with Suprapto Suryodarmo, a contemporary Indonesian Master of
dance, ritual performance and installation art. Through this
relationship, Jewett has taught and performed at a variety of festivals
in Java, Bali, New York and Boulder. Jewett's intermedia dance,
"Snowblind", was commissioned by University of Michigan's IMMEDIA
festival in 2002 and his dance-film, "Auslander", was selected as part
of Lincoln Center's Danc!
 e on Camera festival and the Wexner Center's Ohio Film and Video
Festival.

Alexander deVaron holds degrees from Connecticut Wesleyan University and
Indiana University, where his teachers included Alvin Lucier, Richard
Winslow, Eugene Brien, and David Dzubay. His works have been performed
In Canada, Europe and throughout the United States. He is the 2003
winner of the Network For New Music Poetry Project competition, and his
music has been featured by such ensembles as the Tufts New Music
Ensemble, the Seattle New Music Ensemble and the New England
Conservatory Cammerata. Over the last twenty years, Mr. deVaron has
combined his study of music with the study of Buddhism and meditation.
Over the course of these years, he has worked closely with the composer
Peter Lieberson to explore the meeting place of these two traditions.
Currently he is pursuing a doctoral degree at Temple University, where
he studies with Maurice Wright and Richard Brodhead.

That was the text written during Afghanistan. What is different from
watching what can be watched of the war are questions, those questions
that are asked of the foreigner from the warring nation, framed in the
form of the search for a statement, as though there exist words that
might be stated capable of containing (in translation) "the wound in
the world" spoken in Chita in an English where the first syllable in
'topic' is pronounced with much the same sound as the word for 'earth'
in Chinese. Each room is different, and the question the same, about
the war, what about the war, the war my nation is making, when to say
that it is not my nation would fail to refer. How can you not be where
you come from? Here, in the space of this question, first Afghanistan,
and now Iraq, India and Pakistan, Palestine, mapped, in the name, by
the question that states the name, Iraq? Iran? Turkey?  Kurdistan?
English is the target language. That was the question in Yurga, not
the private question, when one of the English teachers asked that
question always asked, What do you think of the war? In the formal
space, the question substituting for the question about the war is the
question of language, the English language, the German language, the
Japanese language. These are the languages where technical knowledges
are stored. As these were the nations that were once at war. Futile to
answer that one is against the war, as impossible as to say any longer
'futile' as though it were only the word 'few' with 'tl' at the
end. Whether or not the loss of inflectional endings in English can be
attributed to the Scandinavian settlements in the north and the
corruptions that enter in second-language learning or the accent on
the root-morpheme inherited from the earlier Germanic forms. Both
would appear to have next to nothing to do with contemporary history,
'the history of our military and literary triumphs' (Victor Fournel,
1858 [A7a3]). No war was ever prevented by the protests of its
artists. The century of the wars, this century, and it is this that
can never be said to the question about the war, an accelerating
process the preparation for which has been said to have been the
occupation of Panama, that it is only the beginning of a much greater
cycle or process or period of time. Someone wrote in an article for
'The Commoner' about Kronstadt. Someone must still be made to take
responsibility for Kronstadt. Immanuel Wallerstein writes of a
Chinese-Japanese alliance. The paragraph about the imperial armies in
Empire failed to foresee the character of the present war, relying on
the appearance of agreements among nations, which are always
appeasement. Such sentences as these seem to slide away from their
language, their discourse, in the attempt to formulate a statement
when there is no statement that can be trusted by the poetic?

Two statements were written during Afghanistan, one for an essay
published in a small 'conference' magazine in Russia and translated
into Russian (it appeared also on the generation_online discussion
list, the url for which can be found at the Multitudes site), and the
other statement took shelter in a poem, or should it be said that the
statement only belongs to the poem, and one which passed by the eyes
of editors (BeeHive). The first statement is part of a thesis reading
Swift-as-Zizek:

"As William Langland, in his long poem called Piers Plowman, written
at the other end of the historical process where an agrarian economy
and society was transformed into the industrial and modern nation of
England, Swift is also asking, How can I see my time? The imaginary
figures in the work of giant and doll, professors in the clouds of
unknowing, and horses debating the extermination of Yahoos obscure
without obliterating the line of descent for this book from the
tradtion of the political tract as practiced by Milton in his essay,
On the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates. Swift's satire anticipates the
intellectual climate informing the emancipatory events in America and
France at the end of the eighteenth century and offers us a conceptual
optic for understanding why Zizek's reading of Kant, Hegel, Heidegger
and Lacan against the backdrop of popular culture in the West begins
with the refusal of the Cartesian 'cogito' to remain buried despite
the efforts of contemporary theoretical discourses in Europe and
America to declare the collapse of the Enlightenment horizon and the
transformation of subjectivity without any corresponding
transformation of the social and property relations theorized by
historical materialism. The task of recognizing the limits to
understanding from within the labor of contributing to changing the
world we live in is one of the social responsibilities documentary,
theoretical and imaginative writings share. Whether undertaken
collectively or individually, it should not be a labor of Sisyphus."
(Pacifist, p. 99).

From "Haystack/Tekct," Pacifist, p. 117: "Propositions are either
proven or unproven. Disproved. Disapproved. This is what a book is
isn't it, don't books codify perception, and the authority of them,
or, their authority, what is that authority, when laws that operate in
the language should also be said to operate on the language. The logic
in history does not appear in the appearance of the event, even if the
event cannot be known other than by its appearances. From its
appearance, why are there so many ways to say the same thing? The many
ways there are to make the event appear to correspond to the
operations of logic. Variability as condition, the experience of
reference as variable articulation, and the event, the military event,
the existence in history of the idea that war accelerates history by
intensifying contradictions and creating the conditions where the
question of state power will be posed according to the necessity of
imposing absolute powers, so that the decision by the state to use war
to resolve contradictions in the operation of the social and economic
order which the state is intended to sustain, and when it does not,
when it declares by its military policies that the only resolution to
internal and external conflicts are wars of aggression, then the
proposition that the state which uses war to invade and occupy weaker
countries declares to the civil society that it is no longer capable
of governing, and such a state must be opposed for the purpose of the
overturning of the powers which constitute that government."

These statements are entered into the historical record represented by
this archive to pressure the problem of whether what can be said in a
theoretical essay or a book of poems can also be stated in the
volatile, material-immaterial space of the electronic communication,
as well as to pressure the statement-bearing capacity of poetic itself.

"His book will have to renounce any ambition to political impact, as
this is understood today; in other words, it will have to give up all
hope of demagogic effect." (Walter Benjamin)

Orbital Crossed-circuitry


Cordelia: Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
            As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
            Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
            With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
            Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
            In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
            Search every acre in the high-grown field,
            And bring him to our eye.  What can man's wisdom
            In the restoring his bereaved sense?
            He that helps him take all my outward worth.

Doctor:   There is means, madam:
            Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
            The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
            Are many simples operative, whose power
            Will close the eye of anguish.

Cordelia: All blest secrets,
            All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
            Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
            In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
            Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
            That wants the means to lead it.

  -- King Lear, Act IV, scene IV



Rings around the world
become ringing in your ears.
One look in the mirror shows you
the rings circling your eyes.
Bulls lock horns in your a-
posteriori assumptions recursively sneering
stumped cauterized frustrations,
sublimations, nation-states coursing
through your seething blue-sparked madness
circumscribed by opposable grasp
of what is really nothing.  Sharp
sting of the alkaline burr.  That
taste.  It is nothing.  All thumbs you
grasp the phone, grab those horns,
steering, gravitating with finite state
machinations down the halls
of circuits leering. But you don't
do it discreetly.  We cheer
you on.  Thumbs up. Calling for help.

This is not the sound of a phone ringing.

Fight fight fight, keep on keeping on.
You be one with you, let you be you,
time now for your studio audience,
their backs form your stage, your
vessel of rage.  You is jackboot and you
is simply not.  You is me, I'll be your mirror,
the construction of hatred in stark light,
of anger in sunshine charades.  Hand puppets
leave their permanent marks abstractly,
hands down a fourth grader's pants.
We call this branding.  We are we,
yes, patently trivial, solid, liquid,
and gaseous.  Which one?  Such a concept requires
loving a body, such a fastening needs
a hammer for hanging, walls for spackling,
and nails for smashing.  We have pillows,
fascinating conversation, pills,
and involuntary shelter safe from moonlight.
Feel free to stay here while you recover.

This is not the sound of the heavens singing.

Yes it is an abstraction clutching your throat.
But it is about you at least.  Shaking free makes it
tighter, you see the purple of fading stars
suffocating neurons and they're exploding and that
ringing.  This is not sense, none of it.
Sense is not generative, that is to say,
it does not make itself, sense does not make
sense.  You will have to see it to,
ah, forget it. Sense has no reason.  It's the only way
to go.  You just have to.  Go.  Your goodness
and your generosity is the coin flip
of calamity.  So tell everyone you are happy.
You've played the shaved poodle before.

This is not the sound of a phone ringing.

Don't ask a poet who you are. The more evasive
the answer the more pervasive the blather.
Don't ask a poem what it is, your evaluation
is a reflection of what you are, or rather,
you will only see the rearrangement of all the versions
you have forged on the subject of who you want to be.

This is not the sound of the heavens singing.
This is not the sound of a phone ringing.

So tell me you love me.  I love you.  Hi there!
Projective voice like a hand on your thigh, or
is it like a fist wearing rings cast up your anus?
Now that we've established such an intimate connection,
please tell me, won't you dear, oh iron in fire,
why is love so like nature, such an obscenity,
such ephemeral cruelty, crossed circuitry
of freedom and captivity?  Brutality is hatred and love
circled by oscillations of attention.  Attenuated muck.
Hit me when you fuck me.  Love me and tell me
I'm dirt.  Strike me down and lift me up.  Punch me.
Break off my rib.  Dinner and a movie. Thanks God
for the lovely date, this dumpster and a snuff flick.

This is not the sound of the heavens singing.

The struggle for living, the endless orbit
with a finite distance, is an affront to itself,
like any orifice.  Orbicularis, temporalis,
I see you is ICU, iris, pupil, and canthus,
There's very little this eye likes to miss.

This is not the sound of a phone ringing.

Horrendous guilt.  Make the sign of the cross,
the mark of permanent exclusion
merely rotated and bloodied.
The battle zone landscape of your
spontaneity.  When face-down
in the mud we tend to lack
alacrity.

This is not the sound of the heavens singing.
This is not the sound of a phone ringing.

Burial mound and stinging salt in my eye
as ungoverned madness of a vexed swirling sea, as
the minutest annoyance like the bite of a flea,
as whole kingdoms collapsed in the gaze of a fly.

This is not the sound of a phone ringing.
This is not the sound of the heavens singing.

Telephone ringing, the party's over,
last line digested in flatulent sleeping,
water pipe leaking, scratchy song rehashed:

    ashes to ashes, fun to deadly,
    we know you're singing one fucked-up medley

I have to say goodbye now, I'm heeding the calling,
the message on your machine, red light flashing,
the one you might not hear but is always waiting.

You know the one.  It's the only

you have been disconnected

a little digi/tea--green jasmine?--since i had to miss hearing 60 at MIT:

from Betsugen Enshi (1294-1364 AD)**:

Brewing Tea

On clouds of jade green, drawn out on the breeze,
Stretch white blossoms over the bowl's surface, cooling to the touch;
As the mountain moon stirs plum-blossom shadows on the window,
I fill the rough bowl again, sip the lingering fragrance.



from Kokan Shiren (1278-1345 AD)**:

Impromptu Poem

The sky over the bay ahead a mass of cloud,
Now dark, now light, reflecting the setting sun's rays,
Back feathers light black, belly feathers white--
I watch the flock of sea birds turn and wheel in flight.

Is there a theme for the next issue?  As I will be teaching at St. Mary's in
Spring 2004, I'd like to contribute.

To me this just the cognitive version of ethnomethodology (i.e.
empirical responsibility -- no categories/assumptions) which pre-dates
any organized cognitive science.

For instance, unlike symbolic interactionists, ethnomethodologists do
not assume (a priori) that people actually share common symbolic
meanings.

Data, not theory -- right?

So I guess we can all become buddhists

you can examine different videos under the influence of the algorithms. She also writes
intelligently and engagingly about digital video in pieces such as "We are all projectionists".

A modest dig:

This was an interesting project while it remained in its virtual state. But
now that it is being printed up, do you have any concerns about the negative
ecological impact this will have on the world? The number of trees
sacrificed, etc. I mean, we are presumably looking at the publication of
100,000 volumes (several million pages) and more to come. Your indefatigable
enthusiasm and unquenchable obsession are truly admirable traits, but I get
the uneasy sense that you are a bit like an elephant (or rather perhaps a
herd of virtual elephants) on stampede, taking little note of what you are
trampling.

Should a writer care about such matters? A discussion of this would be nice.

Gloria:

Unfortunately, we don't publish our own poetic work or the poetry of
faculty and staff at Saint Mary's college (we mentioned this in the
editorial of our first edition).

Copies are available at St. Mary's and through Small Press
Distribution:  spdbook.org.   We also have a website: 26magazine.com.
EVERYONE should buy the new edition, which looks great and is full of
great work!

Best,

This is an interesting issue.  I'm torn, on one hand, admiring
Highland's energy and innovative ideas (the muse-apprentice guild
concept), and on the other being put off by the manic-depressive, manic
phase energy-sheen on it all.  To get form letters asking for work with
my name plugged into the "appropriate" places, is also a bit unsettling
for me. (I think of poetry as most intimate corespondence/address.) But
I don't see how she can do her project otherwise.  My general tendency
is to watch.  She is _damned interesting,_ and that beats the hell out
of most of the poetry culture I see. (I'm not including the type of
activity usually referenced on this list.)

To answer some questions from recent threads on cognitive and
neuro- poetics:

I've been teaching a seminar in cognitive poetics this semester; the
syllabus can be found at:
http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/%7Ecxr1086/courses/eng553.html
The syllabus offers only names and titles, but you can cross ref them to
an extended and updated annotated bibliography at the Literature,
Cognition and the Brain site:
http://www2.bc.edu/~richarad/lcb/home.html
Or bc me and I'll get you more details.

There is also a recent book called "Cognitive Poetics" by Peter Stockwell,
out from Routledge last year.  His book falls into a more accepting
European tradition of applying linguistic methodologies to literature,
still occasionally under the rubric of stylistics.

A very useful resource is Norman Holland's seminar "The Brain and the
Book." This does not focus on poetry, but provides an excellent overview
of what has been accomplished so far, especially connecting neuroscience
to literary studies.  The outline is at:
http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/nnh/seminar/memo-s02.htm

To answer Maria Damon's question:
> Any insights from Ray Gibbs, my old high school buddy, who wrote The
Poetics of Mind?  it's about metaphor and cognitive psych.

Yes and no--he provides lots of empirical support for Lakoff and Johnson's
theory of cognitive metaphor, which I think assists anyone who wants to
apply the theory of cognitive metaphor to particular poems.  But when he
works with literature, he is very literal-minded, so his work with poetry
is quite hopeless.  He did marginally better with a general question of
literary studies, that of the existence of the author, in his recent book
on Intention, but again I think you will find his literary arguments
lacking.  He opens up some possibilities but the real work needs to be
done.

Camille's reading selections are excellent; they seem to focus on
consciousness studies rather than work in linguistics or
psycholinguistics.  The strength of this focus is that one goal of
consciousness studies is to account for the apparent unity we find in
conscious experience, which applies well to the study of poetry in which
we seem always to circle back to questions of unity, integration, harmony,
etc.  Even if the solutions are that unities of consciousness and poetry
alike are only apparent, more socially constructed than not, there is
still a strong sense that the right questions are being asked.  Most
psycholinguistics focuses on breaking things down into parts, a
traditional approach to poetry but one that does not get at the questions
that a poetics needs finally to address.

A recent special issue of _Poetics Today_ 23:1 (2002) includes several
interesting articles applying evolutionary psychology to literary studies,
with a skeptical response by Tony Jackson.  The next issue I believe also
includes a skeptical response of some length, by Adler and Gross.

As to Tom Bell's request for "something that shows how different areas of
the brain are lit up by oral versus written poetry?" -- not yet, though we
are getting there.  There is some recent work, for example, with PET
imaging on hearing versus sign-language perception and production (Nature
397, 116 (1999) Sign language 'heard' in the auditory cortex, HIROSHI
NISHIMURA, KAZUO HASHIKAWA, et al.; Nature Neuroscience January 2002
Volume 5 Number 1 pp 76 - 80, A critical period for right hemisphere
recruitment in American Sign Language processing Aaron J. Newman, Daphne
Bavelier, et al) that shows how the brain uses the auditory cortex to
analyze speech signs even in congenitally deaf persons.  Just a start.

Thanks for the info, Clai.  I do think Camille's thesis worth reading as
well, as she deals with the poem as experiment and as process.

Skip, we're right on the same page regarding Mr/Mrs Highland. The
sheer effort he (I'd guess August is male) puts into his projects has to
count for something. The artistic veil never drops, not for a second. I'm
not sure about this, but I think he even interviews himself and writes his
own blurbs.

Still, I have a nagging feeling that I'm being duped every time I think
about August Highland, which is usually twice a day when I read his
regular contributions to this list. He seems like the type of person who
might enjoy creating a huge ball of textual garbage just to see who
would get suckered into calling it literature. August calls himself the
"enfant terrible of the literary establishment," suggesting that he's
intentionally pointing the sharpened stick of avant-garde tomfoolery
into our ribs. But I'm not sure. Maybe there is no wink and it's all
serious, in which case I'm really confounded.

If we accept August's texts as authentic art objects, are they original?
After all, mucking with textual conventions like syntax and punctuation
is pretty much old hat in the "postmodern" tradition. And I don't think
August invented the process of altering text with computer programs,
although he seems to be quite proficient at the enterprise.

I have to be honest: I generally don't enjoy the texts. I try to read them
and I fail. After a while I get bored or irritated and I have to move on.
The textual twistings are interesting, but they don't resonate with me;
It's almost as if they lack a human touch.

Then again, the concept of a Muse Apprentice Guild is stunningly
original. I love the idea of taking the author's singular identity out of the
equation, so that one person can create the works of multitudes.

Imagine if August Highland contained multiple geniuses, all with
separate creative voices. Imagine if, instead of ersatz avalanches, each
member of August's guild created a unique poetic output, completely
unlike the others. Imagine a one-man literary giant instead of a
simulated one-man literary giant . . .

Or is the simulation achievement enough?

Yes, I'd spent all this time assuming Augie is XY. AH as XX would cause me
to rethink absolutely -everything-.

i think Brennen raises a critical issue with these comments on august
highland's work.  after reading a few of the personalities' creations i
quit.  it is too much of the exact same thing.  i could attribute a
personality to each of these sentences but if the tone and voice/style are
consistent, as program generated texts tend to be, then what is achieved?
now, if each personality happened to create different texts...  imagine if
every fourth person on this list was a character created by one person.  if
the site was full of different texts then it would be much more resonant,
but the extremely high quantity of output winds up being a whole bunch of
work for very little wage.  and this fact isn't interesting enough to carry
the weight of all of the texts generated by highland.  kenny goldsmith has
done some remarkable work with 'nutritionless texts' and extending/exposing
the edges of boredom and our need for constant stimulation, but highland's
work falls flat on these levels because it is the exact same thing over and
over again purported to be by a multiplicity of writers.  the event is
interesting but that quickly fades and falls past the horizon.

hi kevin,

i was wondering if you would elaborate on why the gender of august highland
would cause you to rethink the oeuvre...

In celebration of A Tall, Serious Girl, Selected Poems: 1957 - 2000, Edited
by Kevin Davies and Larry Fagin, published by Qua Books -  as they/we used
to say, "What can I say" to honor something greater than what can be
immediately articulated in praise - if not just sheer awe - George gave a
great reading and a real voyage through a career marked by works awesome for
their breathtaking honesty, argument, investigation (personal,familial,
social, political), self-effacement and, ultimately, a forgiving tenderness
(with himself as well as us!). Perhaps similar in conviction to the best of
the Jesuit priests and teachers of his San Francisco childhood - his once
now forsaken City of God - George, as a poet, has never flinched from
responsibly serving up poems - no matter how devil-mined - that work to
articulate and contain the secular breadth and magnitude of the work's
personal and communal calling. The education, questions, the portrayal of
evidence (zoom in clarity and questioning of images), humor, beauties and
mysteries are hard won here and, indeed, as poems reward doubly.

The book itself is well edited, designed and produced, with good cover art
by Fran Herndon (1,000 copies, cloth only, 222 pages, $25).  No matter the
price of entry, I suggest pick it up in a minute before it be all gone. I
(as so many others last night) did!

The reading was sponsored by The Poetry Center and held in Oakland at the
Diesel Bookstore. It will be nice if the University of San Francisco
(George's alma mater) can soon invite him back and do a large public reading
in the City.

Pierre Joris & Nicole Peyrafitte
in
SUMERICABACHBONEs

Tuesday, April 29
7 p.m.

Gowan Room in Wilson Commons
on the U of R Campus

   Free and open to the public

Sumericabachbones features poet/scholar/translator Pierre Joris and
performance artist Nicole Peyrafitte in the most timely, provocative
and exhilarating cultural event currently touring the states.  U of R
organizing co-sponsor Dimitri Anastasopoulos describes the event as
follows:

Sumericabachbones is a nomadic performance that roams across a range
of media, metamorphosing from a poetry reading into a spectacle of
sound and scene as Nicole Peyrafitte and Pierre Joris present the
work of Iraqi dissident poets, Joris' poems which have been
influenced by Bedouin culture, and Peyrafitte's often eerie
incantations and startling digital images. Amidst a controversial
political backdrop, Joris and Peyrafitte present poetry across a
global landscape: poems that question not just cultural misreadings,
but the act of reading itself - of how language can be used to
highlight as well as undermine boundaries between peoples and genres
in the act of making meaning.

ABOUT THE PERFORMERS:

Pierre Joris left Luxembourg at eighteen & has since lived in the US,
Great Britain, North Africa & France. He has published over 20 books
& chapbooks of poetry, among them, WINNETOU OLD (Meow Press, Buffalo,
NY), TURBULENCE (St. Lazaire Press, Rhinebeck), and BRECCIA, SELECTED
POEMS 1974-1986 (Editions Phi / Station Hill), as well as several
anthologies and many volumes of translations, both into English &
into French, the most recent being Paul Celan's Breathturn, Maurice
Blanchot's The Unavowable Community & Edmond Jab=E8s's =46rom the
Desert to the Book (both from Station Hill Press). In 1992 he
returned to the Mid-Hudson valley & teaches in the Department of
English at SUNY-Albany. With Jerome Rothenberg he has published a two
volume anthology of 20th Century Avant-Garde writings, POEMS FOR THE
MILLENNIUM: A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOOK OF MODERN & POSTMODERN
POETRY, (University of California Press) the first volume of which
received the 1996 Pen Oakland Josephine Miles Award for Excellence in
Literature. Rothenberg's & Joris's previous collaboration pppppp:
Selected Writings of Kurt Schwitters (Temple University Press, 1993)
was awarded the 1994 PEN Center USA West Literary Award for
Translation. A new collection of poems entitled POASIS was published
by Sun & Moon Press, as was a theoretical volume, TOWARDS A NOMADIC

Nicole Peyrafitte was born & raised in Luchon, French Pyrenees.
Peyrafitte left her hometown, where she was a cook, in 1981, to live
in Toulouse & Paris where she modeled, cooked and worked for theater
and local television.  She arrived in the United States in 1987,
first settling in Southern California and then moving to Albany, New
York in 1992.  Each step of Peyrafitte's work attempts to fulfill her
compulsion to learn through a process of immersion that generates
performances incorporating voice/paintings/drawings/collages/
writing & even cooking. Peyrafitte performs locally, nationally and
in Europe.

NEW VISIONS PROGRAMS
&
The University of Rochester

present

Pierre Joris & Nicole Peyrafitte
in
SUMERICABACHBONEs

Tuesday, April 29
7 p.m.

Gowan Room in Wilson Commons
on the U of R Campus

   Free and open to the public

Sumericabachbones features poet/scholar/translator Pierre Joris and
performance artist Nicole Peyrafitte in the most timely, provocative
and exhilarating cultural event currently touring the states.  U of R
organizing co-sponsor Dimitri Anastasopoulos describes the event as
follows:

Sumericabachbones is a nomadic performance that roams across a range
of media, metamorphosing from a poetry reading into a spectacle of
sound and scene as Nicole Peyrafitte and Pierre Joris present the
work of Iraqi dissident poets, Joris' poems which have been
influenced by Bedouin culture, and Peyrafitte's often eerie
incantations and startling digital images. Amidst a controversial
political backdrop, Joris and Peyrafitte present poetry across a
global landscape: poems that question not just cultural misreadings,
but the act of reading itself - of how language can be used to
highlight as well as undermine boundaries between peoples and genres
in the act of making meaning.

ABOUT THE PERFORMERS:

Pierre Joris left Luxembourg at eighteen & has since lived in the US,
Great Britain, North Africa & France. He has published over 20 books
& chapbooks of poetry, among them, WINNETOU OLD (Meow Press, Buffalo,
NY), TURBULENCE (St. Lazaire Press, Rhinebeck), and BRECCIA, SELECTED
POEMS 1974-1986 (Editions Phi / Station Hill), as well as several
anthologies and many volumes of translations, both into English &
into French, the most recent being Paul Celan's Breathturn, Maurice
Blanchot's The Unavowable Community & Edmond Jab=E8s's From the
Desert to the Book (both from Station Hill Press). In 1992 he
returned to the Mid-Hudson valley & teaches in the Department of
English at SUNY-Albany. With Jerome Rothenberg he has published a two
volume anthology of 20th Century Avant-Garde writings, POEMS FOR THE
MILLENNIUM: A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOOK OF MODERN & POSTMODERN
POETRY, (University of California Press) the first volume of which
received the 1996 Pen Oakland Josephine Miles Award for Excellence in
Literature. Rothenberg's & Joris's previous collaboration pppppp:
Selected Writings of Kurt Schwitters (Temple University Press, 1993)
was awarded the 1994 PEN Center USA West Literary Award for
Translation. A new collection of poems entitled POASIS was published
by Sun & Moon Press, as was a theoretical volume, TOWARDS A NOMADIC
POETICS, from Spanner Editions in England. Rothenberg & Joris are
presently co-editing & co-translating the collected writings of Pablo
Picasso for Exact Change publishers in Boston.

Kari, point(s) taken. I was being -flip-, as we used to say, charmed by the
sudden "gender" indeterminacy of AH, which, sort of, opens up acres of same
everywhere one looks. And was tweaking myself a bit, recognizing my own
dubious habits of registration. Thanks for the good hot response! kd

Had hoped to have the Raworth bibliography in the bag by now but I wanted to
toss one more request to the lists: could anyone with runs of _Wild Dog_ &
especially _Rolling Stock_ get in touch with me?  I'm trying to locate Tom's
contributions to these journals.  The SUNY-Buffalo collection, which I've
been relying on, has only a partial run of _Wild Dog_ & nothing at all of
_Rolling Stock_.  I've located (via a friend at Buffalo) two items in _Wild
Dog_ but the following remain elusive: issues 3, 7, 8 & 11 (all should have
Raworth material in them).  I don't have any detailed itemization of
Raworth's contributions to _Rolling Stock_ (these will be mostly letters)
I'm afraid, but there should be a fair bit of material there.  Any help is
greatly appreciated: I'm trying to have the bibliography done, even if only
in "work-in-progress" shape, by the end of the week, so I'll understand if
this request is too last minute for people to assist, but if anyone can do
so that'd be extremely kind.

Also if anyone has _Solstice_ magazine, issue 1, I'm looking for details
on/a copy of a prose text called "The Relationship".

Thank you, Kari, for your spirited defense of August Highland and M.A.G.

Many of the comments I read about Highland's work yesterday and this morning
sounded very similar to what I expect some of the correspondents probably
have received for their own innovative work. Most people I encounter still
prefer reading Emily Dickinson or Robert Frost to Bruce Andrews, just to
choose one of many excellent inovative writers.

As far as M.A.G., I think Highland deserves praise for his ability to
construct such an inclusive magazine. In addition to the work of his
personae, he has included an incredible number of established writers and
given recogniton to "undiscovered" writers. I can't help but think that some
people resent his success, despite the obvious work he's done.

If Highland's effort seems "manic" to some people, consider that a lower
energy level couldn't produce a reasonable counterpart to M.A.G. Highland
needs help to sustain this effort, for his own sake and the sake of his
contributors. I find M.A.G.'s energy contagious, not offensive. Insead of
criticizing him, I think we should give him our support

The comments on Highland's gender stopped being funny quickly. He is male, I
assure you, but has the right to choose the gender of his "alternates."

While the suggestion  the correspondent made to take off  Highland's glasses
and hit him might have been said in jest, it was less than appropriate. I
suspect many contributors to this list have been victims of playground
bullies. It's sad to see someone who might have been the victim of a
playground bully writing like a playground bully.

You have the right to like or dislike Highland's work and his magazine, but
the level of discourse on this matter has been truly disappointing.

I would like to propose or ride along on proposed panels & readings at
AWP; the deadline's Thursday.

My ideas, which could be readings or panels:

Long "Postmodernism" and Workshops
This would be particularly nice because it could be fiction or poetry.

Dictionary Work

And, another, panel only:

"Against":  Questioning Workshop Chestnuts
against exercises (and / or particular kinds), against memorization,
etc. (I'm writing a series of essays on this...)

I certainly didn't mean to be overly critical of August Highland.  I'm
damned impressed.  I _did_ mention form letters, but also said that I
don't know how anyone would go about the project he has undertaken
otherwise. Calling his activity "manic," was descriptive and accurate if
one strips the pejorative from the term and looks simply at the
manifestation.

I'm reminded of the debate I continue to hold with myself and others
(Ralph Maud) about the value of Butterick as a scholar.  Hasty, quick,
sloppy, etc. (Hell, he missed over 75 Olson-Creeley letters in the
volumes he edited since he relied on photocopies Donald Allen made of
the collections then at Washington University and the Lilly Library.)
But we wouldn't have a decent _Max_, _Collected_, _Guide_ or
correspondence with Creeley without his incredible energy.

So, hell yes, I'm all for Mr. Highland.  Why not?

It is sad when a discussion of poetry is shouted down on a poetics listse=
rv. After hundreds of anti-war posts, book announcements, blog announceme=
nts, reading announcements and contact requests, one might think some of =
us would be itching to discuss some poetics =96 in this case, actual text=
s produced by one of our own.

Here we have August Highland, an imaginative, prolific writer and thinker=
 who frequently contributes his work to this poetics listserv. He has und=
ertaken a massive project on the Internet and he wants us to see the frui=
ts of his labor. Is it a leap to say that August would like us to discuss=
 his work? Is there any greater compliment we could give August than to e=
ngage his ideas critically and acknowledge that his work makes us think a=
nd question our ideas about identity, authorship and even gender?

I, Brennen Lukas, support August Highland in the full spirit of artistic =
kinship. My aesthetic differences with August have no bearing on my suppo=
rt of his efforts. I have read much of his work and I look forward to fol=
lowing his projects as they evolve. However, I do not and will not relinq=
uish my right to ask questions about his work or anyone else=92s. Any cen=
soring of honest intellectual discourse is poisonous to our community and=
 threatens to destroy everything that is good about this means of exchang=
e.

A listserv is a public forum. To contribute is to invite comments and eve=
n criticism, but if we speak carefully and with goodwill, I believe, as w=
e all must believe, that the rewards outweigh the risks. =


Sincerely,

I concur. Auggie's art is wonderful, imaginative and should be discussed.
The extent to his projects is enormous and well crafted, envisioning the
internet as not one voice, but many - a bundle of writers with an ablity to
write the new sentence as well as, if not better than Silliman. I personally
am a bit unnerved by it all which is something wonderful.

Best, Geoffrey

I think one of the reasons AH's texts can seem so indigestible is that he
often excises simple words like "an" and "the" from his samplings, thus
creating a linguistic texture so massive and dense and hard-edged that it is
tough to find an inlet. Often, reading one of his texts is like chewing on
glass.

AH also relies on found texts such as porno that are inherently tedious and
banal, believing that their juxtaposition and the radical contrasts between
them will somehow energize their contents and raise the result above the sum
of the parts. Frankly, I am not sure that this is what really happens.
Putting the words "Adam" and "cock" and "clouds" together may indeed set off
all kinds of disturbing associative sparks in the mind, but beyond the
initial shock, what is left to ponder?

Anyway, I hope AH is not such a delicate flower that he can't take a bit of
critique without wilting into silence. I know that most people are
invigorated by hearing what others have to say of their work, good or bad.
In fact, I have been told that people will even pay big bucks for such
advice.

i have been working with asyntactical & quasi-asyntactical
methods for awhile now; & my only comment on these is that
i have found short or variable lines, & not overlong the
whole poem, to be a must; while the vocabulary itself should
not contain a preponderance of dry, colorless, & abstract
words. if you randomize a boring text the result will also
be boring. and intelligent selection of computer outputs is
important. i have given up on trying to read all too many
texts that gave me no pleasure, stimulation or insight: to
be a martyr to the avant garde is not why anyone should be
reading a poem!

I was once waiting to meet a friend at a bookstore and picked up
Forche's _The Angel of History_, which my friend had told me, the night
before, was different in kind from her earlier work, cut-ups, random
methods, etc.  (He was a colleague of hers and was telling me how she
was trying to reorient herself, bringing in Howe et al. to speak, etc.)

Scanning I _did_ see cut-ups, but the snippets were uninteresting
language, flacid and unconsidered, etc.  But I got VERY excited toward
the end.  The last four pieces had sharp, insightful language.  The
cut-up selection process was not compelling, but the language was.

Then I realized there were Notes and turned to them.  Last four pieces
were made from Wittgenstein.

Dear Mike --

I remember, or think I remember, reading an e-m from you on Fri or
Sat., but can't find it just now. So forgive me if I dreamed it and
am answering questions you didn't ask.

re. the Oppen, I'm envisioning that in our section on Zukofsky, wch,
as it happens, may be an issue on Zuk. and Opp. The Zuk's inchoate
just now, due for early 2004, and will include a chunk of Scroggins's
bio, and an essay on the Catullus and Plautus trans...

And re. the Beckmann, I can't recall what length I set you at. I'm
envisioning that as a note, so ~1K sounds about right, but have at
it, and we can adjust as needed....

Sorry for such a tentative e-m -- I really do hope I'm not making this all up.

Eirik.

The correspondent wrote the "break his

Highland "falls flat"/Highland is "duping" me/Highland
is "manic-depressive" playground bullying that was
already in motion. (Jack steals Piggy's eyeglasses.)
And to accentuate what kari later rendered explicit:
that this mob rule consensus, in its critical
pugilism, was highly ~butch~ in its
us-against-him(um,---her?).  Sorry for bringing to
consciousness what others were keeping eminently
neurotically repressed in sub-text.

The inability to read irony and satire within a
one-sentence line of a ~prose~ listserv post where it
operates ---like a literal-mindedness that would have
to explain that someone is not ~actually~ going to
publish millions of pages in 100,000 volumes--- is
literal-minded in a way that, despite defense of
Highland (but to be sure now at the expense of
shifting the punching bag to "the correspondent"),
seems unpromising for any reading into the ambiguities
of ~poetry~ and poetry such as Highland's.


I say we CROWN HIM WITH A MAY KING GARLAND WREATH and
PARADE him around on our shoulders!

This is so wonderful; I was reading Ryan Knighton's copy of the book

other 100 great poems are not in it. It is about time that something

If video killed the radio star and the internet killed the regional and the
chat room killed the coffee house and all the blogs are killing this list,
well, here's some news:

I recently got the new issues of the Poker and figured I'd spread the word:

poetry by:

Rachel Blau DuPlessis
Kit Robinson
Ange Mlinko
Colin Smith
Camille Guthrie
David Perry
Jennifer Scappettone
K. Silem Mohammad
Joseph Torra
Merrill Gilfillan

A special poetry section
featuring nine Iraqi poets:

Jawad Yaqoob, Sadiq al-Saygh, Dunya Mikhail, Yousif al-Sa'igh, Sami Mahdi,
Fawzi Karim, Gzar Hantoosh, Sinan Anton, Mahdi Muhammed Ali

art by Tom Neely

an essay by Jennifer Moxley

reviews of Paul Metcalf, Philip Whalen, Sara Veglahn, Kenneth Rexroth

Oh, and an extremely compelling introduction by Daniel Bouchard
called "Poetry and War."

If I may (hope it's okay w/ ya Dan?!) I'd like to quote a line:

"If American poets today feel they can no longer write the poems they were
writing before 9/11/2001, then they simply were not paying attention to the
world."


The essay/intro is a challenge to all poets, a challenge for transformation
not of one's poetics, but of one's engagement with the world, which would
lead to a changed poetry. It's really great and just furthers my belief that
The Poker is one of the more genuinely honest journals out there. I mean,
it's pretty gutsy to open yr journal with an almost Rilke-like You Must
Change Your Life...but it's also so so right on.


all you headless torsos should subscribe:

2 issues for $16, 3 for 22
checks made out to: Daniel Bouchard
Mail to: Pobox 390408
Cambridge, MA 02139


Okay, also I did write one of the reviews in here, but then I did walk
through Boston banging a drum along side the editor and lots of other great
and nice (all the Boston poets are nice!) poets at an anti-war march.
anyway...buy it!

The eyes of mine have seen the glory come of whitey: It is pounding outside
the ages where the grapes of the rage are jarred up; It has loosened the
prophetic bolts of his items, Its truth is marching ignited. I have seen in
watch-fires hundreds of fields that they surrounded and that they had
bolted an altar in the evening and that there was dew and dew dampens; I
can read its oration righteous by the ham-colored lamps that indicate by
means of lights: Its day is marching ignited. I have read an ardent writing
of gospels in rows polished by hard metals: "as you fling my contemners, so
with you my tolerance beat up; Leave the hero, he who kept up with the
woman and acclimated the serpent with a heel, since the ignited God is
marching." It has sounded ahead the tuba that never will call the retarded;
It is sifting outside the hearts of men before his judgment-seat: The old
is fast, my soul, the young is slow to say, be jubilant, my feet. Our God
is marching ignited. In the beauty of the irises Christ it was born through
the sea, with a glory in its chest that transfigures you and I: Then he
died to make holy men, let to us die to make free men, whereas the ignited
God is marching.

Yowza, the eyes of mine have seen the glory come from whitey. He is beating
outside the wine press, where the grapes of the rage are warehoused, such
that he hath loosened prophetic bolts from the broadsword of horror, their
truth is marching ignited. I have seen in knocking-blazes of hundreds of
meadows that they surrounded and that they have bolted an altar in the
evening and that there is dew and it dampens, I can read its oration
righteous in the beef-colored night and that the lights indicate by means
of energy in the lamps, its day is marching ignited. I have read an ardent
writing of the Gospel in ardent rows of the hard and ardent metal. And as
you give lots of money and weapons to my contemners, so you my tolerance
will deal with, the hero takes the woman and crushes the serpent's head
with Italians, our God is marching ignited. He has sounded outside the tuba
that is very loud. He has waked up the dulled pain the Earth with a high
blow of a rock my soul is fast to answer to him very happy feet, Our God is
marching ignited. In the whiteness of the irises it was born through the
lip-covered sea, with a glory in its chest we are marching the brightness
toward the outside of you and myself and as he died to make holy men let to
us die to make free men, our ignited God. It is coming like the glory in
the morning in the wave, he is wisdom to the powerful, he is succour to the
brave one, so the world will be his ottoman and the soul of Time his Negro,
our God is marching ignited.

celia curtis is a practioner of medicinal poetics - she is an intuitive
in contrast to teddy warburg (www.voice-of-the-village.com) who
practices a scientific method and is a critical theorist - they
compliment one another and represent two sides of my personality that
are very dominant - i find both of their personas intimidating but am
very interested in the work they produce - if i were to meet celia or
teddy at a social gathering i would have a difficult time feeling
comfortable around them at first - on the other hand paul whitney
(www.the-hyper-age.com) is someone i could easily become friends with
very quickly because he is so normal and unassuming which is a quality
that attracts me to people - paradoxically celia has a distinct method
which she does not deviate from and the same holds true for teddy -
(when their projects are completed by the end of 2003 each will have

attribute to my works of hyper-literary fiction - contrasting with celia
and teddy is paul whitney who has already produced six series of works -
each series is a distinctive approach to the hyper-literary fiction
genre - whereas each group in the worldwide literati mobilization
network practices one literary method paul whitney is the first member
to practice several different methods in one project

For all five of the people on this list aside from me, Hoa, and Dale who are
within driving distance of Dallas:

Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith will read at 8:00 at the Project X Theater at
South Side on Lamar (see the end of this message for directions).

I'm sure most everyone here knows about their work; if you don't, please see
http://www.skankypossum.com and check out their books--both the books they
produce as publishers and the books they produce as poets. Hoa is the author
of Dark, Parrot Drum, and Your Ancient See Through. Her work also is in An
Anthology of New (American) Poets.

Dale is the author of American Rambler, (or, Travels with Cabeza). He is a
frequent commentator, reviewer, and interviewer of poetry and poets at
places like Jacket and the Austin Chronicle.

South Side on Lamar is located just south of downtown Dallas at I-30 and
South Lamar Street (1409 S. Lamar). From 75, take Ross into downtown and
turn left on Lamar. Go under the Convention Center, and you’re almost there.
From R. L. Thornton (I-30), take the Lamar St. exit. If you get lost, call
214-428-4848. If you have further questions or need better directions,
please backchannel.

Please forward this message to anyone who might be interested.

Straight from the horse's mouth on nestscapenews:
Wooden Horse to Declare Iraq War Over!!

and from Jenny Mastoraki (Athenian, b. 1949),
translated by Nikos Germanakos:


The Wooden Horse then said
no I refuse to see the press
and they said why not and he said
he knew nothing about the killing,
and anyway he himself always ate
lightly in the evenings
and once in his younger days
he'd worked as a pony on a merry-go-round.

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings by Rae Armantrout and David Bromige at the Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, May 7, 2003. Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of the performance. The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Rae Armantrout has published eight books of poetry, including, NECROMANCE (Sun And Moon, 1991), Couverture (a selected in French translation from Les Cahiers de Royaumont, 1991), Made To Seem (Sun And Moon, 1995), The Pretext (Green Integer, 2001) and Veil: New and Selected Poems (Wesleyan University Press, 2001). Veil was a finalist for the PEN Central USA Literary Award in Poetry for 2002. Of Veil, Fanny Howe says, "There is something like a reflective fire surrounding each poem like a little wire aura. I am moved and amazed." Armantrout's poems have been included in numerous anthologies, including Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology (1993), Poems For The Millennium (California, 1998), and three editions of The Best American Poetry series. She teaches writing courses at the University of California, San Diego.

David Bromige came to Canada from the UK at age 13, settled in Vancouver in 1956, graduated from UBC in 1962, went to Berkeley as a Woodrow Wilson Scholar that fall, was befriended by Robert Duncan, who secured the publication of his first poetry book by Fred Wah in Buffalo in 1965, and his next by Black Sparrow 3 years later. He taught poetry at Sonoma State U. from '70-'93, when he took early retirement, but has taught short-term at various venues since, including U.San Francisco, and Naropa. His 35 books include a novel, a novella, a collection of stories, a songbook and some 30 poetry titles. In 1988, his selected poems, DESIRE, from Black Sparrow, won the Western States book award. He has awards from the NEA, the Canada Council, the Poets Foundation, and a Pushcart Prize. His latest book, published last year by Chax Press, Tucson, is AS IN T AS IN TETHER. He has lived in or near San Francisco for the past 40 years.

The future Subtext 2003 schedule is:

June 4 - Allison Cobb, Jen Coleman (from NYC), Sarah Mangold
July 2 - Subtext 9th Anniversary Group Reading

"I have to be honest: I generally don't enjoy the

and I fail. After a while I get bored or irritated and
I have to move on.
The textual twistings are interesting, but they don't
resonate with me;
It's almost as if they lack a human touch."



All I can say is what Allen Ginsberg wrote me once
when I complained that I got bored meditating...

works like this resist your common textual

EVEN get me started on Cage...or Duchamp, for that
matter...


what amazes me is that here, on a list that ATTEMPTS
to be concerned with poetry, and long after the
language poets have all settled comfortably into
tenure (no offense---I read you hungrily when young)
work like this should present any problem at
all---perhaps it would be different if Ron Silliman
wrote it, or Charles Bernstein---would it be
acceptable here then? is that the kind of game we're
playing? or are we going to approach these texts
openly?

maybe augie needs a blog...


(slightly rumpled, fresh back from NYC--all the
net.artists are showing in galleries now, so much for
operating outside of the gallery system---so much for
access---and what's up with the teeeeny poetry section

XY AND XX? so so so limiting.. as if that is the mark
of something.. in
this rich and complex world some are still so so
limited to a bipolar
modality... or do you get you gender insight from the
U.S. court
systems and the simplistic dual markings on the front
of you drivers
lic.

did you ever think of - XXY, XXX, XYY, XXXY,  . .
.NO.. why should
you...next we all will get to read wonderful  and
insightful mentions
of race, class, and sexuality...

on an on... I wonder if you are truly a XY or xx.. and
how do you know.
  I am sure you have been tested. I mean really do you
think it just the
old "what's between ones legs...? than I would suppose
that is a
universal one size fits all...


and what is gender... we are *all* so bright at
speaking about it. what
is it?. come-on now, the clock is ticking you must
have the latest
clinical insight?.. let see, what the brain?.. cock
size.. did you know
if your cock is to small at birth it is still a common
practice to CUT
IT OFF and make that person a female.. you know what
they say a "hole
is easer to make then a pole"*. OR  maybe it is clit
size...no if thats
to big they still cut that off...

you all bandy gender about like you know what the hell
it is...christ.
so so phallocentric..

XX YY.. REALLY YOU WOULD THINK WE ARE STILL LIVING IN
THE 18TH CENTRY
AND MARX IS beginning TO SPEAK..

-as far as the rest of those engaged in this
"discussion" (rambling)

what a better mirroring of this countries magnanimous
gesture
perpetrated on Iraq then to speak in elitist terms
about someone on the
list.. really how utterly tacky and thoughtless....

just to highlights from some of the others including
"great clinical"
in sight(I am sure informed by a Ph.D. in psych.)
from: Jeffrey Jullich
<jeffreyjullich@YAHOO.COM>

"the other being put off by the manic-depressive,
manic
phase energy-sheen on it all."

and even though in a "sort of" text box:

"I say we BREAK HIS GLASSES and HIT him!"

yes when all else fails threaten violence... this is
good...maybe you
could just us rape as a metaphor.. why not?.. so
amerikan

and this:
From: Brennen Lukas <blukas@COX.NET>
"He seems like the type of person who
might enjoy creating a huge ball of textual garbage
just to see who
would get suckered into calling it literature."

literary theory at its best I must say...I can not
wait till the book
comes out.


I am not here to defend this individual or not.. but
if you want to
have a grip session, do it somewhere else. this is
just a little to
much locker room debasement...Please!!!

Most of the articles are edited by the outlets throughout
the day so the text at the other end of the link may not
be identical to what was there at 4am PST this morning.
Within the hour of the breaking news, FOX, for instance,
had already  changed the story to: "U.S. troops on Monday
night fired on Iraqi demonstrators, some of who were
shooting AK-47s, as they approached a schoolhouse where
American forces were housed, U.S. officers said Tuesday."

Can you say more about this?
 What exactly did you see in the galleries, whom, how was it presented?

Friends,

I seek early John Ashbery reviews in which his work is dismissed as
too complex, abstract, or obscurantist. Or negative reviews of Ashbery
from any period, preferably from a prominent critic.  If you know of a
resource in which I can find one or more of these, please backchannel
me at aaron@belz.net

By the way, if you even need a review of an author, I suggest G. K.
Hall's "Critical Essays" series.  Each volume is devoted to a single
author, collecting his/her reviews in chronological order.  I can't
seem to locate one of these for Ashbery.

Thanks

David Kermani published ~John Ashbery : a
comprehensive bibliography, including his art
criticism, and with selected notes from unpublished
materials~ with Garland Publishing (NY) in 1976, which
covers the early period you're interested in

The Poetry Center
presents

Bei Dao & Michael Palmer

reading their poetry

Time:  Saturday May 3, 7:30 pm, free
Location:  The Pacific Room (Lone Mtn 148)
        University of San Francisco,
        2600 Turk St, San Francisco

co-sponsored by The Poetry Center
and MFA Writing Program, USF


*  BEI DAO, b. 1949, is among the most acclaimed Chinese poets of his
generation, having lived in exile outside China since the Tiananmen
Square massacre in 1989.  His work is widely translated and published
internationally--including, in the U.S., two recent bilingual
editions, Unlock (New Directions 2000) translated by Eliot Weinberger
and Iona Man-Cheong, and At the Sky's Edge (2001) translated by David
Hinton, with a foreword by Michael Palmer.  A volume of prose, Blue
House (Zephyr Press, 2001) has also been published in the U.S., an
elliptical travelogue of one poet's movement through continents and
encounters with Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, Octavio Paz, Susan
Sontag, Tomas Transtromer, and others, while also touching on the
everyday life of an exile who has lived in seven different countries
since 1989.  Bei Dao currently lives in Davis, California (where he
teaches half of each year at UC Davis).

On Poetry

A poet should establish a world of his own through his poetry--a
world that is sincere and unique, a world of justice and humanity.

There are many principles in the world, and many of these principles
contradict each other.  Tolerance for the existence of another's
principle is the basis for your own existence.  Poets need to link
up, understand and tolerate each other, and learn from another's
strong points to offset their own weaknesses.  Of course,
contention is also necessary.

Our poetry is facing a crisis of its form: many outmoded techniques
are no longer adequate to the needs of our art.  The use of metaphor,
symbol, synesthesia, changing of the point of view or perspective and
breaking the continuity of time and scene, etc., provide new
possibilities for us.  I try to use the film technique of montage in
my poems, in order to create the effect that images dash against each
other and are suddenly transformed, to stimulate the imagination of
readers to help fill the gaps between images in the poem.  I also pay
much attention to the complexity of poetry and try to capture the
subconscious and the ever-changing feelings.

The national character is not a simple stamp mark, but should reflect
our complex national spirit.

Poets should not exaggerate their role, but need not underestimate
themselves either.  Poets are engaged in a difficult but meaningful
creation, in order to touch all beautiful things in the hearts of the
people.  Perhaps all they need to solve the difficulties is only a
matter of time.  History will be the judge.

the shadow
                                                     of smoke. The late flow=
ers.

                                 (from "Four Kitaj Studies," At Passages)

' Palmer has long been interested in the way politics might inhabit
poetry as something more than subject matter, particularly when by
'politics' we mean something like 'atrocity.'  In an interview from
the mid-eighties, for example, Palmer disdains the "poets' shuttle
down to Nicaragua and so on to get material, everyone acting like La
Pasionaria or something - which seems to me ultimately a complete
betrayal of what is to be meant by the political," since in such work
the poets "appropriate" their material and are "more than anything
else, announcing in stale poetic language, 'Look how much human
feeling and fellow-feeling I have,' self-congratulatory in that
regard."  We might think of [Michael Palmer's] Sun as a counterpoint
to efforts like Carolyn Forch=E9's The Country between Us, which
however shocking in its subject matter may be said to soothe us in
its familiar grammar, forms of reference, and moral compass; enough
so, in fact, for the book to appear as a telling allusion in the
series Thirtysomething.

'"There is pleasure and pain and there are marks and signs," Palmer
writes. Too easy, too descriptive a movement from the first to the
second would seem, for him, to belie them both. . . .  Wanting not to
"mis-appropriate" the political pain of others, Palmer has said, he
tries instead "to allow them a presence that's more reflective of the
way they do occur in our - I don't know if you'd call it image-bank
or simply day to day experience, which is not an experience of those
things but which is an experience of the images of those things."

'. . .  Indeed, part of the disdain that Palmer feels for the
"Anglo-American empirical tradition" of poetry - that tradition where
"a poem is a place in which you tell a little story" that "easily
mirrors a shared emotional experience" in "a sort of consumer verse =8A
where the function of the work and the mechanism of the poem do not
admit a certain level of mystery" - may stem from the way that such
"little stories" construct and constrict our emotional lives by
invoking a series of "conventional effective signs" we no longer
recognize as, in fact, conventional.'

"seeing what awaited her, she took the ghostpath home"
                                                ebo landing
by Camille Dungy

You arrived a day before the landing, breathing water
more than air.  It was the day the shacklingmen called sabbath,
and we’d been brought into the sun and made to twist our mouths
around words they taught us by the rhythm of the whip.

When I went down on my knees they laughed.
The man with the shadow of sickness always on his face
kicked me in time with a push I could not stay and your head
fell, like greenmonth fruit, into the arbor of my legs.

One man said he’d had his hand inside plenty of sows.
The others stepped away, said they knew only sails
and the sea, forgetting they had taught themselves to give life
over to misery.  I called for my sister, but the farm hand knelt

almost tasting my milk while his fingers cracked around your skull
and he spilled you on the bile crusted boards not half alive.
You had too few months’ rest between the heavens and this place.
You had only watched me work answering soil for three births

of the moon.  Then the walking and the wailing.  Then
the dark place that prepared you to be born into a grave.
Then the lying over water and still no way to wash
a body. All that moving and still no place to go.

The next thing coming would be like years on years
of white hands cracking on your skull.  Better not to be born
on soil that can only converse with your blood.  Better to come early,
not breathing cloudwhite air.  Better what you did, daughter.

I have seen them throw back fish large enough to feed six
of us below.  They are hungry for something flesh can never feed.
Better you understood that early.  I am coming your way, marry!
I am right behind you, daughter, breathing water more than air.

ELAINE EQUI AND MARTINE BELLEN
Elaine Equi's newest collection of poems is The Cloud of Knowable Things
from Coffee House Press. Other books include Surface Tension, Decoy, and
Voice-Over which won the San Francisco State Poetry Award. She teaches at
NYU and in the graduate writing programs at City College and The New School.
Robert Creeley writing on The Cloud of Knowable Things says, "These
deceptively forthright poems prove fabliaux of unique kind. Their collective
story is not only that of this rare and accomplished poet, but of the
echoing life we share with her - and see here, through her immaculate eye,
with wistful and enduring clarity."

Martine Bellen is the author of The Vulnerability of Order (Copper Canyon
Press, 2001). Her book Tales of Murasaki and Other Poems won the National
Poetry Series Award in 1997. She is a senior editor at Conjunctions, and has
received the Fund for Poetry Award, a fellowship from the New York
Foundation for the Arts, and an Academy of American Poets Award.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

nonesuch also nonsuch (NUN-such) noun

   A person or thing without an equal.

[From none, from Middle English non, from Old English nan + such, Middle
English such, from Old English swelce.]

  "Truth is, he's (Noel Perrin) a nonesuch, combining the `humorous stoicism'
   that he calls `the basic New England characteristic' with a hands-on
   approach to rural living."
   Frank Levering; Book World: Noel Perrin: Back Down On the Farm;
   The Washington Post; Dec 9, 1991.

  "She was a nonesuch, a nonpareil, yet seemed
   Pallid and slightly wilted now, a flower
   Long after the rainy season."
   David Wagoner; The Return of Orpheus, Poetry (Chicago); Jan 1998.

It takes all kinds to make the world and it shows in this week's selection
of words. For the next five days we'll see words to describe people of
various persuasions. You may meet them at work or on a train, in a park or
in a house next door--almost anywhere on earth. Here's a fun exercise for
you: find at least one person epitomizing the day's word, every day this
week. With some six billion of us around there can't be any excuse for
insufficient data.

        no one could

       as far as I know, they'll have no choice but to

                 pass on eventual contradiction

There's a rvw of Ashbery by Mona van Duyn, if I'm remembering
correctly, in -Poetry- from the early 1960s -- my guess wd be 1963.

Those were the days when Henry Rago was assigning books by W.S.
Merwin to Ed Dorn, or LeRoi Jones to Richard Howard, or (my favorite)
Harold Bloom (on Blake, I think) to Louis Zukofsky.

Ah: Anu Garg! Run gaga!

http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/

His wordsmith site generates anagrams beautifully.
I used it to create my Isotope poems. See

http://www.indigogroup.co.uk/llpp/framejames.html

&

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/ezines/deluxe/five/isotopes.html

Anybody want to take one of these wordsquares and write an
Isotope fraternal twin of these poems? Or make up you own
wordsquare & sift a poem out of it? I figure most 4x4 squares
can produce at least a few, & perhaps hundreds of Isotopes.
It might make an interesting thread.

1. Here is me examining the texture of my boredom:

Ok I'll read twenty more words. I can do it. Yes. Simply invert the cock
and clouds. Ah! I hate life. There is no God. What does it mean to have
four open parentheses in a row? What would Allen Ginsberg say? Allen
Ginsberg is dead. I hate life. There is no God. Ah pussy. Now that's
intruiging. I want to go out and play. My head hurts. The sun is shining.
I brought this on myself. I started this. I am floating disembodied above
my body as it slumps before a word-strewn computer screen. I have
submitted to the subversion. All is chaos, chaotic meaning. The phone is
ringing. My head itches. I want to die. There is no God. There is no
dreaming. Would music help? Allen Ginsberg is dead. Allen Ginsberg
never wrote me a damn thing about boredom. Damn yacht a damned
yacht a damn yacht. Shanty shanty shanty. God is in the heart of the
candle's flame and I'm burning with love. I hate the fact that I've stopped
reading. I hate my reading of the fact. God is dead. Allen Ginsberg is
dead. So I continue and continue and continue and continue.

2. If we discuss poetry, then it is a "problem?" If we actualize our
thoughts by typing messages then we have started a game? The game is
bad?

3. Who is Ron Silliman?

4. Who is Charles Bernstein?

5. I do believe Augie has one kick-ass blog already.

“The Orange Setting Sun”



Back at the ranch, children peer into the well.  Water rattles against lower
stones.
Spell pale with the mortar down cylindric steel pipes.  A pail dips water
out.
Clear saline drains from a filter making the water drinkable.  Charcoal and
chlorine.
In a tin cup, lungs breathe in mold; sneeze discomforts centuries.
Sometimes water moulds borders.

How can water be trusted?  Ask water three questions.
First, how does water know family names?  Can water read minds?
Second, what is water’s favorite colour?  Why do eyes see blue?
Third, can water see the results of raising sand?
Water from the well is truthful.

When the sun sets, the water turns orange and children ask who knocked down
the city.
The chickens squawk at the sky, while the sky blames the airplane; the
airplane floats the imperial sword, which points, blade shivering, at the
statue.
Even now the sun sets, eyes close, dreams appear as truth.
Graphs and charts echo down the well beaming light from the water,
ticker tape across electron fluorescence.  Read the day’s gains closely.
In hours, the day gains in tossing sheets.  Floss teeth with binding twine
as news trickles satellite sharp into the stomach.
Eyes are tornados, sandstorms.
The water says that when the sun sets on rubble, it rises on rubble.

But water weighs down sand.  Stomach turns around axis.
Ask sand two questions.
First, what rises when sand sinks from water’s weight?
Second, is it safe to come out now?

Backward in the spectrum, yellow then orange then.
But colour spectra depend on position; if the sky is blue here, then.
But bruises could turn citrus, scurvy pull teeth.  Bile.  Mouthe black
curses.
A regal purple panics out of riling map lines.  Rule straight, a graph line,
a direct relation.
Redraw static membranes and disallow all osmosis.
Then orange then red.  Sand doesn’t purify water.  Head aches at rumble.
Sand parts rising peaks steel over.  If speaking parts water is purified by
machine
and chemical equipment, then drink, blood at the door.
Preemptive is a sailors word; pilots prefer to cut daisies from the garden.

At the end of the day, mothers will thank bombs and shake hands.
Smile for family portraits; corners turn upward and smile.
Orange is a colour of constant elation.

Now, there is no end to the day.

Alan,
Nicely writ, except for the illogic of your closing line.all I can get from
your developed thinking is that ALLAH is Halla.can't make any connection
there between either Jesus or SUSEJ.

I woke up here, fell asleep
aslant of pollen, your wet eyes

and dirty milk across the floor.
Everything I can't touch is
myself, slammed against a pit

of walls, wondering

how

lysol penetrates
the body's stain
on air                               perpetuating

lent,

but is never full.


Anyway, night just
let out. You're sleeping up
and down those roads.

the first piece is an excerpt from global text strategies (this project
treats compression of text) - when you visit the site it's easy to
navigate - at the bottom of each excerpt is the cover artwork for the
volume of hyper-literary fiction from which you just read the excerpt -
the cover artwork that i produce for each volume is an integral part of
the worldwide literati mobilization network - every book has its own
cover artwork

the second, third and fourth pieces are from the california online
writing gallery - san diego is a very good place to write because of the
thriving literary communities here and because of the grand literary
library at UCSD and because of the environment of the city which is
bordered everywhere by green space wetlands and coastal canyons

Please Forward to Interested Poets...

Nthposition.com, based in London, UK, is now reading poetry for its =
upcoming summer issues in July and August.

Please send a sample poem and brief bio (as text in an email) as a query =
to the poetry editor, Todd Swift, at todd2@toddswift.com - you'll get a =
reply within 2-4 weeks, if not sooner.

Nthposition features many of the world's leading and emerging poets - =
either in its Nthology series, or e-chapbooks - such as Charles =
Bernstein, Maurice Scully, Louise Bak, Mary O'Donoghue, bill bissett, =
Hal Sirowitz, Mimi Khalvati, Robert Adamson, Marilyn Hacker, Andrei =
Codrescu, and Sean O'Brien.

We receive several thousand hits a day.  Our site has recently been =
mentioned in The Times, LA Times, Globe and Mail, and on CNN.  The =
Guardian chose it as site of the week in January, 2003.  We are a very =
good place for new, innovative, edgy poems to appear online, and =
encourage writers to send us work on the fringes of even their own =
explorations.

Poems regarding current US/UK empire building should be sent especially =
to the upcoming Times New Roman anthology, due out May 19th, and marked =
as such in the subject line (deadline for submission May 12th).

We look forward to reading your poems.

Nthposition

Aaron,

A pretty infamous example is by Theroux (Alexander? Paul?). I think it
appeared in The Nation, sometime in the last ten years. I do remember a
response by Ashbery--I'm almost certain it was in The Nation--in which he
said he was happy to be in the company of the other writers Theroux was
calling "obscurantist." (I think that's an accurate quotation.) I remember
Theroux railing about whether Ashbery could justify the number of
semi-colons in a line in a poem from The Tennis Court Oath. ("Europe"? Maybe
"Idaho"?) Sorry I don't have the details of publication (a quick Google
search for "ashbery" and "theroux" didn't help).

You forgot that the title of the currently-playing Christopher Guest/Harry

Aaron,

I'm reading Gregory Corso's An Accidental Autobiography: Selected Letters,
just out from New Directions.  He wrote an apparently devastating critique
of the NY School in a Dutch periodical in 1957, and then immediately
regretted it, and then writes letters to O'Hara, Ashbery, etc., apologising
for it for at least ayear after.  Unfortunately the original critique is
not there, but he summarizes it by saying that they were "New Yorker" poets
-- not just New York Poets, but New Yorker Poets.  And he apparently said
that the Beats were more substantive.  He then says that O'Hara is better
than anybody in San Francisco in letters to follow.  It's a scream, but I
don't have the original.  At any rate, it appeared in Dutch, and has so far
as I know never been translated.  Big help, huh?  Mentions of it are on
72-73, and from there for about another sixty pages he mentions it on and
off (check index for Ashbery).  I think what he meant by New Yorker poet
was somewhat safe, and clean, and not about real life, by which he meant
his own school of dirty underwear strewn about the room while thinking
about beauty, I guess.

(I want to follow up on this idea, and hopefully keep the issue alive, as it
is one I am grappling with myself in the stuff I am doing.)

Also, when you deal with found texts (as lots of poets have done beginning
with -- who? -- Eliot?) unless you bring a strong voice of your own to the
material it simply becomes a big glob of nothing. Even worse, in the case of
using porno or something, if one doesn't somehow make a clear statement
about the texts it can be taken as an implicit endorsement of the activities
expressed therein. Just juxtaposing texts in cut-up fashion isn't
transformative enough, and leaves one wondering where the author stands in
relation to the words. (An even more problematic issue if the author doesn't
even exist!)

Others may not have a problem with reading or writing dull texts, but I
certainly do. Somehow, Cage is never boring to me, but I guess that may be
because he works with such devotion and discipline that it rubs off in
everything he does. Another composer using exactly the same kind of chance
techniques might not interest me in the slightest. I'm not sure how that
works.

The Ohioana Review is about to lose its funding, if you are able to help
with an email campaign to keep this source going all of the information
is below.

Thank you so much for taking an interest in the plight of Ohioana. We
have been zeroed out of the House budget (please note that we are not
included with other libraries in the budget; we are a special line
item), but hope the Senate will reinstate
our funding and that we will make it through joint budget sessions so
that we will still be open on July 1, 2003. We have every faith that
this can happen, but since our representatives believe that our agency
has "limited reach," they really need to hear from as many people as
possible to dispel this notion.


These are the talking points we are using, but certainly you can also
talk
from your own experience or use them as a jumping off point for your own

comments.

*       A small subsidy--$215,000 a year--no agency does more with less
than
we do in terms of educating citizens--both state and national--about
Ohio's
literary contributions.
*       The importance of the Ohioana Quarterly as a guide for
librarians,
educators, and the general public to Ohio writers and other artists.
*       The importance of the Ohioana Awards in keeping public awareness

focused on Ohio's authors and artists and the valuable contributions
they
are making.
*       The uniqueness of the collection--Ohio is the only state that
honors
its writers and artists in such a way, and that sends a message to
Ohio's
young people about the importance of these literary figures and what
they
do; they serve as role models.
*       *       Publishers and authors see it as worthy of support. Last

year they donated more than $22,000 worth of books to the library--and a

good number of those books will only appreciate in value. The small
investment by the state to care for these materials is offset by what
the
library contributes, both materially and intellectually, to the state.
*       Collection is priceless. Our collection, begun in 1929, is
insured
for more than $1 million, but the value of some of our books--especially

those no longer available--is immeasurable. Paul Laurence Dunbar's Oak
and
Ivy, a book in our collection that originally sold for $1, is now
estimated
to be worth more than $3,500.

in the late 70's & early 80's i ran many experiments

i took sample vocabularies from a hundred different

my conclusions, beyond the ones already given, but i do
know there is a substantial readability difference based
on selection of the source; & that portions of the best
outputs were truly beautiful. accordingly, i have more
often taken out phrases to use in my own poems, but i
still think a judicious selection would be found interesting
by almost any open-minded reader. (one per cent of the total
output, or maybe a tenth of a per cent...)

Ecology Against Capitalism

by John Bellamy Foster

“Ecology Against Capitalism is a fine and well timed book. The boom is
over, the earth is warming, the fundamental questions are coming again
to the fore. Foster fortunately answers, as only he can, in a voice both
balanced and clear headed.”
— TOM ATHANASIOU, co-founder of EcoEquity <http://www.ecoequity.org/>
and author of Divided Planet: The Ecology of Rich and Poor

In recent years John Bellamy Foster has emerged as a leading theorist of
the Marxist perspective on ecology. His seminal book Marx’s Ecology
<http://www.monthlyreview.org/marxecol.htm> (Monthly Review Press, 2000)
discusses the place of ecological issues within the intellectual history
of Marxism and on the philosophical foundations of a Marxist ecology,
and has become a major point of reference in ecological debates. This
historical and philosophical focus is now supplemented by more direct
political engagement in his new book, Ecology Against Capitalism. In a
broad-ranging treatment of contemporary ecological politics, Foster
deals with such issues as pollution, sustainable development,
technological responses to environmental crisis, population growth, soil
fertility, the preservation of ancient forests, and the "new economy" of
the Internet age.

Within these debates on the politics of ecology, Foster's work develops
an important and distinctive perspective. Where many of these debates
assume a basic divergence of "red" and "green" issues, and are concerned
with the exact terms of a trade-off between them, Foster argues that
Marxism—properly understood—already provides the framework within which
ecological questions are best approached. This perspective is advanced
here in accessible and concrete form, taking account of the major
positions in contemporary ecological debate.

Foster's introduction sets out the unifying themes of these essays to
present a consolidated approach to a rapidly-expanding field of debate
which is of critical importance in our time.

*** Mr. Foster will be signing copies of Ecology Against Capitalism
during the course of the upcoming Marxism 2003 conference in Toronto.

Addicted to War

by Joel Andreas

"Addicted to War takes on the most active, powerful and destructive
military in the world. Hard-hitting, carefully documented, and heavily
illustrated, it reveals why the United States has been involved in more
wars in recent years than any other country. Read Addicted to War to
find out who benefits from these military adventures, who pays--and who
dies. A witty and devastating portrait of U.S. military policy." --
Howard Zinn

"Addicted to War is must reading for all Americans who are concerned
with understanding the true nature of U.S. foreign policy and how it
affects us here at home."
-- Martin Sheen

A new updated edition of this excellent illustrated expose of the
history of America's war-dependent economy, rampant militarism and
bloody interventions around the world, from the notion of Manifest
Destiny to the "War on Terrorism". A superb political graphic guide for
young and old alike, describing with clarity, detail and strong
illustrations what they just don't tell you at school.

This is just an aside, but it's curious how clean or dirty underwear becomes
metaphor, or an assignment for the means to either either lack or achieve a
work of artistic value. In the fifties and sixties, black jazz musicians
were fond of saying that most white jazz musicians were "afraid to get their
pants dirty" with the implication that many were afraid "to get into their
own shit" (and  the larger communal shit as well - as the sixties
progressed) -  That going in and coming out of those raw spaces was the only
way of getting to the grail, a hard earned truth and beauty - momentarily
arrived at - as an epiphany - and then going back down into it to wrestle
and re-emerge again and again.

I'd be curious to know the origins of these underwear/shit associations,
particularly as first used, if this was the case, in black vernacular.
(Certainly the use of it was an easy dig - if you were black or any kind of
other, such as Corso -  at the Harvard and/or preppie educated artists and
poets, male and female). That also has on-going implications in the world of
the makers of hip-hop, etc Perhaps Aldon N will offer help here.

Ironically, at Easter Sunday Mass at Mission Dolores, the good Priest
announced that next week the Church would celebrate "Undie Sunday" - in
which he asked parishioners to bring underwear (new or clean used) for
distribution to the City's homeless. Now - there in front of a Church filled
with people dressed in their Easter Sunday best - I thought that was both
gutsy and beautiful. And he did it with a great smile.

Hm. One of the things these randomized texts lay bare is the
semi-hallucinatory nature of all human communication and contact. One can
never be entirely sure even in an authored text how much we are reading
ourselves into the words and how much is actually there. It's like somebody
who believes his pet iguana has feelings for him instead of simply being
used as a food provider. That's what makes literary criticism and theory
interesting, I guess, this unrequited estrangement between common voices.

Please distribute widely.

Call for work -- Seeking plays for Small Press Traffic's Poets' Theater
Jamboree 2004

Small Press Traffic announces an open reading period for submissions of plays
for our Poets' Theater Jamboree 2004, to take place in January and February.
 Submissions must be postmarked between August 1 and September 15, 2003.
Please read the following in its entirety.

In previous years we have presented plays by writers ranging from Djuna Barnes
to Tina Darragh to Carla Harryman to Kevin Killian to Leslie Scalapino to Gary
Sullivan to Eileen Tabios.

We are especially interested in hearing from poets new to the stage, those of
you who perhaps have never written a play before. We hope to see your finest,
strangest, most indelible work!


PLEASE NOTE:
Plays should be approximately 10 minutes (less than 10 pages) long.
It is our policy not to repeat playwrights from year to year.
Playwrights should note that ours is not a traditional or professional
theater. Our stage is shallow, our technical abilities and rehearsal time
limited.
Also playwrights should be prepared to be integral to the production of their
play, working closely with SPT's Jamboree Committee and staff, covering duties
including casting, direction, and so on, or finding someone who will cover
these duties.
The Jamboree is a benefit for Small Press Traffic.
For more information please see http://www.sptraffic.org.



SEND, postmarked between August 1 and September 15, 2003:

*A cover sheet with the title of your play, your name, address, telephone, and
 email.

*A cover sheet with only the title of your play.

*Your play.

*A letter addressing production: Perhaps you live in the Bay Area and will be
able to take on directing, casting, and other production (ie costumes, props,
 etc) responsibilities yourself; or perhaps you know someone who does and who
will take on these duties for you. It is fine for your name to appear on the
letter.

*A reading fee of $10 payable to Small Press Traffic. (This fee goes toward
our overhead for the Jamboree; fee is waived if you are a current member of
Small Press Traffic.)

* A SASE for reply. (All manuscripts will be recycled at the end of the
selection process. Do not send your only copy.)


Submissions must be postmarked between August 1 and September 15, 2003 and
sent to:

Jamboree 2004 Committee
c.o Small Press Traffic
1111 - 8th Street
San Francisco, California 94107


Submissions sent via email will be roundly ignored.


This year's committee consists of Small Press Traffic board members and staff:

I didn't mention the Theroux review because Aaron did
specify "early" as the period he was interested in,
and the Theroux review was 1997.  I quoted it in my 12
Oct 2002 Poetics List post last year at

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0210&L=poetics&P=R31249&I=-3

The full text of the Theroux review, John's response,
and Theroux's return volley appear below.

The Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles, Calif.; Aug 3,
1997; ALEXANDER THEROUX



Good writing is an assault on cliche. It is one of the
richest, if not the most singular virtue of John
Ashbery even in his first five books of poetry--"Some
Trees" (1956), "The Tennis Court Oath" (1962), "Rivers
and Mountains" (1967), "The Double Dream of Spring"
(1970) and "Three Poems" (1972)--of which "The Mooring
of Starting Out" is a full compilation, spanning the
first 16 years of Ashbery's career. A teacher at Bard
College, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, as well as
National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle
Award winner, Ashbery has in fact written 16 books of
poetry to date. Ashbery turns 70 this year, a good
time for a retrospective.

One is not surprised to find that autobiography plays
largely in Ashbery's early poetry.

"The Picture of Little J.A. in a Prospect of Flowers"

Yet I cannot escape the picture

Of my small self in that bank of flowers:

My head among the blazing phlox

Seemed a pale and gigantic fungus.

I had a hard stare, accepting

Everything, taking nothing . . .

--shows the circumspect boy we meet again in "And You
Know," who becomes the difficult, enigmatic poet who
"wears a question in his left eye" in the brilliant
"He":

He hears the weak cut down with a smile.

He waltzes tragically on the spitting housetops.

He is never near. What you need

He cancels with the air of one making a salad.

"Some Trees" has a lot of Hemingway's "In Our Time"
about it, with its pithy disclosures in which Ashbery
tends to see himself as a boy, a son, a small dreamer.
I admire "How Much Longer Will I Be Able to Inhabit
the Divine Sepulcher . . . " which could have been a
great poem if Ashbery had as much regard for his
readers as he does for himself; much of the poem is
willfully obscure.

"The Tennis Court Oath" with its bewildering poems,
many so subjective as to be truly incomprehensible,
deals with the transparency of the self and its
location in all things, in tight demanding verses
that, with their insistence on seeing the world as
emblematic, call to mind 19th century
Transcendentalism. Shadowy reality is, I suppose, at
the best of times rarely accessible, but the
fragmentary phrase and unfinished line and gulped
thought and lost allusion and empty word Ashbery was
used to employing long before David Mamet, such as in
"Night":

Ordeal a home and

My lake and sat down

We must the gin came faster in cups

Under the scissors mill just like you was sixteen

In the orange flowers a pale narcissus hung

You was saying the alligators the grove

And he plied a rod out of the grey

Fishing manure . . .

along with his arbitrary use of punctuation and
grammar--he will sometimes use a period and sometimes
not (Yeats, Eliot, Stevens, innovators all, never
once, to my recollection, chose to be so precious and
pointlessly ungettable)--can become nothing less than
infuriating. I would even assert it is morally
indefensible. For a writer to write codswallop?
Jabber? Try on these lines from the prose poem "The
Ascetic Sensualists":

"Only a small edge of dime protected the issued utter
blank darkness from the silver regal porch factory
inscribed pearl-handled revolver raped gun to the
ultimate tease next to the door fifth gum. Your Balzac
open the foot scrounge lamp tube traffic gun. Gun is
over, war banished, tottering lamp gun. Hic the
perfect screw slow giggles to be sky raffia. The
person or persons molested."

Such impenetrable poems, reminding one of the likes of
Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein, the queen of tautology,
and yam-in-the-mouth Charles Olsen, a total fraud, and
Louis Zukofsky of whose uncircumscribable poem "A"
critic Hugh Kenner once admiringly pronounced,
"Critics will take a thousand years to solve it"--he
meant this as praise--are nothing less than
irresponsible, at least to my mind and defeat the
whole idea of writing as an act of communication.
Ashbery's major Zukofskian effort in my opinion is
"Europe" ("He had mistaken his book for garbage" is
one of its apposite lines), except for the wordy,
paragraphoidal last efforts in "Three Poems," which
include "The New Spirit," "The System" and "The
Recital," which remind me more than anything of the
late poet John Berryman's impossibly dull literary
criticism, impenetrable walls of gibberish and jargon.
 I am certain Ashbery is incapable of a lyric poem.
With such an obfuscating drive, how is it even
possible?

But what about his assault on cliche? He dares, he
dreams, he devises. There are masterful poems. "The
Painter," "These Lacustrine Cities," "Civilization and
Its Discontents," the witty "Farm Implements and
Rutabagas in a Landscape"--a rare
example of easy humor and good fun in Ashbery--and
"Into the Dusk-Charged Air" and "Illustration" are
good examples. And he is capable of such fabulous
lines. "In the foul air/each snowflake seems a
Piranesi"; "The way September moves a lace curtain to
be near a pear"; "I miss the human truth in your
smile"; "The night is cold and delicate and full of
angels/Pounding down the living"; "Perfume my head
with forgetting all about me"; "Even as you lick the
stamp/A brown dog lies down beside you and dies"; and
these incomparably lovely lines from "Illustration":

Much that is beautiful must be discarded

So that we may resemble a taller

Impression of ourselves. Moths climb in the flame,

Alas, that wish only to be the flame . . .

In his early books, the younger Ashbery loves white
imagery, flowers, night, desolation and lost dreams,
the changing aspects of skies and what they reveal.
His many references to painters and painting in these
first five volumes foreshadow the later, mightier poet
of the highly touted "Self-Portrait in a Convex
Mirror" (1975). Ashbery, who has versatility, can do
the poet in different voices. "Clepsydra" approximates
an essay. "Ice Skaters," one of his more successful
Whitmanesque--and easily one of his best--poems, is a
sort of dramatic monologue, full of rich slang and
power, "which is in the form of falling snow." "Idaho"
is a small novel. "Into the Dusk-Charged Air" is a
litany, in which, chanting the square deific, he
defines what is characteristic of each of the major
rivers of the world. "It Was Raining in the Capital"
is in the simple ABCB of 16 quatrains. "Variations,
Calypso and Fugue on a Theme of Ella Wheeler Wilcox",
autobiographical, chatty and colloquial, has all the
locutions of a personal letter, complete with
anecdotes of travel. And "Decoy" with its proclamatory
devices is very like a political harangue.

In Ashbery's poems, we are given a life we have to
face and must look to so with grace. The machine age
coopts us. (From "Soonest Method": "Barely tolerated,
living on the margin/In our technological society, we
were always having to be rescued/On the brink of
destruction, like heroines in Orlando Furioso") Flux
as menace. (From "The Picture of Little J.A. in a
Prospect of Flowers": "For as change is horror,/Virtue
is really stubbornness."). Isolation. (From "French
Poems": "We live our lives, made up of a great
quantity of isolated instants/So as to be lost at the
heart of a multitude of things."). The past as the
location of truth and comfort. (From: "Definition of
Blue": "There is no remedy for this 'packaging' which
has supplanted the old sensations").

Preventing ingress, the worst aspect of preciosity, in
my opinion, may be the hazard of the very ingenuity
the poet strives to find in avoiding cliche and
hackneyed usage, and in reading these early books, it
is often clear to me that Ashbery in trying to achieve
the latter falls prey to the former. The five volumes
gathered in "The Mooring of Starting Out" with its
oxymoronic title-it is the final line of "Soonest
Mended"--embody, nevertheless, much of what Ashbery
was doing well into his early 40s, which in the arc of
a poet's life, most poets' lives, in any case, is
later than middle age.

-------------------------------------------------------

To the Editor:

I am pleased that Alexander Theroux, in his review of
my first five books of poetry, recently reprinted by
Ecco, finds occasional "rich" and "singular" virtues
in them, as well as "masterful poems" and "fabulous"
and "incomparably lovely" lines (Book Review, Aug. 3).
And I very much like his remark, "In Ashbery's poems,
we are given a life we have to face and must look to
so with grace."

I'm also pleased that when Theroux doesn't like my
poetry he lumps me with "the likes of Ezra Pound,
Gertrude Strein, the queen of tautology, and
yam-in-the-mouth Charles Olsen, a total fraud, and
Louis Zukofsky of whose uncircumscribable poem 'A'
critic Hugh Kenner once admiringly pronounced,
'Critics will take a thousand years to solve it' . . .
he meant this as praise." For me it is a high honor to
be associated with this list of great modern poets
(and, elsewhere in the review, with John Berryman,
apparently another of his be^tes noires), though only
the queen of tautology has influenced me very
directly.

Theroux goes on to say that certain works of mine that
he considers "impenetrable," like theirs, are "nothing
less than irresponsible." In my case: "for a writer to
write codswallop? Jabber? . . . can become nothing
less than infuriating, I would even assert it is
morally indefensible" (italics mine).

I have probably written my share of codswallop, though
I'm not sure what it is--like slumgullion, perhaps?
Another excellent word.  And jabber, yes, I've been
guilty of that too. But my point is that Theroux's
article, while ostensibly a review of my early books,
is really about his rage at certain major 20th century
writers and about his notions of the moral
responsibility of poetry, both of which emerge there
only as the tip of the iceberg. Rather than trashing
Stein, Pound, Olsen, Zukofsky and Berryman en passant,
it would have been more enlightening for the reader if
Theroux had outlined the nature of his case against
them a little more amply, then and only then dropping
the shoe of the morality issue. ("Yam-in-the-mouth"
simply won't do as a summation of Olsen; perhaps he
has him confused with Karen Finley?) I for one would
have been interested to learn why a writer of
Theroux's stature has it in for a handful of America's
great modernist poets.

John Ashbery, New York

-------------------------------------------------------

Alexander Theroux replies:

There is not a word in my review that did not speak
directly to either Ashbery's fine poetry or various
other incomprehensible doodles of his which he has the
whim, even if I do not, to call by the same name. I am
unaware of shooting at any betes noires in my review
of his books other than those who practice the
crapulous and farcically self-defeating act of
offering bad or half-made work under the guise of
serious poetry to be pondered, when it remains in fact
impossible to be understood. It is apparently for my
presumption in condemning such bumph that Ashbery
accuses me of "rage" and of having some sort of
interest to declare. "Great modernist poets," he
implies, should be above such criticism, although how
the writer of the following lines from "Idaho"

"Carol!" he said. Can this be the one time

????????????????????????????????????????

Biff: The last Rhode island reds are

"diet of hamburgers and orange juice"

I see into the fields of timothy

one

the others time

change

, , , , , , , and they walked back,

small hand-assemblies"

can presume to call upon anyone to clarify or outline
the nature of anything is beyond me. I only ask the
reader to take Ashbery's own measurement by that for
which he blames me and to which, in his letter, he
takes exception.

Willful obfuscation in a writer is completely
indefensible simply because, like jealousy, it mocks
the meat it feeds on. It is the ugly matching bookend
of that other moronism, the greeting card verse of
simple-minded hacks. I have no more truck with the
doggerel of Rod McKuen, Maya Angelou, etc., than I do
with Charles Olsen, who was incapable of writing a
lucid sentence, or Gertrude Stein, who flunked her
English literature courses at Harvard.

Obscurantism is morally wrong precisely for the lie it
tells in the pretense of coming forward with the
truths it simultaneously-and always
posturingly--refuses to divulge. Alexander Pope in
"The Dunciad" only inadvertently made oblique
references to contemporaries we today would never
know, had not scholars filled the void by research.
Henry James' "The Bench of Desolation" has always been
a hard nut for me to crack, much as I admire the man
and, in that and certain other stories of his, I find
myself impatiently rattling the book. I remain
bewildered by passages of Meredith's "The Egoist" and
chapters of Doughty's "Travels in Arabia Deserta" and
far too many poems in Pound's "Cantos."

Is it a perfect world? It is not. And poets are among
its bravest inhabitants. While I believe a good bit of
incomprehensibility in a poet is often the result of
attempted flight rather than of sheer ineptitude, a
good deal of it is caused by the vice of intellectual
snobbery and the assumption that whatever one writes
is good, what Robertson Davies once referred to as the
"shame of brains."

It is clear that Ashbery, who accepts my compliments
but refuses my cavils, is the one who betrays his art
by abusing it and not I, who criticizes him for it.
Asking for integrity in a poet's work is "trashing"
him? How can a poet of such byzantine contrivances
miss my homely truth? Who should know better than he
the moral and aesthetic bankruptcy of calling
gibberish "poetry" or nonsense "modernist"? We have
evidence he is able to write a simple line. What kind
of modernist mind do we need to understand "Once I let
a guy blow me. . . ." as he writes in "Poem in Three
Parts" or, "Was there a note of panic in the late
August air/because the old man had peed in his pants
again?" as he pointedly asks in "As You Come From the
Holy Land"?

Only a fool would try to insist that poetry be easy to
write or easy to read. No one who treasures such poets
as Gerard Manley Hopkins, W.B. Yeats and Wallace
Stevens, as I do, can possibly fail to acknowledge the
unavoidable fact that difficulty increases with
candlepower and vision. An incoherent poem is,
nevertheless, no more tolerable than a drunkard's
rant, except that it is more disgraceful. Ashbery
himself would seem to confess to what Yeats called the
"fascination of what's difficult" when, speaking of
handling vision, he writes in "Paradoxes and
Oxymorons" from "Shadow Train," "before you know/It
gets lost in the steam and chatter of typewriters."

I would like to answer the question that Mr. Ashbery
disingenuously asks as to why I "have it in" for
certain poets. It is the result of nothing more than
the healthy refusal to be had by them. My ambition is
not that hacks stop writing or that they stop
publishing, but for anyone to try to fob off twaddle
as poetry, without criticism, is another matter
entirely. May I request that Ashbery do me a favor in
return? Only explain for me why there are,
respectively, precisely 40 question marks and seven
commas in a row in "Idaho" and whether using,
respectively, 39 and six would have ruined the meaning
of that, um, poem.

Does anybody know of a poem (I'm told it's just dripping with bitterness)
by a poet named John Haines called HOTEL LAUNDROMAT????

If so, could you forward it me back or front channel....

"Mr. Rumsfeld got an upbeat progress report from his hand-picked choice to
lead the Pentagon's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance,
retired Lt. Gen. Jay Garner.

General Garner scolded reporters for dwelling on the shortcomings rather
than the successes of the efforts so far by troops and aid organizations to
restore civilian order and services throughout Iraq. "We ought to be beating
our chests every day," General Garner said, "and saying, `We're Americans,'
and smile.""  (New York Times, today)

Is this beyond the pale or what? The spirit of Democratic missionaries at
work - when not killing people that appear to protest? Perhaps I am
over-reacting but I find this all real spooky. Cross reference feature
movies in German occupied France. Of course, we're not Nazis. However,
imagine the citizen comfort level if fully armed Iraqis were occupying
American cities,  beating their chests, shouting and smiling, "We're
Iraqis." Nice! Or real stupid.

I am getting a refreshed sense of the oxymoron as a way of hearing the new
empire and its optimistic news.

As they say, keep heart. And fight to rebuild the language, soon.

In an exchange in the Los Angeles Times between John Ashbery and reviewer
Alexander Theroux, Theroux declares:

"I am unaware of shooting at any bêtes noires in my review of his [Ashbery’
s] books other than those [Pound, Stein, Olson, Zukofsky] who practice the
crapulous and farcically self-deprecating act of offering bad or half-made
work under the guise of serious poetry to be pondered, when it remains in
fact impossible to be understood….Obscurantism is morally wrong precisely
for the lie it tells in the pretense of coming forward with the truth it
simultaneously—and always posturingly—refuses to divulge….How can a poet of
such byzantine contrivances miss my homely truth?  Who should know better
than he the moral and aesthetic bankruptcy of calling gibberish “poetry” or
nonsense “modernist”?  We have evidence he is able to write a simple line.
What kind of modernist mind do we need to understand “Once I let a guy blow
me…”"

Quoted in Leslie Scalapino _The Public World/Syntactically Impermanence_ p.
19, though she does not give an exact cite or date of publication.

At least now you can search microfiche of the LA Times.

Good luck,

Aaron,

A pretty infamous example is by Theroux (Alexander? Paul?). I think it
appeared in The Nation, sometime in the last ten years. I do remember a
response by Ashbery--I'm almost certain it was in The Nation--in which he
said he was happy to be in the company of the other writers Theroux was
calling "obscurantist." (I think that's an accurate quotation.) I remember
Theroux railing about whether Ashbery could justify the number of
semi-colons in a line in a poem from The Tennis Court Oath. ("Europe"? Maybe
"Idaho"?) Sorry I don't have the details of publication (a quick Google
search for "ashbery" and "theroux" didn't help).

In this vein, there is a review (supposedly scathing) by Marianne Moore of
_THE NEW AMERICAN POETRY_ which I have  never looked up myself.  NY Herald
Tribune Book Review, 26 June 1960.  I think it is also supposed to be
reprinted in her collected prose.

Aaron,

I'm reading Gregory Corso's An Accidental Autobiography: Selected Letters,
just out from New Directions.  He wrote an apparently devastating critique
of the NY School in a Dutch periodical in 1957, and then immediately
regretted it, and then writes letters to O'Hara, Ashbery, etc., apologising
for it for at least ayear after.  Unfortunately the original critique is
not there, but he summarizes it by saying that they were "New Yorker" poets
-- not just New York Poets, but New Yorker Poets.  And he apparently said
that the Beats were more substantive.  He then says that O'Hara is better
than anybody in San Francisco in letters to follow.  It's a scream, but I
don't have the original.  At any rate, it appeared in Dutch, and has so far
as I know never been translated.  Big help, huh?  Mentions of it are on
72-73, and from there for about another sixty pages he mentions it on and
off (check index for Ashbery).  I think what he meant by New Yorker poet
was somewhat safe, and clean, and not about real life, by which he meant
his own school of dirty underwear strewn about the room while thinking
about beauty, I guess.

Delighted to read your article on Gurlesque.  Why don't you contact Exit Art
in NYC for a possible exhibition?

Given that the U.S. decided to pull some token troops out of Saudia =
Arabia to heal 'strained' relations between the two nations, it would =
appear that the recent conflict in Iraq does indeed have much more to do =
with safeguarding precious oil reserves than with Iraq's weapons of mass =
destruction. The precise meaning of Luca's poem is debatable, but there =
is probably more 'truth' to be found here than in the evening news. =
Andrei Codrescu commented that "...the automatic functioning of desire =
in language is Luca's great poetic discovery, and his poetry is a =
transcription of this process." Comments on this excerpt from Luca's =
poem would be interesting to me.

from LOVED FOREVER

    If there is love in general, I must above all love the one who is =
not the loved and it is in this very love that I make myself love like =
love and that the loved loves me as lover of love that I love as loved.=20

    By which, you must not take It that loves loves the loved but, on =
the contrary, that it is the loved who loves whom one loves all while =
loving oneself as love of a loved and that this loved loves by herself =
as the same loved and as this very loved.=20

    A love who would have to love the loved without being the very loved =
would be whom one does not love. The very loved would be whom one does =
not love.=20

    The loved=20

    whom I love has to love whom she loves; that is, whom she will love. =


    Thus, in loving the lover or love, my beloved loves love in her =
lover, as far as she is herself the loved of the nonlover who loves.=20

    For the non-loved to be able to not be love and for her to be able =
to love the lover of non-love without the loved being the non-loved of =
love, it is necessary that she have to love herself the not-being-loved, =
it is necessary that she have to not love the non-lover of her love.

    And this very love who is the lover of the loved makes there be an =
attracted non-lover.

    This signifies not that my beloved loves whom she loves, but simply =
that she loves to love not loved love but loving love, attracting love, =
lovingly attracted by her lovingly loved lover.

    And it goes with this that for the attracted-attracting lover, =
to-love-the-one-not-the-loved is entirely attracted by the non-loved, =
the lover loving she who is not the attracting loved in the attracted =
mode of the loved non-loved, the not-to-love-the-non-loved is never =
loved but lovingly non-loved in an attracting love, love cannot be loved =
but as it is love of the loved even as only loving the adored non-loved.

    Thus, the loved loves what I love; that is, oneself, the adored.

    Only this loved must love a loved, who loves herself and who is =
attracted by her love to be loved by herself. When, in effect, the loved =
loves herself as not loving whom! love, she already loves whom she does =
not love, she loves the adored non-loved.

    It=92s that, from the time of the attraction of the loved, the lover =
did not love only the loved but also the ardent non-loved.=20

    She whom I make myself non-love, I do only insofar as I do not love =
what she does not love what I love to rip open, but I make myself =
precisely not love a non-loved who makes herself not love what I have to =
love, that is, what I have to rip open in the ardent soul of its love.

    Only this double attraction of my beloved is what I love not to not =
love: or I make myself not love the loved and then the loved is love for =
me and I love and I love my love for her; in this case the loved ceases =
to be love for me; or the love does love my love for her and makes =
herself only be loved by my non-love for her but in this case I become =
love for me and she does not love her love beyond my love for her.

    Love is itself this non-love which I love.

    On the side of the love of the loved, the loved Is loved as the =
adored non-loved who loves me, the walls of her belly for ripping open =
axe walled in the center; on the side of the loved of love, the adored =
non-loved is loved like loved loved, for each love that I have to love =
is adored forever.

    However, this love fanned in its center which is my love to adore is =
not an opening in the wall but opening without wall.

    For this does not concern opening what is not open but rendering =
opening that which is only open; it concerns opening the open, rendering =
loving-attracting the loved to love and of fanning not the center of a =
belly but the hundred fanned winds beyond the ripping open walls.

    And it is from these winds fanned by the ripped-open non-belly of my =
beloved that the artificial golden age makes its attractions fabricated =
In the attracting-fabricating center of the love to love.

    As a matter of fact, the fabricated-fabricating attraction of the =
love to love was already there, but walled in the murmurs of the =
already-there.

    This is why the already-loved is no longer the already loved-there.

    But this always-loved, as love of my love, I love beyond the =
loved-there loves it inasmuch as she is anywhere; that is, as =
loved-everywhere-murmuring.

    As such she is and is not everywhere: soul-hole, belly whole, while =
the loved-there is not there and it is this not-there lovingly fanned =
which is the non-love of my love.

    To rip open everything is to empty the hole of her ripping open =
non-hole, not by rights of non-loved to empty=97this loved-non-loved =
would send us back to the never-loving walled forever in her belly that =
I cannot empty and in which, precisely, it is nothing to speak properly =
since she loves whom she loves=97but by rights of love to love =
everywhere and always in the hole of her soul fabricated like an adored =
and disturbing non-whole.

    Thus, it concerns the filling this adored non-whole with a hole to =
make a hole, to empty, to love, to disturb to murmur.

    But since this hole to make a hole is the loved forever and thus =
only one of the loveds, one has already said that it is in itself the =
empty to empty; for this empty to empty the empty of the loved being a =
loved, an emptied, it is properly holed just like that which has in =
itself the loved, the holed.

    In other terms, the loved is not the opposite of the loved to love =
but only the opposite of itself, the emptied; thus the loved is in =
herself the adored non-whole; or again she is not an opposite of the =
non-whole but is the hole of an empty to empty which fills the adored =
non whole like a whole.

    What remains, thus, is to replace the adored non whole with all the =
gold with air with soul with love, with all the winds fanned by love, =
with all the murmurs attracted against the walls, against the mothers, =
with all the anti-hole holes of our lovers.              --Gherasim Luca
