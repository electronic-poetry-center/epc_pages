YouTube recording of our set at Bowery Poetry Club

Today we visited ESP-Disk and found that someone had put up part of our
set on YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAre8RTwF5g
- Azure Carter singing, I'm on an Epiphone electric, no effects.
Do check this out! It's not a particularly good video but it gives an idea
of our live music, at least on guitar. (Next set is January 25, on guitar,
tenor banjo, Alpine zither.)

Troy,=0A=0AOne of the most fascinating developments of the post-modern era =
(& the era since then) is the development (evolution) of the Serial Poem. R=
obin Blaser's 'The Holy Forest' and Nate Mackey's 'Mu' or 'Song of the Ando=
umbolou' (which together could be considered part of the same poem) are two=
 stellar examples of this. These are more recent examples and 'The Maximus =
Poems' and 'Paterson' are other examples and I am sure folks on the list co=
uld chip in their own favorites.=0A=0AThe narrative that emerges is not as =
obvious and requires more study, more of a commitment than what was previou=
sly known as 'epic.'=0A=0AThe recognition of these in a mode similar to the=
 epics of the past is very much a function of this shift in literature, esp=
ecially after 1945 (the beginning of the post-modern era) and Jack Spicer's=
 notion gets close to summing it up:=0A=0A=85The trick naturally is what Du=

I don't think it's puritan moralizing to criticize prostitution; I
think it's puritan moralizing to disallow its use as a metaphor.

A few weeks ago the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis was the venue for the world premiere of the opera The Making of the Americans, which is based on the Gertrude Stein novel of the same name. It was directed by Jay Scheib, and written by Brooklyn-based composer Anthony Gatt. I have heard nothing but rave reviews of the event.

On my blog there is an extended discussion about the event with Greg Hewett, a widely published poet, opera buff, and Carleton College English professor.

I never once ever remotely indicated that prostitution shouldn't be
criticized, Ruth. I certainly do agree, separate and apart from the idea of
puritan moralizing, that prostitution should be legalized and run in a
humane manner where the health and safety of the women engaged in the
practice are one of the paramount concerns. Prostitution has been with us
forever and will continue to be with us forever. So, it certainly makes
sense to respond to this in a manner that takes this into account. Hasn't
your country learned from its experience with prohibition. The only thing
that it accomplished through criminalization is to support organized crime
and increase the need for a larger police force. Here in Canada, our
Neo-Conservative Party,  has goosestepped its way it thinking that all the
evil in the world has been unleashed by having a safe injection site in
Vancouver. Ah, the folly of modern government and society.

sick of men saying it's puritan moralizing to criticize prostitution.
whether it shd be legal or not is a complicated question. but I make no
judgment about prostitutes. if anything, I wish the world could hold them in
its arms in a loving way to counteract all they suffer.

Ruth and Amy make important points: That there may be parallels
between prostitution and football does not make it invalid to
criticize the specific institution, and specifics of the institution,
of prostitution; nor does criticizing prostitution invalidate
criticisms of football or any other form of labor; nor does the fact
that both prostitution and football are labor mean that the precise
terms of any particular critique should apply precisely in the same
way to both of them. If prostitutes and the work they do were valued
and valorized in this culture in the way that football players are, I
imagine we would be having a very different conversation about The
Poetry Brothel, but we do not value and valorize prostitutes, and
while one reason we do not may have to do with a general (generic)
squeamishness about sex and what it means to sell sex, another, more
pervasive reason, has to do with the misogyny of our culture and how
women are situated physically, politically, culturally and
socioeconomically by that misogyny--and, need I say it?, the ways in
which this misogyny and the institutions it forms and informs serve
the needs of men.

Why does the idea of the Poetry Slam not elicit critiques of the sort
that Ruth brought up about The Poetry Brothel in terms of the
commodification of men's bodies, etc. in wrestling smack downs, boxing
or other violent sports? Well, one reason is that those sports do not,
ultimately, devalue men; they may put men's bodies at great risk, but
they actually enhance the status of the men who participate in them
*as* men; prostitution also puts women's bodies at great risk, but
rather than enhance prostitutes' status *as* women, it merely cements
the status of the women who are prostitutes as second-class, dirty, or
whatever appropriate adjective you wish to apply.

This does not mean that we ought not to critique the Poetry Slam and
the sports for which it is a literary performance metaphor from a
masculine-gendered perspective, but even then the terms of the
critique will be different because men and women are positioned
differently in terms of our genders. To try to level everything off by
equating the ways in which men are violence-objects in our culture to
the ways in which women are sexual-objects, and by suggesting that the
consequences of that objectification ought also be seen as equal
(which means, essentially, interchangeable) is to deny, ignore and
therefore perpetuate the reality of male dominance in the lives of
both men and women.

I have not been to The Poetry Brothel, but it seems to me, at least
conceptually, to be brilliant satire, something along the lines of
Woody Allen's The Whores of Mensa. I do wonder about the difference
between writing this kind of satire and performing it, especially when
the performance takes place regularly and someone is making (however
little) money; but that, too, seems to me what good satire is supposed
to do: call into question where we draw our lines by crossing them in
ways that some will find offensive and others will find, well,
satirical.

This is a good point. I don't think that I'm trying to say that the
repetition itself is so bad, it's more that it's a marker of trauma,
or in Golynko's case a marker of an existential emptiness that we
can't seem to move beyond (not that moving beyond has to be a goal in
a sense of throwing out some bad thing, but maybe more in the sense of
seeing what all of our litle spores of culture are growing out of).

When we think about the (supposedly) thousand-three-hundred-eighty-two
Eskimo words for snow, and our own five-thousand-fifty-two words for
marijuana (i am totally making these numbers up) the function is so
diferent.

The marijuana words aren't trying to distinguish between anything,
they have to keep moving around so that in a quite physical sense they
won't get "caught."

(& well, of course it is not they who will get caught, but us.)

and maybe instead of running and running to would be good to do
something about that big boot that is squashing us into emptiness.

Well, now I *am* making value judgements.

It's not that I want to get god back or do away with emptiness, but
it's good to notice that it is there and how we are working through
it. Maybe the emptiness can get some names too?

I'm of the opinion that repetitious arts and rituals helped our ancestors to see the patterns in nature better, making them better at noticing the subtle changes in the rhythms of nature, making them better hunters and gatherers, and be better at not being prey to predators. Repetition also has the effect of altering brain states too, though, so the result is religious experiences, mass hypnosis, etc. When decoupled from its religious and artistic origins, we repetitious buying, etc. that forms the core of many people's critique of capitalism. It seems to me, though, that the same people who make this critique then assume that all repetition is bad (many in the Marxist camp also are anti-religion, so wish to do away with that form of repetition as well), and the baby is thrown out with the bath water -- making people in fact even more

It seems to me that the long poem became impossible with the abandonment of narrative by poets. How long can one keep up a feeling or a mood or an "experiment"? Frederick Fierstein writes quite long poems, but his poems also have narratives holding them together. Frederick Turner has written two epic poems.

There's a lot of interesting stuff here, but one does wonder how one fits
pre-capitalist societies into this. The epic poem all but dies off with the
advent of the Modern Era and capitalism. How does one fit the idea of line
production in fact being LOST with the advent of capitalist society? Homer,
Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, Virgil, et al were well-known authors, all
pre-capitalist. Certainly your points about serialization and novel product=
ion
with Balzac are quite interesting and true, but your thesis almost treats
literary production as having arisen with capitalism. How does one fit the =
rest
of world literary history into your model?

Dear Eireene--



Thank you so much for this excellent piece and the question you pose.



Seriality in writing as a deliberate form is directly an effect of
Captialsim--in that serials such as the Feuilletons of Eugene Sue and the
serial manner of publishing Dickens' novels, became one of the few ways
that an
author could make money directly from writing--and also it was used as a wa=
y to
get people to keep buying the newspaper or journal in which the serial
appeared.



Seriality of this kind is constructed round the desire to "want to know
what happens next" and is accompanied by the acceptance by the reader that
one "will pay any price  to find out how the cliff hanger was
resolved--and what happens next until the next cliff hanger is reached=97=
=93



An author often could make more money from selling a serial than having a b=
ook
appear "all at once," due to the lack of copyright for American
writers who were pirated outrageously by British publishes, and the lack of
copy right in many other countries also.



A writer like Dostoyevsky who had gambling debts would crank out serials to=
 pay
off creditors, a vast improvement actually on the strategies open to=20
Balzac,  who often wrote six books at a time, for several different
publishers, not having yet the serial at his disposal. =20



(Hence the often strange effect in many of Balzac=92s works,
that a book begun at one point in time, interrupted to complete two others =
more
pressing, then returned to=97the writer would suddenly decide that a differ=
ent
character should step into the spotlight from its previous position vaguely=
 in
the background at the edge of the wings and faded old curtains--, and in
stepping forward, suddenly alter almost entirely the direction of the narra=
tive
and the meaning of the moral Balzac was presenting as another in his
=93philosophies des moeux=94 in the structure of the Comedie Humaine



A structure whose descriptions and analyses Karl Marx found
to be the greatest and most perceptive study ever made of Capitalism in all=
 its
function and effects---



Seriality was continued in the early "Motion Pictures" with the
famous feuilletons of Louis Feuillade so beloved of the
Surrealist--"Judex" "Les Vampyrs" and etc--and in the US
the endless series of "Adventures of Pauline' and her constellations
of
spin offs--tied to the rail road tracks as the train approaches--and escapi=
ng
miraculously--only to have another misadventure seize hold of her before th=
e
reel runs out--and the lettering on the black screen says--"Wait Until
Next Week to Find Out What---"



Serial production functions not unlike a model of addiction--once hooked, o=
ne
HAS to keep coming back for MORE MORE MORE--which is at once the
"same" and slightly different, just enough so, that the sense of
being both satisfied that "the stuff is good" and at the same time
give an extra "plug" in that one enjoys it for only so long and then
has to be in the throes craving until the next fix can be obtained.



Soap operas came about for the same reason--to keep the customer coming bac=
k in
order to have the familiar fix and also to experience the titillation of th=
e
seductive "wait for next time and I'll be there--just waiting for
YOU--"



"Soap" opera referring to be sure to the selling of laundry soaps
that paid for the serial production of these "Opere"--so that both
the "serial" and the product become inseparably associated and one
finds oneself suddenly craving--soap!!=20



Actually Language Poetry's assertions about grammar being an expression of,
structured by, Captialsim, is a fallacy, in terms of linguistics, and is
instead
a kind of "soap" that sponsors the reader's having a new
"mode
of production" i.e. "a new line"--to develop an addiction
to--'what will be the next book from language writers?--what will be the
next
exciting daring thing they do in their hair raising battle with
capitalism"--in other words,  a fallacious
"anti-capitalist" production is marketed as just that--hey!! Buy us!!
We are anti-capitalism=92s structuring of grammar!! We are liberating
you!!--From
what? =96



From buying one form
of poetry one is freed to buy another.  Nothing has changed but the
"exterior appearance" of the product.  Inside it is the same old
thing--production, product, authors, canons, sub divisions of categories of
styles, rhetorical devices and =93morphemic transgressions=94 replete with
torque  and the tensile strengths of the
requisite number of  =93allowances for the
reader=92s constructions of their own meanings=94-- and  all of these cramm=
ed
within the new models so
that one might choose still somehow between a convertible or a coupe, or
perhaps
simply a two door or a four door---



And what colors would you like these to come in?--With or with out ash tray=
s,
CD player--radio?--No smoking?=97OK=97we=92ll make a note of that=97no
lighter=97either--



Oh!! Did someone mention Hybrids--??!!  How marvelous!!--What a pun, mon
vieux=97do you mean automobiles or genres--?=97or perhaps some fantastical =
life
form=97out of Lewis Carroll or Borges=97



A used car dealer, a used poem dealer . . . .or perhaps in
these days of tightened belts=97the two combined and displaying their wares=
 on
the same much contracted =93lot=94

whose fading banners
may well not be seen by the dawn=92s early light=97other than as limp remna=
nts
of
plastic  curling and scuttering across
the tarmacs in the gusts of an ill wind blowing no good=97



Yes=97from the assembly line to the poetic line=97

Is a very fine line indeed=97

And so one can replace the unemployed=92s  former jobs on the assembly line

With jobs on the poetic line=97

Hard at work creating serial production again--



The serial is created to "provoke and sustain interest through
time--"



And indeed one might think of this interest as a paying of interest in that
instead of one product in full paid for al at once, one is paying for the
product stretched out through time, and so pays more for each
"section" in the serial, bringing the total cost of the completed
series to quite a bi more than if one had simply been able to purchase the
whole thing inside one cover.  But then--one would have been deprived of
the thrill and the touch of each new issue each new episode arriving in the
stores or in the mails or on line or video--awaiting with that craving so
deliciously satisfied by the insertion into the human system of the capital=
ist
addiction system--and then, as the pleasure is moving through out one in a
sensuous erotic glow--suddenly one is cut off-and told to wait until next
time--



And there one is, "Waiting for the Man, 26 dollars in your hand/he's
never
early, always late/the first thing you learn/is you just got to wait."



And so there were and may still be--long lines queuing up on the days that =
the
"Man" is coming --shivering and shaking in the junk sick streets
until at the last moment of unendurable waiting, when al are cursing the
"Man" who is subjection them to this suffering--at this last moment
when al are ready to forever consign this Monster to the dustbins of their
crashed hopes and illusions--here he or she is!! And like salivating dogs t=
hey
al rush to lick her (or his)  feet and
rub against his (or her) legs and practically shit themselves in delight--w=
ith
outpourings of love finally getting their greedy paws on the serial's new
installment, and putting down al their hard saved coins and bills for this
immediate satisfying of the unbearable cravings building up--



How many times does one not find someone writing of having to satisfy their
poetry fix with a quick rush to a book store and their tear off their coats=
,
yank up their sleeves, wrap the nearest belt or cord around their scrawny a=
rm
and inject three or four chapbooks--and with great and sudden euphoria--plu=
nk
down whatever price they are told these precious "rocks" are jacked
up to this week--



Who hasn=92t seen lurking near the bookstores and poetry dens the sinister
figure
of the Reviewer loaded with the latest galleys and review copies of release=
s,
wiling to sell them cheaper than the store--or forego the cash as long as t=
he
figure is paid for in some kind of trade--for sex perhaps, or say season ti=
cket
to the opera or bal game or perhaps simply the inside scoop on some trading=
 tip
on good old Wall Street--or a tip on the races--



A different method of composition was advocated by Edgar Allan Poe, who, in=
 his
"Principles of Poetry" and "Philospsophy of Composition"
formulated one of the msot influential approaches to this day for the
production
of poems and , to be sure--short stories.  This is to create works whcih,
given the speeding up oflife and magazine prodcution, can be read in one
sitting, because, argues Poe, only in having the entire poem or story all a=
t
once, is one experiencing the full power of the Effect.  For Poe, --and
this is also an argument against the "Inspiration=94 of Romanticism--a
poem
is constructed deliberately, almost mathematically as well as musically--by
choosing first the effect to be experienced by the reader, and working
"backwards," determining the elements and their arrangements with in
the structure which is determined by the length of time as measured in numb=
ers
of words. =20



Where the serial exploits the drawing out of time, as a never quite consumm=
ated
series of piquing of desire--the work as advocated by Poe--delivers an Effe=
ct
so great that is far more satisfying than the long drawn-out
"sickness" of serial addiction, with its attendant ever demanding
layouts of cash--



The short story, the short poem--for Poe these offer a much more interestin=
g
field for the investigations of questions of composition--because they prov=
ide
CONSTRAINTS--which provoke rather  than limit discoveries--because
"Necessity the Motherfucker of Invention" is a goad to the
imagination completely at odds with its dispersal as in a serial--in which =
the
poet or writer has far more TIME to dream up what happens next--



Poe's theories of Composition, traced via Baudelaire and his invention of
the
short prose poem--and the theory of Correspondances--is at the basis of Fre=
nch
Symbolism as it culminates in Mallarme--a good friend of his Tuesdays atten=
dee
Felix Feneon, who, combining his anarchist ideas with those of the
"creation of the effect"--much as Mallarme noted that Feneon's
words
were "detonators" as much as the bombs he advocated and may have
thrown himself--comes up with the turning of his hack job writing "Faits
Divers" for the mass circulation Le Matin into the writing simultaneously
of news (Nouvelles) and  "short stories" (nouvelles), which
become known when published posthumously as his "Nouvelles en trois
lignes"--News Stories/Short Stories in three lines.  Like Poe, who
published his works in newspapers and large circulation journals, Feneon is
melding "news of the day=94 in its documentary "detective story"
aspect with its fictional "Balloon Hoax" (published in a newspaper to
emulate one that had been taken as truth) and "Purloined Letter,"
"Ms in a Bottle" aspects.=20



Since the short story and short poem, the "Faits Divers" hack filler
turned into a short story/documented event do not create the dependence the
"fort-da" psychology of Captilist Need and Desire, these short,
effect driven works subvert in a strange way the more "profitable"
serials in that they offer the "most bang for the buck'--as it were,
rather than endlessly teasing out the most bucks for an ever differed bang =
as
does the serial.



This "bang" effect is literally "realized, if one is willing to
think of this way--in the naming of the NFL Baltimore Ravens for Poe's
poem.
The Ravens, a hard hitting team led by a Super bowl MVP Ray Lewis who has b=
een
charged in the past with connection to a homicide--play with indeed the mos=
t
bang delivered for the buck--producing some "shocking" effects and
like Poe producing a "mystery story to be investigated by
detectives."



One of the reasons for Poe's development of his theories was not
surprisingly,
economic.  In Poe=92s time American writers had no copyright protection, so
the one surest way to "get the most out" of a piece of writing was to
have it produce its effect al at once, before it was pirated.  "The
Raven," for example, was pirated thousands of times--it was a
"Platinum Selling Hit" for its times--yet Poe was paid only once, and
that, for him, a not too miserly fee of a few dollars. was al he ever recei=
ved.



In the 1890=92s, Henry James was faced with the example of
Poe, a writer who in the past he had been dismissive of.  After the fabulou=
s
failures of his dramatic pieces
on the stage, James found himself in need of money to keep himself and his
beloved Lamb House afloat. (His neighbors there were to become Stephen Cran=
e,
Joseph Conrad and H. G. Wells.)



James decided at first one the old famialar standby=97the
writing of a serial=97which proved to be =93The Turn of the Screw.=94 As he
worked to
find a way to keep on creating an Effect on which each episode would end so=
 as
to keep the suspense hanging and make the reader desire intensely to purcha=
se
the nest episodes as they appeared=97James began reconsidering Poe=92s theo=
ry
of
the Effect.  From the creation of a ghost
story serial, James began to turn to the creation of short stories which, l=
ike
Poe=92s
are created with the final effect in mind.=20


(While dictating aloud to his red haired Scottish typist
=93The Turn of the Screw,=94 James discovered himself building in each epis=
ode
to
the proper cliff hanging effect=97only to see not =93an effect=94 produced =
on
the
typist, but rather his poker faced question as he paused with fingers in mi=
d
air to type the next words=97=93And then?=94 This may have contributed a bi=
t
towards
James=92 deciding he would prefer to produce the Effect in toto in a short
story=97just to see what if any Effect it had on the seemingly unimpression=
able
red haired typist.)



Another interesting example is Roberto Bolano, who turned
from writing poetry to producing short stories after his marriage and with =
a
child
on the way.  Bolano, like many other
writers who have used this material of the short story competition for shor=
t
stories in themselves, discovered that in Spain a great many towns and smal=
l
cities offered prizes for best short story on such and such a theme, place =
or
person of the immediate region.=20
Competing for prizes helped Bolano develop his skills at producing
Effects that would =93outshine=94 those of his opponents.



From the short stories he moved to the novella form, and he
became aware his life was rapidly getting shorter and shorter, and that the
best way to leave a profitable legacy for his family was to compose
novels=97and
ever bigger ones!=97Bolano devoted himself literally feverishly to the
production
of as man words as possible, in order to earn the most money posthumously f=
or
his widow and small son.



The connection between Captialsim and writing is NOT
grammar, but WORD COUNT=97page length=97and, hopefully for the writer and
publisher
both, NAME RECONITION=97by which a much slighter prodcution can be marketed=
 if
the author=92s name, rather than the bulk, merits the raising of the price =
no
matter how short a work may be.



In one of his essays the Italian Futurist (an ex-Symbolist
whose Futurism is littered with many of the most hackneyed of Symbolist ima=
ges
and techniques), considered that literature and poetry could be assigned va=
lues
based on a system of weights and measures, including that of measuring and
weighing =93quality=94=97which is not unrelated is it not to=94 Name
Recognition=94 as a
=93guarantee=94 of at least a certain level of quality being available to t=

This is another of the paradoxes of the hack work of
Feneon=92s Faits Divers=97that in an anonymous poorly paid and very
low-regarded
form, he would decide to go about producing work of the highest quality, wh=
ile
getting absolutely no credit for it =93in name=94 nor being rewarded for hi=
s
extra
efforts by any increase in the minimal pay.



And so it is only a century later that Feneon=92s Faits Divers
aka Nouvelles en trois lignes appear in English, in a translation of most o=
f
the pieces.  (The translation unfortunately
uses the word =93novels=92 for nouvelles=97which disappears the punning of
=93short
news items, news briefs=94 and short stories. Instead there is a making muc=

reveiewers of the pieces being =93novels=94 which contradicts the entire
meaning of
the pun. It also makes impossible the contemporary punning of =93news

There's a lot of interesting stuff here, but one does wonder how one fits
pre-capitalist societies into this. The epic poem all but dies off with the
advent of the Modern Era and capitalism. How does one fit the idea of line
production in fact being LOST with the advent of capitalist society? Homer,
Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, Virgil, et al were well-known authors, all
pre-capitalist. Certainly your points about serialization and novel product=
ion
with Balzac are quite interesting and true, but your thesis almost treats
literary production as having arisen with capitalism. How does one fit the =
rest
of world literary history into your model?

Dear Eireene--



Thank you so much for this excellent piece and the question you pose.



Seriality in writing as a deliberate form is directly an effect of
Captialsim--in that serials such as the Feuilletons of Eugene Sue and the
serial manner of publishing Dickens' novels, became one of the few ways
that an
author could make money directly from writing--and also it was used as a wa=
y to
get people to keep buying the newspaper or journal in which the serial
appeared.



Seriality of this kind is constructed round the desire to "want to know
what happens next" and is accompanied by the acceptance by the reader that
one "will pay any price  to find out how the cliff hanger was
resolved--and what happens next until the next cliff hanger is reached=97=
=93



An author often could make more money from selling a serial than having a b=
ook
appear "all at once," due to the lack of copyright for American
writers who were pirated outrageously by British publishes, and the lack of
copy right in many other countries also.



A writer like Dostoyevsky who had gambling debts would crank out serials to=
 pay
off creditors, a vast improvement actually on the strategies open to=20
Balzac,  who often wrote six books at a time, for several different
publishers, not having yet the serial at his disposal. =20



(Hence the often strange effect in many of Balzac=92s works,
that a book begun at one point in time, interrupted to complete two others =
more
pressing, then returned to=97the writer would suddenly decide that a differ=
ent
character should step into the spotlight from its previous position vaguely=
 in
the background at the edge of the wings and faded old curtains--, and in
stepping forward, suddenly alter almost entirely the direction of the narra=
tive
and the meaning of the moral Balzac was presenting as another in his
=93philosophies des moeux=94 in the structure of the Comedie Humaine



A structure whose descriptions and analyses Karl Marx found
to be the greatest and most perceptive study ever made of Capitalism in all=
 its
function and effects---



Seriality was continued in the early "Motion Pictures" with the
famous feuilletons of Louis Feuillade so beloved of the
Surrealist--"Judex" "Les Vampyrs" and etc--and in the US
the endless series of "Adventures of Pauline' and her constellations
of
spin offs--tied to the rail road tracks as the train approaches--and escapi=
ng
miraculously--only to have another misadventure seize hold of her before th=
e
reel runs out--and the lettering on the black screen says--"Wait Until
Next Week to Find Out What---"



Serial production functions not unlike a model of addiction--once hooked, o=
ne
HAS to keep coming back for MORE MORE MORE--which is at once the
"same" and slightly different, just enough so, that the sense of
being both satisfied that "the stuff is good" and at the same time
give an extra "plug" in that one enjoys it for only so long and then
has to be in the throes craving until the next fix can be obtained.



Soap operas came about for the same reason--to keep the customer coming bac=
k in
order to have the familiar fix and also to experience the titillation of th=
e
seductive "wait for next time and I'll be there--just waiting for
YOU--"



"Soap" opera referring to be sure to the selling of laundry soaps
that paid for the serial production of these "Opere"--so that both
the "serial" and the product become inseparably associated and one
finds oneself suddenly craving--soap!!=20



Actually Language Poetry's assertions about grammar being an expression of,
structured by, Captialsim, is a fallacy, in terms of linguistics, and is
instead
a kind of "soap" that sponsors the reader's having a new
"mode
of production" i.e. "a new line"--to develop an addiction
to--'what will be the next book from language writers?--what will be the
next
exciting daring thing they do in their hair raising battle with
capitalism"--in other words,  a fallacious
"anti-capitalist" production is marketed as just that--hey!! Buy us!!
We are anti-capitalism=92s structuring of grammar!! We are liberating
you!!--From
what? =96



From buying one form
of poetry one is freed to buy another.  Nothing has changed but the
"exterior appearance" of the product.  Inside it is the same old
thing--production, product, authors, canons, sub divisions of categories of
styles, rhetorical devices and =93morphemic transgressions=94 replete with
torque  and the tensile strengths of the
requisite number of  =93allowances for the
reader=92s constructions of their own meanings=94-- and  all of these cramm=
ed
within the new models so
that one might choose still somehow between a convertible or a coupe, or
perhaps
simply a two door or a four door---



And what colors would you like these to come in?--With or with out ash tray=
s,
CD player--radio?--No smoking?=97OK=97we=92ll make a note of that=97no
lighter=97either--

life

A used car dealer, a used poem dealer . . . .or perhaps in
these days of tightened belts=97the two combined and displaying their wares=
 on

may well not be seen by the dawn=92s early light=97other than as limp remna=
nts

the tarmacs in the gusts of an ill wind blowing no good=97



Yes=97from the assembly line to the poetic line=97

Is a very fine line indeed=97

And so one can replace the unemployed=92s  former jobs on the assembly line

With jobs on the poetic line=97

Hard at work creating serial production again--



The serial is created to "provoke and sustain interest through
time--"



And indeed one might think of this interest as a paying of interest in that
instead of one product in full paid for al at once, one is paying for the
product stretched out through time, and so pays more for each
"section" in the serial, bringing the total cost of the completed
series to quite a bi more than if one had simply been able to purchase the
whole thing inside one cover.  But then--one would have been deprived of
the thrill and the touch of each new issue each new episode arriving in the
stores or in the mails or on line or video--awaiting with that craving so
deliciously satisfied by the insertion into the human system of the capital=
ist
addiction system--and then, as the pleasure is moving through out one in a
sensuous erotic glow--suddenly one is cut off-and told to wait until next
time--



And there one is, "Waiting for the Man, 26 dollars in your hand/he's
never
early, always late/the first thing you learn/is you just got to wait."



And so there were and may still be--long lines queuing up on the days that =
the
"Man" is coming --shivering and shaking in the junk sick streets
until at the last moment of unendurable waiting, when al are cursing the
"Man" who is subjection them to this suffering--at this last moment
when al are ready to forever consign this Monster to the dustbins of their
crashed hopes and illusions--here he or she is!! And like salivating dogs t=
hey
al rush to lick her (or his)  feet and
rub against his (or her) legs and practically shit themselves in delight--w=
ith
outpourings of love finally getting their greedy paws on the serial's new
installment, and putting down al their hard saved coins and bills for this
immediate satisfying of the unbearable cravings building up--



How many times does one not find someone writing of having to satisfy their
poetry fix with a quick rush to a book store and their tear off their coats=
,
yank up their sleeves, wrap the nearest belt or cord around their scrawny a=
rm
and inject three or four chapbooks--and with great and sudden euphoria--plu=
nk
down whatever price they are told these precious "rocks" are jacked
up to this week--



Who hasn=92t seen lurking near the bookstores and poetry dens the sinister
figure
of the Reviewer loaded with the latest galleys and review copies of release=
s,
wiling to sell them cheaper than the store--or forego the cash as long as t=
he
figure is paid for in some kind of trade--for sex perhaps, or say season ti=
cket
to the opera or bal game or perhaps simply the inside scoop on some trading=
 tip
on good old Wall Street--or a tip on the races--



A different method of composition was advocated by Edgar Allan Poe, who, in=
 his
"Principles of Poetry" and "Philospsophy of Composition"
formulated one of the msot influential approaches to this day for the
production
of poems and , to be sure--short stories.  This is to create works whcih,
given the speeding up oflife and magazine prodcution, can be read in one
sitting, because, argues Poe, only in having the entire poem or story all a=
t
once, is one experiencing the full power of the Effect.  For Poe, --and
this is also an argument against the "Inspiration=94 of Romanticism--a
poem
is constructed deliberately, almost mathematically as well as musically--by
choosing first the effect to be experienced by the reader, and working
"backwards," determining the elements and their arrangements with in
the structure which is determined by the length of time as measured in numb=
ers
of words. =20



Where the serial exploits the drawing out of time, as a never quite consumm=
ated
series of piquing of desire--the work as advocated by Poe--delivers an Effe=
ct
so great that is far more satisfying than the long drawn-out
"sickness" of serial addiction, with its attendant ever demanding
layouts of cash--



The short story, the short poem--for Poe these offer a much more interestin=
g
field for the investigations of questions of composition--because they prov=
ide
CONSTRAINTS--which provoke rather  than limit discoveries--because
"Necessity the Motherfucker of Invention" is a goad to the
imagination completely at odds with its dispersal as in a serial--in which =
the
poet or writer has far more TIME to dream up what happens next--



Poe's theories of Composition, traced via Baudelaire and his invention of
the
short prose poem--and the theory of Correspondances--is at the basis of Fre=
nch
Symbolism as it culminates in Mallarme--a good friend of his Tuesdays atten=
dee
Felix Feneon, who, combining his anarchist ideas with those of the
"creation of the effect"--much as Mallarme noted that Feneon's
words
were "detonators" as much as the bombs he advocated and may have
thrown himself--comes up with the turning of his hack job writing "Faits
Divers" for the mass circulation Le Matin into the writing simultaneously
of news (Nouvelles) and  "short stories" (nouvelles), which
become known when published posthumously as his "Nouvelles en trois
lignes"--News Stories/Short Stories in three lines.  Like Poe, who
published his works in newspapers and large circulation journals, Feneon is
melding "news of the day=94 in its documentary "detective story"
aspect with its fictional "Balloon Hoax" (published in a newspaper to
emulate one that had been taken as truth) and "Purloined Letter,"
"Ms in a Bottle" aspects.=20



Since the short story and short poem, the "Faits Divers" hack filler
turned into a short story/documented event do not create the dependence the
"fort-da" psychology of Captilist Need and Desire, these short,
effect driven works subvert in a strange way the more "profitable"
serials in that they offer the "most bang for the buck'--as it were,
rather than endlessly teasing out the most bucks for an ever differed bang =
as
does the serial.



This "bang" effect is literally "realized, if one is willing to
think of this way--in the naming of the NFL Baltimore Ravens for Poe's
poem.
The Ravens, a hard hitting team led by a Super bowl MVP Ray Lewis who has b=
een
charged in the past with connection to a homicide--play with indeed the mos=
t
bang delivered for the buck--producing some "shocking" effects and
like Poe producing a "mystery story to be investigated by
detectives."



One of the reasons for Poe's development of his theories was not
surprisingly,
economic.  In Poe=92s time American writers had no copyright protection, so
the one surest way to "get the most out" of a piece of writing was to
have it produce its effect al at once, before it was pirated.  "The
Raven," for example, was pirated thousands of times--it was a
"Platinum Selling Hit" for its times--yet Poe was paid only once, and
that, for him, a not too miserly fee of a few dollars. was al he ever recei=
ved.



In the 1890=92s, Henry James was faced with the example of
Poe, a writer who in the past he had been dismissive of.  After the fabulou=
s
failures of his dramatic pieces
on the stage, James found himself in need of money to keep himself and his
beloved Lamb House afloat. (His neighbors there were to become Stephen Cran=
e,
Joseph Conrad and H. G. Wells.)



James decided at first one the old famialar standby=97the
writing of a serial=97which proved to be =93The Turn of the Screw.=94 As he
worked to
find a way to keep on creating an Effect on which each episode would end so=
 as
to keep the suspense hanging and make the reader desire intensely to purcha=
se
the nest episodes as they appeared=97James began reconsidering Poe=92s theo=
ry
of
the Effect.  From the creation of a ghost
story serial, James began to turn to the creation of short stories which, l=
ike
Poe=92s
are created with the final effect in mind.=20


(While dictating aloud to his red haired Scottish typist
=93The Turn of the Screw,=94 James discovered himself building in each epis=
ode
to
the proper cliff hanging effect=97only to see not =93an effect=94 produced =
on
the
typist, but rather his poker faced question as he paused with fingers in mi=
d
air to type the next words=97=93And then?=94 This may have contributed a bi=
t
towards
James=92 deciding he would prefer to produce the Effect in toto in a short
story=97just to see what if any Effect it had on the seemingly unimpression=
able
red haired typist.)



Another interesting example is Roberto Bolano, who turned
from writing poetry to producing short stories after his marriage and with =
a
child
on the way.  Bolano, like many other
writers who have used this material of the short story competition for shor=
t
stories in themselves, discovered that in Spain a great many towns and smal=
l
cities offered prizes for best short story on such and such a theme, place =
or
person of the immediate region.=20
Competing for prizes helped Bolano develop his skills at producing
Effects that would =93outshine=94 those of his opponents.



From the short stories he moved to the novella form, and he
became aware his life was rapidly getting shorter and shorter, and that the
best way to leave a profitable legacy for his family was to compose
novels=97and
ever bigger ones!=97Bolano devoted himself literally feverishly to the
production
of as man words as possible, in order to earn the most money posthumously f=
or
his widow and small son.



The connection between Captialsim and writing is NOT
grammar, but WORD COUNT=97page length=97and, hopefully for the writer and
publisher
both, NAME RECONITION=97by which a much slighter prodcution can be marketed=
 if
the author=92s name, rather than the bulk, merits the raising of the price =
no
matter how short a work may be.



In one of his essays the Italian Futurist (an ex-Symbolist
whose Futurism is littered with many of the most hackneyed of Symbolist ima=
ges
and techniques), considered that literature and poetry could be assigned va=
lues
based on a system of weights and measures, including that of measuring and
weighing =93quality=94=97which is not unrelated is it not to=94 Name
Recognition=94 as a
=93guarantee=94 of at least a certain level of quality being available to t=
he
reader.



This is another of the paradoxes of the hack work of
Feneon=92s Faits Divers=97that in an anonymous poorly paid and very
low-regarded
form, he would decide to go about producing work of the highest quality, wh=
ile
getting absolutely no credit for it =93in name=94 nor being rewarded for hi=
s
extra
efforts by any increase in the minimal pay.



And so it is only a century later that Feneon=92s Faits Divers
aka Nouvelles en trois lignes appear in English, in a translation of most o=
f
the pieces.  (The translation unfortunately
uses the word =93novels=92 for nouvelles=97which disappears the punning of
=93short
news items, news briefs=94 and short stories. Instead there is a making muc=
h by
reveiewers of the pieces being =93novels=94 which contradicts the entire
meaning of
the pun. It also makes impossible the contemporary punning of =93news
flashes=94
with today=92s =93flash fictions.=94)



Flaubert, after all, had already accomplished the turning=20

Several decades
earlier of a provincial journal=92s Faits Divers into the novel Madame Bova=
ry:=20



=93Delphine Delamare, 27, wife of a medical officer in Ry, displayed
insufficient
austerity. Worse, she ran up debts. To avoid paying them, she took poison.=
=94



But then, despite the Figure of the Dead Author which
strides so stridently about among the assertions of Authors who grow plump =
with
the fees their Name Recognition brings as they Bang the Drum Slowly=97perha=
ps
SLOWLY NOT AS A DIRGE BUT AS A VERY VERY VERY LONG DRAWN OUT SERIAL=97OR-- =
EVEN
BETTER--
A DECADE ADTER DECADE ONGOING SOAP OPERA =96



What writer of today would anonymously take on hack work of
the slightest kind FOR THE LOWEST PAY and work on creating of each item a s=
hort
story beautifully composed via the elements of structure known as syntax, w=
ord
choice and the obligatory listing of information such as who what when why
where-



And a few years later basically stop writing altogether
other than letters to friends and business associates=97for it was Feneon=
=92s
=93aspiration to silence=94=97his works were constructed to attain=97



In effect, a writer who combines Bartleby=92s =93I prefer not
to=94 with Rimbaud=92s leaving of writing for work in a business establishm=
ent.
(In
Feneon=92s case, a well- known Parisian art gallery turning his no longer b=
eing

best art critic since Baudelaire to use in selling the wares he once wrote =
of.)

I think the long poem is often more a poem in interrelated segments --
Patricia Smith's "Blood Dazzler" approaches Katrina from numerous
viewpoints including the Hurricane's. At the opposite end of the
public/personal scale, Rusty Morrison's "the true keeps calm biding
its story," is a formal experiment in the nature of the book-length
poem.

In reading these book-length poems, the individual segments provide a
way to move through aspects of language/experience.

Billy Little: October 14, 1943 - January 1, 2009

Our dear comrade and brother poet, Billy Little, slipped away from this l=
ife at=20
about 5 AM on New Years Day. It almost seems to me as if he were imitatin=
g=20
one of his idols, dada hero Tristan Tzara, who died on Christmas Day in 1=
963.=20
For several days he had been telling his friends that each day might be h=
is=20
last, but he hung on and continued to breathe one day after another for=20=

several days, until finally he lost the ability to speak and passed away.=
 Billy=20
spent his last days on his beloved Hornby Island, surrounded by his frien=
ds.=20

He had been resigned to this final result since hearing from his doctors =
last=20
January that the abdominal cancer through which he had endured several=20=

rounds of chemotherapy and surgery would finally take his life in a matte=
r of=20
months rather than years. He lived the months that were left to him with =
great=20
courage and good humour, sometimes in tears, he told me once, that he=20
should have to leave the world, the life and the people that he loved wit=
h=20
such passion and devotion. The people at his bedside near the end, his so=
n=20
Matt Little, Gordon Payne and his caregiver, Colleen Work, confirmed that=
=20
through his last hours, though he could not speak, he was clearly smiling=
.

Billy=92s son, Matt, will be inviting friends to the Hornby Island ball p=
ark on=20
Sunday, January 4. In commemoration of Billy=92s life-long devoted attach=
ment=20
to books and ideas, Matt will be handing out items from Billy=92s book co=
llection.=20

Further notice of an expanded memorial event will be posted later.

Typically, Billy left his life with a jest, a protest, leaving behind his=
 own=20
obituary:

obituary

after decades of passion, dedication to world peace and justice, powerful=
=20
frindships, recognition, being loved undeservedly by extraordinary women,=

A very interesting and relevant response, Richard. I was watching the news
yesterday and noted that a young man was killed as a result of a hockey
fight. The newscaster implied that only a limited sector of the hockey
audience was interested in watching hockey fights. My first thought was,
"Bullshit!". That's part and parcel of being a hockey player and it's never
going to change. The male stereotype is  one of power and strength, of
laughing in the face of danger. Would anyone be interested in watching
people drive cars around an oval track if not for the expectation of
accidents? Isn't that one of the reasons why tennis, which demands a damned
sight more athletic ability than football or, perhaps, hockey, not as
popular a sport? Although golf and baseball and watching grass grow are
pretty popular, aren't they?

Ruth and Amy make important points: That there may be parallels
between prostitution and football does not make it invalid to
criticize the specific institution, and specifics of the institution,
of prostitution; nor does criticizing prostitution invalidate
criticisms of football or any other form of labor; nor does the fact
that both prostitution and football are labor mean that the precise
terms of any particular critique should apply precisely in the same
way to both of them. If prostitutes and the work they do were valued
and valorized in this culture in the way that football players are, I
imagine we would be having a very different conversation about The
Poetry Brothel, but we do not value and valorize prostitutes, and
while one reason we do not may have to do with a general (generic)
squeamishness about sex and what it means to sell sex, another, more
pervasive reason, has to do with the misogyny of our culture and how
women are situated physically, politically, culturally and
socioeconomically by that misogyny--and, need I say it?, the ways in
which this misogyny and the institutions it forms and informs serve
the needs of men.

Why does the idea of the Poetry Slam not elicit critiques of the sort
that Ruth brought up about The Poetry Brothel in terms of the
commodification of men's bodies, etc. in wrestling smack downs, boxing
or other violent sports? Well, one reason is that those sports do not,
ultimately, devalue men; they may put men's bodies at great risk, but
they actually enhance the status of the men who participate in them
*as* men; prostitution also puts women's bodies at great risk, but
rather than enhance prostitutes' status *as* women, it merely cements
the status of the women who are prostitutes as second-class, dirty, or
whatever appropriate adjective you wish to apply.

This does not mean that we ought not to critique the Poetry Slam and
the sports for which it is a literary performance metaphor from a
masculine-gendered perspective, but even then the terms of the
critique will be different because men and women are positioned
differently in terms of our genders. To try to level everything off by
equating the ways in which men are violence-objects in our culture to
the ways in which women are sexual-objects, and by suggesting that the
consequences of that objectification ought also be seen as equal
(which means, essentially, interchangeable) is to deny, ignore and
therefore perpetuate the reality of male dominance in the lives of
both men and women.

I have not been to The Poetry Brothel, but it seems to me, at least
conceptually, to be brilliant satire, something along the lines of
Woody Allen's The Whores of Mensa. I do wonder about the difference
between writing this kind of satire and performing it, especially when
the performance takes place regularly and someone is making (however
little) money; but that, too, seems to me what good satire is supposed
to do: call into question where we draw our lines by crossing them in
ways that some will find offensive and others will find, well,
satirical.

Came across Rob McLannan's brilliant review of the new Spicer collected and=

ing of the poem, is that, in the beginning, God made baseball.=0AThe poem w=
as written during the baseball season of 1965. It=92s dedicated=0Ato the gr=
eat American poet Jack Spicer, who told us how to write a=0Aserial poem and=
 who was also interested in baseball. He was a San=0AFrancisco Giants fan. =
Some of my critic friends like the poem because=0Ait=92s the first long poe=
m in sections that I published. Jack Spicer died=0Aabout halfway through th=
at summer, or two-thirds of the way through=0Athat summer, in Berkeley, at =
the age of thirty-nine, and his death=0Abegins to enter into the last part =
of the poem as part of the subject.=0AIt=92s an important poem to me becaus=
e it=92s a long poem that is not=0Acontinuous in a narrative sense =85 does=
n=92t have a set of characters,=0Adoesn=92t have a climax and all that busi=
ness. All that holds it together=0Ais the fact that what=92s being written =
about is baseball. It=92s written=0Ain nine sections, i.e., nine innings, a=
nd it deals with my childhood=0Amemories of baseball being played in Oliver=
, and big-league baseball,=0Aand baseball as a metaphor, and baseball as so=
mething cosmic. But=0Areally, the subject of the bookis poetry. It reflects=
 on itself. It=0Ahas a lot to say about how one makes poetry. So the love f=
or baseball=0Ais a disguised way of talking about a love for poetry.What=0A=
I=92ve always appreciated about Spicer=92s =93serial poems=94 is how they=
=0Aconnect through their sheer disconnect, letting the umbrella of=0Aconcep=
t/title cover everything that falls under it, connecting the=0Apoem, someti=
mes, simply because it is part of the same single piece.=0AWhen Spicer wrot=
e serially, everything fell into the poem, and the=0Atangent, as well as se=
rial repetition, became the point, as opposed to=0Aworking against the poin=
t. Talking about Spicer=92s serial poem in the=0Aintroduction, the editors =
write:=0A=0ASpicer conceived of and=0Adeveloped the =93serial poem=94: a bo=
ok-length progression of short poems=0Athat function together as a single m=
ovement. In his lectures, Spicer=0Aquoted Blaser=92s description of the ser=
ial poem as akin to being in a=0Adark house, where you throw a light on in =
a room, then turn it off, and=0Aenter the next room, where you turn on a li=
ght, and so on. This=0Amovement from room to room in an architectural struc=
ture makes sense if=0Ayou think of =93stanza=94 as coming from the Italian =
for =93small room.=94 As=0Ahis poetry moves from dark room to dark room, ea=
ch flash of=0Aillumination leaves an afterimage on the imagination, and the=

yes, i think this is an important part of it, the interrelated segments--
--little bits of incompleteness hooking up with other incomplete bits.

a garland of fragments. (not my own line)

"Blood Dazzler" sounds great. (and I just looked up a few excerpts--good to=
o)

Page duBois wote a little bit about this in "Sappho is Burning" but
maybe she thought that there was more of a person in our times to hold
all of the fragments together.

Maybe it is just bits of other series that show up in the gaps.

(but now I'm running off into theory land again).

Pound, H.D., Olsen, Duncan, okay.

it's this odd "irreal" hypercapitaism that I'm looking more at.

Is there anyone that you guys would throw in a line with say,

Mackey, Spahr, Roberson...

(will look at more of Patricia Smith)

That line makes me think more about music and modalities as being ways
of moving around.

Maybe Spahr is more like Golynko in that there are fewer--what to call
them--monsters--unidentifiable objects on the surface (tho they are
there).

Subject:      OPEN LETTER to Rick Warren's new friend Melissa Etheridge

 Dear Melissa Etheridge, it seemed like good news that you had met with
Pastor Rick Warren to confront him on his homophobic disinformation
campaign.  It makes sense that many thoughtful, open-minded people are
thinking that your meeting with Warren made for a good, productive meeting
of the minds.  Many of these same people worked VERY HARD to get Mr. Obama
elected, so the idea of him CHOOSING an openly homophobic anti-Semite
like Warren to give "the blessing" at his inauguration to set the spiritual
tone of his presidency is a very difficult thing to wrap our minds around.
Our feeling of betrayal is appropriate.

To be honest Melissa I have no idea how much experience you have with
Fundamentalist Christians, but they're called FUNDAMENTALIST for a reason.
When you say you are interested in peace I don't doubt you for a minute.
But when you say we should volunteer to be more visible it's nothing but
weird to me.  Your direct quote is, "Maybe if they get to know us, they
won't fear us."  But we queers don't grow on trees on a faraway island.
Fundamentalist Christians deal with us all the time because live in their
towns.  They gave birth to us, we are in their families, and we don't need
to visit because we're already there.  They know us and we know them, quite
well.

From my own experience and understanding with Fundamentalist Christian
relatives, there are some who will not allow me to use their towels or
toilets because I'm queer.  You wouldn't be allowed to either, no matter how
many CDs you've sold.  Never mind gay marriage, you can't take a shit!  And
these are people who LOVED me dearly when I was a boy.  I FELT their love,
and remember it well.  And I also remember how painful it was to let them
know I was queer, having grown up hearing their sadistic vitriol.  My
options were to hide or come out.  Hiding is an option only for the true
masochist, and I am not one.  A relative said to me, "You were such
a handsome boy, we had such hope for you."  In an instant I became someone
who was now ugly and without hope.

If I die tomorrow some members of my family will say, "We know where he's
headed!"  These are extremely unreasonable and uncompromising people, and
their bible backs them up one hundred percent.  I've read these passages,
I've had them read to me.  Queers are an abomination, period.  We can serve
all the soup in the world to all the homeless of the world but we're still
going to Hell.  The bible says so, period.  And Rick Warren can say Jews and
queers are going to Hell as gently as he can, but he still says it, and in
doing so he makes Jews and queers subhuman animals not worthy of God's
love.  We are refuse, and THAT is the very kind of philosophy which
encouraged Aaron McKinney to torture and murder Matthew Shepard.  THAT is
the very philosophy which permitted Roland Button to run over Erika Keels
four times with his car, and the very philosophy that made her so invisible
and inhuman that Philadelphia police wrote her death down as an
accident, which remains classified an accident to this day.  Despite the
medical examiner's report, despite witnesses, despite petitions and marching
and demonstrating on behalf of this 20-year old African American transwoman,
her murderer has never stood trial, see this:
http://www.petitiononline.com/ErikaK/

My boyfriend Earth was murdered in Tennessee.  His twin brother who still
lives in Philadelphia told me his hands were tied behind his back, he was
dowsed with gasoline and set on fire.  Over and over I asked, "HOW could
they do this!!!!?  HOW could they do this!!!!?"  But we all know how, we
know exactly how.  Whoever murdered him was able to find the necessary
apathy from a legacy of hate, a legacy of PERMISSION, handed down from
church to church, quoting verse to sanction and spur their actions.

In Adolf Hitler's Germany the clergy who used the pulpit to spread hatred of
Jews and Homosexuals were doing so to ease the troubled conscience, to act
as a link to the voice of God to ORDAIN The Holocaust.  Ask yourself how
guilty are these men who used their positions of respect and their aura of
holiness to push their trusting congregations to commit such atrocities?

Rick Warren is the author of one of the best-selling hardcover books in
publishing history.  And this is a country where he should be allowed to
express himself freely, but so should we be allowed to counter it, to let
the voice of reason break through.  Millions of people trust and absorb
Warren's message that Jews will burn in Hell, and that queers are not FIT to
be treated the same as decent heterosexual Christians.  Melissa why do you
ask US to volunteer in his church?  Why not ask these Fundamentalist
Christians to volunteer at gay community centers and the queer suicide
hotlines?  Instead of asking US to show how worthy we are, how about they be
asked to prove their worthiness for a change?  It is WRONG to grovel up to
them for acceptance, for these are the people who pushed US away in the
first place, remember?  The compromises they demand of us are too expensive
and would eat us alive.

We need to be LOUD and be LOUD NOW, not to get through to the people who
have shunned us and discarded us, but for the young queer people growing up
in these repressive, dangerous families.  We need to prevent yet more
suicides.  And it would be nice to prevent gay bashing and murders, but
that's a whole long battle which involves centuries of permission to undo.
Did you see the movie Borat?  The people being interviewed in the film were
not actors.  There's a man at a rodeo scene who says without hesitation into
the camera that "we're working on" being able to hang queers here like they
do in Borat's country.  The man openly admires hanging queers elsewhere in
the world.  Some days THE ONLY THING keeping these bloodthirsty people in
check in America is their fear of prison and the electric chair, and some
days that's all we queers have between our lives and the grave.

In "Homosexuality and Marxism," the great American poet Jack Spicer wrote:

     Homosexuality is essentially being alone.  Which is a fight against the
capitalist bosses who do not want us to be alone.  Alone we are dangerous.
     Our dissatisfaction could ruin America.  Our love could ruin the
universe if we let it.

Thank you Jack, for that!  This ruin to me is transformative, is the
Phoenix, and feels nothing less than essential for love to DEMAND its
increase.  Melissa please don't ask us to prove that we're good people,
because if we have to prove it, then how good are the people asking us to
prove it?  And frankly I'm VERY GLAD that Barak Obama won and not John
McCain and Sarah Palin, but at the same time Obama is LUCKY I didn't know he
would CHOOSE Rick Warren's blessing BEFORE election day.  You'll see me at
the inauguration, I'll be the one with the sign that says, "YOU'RE LUCKY I
CAN'T TAKE MY VOTE BACK!"

For all those who have suffered and continue to suffer, we must remember Dr.
Martin Luther King's words, "The time is always right to do what is right."

Most sincerely,
poet CAConrad

Hey there,
 <http://data-tantrum.ning.com/>
I've just started a social network at http://data-tantrum.ning.com/  So if
you're interested in "differentiated poetics" or literacy w/o borders, check
it out. Better yet, join.

Looking to discuss multi-modal input and a poetics that includes not just
words, but food, dance, video games, you name it...

Basically, any form of engineered experience or communicaion that causes an
effect.

The first discussion is basically a "fantasy curricula league" for k-12.
Could be fun...

Hope to see you there,

JR

Updated, 4:50 p.m. | About 200,000 items from the Gotham Book Mart, which
closed in 2007 after 87 years as a New York literary haven of international
stature, have been
donated<http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/article.php?id=3D1504> to
the University of Pennsylvania.

An anonymous donor purchased the store's inventory and donated it to the
university, which announced the donation on Dec. 18. The holdings =97
primarily modern and contemporary poetry and literature, but also including
works on art, architecture, jewelry, music, dance and film =97 will go to
Penn's Rare Book and Manuscript Library, which is known for its collection
of antiquarian materials from before 1850. Citing experts, The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported on Thursday that the collection was valued at several
million dollars<http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20090101_Gotham_Boo=
k_Mart_trove_bound_for_U__of_Pennsylvania.html>,
but most of the store's inventory was bought at an auction by its landlords
for $400,000 in 2007.

"We're honored to steward the collection and give it new life as an academi=
c
resource," H. Carton Rogers, vice provost and director of libraries at the
University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.

The collection includes first editions, experimental literary magazines and
books from small presses, including "outsider literature" published by Blac=
k
Sparrow Press and poetry published by St. Mark's Church, the university
said.

The collection includes "proofs, advance copies, pamphlets, photographs,
posters, reference works, catalogs, broadsides, prints and postcards," the
university said. There are books from the personal libraries of Truman
Capote<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/truman_=
capote/index.html>
 and Ana=EFs Nin<http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=3DF40815F8=
3C5D167493C4A8178AD85F438785F9>,
as well as items signed by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Robinson
Jeffers, Woody Allen, Wallace Stevens and John Updike.

The Gotham Book Mart was founded on West 45th Street in 1920 by Frances
Steloff<http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=3DFA0712FC3E590C708=
EDDAC0894D1484D81>.
It was the haunt of literary figures like Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos=
,
H. L. Mencken, Arthur Miller, John Updike, J. D. Salinger and Eugene
O'Neill. Itexhibited<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D9500E=
1DE1431F934A25757C0A9669C8B63>
the
works of the artist Edward Gorey. Its customers included George and Ira
Gershwin, Charlie Chaplin, Alexander Calder, Stephen Spender, Woody Allen,
Saul Bellow, John Guare, Katharine Hepburn and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
At various points, Allen Ginsberg, LeRoi Jones and Tennessee Williams (for =
a
day) worked as clerks there.

Under Miss Steloff, the store twice moved to larger quarters, but stayed
within a two-block area, settling in 1946 at 41 West 47th Street. Miss
Steloff sold the
Gotham<http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=3DF40E16FE3D5C147493=
C7AB178AD85F4C8685F9>
in
1967 to Andreas Brown, another book lover, but continued to live in an
apartment on the third floor, above the store, and remained as a working
consultant.

"Along with its fame and reputation, the Gotham was also a very carefully
operated book business," Herbert Mitgang wrote in an
obituary<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D950DE2DD113DF935A=
25757C0A96F948260>
 of Miss Steloff<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D9B0DE1D61=
13BF933A05751C1A961948260>,
who died in 1989 at age 101. "As the owner and the person who paid the
salaries, Miss Steloff was demanding, irascible, unwearying and unable to
understand why no one else was willing to put as many hours or as much
concentration into the store as she did."

Beloved as it was, the bookstore had many problems over the years. In 1997,
Mr. Brown agreed to pay $1.4
million<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D9F02EEDE1E39F930A2=
5756C0A961958260>
to
Joanne Carson, who had turned over $640,000 in savings to him in 1988 and
1991 to help him buy and repair the brownstone that houses the store. In
1995, she decided she wanted her loan back with interest, and filed
suit<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D9907E1DB1130F934A3575=
6C0A961958260>
against
him.

Fineberg for The New York Times)

Mr. Brown said he would pay the money back in 2000, after selling the
building. But the sale did not occur until 2003, when Mr. Brown sold the
building<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D9504E0DA163FF931A=
15754C0A9659C8B63>,
a town house in the heart of the diamond district, for $7.2 million. In
2004, the store moved <http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/books/04goth.html>=
 to
the former H. P. Kraus antiquarian bookstore, at 16 East 46th
Street<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D9A0CE4DA173CF937A35=
75BC0A9629C8B63>,
which had closed in 2003.

It later emerged that two benefactors who had wished to remain
anonymous =97 Leonard
A. Lauder<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/leon=
ard_a_lauder/index.html>,
the cosmetics heir, who has an interest in antique postcards, and Edmondo
Schwartz, a real estate developer =97 had purchased the East Side building =
for
$5.2 million and leased it to Mr. Brown to save the Gotham. But by 2006, he
had fallen behind<http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=3D9D00EEDB=
1031F93AA2575AC0A9609C8B63>
on
his $51,000 monthly rent and owed at least $500,000 in rent, taxes, interes=
t
and other fees, and the landlords moved to evict him. The store was on its
last legs.

In May 2007, many of Gotham's possessions =97 including books signed by Mr.
Updike, letters from D. H. Lawrence, and Andy Warhol's wig rack =97 were so=
ld
at auction <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/nyregion/23gotham.html> to th=
e
landlords, who bid $400,000. The store's workers had never finished
unpacking the books from the 2004 move.

The university said that it knew the identity of the donor but that the
donor had insisted on anonymity.

Mr. Lauder, former chairman of the Est=E9e Lauder Companies, graduated from
Penn in 1954 and is an emeritus member of its board of trustees. Jonathan J=
.
Faust, a lawyer for Mr. Lauder, declined to comment on Mr. Lauder's
involvement with Gotham Book Mart.

ps. I should note, though, that at last hear Nate Mackey does consider
himself in line with Duncan, or at least has learned much from him. He
also teaches a class on H.D. So it's me, making a break, if such is
warranted.

(now it feels like a legal disclaimer) but I'm not interested in the
schools so much as something more like an idea or technique that would
help us to think about this seriality thing. and incompletes if that
is a part of where it goes.

The most popular sport on Earth, soccer/football, rarely involves fighting.
The stadiums sometimes seat 150,000, such as in Rio, and the players are
paid  ten times what hockey players receive. Baseball, also, is more
popular, at least in Japan and the United States. The stadiums seat 80,000
and the players are paid ten times what hockey players receive. And, again,
fighting is not typical in baseball, and this is true of most other
high-profile sports.

Hockey, in the USA, is veiwed as a goon show, one step up from all star
wrestling. Whereas, in Canada, your point of view is common, John. That pro
hockey allows fighting is a business decision. Whether they do or don't
permit fighting won't change the general level of popularity of hockey in
the USA. It is not going to be as popular as baseball, football, or
basketball in the USA regardless of whether fighting is permitted. It's not
their game. But, with fighting permitted, the owners do better financially
than they would otherwise.

One of these days a lawyer is going to successfully prosecute a case which
arises out of on-ice violence. To the tune of millions of dollars in damages
against an NHL club and its personnel. Only then will the business men
rethink their business decision.

In the meantime, the code lends not only hockey but Canadian society an
annoying, slightly retarded thugishness.

I was sorry to hear of the death of Don Sanderson from a hockey fight.
Unfortunately he won't be the last.

I have been watching the world junior tournament. It's been very
hard-hitting, tough, fast, exciting hockey--more exciting, I would say, than
NHL hockey--and there is hardly any fighting. I don't miss it a bit. In fact
the last few games in that tournament I've watched (Canada-Russia,
Canada-USA, USA-Slovakia, Slovakia-Sweden) have been some of the most
thrilling hockey games I've ever seen. And just about entirely without
fisticuffs.

Putting aside the dubiousness of the term post modern and the assignment of
dates to it, Pound was writing the serial poem that was the acknowledged mo=

Robin Blaser's 'The Holy Forest' and Nate Mackey's 'Mu'

the same poem) are two stellar examples of this. These are more recent exam=

we've become obsessed with it precisely because it's fallen out of
favor. Somebody, or a few people, wondered where it went, and began writing
about it. It seems to me that the long poem became impossible with the
abandonment of narrative by poets. How long can one keep up a feeling or a =
mood
or an "experiment"? Frederick Fierstein writes quite long poems, but
his poems also have narratives holding them together. Frederick Turner has
written two epic poems. It seems that the gradual abandonment of narrative =

poetry by the Modernists, especially the late Modernists, and the postmoder=

I completely agree with you. Which doesn't change my opinion any that
professional sports and prostitution have certain commonalities.

Subject: hockey violence (was poetry brothel)

The most popular sport on Earth, soccer/football, rarely involves fighting.
The stadiums sometimes seat 150,000, such as in Rio, and the players are
paid  ten times what hockey players receive. Baseball, also, is more
popular, at least in Japan and the United States. The stadiums seat 80,000
and the players are paid ten times what hockey players receive. And, again,
fighting is not typical in baseball, and this is true of most other
high-profile sports.

Hockey, in the USA, is veiwed as a goon show, one step up from all star
wrestling. Whereas, in Canada, your point of view is common, John. That pro
hockey allows fighting is a business decision. Whether they do or don't
permit fighting won't change the general level of popularity of hockey in
the USA. It is not going to be as popular as baseball, football, or
basketball in the USA regardless of whether fighting is permitted. It's not
their game. But, with fighting permitted, the owners do better financially
than they would otherwise.

One of these days a lawyer is going to successfully prosecute a case which
arises out of on-ice violence. To the tune of millions of dollars in damages

against an NHL club and its personnel. Only then will the business men
rethink their business decision.

In the meantime, the code lends not only hockey but Canadian society an
annoying, slightly retarded thugishness.

I was sorry to hear of the death of Don Sanderson from a hockey fight.
Unfortunately he won't be the last.

I have been watching the world junior tournament. It's been very
hard-hitting, tough, fast, exciting hockey--more exciting, I would say, than

NHL hockey--and there is hardly any fighting. I don't miss it a bit. In fact

the last few games in that tournament I've watched (Canada-Russia,
Canada-USA, USA-Slovakia, Slovakia-Sweden) have been some of the most
thrilling hockey games I've ever seen. And just about entirely without
fisticuffs.

Oh my God, we did not just go there in the derailment of brothel metaphors
into sports, did we? Because some of the least thuggish athletes I've met
were people I got to know while working at the DC headquarters of Special
Olympics International.

I mean, people on this thread are very politely avoiding saying "That's so
gay" in part because they know that there are gay people on this list and
that CA Conrad, among others, would stomp a mudhole of rhetoric in the
rhetorical ass of the first person to do so. But because we're all hip hip
hip hip hip and intellectual, we just absolutely know that nobody is going
to object to the casual slinging of the term "retarded" for people who may
or may not in fact have mental retardation, right? How edgy, sir. How
totally edgy.

I'm looking for writers coming through Chicago or willing to come to
Chicago for Series A, the reading series that I run.  I have plenty of
local writers to chose from, but I want to bring in some people from
outside the city.  Fiction or poetry.

Happy '09 from all of us at the Kelly Writers House in Philadelphia.
With the new year we launch another new project. Call the phone number
above any day, at any time, and hear

1) what's happening tonight or very soon at the Writers House
2) highlights of upcoming events
3) a featured poem read at the Writers House, from our archives
4) a featured recording of Writers House-affiliated students

We urge all friends of the Writers House to add this number - which we
call "6-POEM" - to their contacts list, speed dial, and address book.

"What's happening" will be updated almost every day. The other
features will be updated frequently.

Once again, best wishes for the new year,

The long poems by Pound and Olson were planned,
based on study of history, and in Olson's case, archaeology,
for God's sake!

Gwyn,

Would you prefer that Jim had said "slightly slow-witted (or simple-minded)
thuggishness"? Roget doesn't list those alternatives to "retarded" as
"offensive."
However, Jim seemed to want to express the offensiveness (to him) of a part
of Canadian society. If he wanted to call someone a bastard, would you chide
him for not saying "child of unmarried parents"? Would "dung cranium" sting
as aptly as "shithead"? Should we scruple as much in our poetry as in email
to make sure not to offend ANYone? Jim referred to an aspect of society--
not to a specific individual. I'd agree that to call a person of low
intelligence
"retarded" might offend some people (including the person so designated),
but it seems to me perfectly OK to call people retarded who clearly do
not have low intelligence but whose opinions or behavior suggest that they
have abandoned their customary average (or high) intelligence regarding a
specific situation. If they deserve opprobrium, let them have it! George W.
Bush, for example, richly deserves that epithet, even though the Internet
tells me he has an IQ of 125 ("Are you smarter than a 5th grader?" &c.).

Could we talk about poetry now?

I saw reference in there to men and gigolos.  I have a problem with the old
school "sex degrades women" feminist argument.  Is a the location of a
brothel and the profession of prostitution *always* and inherently degrading
to women?  I thought there were sex-positive feminists who were working
against that idea.

this seems pretty light hearted.
I'm sorry to hear about the wicked (objects, et cetera) capitalist.

New York poetry brothel tempts with verse

Published: Friday December 19, 2008

http://rawstory.com/news/afp/New_York_poetry_brothel_tempts_with_12192008.ht
ml

The prostitute whispers, wets her lips and prepares to bare... her heart
with a
poem.

Welcome to New York's Poetry Brothel, where punters delve between the
lines, not the sheets.

At a weekend session in a Manhattan night club called the Zipper Factory the
look was bona fide bordello.

Literary ladies of the night flitted between intimate, candle-lit nooks, red
lights and paintings of nudes.

Some of the poetesses for sale sported retro-style garter belts and frilly
knickers. One swanned about in a top hat and feather boa.

But transactions at the Poetry Brothel are of the mind, not the body, and a
moment with the catalogue, replete with pictures and whimsical descriptions,
reveals what's on offer.

Page four boasts The Professor, swearing to have heard "the wail of your
striving heart drifting over the spires of skyscrapers."

Harriett Van Os on page 10 promises to "tell you secrets she doesn't
know she knows." Cecille Ballroom tempts punters on page 13 claiming she
can "coax your drum."

Gigolo poets are available, not least Poetry Brothel co-founder Nicholas
Adamski, who goes by the name Tennessee Pink and tops tempestuous, dark
looks
with an eye patch.

"Poetry is what I love more than anything," cooed The Madame, the
sultry spirit behind the whole idea.

The Madame -- real name Stephanie Berger -- came dressed for the part in
low-cut dress, elbow-length black gloves and a peacock headdress.

"I'd rather be in the bedroom hearing poetry than listening to some
old man sitting on a chair on a stage," she explained by the light of a
guttering candle.

One-on-one encounters, for which "clients" pay three to five dollars
in addition to a 15 dollar entry fee and one free reading, took place
upstairs.

The "whores" read from their own material, much of which is free
verse, making for intense, sometimes baffling performances.

But for those needing a break, the Poetry Brothel laid on flamenco
guitarists,
a fortune-teller, a blackjack table and a bar specializing in port and
whisky

The young hedonists, most of them students, appear to have struck a
surprisingly successful formula.

"There just aren't that many poetry readings where poets show a lot of
cleavage," said The Professor, otherwise known as Jennifer Michael Hecht,
aged 43 and a real life professor at Manhattan's New School.

She teaches writing to many of the Brothel's regulars and is proud of the
result.

"It's kind of like the Weimar Republic without the Nazis. At two in
the morning you have 20- or 30-year-olds lying all over the place reading
poetry," she said.

"The custom is to read poetry alone, but we know that from Homer onward,
people read it aloud and in groups."

By midnight the Zipper Factory was packed and getting fuller -- and rowdier.

The fortune teller, bedecked in red scarf and blue plumes, mumbled to
someone
about "choppy waters." The flamenco duo strummed. The Madame, yet
another glass of port in hand, introduced poet "whores" in a voice
suggesting she appreciated more than their literary charms.

When Patricia Smith, a well-established poet, took the mike to declaim a
long
and rhythmical poem about love and making love, there were rock concert
cheers
from the crowd.

"I always shudder when I pray," Smith intoned in a mesmerizing voice,
"so your name must be a prayer."

Even for these bohemians there's no escaping the economic crisis sweeping
the country.

One of the poets, 22-year-old Nina Cheng, was about to start a job at Bear
Stearns this year when the bank collapsed. Now she is writing a play about
the
experience and applying for a playwright's course at Yale.

"I'd thought I'd do banking and get into the arts when I retired
-- not this early," said Cheng, known at the Brothel as The Opium Eater.

Another poetry prostitute, 27-year-old Rachel Herman-Gross, aka Simone,
worried
that crashing stock markets will pull the rug from under the arts scene.
"It's going to be a lot harder. A lot of artists are sustained by
grants from people with money."

But one enthusiastic "client" said the ingenuity of the Poetry
Brothel proves there are ways to survive.

"Money's always been scarce for artists and they're very
resourceful people," said Edmund Voyer, 54, a hefty man described as an
"evangelist" on his business card and who came to the Zipper Factory
wearing a kilt.

His drinking companion, Jennifer Hoa, 27, agreed money and art would always
find ways to meet.

"I've been a sell-out for years as a corporate lawyer, but I come
here," she said. "I can't suppress my artistic side."

The Madame promised that the Poetry Brothel welcomed all.

"Many are young men with perhaps a secret interest in poems," she
murmured. "Just look at the menu. Get a recommendation. Or say you
don't care. Say: 'I need poetry. I'm hungry.'"

I'm hopelessly behind on reading the digests, so I hope this isn't so late
as to be irrelevant completely.

I disagree that it's about white noise.  But I do think can be about sound
and noise to a degree and also about effect.  Much of what I've read on here
about experimentalism in poetry is about the experiment itself but rarely
about what we hope to accomplish when we experiment, what our relationship
is to the reader or listener.  I personally believe this comes from what I
think of as a confessionalist ethos, the idea that poetry is about the
self-expression of the poet, whether it's the expression of the poet's
experimental inquiries or the poet's subjectivity and feelings.

For me the point of work that you might categorize as "white noise" and
subverting the meaning of words is to scramble and reorganize the way we
process language.  My belief is that in a world in which language is
constantly misused and used against us--in a world that is virtually
composed of Orwellian newspeak, in which we are assaulted by the specious
"logic" of advertising and political language, the insidious ways that our
deepest beliefs and values are perverted, that rewiring the way we process
language is vital and poetry is the one art form that is poised to do so
because of the way in which language can be used to create surrealistic
images, unusual sound associations, and help all of us who hear and read the
work to develop our ability for creative response to the world around us.
There are so many literary forms well-suited to didacticism and even to
descriptive work, but few that have the freedom to experiment with and
explode and reconfigure language the way poetry does.

While I respect the deep feeling and intellectual fervor of the spirit of
such a debate,
the issue is one of cultural semantics. Biologically, the probability
gradient such a debate
represents in terms of the physical combinatorics of essence in one versus
the other,
ie the quality of difference in substance, would seem to render either both
equally
interesting. What is interesting to me is to develope practices, which,
though seeming
externally to be 'experimental' or 'avant-garde' are actually post-semantic
emblematicisms
harking much closer to a kind of hermetic hieroglyphics as represented by a
system like
Gerhard Dorn's in his

ON THE MONARCHY OF
THE TERNARY IN UNITY,
VERSUS THE SINGLE COMBAT
OF THE DYAD CONFUSED IN
THE MULTITUDE,

which iconistically echoes
the semiotic mantic (manic tic) of our singularly self-involved world and
collective cultus.

I am of the same local phenomenon as the mimi virus.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimivirus

I own a can of "Blow Off Duster" for removing tiny dust particles, of which
some are probably
my own sloughed off microparticles, namelessly rejoining the great flotsam
of the grating work.
I don't call it the great work, because it is tiny, Horton hears a hoo tiny,
but grate, because a grate is
like a grille, or a gryllus, an oddly elegant little monster built willy
nilly from various parts
to represent the thing it thought it needed to represent at the time. Also
grating can be annoying.

88 CONSTELLATIONS FOR WITTGENSTEIN (TO BE PLAYED WITH THE LEFT HAND)
http://88constellations.net
DAVID CLARK

"Lyrical and philosophical, this sprawling feature-length interactive film
for the internet contemplates the life and work of the influential Austrian
philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein through 88 interactive Flash animations,
each one corresponding to a constellation from the night sky. The viewer is
invited to navigate through a web of interconnecting narratives that move
from association to association - bringing Wittgenstein's work into
conversation with our contemporary digital culture. The work is an
interactive collage. It is story of a man's life told in fragments. It is a
map of coincidence and correspondences. It is a digital film. It is
story-telling as browsing.

David Clark is known for his website 'A is for Apple' that has been shown at
over 50 film festivals around the world including Sundance, SIGGRAPH,
Transmediale in Berlin and the American Museum of the Moving Image. 'A is
for Apple' won 'Best in Show' at the 2003 SXSW Interactive Festival in
Austen, Texas and First Prize at FILE2002 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He is a
member of the new media collective 'computer.says.no'. He studied at the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Program in New York, and
the Canadian Film Centre in Toronto. He currently teaches film and media
arts at NSCAD University in Halifax. His personal website is

yes I think prostitution does-- oh, boy, or oh, girl, now I'm going to get
blasted & don't have time to respond to much right now!

but I believe this because anything that objectifies human beings keeps them
from being seen a fully human, and using another person's body & paying for
it in a male-dominated culture is inherently wrong, I believe. There are
some feminists working against this idea but others like me who will
continue to object. I just saw Milk, and the sex in it was so wild & so
sweet--wish hetero sex could be like that but in our culture so far it
usually isn't.

How wd you like to be in a place where anyone cd come in & you wd have to
have sex with that person no matter how odious & that person was coming to
you to act out fantasies that cd be harmful & you had to pretend to like it
& do this over & over every day?

I guess I must be 200 years old--does nobody else agree that it's common
sense that prostitution is essentially different from other kinds of 'work'?

I was responding to the specific posting which is, itself, a lot of white noise. But it sounds like you and I are really not all that far off as to what it is that poetry is and can do. Whether "experimental" or not, one of the primary roles of all the arts is to act as a blaze on the edge of the known and the unknown, breaking new paths. It can sometimes do this, as you suggest, by going back to original meanings -- poetry can and should release us from the stranglehold of political correctness, whether that PC comes from the Left, the Right, or anyone else. It's not so much an issue of "subverting" the meaning of words as opening words up to new (or interesting old) meanings. Poetry is thus expansive. It seems to me that all too often subversion for the sake of subversion is as restrictive as what is being subverted.

In the end, poetry has to communicate something for it to have any effectiveness at all. To pick up on my metaphor of blazing a trail, if a poem deals only with what is known, is in known territory, it's really not needed. You don't need a blaze in home territory. But if you are outside of known territory, you are lost. I think too much so-called experimental poetry is outside of known territory. A blaze, to be effective, is right on the edge of the known and the unknown. It creates a new space where once can investigate and claim as home territory without being lost. All great poetry is a blaze.

Subject: FW: language v. experimental

I'm hopelessly behind on reading the digests, so I hope this isn't so late
as to be irrelevant completely.

I disagree that it's about white noise.  But I do think can be about sound
and noise to a degree and also about effect.  Much of what I've read on here
about experimentalism in poetry is about the experiment itself but rarely
about what we hope to accomplish when we experiment, what our relationship
is to the reader or listener.  I personally believe this comes from what I
think of as a confessionalist ethos, the idea that poetry is about the
self-expression of the poet, whether it's the expression of the poet's
experimental inquiries or the poet's subjectivity and feelings.

For me the point of work that you might categorize as "white noise" and
subverting the meaning of words is to scramble and reorganize the way we
process language.  My belief is that in a world in which language is
constantly misused and used against us--in a world that is virtually
composed of Orwellian newspeak, in which we are assaulted by the specious
"logic" of advertising and political language, the insidious ways that our
deepest beliefs and values are perverted, that rewiring the way we process
language is vital and poetry is the one art form that is poised to do so
because of the way in which language can be used to create surrealistic
images, unusual sound associations, and help all of us who hear and read the
work to develop our ability for creative response to the world around us.
There are so many literary forms well-suited to didacticism and even to
descriptive work, but few that have the freedom to experiment with and
explode and reconfigure language the way poetry does.

While I respect the deep feeling and intellectual fervor of the spirit of
such a debate,
the issue is one of cultural semantics. Biologically, the probability
gradient such a debate
represents in terms of the physical combinatorics of essence in one versus
the other,
ie the quality of difference in substance, would seem to render either both
equally
interesting. What is interesting to me is to develope practices, which,
though seeming
externally to be 'experimental' or 'avant-garde' are actually post-semantic
emblematicisms
harking much closer to a kind of hermetic hieroglyphics as represented by a
system like
Gerhard Dorn's in his

THE TERNARY IN UNITY,

OF THE DYAD CONFUSED IN

which iconistically echoes
the semiotic mantic (manic tic) of our singularly self-involved world and
collective cultus.

I am of the same local phenomenon as the mimi virus.

I own a can of "Blow Off Duster" for removing tiny dust particles, of which
some are probably
my own sloughed off microparticles, namelessly rejoining the great flotsam
of the grating work.
I don't call it the great work, because it is tiny, Horton hears a hoo tiny,
but grate, because a grate is
like a grille, or a gryllus, an oddly elegant little monster built willy
nilly from various parts
to represent the thing it thought it needed to represent at the time. Also
grating can be annoying.

yes & almost all prostitutes--something like 90%--in the US--have been
sexually abused as children, & it's the only way they know to get 'love.'

I think we need to make a distinction between prostitution and the
fantasy of prostitution. Most prostitution is compelled or a response
to desperation. Most fantasy prostitution, playing dress-up and the
like, isn't.

with Marilyn Monroe at the Chelsea; Bob Dylan stayed there and composed=20=

several songs (there was a failed attempt to renovate his room recently).=
 A=20
friend of mine Philip Segal, a professor of English in NYC, told me over =
dinner=20
during my stay at that the Hotel, that he attended several parties at the=
=20
Chelsea. The rooms were so small and cramped that the parties spilled out=
 into=20
the generous halls that were and still are peppered with artwork of all s=
tripes.=20
He told me that the space in the hallways is so spacious that a ballet co=
mpany=20
practiced there regularly.



The Chelsea has a reputation of being a literary and artistic flophouse o=
f sorts.=20
A place where the famous, not so famous, the shut-in, the dreamer and the=
=20
drifter coexisted. And since I was making a trek to New York to meet with=
=20
some fellow poets, I decided to book a room for a few nights.



The Chelsea, a twelve story builiding with brick and wrought iron balcony=
=20
balustrades, was the first building in NYC to be listed as a cultural pre=
servation=20
site and historic building of note. It opened in 1884 as one of the first=
 private=20
apartment cooperatives. Since 1946, the motel had been managed by the Bar=
d=20
family, and since 1955 Stanley Bard ran the joint, until he was ousted by=
 a=20
management company in 2007. Bard was a much loved manager, presiding=20
benevolently over the residents and the guests who lived there. Bard seem=
ed=20
to understand the concept of the starving artist, allowing some to pay re=
nt by=20
paintings, etc=85 However the new management is much more bottom line, an=
d=20
since Bard left there has been controversy, as residents have mounted a=20=

campaign of banners, pranks, and protests toward getting Bard back. Ed=20=

Hamilton a resident and author of =93Legends of the Chelsea Hotel=85=94 t=
old me=20
that =93Unfortunately, the hotel is no longer accepting permanent residen=
ts and=20
that is a shame. The permanent tenants are as important to the hotel as t=
he=20
tourists.=94



Upon arriving at the Chelsea my wife and I noticed a guitar store adjacen=
t to=20
the hotel was having a =93Bernie Madoff Clearance Sale.=94 Now the lobby =
ain=92t=20
your typical Holiday Inn affair. When we entered we saw a man staring=20
intensely at us, looking for all the world like the resurrection of Samue=
l=20
Beckett. He was sitting under a suspended paper mache scultpure of a fat=20=

lady on a swing. The lobby was full of artworks, murals, etc=85 There was=
 a=20
painting of an elongated, long-faced Fido, aptly named =93Chelsea Dog=94 =
that=20
captured my attention. The front desk looked like a prop from Eugene O=92=
Neill=92s=20
play =93Hughie.=94 I saw that play some years ago. It starred the actor J=
ason=20
Robards, who played a down-at-the-heels snake oil salesman, living out hi=
s=20
failed life, in a failed, gone-to seed hotel.

We took a squeaking elevator to our room on the third floor. A balding,=20=

distracted gentleman asked my wife if she knew where =93The Shining=94 pa=
inting=20
was (based on the Stephen King movie). We didn=92t now but we ran across =
it=20
later. The floor we stayed on, and in fact all the floors, are full of ar=
twork,=20
many from of the residents. Even the fire extinguishers were adorned with=
=20
stickers and graffiti, that made them look like sites of art installation=
=85I guess=20
they are. There is an eclectic selection of paintings on the walls in the=
 gothic=20
halls, including prints of Roy Cohn (of all people), Eisenhower, Jimi Hen=
dricks,=20
Hunter Thompson, a beguiling =93Horse On Oil Canvas=94 by Joe Andoe, a ph=
oto=20
montage of Andy Warhol and Muhammad Ali, and a huge mural that depicts=20=

residents in dialogue: =93Myra Resnick in 308 says the Chelsea rocks!=94 =
On the=20
top floor you experience ethereal sky light, and series of suspended mobi=
les,=20
wafting images on the ceilings.

Forty percent of the rooms are saved for residents, and there is a defini=
te=20
sense of community in the place. Ed Hamilton wrote that the Chelsea is=20=

the =93Last Outpost of Bohemia.=94 I advise you to visit and make haste/ =
the way=20
things are going /there is no time to waste!

in cambodia, india, belize, thailand, sex slaves=8Bthe slavery of the 21st c.
girls are sold sometimes from cages when they are virgins of 10 & 11. most

cure a man of it. most don=B9t make it into their 20s. they are tortured,
electric shock is used on them to keep them there. they have no hope. they
are subjected to violence daily by the men who have sex with them. they liv=

in terror.
why? bec of the low esteem in which poor girls are held in those cultures,
and for ex in india the gap btwn rich & poor & btwn genders is growing.
every year in india 250,000 to 300,000 girls are forced into prostitution.
prostitution is based upon the lack of value given to these lives.

I thought American readers, and particularly some of Billy=92s old friend=
s from=20
SUNYAB on this listserv might appreciate a little historical context on m=
y=20
earlier posting about the passing of Billy Little.=20

Billy was an early alumnus of the SUNYAB project ,one of at least four=20=

Americans related to the literary movement associated with the New Americ=
an=20
Poetry anthology who migrated to Canada in the late 1960s and early 1970s=
.=20
Robin Blaser, Stan Persky and George Stanley have each made remarkable=20=

contributions to the life of the poetry community in Vancouver, and so ha=
s=20
Billy Little. Billy was raised in New York and served his apprenticeship =
in poetry=20
at the Poetry Project in New York City. He then shuffled off to Buffalo w=
here=20
he was one of the early students in the SUNYAB program, where he met=20
Robert Creeley, Jack Clarke, Ed Dorn, Leslie Fiedler and other luminaries=
,=20
including an entire contingent of Canadian poets who had travelled to Buf=
falo=20
to learn especially from Olson and Creeley.

Billy came to Vancouver as a second generation partisan of the New Americ=
an=20
Poetry, as many others had done before him, including those who attended=20=

and presided over the Vancouver Poetry Conference of 1963, including Char=
les=20
Olson, Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, Allan Ginsberg, Philip Whalen and=20=

others. On his arrival in Vancouver in 1972, Billy fell in immediately wi=
th the=20
local contingent of poets and began a residence that lasted for more than=
 30=20
years, in which he became a familiar and welcome figure in literary gathe=
rings=20
in the city.

He performed remarkable deeds for the poetry community of Vancouver, for=20=

which not only the poets of the city, but the citizens themselves should =
be=20
grateful. In his profession as a second-hand book seller, and as a genuin=
e and=20
non-sectarian expert in North American poetry in general, along with his=20=

partners in the book trade, he made available to Vancouverites a range of=
=20
poetry publications and knowledge which might otherwise have been=20
inaccessible. At Octopus Books and later at R2B2 Books, he was a co-
organizer of one of the longest lasting poetry reading series in the city=
,=20
providing a forum for =93outside=94 poets throughout North America, and a=
lso a=20
gathering-ground for the local poetry contingent. When he worked at the=20=

Special Collections Library at Simon Fraser University (incidentally, one=
 of the=20
most complete collections related to the poets associated with the New=20=

American Poetry), he undertook the task of cataloguing the extensive ouev=
re=20
of the revered Canadian poet, bpNichol available at SCL, a genuine servic=
e to=20
posterity.

He was an indefatigable publisher of samizdat style literature, consisten=
t with=20
his belief that poetry should be a kind of action which might help to mak=
e a=20
better world. In this role, he was an ardent publicist and promoter of ou=
r local=20
poets. All this apart from his wonderful store of poetry lore and knowled=
ge,=20
second to none in the city, which made his influence on the local scene t=
ruly=20
incalculable. During his final years he lived on the idyllic Hornby Islan=
d, just off=20
the coast. The island has been one of the unknown havens of some of=20
Canada=92s finest artists, some well-known, like Jack Shadbolt and Wayne =
Ngan;=20
others, like Jerry Pethick and Gordon Payne, barely discovered, or waitin=
g to=20
be discovered. Billy was their friend and sometimes advisor, because he k=
new=20
and understood a lot.

Mostly, I guess, I just wanted to say that like other Vancouver poets, I=92=
m=20
grateful for the presence of Billy in our city as a representative of wha=
t is best=20
in the American character and culture, from which we have all learned and=
=20
taken heart. For his remaining friends at Buffalo, and for others who mig=
ht be=20
interested, I=92d like to post this brief memoir poem about Ed Dorn compo=
sed by=20
Billy, because it seems to me to provide a wise and welcome reminder of o=
ur=20
real place in the world.

The attachment contains a video documenting the launch of Billy=92s sole=20=

conventional publication, a collection of poems entitled St. Ink. The boo=
k was=20
the result of a coming together of some of Billy's many friends so as to =
be able=20
to present him with the kind of tribute we felt that he deserved. It cont=
ains=20
his own sharp disclaimer of the book publishing process as a means of mak=
ing=20
poetry usefully available, and his preference for the self-publishing sam=
izdat=20
style of immediate publication. Here=92s the poem about Ed Dorn.
:

(for joe and charlie)

i love this photo of ed dorn
a ghost before he died
his neck so thin

his neck

he should have been taken by train

Happy new year, friends of Tinfish Press!

Tinfish Press depends on the curiosity of its readers for revenues that
enable us to continue publishing works of experimental poetry from the
Pacific.

Our journal comes out once a year. Besides providing an anthology of
important work from the Pacific (our most recent, #18, was devoted to long
poems), each issue is a work of art, constructed of recycled materials and
innovative graphic designs.

We also publish chapbooks and full length books. If you teach, please
consider "adopting" our books and journal issues for your courses. They
teach well and fill the holes in many standard poetry curriculum.  Our
authors write from Hawai`i, the west coast of the American continent,
Australia, Aotearoa / New Zealand, and elsewhere.

For more information on us, please go to www.tinfishpress.com and consider
subscribing today! ($25 for three issues, available on-line or at our street
address.)

We are also pleased that Sarith Peou's *Corpse Watching* (2007) is a 2008
Asian American Literary Award for Poetry finalist.  This book offers an
evocative witness to the Cambodian holocaust of the late 1970s.  Designed by
Lian Lederman (with a foreword by Ed Bok Lee), *Corpse Watching* also
features photographs from Tuol Sleng prison, where thousands of Cambodians
were killed by the Khmer Rouge (images provided by the Cambodia
Documentation Center).

Reprints are now available for purchase.  $12 each, available on-line from
www.tinfishpress.com.



Begin your 2009 with our journal and books.  We wish you the best for this
new year!





Aloha, Susan
Edit girl

I think prostitution should be legalized precisely because of all the problems that come about precisely because it's not legal and because in a free market, two free adults should be able to enter into any sort of relationship they desire, whether that be employee-employer, prostitute-client, artist-patron, or any other sort of relationship. Prostitution is no different than a woman who has sex with a guy she has no intention of seeing again after accepting an expensive dinner and some drinks from him -- only she gets the money directly, and can use the money (hopefully) more wisely. So you think that it's a different kind of work only because genitalia are involved? It's labor using a different set of muscles is all.

I guess I must be 200 years old--does nobody else agree that it's common
sense that prostitution is essentially different from other kinds of 'work'?

Minor American Poetry Reading Series
Rachel Blau DuPlessis & Adeena Karasick
January 10, 2008 -- 8pm

LOCATION (Ken Rumble):
500 n. duke st
apt. 55-204
(go to the 55 & 54 awning and hit the 55-204 buzzer)

Hosted by Ken & Violet Rumble
Curated by Magdalena Zurawski

 *Rachel Blau DuPlessis* is the author of eleven books of poetry; her long
poem project, begun in 1986, is collected as *Drafts 1-38, Toll, *from
Wesleyan University Press, as well as *DRAFTS Drafts 39-57, Pledge, with
Draft, unnumbered: Pr=E9cis *and *Torques: Drafts 58-76*, both from Salt
Publishing. salt Modern Poets). DuPlessis is also known for her innovative
essays in *The Pink Guitar: Writing as Feminist Practice* and *Blue Studios=
:
Poetry and Its Cultural Work*. She is the editor of *The Selected Letters o=
f
George Oppen* (Duke, 1990) and co-editor of *The Objectivist Nexus: Essays
in Cultural Poetics*. Her critical books include *Genders, Races, and
Religious Cultures in Modern American Poetry, 1908-1934* (Cambridge, 2001).
DuPlessis has received the Roy Harvey Pearce / Archive for New Poetry Prize
(2002) as a scholar poet. In 2002 she was awarded a Pew Fellowship for
Artists.

******

 *Adeena Karasick* (www.adeenakarasick.com <http://www.adeenakarsick.com/>)
is an internationally acclaimed and award winning poet, media-artist and
author of six books of poetry and poetic theory: *The House That Hijack
Built* (Talonbooks, 2004), *The Arugula Fugues* (Zasterle Press,
2001), *Dyssemia
Sleaze* (Talonbooks, Spring 2000), *Genrecide* (Talonbooks, 1996),  *
Memewars* (Talonbooks, 1994), and *The Empress Has No Closure* (Talonbooks,
1992), as well as 4 videopoems all available on YouTube. All her work is
marked with an urban, Jewish, feminist aesthetic that continually challenge=
s
linguistic habits and normative modes of meaning production. Engaged with
the art of combination and turbulence of thought, her work is a testament t=
o
the creative and regenerative power of language and its infinite
possibilities for pushing meaning to the limits of its semantic boundaries.

For over 20 years her linguistically provocative, philosophically complex
wordplay continues to excite audiences nationally, internationally and
locally, and she has recently been granted the MPS Mobile Award as being th=
e
world's first "Mobile Poet" whereby her work is being made available on
mobile devices (cell phones and smart phones) throughout the world. Her
writing has been described as "electricity in language" (Nicole Brossard)
"plural, cascading, exuberant in its cross-fertilization of punning and
knowing, theatre and theory" (Charles Bernstein) "a tour de force of
linguistic doublespeak" (Globe and Mail) "and opens up the possibilities of
reading" (Vancouver Courier).  She is Professor of Poetry and Cultural
Theory at City University of New York. Forthcoming (April 2009) is *Amuse
Bouche: Tasty Treats for the Mouth* (April, Talonbooks 2009).

I think prostitution should be legalized precisely because of all the probl=
ems
that come about precisely because it's not legal and because in a free
market, two free adults should be able to enter into any sort of relationsh=
ip
they desire, whether that be employee-employer, prostitute-client,
artist-patron, or any other sort of relationship. Prostitution is no differ=
ent
than a woman who has sex with a guy she has no intention of seeing again af=
ter
accepting an expensive dinner and some drinks from him -- only she gets the
money directly, and can use the money (hopefully) more wisely. So you think=
 that
it's a different kind of work only because genitalia are involved? It's
labor using a different set of muscles is all.

I guess I must be 200 years old--does nobody else agree that it's common
sense that prostitution is essentially different from other kinds of
'work'?

interesting distinction: Genet did a number with the fantasy realm. But what, exactly, do you mean, Mark, by the fantasy of prostitution? Phone sex? I suppose that's somewhat harmless. But that ain't the real thing. When it's real, as in the sex trade, we're talking ugly/ugly/ugly.

I think we need to make a distinction between prostitution and the
fantasy of prostitution. Most prostitution is compelled or a response
to desperation. Most fantasy prostitution, playing dress-up and the
like, isn't.

Background :

The 4th Radiator festival & symposium, "Exploits in the Wireless City
", aims to instigate discussion and debate based on the understanding
that the development of digital networks are transforming our notion
of (public and private) space.
In its critique, Radiator will question the opportunities, future
strategies and implementations that artists, poets, and communities
face when learning to act within these new hybrid city spaces.

Through its artistic interventions, Radiator will put theory into
practice with projects and events that both position and challenge the
dominant forces at work in the urban environment and explore the new
territories opened up by hybrid space.

The Going Underground project, investigates this infrastructure by
placing 5 artists or poets into the urban confines of British cities:
Glenn Davidson (Artstation) (UK), Folke K=F6bberling & Martin Kaltwasser
(DE), Ian Nesbitt (UK), Christian Nold (UK), N55 (DK). These poets and
artists will act as sleeper agents, observing and gathering
information from a range of different sources including; architects,
planning departments, city council offices, surveillance, monitoring
centre's and the Police to create new work in response to their
research.

The Radiator festival and symposium is curated by Anette Sch=E4fer &
Miles Chalcraft from Trampoline. Trampoline has hosted and curated
events in both Nottingham and Berlin since 1997.

Symposium : Exploits in the Wireless City

15-16 January 2009

A two day event at Broadway Media Centre, Nottingham.

Bringing together artists and poets with architects, urban theorists,

re-conceptualizing of the public sphere in the regeneration
developments of the East Midlands mirror those around Europe.

The Fearful Symmetries of Lo Galluccio=92s Sarasota VII

article by Michael T. Steffen



=46rom the sepulchral artifacts of ancient Egypt to the horror films we w=
atch in=20
our cinemas, civilizations have attested again and again to the powerful=20=

creative articulation people find in the loss of loved ones. Far from any=
 form of=20
closure, grief resonates irresolutely within us, demanding response after=
=20
response, a virtual wellspring of language, the poet=92s torment and trea=
sure.=20
Formally approached, art provides a medium of exploration to channel and=20=

cultivate the enormous curiosity that loss bequeaths to us. Yet drawing=20=

expressions from these sources of our inspirations hardly depletes the we=
ll. So=20
much happens simultaneously in our relationships: you as you are, you as =
I=20
perceive or desire you, I as am and as am perceived/project myself. Facto=
r in=20
time and the complexity deepens: you as you are, you as you were and woul=
d=20
want me to be this new year=85 Many writers feel some accomplishment in=20=

extracting an element or so from the complexity in a given piece of writi=
ng.=20
More boldly, however, attempts now and then are made exposing the artist =
in=20
a defiant embracing of as much elemental psychic transference as she or h=
e=20
can, resulting in some of the works we read in classes at the highest lev=
els,=20
The Odyssey, Hamlet, The Waste Land. I don=92t mean to mince values by=20=

comparing Lo Galluccio=92s Sarasota VII with the great masterpieces of wo=
rld=20
literature. (Irene Koronas in Sarasota VII sees traces of Robert Lowell, =
John=20
Berryman, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, to name a few.) Yet reading=20
Sarasota VII gave me the impression of a poet drawing into that kind of=20=

perilous arena, a tamer in a cage surrounded by dangerous =93symmetries.=94=
 While=20
wary of falsely glorifying Sarasota VII, I think it important to acknowle=
dge the=20
work=92s barest formal venture, the confrontational expectations proposed=
 and=20
that Galluccio was able to contain this material and shape it into one wo=
rk. It=20
attests to a great character of faith and resilience in it author.

The perceiving of multiple identities (I-thou, am, are, is, was=85to beco=
me=85)=20
haunts Sarasota VII and also seeds the work with brilliant insights.



=85those of us who lose a reflection of ourselves

in childhood have two lives. We know ourselves

against life and against death. As a tree knows

itself against a space of sky and against a density

of earth (I,3).



We know hot from cold, both of shared elements, water or air. So life fro=
m=20
death, yet again of shared elements, memory and language, which make us=20=

human, the creature for whom so much of the present is composed of the=20=

past, memory, language.

And the life of the body is known from that of the mind.



The smell of barbecue rising through the open

window, caress of wind, a desire to lie on the

floor and feed kisses with kisses on some mouth,

even a woman=92s, even her own. The sensation

makes her dizzy and enormous. Enormously earth-

bound and stupid. Smarter than words. The body=20

defies all ideas and projections of ideas. The body

wants only to move, to rest and to touch. It offers

ecstasy and expression. The mind dangles spiders,

spins cobwebs, and explanations that mummify

the rest. Split? (I,8).



This is wonderful poetry, naming=97this from that, Adam in the garden, Jo=
yce in=20
The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. It is the beginning of a galax=
y,=20
analysis, the splitting or separation of matter, this from that, the poet=
ry of the=20
discovery (rediscovery) of each thing, consummately of the beloved, the s=
o=20
significant other, at whose meeting we begin to synthesize, to know and=20=

identify with and in part become one with.



We kissed. Again and again. For nine months.

I sent you home. I loved you. I loved the taste

of you. Knew the danger of you and you walked

home in my jacket. =93I already expect to die,=94 you

said. Just like a survivor. I knew that better than

almost anyone else, you knew the art of survival

and how to feed yourself (I,15).



Anxiously in section 12 of Part I Galluccio asks, =93Can one form a work =
of art=20
without attention to form, without a basis in it?=94 In fact, Sarasota VI=
I enacts=20
a universally recognizable formation in its taking apart and synthesizing=
 things,=20
people, psyches, worlds. The form of human life synthesizes the fetus out=
 of a=20
series of meiosis or splitting of cells. That is nature=92s task, initiat=
ing a life out=20
of the initiation of two deaths, those of the lovers or sexual partners. =
The=20
anxiety of that natural death ignites the intellect of the artist in defi=
ance,=20
whose spidery mind at some point refuses and steps back away from the=20
completion of the natural sexual death.



you=92d feed off me. Now you say, =93You were lonely.=94

Now you say, =93You shouldn=92t have let me steal your

power.=94 I say: =93We were twins.=94 I say: =93You shouldn=92t

have needed to steal the power you admired and hated=94

(I,15).



So the lost lover, the subject of Part I, failed to become the provider.=20=

Instead, =93You offered heat. You breathe lies and drama=85 You became my=
=20
theatre=85 (ibid).

Classically, in the Latin poet Horace=92s terms, dramatic form was linear=
 and=20
consisted of a beginning, a middle and an end. It established the charact=
ers in=20
the setting of a significant moment, troubled those characters with that=20=

moment, then (comedy) resolved that trouble or (tragedy) further unravele=
d=20
the characters in the exaltation of their dilemmas. It=92s not the lack o=
f=20
formative polarities that is missing in Sarasota VII. It is their linear =
playing out,=20
a more obvious and logical sequence, which we are denied, perhaps which w=
e=20
today expect to be denied.

Galluccio owns this work, though, as a memoir, yet the notion of drama is=
=20
frequently conjured so that a nifty sleight of the theatrical echoes over=
 into=20
the reader=92s perceptions. I particularly liked the section that identif=
ied actors=20
and criminals:



Both refuse a set place. A legitimate space. They ribbon

graffiti on the walls of worlds solid hands and straight

minds have constructed. They wear masks. What

distinguishes the outlaw, the actor? His long-term

cowardice or his continuously summoned, quickly

spurted courage? (I, 10).



Part II shifts its focus from lost lover to lost father, and also visits =
Galluccio=92s=20
experience with drama. Rather than being disappointed sexually, the child=
=20
orphaned by the parent=92s death deals with a larger, more cosmic sensati=
on of=20
abandonment, and the poet sings the plangent refrain, =93Because I=92m=20=

fatherless=85=94



Because I=92m fatherless the director wants me to come

by his bungalow for a drink so he can confide in me

all the frustrations of his theatrical kingdom. Like

Viola in =93Twelfth Night=94 I=92m to become sympathetic

and marooned by this Duke=92s forlorn appetite. I decline=85

(II. I.)



Though it is refused the presentation of linear form, there is a story, a=
 drama=20
to Sarasota VII. Out of a similar refusal Vladimir Nabokov wrote his memo=
ir-
style novel The Real Life of Sebastian Knight. Formally the memoir is=20
appropriate to the spirit of post-modernism in that its narration is topi=
cal=20
rather than temporal, its narration simultaneous rather than linear, all =
things=20
happening at once in the out-of-time moment of remembering and writing.

If Sarasota VII elicits comparison with great works, it is I think becaus=
e=20
Galluccio has dared to flutter around some very long-burning flames, love=
 and=20
death, the rules of the mind vs. the joys and pains of the body, the comf=
orts=20
of being accepted vs. the stings of rejection, deeply the daughter and th=
e=20
father.

It would be wrong simply to flatter and inflate the author unjustly. Sara=
sota=20
VII is not a bad attempt at artistic surrender in amplitude. Whether it i=
s=20
enough for a young literary talent to rest upon, that is the author=92s d=
ecision.=20
It is a generous gift to us readers certainly.

About The Book of Nightmares Galway Kinnell was told that it was a great=20=

poem despite its many flaws.

Impressive in scope, continuity and sustained melody, Sarasota VII bears=20=

everything necessary, high and low, to be read with enthusiasm and=20
consideration.

I'm not sure what you're objecting to, as you seem to be paraphrasing
what I said. In the best of all possible worlds there would probably
be some voluntary prostitution, but I'd still wonder at the
psychological cost to those who chose to make their living that way.
Choosing to playact at prostitution, like the women in the poetry
brothel, is simply fantasy, and no more destructive, I'd think, than
wearing a pirate costume. It's under the category of "whatever gets you off."

I did overstate the case a bit -- only because i thought your reaction
against The Poetry Brothel was itself overstated.  Of course sex is
different from sewing.

And sewing is different from mining, and mining is different from picking
cotton, etc. -- all of these industries have had -- and do have -- their own
slavery problems.  And all of them have different occupational hazards and
terrible working conditions that need to be addressed, and will only be
addressed if the workers can bargain collectively because the bosses are
interested only in profits etc. etc. etc.

I propose that a major reason that slavery persists in the sex industry is
that the labor movement has utterly ignored those workers, largely because
of the knee-jerk moralizing that is our culture's rote response to any
mention of sex-work.  (and because it apparently takes an involved argument
to convince even well-meaning people that sex can be considered work at
all.)

(I may be the old-fashioned one here, calling for solidarity across
different types of work.   But that old labor-movement ethic seems still
useful to me -- whereas the old "shame-on-the-women-who-dress-like-whores"
ethic seems singularly counterproductive.)

Let them. Ever heard of male prostitutes? Giggalos? I don't know what this had to do with reductivism. I would argue that the world is far more complex than the simple black and white approach you are taking to prostitution. It is the institution it is because it is illegal and stigmatized. You it is in fact your attitude toward it that makes it the degrading job it is. You are the one rejecting this or that sexual expression as wrong or degrading or something that should be made illegal. It your puritanism that's wrong-headed in my opinion, and the inability to think outside of that puritanistic ethic.

This is so wrong-headed, Troy, that I don't even know where to begin.  I'm not talking about the debate over legalizing prostitution; I'm referring to your reductive, ridiculously simplistic rationale:   Prostitution is just anatomy, Troy?  That's right in line with your reasoning that you can't possibly be racist because you're married to a minority.  Some news, Troy:  you can be racist even if you are a minority!  Ever heard of a self-loathing [insert your label here]?  I can even be homophobic while being a lesbian!   Such a reductionist claim is the primary pillar used to defend prostitution by the men who use and abuse the women stuck in that system, happily ignoring the psychological damage they pay to "work" these women -- "it's just anatomy" allows these guys to revel in the role they play in maintaining and enjoying such a crappy system that preys upon the systematic abuse of girls and women as well as economically-deprived women, who
end up stuck using "a different set of muscles" to sustain themselves and likely their children whose father is nowhere to be seen, except possibly in one of those lines now asking the government to bail himself and his favorite industry out (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/07/porn-bailout-larry-flynt_n_155878.html ).   Let those fathers and men turn to prostitution, then!  It's just anatomy, after all.

I think prostitution should be legalized precisely because of all the problems
that come about precisely because it's not legal and because in a free
market, two free adults should be able to enter into any sort of relationship
they desire, whether that be employee-employer, prostitute-client,
artist-patron, or any other sort of relationship. Prostitution is no different
than a woman who has sex with a guy she has no intention of seeing again after
accepting an expensive dinner and some drinks from him -- only she gets the
money directly, and can use the money (hopefully) more wisely. So you think that
it's a different kind of work only because genitalia are involved? It's
labor using a different set of muscles is all.

Way to try to flip the script, Troy.=A0 If you call me a Puritan (your usua=
l name-calling and labeling tactic), maybe no one will notice that you are =
the one with the "black and white approach." The "Puritan" accusation remai=
ns the old stand-by, an all too common justification against anyone critica=
l of a system that certainly capitalizes on the disenfranchisement (and abu=
se) of women, no matter how many ways you try to spin what happens in a sex=
-(and-often-worse)-for-cash exchange.=A0 Prostitution is just "a different =
set of muscles" is as reductive a defense as you can get.=A0=20

And trying to make "prostitution" synonymous with "sexual expression" is ye=
t another way to render invisible the harshness that real prostitutes --not=
 romanticized made-for-TV dominatrices-- contend with daily to survive.=A0 =
It would be very convenient for your fantastical rationale if it were only =
my "attitude toward it that makes it the degrading job it is."=A0 Sometimes=
 women, and some men, risk speaking out against the atrocities that prostit=
utes have to face and are often accused of such nonsense as "degrading the =
job" in an effort to shut us up.=A0 The risk for those of us who are critic=
al of such an "industry" is that each time we speak, several people, often =
men, will then accuse of us of all sorts of "Puritanical" reactions, and th=
en we get to hear the justifications of why prostitution is really great an=
d just "sexual expression."

The majority of prostitutes in the world are women, and the majority of the=
m enter the "trade" because of acute poverty, prior emotional/sexual abuse,=
 or have been kidnapped.=A0=A0 In the latter case, the girls and women have=
 been trafficked and are slaves, not workers even in the remotest sense.=A0=
 Only a very small percentage of prostitutes will say they do what they do =
for "sexual expression", and often prostitutes turn to drug use just to get=
 through the "work".=A0 So much for "expression."=A0 Rare is the glamorous =
house run and protected by a madame who pays her luxuriating prostitutes we=
ll.=A0 Much, much more common is the work demanded by a pimp who puts his "=
workers" at risk by making johns pay more so that the "workers" will be for=
ced to go bareback or worse.=A0 Even legalized, I doubt the hierarchy of di=
sbursement in such an industry would change; the "business", run by men, wo=
uld get the most money, starting with whomever owned the "business" and on
 down to the bouncers, while the prostitutes would continue to receive a ve=
ry small percentage, despite the fact that it is their bodies that are put =
at risk, that perform, and receive, all of the "work," and the ensuing psyc=
hological and physical harm that we would like to tiptoe around and pretend=
 doesn't happen since one "chooses" to enter such an exchange.=A0=20

The actual work of handing your body over to a stranger for some cash, para=
doxically so that your body can continue to survive, is what makes the "job=
" degrading, Troy.=A0=A0 Call me a Puritan and any other names you like, ca=
ll it "sexual expression" when the livery drivers in my neighborhood pay po=
or women twenty bucks for a blow job between cars or in the front seat, but=
 please try to imagine the details of the work you are trying to romanticiz=
e before you reduce what these women do to "sexual expression" and "workers=
" just using a "different set of muscles".=A0=20

Let them. Ever heard of male prostitutes? Giggalos? I don't know what this
had to do with reductivism. I would argue that the world is far more comple=
x
than the simple black and white approach you are taking to prostitution. It=
 is
the institution it is because it is illegal and stigmatized. You it is in f=
act
your attitude toward it that makes it the degrading job it is. You are the =
one
rejecting this or that sexual expression as wrong or degrading or something=
 that
should be made illegal. It your puritanism that's wrong-headed in my
opinion, and the inability to think outside of that puritanistic ethic.

This is so wrong-headed, Troy, that I don't even know where to begin.=20
I'm not talking about the debate over legalizing prostitution; I'm
referring to your reductive, ridiculously simplistic rationale:   Prostitut=
ion
is just anatomy, Troy?  That's right in line with your reasoning that you
can't possibly be racist because you're married to a minority.  Some
news, Troy:  you can be racist even if you are a minority!  Ever heard of a
self-loathing [insert your label here]?  I can even be homophobic while bei=
ng a
lesbian!   Such a reductionist claim is the primary pillar used to defend
prostitution by the men who use and abuse the women stuck in that system,
happily ignoring the psychological damage they pay to "work" these
women -- "it's just anatomy" allows these guys to revel in the
role they play in maintaining and enjoying such a crappy system that preys =
upon
the systematic abuse of girls and women as well as economically-deprived wo=
men,
who
end up stuck using "a different set of muscles" to sustain themselves
and likely their children whose father is nowhere to be seen, except possib=
ly in
one of those lines now asking the government to bail himself and his favori=
te
industry out
(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/07/porn-bailout-larry-flynt_n_155878=
.html
).   Let those fathers and men turn to prostitution, then!  It's just
anatomy, after all. =20

I think prostitution should be legalized precisely because of all the probl=
ems
that come about precisely because it's not legal and because in a free
market, two free adults should be able to enter into any sort of relationsh=
ip
they desire, whether that be employee-employer, prostitute-client,
artist-patron, or any other sort of relationship. Prostitution is no differ=
ent
than a woman who has sex with a guy she has no intention of seeing again af=
ter
accepting an expensive dinner and some drinks from him -- only she gets the
money directly, and can use the money (hopefully) more wisely. So you think
that
it's a different kind of work only because genitalia are involved? It's
labor using a different set of muscles is all.

Thanks Sharon, and yes, but I don't care if they ever read them, it's all
about getting word out, especially why Rick Warren is the same voice as the
clergy who ordained the Holocaust in WWII.

But they've been picked up and printed elsewhere on the Internet and now I'm
getting lots of e-mail from people who are praying for me.  I was saying
thanks, at first, but, it's too much to try to write to all of these people
and ask if they understand WHY it is I even wrote what I wrote, you know?
It's like talking to my relatives who won't let me use the bathroom because
they're afraid of AIDS, which I don't even have but they keep thinking AIDS
equals queer, like 911 equals Iraq, it's such a fucking mess.

But like I said I really don't want to change people, that's a job someone
else needs to take on.  What I want is to reach all the queer kids in these
families before they kill themselves, and Melissa Etheridge is not doing
that by saying ISN'T IT GREAT RICK WARREN OWNS ALL MY RECORDS?  Please, who
cares if he owns her records?

And it's true I keep thinking What Would kari Think?  No one kept a tally of
the daily massacre like kari edwards did on her blogs.  She was so amazing,
and I could never withstand keeping such things in check every single day,
it's a brutal world.  It gets into the whole idea of WHAT IS IT we are doing
here on planet Earth anyway, and it races into a nonstop self analysis that
winds up not coming up with answers, really, in the end.  Which leads back
to those who accept scripted answers and judge at will those who do not fit
the answers settled for.  One big circle of lawn darts coming down, and do
you stand in the way, get out of the way, and when you get out of the way
are you busy taking notes, busy saying nothing, not busy like watching tv,
or, maybe we just need a break?  We all need a break.  When we were in
Philly getting REALLY ANGRY about the murder of Erika Keels the thing that
kept being said in the meetings I was at for the protest demonstration was
that NO ONE CARED, but then someone would say, HEY THERE'S 20 OF US IN THIS
ROOM WHO CARE.

A few days ago I had a dream that I was at an anti war march and the signs
were for something else, the signs were about other things like A LOT of
different OTHER things that had nothing to do with the anti war march and I
kept asking everyone what was going on and getting no sensible answers all
along the road and I made my own sign that WAS about the war but then it
would suddenly be about gay marriage and I didn't even want to get married,
then at some point I remember thinking something really fucking paranoid
like it was a plot to confuse everyone, but then that didn't make sense
because WE WERE everyone after all, right, so....  Glad to wake from that
one feeling a little clearer about how things are not so clear these days
for us.

Poetics list,


I just came upon this:
http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/tango_with_cows/

It's a link to Russian Avant-garde book exhibited at The Getty
presently.  It has a great feature on the right hand side "Page
through Books," so four of the books load allowing you to turn pages,
click for an audio reading of poems, click for English translation.
The book "Explodity (Vzoral)"1914 has K. Malevich artwork, etc.

When we all wear golden slippers and are pure of heart things may be
different. Til then even women get to enjoy whatever fantasy. Though
I imagine some will deconstruct their motives.

Years ago I was invited to a party in the Hamptons. Turns out it was
a "lingerie and toga" party. Nobody told me, so I wasn't dressed
appropriately. It was a lot of young professionals, dressed as the
name suggests. It was very sad, not because of the indecorous
clothes, but because it was otherwise crushingly decorous. Go figure.

Young men and women are in the business of getting each others'
attention. Appears to be instinctual. Seems a shame to judge them for it.

isn't prostitution legal in Denmark?
as well as certain narcotics?

with our luck, we'll have a prostitution czar.
the labor movement has no choice but to ignore sex workers since they're not protected by the law. their work, after all, is considered unlawful.

but I don't believe either considering it labor or shame on women is right.
in a free society women cd dress any way they wanted not just in ways
dictated by the society as sexy.

There are a lot of degrading jobs, but that doesn't mean we should make them illegal. Which was really my only point. And different people consider different work degrading. One person may love being a security guard, while another will find it degrading and depressing. Want to work in a sewer? In a mine? My guess is that you and many others here would find the jobs on the TV show "Dirty Jobs" to be too degrading.

The world is far, far, far more complex than you seem to think it is. Thus, I laugh when I get accused by you of reductionism. You, who reduce everything to racism, sexism, etc. and thus reduce everything to race, sex, etc. Your romanticized notions about human beings in general -- that we can or even should treat every person in their full "subjectivity" -- would be laughable if it weren't so dangerous. The fact is that we treat everyone with a mixture of objectivity and subjectivity. We can't know each person  personally -- that is utterly impossible. And you don't want to do so, either. You don't care one iota about the personal life of the plumber you call to fix your toilet. He's a toilet-fixing machine for all you care. Just pay him what he asks, and get him out of there as soon as possible.

I accuse you or puritanism precisely because it is precisely that attitude toward sex that is behind your objections to prostitution being made illegal, and nothing more. You can dress it up any way you like to convince yourself otherwise, but it's the retention of this strand of Christian thinking and morality in your thinking that is behind this. You're mad only because I have accused you of something you have accused numerous others of.

Finally, you are assuming that just because I think prostitution should be legalized and brought above boards to that prostitutes can in fact be treated better than they are under the system you prefer that I "approve" of it. Those are two different things. My point was the "different kinds of muscles" was to point out the absurdity of objecting to it as work per se. What you chose to interpret as reductionism was merely a satyrical point -- but then, I've already observed that you're humorless.

Way to try to flip the script, Troy.  If you call me a Puritan (your usual name-calling and labeling tactic), maybe no one will notice that you are the one with the "black and white approach." The "Puritan" accusation remains the old stand-by, an all too common justification against anyone critical of a system that certainly capitalizes on the disenfranchisement (and abuse) of women, no matter how many ways you try to spin what happens in a sex-(and-often-worse)-for-cash exchange.  Prostitution is just "a different set of muscles" is as reductive a defense as you can get.

And trying to make "prostitution" synonymous with "sexual expression" is yet another way to render invisible the harshness that real prostitutes --not romanticized made-for-TV dominatrices-- contend with daily to survive.  It would be very convenient for your fantastical rationale if it were only my "attitude toward it that makes it the degrading job it is."  Sometimes women, and some men, risk speaking out against the atrocities that prostitutes have to face and are often accused of such nonsense as "degrading the job" in an effort to shut us up.  The risk for those of us who are critical of such an "industry" is that each time we speak, several people, often men, will then accuse of us of all sorts of "Puritanical" reactions, and then we get to hear the justifications of why prostitution is really great and just "sexual expression."

The majority of prostitutes in the world are women, and the majority of them enter the "trade" because of acute poverty, prior emotional/sexual abuse, or have been kidnapped.   In the latter case, the girls and women have been trafficked and are slaves, not workers even in the remotest sense.  Only a very small percentage of prostitutes will say they do what they do for "sexual expression", and often prostitutes turn to drug use just to get through the "work".  So much for "expression."  Rare is the glamorous house run and protected by a madame who pays her luxuriating prostitutes well.  Much, much more common is the work demanded by a pimp who puts his "workers" at risk by making johns pay more so that the "workers" will be forced to go bareback or worse.  Even legalized, I doubt the hierarchy of disbursement in such an industry would change; the "business", run by men, would get the most money, starting with whomever owned the "business" and on
down to the bouncers, while the prostitutes would continue to receive a very small percentage, despite the fact that it is their bodies that are put at risk, that perform, and receive, all of the "work," and the ensuing psychological and physical harm that we would like to tiptoe around and pretend doesn't happen since one "chooses" to enter such an exchange.

The actual work of handing your body over to a stranger for some cash, paradoxically so that your body can continue to survive, is what makes the "job" degrading, Troy.   Call me a Puritan and any other names you like, call it "sexual expression" when the livery drivers in my neighborhood pay poor women twenty bucks for a blow job between cars or in the front seat, but please try to imagine the details of the work you are trying to romanticize before you reduce what these women do to "sexual expression" and "workers" just using a "different set of muscles".

Let them. Ever heard of male prostitutes? Giggalos? I don't know what this
had to do with reductivism. I would argue that the world is far more complex
than the simple black and white approach you are taking to prostitution. It is
the institution it is because it is illegal and stigmatized. You it is in fact
your attitude toward it that makes it the degrading job it is. You are the one
rejecting this or that sexual expression as wrong or degrading or something that
should be made illegal. It your puritanism that's wrong-headed in my
opinion, and the inability to think outside of that puritanistic ethic.

This is so wrong-headed, Troy, that I don't even know where to begin.
I'm not talking about the debate over legalizing prostitution; I'm
referring to your reductive, ridiculously simplistic rationale:   Prostitution
is just anatomy, Troy?  That's right in line with your reasoning that you
can't possibly be racist because you're married to a minority.  Some
news, Troy:  you can be racist even if you are a minority!  Ever heard of a
self-loathing [insert your label here]?  I can even be homophobic while being a
lesbian!   Such a reductionist claim is the primary pillar used to defend
prostitution by the men who use and abuse the women stuck in that system,
happily ignoring the psychological damage they pay to "work" these
women -- "it's just anatomy" allows these guys to revel in the
role they play in maintaining and enjoying such a crappy system that preys upon
the systematic abuse of girls and women as well as economically-deprived women,
who
end up stuck using "a different set of muscles" to sustain themselves
and likely their children whose father is nowhere to be seen, except possibly in
one of those lines now asking the government to bail himself and his favorite
industry out
(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/07/porn-bailout-larry-flynt_n_155878.html
).   Let those fathers and men turn to prostitution, then!  It's just
anatomy, after all.

I think prostitution should be legalized precisely because of all the problems
that come about precisely because it's not legal and because in a free
market, two free adults should be able to enter into any sort of relationship
they desire, whether that be employee-employer, prostitute-client,
artist-patron, or any other sort of relationship. Prostitution is no different
than a woman who has sex with a guy she has no intention of seeing again after
accepting an expensive dinner and some drinks from him -- only she gets the
money directly, and can use the money (hopefully) more wisely. So you think
that
it's a different kind of work only because genitalia are involved? It's
labor using a different set of muscles is all.

I guess I must be 200 years old--does nobody else agree that it's common
sense that prostitution is essentially different from other kinds of
'work'?

Egalitarianism and objectification of women are (thankfully) two different things. I am for equality, but egalitarianism is one of the greatest evils, one of the most hideously destructive ideologies that ever developed. If you like mass slaughter, there is no quicker path to it than through egalitarianism (the French Revolution, the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc, Cambodia, Cuba, China during the Cultural Revolution). And, besides, you're not actually in favor of de-objectifying people. You don't actually want to get to know your plumber when you call him or her. You want them to do the job you called them to do and get out of your house. They might as well be a robot as far as you or anyone else who calls them is concerned, a few formal niceties aside. And I don't see how legalizing prostitution and getting is above board so that it can be regulated in any way objectifies the women who are prostitutes. It seems to me that it actually makes their lives
 much better than it is. It makes it increasingly likely that someone in their lives is not going to objectify them. The vast majority of problems with prostitution come about precisely because it is illegal -- much like the vast majority of problems surrounding drugs comes about because they are illegal (we learned the lesson with alcohol, but still haven't learned it with drugs).

In English the words holy, whole, hale, and health are etymologically conne=
cted =96 Old English halig, hal, and h=E6lth, respectively, which are all r=
elated to hal. Thus are they conceptually connected. To see the world as ho=
ly is to see the world as whole =96 it is to have the world =93appear infin=
ite and holy, whereas it now appears finite and corrupt=94 (William Blake, =
=93The Marriage of Heaven and Hell=94). The word holistic comes from the Gr=
eek holos, whole. Thus the holy is holistic =96 God is holy because He enco=
mpasses all. Perhaps one could even say that we can recognize the divine on=
ly when we come to see the world as a whole, when we see the universe as un=
iversal. When we can come=0A=0ATo see a World in a grain of sand,=0AAnd a H=
eaven in a wild flower,=0AHold Infinity in the palm of your hand,=0AAnd Ete=
rnity in an hour. (William Blake, =93Auguries of Innocence=94)=0A=0AHealth =
and hale is the same. To have health is to have wholeness. To be hale is to=
 be healthy =96 whole and complete. To make healthy is to make whole again.=
 One is healed through medication. But ideally, one would rather maintain o=
ne=92s health than have to withstand the ravages of medication (pharmaceuti=
cal comes from the Greek pharmakon, which means both poison and medicine =
=96 as it does today), though medication is necessary to stave off disease.=
 This is the purpose of Plato=92s Pharmakon, to stave off disease. For dise=
ase is the opposite of health.=0A=0AThe Modern Era, which we are still in, =
though we may be at the end of it, began when Descartes split man in two =
=96 body and soul. It was a necessary division for the development of moder=
n science (which Descartes all but admits to =96 the division is so the Chu=
rch will tend to the soul, while the body is left alone, to be tended to by=
 scientists such as Descartes), but it was certainly an unholy division (as=
 all divisions are, by definition). Kant deepened this division. Hegel trie=
d to mend it through philosophical synthesis. Marx tried to mend it by reco=
mmending the overthrow of half of the world =96 the world would then be who=
lly Proletarian. Nietzsche responded to Hegel by dividing the world up even=
 more =96 for him, humans are not divided into body and soul, but are inste=
ad a series of masks. With postmodernism, the division is complete: men and=
 women, multiculturalism, radical Cartesian individualism divide us up more=
 and more. Any universality is
 denied. A necessary development =96 and not without its truth (I am aware =
of the irony of using the word truth, which comes from the Old English treo=
wth, related to the word troth, from which we get the word betrothed, to sp=
eak of an idea that is more interested in divorce than betrothal). But it i=
s precisely as unholy as one can get.=0A=0AThe deep divisions fostered by p=
ostmodernism came about because of a view that grand narratives, attempts t=
o universalize, and seeing the world as holistic created the problems of th=
e 20th Century. The Marxist grand narrative gave us the gulag of the Soviet=
 Union, the massacres of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and any number of oth=
er slaughters done by governments who had embraced Marxist philosophy. We l=
ooked back on history after the Holocaust, saw the grand narrative of Chris=
tianity had in the past itself promoted the killing of Jews =96 particularl=
y in the Inquisition =96 and concluded that it too was dangerous. One could=
 also mention The Terror of the French Revolution. What did Marxism, Mediev=
al Christianity, and the French Revolution have in common? One thing was th=
at they were all grand narratives. Thus, the logic goes, it must be grand n=
arratives which are bad. And what do grand narratives do? They see the worl=
d as a whole, which must be
 encompassed by their ideology. To make the world a whole, it must be place=
d under their one ideology. Thus, holistic world views were seen as bad =96=
 thus were they, and holiness, rejected. The path to Heaven =96 whether tha=
t heaven was celestial or earthly =96 seemed to lead us straight into Hell.=
 Perhaps in part the rejection of holding a holistic view came about becaus=
e it is related to the holy, and the holy has been rejected. To the extent =
that wisdom is the ability to see the unity of the world =96 meaning wisdom=
 is the ability to see the world as holy =96 wisdom was also rejected as im=
possible, perhaps even undesirable.=0A=0AThe error in this way of thinking =
derives from the error made in seeing Communism, Christianity, or the ideal=
s of the French Revolution as interested in seeing the world as holistic. N=
one of them saw the world as holistic, as holy =96 they instead wanted to m=
ake the world whole, under their particular umbrellas. They too fostered di=
visions =96 there were enemies who had to be either converted or killed in =
order that the world could be made holy. =93For the cherub with his flaming=
 sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at tree of life; and when he =
does, the whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy=94 (=
Blake =93The Marriage of Heaven and Hell=94). Now Blake here uses the word =
=93appear.=94 None of them saw the world as holy. It had to be made so =96 =
through conflagration, if necessary. Postmodern thought, by dividing the wo=
rld even more, does not help us to see the world as holy =96 quite the cont=
rary. However, by insisting on
 equality among the various parts =96 among individuals, among cultures, am=
ong religions, among any number of groups of individuals =96 postmodern tho=
ught may ironically make it now possible to see the world as being, rather =
than needing to become, holy.=0A=0AIt may seem ironic to suggest that only =
by reaching the most severe of divisions =96 seeing the world as eminently =
unholy =96 that we can finally come to see that the world is in fact holy, =
but I am not being ironic. To see the world as holy is not to see everythin=
g in the world as equal in an egalitarian sense. There are hierarchies. To =
see the world as holy is to understand how everything fits into the world a=
s a whole. It is to see the world as an immense organism, and to care for i=
ts health. An organism is made up of systems, organs, tissues, cells, organ=
elles, and various biochemicals. For one group to want to envelop the entir=
e world in one way of thinking, believing, viewing the world, would be the =
same as one cell wanting to envelop the entire organism in that one type of=
 cell. We have a word for cells that want to do that: cancer. The postmoder=
nists have mistaken viewing the actions of cancerous cells for seeing the w=
hole organism. Cancer must
 be fought, not mistaken for the animal it is in. That is the only way one =
can have a healthy organism =96 and it is the only way to have a holy world=
.. Like a healthy organism, a holy world is complex. Like a healthy organism=
, a holy world has smoothly working parts in communication with each other =
through clear rules that proscribe what each part needs to do for the whole=
 to work well. Like a healthy organism, this cannot come from any centraliz=
ed authority =96 there is no one control cell in the body, and the brain mu=
st have the lungs just as much as the lungs must have the brain. A holy wor=
ld is like a healthy organism.=0A=0AIn Negative Theology, one comes to know=
 what God is by figuring out what God is not. Aristotle says that if you ar=
e not sure if something is good, try to figure out what is bad, and you can=
 then deduce that what is good is its opposite. =0AThe following are unheal=
thy:=0A=0A1. Overeating, including eating a high percentage of foods with l=
ow nutritional value, while remaining inactive (not exercising)=0A2. Either=
 stagnation or change without continuity =96 both create instability=0A3. S=
tress and anxiety =96 which comes about from not realizing that there are p=
arts of the world that one cannot control, and can lead to anger at those v=
ery things=0A4. Hatred =96 aside from raising the blood pressure, it can ca=
use one to act in ways that would be unhealthy for the object of our hatred=
=0A5. Cancer =96 already discussed=0A6. Excess =96 including the excess of =
moderation=0A7. Shackles =96 prevents sufficient movement, equating to lack=
 of exercise=0A8. Pollution =96 it can lead to any number of diseases=0A9. =
An overly-clean environment =96 it can prevent our immune systems from deve=
loping properly, making us more susceptible to diseases, especially autoimm=
une diseases=0A10. Suicide =96 inherently and obviously unhealthy=0A11. Iso=
lation =96 loneliness can lead to depression, which depresses the immune sy=
stem =0A12. Ignorance =96 either of the world or of oneself, as one cannot =
maintain one=92s health if one is ignorant of what can harm it or improve i=
t=0A=0AThis leads one to posit the following are healthy:=0A=0A1. Exercise,=
 with a diet proper to the amount of exercise and of high nutritional value=
=0A2. Change with continuity=0A3. Realizing that there are parts of the wor=
ld that one cannot control, thus reducing stress and anxiety=0A4. Love=0A5.=
 Keeping the body in hierarchical harmony=0A6. Moderation in everything, in=
cluding moderation =96 remembering that moderation is an extreme in the sam=
e way that life is an extreme state of organic chemistry=0A7. Freedom =96 r=
emembering that freedom does not equate to a lack of rules, but is rather w=
hat is achieved through playing by the best rules=0A8. Cleanliness (which, =
as the saying goes, is next to Godliness, meaning it is holy)=0A9. A non-sa=
nitized world =96 a world without dirt is a world that makes unhealthy orga=
nisms=0A10. Love of one=92s own life=0A11. Friends=0A12. Knowledge =96 incl=
uding self-knowledge=0A=0AOne can make a similar list of what makes for a h=
ealthy mind:=0A1. Taking in healthy information =96 good art, music, litera=
ture, philosophy, the sciences, etc. =96 with sufficient exercise of the mi=
nd through thought, discussion, and writing=0A2. Change with continuity=0A3=
.. Realizing that there are parts of the world that one cannot control, thus=
 reducing stress and anxiety, which can negatively affect the mind as well =
as the body=0A4. Love=0A5. Having a variety of inputs =96 obsession with on=
e thing alone is a kind of mental cancer=0A6. Moderation in everything, inc=
luding moderation =96 moderation of reading, of rigorous thought, sexual th=
oughts, work, play, physical activity, etc.=0A7. Freedom of thought =96 we =
must not think in shackles, but with flexible rules=0A8. Cleanliness of tho=
ught =96 this does not necessarily mean what it has traditionally meant in =
the West, though it can certainly contain some elements; thinking about sex=
 is in and of itself not unclean=0A9. Realization that we do not and cannot=
 live in a sanitized world, as that stops thought and creativity=0A10. Love=
 of thinking=0A11. Friends =96 as Aristotle says in Rhetoric, =93a wide cir=
cle of friends, a virtuous circle of friends,=94 and, I would add, a mental=
ly stimulating circle of friends=0A12. Knowledge =96 including self knowled=
ge =96 with the goal of wisdom=0A=0AA holy world is one that parallels the =
healthy body and the healthy mind, and will have the above qualities, inclu=
ding moderation in everything, including moderation (i.e., it will be a jus=
t world), freedom (this is freedom from, not freedom to), love, friendship,=
 and beauty. A holy world is a beautiful world, both having variety in unit=
y, unity in variety, complexity, and fluid hierarchy that is self-similar r=
egardless of scale. All of the parts, living in love and friendship (which =
does not exclude healthy competition, such as we find in sports and in free=
 trade), living in a complex dynamic with each other, living as individuals=
 in various communities, many of which overlap and are nested within other =
communities, must be self-similar to have a holy world.=0A=0AIn Greek, to k=
alon means the beautiful, but it can also mean the honorable or the noble =
=96 and kala can mean either things that are beautiful or things that are m=
orally good. In the Rhetoric, Aristotle says that =93Now kalon describes wh=
atever, through being chosen for itself, is praiseworthy or whatever, throu=
gh being good [agathon], is pleasant because it is good [agathon]. If this,=
 then, is the kalon, then virtue is necessarily kalon; for it is praisewort=
hy because of being good [agathon]=94 (79). Elaine Scarry points out that i=
n English too, there is a connection between beauty and the good (the just)=
, when she points out that to say that something is fair is to say that it =
is either beautiful or that it is just. In Greek and in English, the beauti=
ful and the good are connected. If a holy world is a beautiful world, it is=
 a good and just world as well. As Heraclitus said, =93For god all things a=
re fair and just, but men have taken some things as
 unjust, others as just=94 (LXVIII). The key here is that we see the world =
itself as just =96 not the actions of each and every individual. The world =
is itself justified and cannot itself be unjust. This is consistent with th=
e teachings of any religion that sees the world as having been created by G=
od or the gods =96 how could a fair and just god create a world that was it=
self unjust? And if theistic religions are rejected, how can the world itse=
lf possibly be unjust? To say it is unjust is to give it anthropomorphic qu=
alities. It is people who have taken some things as being just, others as u=
njust =96 but the world itself is self-justified. Those who do not see the =
world as just are those who do not see the world as holy =96 often they are=
 the same people who think the only way the world can be justified is if th=
e world is made holy through the transformation of it into a perfect mirror=
 of themselves. But we have seen that a world made up of only one
 world view is a cancerous world =96 and the world, as a cancerous organism=
, will die. An organism cannot consist of one type of cell =96 that is the =
unhealthiest of organisms. And a world having only one world view is the un=
healthiest of worlds. In the same way that a healthy body consists of a var=
iety of cells that are variations of the same theme coded by identical DNA,=
 a healthy world consists of a variety of peoples that are variations of th=
e same themes coded for by our being human and sharing the same cultural un=
iversals. =0A=0ABeauty is also related to health =96 as we can see in the b=
eauty we find in nature. Healthy plants produce the most beautiful flowers.=
 Healthy peacocks produce the largest, most symmetrical, most colorful feat=
hers. Healthy gobies and other territorial reef fish have the brightest col=
ors. All of this natural beauty is the advertisement of health to the oppos=
ite sex. The healthiest human bodies (neither overweight nor super model th=
in) are the most beautiful. Thus is there also a relationship between healt=
h, beauty, and sex. If beauty can thus be equated to health, we can see tha=
t beauty is again equated to the holy. And we can see too that sex in-and-o=
f-itself is and cannot be unholy, as it is connected (but not equivalent) t=
o beauty. =0A=0AA holy world is a whole world. It is a healthy world. It is=
 a good and just world. It is a complex world. It is a world of individuals=
 in community. It is a beautiful world. But is it a possible world? I have =
already given the answer: the world is itself already holy. We just have to=
 learn to see it as holy. That is how we will heal the world. And, as we do=
, we will become less and less likely to want or try to eliminate those who=
 disagree with us =96 until we are all in agreement on this one issue, as a=
ll the cells in an organism are in agreement on the one issue that they mus=
t work together for the health of the whole, even as each performs its own =
function. Thus, the world will become more and more holy in our eyes. In wo=
rks of tragedy, nomos (convention, human law, naming; from which we get the=
 words nomad and nomenclature, and which is the changing and changeable asp=
ect of the world) comes into conflict with physis (or nature; from which we=
 get the
 word physics). That is the position we are now in. When we get nomos to ma=
p onto physis (Heraclitus calls this conjunction logos =96 which can be tra=
nslated as saying, speech, discourse, word, account, explanation, reason, p=
rinciple, collection, enumeration, ratio, proportion), we will see the worl=
d as it truly is: holy.=0A=0AOn the Holy=0A=0AWhere lies the holy in the mo=
dern world?=0AIt lies in Blake=92s world in a grain of sand =96=0AIt lies, =
and lies like the truth, in patterns=0ALike self-organized rings of rocks b=
arren=0AArctic fields create. It lies in the branch=0AOf every tree and spe=
cies, leafing out=0AFrom the known into the unknown. It lies=0AIn every son=
g, painting and rhythmic verse.=0AWe have looked at every leaf and petal,=
=0AAt the bark and at the wood, every cell=0AAnd strand of DNA is now known=
 =96=0AAnd we have forgotten that all of this=0AWas once a tree that gave u=

of sand against its roots to hold=0AThe ground in place, even as that groun=
d moves=0AAnd changes in tiny ways we refuse=0ATo see. In this we can see t=
he holy.=0AThis is where it lies, now and forever,=0AOn the edge of order a=

but you were the one crying shame! on the women of the Poetry Brothel! for
dressing like whores!

(please note that I am NOT arguing that prostitution is not a sexist
institution.  clearly it is.  and i agree that it is part of a complex of
normative heterosexuality that does terrible violence to all women.  But as
for the actual women who are living in actual slavery, i think complaining
about the symbolic degrading of womankind does nothing for them: it's like
trying to improve the safety of coal mines by complaining about climate
change.

And if you're just using those women (who are very real, and many of them
living in absolutely horrific situations, as you rightly pointed out) as
symbols of Degraded Womankind, you are doing a disservice to them and also
to the many many women (some of whom must be subscribers to this list) who
work in other parts of the sex trade -- exotic dancers, high-end call-girls,
dominatrices, nude housekeepers, pornographic models, hooters waitresses,
etc. -- some of these people are my friends and i take it personally -- and
I think that their own struggles for better working conditions are not
unrelated to the struggle against slavery in other parts of their bosses'
businesses...

-- but i'm sorry that i overreacted and became part of a litany of men (all
men!  really!  can it really be that there are no women here who work in the
sex trade??) who are all seemingly trying to justify the institution as an
institution.  I am not trying to justify it, just trying to defend my
friends who work there from the harsh judgments of their elders...

but I don't believe either considering it labor or shame on women is right.
in a free society women cd dress any way they wanted not just in ways
dictated by the society as sexy.

Amiri Baraka's essay, "Ed Dorn & The Western World," is now available
through Effing Press: http://effingpress.com/baraka.htm.

It is based on a talk Baraka gave in March 2008 during the Ed Dorn
Symposium, sponsored by the University of Colorado-Boulder. In the
essay he looks at how both men addressed ethnic division and the
consequences of race in their work. This is a substantial reflection
on the history of New American poetics. I encourage everyone to
purchase a copy today.

Thanks,

Dale

Well, I really hate to come out of lurkdom on the list with a response
to this discussion, but I think the following view is worth taking into
consideration while contemplating the topic at hand. I spoke to a friend
yesterday who was in "the business" for a couple years in NYC in the early
2000s, a friend whom I lived with during part of the time, and she wanted
to make it very clear that in many instances, she didn't have to perform
sexual activities with her clients, or that the sexual part was minimal,
a hand job or pissing in the client's mouth. There was an old boxing coach
who would call girls and teach them a few tricks and have them beat up on
him a bit. She said many of her Jewish clients would get girls simply to
spank them. Probably a demoralizing experience if your approach is one of
your flesh being violated, but her take on it was that, for the money, it
was no less demoralizing than frying burgers for minimum wage. Of course
there were many men, some of whom she found attractive and enjoyed
intercourse with, some of whom she didn't, in which case, she would keep
the encounter strictly business. She acknowledged the risks, but said she
would consider someone grossly ignorant and foolish to have entered the
profession and not have been aware of the risks and taken measures to
prevent any disasters. She always had a driver "tough guy" waiting
outside in case she didn't come out at the appointed time. This cut down
on her profits, but she felt the potential protection was worth it. She
got herself tested regularly and put a decent portion of the money away
as a nest egg. If she went on a call and "didn't feel right about it"
when she got there or if the guy had "obvious signs of disease" she would
call her driver immediately and leave. She also said that several of the
girls she worked with, including her sister, seemed to enjoy the work
more times than not, and that in some cases, it seemed boost their
confidence, strength of mind, and sense of independence. We didn't get
into the details of how and why. She did admit that it wasn't a job she
would want to work for very long, and said she got out of it mainly
because she'd grown tired of it, but she didn't regret having gone through
the experience and felt that, overall, much of how you felt about it was
dependent on the attitude you brought to it.

I'm not saying there aren't countless sex-related atrocities occurring
around the world daily...I spent a while investigating the situation in
Romania a couple years back and was rather disgusted to say the least,
but I think it's important to consider the subject from as many angles
as possible, including considering some of the more positive outcomes as
well.

Human Derivatives in Doug Holder=92s: The Man in the Booth in the Midtown=

Tunnel (Cervena Barva Press)=20

article by Michael Todd Steffen=20



The man in the booth in the Midtown Tunnel, not the title of a poem but i=
ts=20
subject, gives us, the passengers on the subway, a fleeting camera click =
of=20
glimpse of a man defined in his function. He is confined to an extreme ex=
ample=20
of a human reduced from nearly all that makes him human, precisely becaus=
e=20
of how the world today is structured, encountered and processed. He is li=
ke a=20
zoo animal. He paces the perimeter Of his cage, poet Doug Holder writes i=
n=20
lines reminiscent of Rainier Marie Rilke The Panther.=20



Holder typically takes these sorts of verbal photographs of people unusua=
lly=20
overridden by probably what is not a definitive moment for the people as =
they=20
really are, but by awkward vivid moments that would package them palatabl=
y=20
for our quick-take-for-thrills media consciousness. People confined to=20=

monotonous jobs of function in a tunnel booth or at a post office machine=
,=20
confined ridiculously for two years in a toilet, gotten up in colonial at=
tire,=20
apprehended at a maddened moment painting the statue of John Harvard red=20=

while tourists snap pictures.



The poet is snapping these photos partaking in the mania of his contempor=
ary=20
culture, and in doing so he is exercising a mimesis of the dynamics of 21=
st=20
century perception, how data about ourselves is created and presented to=20=

others. As though our experience today consisted of a rapid succession of=
=20
sudden images, spaced messages left, brief chats, sandwiches in wrappers =

e=20
next quirk or embarrassment to give cause to the perpetual laugh-track th=
at=20
must punctuate each moments joke, each segment of the day.



These are as serious implications as one would want to draw from a poet=20=

whose (can it be?) earnest intention is to humor us. Yet that Holder's=20=

perceptions are so keenly attuned to how the world works today gives an=20=

underlying substance to his seeming legerdemain, short poems of truncated=
=20
lines, almost epigrammatic,laconic, tongue-in-cheek, yet at the same time=
=20
oddly in the sympathetic spirit that Auden remembered in William Butler Y=
eats:=20



In a rapture of distress

Sing of human unsuccess.=20



And Doug Holder's disappointments succeed because, in partaking of the sw=
ift=20
momentum of today's mediatized mindset, he stubbornly entertains his=20
subjects as human in their dilemmas of being exposed. If the man in the b=
ooth=20
of the Midtown Tunnel appears caged to us, how must we appear to him?



Faceless and a blur,

Behind thick plates

Of light-bleached glass.



Poignantly from so little, Holder produces a rather profound insight, art=
iculated=20
with lyrical simplicity:=20

And we will

All remain

Ignorant of

Each other.=20



A danger the poet risks in tailoring verse to popular contemporary expect=

Sweden considers prostitution a form of Violence against Women.
Only the customer is prosecuted.

as for male prostitutes, the same rules apply.
the customer is held in contempt.

this, i suppose, would discourage pimps, brothels, et cetera.

I appreciate your writing, Richard, and adding some specificity to the
conversation. However, I doubt I will ever agree that all that you describe
is ok. In fact, it's awful for someone to be subjected to these things.
Imagine how tough she must have become to deal with all of this--covering up
her feelings, her sense of dignity. Not good for anyone.

twisting my words!
so writing about objections to prostitution does nothing, huh--so words
don't matter?
I think all those jobs are degrading.
I wd like to defend yr friends by getting them better jobs.
I am not criticizing these women.
Better working conditions wd be not having to succumb to male ideas of
sexuality in our culture, such narrow constraints.

It is no longer 'Eyeless in Gaza" - Israel's attempts to keep the media out=
 of Gaza notwithstanding, on the outside we have more than an absolutely aw=
ful 'Eyeful' now. Even from the standpoint of traditional Ghetto (Occupatio=
n) management standards, the carnage of Palestinians, plus buildings,=A0 in=
frastructure and homes is an absolute outrage and failure. In terms of Amer=
ican racial history, Gaza in many ways so much echos Kansas City, Watts, De=
troit and any number of other ghetto uprisings that have been mercilessly c=
aused and the repressions of which have been mercilessly executed.=A0=20

As Hitler & Company envisioned Jews as a permanent threat to some concept o=
f German purity, progress, etc., what does the Israeli leadership, such as =
it is, seek to eliminate in Gaza! =A0=20

Going back to the '60's in California=A0 I can remember racist Governor Ron=
ald Regan & company hearing and magnifying the 'threat'=A0 of separatist an=
d armed Black militants.=A0 Instead of figuring out ways to negotiate and d=
eal with the real issues inside ghetto communities, they responded in the=
=A0 same heavy handed paranoid manner that Israel's right wing is respondin=
g=A0 to Hamas - that is by demonizing and (now obviously)=A0 seeking their =
liquidation on all levels - institutional, cultural, etc. etc.=A0 As if thi=
s kind of punishment has ever been successful - short run, maybe yes, but l=
ong term most always a form of national self-poisoning. (i.e., witness the =
wonderful, self-destructing condition of the USA today! )=20

& all with the final 'last days' support of support of George Bush and Dick=
 Cheney - and all 'in our name'.=A0 =A0 Again.

Watch Israel withdraw from Gaza on the day before the Inauguration. Astonis=
hing (or not)=A0 what garbage these people are dumping into Obama's White H=
ouse the week before he moves in! Oy!

who's judging men & women for trying to get each others' attention?
there are an infinite number of ways of doing that, I suppose. I myself used
to be very good at it.
the best party I ever went to was given by a crazy gal doing
off-broadway--she brought her troupe to town & they brought their costumes &
put them all over the floor. every hour we had to change outfits. we cd
combine anything with anything. that was liberating.

Alice Notley has a poem which starts with the protagonist saying she a woman
in a whore house. I can not at this moment remember the title.

Thank you, Troy, for this rather detailed overview on  theology. There =
are a
couple of points with which I take exception.
Being a Buddhist/Taoist, I take exception to your use of the word =
'holy'. I
would much rather see the word 'spiritual' used as, in my mind, 'holy' =
is,
in fact, a divisive word - something which, in opposition to, is one of =
the
main themes of your expurgation.=20
Another is your discussion of Christianity. Unfortunately, in all things
verging on the spiritual, the original message of the originator is
corrupted once it gets into the hands of man. This is true even of =
Buddhism
where a religion was created where none was intended. The philosophy of
Buddhism and Taoism is intended to act on an individual basis although =
the
concept of the sangha may create confusion. However, when the sangha is
considered as a spiritual body there to support the individual in their
quest for nirvana (nirbbana), then the individual remains paramount.
Finally, your use of the  term 'postmodern'. If we accept Foucault's =
concept
of the rupture and his adoption of the terms 'epoch' as areas in which =
new
conceptions of old concepts has occurred, then 'modernism' is just an
extension, the dying breath, of romanticism. Therefore, the correct term
should be 'post-romantic'.
Just some random thoughts.
John Herbert Cunningham

Subject: On Health, Holiness, Beauty and Poetry

In English the words holy, whole, hale, and health are etymologically
connected =96 Old English halig, hal, and h=E6lth, respectively, which =
are all
related to hal. Thus are they conceptually connected. To see the world =
as
holy is to see the world as whole =96 it is to have the world =93appear =
infinite
and holy, whereas it now appears finite and corrupt=94 (William Blake, =
=93The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell=94). The word holistic comes from the Greek =
holos,
whole. Thus the holy is holistic =96 God is holy because He encompasses =
all.
Perhaps one could even say that we can recognize the divine only when we
come to see the world as a whole, when we see the universe as universal.
When we can come

To see a World in a grain of sand,
And a Heaven in a wild flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour. (William Blake, =93Auguries of Innocence=94)

Health and hale is the same. To have health is to have wholeness. To be =
hale
is to be healthy =96 whole and complete. To make healthy is to make =
whole
again. One is healed through medication. But ideally, one would rather
maintain one=92s health than have to withstand the ravages of medication
(pharmaceutical comes from the Greek pharmakon, which means both poison =
and
medicine =96 as it does today), though medication is necessary to stave =
off
disease. This is the purpose of Plato=92s Pharmakon, to stave off =
disease. For
disease is the opposite of health.

The Modern Era, which we are still in, though we may be at the end of =
it,
began when Descartes split man in two =96 body and soul. It was a =
necessary
division for the development of modern science (which Descartes all but
admits to =96 the division is so the Church will tend to the soul, while =
the
body is left alone, to be tended to by scientists such as Descartes), =
but it
was certainly an unholy division (as all divisions are, by definition). =
Kant
deepened this division. Hegel tried to mend it through philosophical
synthesis. Marx tried to mend it by recommending the overthrow of half =
of
the world =96 the world would then be wholly Proletarian. Nietzsche =
responded
to Hegel by dividing the world up even more =96 for him, humans are not
divided into body and soul, but are instead a series of masks. With
postmodernism, the division is complete: men and women, =
multiculturalism,
radical Cartesian individualism divide us up more and more. Any =
universality
is
 denied. A necessary development =96 and not without its truth (I am =
aware of
the irony of using the word truth, which comes from the Old English =
treowth,
related to the word troth, from which we get the word betrothed, to =
speak of
an idea that is more interested in divorce than betrothal). But it is
precisely as unholy as one can get.

The deep divisions fostered by postmodernism came about because of a =
view
that grand narratives, attempts to universalize, and seeing the world as
holistic created the problems of the 20th Century. The Marxist grand
narrative gave us the gulag of the Soviet Union, the massacres of the =
Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia, and any number of other slaughters done by =
governments
who had embraced Marxist philosophy. We looked back on history after the
Holocaust, saw the grand narrative of Christianity had in the past =
itself
promoted the killing of Jews =96 particularly in the Inquisition =96 and
concluded that it too was dangerous. One could also mention The Terror =
of
the French Revolution. What did Marxism, Medieval Christianity, and the
French Revolution have in common? One thing was that they were all grand
narratives. Thus, the logic goes, it must be grand narratives which are =
bad.
And what do grand narratives do? They see the world as a whole, which =
must
be
 encompassed by their ideology. To make the world a whole, it must be =
placed
under their one ideology. Thus, holistic world views were seen as bad =
=96 thus
were they, and holiness, rejected. The path to Heaven =96 whether that =
heaven
was celestial or earthly =96 seemed to lead us straight into Hell. =
Perhaps in
part the rejection of holding a holistic view came about because it is
related to the holy, and the holy has been rejected. To the extent that
wisdom is the ability to see the unity of the world =96 meaning wisdom =
is the
ability to see the world as holy =96 wisdom was also rejected as =
impossible,
perhaps even undesirable.

The error in this way of thinking derives from the error made in seeing
Communism, Christianity, or the ideals of the French Revolution as
interested in seeing the world as holistic. None of them saw the world =
as
holistic, as holy =96 they instead wanted to make the world whole, under =
their
particular umbrellas. They too fostered divisions =96 there were enemies =
who
had to be either converted or killed in order that the world could be =
made
holy. =93For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to =
leave
his guard at tree of life; and when he does, the whole creation will be
consumed and appear infinite and holy=94 (Blake =93The Marriage of =
Heaven and
Hell=94). Now Blake here uses the word =93appear.=94 None of them saw =
the world as
holy. It had to be made so =96 through conflagration, if necessary. =
Postmodern
thought, by dividing the world even more, does not help us to see the =
world
as holy =96 quite the contrary. However, by insisting on
 equality among the various parts =96 among individuals, among cultures, =
among
religions, among any number of groups of individuals =96 postmodern =
thought
may ironically make it now possible to see the world as being, rather =
than
needing to become, holy.

It may seem ironic to suggest that only by reaching the most severe of
divisions =96 seeing the world as eminently unholy =96 that we can =
finally come
to see that the world is in fact holy, but I am not being ironic. To see =
the
world as holy is not to see everything in the world as equal in an
egalitarian sense. There are hierarchies. To see the world as holy is to
understand how everything fits into the world as a whole. It is to see =
the
world as an immense organism, and to care for its health. An organism is
made up of systems, organs, tissues, cells, organelles, and various
biochemicals. For one group to want to envelop the entire world in one =
way
of thinking, believing, viewing the world, would be the same as one cell
wanting to envelop the entire organism in that one type of cell. We have =
a
word for cells that want to do that: cancer. The postmodernists have
mistaken viewing the actions of cancerous cells for seeing the whole
organism. Cancer must
 be fought, not mistaken for the animal it is in. That is the only way =
one
can have a healthy organism =96 and it is the only way to have a holy =
world..
Like a healthy organism, a holy world is complex. Like a healthy =
organism, a
holy world has smoothly working parts in communication with each other
through clear rules that proscribe what each part needs to do for the =
whole
to work well. Like a healthy organism, this cannot come from any =
centralized
authority =96 there is no one control cell in the body, and the brain =
must
have the lungs just as much as the lungs must have the brain. A holy =
world
is like a healthy organism.

In Negative Theology, one comes to know what God is by figuring out what =
God
is not. Aristotle says that if you are not sure if something is good, =
try to
figure out what is bad, and you can then deduce that what is good is its
opposite.=20
The following are unhealthy:

1. Overeating, including eating a high percentage of foods with low
nutritional value, while remaining inactive (not exercising)
2. Either stagnation or change without continuity =96 both create =
instability
3. Stress and anxiety =96 which comes about from not realizing that =
there are
parts of the world that one cannot control, and can lead to anger at =
those
very things
4. Hatred =96 aside from raising the blood pressure, it can cause one to =
act
in ways that would be unhealthy for the object of our hatred
5. Cancer =96 already discussed
6. Excess =96 including the excess of moderation
7. Shackles =96 prevents sufficient movement, equating to lack of =
exercise
8. Pollution =96 it can lead to any number of diseases
9. An overly-clean environment =96 it can prevent our immune systems =
from
developing properly, making us more susceptible to diseases, especially
autoimmune diseases
10. Suicide =96 inherently and obviously unhealthy
11. Isolation =96 loneliness can lead to depression, which depresses the
immune system=20
12. Ignorance =96 either of the world or of oneself, as one cannot =
maintain
one=92s health if one is ignorant of what can harm it or improve it

This leads one to posit the following are healthy:

1. Exercise, with a diet proper to the amount of exercise and of high
nutritional value
2. Change with continuity
3. Realizing that there are parts of the world that one cannot control, =
thus
reducing stress and anxiety
4. Love
5. Keeping the body in hierarchical harmony
6. Moderation in everything, including moderation =96 remembering that
moderation is an extreme in the same way that life is an extreme state =
of
organic chemistry
7. Freedom =96 remembering that freedom does not equate to a lack of =
rules,
but is rather what is achieved through playing by the best rules
8. Cleanliness (which, as the saying goes, is next to Godliness, meaning =
it
is holy)
9. A non-sanitized world =96 a world without dirt is a world that makes
unhealthy organisms
10. Love of one=92s own life
11. Friends
12. Knowledge =96 including self-knowledge

One can make a similar list of what makes for a healthy mind:
1. Taking in healthy information =96 good art, music, literature, =
philosophy,
the sciences, etc. =96 with sufficient exercise of the mind through =
thought,
discussion, and writing
2. Change with continuity
3.. Realizing that there are parts of the world that one cannot control,
thus reducing stress and anxiety, which can negatively affect the mind =
as
well as the body
4. Love
5. Having a variety of inputs =96 obsession with one thing alone is a =
kind of
mental cancer
6. Moderation in everything, including moderation =96 moderation of =
reading,
of rigorous thought, sexual thoughts, work, play, physical activity, =
etc.
7. Freedom of thought =96 we must not think in shackles, but with =
flexible
rules
8. Cleanliness of thought =96 this does not necessarily mean what it has
traditionally meant in the West, though it can certainly contain some
elements; thinking about sex is in and of itself not unclean
9. Realization that we do not and cannot live in a sanitized world, as =
that
stops thought and creativity
10. Love of thinking
11. Friends =96 as Aristotle says in Rhetoric, =93a wide circle of =
friends, a
virtuous circle of friends,=94 and, I would add, a mentally stimulating =
circle
of friends
12. Knowledge =96 including self knowledge =96 with the goal of wisdom

A holy world is one that parallels the healthy body and the healthy =
mind,
and will have the above qualities, including moderation in everything,
including moderation (i.e., it will be a just world), freedom (this is
freedom from, not freedom to), love, friendship, and beauty. A holy =
world is
a beautiful world, both having variety in unity, unity in variety,
complexity, and fluid hierarchy that is self-similar regardless of =
scale.
All of the parts, living in love and friendship (which does not exclude
healthy competition, such as we find in sports and in free trade), =
living in
a complex dynamic with each other, living as individuals in various
communities, many of which overlap and are nested within other =
communities,
must be self-similar to have a holy world.

In Greek, to kalon means the beautiful, but it can also mean the =
honorable
or the noble =96 and kala can mean either things that are beautiful or =
things
that are morally good. In the Rhetoric, Aristotle says that =93Now kalon
describes whatever, through being chosen for itself, is praiseworthy or
whatever, through being good [agathon], is pleasant because it is good
[agathon]. If this, then, is the kalon, then virtue is necessarily =
kalon;
for it is praiseworthy because of being good [agathon]=94 (79). Elaine =
Scarry
points out that in English too, there is a connection between beauty and =
the
good (the just), when she points out that to say that something is fair =
is
to say that it is either beautiful or that it is just. In Greek and in
English, the beautiful and the good are connected. If a holy world is a
beautiful world, it is a good and just world as well. As Heraclitus =
said,
=93For god all things are fair and just, but men have taken some things =
as
 unjust, others as just=94 (LXVIII). The key here is that we see the =
world
itself as just =96 not the actions of each and every individual. The =
world is
itself justified and cannot itself be unjust. This is consistent with =
the
teachings of any religion that sees the world as having been created by =
God
or the gods =96 how could a fair and just god create a world that was =
itself
unjust? And if theistic religions are rejected, how can the world itself
possibly be unjust? To say it is unjust is to give it anthropomorphic
qualities. It is people who have taken some things as being just, others =
as
unjust =96 but the world itself is self-justified. Those who do not see =
the
world as just are those who do not see the world as holy =96 often they =
are
the same people who think the only way the world can be justified is if =
the
world is made holy through the transformation of it into a perfect =
mirror of
themselves. But we have seen that a world made up of only one
 world view is a cancerous world =96 and the world, as a cancerous =
organism,
will die. An organism cannot consist of one type of cell =96 that is the
unhealthiest of organisms. And a world having only one world view is the
unhealthiest of worlds. In the same way that a healthy body consists of =
a
variety of cells that are variations of the same theme coded by =
identical
DNA, a healthy world consists of a variety of peoples that are =
variations of
the same themes coded for by our being human and sharing the same =
cultural
universals.=20

Beauty is also related to health =96 as we can see in the beauty we find =
in
nature. Healthy plants produce the most beautiful flowers. Healthy =
peacocks
produce the largest, most symmetrical, most colorful feathers. Healthy
gobies and other territorial reef fish have the brightest colors. All of
this natural beauty is the advertisement of health to the opposite sex. =
The
healthiest human bodies (neither overweight nor super model thin) are =
the
most beautiful. Thus is there also a relationship between health, =
beauty,
and sex. If beauty can thus be equated to health, we can see that beauty =
is
again equated to the holy. And we can see too that sex in-and-of-itself =
is
and cannot be unholy, as it is connected (but not equivalent) to beauty. =


A holy world is a whole world. It is a healthy world. It is a good and =
just
world. It is a complex world. It is a world of individuals in community. =
It
is a beautiful world. But is it a possible world? I have already given =
the
answer: the world is itself already holy. We just have to learn to see =
it as
holy. That is how we will heal the world. And, as we do, we will become =
less
and less likely to want or try to eliminate those who disagree with us =
=96
until we are all in agreement on this one issue, as all the cells in an
organism are in agreement on the one issue that they must work together =
for
the health of the whole, even as each performs its own function. Thus, =
the
world will become more and more holy in our eyes. In works of tragedy, =
nomos
(convention, human law, naming; from which we get the words nomad and
nomenclature, and which is the changing and changeable aspect of the =
world)
comes into conflict with physis (or nature; from which we get the
 word physics). That is the position we are now in. When we get nomos to =
map
onto physis (Heraclitus calls this conjunction logos =96 which can be
translated as saying, speech, discourse, word, account, explanation, =
reason,
principle, collection, enumeration, ratio, proportion), we will see the
world as it truly is: holy.

On the Holy

Where lies the holy in the modern world?
It lies in Blake=92s world in a grain of sand =96
It lies, and lies like the truth, in patterns
Like self-organized rings of rocks barren
Arctic fields create. It lies in the branch
Of every tree and species, leafing out
From the known into the unknown. It lies
In every song, painting and rhythmic verse.
We have looked at every leaf and petal,
At the bark and at the wood, every cell
And strand of DNA is now known =96
And we have forgotten that all of this
Was once a tree that gave us shade and filled
The air with delicate sweetness and held
The grains of sand against its roots to hold
The ground in place, even as that ground moves
And changes in tiny ways we refuse
To see. In this we can see the holy.
This is where it lies, now and forever,
On the edge of order and wild chaos,
Where the infinite holds in the finite,
Where we, ourselves holy, have always lived.

It's not all roses though - as far as I know this has caused alot of
problems - i.e. as the prostitute is no longer a criminal, but still a part
of the "game", she or he becomes a threat to the rest of the players, as sh=
e
or he can at any time run to the police, snitch on everyone and get off
scott-free - and in the underground world threats tend to become
neutralized: i.e. prostitution in Sweden has a tendency to be eastern
european women locked up in hotel rooms without any connection to the
outside world (as in the Lukas Moodyson film, Lilja 4ever). Which is not a
good thing.=20

And as far as I know, it's not only the customer but also the pimp or agent
or any third party which stands to benefit from the prostitution.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS:
"Spiraled Connections"
40 Years of Indigenous Journeys at UCLA

The American Indian Studies Center is seeking poetry submissions for a
fortieth-anniversary anthology commem=ACorating its forty years of
publishing books by and about Native peoples. We envision this anthology
as a collection of materials by Indigenous poets directly connected to
UCLA in the past forty years and those they have mentored or
influ=ACenced. Our aim is to illustrate and celebrate the ways that
Native people present at the core of the American Indian educational
movement have radiated their innovation and empowerment out to the
community in all directions. Submissions do not have to be
education-oriented.

Deadline: February 1, 2009

WHO CAN SUBMIT: Indigenous poets (having origin in any of the original
peoples of North America and who maintain cultural identification
through tribal affiliation or community recognition) connected in some
way to UCLA (alumni, former/current
professor/undergraduate/graduate/staff, folks previously published in
AICRJ or other American Indian Studies Center publications) and those
they have mentored or influenced.

WHAT TO SUBMIT: Up to five poems (single spaced), not to exceed a total
of ten typed pages. We are open to all poetic styles and forms. Poems in
your Indigenous language will be considered but you must also provide
English translation with your submission. What have we become in these
past forty years of American Indian scholarship, education, community,
intellectual, creative and academic adventure? Who have we become, who
have we touched, how have we grown, transformed, helped each other,
learned to negotiate the academy, our multiple roles and lives? How can
we, as poets, express this Indigenous journey?

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES: Please include name, email, phone, address, and a
brief bio along with your submis=ACsions. While unpublished pieces are
preferred, previously published material will be considered. If
something has been previously published, please let us know where and
when it was published, and whether you have the rights to your own
material.

HOW TO SUBMIT: Inquiries can be directed to Deborah Miranda:
mirandad@wlu.edu. Deadline: February 1, 2009. Please send submissions
with an SASE for response to:

apologies: i have no control over the cheese slider:
http://research.microsoft.com/songsmith

sing into a microphone or play an instrument into it and this product of
microsoft research apparently helps you create a song from it.

i haven't tried it out yet myself. just watched the video and read some
propaganda.

to judge from the video, 'the future looks dreadful'. the actual music in
the promo video truly is dreadful. just dreadful.

but the concept is kind of interesting.

but they should tone it down on the cheese slider.

or is it made of cheese? is it cheese all over it like ugly on an ape? or is
it more a matter of what is easy? cheese is relatively easy, isn't it, which
is part of what we object to in its cheesiness: it's predictable, easily
automated style.

ja?

ps: i've linked to it at http://vispo.com/misc/ia.htm , which is my page of
annotated links to works of interactive audio.

Adam! Ruth! Two of my dearest friends...it makes me feel terrible to see you

about. Let's all kick back in my living room with a mug of coco and listen

twisting my words!
so writing about objections to prostitution does nothing, huh--so words
don't matter?
I think all those jobs are degrading.
I wd like to defend yr friends by getting them better jobs.
I am not criticizing these women.
Better working conditions wd be not having to succumb to male ideas of
sexuality in our culture, such narrow constraints.

DeCapite published it himself, through his Sparkle Street Books, in 1998.



Harvey Pekar, reviewing the book for the *Austin Chronicle**,* called it
"one of the best American novels of the last several years." *Rain Taxi* ra=

story "Sitting Pretty" was published as a *CUZ* Edition in 1999, and

2003. In 2003 and 2004, he wrote a monthly personal-observation column for =

The spiritual and the holy are two very different things. One can be spirit=
ual without being holy. One can also be religious without being holy, which=
 is of course the entire point of the essay. An understanding of the world =
that unified the thought of Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism (I'm more than a=
 bit of a Taoist myself), Islam, Hinduism, Shintoism, etc. would be an unde=
rstanding of the world as holy. I thus seek to recover the word "holy" from=
 the unholy ones who have highjacked the term. =0A=0AI do agree with you th=
at postmodernism is in fact in most ways post-romanticism. Frederick Turner=
 suggests that the "post" of postmodern is shorthand for "postscript" -- as=
 indeed I think it is in many ways. It is certainly anti-Enlightenment, and=
 thus is in many ways Romantic, and even more so, Rousseauean. Indeed, the =
postmodernists are all disciples of Rousseau -- but so are the Marxists, th=
e fascists, and other egalitarianist thinkers. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=

Foucault's concept=0Aof the rupture and his adoption of the terms 'epoch' a=
s areas in which new=0Aconceptions of old concepts has occurred, then 'mode=
rnism' is just an=0Aextension, the dying breath, of romanticism. Therefore,=
 the correct term=0Ashould be 'post-romantic'.=0AJust some random thoughts.=

=0ASubject: On Health, Holiness, Beauty and Poetry=0A=0AIn English the word=
s holy, whole, hale, and health are etymologically=0Aconnected =96 Old Engl=
ish halig, hal, and h=E6lth, respectively, which are all=0Arelated to hal. =
Thus are they conceptually connected. To see the world as=0Aholy is to see =
the world as whole =96 it is to have the world =93appear infinite=0Aand hol=
y, whereas it now appears finite and corrupt=94 (William Blake, =93The=0AMa=
rriage of Heaven and Hell=94). The word holistic comes from the Greek holos=
,=0Awhole. Thus the holy is holistic =96 God is holy because He encompasses=
 all.=0APerhaps one could even say that we can recognize the divine only wh=
en we=0Acome to see the world as a whole, when we see the universe as unive=
rsal.=0AWhen we can come=0A=0ATo see a World in a grain of sand,=0AAnd a He=
aven in a wild flower,=0AHold Infinity in the palm of your hand,=0AAnd Eter=
nity in an hour. (William Blake, =93Auguries of Innocence=94)=0A=0AHealth a=
nd hale is the same. To have health is to have wholeness. To be hale=0Ais t=
o be healthy =96 whole and complete. To make healthy is to make whole=0Aaga=
in. One is healed through medication. But ideally, one would rather=0Amaint=
ain one=92s health than have to withstand the ravages of medication=0A(phar=
maceutical comes from the Greek pharmakon, which means both poison and=0Ame=
dicine =96 as it does today), though medication is necessary to stave off=
=0Adisease. This is the purpose of Plato=92s Pharmakon, to stave off diseas=
e. For=0Adisease is the opposite of health.=0A=0AThe Modern Era, which we a=
re still in, though we may be at the end of it,=0Abegan when Descartes spli=
t man in two =96 body and soul. It was a necessary=0Adivision for the devel=
opment of modern science (which Descartes all but=0Aadmits to =96 the divis=
ion is so the Church will tend to the soul, while the=0Abody is left alone,=
 to be tended to by scientists such as Descartes), but it=0Awas certainly a=
n unholy division (as all divisions are, by definition). Kant=0Adeepened th=
is division. Hegel tried to mend it through philosophical=0Asynthesis. Marx=
 tried to mend it by recommending the overthrow of half of=0Athe world =96 =
the world would then be wholly Proletarian. Nietzsche responded=0Ato Hegel =
by dividing the world up even more =96 for him, humans are not=0Adivided in=
to body and soul, but are instead a series of masks. With=0Apostmodernism, =
the division is complete: men and women, multiculturalism,=0Aradical Cartes=
ian individualism divide us up more and more. Any universality=0Ais=0Adenie=
d. A necessary development =96 and not without its truth (I am aware of=0At=
he irony of using the word truth, which comes from the Old English treowth,=
=0Arelated to the word troth, from which we get the word betrothed, to spea=
k of=0Aan idea that is more interested in divorce than betrothal). But it i=
s=0Aprecisely as unholy as one can get.=0A=0AThe deep divisions fostered by=
 postmodernism came about because of a view=0Athat grand narratives, attemp=
ts to universalize, and seeing the world as=0Aholistic created the problems=
 of the 20th Century. The Marxist grand=0Anarrative gave us the gulag of th=
e Soviet Union, the massacres of the Khmer=0ARouge in Cambodia, and any num=
ber of other slaughters done by governments=0Awho had embraced Marxist phil=
osophy. We looked back on history after the=0AHolocaust, saw the grand narr=
ative of Christianity had in the past itself=0Apromoted the killing of Jews=
 =96 particularly in the Inquisition =96 and=0Aconcluded that it too was da=
ngerous. One could also mention The Terror of=0Athe French Revolution. What=
 did Marxism, Medieval Christianity, and the=0AFrench Revolution have in co=
mmon? One thing was that they were all grand=0Anarratives. Thus, the logic =
goes, it must be grand narratives which are bad.=0AAnd what do grand narrat=
ives do? They see the world as a whole, which must=0Abe=0Aencompassed by th=
eir ideology. To make the world a whole, it must be placed=0Aunder their on=
e ideology. Thus, holistic world views were seen as bad =96 thus=0Awere the=
y, and holiness, rejected. The path to Heaven =96 whether that heaven=0Awas=
 celestial or earthly =96 seemed to lead us straight into Hell. Perhaps in=
=0Apart the rejection of holding a holistic view came about because it is=
=0Arelated to the holy, and the holy has been rejected. To the extent that=
=0Awisdom is the ability to see the unity of the world =96 meaning wisdom i=
s the=0Aability to see the world as holy =96 wisdom was also rejected as im=
possible,=0Aperhaps even undesirable.=0A=0AThe error in this way of thinkin=
g derives from the error made in seeing=0ACommunism, Christianity, or the i=
deals of the French Revolution as=0Ainterested in seeing the world as holis=
tic. None of them saw the world as=0Aholistic, as holy =96 they instead wan=
ted to make the world whole, under their=0Aparticular umbrellas. They too f=
ostered divisions =96 there were enemies who=0Ahad to be either converted o=
r killed in order that the world could be made=0Aholy. =93For the cherub wi=
th his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave=0Ahis guard at tree of li=
fe; and when he does, the whole creation will be=0Aconsumed and appear infi=
nite and holy=94 (Blake =93The Marriage of Heaven and=0AHell=94). Now Blake=
 here uses the word =93appear.=94 None of them saw the world as=0Aholy. It =
had to be made so =96 through conflagration, if necessary. Postmodern=0Atho=
ught, by dividing the world even more, does not help us to see the world=0A=
as holy =96 quite the contrary. However, by insisting on=0Aequality among t=
he various parts =96 among individuals, among cultures, among=0Areligions, =
among any number of groups of individuals =96 postmodern thought=0Amay iron=
ically make it now possible to see the world as being, rather than=0Aneedin=
g to become, holy.=0A=0AIt may seem ironic to suggest that only by reaching=
 the most severe of=0Adivisions =96 seeing the world as eminently unholy =
=96 that we can finally come=0Ato see that the world is in fact holy, but I=
 am not being ironic. To see the=0Aworld as holy is not to see everything i=
n the world as equal in an=0Aegalitarian sense. There are hierarchies. To s=
ee the world as holy is to=0Aunderstand how everything fits into the world =
as a whole. It is to see the=0Aworld as an immense organism, and to care fo=
r its health. An organism is=0Amade up of systems, organs, tissues, cells, =
organelles, and various=0Abiochemicals. For one group to want to envelop th=
e entire world in one way=0Aof thinking, believing, viewing the world, woul=
d be the same as one cell=0Awanting to envelop the entire organism in that =
one type of cell. We have a=0Aword for cells that want to do that: cancer. =
The postmodernists have=0Amistaken viewing the actions of cancerous cells f=
or seeing the whole=0Aorganism. Cancer must=0Abe fought, not mistaken for t=
he animal it is in. That is the only way one=0Acan have a healthy organism =
=96 and it is the only way to have a holy world..=0ALike a healthy organism=
, a holy world is complex. Like a healthy organism, a=0Aholy world has smoo=
thly working parts in communication with each other=0Athrough clear rules t=
hat proscribe what each part needs to do for the whole=0Ato work well. Like=
 a healthy organism, this cannot come from any centralized=0Aauthority =96 =
there is no one control cell in the body, and the brain must=0Ahave the lun=
gs just as much as the lungs must have the brain. A holy world=0Ais like a =
healthy organism.=0A=0AIn Negative Theology, one comes to know what God is =
by figuring out what God=0Ais not. Aristotle says that if you are not sure =
if something is good, try to=0Afigure out what is bad, and you can then ded=
uce that what is good is its=0Aopposite. =0AThe following are unhealthy:=0A=
=0A1. Overeating, including eating a high percentage of foods with low=0Anu=
tritional value, while remaining inactive (not exercising)=0A2. Either stag=
nation or change without continuity =96 both create instability=0A3. Stress=
 and anxiety =96 which comes about from not realizing that there are=0Apart=
s of the world that one cannot control, and can lead to anger at those=0Ave=
ry things=0A4. Hatred =96 aside from raising the blood pressure, it can cau=
se one to act=0Ain ways that would be unhealthy for the object of our hatre=
d=0A5. Cancer =96 already discussed=0A6. Excess =96 including the excess of=
 moderation=0A7. Shackles =96 prevents sufficient movement, equating to lac=
k of exercise=0A8. Pollution =96 it can lead to any number of diseases=0A9.=
 An overly-clean environment =96 it can prevent our immune systems from=0Ad=
eveloping properly, making us more susceptible to diseases, especially=0Aau=
toimmune diseases=0A10. Suicide =96 inherently and obviously unhealthy=0A11=
.. Isolation =96 loneliness can lead to depression, which depresses the=0Aim=
mune system =0A12. Ignorance =96 either of the world or of oneself, as one =
cannot maintain=0Aone=92s health if one is ignorant of what can harm it or =
improve it=0A=0AThis leads one to posit the following are healthy:=0A=0A1. =
Exercise, with a diet proper to the amount of exercise and of high=0Anutrit=
ional value=0A2. Change with continuity=0A3. Realizing that there are parts=
 of the world that one cannot control, thus=0Areducing stress and anxiety=
=0A4. Love=0A5. Keeping the body in hierarchical harmony=0A6. Moderation in=
 everything, including moderation =96 remembering that=0Amoderation is an e=
xtreme in the same way that life is an extreme state of=0Aorganic chemistry=
=0A7. Freedom =96 remembering that freedom does not equate to a lack of rul=
es,=0Abut is rather what is achieved through playing by the best rules=0A8.=
 Cleanliness (which, as the saying goes, is next to Godliness, meaning it=
=0Ais holy)=0A9. A non-sanitized world =96 a world without dirt is a world =
that makes=0Aunhealthy organisms=0A10. Love of one=92s own life=0A11. Frien=
ds=0A12. Knowledge =96 including self-knowledge=0A=0AOne can make a similar=
 list of what makes for a healthy mind:=0A1. Taking in healthy information =
=96 good art, music, literature, philosophy,=0Athe sciences, etc. =96 with =
sufficient exercise of the mind through thought,=0Adiscussion, and writing=
=0A2. Change with continuity=0A3.. Realizing that there are parts of the wo=
rld that one cannot control,=0Athus reducing stress and anxiety, which can =
negatively affect the mind as=0Awell as the body=0A4. Love=0A5. Having a va=
riety of inputs =96 obsession with one thing alone is a kind of=0Amental ca=
ncer=0A6. Moderation in everything, including moderation =96 moderation of =
reading,=0Aof rigorous thought, sexual thoughts, work, play, physical activ=
ity, etc.=0A7. Freedom of thought =96 we must not think in shackles, but wi=
th flexible=0Arules=0A8. Cleanliness of thought =96 this does not necessari=
ly mean what it has=0Atraditionally meant in the West, though it can certai=
nly contain some=0Aelements; thinking about sex is in and of itself not unc=
lean=0A9. Realization that we do not and cannot live in a sanitized world, =
as that=0Astops thought and creativity=0A10. Love of thinking=0A11. Friends=
 =96 as Aristotle says in Rhetoric, =93a wide circle of friends, a=0Avirtuo=
us circle of friends,=94 and, I would add, a mentally stimulating circle=0A=
of friends=0A12. Knowledge =96 including self knowledge =96 with the goal o=
f wisdom=0A=0AA holy world is one that parallels the healthy body and the h=
ealthy mind,=0Aand will have the above qualities, including moderation in e=
verything,=0Aincluding moderation (i.e., it will be a just world), freedom =
(this is=0Afreedom from, not freedom to), love, friendship, and beauty. A h=
oly world is=0Aa beautiful world, both having variety in unity, unity in va=
riety,=0Acomplexity, and fluid hierarchy that is self-similar regardless of=
 scale.=0AAll of the parts, living in love and friendship (which does not e=
xclude=0Ahealthy competition, such as we find in sports and in free trade),=
 living in=0Aa complex dynamic with each other, living as individuals in va=
rious=0Acommunities, many of which overlap and are nested within other comm=
unities,=0Amust be self-similar to have a holy world.=0A=0AIn Greek, to kal=
on means the beautiful, but it can also mean the honorable=0Aor the noble =
=96 and kala can mean either things that are beautiful or things=0Athat are=
 morally good. In the Rhetoric, Aristotle says that =93Now kalon=0Adescribe=
s whatever, through being chosen for itself, is praiseworthy or=0Awhatever,=
 through being good [agathon], is pleasant because it is good=0A[agathon]. =
If this, then, is the kalon, then virtue is necessarily kalon;=0Afor it is =
praiseworthy because of being good [agathon]=94 (79). Elaine Scarry=0Apoint=
s out that in English too, there is a connection between beauty and the=0Ag=
ood (the just), when she points out that to say that something is fair is=
=0Ato say that it is either beautiful or that it is just. In Greek and in=
=0AEnglish, the beautiful and the good are connected. If a holy world is a=
=0Abeautiful world, it is a good and just world as well. As Heraclitus said=
,=0A=93For god all things are fair and just, but men have taken some things=
 as=0Aunjust, others as just=94 (LXVIII). The key here is that we see the w=
orld=0Aitself as just =96 not the actions of each and every individual. The=
 world is=0Aitself justified and cannot itself be unjust. This is consisten=
t with the=0Ateachings of any religion that sees the world as having been c=
reated by God=0Aor the gods =96 how could a fair and just god create a worl=
d that was itself=0Aunjust? And if theistic religions are rejected, how can=
 the world itself=0Apossibly be unjust? To say it is unjust is to give it a=
nthropomorphic=0Aqualities. It is people who have taken some things as bein=
g just, others as=0Aunjust =96 but the world itself is self-justified. Thos=
e who do not see the=0Aworld as just are those who do not see the world as =
holy =96 often they are=0Athe same people who think the only way the world =
can be justified is if the=0Aworld is made holy through the transformation =
of it into a perfect mirror of=0Athemselves. But we have seen that a world =
made up of only one=0Aworld view is a cancerous world =96 and the world, as=
 a cancerous organism,=0Awill die. An organism cannot consist of one type o=
f cell =96 that is the=0Aunhealthiest of organisms. And a world having only=
 one world view is the=0Aunhealthiest of worlds. In the same way that a hea=
lthy body consists of a=0Avariety of cells that are variations of the same =
theme coded by identical=0ADNA, a healthy world consists of a variety of pe=
oples that are variations of=0Athe same themes coded for by our being human=
 and sharing the same cultural=0Auniversals. =0A=0ABeauty is also related t=
o health =96 as we can see in the beauty we find in=0Anature. Healthy plant=
s produce the most beautiful flowers. Healthy peacocks=0Aproduce the larges=
t, most symmetrical, most colorful feathers. Healthy=0Agobies and other ter=
ritorial reef fish have the brightest colors. All of=0Athis natural beauty =
is the advertisement of health to the opposite sex. The=0Ahealthiest human =
bodies (neither overweight nor super model thin) are the=0Amost beautiful. =
Thus is there also a relationship between health, beauty,=0Aand sex. If bea=
uty can thus be equated to health, we can see that beauty is=0Aagain equate=
d to the holy. And we can see too that sex in-and-of-itself is=0Aand cannot=
 be unholy, as it is connected (but not equivalent) to beauty. =0A=0AA holy=
 world is a whole world. It is a healthy world. It is a good and just=0Awor=
ld. It is a complex world. It is a world of individuals in community. It=0A=
is a beautiful world. But is it a possible world? I have already given the=
=0Aanswer: the world is itself already holy. We just have to learn to see i=
t as=0Aholy. That is how we will heal the world. And, as we do, we will bec=
ome less=0Aand less likely to want or try to eliminate those who disagree w=
ith us =96=0Auntil we are all in agreement on this one issue, as all the ce=
lls in an=0Aorganism are in agreement on the one issue that they must work =
together for=0Athe health of the whole, even as each performs its own funct=
ion. Thus, the=0Aworld will become more and more holy in our eyes. In works=
 of tragedy, nomos=0A(convention, human law, naming; from which we get the =
words nomad and=0Anomenclature, and which is the changing and changeable as=
pect of the world)=0Acomes into conflict with physis (or nature; from which=
 we get the=0Aword physics). That is the position we are now in. When we ge=
t nomos to map=0Aonto physis (Heraclitus calls this conjunction logos =96 w=
hich can be=0Atranslated as saying, speech, discourse, word, account, expla=
nation, reason,=0Aprinciple, collection, enumeration, ratio, proportion), w=
e will see the=0Aworld as it truly is: holy.=0A=0AOn the Holy=0A=0AWhere li=
es the holy in the modern world?=0AIt lies in Blake=92s world in a grain of=
 sand =96=0AIt lies, and lies like the truth, in patterns=0ALike self-organ=
ized rings of rocks barren=0AArctic fields create. It lies in the branch=0A=
Of every tree and species, leafing out=0AFrom the known into the unknown. I=
t lies=0AIn every song, painting and rhythmic verse.=0AWe have looked at ev=
ery leaf and petal,=0AAt the bark and at the wood, every cell=0AAnd strand =
of DNA is now known =96=0AAnd we have forgotten that all of this=0AWas once=
 a tree that gave us shade and filled=0AThe air with delicate sweetness and=
 held=0AThe grains of sand against its roots to hold=0AThe ground in place,=
 even as that ground moves=0AAnd changes in tiny ways we refuse=0ATo see. I=
n this we can see the holy.=0AThis is where it lies, now and forever,=0AOn =

Troy,

Isn't Rousseau in your worst hundred books in the world list? It is amazing
how you made snide, thought-starved attacks through iconic references a
second nature for yourself. In the negative sense you use the word
post-modern, you are the most post-modern of every one here.

Ciao,

Murat

Recently read Richard Louv's "Last Child In The Woods:Saving Our
Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder" (2005,2008) and he references
Wordsworth, and of course, Gary Snyder. And just this morning I found
this:

Can anyone suggest poets, critiques, etc. re: non-traditional nature poetry?

Troy,
I often disagree with you, but I can see a good deal of merit in your =20=

project here to reclaim the word holy.

The analytic philosopher in me (eminently modernist, don't you know) =20
wants a bit more rigor here though.

to that end i would consider the following pairings with the word =20
holy and holiness which I think maybe create some problems for what =20
you're saying and that I think need answering. Don't misunderstand =20
me, I think that there can be answers, I'm just curious about how the =20=

lines are drawn poetically and philosophically here.

first: holy vs. sacred

my own first among equals in the philosophical pantheon ludwig =20
wittgenstein has counseled that in most cases the meaning of a word =20
is it's use in a loanguage. To that end, we often use the word holy =20
in the same circumstance that we might also use the word sacred. =20
There is an overlap there just as there exists overlap between the =20
unholy and the profane. But the terms are not coextensive and =20
therefore not exact synonyms. I wonder what might be holy but not =20
sacred and in where the distinction lies.

second: holiness vs holism
there seems to be some blurring going on between the two words that =20
I'm not sure i understand. are you saying that holism is by =20
definition holy? how then do you account for competing views of =20
holines? you touched on this a bit in what's below and yr comments on =20=

metanarrative, but I'd like to see a more explicit development of =20
that thought, specifically given that the postmodern condition of =20
skepticism toward metanarratives (holiness in your view) is itself =20
holistic.

third: the holy vs the good

is all that is holy good? is all that is good holy? if so, why the =20
different words and wahat do we make of the different qualities =20
associated with each? holiness hasa connotation of unapproachability =20
and beyond the merely human, whereas goodness is something that we =20
can always seem ot find and appreciate. it is much like the aesthetic =20=

in this way.

=0A> Subject: On Health, Holiness, Beauty and Poetry=0A>=0A> In English the=
 words holy, whole, hale, and health are etymologically=0A> connected =96 O=
ld English halig, hal, and h=E6lth, respectively, which are all=0A> related=
 to hal. Thus are they conceptually connected. To see the world as=0A> holy=
 is to see the world as whole =96 it is to have the world "appear=0A> infin=
ite=0A> and holy, whereas it now appears finite and corrupt" (William Blake=
, "The=0A> Marriage of Heaven and Hell"). The word holistic comes from the =
Greek=0A> holos,=0A> whole. Thus the holy is holistic =96 God is holy becau=
se He encompasses all.=0A> Perhaps one could even say that we can recognize=
 the divine only when we=0A> come to see the world as a whole, when we see =
the universe as universal.=0A> When we can come=0A>=0A> To see a World in a=
 grain of sand,=0A> And a Heaven in a wild flower,=0A> Hold Infinity in the=
 palm of your hand,=0A> And Eternity in an hour. (William Blake, "Auguries =
of Innocence")=0A>=0A> Health and hale is the same. To have health is to ha=
ve wholeness. To be=0A> hale=0A> is to be healthy =96 whole and complete. T=
o make healthy is to make whole=0A> again. One is healed through medication=
.. But ideally, one would rather=0A> maintain one's health than have to with=
stand the ravages of medication=0A> (pharmaceutical comes from the Greek ph=
armakon, which means both poison and=0A> medicine =96 as it does today), th=
ough medication is necessary to stave off=0A> disease. This is the purpose =
of Plato's Pharmakon, to stave off disease.=0A> For=0A> disease is the oppo=
site of health.=0A>=0A> The Modern Era, which we are still in, though we ma=
y be at the end of it,=0A> began when Descartes split man in two =96 body a=
nd soul. It was a necessary=0A> division for the development of modern scie=
nce (which Descartes all but=0A> admits to =96 the division is so the Churc=
h will tend to the soul, while the=0A> body is left alone, to be tended to =
by scientists such as Descartes), but=0A> it=0A> was certainly an unholy di=
vision (as all divisions are, by definition).=0A> Kant=0A> deepened this di=
vision. Hegel tried to mend it through philosophical=0A> synthesis. Marx tr=
ied to mend it by recommending the overthrow of half of=0A> the world =96 t=
he world would then be wholly Proletarian. Nietzsche responded=0A> to Hegel=
 by dividing the world up even more =96 for him, humans are not=0A> divided=
 into body and soul, but are instead a series of masks. With=0A> postmodern=
ism, the division is complete: men and women, multiculturalism,=0A> radical=
 Cartesian individualism divide us up more and more. Any=0A> universality=
=0A> is=0A> denied. A necessary development =96 and not without its truth (=
I am aware of=0A> the irony of using the word truth, which comes from the O=
ld English=0A> treowth,=0A> related to the word troth, from which we get th=
e word betrothed, to speak=0A> of=0A> an idea that is more interested in di=
vorce than betrothal). But it is=0A> precisely as unholy as one can get.=0A=
>=0A> The deep divisions fostered by postmodernism came about because of a =
view=0A> that grand narratives, attempts to universalize, and seeing the wo=
rld as=0A> holistic created the problems of the 20th Century. The Marxist g=
rand=0A> narrative gave us the gulag of the Soviet Union, the massacres of =
the Khmer=0A> Rouge in Cambodia, and any number of other slaughters done by=
 governments=0A> who had embraced Marxist philosophy. We looked back on his=
tory after the=0A> Holocaust, saw the grand narrative of Christianity had i=
n the past itself=0A> promoted the killing of Jews =96 particularly in the =
Inquisition =96 and=0A> concluded that it too was dangerous. One could also=
 mention The Terror of=0A> the French Revolution. What did Marxism, Medieva=
l Christianity, and the=0A> French Revolution have in common? One thing was=
 that they were all grand=0A> narratives. Thus, the logic goes, it must be =
grand narratives which are=0A> bad.=0A> And what do grand narratives do? Th=
ey see the world as a whole, which must=0A> be=0A> encompassed by their ide=
ology. To make the world a whole, it must be placed=0A> under their one ide=
ology. Thus, holistic world views were seen as bad =96=0A> thus=0A> were th=
ey, and holiness, rejected. The path to Heaven =96 whether that heaven=0A> =
was celestial or earthly =96 seemed to lead us straight into Hell. Perhaps =
in=0A> part the rejection of holding a holistic view came about because it =
is=0A> related to the holy, and the holy has been rejected. To the extent t=

=96 they instead wanted to make the world whole, under=0A> their=0A> partic=

ivisions =96 seeing the world as eminently unholy =96 that we can finally c=
ome=0A> to see that the world is in fact holy, but I am not being ironic. T=
o see=0A> the=0A> world as holy is not to see everything in the world as eq=
ual in an=0A> egalitarian sense. There are hierarchies. To see the world as=
 holy is to=0A> understand how everything fits into the world as a whole. I=
t is to see the=0A> world as an immense organism, and to care for its healt=
h. An organism is=0A> made up of systems, organs, tissues, cells, organelle=

the same as one cell=0A> wanting to envelop the entire organism in that one=
 type of cell. We have a=0A> word for cells that want to do that: cancer. T=

wledge =96 with the goal of wisdom=0A>=0A> A holy world is one that paralle=

ties, including moderation in everything,=0A> including moderation (i.e., i=
t will be a just world), freedom (this is=0A> freedom from, not freedom to)=
, love, friendship, and beauty. A holy world=0A> is=0A> a beautiful world, =
both having variety in unity, unity in variety,=0A> complexity, and fluid h=
ierarchy that is self-similar regardless of scale.=0A> All of the parts, li=
ving in love and friendship (which does not exclude=0A> healthy competition=
, such as we find in sports and in free trade), living=0A> in=0A> a complex=
 dynamic with each other, living as individuals in various=0A> communities,=
 many of which overlap and are nested within other communities,=0A> must be=
 self-similar to have a holy world.=0A>=0A> In Greek, to kalon means the be=
autiful, but it can also mean the honorable=0A> or the noble =96 and kala c=
an mean either things that are beautiful or things=0A> that are morally goo=
d. In the Rhetoric, Aristotle says that "Now kalon=0A> describes whatever, =
through being chosen for itself, is praiseworthy or=0A> whatever, through b=
eing good [agathon], is pleasant because it is good=0A> [agathon]. If this,=
 then, is the kalon, then virtue is necessarily kalon;=0A> for it is praise=
worthy because of being good [agathon]" (79). Elaine Scarry=0A> points out =
that in English too, there is a connection between beauty and=0A> the=0A> g=
ood (the just), when she points out that to say that something is fair is=
=0A> to say that it is either beautiful or that it is just. In Greek and in=
=0A> English, the beautiful and the good are connected. If a holy world is =
a=0A> beautiful world, it is a good and just world as well. As Heraclitus s=
aid,=0A> "For god all things are fair and just, but men have taken some thi=
ngs as=0A> unjust, others as just" (LXVIII). The key here is that we see th=
e world=0A> itself as just =96 not the actions of each and every individual=
.. The world is=0A> itself justified and cannot itself be unjust. This is co=
nsistent with the=0A> teachings of any religion that sees the world as havi=
ng been created by God=0A> or the gods =96 how could a fair and just god cr=
eate a world that was itself=0A> unjust? And if theistic religions are reje=
cted, how can the world itself=0A> possibly be unjust? To say it is unjust =
is to give it anthropomorphic=0A> qualities. It is people who have taken so=
me things as being just, others as=0A> unjust =96 but the world itself is s=
elf-justified. Those who do not see the=0A> world as just are those who do =
not see the world as holy =96 often they are=0A> the same people who think =
the only way the world can be justified is if the=0A> world is made holy th=
rough the transformation of it into a perfect mirror=0A> of=0A> themselves.=
 But we have seen that a world made up of only one=0A> world view is a canc=
erous world =96 and the world, as a cancerous organism,=0A> will die. An or=
ganism cannot consist of one type of cell =96 that is the=0A> unhealthiest =
of organisms. And a world having only one world view is the=0A> unhealthies=
t of worlds. In the same way that a healthy body consists of a=0A> variety =
of cells that are variations of the same theme coded by identical=0A> DNA, =
a healthy world consists of a variety of peoples that are variations=0A> of=
=0A> the same themes coded for by our being human and sharing the same cult=
ural=0A> universals.=0A>=0A> Beauty is also related to health =96 as we can=
 see in the beauty we find in=0A> nature. Healthy plants produce the most b=
eautiful flowers. Healthy peacocks=0A> produce the largest, most symmetrica=
l, most colorful feathers. Healthy=0A> gobies and other territorial reef fi=
sh have the brightest colors. All of=0A> this natural beauty is the adverti=
sement of health to the opposite sex. The=0A> healthiest human bodies (neit=
her overweight nor super model thin) are the=0A> most beautiful. Thus is th=
ere also a relationship between health, beauty,=0A> and sex. If beauty can =
thus be equated to health, we can see that beauty is=0A> again equated to t=
he holy. And we can see too that sex in-and-of-itself is=0A> and cannot be =
unholy, as it is connected (but not equivalent) to beauty.=0A>=0A> A holy w=
orld is a whole world. It is a healthy world. It is a good and just=0A> wor=
ld. It is a complex world. It is a world of individuals in community. It=0A=
> is a beautiful world. But is it a possible world? I have already given th=
e=0A> answer: the world is itself already holy. We just have to learn to se=
e it=0A> as=0A> holy. That is how we will heal the world. And, as we do, we=
 will become=0A> less=0A> and less likely to want or try to eliminate those=
 who disagree with us =96=0A> until we are all in agreement on this one iss=
ue, as all the cells in an=0A> organism are in agreement on the one issue t=
hat they must work together for=0A> the health of the whole, even as each p=
erforms its own function. Thus, the=0A> world will become more and more hol=
y in our eyes. In works of tragedy,=0A> nomos=0A> (convention, human law, n=
aming; from which we get the words nomad and=0A> nomenclature, and which is=
 the changing and changeable aspect of the world)=0A> comes into conflict w=
ith physis (or nature; from which we get the=0A> word physics). That is the=
 position we are now in. When we get nomos to map=0A> onto physis (Heraclit=
us calls this conjunction logos =96 which can be=0A> translated as saying, =
speech, discourse, word, account, explanation,=0A> reason,=0A> principle, c=
ollection, enumeration, ratio, proportion), we will see the=0A> world as it=
 truly is: holy.=0A>=0A> On the Holy=0A>=0A> Where lies the holy in the mod=

 and lies like the truth, in patterns=0A> Like self-organized rings of rock=

I'd duggest James Galvin, esp. poems in Lethal Frequencies. Forrest Gander's
work might fit, too.

Juliana Spahr, for sure-- in some ways I think she's asking precisely this
question in her poetry.

I talk a bit about the possibility of a radical nature poetry in my review
of Ange Mlinko in the current Jacket---

broaden it out to "eco poetics / poetry" & also to poets who merely have the
natural world, landscape, plants, etc. as some of many subjects, and then
find oh, about a million poets

A lot of us draw our imagery and more from the apparently non-human
landscape, and it's where I'm happiest, but it's questionable if
there really is a non-human landscape. The woodlands next to my
apartment is usually described as "the last natural forest in
Manhattan." It's certainly a forest, and it's been managed hardly at
all for the past two centuries, but it contains plants that never
would have coexisted without post-conquest human presence. That
presence has become everywhere more intrusive, but one would have to
go back very far to find a landscape not radically altered by humans.
The Lenape who once inhabited my forest altered it by burning the
undergrowth to improve hunting. The great "virgin" forest that once
stretched to the Mississippi and beyond was managed as an enormous game park.

So I guess the first question might be, "what do you mean 'nature?'"
We generally mean an uncultivated plant and animal community, and in
some places a community in which we've allowed predators other than
ourselves to survive. It's our forebearance that more or less
preserves it, like a progressive zoo.

I've been following the discussion only sporadically=2C so please forgive a=
ny redundancy=2C but=2C the well-known "Effects of Prolonged Consumption of=
 Pornography" and other studies suggest that in places where pornography is=
 legal and increasingly popular there is a corresponding decrease in the in=
cidence of violent sexual crimes.  As if the medium could allow for the saf=
e channeling of certain repressed and thereby sinister desires.  However=2C=
 many observers attribute said decreased incidence to a greater leniency in=
 attitudes towards sexual behavior and an inability=2C or unwillingness=2C =
to interpret sex crimes as such.  In this regard=2C where pornography is wi=
dely consumed=2C we might note the evolution of more exotic and aggressive =
forms of it (think anus=2C gangbang=2C shit in the mouth). =20
=20
Though pornography and prostitution aren't the same thing=2C perhaps the sa=
me principle holds true.  The more the thing is permitted=2C the more borin=
g it gets=2C and so=2C the more deviant and illicit and forbidden its form =
must take.  Or in other terms=2C hunger (out of boredom) ensures the creati=
on (and delivery) of new products.  The more we're ok with prostitution=2C =
the more we're ok with whatever treatment the prostitute receives=2C and th=
e more novel treatments we'll surely find.  Let the free market rule.  Afte=
r all they're just a muscle.     =20

Last Friday there was a Hubert Huncke tribute for his 94th birthday (if h=
e were around to=20
celebrate) at Bowery Electric in N.Y.C.  Readers (of his work) *included*=
 Thurston Moore=20
from Sonic Youth (tall, rumpled, cool), Abel Ferrara (smart, not the best=
 reader, but who=20
cares -- a privilege to see him), Tatum O=92Neill (funny and utterly beau=
tiful but needs to=20
go to more open mics and learn to shout over instead of at the people at =
the bar). And=20
Patti Smith.  She stuck her gum=20

on the music stand.  She owned the stage.  She owned the house.  She brou=
ght the house=20
down,=20

as did David Lawton (open mic poet; actor), co-organizer of the event. He=
 was friends w/=20
Huncke and performed what I hope is the beginning of a one-man show.  I k=
now this is all

after the fact and I almost didn=92t go.  Lawton shamed me into going so =
I=92m doing some=20
thanking, here.  I don=92t want the evening to almost pass away without n=
otice and I don=92t=20
want Lawton to almost not consider=20

doing more.

Recently I've met a couple of young poets (yet again) who dropped out
of poetry writing workshops because they were, in the words of one of
these poets, "eaten alive."

The conversation isn't new.  And it's not a conversation about
workshops in particular, but competition in a bigger sense.

When is competition good, meaning productive, meaning THE THING which
spurs poets into action in the best sense, in the sense of WANTING to
write as well as they can.

And when is competition ugly, filled with envy and jealousy, reaching
a surprising number of times in my observations to the most corrupt,
wicked, disturbing places people can get to.

The conversation is tricky because I'm always trying to ask,
investigate with others, WHERE IS THE line between competition when
it's healthy, and rotten?

There's no doubt in my mind that these two young poets (the latest two
that is, as I've been having this conversation for years now and I
don't even remember how many times I've had it frankly) love, really
LOVE poetry.  We share that, we find when talking that we share that
DRIVE, depositing ourselves in front of bookstore poetry sections, and
libraries, and asking everyone we know who their favorite poets are,
and titles, and never getting enough of this love.  Never getting
enough of it.  And not just feeling sad when a bookstore like GOTHAM
BOOKMART closes down but ANGRY!

We're so much alike, and we tell one another what we're most excited
about NOW, and everyone's scratching notes for the library and
bookstore.  How we're NOT alike is that these two young poets are VERY
vulnerable to attack.  When they were said to be "eaten alive" I'm not
surprised.  And I'm sad, and wish they were MORE LIKE ME and laugh at
the bastards and say, "OH YOU'RE JUST A HATER, YOU JEALOUS PIG!"  Or,
"Yeah well, THANKS, being attacked GETS ME UP IN THE MORNING TO MAKE
YOU ANGRY!"  It feeds me when someone attacks me, I LOVE it.

But of course a lot of people don't respond well when they're
attacked, and this makes me sad.  I've known poets WHOSE POEMS MADE ME
HAPPY who stopped writing poems because of such attacks.  In some
cases the attacks were from their professors, and the other students,
egged-on by the professors.  A FEEDING FRENZY in such a way that makes
me want to puke for poetry.  It disgusts me this kind of behavior.

I'm not a professor, but I have conducted poetry workshops, and it's
NOT HARD AT ALL in my opinion to keep the focus about everyone
(including myself because I want to learn from THEM TOO!)
investigating poetry together!  My focus is about PROCESS, about the
many weird ways to MAKE poetry happen, NOT ABOUT who is writing poems
I think are good, or another person in the workshop thinks are good,
or not.

This is NOT goody-two-shoe bullshit, I'm JUST NOT INTERESTED in
telling someone whether I like their poems or not when I'm conducting
workshops.  And it's none of my business frankly.  But to LOVE poetry,
and read it, and create it, and have it in our lives, now THAT is
something I get very excited about!

But what is that line?  When is it crossed from productive and
beautiful and everyone's excited and MAKING poetry, to that place of
shit?

I'd rather see poems ABOUT that dark spot on the poetry map, than see
it overwhelm another poet.  And I mean overwhelm the poet who NEEDS to
be vicious, and of course I mean the poet who gets beaten down.

This conversation cannot happen unless we talk about the bigger things
around it, like, WHY IS EVERYONE NOT UNDERSTANDING EVERYONE IS
CREATIVE WE ARE ALL CREATIVE THIS IS NOT UP FOR DEBATE.  Or is it?
I've had people tell me this is wrong, that everyone's NOT creative.
But I disagree.

And the conversation needs to be about how the way poets act about
scarcity and fear that there's not enough NOT ENOUGH magazines NOT
ENOUGH awards or enough room at the reading series, not enough, is
really, such an old story about us being animals.

And the conversation needs to be about how to protect ourselves if we
can't withstand the attacks.

And the conversation needs to be about how people don't need to attack
others because THERE IS ENOUGH.

And the conversation needs to be about how art and all our creative
abilities have become part of a big system in the capital of art and
poetry, and books, and writing programs and teaching and, and, and
CONSUMPTION, and frankly how, more than ever there's more reasons than
ever for us to feel like we're NOT working hard enough, NOT being good
enough, NOT good enough, so many reasons to feel like shit.

It's a big conversation.  But I feel I'm always having it.  And it's
one of the most important ones to have some days, especially when I
meet young poets who have just been destroyed in workshops, made to
feel worthless.  The one poet started crying, and said, literally
between sobs, "ALL I WANT TO DO IS WRITE POETRY!"  It's really awful,
I just want to hit whoever did this to this person, but of course
that's not helpful.

The line crossed is hard to see because it's different for everyone, I
think.  Right?  Sometimes I'm not sure I'm right about that, but it
feels right, doesn't just feel like an answer I've come up with to
forget thinking about it, because I really want to figure it out, if
it can be figured out.  There's too much at stake, at least it feels
that way when I meet YET ANOTHER amazing young poet who becomes afraid
of workshops and other poets and stops writing.

I've met so many amazing poets who stop, for so many reasons they
stop.  The most common reason though is that they get worn out from
the struggle of dealing with many hungry egos.  And their own hungry
ego.  It goes back to the discussion about why we're writing, and what
has writing become in this world for us?

Some excellent points here. Much to chew on. The first things that come to =
mind are the following:=0A=0AFirst: holy encompasses more than does sacred.=
 A person can be holy, but is a person sacred? Places can be either holy or=
 sacred. This is a distinction (another person suggested "spiritual" -- whi=
ch is another word that I should address in this same context) I should add=
ress. My project here was to make people think about the way the word is us=
ed, so it is contra Wittgenstein in the spirit of Wittgenstein, so to speak=
.. =0A=0ASecond: I am arguing that, essentially, holiness and holism are the=
 same, but that the holiness/holism I am arguing for is not exclusive or wh=
ere one ideology dominates another. I agree with you that the pomo argument=
 against grand narratives is itself holistic, despite their best efforts (a=
s I pointed out once to a postmodernist, who didn't have an answer for my c=
laim). However, they do attempt to dispose of the whole/holiness, and I thi=
nk that is as dangerous as those who think holiness is cancer.=0A=0AThird: =
good, bad, and evil can be understood as: knowledge of the good, and doing =
it; ignorance of the good; knowledge of the good, and working against it. I=
 think, then, that to be good, you have to have knowledge, including knowle=
dge of the whole -- and have the wisdom to do it. Wisdom and knowledge comb=
ined constitute beauty, and the beautiful is holy. These are a few things I=
 need to make explicit and develop more. =0A=0ALike I said, these are just =
a few quick thoughts. Your observations are spot-on, and will help me to de=
velop these ideas much more. Thank you.=0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A______=

ubject: Re: On Health, Holiness, Beauty and Poetry=0A=0ATroy,=0AI often dis=
agree with you, but I can see a good deal of merit in your project here to =
reclaim the word holy.=0A=0AThe analytic philosopher in me (eminently moder=
nist, don't you know) wants a bit more rigor here though.=0A=0Ato that end =
i would consider the following pairings with the word holy and holiness whi=
ch I think maybe create some problems for what you're saying and that I thi=
nk need answering. Don't misunderstand me, I think that there can be answer=
s, I'm just curious about how the lines are drawn poetically and philosophi=
cally here.=0A=0Afirst: holy vs. sacred=0A=0Amy own first among equals in t=
he philosophical pantheon ludwig wittgenstein has counseled that in most ca=
ses the meaning of a word is it's use in a loanguage. To that end, we often=
 use the word holy in the same circumstance that we might also use the word=
 sacred. There is an overlap there just as there exists overlap between the=
 unholy and the profane. But the terms are not coextensive and therefore no=
t exact synonyms. I wonder what might be holy but not sacred and in where t=
he distinction lies.=0A=0Asecond: holiness vs holism=0Athere seems to be so=
me blurring going on between the two words that I'm not sure i understand. =
are you saying that holism is by definition holy? how then do you account f=
or competing views of holines? you touched on this a bit in what's below an=
d yr comments on metanarrative, but I'd like to see a more explicit develop=
ment of that thought, specifically given that the postmodern condition of s=
kepticism toward metanarratives (holiness in your view) is itself holistic.=
=0A=0Athird: the holy vs the good=0A=0Ais all that is holy good? is all tha=
t is good holy? if so, why the different words and wahat do we make of the =
different qualities associated with each? holiness hasa connotation of unap=
proachability and beyond the merely human, whereas goodness is something th=
at we can always seem ot find and appreciate. it is much like the aesthetic=
 in this way.=0A=0A=0AOn Jan 9, 2009, at 9:24 AM, Troy Camplin wrote:=0A=0A=

sease. For disease is the opposite of health.=0A> =0A> The Modern Era, whic=
h we are still in, though we may be at the end of it, began when Descartes =
split man in two =96 body and soul. It was a necessary division for the dev=
elopment of modern science (which Descartes all but admits to =96 the divis=
ion is so the Church will tend to the soul, while the body is left alone, t=
o be tended to by scientists such as Descartes), but it was certainly an un=
holy division (as all divisions are, by definition). Kant deepened this div=
ision. Hegel tried to mend it through philosophical synthesis. Marx tried t=
o mend it by recommending the overthrow of half of the world =96 the world =
would then be wholly Proletarian. Nietzsche responded to Hegel by dividing =
the world up even more =96 for him, humans are not divided into body and so=
ul, but are instead a series of masks. With postmodernism, the division is =
complete: men and women, multiculturalism, radical Cartesian individualism =
divide us up more and more. Any universality is=0A>  denied. A necessary de=
velopment =96 and not without its truth (I am aware of the irony of using t=
he word truth, which comes from the Old English treowth, related to the wor=
d troth, from which we get the word betrothed, to speak of an idea that is =
more interested in divorce than betrothal). But it is precisely as unholy a=
s one can get.=0A> =0A> The deep divisions fostered by postmodernism came a=
bout because of a view that grand narratives, attempts to universalize, and=
 seeing the world as holistic created the problems of the 20th Century. The=
 Marxist grand narrative gave us the gulag of the Soviet Union, the massacr=
es of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and any number of other slaughters done =
by governments who had embraced Marxist philosophy. We looked back on histo=
ry after the Holocaust, saw the grand narrative of Christianity had in the =
past itself promoted the killing of Jews =96 particularly in the Inquisitio=
n =96 and concluded that it too was dangerous. One could also mention The T=
error of the French Revolution. What did Marxism, Medieval Christianity, an=
d the French Revolution have in common? One thing was that they were all gr=
and narratives. Thus, the logic goes, it must be grand narratives which are=
 bad. And what do grand narratives do? They see the world as a whole, which=
 must be=0A>  encompassed by their ideology. To make the world a whole, it =
must be placed under their one ideology. Thus, holistic world views were se=
en as bad =96 thus were they, and holiness, rejected. The path to Heaven =
=96 whether that heaven was celestial or earthly =96 seemed to lead us stra=
ight into Hell. Perhaps in part the rejection of holding a holistic view ca=
me about because it is related to the holy, and the holy has been rejected.=
 To the extent that wisdom is the ability to see the unity of the world =96=
 meaning wisdom is the ability to see the world as holy =96 wisdom was also=
 rejected as impossible, perhaps even undesirable.=0A> =0A> The error in th=
is way of thinking derives from the error made in seeing Communism, Christi=
anity, or the ideals of the French Revolution as interested in seeing the w=
orld as holistic. None of them saw the world as holistic, as holy =96 they =
instead wanted to make the world whole, under their particular umbrellas. T=
hey too fostered divisions =96 there were enemies who had to be either conv=
erted or killed in order that the world could be made holy. =93For the cher=
ub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at tree of=
 life; and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed and appear inf=
inite and holy=94 (Blake =93The Marriage of Heaven and Hell=94). Now Blake =
here uses the word =93appear.=94 None of them saw the world as holy. It had=
 to be made so =96 through conflagration, if necessary. Postmodern thought,=
 by dividing the world even more, does not help us to see the world as holy=
 =96 quite the contrary. However, by insisting on=0A>  equality among the v=
arious parts =96 among individuals, among cultures, among religions, among =
any number of groups of individuals =96 postmodern thought may ironically m=
ake it now possible to see the world as being, rather than needing to becom=
e, holy.=0A> =0A> It may seem ironic to suggest that only by reaching the m=
ost severe of divisions =96 seeing the world as eminently unholy =96 that w=
e can finally come to see that the world is in fact holy, but I am not bein=
g ironic. To see the world as holy is not to see everything in the world as=
 equal in an egalitarian sense. There are hierarchies. To see the world as =
holy is to understand how everything fits into the world as a whole. It is =
to see the world as an immense organism, and to care for its health. An org=
anism is made up of systems, organs, tissues, cells, organelles, and variou=
s biochemicals. For one group to want to envelop the entire world in one wa=
y of thinking, believing, viewing the world, would be the same as one cell =
wanting to envelop the entire organism in that one type of cell. We have a =
word for cells that want to do that: cancer. The postmodernists have mistak=
en viewing the actions of cancerous cells for seeing the whole organism. Ca=
ncer must=0A>  be fought, not mistaken for the animal it is in. That is the=
 only way one can have a healthy organism =96 and it is the only way to hav=
e a holy world.. Like a healthy organism, a holy world is complex. Like a h=
ealthy organism, a holy world has smoothly working parts in communication w=
ith each other through clear rules that proscribe what each part needs to d=
o for the whole to work well. Like a healthy organism, this cannot come fro=
m any centralized authority =96 there is no one control cell in the body, a=
nd the brain must have the lungs just as much as the lungs must have the br=
ain. A holy world is like a healthy organism.=0A> =0A> In Negative Theology=
, one comes to know what God is by figuring out what God is not. Aristotle =
says that if you are not sure if something is good, try to figure out what =
is bad, and you can then deduce that what is good is its opposite.=0A> The =

l world, both having variety in unity, unity in variety, complexity, and fl=
uid hierarchy that is self-similar regardless of scale. All of the parts, l=
iving in love and friendship (which does not exclude healthy competition, s=

ve a holy world.=0A> =0A> In Greek, to kalon means the beautiful, but it ca=

elf, is praiseworthy or whatever, through being good [agathon], is pleasant=
 because it is good [agathon]. If this, then, is the kalon, then virtue is =
necessarily kalon; for it is praiseworthy because of being good [agathon]=
=94 (79). Elaine Scarry points out that in English too, there is a connecti=
on between beauty and the good (the just), when she points out that to say =
that something is fair is to say that it is either beautiful or that it is =
just. In Greek and in English, the beautiful and the good are connected. If=
 a holy world is a beautiful world, it is a good and just world as well. As=
 Heraclitus said, =93For god all things are fair and just, but men have tak=
en some things as=0A>  unjust, others as just=94 (LXVIII). The key here is =
that we see the world itself as just =96 not the actions of each and every =
individual. The world is itself justified and cannot itself be unjust. This=
 is consistent with the teachings of any religion that sees the world as ha=
ving been created by God or the gods =96 how could a fair and just god crea=
te a world that was itself unjust? And if theistic religions are rejected, =
how can the world itself possibly be unjust? To say it is unjust is to give=
 it anthropomorphic qualities. It is people who have taken some things as b=
eing just, others as unjust =96 but the world itself is self-justified. Tho=
se who do not see the world as just are those who do not see the world as h=
oly =96 often they are the same people who think the only way the world can=
 be justified is if the world is made holy through the transformation of it=
 into a perfect mirror of themselves. But we have seen that a world made up=
 of only one=0A>  world view is a cancerous world =96 and the world, as a c=
ancerous organism, will die. An organism cannot consist of one type of cell=
 =96 that is the unhealthiest of organisms. And a world having only one wor=
ld view is the unhealthiest of worlds. In the same way that a healthy body =
consists of a variety of cells that are variations of the same theme coded =
by identical DNA, a healthy world consists of a variety of peoples that are=
 variations of the same themes coded for by our being human and sharing the=
 same cultural universals.=0A> =0A> Beauty is also related to health =96 as=
 we can see in the beauty we find in nature. Healthy plants produce the mos=
t beautiful flowers. Healthy peacocks produce the largest, most symmetrical=
, most colorful feathers. Healthy gobies and other territorial reef fish ha=
ve the brightest colors. All of this natural beauty is the advertisement of=
 health to the opposite sex. The healthiest human bodies (neither overweigh=
t nor super model thin) are the most beautiful. Thus is there also a relati=
onship between health, beauty, and sex. If beauty can thus be equated to he=
alth, we can see that beauty is again equated to the holy. And we can see t=
oo that sex in-and-of-itself is and cannot be unholy, as it is connected (b=
ut not equivalent) to beauty.=0A> =0A> A holy world is a whole world. It is=
 a healthy world. It is a good and just world. It is a complex world. It is=
 a world of individuals in community. It is a beautiful world. But is it a =
possible world? I have already given the answer: the world is itself alread=
y holy. We just have to learn to see it as holy. That is how we will heal t=
he world. And, as we do, we will become less and less likely to want or try=
 to eliminate those who disagree with us =96 until we are all in agreement =
on this one issue, as all the cells in an organism are in agreement on the =
one issue that they must work together for the health of the whole, even as=
 each performs its own function. Thus, the world will become more and more =
holy in our eyes. In works of tragedy, nomos (convention, human law, naming=
; from which we get the words nomad and nomenclature, and which is the chan=
ging and changeable aspect of the world) comes into conflict with physis (o=
r nature; from which we get the=0A>  word physics). That is the position we=
 are now in. When we get nomos to map onto physis (Heraclitus calls this co=
njunction logos =96 which can be translated as saying, speech, discourse, w=
ord, account, explanation, reason, principle, collection, enumeration, rati=
o, proportion), we will see the world as it truly is: holy.=0A> =0A> On the=
 Holy=0A> =0A> Where lies the holy in the modern world?=0A> It lies in Blak=

To extrapolate:

Since as it becomes easier to get laid for free the stuff a
prostitute has to do to make a living gets weirder everybody should
keep their legs crossed.

Did I get it right?

I'm ok with folks doing what they want to make a living, even if they
only do it because they feel bad about themselves, and people buying
their services, even if they only do it because they feel bad about
themselves. Unless we legislate mental health (and assume that the
motivations are always unhealthy) it's the best we're likely to do.

Coercion of any kind is another matter. Legalization makes it a lot
easier to fight coercion (and incidentally to minimize the spread of disease).

I'd say the same for drug use, even though most people probably
shouldn't put a spike in their arm.

In response to Amy King's request:


CHICAGO LAUNCH FOR SINA QUEYRAS'S EXPRESSWAY

February 11- 14, the Association of Writers & Writing Programs comes =20
to Chicago. The AWP Conference will bring some of North America's (and =20=

the world's) finest writers to the city.

During the festivities, Links Hall is hosting several literary events, =20=

among them, the launch of Sina Queyras's new poetry collection, =20
Expressway. Expressway, inspired by the modes of the Romantic poets, =20
explores the subject of modern transportation.

Sina Queyras, winner of a Lambda Award (for Lemon Hound), former =20
organizer of the belladonna* series, and noted poetry blogger =20
(lemonhound.blogspot.com), launches Expressway on Thursday, February =20
12, with the help of some friends. Reading with Queyras will be =20
Vanessa Place (Dies: A Sentence), Adam Sol (Jeremiah, Ohio) and Kevin =20=

Connolly (Revolver).

We hope you'll join us. Please see below for event details and more =20
information about Expressway and all the authors.

Chicago Launch of Sina Queyras's Expressway
with readings by Sina Queyras, Vanessa Place, Adam Sol and Kevin =20
Connolly
Thursday, February 12
8:30 - 9:30 p.m.
Links Hall, 3435 N. Sheffield Avenue
Chicago, IL
$5 admission

http://www.linkshall.org/a-locate.shtml



About Expressway:

Echoing the pastoral and elegiac modes of the Romantic poets, whose =20
reverence for nature never prevented them from addressing it with all =20=

ideas and sensibilities their times allowed, Sina Queyras=92s stunning =20=

new collection explores the infrastructures and means of modern =20
mobility. Addressing the human project not so much as something =20
imposed on nature but as an increasingly disturbing activity within =20
it, Expressway exposes the paradox of modern movement and connection: =20=

we build more and more roads and highways (concrete and fibre optic), =20=

but rather than feeling more connected =96 to the natural, to each other =
=20
=96 the more disenfranchised and anxious we seem to become. 'Cleanse the =
=20
doors of perception,' Blake urged, and with that in mind, Queyras has =20=

written a bravely lyrical critique of our ethical and ecological =20
imprint, a legacy easily blamed on corporations and commerce, but one =20=

we=92ve allowed, through our tacit acquiescence, to overwhelm us. Every =20=

brush stroke, every bolt, and nut, every form and curve in our =20
networks of oil and rubber, every thought and its material outcome =96 =20=

each decision can make or unmake us.

SINA QUEYRAS is the author of Lemon Hound, which won the Pat Lowther =20
Award and a Lambda Award, as well as the poetry collections Slip and =20
Teethmarks. She edited the anthology Open Field: 30 Contemporary =20
Canadian Poets. She has taught creative writing at Rutgers and =20
Haverford. A former curator of New York City=92s belladonna* reading =20
series, Queyras currently lives in Montreal.

VANESSA PLACE is the author of Dies: A Sentence (Les Figues Press), =20
and a chapbook, Figure from The Gates of Paradise (Woodland Editions). =20=

Other work has appeared in Northwest Review, Contemporary Literary =20
Criticism, and Five Fingers Review.

ADAM SOL is the author of two collections of poetry, Jonah's Promise, =20=

which won Mid-List Press's First Series Award for Poetry, and Crowd of =20=

Sounds, which won the Trillium Award for Poetry. He is also the author =20=

of numerous essays and reviews, and teaches English at the Laurentian =20=

University at Georgian College Program.

KEVIN CONNOLLY is the author of Revolver (Anansi, 2008). Connolly's =20
first collection of poems, Asphalt Cigar (Coach House, 1995), was =20
nominated for the 1996 Gerald Lampert Award. His second collection, =20
Happyland (ECW), was published to wide acclaim in 2002; and his most =20
recent collection, drift (Anansi, 2005), won the Trillium Book Award =20
for Poetry. He lives with his partner, Gil Adamson, in Toronto, and =20
works as poetry editor for Coach House Books.

The Workshop system is damned from the start, regardless of what level you
institute it.

It's Royal Academy Technique.

*Teach the dumbbunnies.

        <sigh>

The UK (once) Group system was more closely modeled on the attelier method
(it all goes back to the plastic arts, doesn't it?) and is more difficult to
institutionlise, though it can be run easily inside even an academic context
...

The revolution will come when the last Workshop Moderator is hung from a
sonnet by the guts of the final ... whatever.

(Mind you, there'll be blood on the walls regardless of the strategy you
adopt.)

True, true. My point is that classic literature and verse should be held as=
 sacrosanct. Journalism and these types of trivial newsposts are throw-away=
-- it seems that everywhere there is this new casual take on what's previou=
sly been considered sacred, and insistence upon dumb word play and misusing=
 or not attributing phrases just to make a headline. This is what's aggrava=
ting to me. Anyway, thanks for the email. (And actually, it's probably not =
your subject line to begin with...)=20=20

Huxley actually took the phrase from Milton's SAMSON AGONISTES.

Stephen, this is in regards to your Subject Line title-- "Eyeless in Gaza".=
 Yes, it's a clever quip. Yet where do you credit Aldous Huxley, or make me=
ntion of his amazing book of the same title? Huxley surely was not politica=

f his creative genius being used to label a rant/opinion on current events,=
 such as yours. Turning over in his grave...?=20=20

Back to the (mis)appropriation issue, it seems. Everywhere lazy editors and=
 writers are reusing/misusing scholarly or popular phrases and titles with =
no regard for where these strings of words originated. It's pandemic in the=
 new century. Is this madness, a part of the trade, a happenstance? What ar=

preciated.

It is no longer 'Eyeless in Gaza" - Israel's attempts to keep the media out=
 of Gaza notwithstanding, on the outside we have more than an absolutely aw=

Thanks for this note, Sarah.  I wish I could have been at this event, &
just thought I would add John Wieners's own send-up to your list . . .


FOR HUNCKE by John Wieners


Knowing no other god than this:
the man who places on your mouth
a kiss. Keep no mystery
but his who whispers memory.

Though he lead you to the desert
or over hills where famine
flowers, like the locust
he devours what he loves most.

Saving none for tomorrow, or dawn
comes with empty arms, and he knows no way
to feed himself, feeding off others,
he has many, who find him, help him

you be one and dedicate your life
and misery to the upkeep of this cheapskate
you love so much no one else
seems to bridge the gap

with their common habits and rude manners,
his never were, a perfect gentleman
who leaves no trace, but lingers through the room
after he has gone, so I would follow

anywhere, over desert or mountain,
it's all the same if he's by my side.
The guide and wizard I would worship and obey,
my guardian teacher, who knows how to stay

alive on practically nothing in the city
until help comes, usually from a stranger or youth.
Such I am or was who knew no better
but all that I better forget now since I met you

and fell into that pit of the past with no escape.
You knock on the door, and off I go with you
into the night with not even a cent in my pockets,
without caring where or when I get back

But if once you put your hand on my shoulders
as David Rattray did last evening
that would be enough, on the seventh night
of the seventh moon, when Herd Boy

meets the Weaving Lady in heaven
and wanders forever lost in arms
until dawn when you come no more.

Brilliant essay, Jan 9:Troy Camplin.=20

I take on faith that God is not apathetic. Perhaps this is why I'm so struc=
k by Simone Weil, the greatest Christian gnostic of the 20th century. She d=
ied very young. & yes,=A0 her silence concerning the Holocaust is troubling=
. Had she lived longer, I suspect that she would not have remained silent.

Anyone who considers themselves Christian should be grateful that the writi=

 sense as she couldn't stomach the unflinching violence in the Old Testamen=
t) woman survived.=20

Simone did not survive an ugly, dark time.=20

Some excellent points here. Much to chew on. The first things that come to =
mind
are the following:

First: holy encompasses more than does sacred. A person can be holy, but is=
 a
person sacred? Places can be either holy or sacred. This is a distinction
(another person suggested "spiritual" -- which is another word that I
should address in this same context) I should address. My project here was =
to
make people think about the way the word is used, so it is contra Wittgenst=
ein
in the spirit of Wittgenstein, so to speak..=20

Second: I am arguing that, essentially, holiness and holism are the same, b=
ut
that the holiness/holism I am arguing for is not exclusive or where one ide=
ology
dominates another. I agree with you that the pomo argument against grand
narratives is itself holistic, despite their best efforts (as I pointed out=
 once
to a postmodernist, who didn't have an answer for my claim). However, they
do attempt to dispose of the whole/holiness, and I think that is as dangero=
us as
those who think holiness is cancer.

Third: good, bad, and evil can be understood as: knowledge of the good, and
doing it; ignorance of the good; knowledge of the good, and working against=
 it.
I think, then, that to be good, you have to have knowledge, including knowl=
edge
of the whole -- and have the wisdom to do it. Wisdom and knowledge combined
constitute beauty, and the beautiful is holy. These are a few things I need=
 to
make explicit and develop more.=20

Like I said, these are just a few quick thoughts. Your observations are
spot-on, and will help me to develop these ideas much more. Thank you.

Troy Camplin

Subject: Re: On Health, Holiness, Beauty and Poetry

Troy,
I often disagree with you, but I can see a good deal of merit in your proje=
ct
here to reclaim the word holy.

The analytic philosopher in me (eminently modernist, don't you know) wants
a bit more rigor here though.

to that end i would consider the following pairings with the word holy and
holiness which I think maybe create some problems for what you're saying an=
d
that I think need answering. Don't misunderstand me, I think that there can
be answers, I'm just curious about how the lines are drawn poetically and
philosophically here.

first: holy vs. sacred

my own first among equals in the philosophical pantheon ludwig wittgenstein=
 has
counseled that in most cases the meaning of a word is it's use in a
loanguage. To that end, we often use the word holy in the same circumstance=
 that
we might also use the word sacred. There is an overlap there just as there
exists overlap between the unholy and the profane. But the terms are not
coextensive and therefore not exact synonyms. I wonder what might be holy b=
ut
not sacred and in where the distinction lies.

second: holiness vs holism
there seems to be some blurring going on between the two words that I'm not
sure i understand. are you saying that holism is by definition holy? how th=
en do
you account for competing views of holines? you touched on this a bit in
what's below and yr comments on metanarrative, but I'd like to see a
more explicit development of that thought, specifically given that the
postmodern condition of skepticism toward metanarratives (holiness in your =
view)
is itself holistic.

third: the holy vs the good

is all that is holy good? is all that is good holy? if so, why the differen=
t
words and wahat do we make of the different qualities associated with each?
holiness hasa connotation of unapproachability and beyond the merely human,
whereas goodness is something that we can always seem ot find and appreciat=
e. it
is much like the aesthetic in this way.

is
left alone, to be tended to by scientists such as Descartes), but it was
certainly an unholy division (as all divisions are, by definition). Kant
deepened this division. Hegel tried to mend it through philosophical synthe=

Marx tried to mend it by recommending the overthrow of half of the world =

world would then be wholly Proletarian. Nietzsche responded to Hegel by div=

related to the word troth, from which we get the word betrothed, to speak o=

idea that is more interested in divorce than betrothal). But it is precisel=
y as
unholy as one can get.
>=20
> The deep divisions fostered by postmodernism came about because of a view
that grand narratives, attempts to universalize, and seeing the world as

Cambodia, and any number of other slaughters done by governments who had
embraced Marxist philosophy. We looked back on history after the Holocaust,=
 saw
the grand narrative of Christianity had in the past itself promoted the kil=

 did
Marxism, Medieval Christianity, and the French Revolution have in common? O=

thing was that they were all grand narratives. Thus, the logic goes, it mus=

grand narratives which are bad. And what do grand narratives do? They see t=

thus were they, and holiness, rejected. The path to Heaven =96 whether that
heaven was celestial or earthly =96 seemed to lead us straight into Hell.

to see that the world is in fact holy, but I am not being ironic. To see th=

world as holy is not to see everything in the world as equal in an egalitar=

everything fits into the world as a whole. It is to see the world as an imm=

tissues, cells, organelles, and various biochemicals. For one group to want=

would be the same as one cell wanting to envelop the entire organism in tha=

type of cell. We have a word for cells that want to do that: cancer. The

> In Greek, to kalon means the beautiful, but it can also mean the honorabl=

or the noble =96 and kala can mean either things that are beautiful or thin=

that are morally good. In the Rhetoric, Aristotle says that =93Now kalon
describes whatever, through being chosen for itself, is praiseworthy or
whatever, through being good [agathon], is pleasant because it is good
[agathon]. If this, then, is the kalon, then virtue is necessarily kalon; f=
or it
is praiseworthy because of being good [agathon]=94 (79). Elaine Scarry poin=
ts
out that in English too, there is a connection between beauty and the good =
(the
just), when she points out that to say that something is fair is to say tha=
t it
is either beautiful or that it is just. In Greek and in English, the beauti=
ful
and the good are connected. If a holy world is a beautiful world, it is a g=
ood
and just world as well. As Heraclitus said, =93For god all things are fair =
and
just, but men have taken some things as
>  unjust, others as just=94 (LXVIII). The key here is that we see the worl=
d
itself as just =96 not the actions of each and every individual. The world =
is
itself justified and cannot itself be unjust. This is consistent with the
teachings of any religion that sees the world as having been created by God=
 or
the gods =96 how could a fair and just god create a world that was itself
unjust? And if theistic religions are rejected, how can the world itself
possibly be unjust? To say it is unjust is to give it anthropomorphic quali=
ties.
It is people who have taken some things as being just, others as unjust =96=
 but
the world itself is self-justified. Those who do not see the world as just =
are
those who do not see the world as holy =96 often they are the same people w=
ho
think the only way the world can be justified is if the world is made holy
through the transformation of it into a perfect mirror of themselves. But w=
e
have seen that a world made up of only one
>  world view is a cancerous world =96 and the world, as a cancerous
organism, will die. An organism cannot consist of one type of cell =96 that=
 is
the unhealthiest of organisms. And a world having only one world view is th=
e
unhealthiest of worlds. In the same way that a healthy body consists of a
variety of cells that are variations of the same theme coded by identical D=
NA, a
healthy world consists of a variety of peoples that are variations of the s=
ame
themes coded for by our being human and sharing the same cultural universal=
s.
>=20
> Beauty is also related to health =96 as we can see in the beauty we find
in nature. Healthy plants produce the most beautiful flowers. Healthy peaco=
cks
produce the largest, most symmetrical, most colorful feathers. Healthy gobi=
es
and other territorial reef fish have the brightest colors. All of this natu=
ral
beauty is the advertisement of health to the opposite sex. The healthiest h=
uman
bodies (neither overweight nor super model thin) are the most beautiful. Th=
us is
there also a relationship between health, beauty, and sex. If beauty can th=
us be
equated to health, we can see that beauty is again equated to the holy. And=
 we
can see too that sex in-and-of-itself is and cannot be unholy, as it is
connected (but not equivalent) to beauty.
>=20
> A holy world is a whole world. It is a healthy world. It is a good and
just world. It is a complex world. It is a world of individuals in communit=
y. It
is a beautiful world. But is it a possible world? I have already given the
answer: the world is itself already holy. We just have to learn to see it a=
s
holy. That is how we will heal the world. And, as we do, we will become les=
s and
less likely to want or try to eliminate those who disagree with us =96 unti=
l we
are all in agreement on this one issue, as all the cells in an organism are=
 in
agreement on the one issue that they must work together for the health of t=
he
whole, even as each performs its own function. Thus, the world will become =
more
and more holy in our eyes. In works of tragedy, nomos (convention, human la=
w,
naming; from which we get the words nomad and nomenclature, and which is th=
e
changing and changeable aspect of the world) comes into conflict with physi=
s (or
nature; from which we get the

map onto physis (Heraclitus calls this conjunction logos =96 which can be
translated as saying, speech, discourse, word, account, explanation, reason=
,
principle, collection, enumeration, ratio, proportion), we will see the wor=

it truly is: holy.

Recently I've met a couple of young poets (yet again) who dropped out
of poetry writing workshops because they were, in the words of one of
these poets, "eaten alive."

The conversation isn't new.  And it's not a conversation about
workshops in particular, but competition in a bigger sense.

When is competition good, meaning productive, meaning THE THING which
spurs poets into action in the best sense, in the sense of WANTING to
write as well as they can.

And when is competition ugly, filled with envy and jealousy, reaching
a surprising number of times in my observations to the most corrupt,
wicked, disturbing places people can get to.

The conversation is tricky because I'm always trying to ask,
investigate with others, WHERE IS THE line between competition when
it's healthy, and rotten?

There's no doubt in my mind that these two young poets (the latest two
that is, as I've been having this conversation for years now and I
don't even remember how many times I've had it frankly) love, really
LOVE poetry.  We share that, we find when talking that we share that
DRIVE, depositing ourselves in front of bookstore poetry sections, and
libraries, and asking everyone we know who their favorite poets are,
and titles, and never getting enough of this love.  Never getting
enough of it.  And not just feeling sad when a bookstore like GOTHAM
BOOKMART closes down but ANGRY!

We're so much alike, and we tell one another what we're most excited
about NOW, and everyone's scratching notes for the library and
bookstore.  How we're NOT alike is that these two young poets are VERY
vulnerable to attack.  When they were said to be "eaten alive"
I'm not
surprised.  And I'm sad, and wish they were MORE LIKE ME and laugh at
the bastards and say, "OH YOU'RE JUST A HATER, YOU JEALOUS PIG!"=20
Or,
"Yeah well, THANKS, being attacked GETS ME UP IN THE MORNING TO MAKE
YOU ANGRY!"  It feeds me when someone attacks me, I LOVE it.

But of course a lot of people don't respond well when they're
attacked, and this makes me sad.  I've known poets WHOSE POEMS MADE ME
HAPPY who stopped writing poems because of such attacks.  In some
cases the attacks were from their professors, and the other students,
egged-on by the professors.  A FEEDING FRENZY in such a way that makes
me want to puke for poetry.  It disgusts me this kind of behavior.

I'm not a professor, but I have conducted poetry workshops, and it's
NOT HARD AT ALL in my opinion to keep the focus about everyone
(including myself because I want to learn from THEM TOO!)
investigating poetry together!  My focus is about PROCESS, about the
many weird ways to MAKE poetry happen, NOT ABOUT who is writing poems
I think are good, or another person in the workshop thinks are good,
or not.

This is NOT goody-two-shoe bullshit, I'm JUST NOT INTERESTED in
telling someone whether I like their poems or not when I'm conducting
workshops.  And it's none of my business frankly.  But to LOVE poetry,
and read it, and create it, and have it in our lives, now THAT is
something I get very excited about!

But what is that line?  When is it crossed from productive and
beautiful and everyone's excited and MAKING poetry, to that place of
shit?

I'd rather see poems ABOUT that dark spot on the poetry map, than see
it overwhelm another poet.  And I mean overwhelm the poet who NEEDS to
be vicious, and of course I mean the poet who gets beaten down.

This conversation cannot happen unless we talk about the bigger things
around it, like, WHY IS EVERYONE NOT UNDERSTANDING EVERYONE IS
CREATIVE WE ARE ALL CREATIVE THIS IS NOT UP FOR DEBATE.  Or is it?
I've had people tell me this is wrong, that everyone's NOT creative.
But I disagree.

And the conversation needs to be about how the way poets act about
scarcity and fear that there's not enough NOT ENOUGH magazines NOT
ENOUGH awards or enough room at the reading series, not enough, is
really, such an old story about us being animals.

And the conversation needs to be about how to protect ourselves if we
can't withstand the attacks.

And the conversation needs to be about how people don't need to attack
others because THERE IS ENOUGH.

And the conversation needs to be about how art and all our creative
abilities have become part of a big system in the capital of art and
poetry, and books, and writing programs and teaching and, and, and
CONSUMPTION, and frankly how, more than ever there's more reasons than
ever for us to feel like we're NOT working hard enough, NOT being good
enough, NOT good enough, so many reasons to feel like shit.

It's a big conversation.  But I feel I'm always having it.  And
it's
one of the most important ones to have some days, especially when I
meet young poets who have just been destroyed in workshops, made to
feel worthless.  The one poet started crying, and said, literally
between sobs, "ALL I WANT TO DO IS WRITE POETRY!"  It's really
awful,
I just want to hit whoever did this to this person, but of course
that's not helpful.

The line crossed is hard to see because it's different for everyone, I
think.  Right?  Sometimes I'm not sure I'm right about that, but it
feels right, doesn't just feel like an answer I've come up with to
forget thinking about it, because I really want to figure it out, if
it can be figured out.  There's too much at stake, at least it feels
that way when I meet YET ANOTHER amazing young poet who becomes afraid
of workshops and other poets and stops writing.

I've met so many amazing poets who stop, for so many reasons they
stop.  The most common reason though is that they get worn out from
the struggle of dealing with many hungry egos.  And their own hungry
ego.  It goes back to the discussion about why we're writing, and what
has writing become in this world for us?

Gilmore Boys

http://www.myspace.com/thesewingcircle

=93[Preston Spurlock and my] very specific and delightful side-project=97
we only write songs based on the Gilmore Girls, and the lyrics of
said songs are only based on poems by David Kirschenbaum.=94 =97Casey =20=

Holford

These songs come from my monthly poem writing projects, with this work =20=

spanning June 7, 2005 to May 1, 2007, 694 days and 687 poems, 28 of =20
which referenced Gilmore Girls. I=92ll be reading a few of those 28 =20
poems, then Gilmore Boys will perform their songs of still others. =20
Preston and Casey are great musicians, and they=92ve done some pretty =20=

wonderful work turning these poems into songs, deciding what would be =20=

best as choruses and verses, making each piece fun and  distinct.

This is all part of Casey=92s monthlong of Tuesdays residency at the =20
Sidewalk Caf=E9, ending on Jan. 27 with a performance by his band =20
Outlines.

Toby Goodshank
http://www.myspace.com/tobygoodshank

A prolific performer, Moldy Peach Goodshank inhabits the stages of NYC =20=

solo and with bands Double Deuce (along with sister Angela Babyskin) =20
and The Tri-Lambs (with Angela and her sister Crystal Babyskin). These =20=

projects have "Goodshank" written all over them, with his signature =20
heart-felt pornographic tendencies lending the songs a sense of erotic =20=

wonder and innocence. If Anti-Folk has ever known a legend in the =20
making, destined to have his records collected by the troubled =20
teenagers of the future, it is Toby Goodshank.


Directions: F/V to 2nd Ave., L to 1st Ave.

Grad Student Selling Virginity Flooded With Offers

http://cbs13.com/local/selling.virginity.tuition.2.815171.html

A Sacramento State grad trying to make money by auctioning off her
virginity to help pay for her graduate studies is getting lots of
offers...and not just for sex.

The 22-year-old who is using the pseudonym Natalie Dylan for safety
reasons is going through a legal brothel in Nevada to sell her
virginity. Dylan told CBS13 she's gotten an offer of $250,000.  And
now she's gotten an offer to do a photo spread for Penthouse magazine.

The auction is being handled by the Bunny Ranch in Carson City, Nevada
with bids coming in through their website.

Dylan says she's already taken a polygraph test to prove her virginal
status, and is also willing to undergo a medical exam.

"The main purpose of this is to finance a couple things in my life,"
Dylan told CBS13.  "I think empowerment of women is picking yourself
up and doing something on your own to better yourself."

So far, hundreds of offers have already come in including some from
male virgins.  Natalie says she won't give up her virginity to the
highest bidder.  She's also seeking other qualities from her first
lover. "I'm looking for intelligence and an overall nice person," said
Dylan.

Dylan says she ended up in a financial bind, because her stepfather
allegedly used her college status to fraudulently apply for student
loans, and then ran off with the money.

Dylan earned her bachelor's degree in women's studies from Sacramento
State and plans to get her master's at the school beginning in January.

Many Sac State students say they're shocked to hear about their former
classmate's plan, while others applaud her.

"She's just giving it to some random person. And I just think she
should be giving it to someone special she loves," said one student on
campus.

While another felt that selling her virginity for grad school "is a
noble reason to get money."

As for Natalie, after claiming to hold on to her virginity for 22
years (although the Bunny Ranch website claims she is 21-years-old),
she says she has a commodity not many people have to sell.

"When I was younger, I wanted 100% romance, possibly even wait for
marriage.  But as I grew up, reality kinda hit.  And I think its a
capitalistic society and I want to capitalize on this," explained Dylan.

well, you're ok with it but are they ok with it? I mean, doesn't it hurt

Aren't you talking about motivation? If there were no coercion, would
it be ok for people to choose to do things that might hurt them? What
other potentially self-destructive things should we make illegal?
Demolition derbies? Surfing? Skateboarding? Smoking? Drinking? MFA
programs? Or if we limit the list to sexual behavior, which is
apparently a separate category? one night stands? Sleeping with
musicians? A list would be helpful.

Additional inquiry might include these questions:

=20

Can post-modern/post-structural "poetry" handle Nature?

=20

Isn't postmodern and post-structural, for better AND for worse, a subset
of nature, including our species' frequently incommensurate and
dysfunctional and human-centric, usually unverifiable and generally
SELF-serving definitions of it?

=20

Should pomers truly concerned with developing interesting, fun, serious,
irreverent, heady, simple, useful, and smiling nature poetries prescribe
for themselves the onus of having to appeal to so-called
postmodern/post-structural exigencies, which are, after all, largely or
at least ALSO cottage industry consumer products developed by the
academia industries, NOT necessarily OBJECTS of real, concrete,
substantial relevance to "nature" OR "poetry" in the first place, the
second place, or the 3rd?

=20

Also, seriously, cannot postmodern/post-structural play an honorable
role in saving nature, without which we're not going to have ANY poetry,
jobs in academia, or EPC forums, ultimately?

I wonder if we put too high a price on women's sexuality--I was of the gene=

Grad Student Selling Virginity Flooded With Offers

http://cbs13.com/local/selling.virginity.tuition.2.815171.html

A Sacramento State grad trying to make money by auctioning off her virginit=
y to help pay for her graduate studies is getting lots of offers...and not =
just for sex.

The 22-year-old who is using the pseudonym Natalie Dylan for safety reasons=
 is going through a legal brothel in Nevada to sell her virginity. Dylan to=
ld CBS13 she's gotten an offer of $250,000.=A0 And now she's gotten an offe=
r to do a photo spread for Penthouse magazine.

The auction is being handled by the Bunny Ranch in Carson City, Nevada with=
 bids coming in through their website.

Dylan says she's already taken a polygraph test to prove her virginal statu=
s, and is also willing to undergo a medical exam.

"The main purpose of this is to finance a couple things in my life," Dylan =
told CBS13.=A0 "I think empowerment of women is picking yourself up and doi=
ng something on your own to better yourself."

So far, hundreds of offers have already come in including some from male vi=
rgins.=A0 Natalie says she won't give up her virginity to the highest bidde=
r.=A0 She's also seeking other qualities from her first lover. "I'm looking=
 for intelligence and an overall nice person," said Dylan.

Dylan says she ended up in a financial bind, because her stepfather alleged=
ly used her college status to fraudulently apply for student loans, and the=
n ran off with the money.

Dylan earned her bachelor's degree in women's studies from Sacramento State=
 and plans to get her master's at the school beginning in January.

Many Sac State students say they're shocked to hear about their former clas=
smate's plan, while others applaud her.

"She's just giving it to some random person. And I just think she should be=
 giving it to someone special she loves," said one student on campus.

While another felt that selling her virginity for grad school "is a noble r=
eason to get money."

As for Natalie, after claiming to hold on to her virginity for 22 years (al=
though the Bunny Ranch website claims she is 21-years-old), she says she ha=
s a commodity not many people have to sell.

"When I was younger, I wanted 100% romance, possibly even wait for marriage=
.=A0 But as I grew up, reality kinda hit.=A0 And I think its a capitalistic=
 society and I want to capitalize on this," explained Dylan.

The Papers of the Irish poet Thomas Kinsella have gone to the MARBL
Library at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.

For a detailed inventory of the Papers of Thomas Kinsella, go to
http://irishliterature.library.emory.edu/content.php?id=3Dkinsella774_10109=
13

Amazingly, the MARBL Library at Emory also holds the Papers of the
Irish poets Seamus Heaney, Ciaran Carson, Peter Fallon/The Gallery
Press Collection, Ted Hughes, Michael Longley, Derek Mahon, Medbh
McGuckian, Charles Montieth, Paul Muldoon, Edna O'Brien, Desmond
O'Grady, Frank Ormsby, Tom Paulin, and James Simmons as well as other
more or less contemporary Irish poets.  Most of these manuscript
collections have been purchased by Emory.

For an index of Irish literary collections,
mostly at the MARBL Library of Emory University, go to
http://irishliterature.library.emory.edu/browse.php

Amazing! that the National Library of Ireland would not have acted
more decisively to keep these manuscript collections (of literary and
historic importance) in Ireland!

Or, is it not so amazing after all? given the back-of-the-hand
treatment to most Irish authors in the past and present.

For information about the Irish
Literary Collections Portal, go to
http://irishliterature.library.emory.edu/

In 1985, in Duluth, Minnesota, I was privileged to introduce Thomas
Kinsella at his reading before an audience of 400 people.  I enjoyed
several days of lengthy conversations with Kinsella.  I learned quite
a lot from him about the varieties of innovative and not-so-innovative
approaches to contemporary poetry.  Indeed, it is NOT Seamus Heaney
but Thomas Kinsella that I see as the grand old man of contemporary
Irish poetry!

At that time, on his visit in 1985, Kinsella was very interested to
learn of Lady Augusta Gregory's reaction to the city of Duluth.  In
February of 1914, Lady Gregory came to Duluth to participate in the
founding of the Little Theatre, a breakaway from the commercial
theatre of that day.  (Bernard Shaw was also involved in the founding
of this Little Theatre.)  As Lady Gregory arrived on the scene, the
harbor and the western end of Lake Superior were filled with ice.  And
further east on the great lake, in motion, there were huge ice floes.
Lady Gregory said she had never before seen "icebergs"!  Throughout
her time in Duluth, she kept talking about the "icebergs," and the
"beauty" of the "icebergs"!

Regards, from the icebergs of Lake Superior,

Many thanks to all who have sent suggestions on/off list. Remembered a
few of my own favorites: Lyn Lifshin and Geraldine Green. I was
appalled with Richard Louv's opinion about the lack of nature found in
modern "urban" poetry and needed some affirmation :)

In the end, who are you or I or anybody else to tell someone what they can and cannot do, to prevent people from hurting themselves (especially if it's our opinion that they are hurting themselves)? It seems pretty arrogant to tell adults what they can and cannot do with their own bodies and minds. We can quibble all day about whether or not prostitutes under legalized conditions are "hurt" by the job or not, but in the end, we don't know what a person likes or does not lie, is hurt by or is not hurt by, prefers or does not prefer precisely because we cannot be inside their heads, knowing any of those things. Faced with such overwhelming ignorance of such things about others, we should let people do what they want to do and be who they want to be so long as it doesn't involve force or threat of force. THis isn't to say that one should not be out there trying to create conditions where women don't have to choose prostitution, that one shouldn't be trying
 to change minds -- but it is to say that one should not be using either force or the threat of force to make people do what you want or make them accept what you think is best for them.

well, you're ok with it but are they ok with it? I mean, doesn't it hurt

Being eaten alive in a workshop isn't a bad thing. If you can't stand criticism of your work, you won't improve much as an artist. This isn't to say that everything in a workshop is golden (it isn't), but you come out with many perspectives and, if you know what you're really hearing, you can figure out what's really wrong that needs work among the comments and criticisms. But CA is right, you do have to be careful to distinguish between those who wish to help you, and those who are envious and want to tear you down, to "get rid of the competition." Again, if you're paying attention, it does become pretty obvious before long. Be on the lookout for those who come up to you later and apologize for "being so rough" and/or who offer more suggestions or offer to look at it again after the revision. Those are the ones who want to help you. They will also more likely be the good poets. Nasty, antisocial, selfish people do not have the wisdom necessary to be
 great poets. Or even good or mediocre poets.

I agree that there is a problem with women all too often seeing the world through men's perspectives. One of the flaws of the feminist movement in the U.S. was the acceptance of male virtues as the only virtues, meaning women should emulate men -- and that emulation was not just in the economy, but in sexuality as well. The truth is that there are manly/masculine virtues as well as womanly/feminine virtues (as well as human virtues) that are not better or worse than the other, but merely different and, typically, complementary. It benefits everyone, especially couples, when the two are in balance. I also have a suspicion that in the greatest artists, the two are balanced within the individual him-/herself.

I wonder if we put too high a price on women's sexuality--I was of the generation that came of age during the late 60's, and we women were so damn glad to throw away our parents' prudishness about what "good girls do." I am sure that men were overjoyed, and as I write that I wonder why I suddenly feel "prickly" (I didn't mean that to be a play on words.)  about men also feeling liberated. I suppose our views on sexuality are such a part of our culture that it is hard to separate culture from nature. Our intellects and talents are also part of the free market. Tthe other problem is that women are still seeing their world through men's perspectives--not always, but often. I think that is obvious.

Grad Student Selling Virginity Flooded With Offers

http://cbs13.com/local/selling.virginity.tuition.2.815171.html

A Sacramento State grad trying to make money by auctioning off her virginity to help pay for her graduate studies is getting lots of offers...and not just for sex.

The 22-year-old who is using the pseudonym Natalie Dylan for safety reasons is going through a legal brothel in Nevada to sell her virginity. Dylan told CBS13 she's gotten an offer of $250,000.  And now she's gotten an offer to do a photo spread for Penthouse magazine.

The auction is being handled by the Bunny Ranch in Carson City, Nevada with bids coming in through their website.

Dylan says she's already taken a polygraph test to prove her virginal status, and is also willing to undergo a medical exam.

"The main purpose of this is to finance a couple things in my life," Dylan told CBS13.  "I think empowerment of women is picking yourself up and doing something on your own to better yourself."

So far, hundreds of offers have already come in including some from male virgins.  Natalie says she won't give up her virginity to the highest bidder.  She's also seeking other qualities from her first lover. "I'm looking for intelligence and an overall nice person," said Dylan.

Dylan says she ended up in a financial bind, because her stepfather allegedly used her college status to fraudulently apply for student loans, and then ran off with the money.

Dylan earned her bachelor's degree in women's studies from Sacramento State and plans to get her master's at the school beginning in January.

Many Sac State students say they're shocked to hear about their former classmate's plan, while others applaud her.

"She's just giving it to some random person. And I just think she should be giving it to someone special she loves," said one student on campus.

While another felt that selling her virginity for grad school "is a noble reason to get money."

As for Natalie, after claiming to hold on to her virginity for 22 years (although the Bunny Ranch website claims she is 21-years-old), she says she has a commodity not many people have to sell.

"When I was younger, I wanted 100% romance, possibly even wait for marriage.  But as I grew up, reality kinda hit.  And I think its a capitalistic society and I want to capitalize on this," explained Dylan.

Actually I think that the Poetry Brothel may just be about what lengths peo=
ple will go to "attract an audience"--and a paying one at that!--for their =
poems.

Isn't this like a "Reality Show" version of "Writer's/Poet's Market" in a w=
ay?


Or those "Mystery Dinners" where you get to participate in a melodramatic m=
ystery story and eat fine food all at once?  And maybe someone really will =
die! From all the rich fare=2C instead of only simulating a heart attack to=
 surprise the unwitting into revealing themselves as dupes of expensive ill=
usions.


And won't some disgruntled client leave muttering darkly how they've just b=
een screwed by some really lame poetry cleverly concealed by artfully posed=
 cleavage or the seductive flip of a gigolo's hair in the fake breezes waft=
ed by hidden fans whose whirrings are lost amidst the banging of the bangle=
s on the long beaded strings operating as "harem decor" doors?


"It's like Weimar without the Nazis=2C" one of the jolly entrepreneurs purr=
s=2C blithely oblivious to the fascism eating away at the fabric of America=
n society for a long time now.=20

If one considers the brothel from the point of view of poetry=2C  isn't it =
 just as it advertises itself to be: --a much more "entertaining" and "enti=
cing" way of pimping one's works=2C because=2C after all =2C is that not wh=
at the "market place of ideas" and the hustling and foreclosing on "intelle=
ctual properties" is all about?


 Isn't it all like the Bert Brecht poem Fritz Lang starts to quote to the s=
ell-out self-prostituting writer played by Michel Piccoli in Godard's Le Me=
pris (Contempt)?--A poem to the effect that the poet is going down to the m=
arket (Hollywood)  to sell his poetic wares=2C just as Socrates taught down=
 by the market place=2C pimping his "intellectual  properties" to the beaut=
iful  young men as long as possible=2C  postponing to the last possible sec=
ond  the return  not to Ithaca and Penelope=2C but to the mighty shrew Xant=
hippe=2C the Founding Dominatrix of Philosophy's Sado-Masochistic tendencie=
s


In essaying to follow this thread through its labyrinth=2C it strikes me th=
at despite the outrage at the objectification of women=2C prostitutes thems=
elves remain locked in language of objectification to such an extent here t=
hat one wonders if they are altogether abstract beings=2C or categories=2C =
sub classifications-- rather than actual persons.=20



The neighborhood I live in is rife with prostitution. I'd say about 75% of =
the women over around 18 one speaks with at the bus stop or walking home at=
 night or during any time of the day are prostitutes.  The moment one goes =
out the door=2C they are waiting somewhere along the short block=2C close b=
y=2C or hanging out at the bus stop=2C greeting potential customers as they=
 step out onto the worn down Ghetto sidewalk=2C right by where the old  cov=
ered waiting station used to be before being removed.   That structure one =
day was gone=2C leaving only a concrete slab like a scab shoved into the si=
de of a scraggly lawn being fixed up. The shelter had to go due to the vast=
  teeming population of human traffickers=2C panhandlers=2C drunks=2C crack=
heads and hos who would sit there smoking on the bench sheltered from the w=
eather or spend hours motionlessly  propped  against the  grimy graffiti sl=
ashed glass on its crumpling  frame=2C whispering in the voice that goes st=
raight to the nervous system=2C with no need of an ear--"you straight?"


Since last mid-summer the new police chief has declared our area=2C known f=
orever as "Crack Alley=2C" to be his first order of business to clean up. I=
t's not the most violent area in the city=2C but one of the most concentrat=
ed in terms of dope and prostitution.    A lot of buildings next door all a=
long our block are closed down and being cleaned up=2C as they were filled =
with crack hos and dope dealers=2C and a continual stream of events such as=
 at the several days running big TV story on the news about a kidnapped bab=
y from next door an incident like any other=2C  squeezed in among some colo=
rful shootings and knifing incidents=2C not to mention the day a man with a=
n AK-47 used our building and the parking lot next to it for target practic=
e=2C blowing off chunks of the roof and managing to get some mega bullets t=
hrough air vents and hitting a resident here in the leg. The second the dud=
e opened fire=2C one knew it was some different kind of weapon=2C and dove =
for the floor as bullets chipped off almost the entire the window ledge=2C =
bit hungrily away at the bricks just below it=2C before a quick spurt of so=
und sent  a huge piece of the roof floating dreamily down past the window=
=2C  like a very relaxed  whale diving deep deep down in the otherwise plea=
sant evening. Al one knew was that what seemed like eons later there was a =
huge thud and the walls shook as the big piece of mortared concrete hit the=
 ground.


Al this has gradually been tamed down and now fewer prostitutes hawk their =
wares along the sidewalks and at the bus stops=2C though the ones still her=
e are the most persistent and bold ones.  They can easily handle a cop with=
 a patter so fast that it seems not to end=2C but simply to have generated =
a continuously playing loop of its own echoed messages--while Sistah beats =
her wings and takes flight=2C soaring over rooftops and vanishing into a va=
cant lot somewhere blocks away.  Hey shugah-- lets have us party . . .c'mon=
 now--ain't gonna bite it off-- One time a woman whom I had seen and talked=
 to a number of times=2C came up in a raging blizzard and begged me to go a=
round the building to the back steps and "suck you like heaven." She was so=
 desperate she was down on her knees in the snow bank.   It was below zero =
and almost no visibility--and she had on just a thin skirt and jacket--she =
had an "auntie" near by so got her there and gave her enough for a few rock=
s=2C one of the few times ii had money on me in awhile--

     There are women out who are homeless and who knows where they go--some=
 can't get into the shelters due to the dope--their families won't let them=
 in for fear of being robbed--sometimes the police pick them up and put the=
m in the jail so they wont die--Very few of the crack hos work for anyone b=
ut themselves--too erratic to work for a pimp--they are so desperate at tim=
es people will slip them a few bills--


Around three in the morning most nights--the Zombies emerge--drifting along=
 as though only the air they lean against is holding them upright--moving s=
low and stumblingly like the Living Dead of George Romero's films.  Some of=
 these eerie figures begin emitting high keening sounds=2C extremely painfu=
l to hear--the voices of desperation cutting the air into shreds--people su=
ddenly crumpling on the grass patches or falling down in a side walk gutter=
--In such bad shape they can't sell a thing to anyone--


It's excruciating to see and hear some nights those figures with the eerie =
phosphorescent death glows=2C auras of the grave and white powders and rock=
s--to look at these death bound ghosts and see oneself stumbling in the nig=
ht---through  dim jerky memories of another being one once was---somewhere =
in a war zone--miraculously surviving seizures and comas=2C blackouts=2C th=
e disappearance for a time of any sense of life--a black inert presence has=
 one seemingly wedged between life and death--one can't move--yes--there go=
es one now--a person suddenly transfixed before going through a spastic imi=
tation of a Crucifixion of themselves--seizures--thrashings--


As the economy goes down the toilet=2C so do the places for help start to v=
anish=2C become ever fewer--and some hospitals actually will turn away peop=
le they think will never pay --no insurance=2C nothing--

The whole health care system is eugenics against the poor and "unneeded"--


How many dope fiends=2C how many prostitutes=2C runaways=2C impressed into =
service young women--wind up anonymously dead=2C the notations along the wa=
y of the repetitions of a serial killer--and then another one and another--=
how many dead women have you seen?--no ID and lying in the road late at nig=
ht--flashlight lit as some cops try to make sense of a murder scene so biza=
rre the details cannot be released to the press? Or other scenes that one c=
annot get out of the mind--as well as ones one has only heard about--let al=
one lived through--


And yet none of these women were anonymous beings--many of them many people=
 knew--remembered--loved--brought up--many around here one speaks with many=
 times a week--

This is why much of this discussion to me is like an objectification of the=
 very beings that the protests about objectification are being made in the =
name of. =20


My first memories of prostitutes was being offered a  job in a fancy whoreh=
ouse that catered to an American clientele of the old school--Texas oil men=
=2C business men on the loose in Gay Paree--the woman who hired me was a so=
rt of second in command Madame--i don't recall how i met here--but she need=
ed a translator for a week while the regular one was on a vacation--so i sp=
ent day or night shifts translating back and forth=2C making introduction i=
n the swank Western Saloon style room where introductions were exchanged an=
d various other matters sorted out--I was 16 at the time and sleeping in st=
reets and abandoned houses and cars=2C so some extra money and free meals w=
as a great boost in the world for me--trhe Madame said=2C well=2C young man=
 you can pass for 20--that's old enough--


The workers in the brothel were not allowed to go out with each other--as t=
here were other men who worked there=2C cooking=2C cleaning=2C doing dishes=
 and laundry--and doubling as bouncers and security guards if there was eve=
r any problems at all--


The women were al in a union and once month the government inspectors came =
to check everyone for diseases=2C and make sure the place was as clean as p=
ossible=2C and the behaviour of everyone was in line. The idea being that l=
egalized and unionized prostitution gives rights and protection to the pros=
titutes they otherwise do not have at all=2C as here in the land of the fre=
e.=20


When there was a time for our breaks=2C whoever was around would get togeth=
er and go to a cafe or sit in the kitchen and drink bocks and coffee. Lots =
gossiping and card playing and showing about of pictures of children=2C fia=
ncees=2C husbands=2C boy friends.  Then back to work.


Since then I've known a lot of prostitutes as friends or neighbors and ther=
e is always different yet somewhat a same story involved. =20

People say "prostitute" like it is someone filthy and low--but look at the =
high class cal girls so called=2C who get politicians in trouble=2C or for =
that matter the movie stars who charge huge amounts for the fotos of their =
babies or their bikini clad frolics with some ex-lover.


And how much did the American public pay for the election--a billion dollar=
s!!--How many people did the President sell himself to to get to the Oval O=
ffice--

How much of one's soul did one sell out for a step up the career ladder--or=
 poem in a journal--or a name on the door like a Bigelow on the floor--


How much of life is not a form of prostitution=2C--though perhaps without t=
he dangers and horrors the street level and sex slave trades=2C which buy u=
p children for the uses of perverts with immense bankrolls--
or just tourists passing through on the way to see Junior's basketball game=
--


There is far more prostitution at every level than one would imagine=2C unt=
il one has seen how many things work=2C with the paying of cash for appeara=
nces=2Chiring someone to take along--and then--

And though people are angered --who is working to change things?  In one of=
 the five sections of Roberto Bolano's novel 2666--there are the relentless=
ly presented murders after murders with rapes and tortures recounted that h=
appened the area just over the American border--al these are young girls wh=
o work also in the factories--not prostitutes at all--but suddenly swooped =
on and turned into a ritualized thing--a doll=2C an object to be taken apar=
t and then covered back up=2C with the neat clean clothes paced over the cu=
t and violated body--


Imagine the Black Dahlia multiplied bya thousand--and al based on true hapn=
ings --

These murderers of anonymous and known and named women--are like the serial=
 killer and anonymously butchered bodies found al over the USA--and al the =
battered women=2C the addicted women=2C the homeless the insane--


Years of sitting and talking=2Changing out--and learning of these lives--is=
 how one sees this not just as "objectification" in the sense of "the male =
gaze" but of society's gaze--which doesn't see a person=2C but only reads t=
he label--"prostitute"--


So that objectification carries even into the critics of objectification=2C=
 for they themselves are not seeing a person=2C but only a label=2C a categ=
ory--

Or=2C at the Poetry Brothel=2C a Camp performance of something out of Cabar=
et--


What can one say other than that this is a disposable society and culture?-=
-  The inner cities are pumped full of crack by the CIA to destroy communit=
ies=2C enslave people to addiction=2C destroy generations of men and women=
=2C break up families--one looks around and sees the  holocaust unfolding d=
aily--


and no one will do anything about it--there's way too much money involved=
=2C way too much to be milked out of Colombia and Afghanistan for the Ameri=
can ends of these hook ups--

Pumping Grade A US Certified  killer heroin into the suburbs--the most kick=
 ass and deadly heroin ever known  to be in this country--killing scores of=
 users young and old--(very rarely do old users overdose--and now they are =
by untold numbers--dropping like flies)


The unending Wars=2C straight out of Orwell's 1984--War on Poverty--War on =
Drugs--War on Terror--

Think of the trillions that have been pumped into he War Machine--into the =
genocide of Iraq--and the "Right War" President Obama has in mind for Afgha=
nistan and  parts of Pakistan--not to mention the immense funding that this=
 country spends on Apartheid=2C while feeling so proud for electing a Black=
 president--we support the most vicious Apartheid regime there has been--


What does that kind of hypocrisy tel one? =20

Right there its say it all--neither we nor our allies believe one whit in d=
emocracy and equality--what we embrace mightily and pump billions and trill=
ions into is the establishment for eternity of Exceptionalism and Racial su=
premacy--


This is why i think that the "objectification" halts at the word itself and=
 does not go further--into those unpredictable areas where "prostitutes" ar=
e no longer objects but actual persons--


At an American  Indian group the other night people were saying with grief =
and shock and rage how horrified they were by the killing in Gaza--because =
for decades its a repeat of the land theft cultural destruction and genocid=
e of the Indigenous peoples in America=2C now paid for and supplied by the =
mega mega tons  overseas.


One man said--that's us they're killing all over again--why else does the U=
S allow this to go on other than that they obviously must approve of it--ki=
lling and segregation=2C prison camps- hells on earth--the Trail of Tears--=
the Apartheid Walls --Sieges--and the same old double talk to make it be co=
vered up=3D--to make it all look nice and pretty and hide the blood and muc=
k away


in a way isn't that what the Poetry Brothel is al about--making the actual =
"selling of poems" and "poets performances" far more "attractive" and "exci=
ting"--"stimulating"--


than the usual boring read before a boring backdrop in a boring room --=20
now instead of the dullness and no stimulation=2C no matter what the poems =
are like--who cares anyway!--a good time and eats and drinks will be had by=
 all--


as they say in the restaurant business=2C its not what they eat that matter=
s but how good you make it look for them --that really whets the appetite
and seals the deal--
think of how many art and poetry  movements after al started in cabarets an=
d clubs=2C bars--cellars--Dada--Punk--the scenes from Fellini's Satyricon w=
hich he called a science fiction film set int he past



of "futurist" Latin poets reciting=2C or that is=2C having their paid recit=
ers recite--their verses and deadly clever epigrams which just be made into=
 actual deaths
in a new and novel and very clever fashion--

mush like the shaping of verses in an exquisitely honed new form=2C so are =
the creative variations and inventions which the poet executioner brings ab=
out=2C realized in aa
action event performance from=20
a Score of ingenious and fractal dice throwing chance operations--

which never abolish chance--

played upon the actual "backbone Flute" of Mayakovsky whose Russian Futuris=
m has likewise landed in the past--ready and willing to compete with Marine=
tti's in the arenas--


of blood dust and glory--
--
 think though that sooner or later the next steps will be taken and the poe=
try and the brothel will be raised to ever higher scales and skills and so =
the REAL money can start to roll in!


meaning--no more amateurs!--and then the Real Pros will start to roll in--

buy the poet and have he or she give not only the poem but themselves to yo=
u!!
and then autograph you!!
or a nice foto of the two of you in flagrante delecto!!


why do it for free anyway--
how tedious and unexciting!
it can be like the Visconti short film in which Romy Schneider discovers he=
r husband is only really attracted to her when she makes him pay--

isn't that why we like our wars so much=2C because we have to pay and pay a=
nd pay

for drugs and wars and poverty being spread far and wide by the massive spe=
nding on wars--

aren't these the ultimate Brothels--the porno of watching helpless peoples =
be bombed and starved tortured cut off from medications and food water and =
electricity in the winter cold--and phosphorous and cluster bombed to death=
 by the hundreds and thousands--


isn't this what we really paid for--
the ultimate Snuff Films set in the vast desolation--
the annihilation of a people --

"until not one stone shall be left on another"
and what is next on the menu=2C what can possibly top this--

the "Right War?"--the torching of every single moving being in Afghanistan-=
-of parts of Pakistan=20
and then on to Iran--at last!!--

and since no media is allowed to record anything as it happens
what great fun al national poets can have in suturing together the reams of=
 Army footage and propaganda to produce the ultimate epic--


the Brothel to end al Brothels----where the Snuff films play to the tinklin=
g of subdued piano music and someone is reading a very radical and innovati=
ve poem

and after the audience has been softened up so to speak--


as is conjectured in the Bolano story from the heinous realities--
income the kidnapped and drugged runaways the over the hill hookers--the to=
o addicted to function anymore--or simply the cutest little teenage  girls =
and/or boys  you have ever seen--

and right there in front of one=2C no longer a film--

but the Reality Show of Death--LIVE!!!

now ladies and gentlemen isn't that what we are really paying for--
admission to the ultimate Show!!

looking out the window here one can see it --the ultimate show--the death r=
attles and violent seizures--


the grip of crack on a ho's neck and her windpipe shutting down --

let's see what kind of verses can be made to accompany those sounds--

overdubbed or done LIVE
and right here and now before a video camera and mic

why not--
to watch oneself watch the death of another--
and then film that in turn until an endless hall of mirrors is made--of ima=
ges of oneself watching another's death--murder-mutilation and violation---=
-

the ultimate brothel poetry show--
as one's voice in the voice over is reciting the latest innovative style of=
 radical poetry--
and--
a complete circuitry of onanism is accomplished--and recorded for the payin=
g audience=2C the hottest thing going in the brothel charnal house of poetr=
y

in the land of a thousand dances of death--

the deaths individual and lonely and those public and many--
the gleaming drones and fighter jets their ways lit by illegal use of phosp=
horous illuminating the bursting into flames and blood of a family=2C an ol=
d woman--

walls blown asunder to reveal--nothing--
nothing had been there al along
except--the skin of a long departed onion
pale and translucent in the light of the spreading infernos--
as bodies already burned through by phosphorous are ignited by the chemical=
 mixtures happening at lightning speed and transforming the veins into writ=
ing green vines that choke and tear the skeletons apart

and leave their grinning teeth lying their

deaths heads in the last views of a rape and snuff scene that is superimpos=
ed and then faded out--
as the bodies burn and skeletons disintegrate and the ground itself is heav=
ing=2C ion convulsions--

and then erupts and like Atlantis what is left of this place of the damned =
and doomed sinks forever out of sight

extinguished caught live on camera snuffed out--
forever--

though to be sure many captive females have bee hsutled off=2C saved to spe=
nd their lives serving in the brothels and live death cinemas--


of the new order--

the ultimate "Ending"--
why not--as it has all been bought and paid for
and might just be the most incredible new form of poems--
the real Apocalypse--
snuffing out a culture


while  poets recite and sexual acts are performed ending in the Death of th=
e--not the Author--but--
that non person hauled into be slaughtered while everyone is aroused--

this is the ultimate destination hinted at and part way accomplished in Bol=
ano's Distant Star (Polaroids instead of moving pictures--) and realized in=
 real life in Chile and turned into paragraphs in By Night in Chile--


and eerily starting to become realized in new ways still unfolding--
in the emergence of the new extreme experimental American poetry--

and there sitting before one the Manet images-of prostitutes -turning in to=
 scenes from Goya--


  . . . .  . . Hardly ever any more does one look out a window on one side =
of the building and see sexual transactions going on between the wall and t=
he dumpsters.   Or in the back of the building=2C in a an area the stairway=
 that's now too lit up for the old action to continue. Sex is very cheap--a=
 couple bucks=2C five=2C ten--enough to get the next couple rocks of crack =
or a four pack of malt liquor. A lot of the time people are high and just w=
ant to talk with you and have a cigarette and feel like they are carrying o=
n a "normal conversation." And why not--just about everyone now and then wo=
uld like to feel if even for the course of smoking a cigarette like  a "nor=
mal person."

I think most of what you say here is wonderful.=A0 Personal attacks are def=
initely the line people should not cross in a poetry workshop.=A0 Construct=
ive criticism is what poetry workshops are about and appreciation when some=
thing is really good.=A0 I start each workshop I teach by telling the stude=
nts that we are all equals.=A0 I may or may not know a bit more about poetr=
y than they do but, as human beings, we are all equals and that they are al=
lowed to disagree with anything I say if they do so.=A0 I think this helps =
to neutralize not only the hierarchy of the class but also the odd sense of=
 "empowerment" some people feel who have studied at many workshops and thus=
 feel they have the right or the opportunity to make personal attacks.=A0 O=
f course, if a young poet feels his work is so perfect, so sacrosanct that =
no one should criticize it, then what is he or she doing in a workshop anyw=
ay.=A0 But it sounds like this is another issue from what you are talking
 about here.=A0 Regards, Tom Savage

Thank you! The images are somewhat old I think - the 'matrix' is much more
complex at the moment, perhaps less jewel-like. If anyone wants to follow
the development of all of this, go to http://www.alansondheim.org and then
click _twice_ on "Last Modified" - this brings the recent images/videos/
to the top of the directory (click once and the oldest files are at the
top). For descriptions, click on the first .txt file - which at the moment
is "py.txt" - the newest material is at the bottom.

That's about it and again thanks!

- Alan

Whiskey & Fox's most recent print issue (the last of our very tiny and
hastily made editions), Vol. 2 No. 2, May 2008, "Fashion," is now available
electronically.  For free, of course, on our website at
http://whiskeyandfox.blogspot.com . "Fashion" features work from Toma=9E
=8Aalamun, Thomas Kane, Kelly Ramsey, Sarah Bagley, Julie Granum, Robin
Clarke, Sten Carlson, Emily Gropp, Daniel C. Remein, and Joshua Zelesnick.

Additionally,
I do think a good deal of the POETICS community will be interested in this
journal, its politics, its publications, etc--as readers and contributors.
If you haven't yet made your way over there, give it a look around,
http://whiskeyandfox.blogspot.com .  There is still a current call for
submissions for the next issue, "Doing Politics with Animals," our first
all-electronic larger-scale production.

Cheers

Does it have to be about competition?

I teach theatre as well as having taught writing on occasion.  The thing
about theatre and performance is that you HAVE to make mistakes in front =
of
other people in order to get better and so for me, it's important to =
create
a laboratory environment where it's assumed that you'll make some =
"mistakes"
and that some things will work better than other. Using the laboratory
analogy, scientists don't assume that every experiment will produce =
expected
or predictable results. That's the point--to try things and see how they
work. =20

With peer review of any kind of work, that's what I try to focus =
on--what
worked or didn't work and why, keeping in mind that peer review is still =
as
much about developing the skills of the reviewer as the person being
reviewed, whether grad or undergrad students.  What elements drew your
attention?  Where were things unclear?  And also to ask the performing =
(or
writing) students what their own goals were so that the work can be
evaluated in those terms. Maybe they're ok with some things being =
open-ended
or unclear, for example.  Maybe some of the things that disturb their =
peers
structurally are intended to disturb or annoy.  Maybe there's a =
legitimate
goal there.  Or, maybe the work is truly muddled or clich=E9d or maybe =
the
work has all the elements it needs but still doesn't come together and =
needs
a monkeywrench.  The point of a workshop should be to help the artist =
get to
clarity about what they've done, not even to critique or compare =
yourselves
to one another.

I have a friend who does experimental writing and has a very hard time =
in
workshops because her writing is so different than what many of the =
other
students do.  But it shouldn't be about personal taste, even though =
writing
is definitely subjective. =20

There's something to be said for instructors setting a tone that =
encourages
students to open their minds to other types of writing than their own, =
other
types of writing than what they personally like or think is "good" and =
to
consider that each writer may have his or her own objectives to what =
they
write.  Having some regular readings that encourage students to open up =
to
other types of writing, as well as the writing assignments themselves, =
can
also help with that.  It seems to me that the instructor needs to keep a
handle on all of that.  But again, I don't see where it has to be a
competition at all, personally.

Subject: coMpetition does

Recently I've met a couple of young poets (yet again) who dropped out
of poetry writing workshops because they were, in the words of one of
these poets, "eaten alive."

The conversation isn't new.  And it's not a conversation about
workshops in particular, but competition in a bigger sense.

When is competition good, meaning productive, meaning THE THING which
spurs poets into action in the best sense, in the sense of WANTING to
write as well as they can.

And when is competition ugly, filled with envy and jealousy, reaching
a surprising number of times in my observations to the most corrupt,
wicked, disturbing places people can get to.

The conversation is tricky because I'm always trying to ask,
investigate with others, WHERE IS THE line between competition when
it's healthy, and rotten?

There's no doubt in my mind that these two young poets (the latest two
that is, as I've been having this conversation for years now and I
don't even remember how many times I've had it frankly) love, really
LOVE poetry.  We share that, we find when talking that we share that
DRIVE, depositing ourselves in front of bookstore poetry sections, and
libraries, and asking everyone we know who their favorite poets are,
and titles, and never getting enough of this love.  Never getting
enough of it.  And not just feeling sad when a bookstore like GOTHAM
BOOKMART closes down but ANGRY!

We're so much alike, and we tell one another what we're most excited
about NOW, and everyone's scratching notes for the library and
bookstore.  How we're NOT alike is that these two young poets are VERY
vulnerable to attack.  When they were said to be "eaten alive" I'm not
surprised.  And I'm sad, and wish they were MORE LIKE ME and laugh at
the bastards and say, "OH YOU'RE JUST A HATER, YOU JEALOUS PIG!"  Or,
"Yeah well, THANKS, being attacked GETS ME UP IN THE MORNING TO MAKE
YOU ANGRY!"  It feeds me when someone attacks me, I LOVE it.

But of course a lot of people don't respond well when they're
attacked, and this makes me sad.  I've known poets WHOSE POEMS MADE ME
HAPPY who stopped writing poems because of such attacks.  In some
cases the attacks were from their professors, and the other students,
egged-on by the professors.  A FEEDING FRENZY in such a way that makes
me want to puke for poetry.  It disgusts me this kind of behavior.

I'm not a professor, but I have conducted poetry workshops, and it's
NOT HARD AT ALL in my opinion to keep the focus about everyone
(including myself because I want to learn from THEM TOO!)
investigating poetry together!  My focus is about PROCESS, about the
many weird ways to MAKE poetry happen, NOT ABOUT who is writing poems
I think are good, or another person in the workshop thinks are good,
or not.

This is NOT goody-two-shoe bullshit, I'm JUST NOT INTERESTED in
telling someone whether I like their poems or not when I'm conducting
workshops.  And it's none of my business frankly.  But to LOVE poetry,
and read it, and create it, and have it in our lives, now THAT is
something I get very excited about!

But what is that line?  When is it crossed from productive and
beautiful and everyone's excited and MAKING poetry, to that place of
shit?

I'd rather see poems ABOUT that dark spot on the poetry map, than see
it overwhelm another poet.  And I mean overwhelm the poet who NEEDS to
be vicious, and of course I mean the poet who gets beaten down.

This conversation cannot happen unless we talk about the bigger things
around it, like, WHY IS EVERYONE NOT UNDERSTANDING EVERYONE IS
CREATIVE WE ARE ALL CREATIVE THIS IS NOT UP FOR DEBATE.  Or is it?
I've had people tell me this is wrong, that everyone's NOT creative.
But I disagree.

And the conversation needs to be about how the way poets act about
scarcity and fear that there's not enough NOT ENOUGH magazines NOT
ENOUGH awards or enough room at the reading series, not enough, is
really, such an old story about us being animals.

And the conversation needs to be about how to protect ourselves if we
can't withstand the attacks.

And the conversation needs to be about how people don't need to attack
others because THERE IS ENOUGH.

And the conversation needs to be about how art and all our creative
abilities have become part of a big system in the capital of art and
poetry, and books, and writing programs and teaching and, and, and
CONSUMPTION, and frankly how, more than ever there's more reasons than
ever for us to feel like we're NOT working hard enough, NOT being good
enough, NOT good enough, so many reasons to feel like shit.

It's a big conversation.  But I feel I'm always having it.  And it's
one of the most important ones to have some days, especially when I
meet young poets who have just been destroyed in workshops, made to
feel worthless.  The one poet started crying, and said, literally
between sobs, "ALL I WANT TO DO IS WRITE POETRY!"  It's really awful,
I just want to hit whoever did this to this person, but of course
that's not helpful.

The line crossed is hard to see because it's different for everyone, I
think.  Right?  Sometimes I'm not sure I'm right about that, but it
feels right, doesn't just feel like an answer I've come up with to
forget thinking about it, because I really want to figure it out, if
it can be figured out.  There's too much at stake, at least it feels
that way when I meet YET ANOTHER amazing young poet who becomes afraid
of workshops and other poets and stops writing.

I've met so many amazing poets who stop, for so many reasons they
stop.  The most common reason though is that they get worn out from
the struggle of dealing with many hungry egos.  And their own hungry
ego.  It goes back to the discussion about why we're writing, and what
has writing become in this world for us?

The problem with the workshop system is that you are you and not the writer.
When you workshop someone else's work, you see it through your eyes. The
most destructive crits come from those who fail to meet the work of others
on its own terms...but to reduce this discussion to a simple binary, that
"all workshops are bad," is absurd.

I'm trying to recall the name of the French poet who referred to his poems
as "promes"?

Hello everyone,

I am so very sorry for this major inconvenience.  My computer died and took
the Blackbox winter gallery submissions with it.  I had similar trouble once
before, but at that time I was able to repair the machine.  This time, however,
the old horse gave up, permanently.

With the holidays, gall bladder surgery, plus periodontal work, I have just
now been able to replace the computer.  May I ask those who submitted work to
resubmit so that the winter gallery can become a reality?

Again, my sincerest apologies for this mess.

Best, Bill (William James Austin)

Richard Hugo House, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization located in Seattle,=
=0AWashington, is seeking a full-time executive director.=0AAbout Richard H=
ugo House=0AThe vision for Hugo House was conceived around a kitchen table =
by three smart women=97an emblematic beginning for an organization that pri=
des itself on creativity and intelligence without pretention. Eleven years =
later, the ethos hasn=92t changed=97we present world-class literary program=
ming within the well lived-in (some might say =93funky=94) walls of a comfo=
rtable Victorian House.=0AOur mission is to promote the literary arts as a =
vital part of our culture and community. We provide writers of all ages and=
 backgrounds with the resources they need, connect audiences with the world=
 of writing, and foster the creation of new work. At Hugo House we believe =
that the impulse to imagine and create is innate and powerful, and we are m=
otivated by the overarching convictions that literature does matter, that i=
deas can change the world, and that nurturing writers is the most important=
 work we can do.=0ATo this end we offer classes, residencies and events tha=
t reflect the broad interests of our community as well as the wide spectrum=
 of forms and genres that exist in the literary arts.=0A=95 Our classes are=
 taught by well regarded professional writers and teachers, and cover the g=
amut from reading classes on the classics, to writing workshops on anything=
 from ekphrasic poetry to spoken word to full-length memoirs. We also offer=
 a number of vibrant programs for youth.=0A=95 We are dedicated to promotin=
g the careers of local writers through residencies that provide stipends, t=
eaching opportunities and incentives to produce their own. We also offer gr=
anting programs such as The Writers Fund, which provides co-sponsorships to=
 individuals and groups to produce their own events=97anything from a book =
launch party to a staged reading of a new play in our Cabaret space.=0A=95 =
Through events such as the Hugo Literary Series, we commission both local a=
uthors and those with national reputations, such as Tim O=92Brien, Rick Moo=
dy, Marie Howe, Sherman Alexie and Pam Houston, to create original work; we=
 offer local audiences the opportunity to interact with the writers through=
 readings and classes.=0ALike the building in which we are located, the Hug=
o House staff is unpretentious and a little eccentric. We take the work we =
do and the community we serve very seriously, but not ourselves. We are pro=
ne to strong coffee, irreverent humor and passionate opinions about everyth=
ing, especially literature. We appreciate teamwork but don=92t relish hiera=
rchy. We are good at our jobs and respect competence in others. We host ama=
zing events and gatherings. We like to think this is the kind of place Rich=
ard Hugo would have come to.=0AFor additional information about the organiz=

Being eaten alive in a workshop isn't a bad thing. If you can't stand
criticism of your work, you won't improve much as an artist. This isn't
to say that everything in a workshop is golden (it isn't), but you come out
with many perspectives and, if you know what you're really hearing, you can
figure out what's really wrong that needs work among the comments and
criticisms. But CA is right, you do have to be careful to distinguish betwe=
en
those who wish to help you, and those who are envious and want to tear you =
down,
to "get rid of the competition." Again, if you're paying
attention, it does become pretty obvious before long. Be on the lookout for
those who come up to you later and apologize for "being so rough"
and/or who offer more suggestions or offer to look at it again after the
revision. Those are the ones who want to help you. They will also more like=
ly be
the good poets. Nasty, antisocial, selfish people do not have the wisdom
necessary to be
 great poets. Or even good or mediocre poets.

Yes, Steve, it's everywhere as others have also remarked. What puzzled
me was this statement:

"Contemporary urban poets have moved away from Wordsworth and the
Romantics, whose metaphors were shaped by sublime natural forces,
whose rhythms were so often set by the cycles of nature. The newer
language of art emanates from the human-built environment, from the
streets, from computers. This urban or electronic expression of
creativity speaks to and for modern ears and eyes, and it has its own
rhythms and metaphors."  (Last Child In The Woods...Richard Louv)

Experts in one field often feel qualified to make uninformed comments
regarding other fields. It's obvious there are environments of poetry
he's never dared to wander.

Sometimes it is better to lock one's doors and throw away the keys, even
when there's nothing of great value in the house.

what a great response!
but if one is inside the house, does it make one one's own prisoner?

Indeed, I think is especially pronounced with poetry. EVERYONE seems to
think they are qualified to make comments on it--what's wrong with it, why
they don't read it, etc.

Let's consider Sappho:

Parthenia, parthenia,
poi me lipois' apoikhe?

Translated by Guy Davenport as:

Girlhood O girlhood
Lost of a sudden,
Where have you gone?

Mary Barnard translates "Parthenia" as "Maidenhead."  This is probably a fragment of an epithalamium and there is a certain degree of chaffing going on here: how insubstantial, after all, is this "maidenhead"!  Tne joking tone remains in the response of the bridegroom (both voices were probably enacted by Sappho's girl pupils, though bear in mind we know very little about Sappho):

Ouketi exo
pros se
ouket'exo

Translated by Davenport as:

Nowhere, bride my darling
Nowhere near you

We're a long way from chastity belts (with thrown-away keys) and extolling of virginity!

The more conscious you become - of anything - the larger the house gets to
be.  Of course, the first thing to go is, a way to find the door.  It always
gets more distant.  And THAT is consciousness . . . that we're ALL "one's
own prisoner."  In one's own Self.  It goes with the territory.  If
territory is what one's buying.

EKS, very funny. Where do we draw the line, as the saying goes. What's an a=
dage, what's cliche, what's art, what's copyrighted, what's free? What's th=
eir point? Who said what? What's attributed to whom, and when and why? Did =
George chop down that cherry tree or was it a frame? Who invented letters, =
words? Who invented rock and roll? Music, art & lit are in this together. C=
opy-cats are everywhere. Only vampires and God know the origins and origina=
tors. Any way, I've decided that it's the sum of the whole that matters in =
any work (of art). Phrases borrowed and unattributed I guess are okay as lo=
ng as the real or first writer isn't Poed. Though an IQ test score next to =
any author's byline might be a bright idea.=20

Bio:

DanCoyote Antonelli:

The avatar DanCoyote was created as the proxy for David =93DC=94 Spensley i=
n the=20
virtual world of Second Life. The name DanCoyote is derived from Cervantes=
=92 Don=20
Quixote and in honor of a coyote that Joseph Beuys lived with for a time at=
 the=20
Ren=E9 Block Gallery in New York during his 1974 action, =93I like America =
and=20
America Likes Me=94.

DanCoyote=92s costume is intended to be simple and low bandwidth, placing t=
he=20
emphasis on work outside of the avatar. Each detail of DanCoyote=92s garb,=
=20
however, has significance. Yellow and black are high visibility colors and =
also=20
the official colors of the City of San Francisco. The gold bands on his arm=
s=20
and legs symbolize a release from the bonds of gravity and physicality. The=
=20
wand in the left hand is called a =93caduceus=94, which refers to the=20
transformational nature of the Greek god Hermes. Caduceus .03 is also a one=
 of=20
a kind virtual tool, custom programmed to project commands to metamorphosiz=
e=20
objects and installations from a distance.

DC Spensley

An alumni of the San Francisco Art Institute, DC Spensley has lived and wor=
ked=20
in Northern California since 1986. Spensley wears the hat of writer, direct=
or,=20
cinematographer, composer, performance artist and most recently has appeare=
d as=20
the avatar DanCoyote Antonelli in the virtual reality simulation of Second=
=20
Life. While most people jealously guard their pseudonymity inside this=20
alternate reality, Spensley attempts parity in both worlds and has exhibite=
d=20
internationally at the ZeroOne/ISEA conference in 2006, the Dutch Electroni=
c=20
Arts Festival 2006 and Ars Electronica 2007.

About the work on exhibition at ARENA:

I call this grouping "Recent Retrospective" because it contains art from=20
different bodies of my work done in the last three years as an artist in=20
residence in the virtual world.

Most prominent is the nearly kilometer tall assembly entitled "Drawing".=20
Drawing is neither a drawing or a sculpture, but is rather a conceptual ton=
gue=20
and cheek reference to both kinds of artifact that ironically cannot exist =
in=20
simulated space. Drawing informs viewers about scale in the virtual world i=
n a=20
way unlike most constructions found in SL by negating the figurative contex=
t=20
and pointing out the "avatar powers" of a viewer. This encourages a viewer =
to=20
become more aware of their configuration options and invites the viewer rea=
lize=20
a new level of proficiency in experiencing simulated space. The mute monoli=
ths=20
animate glacially, too slow for the eye to perceive and foreground a sense =
of=20
the volume of space displaced by the work. Viewers take a chair conveyance=
=20
available at the "Drawing" sign which carries them up to a vantage point hi=
gh=20
about the sim.

Also on display:

"Pixel Board", a binary feedback social sculpture. Viewers click squares on=
 the=20
smaller panel and this input appears as output on the larger display, which=
 is=20
then visible from a great distance. Pixel Board explores the social urge to=
=20
leave graffiti, but in a one-bit, black and white icon format.

"Mutant Hossies". These three weird quasi-horse artworks are remediations o=
f a=20
classic sculptural form and displayed like bronze statues on marble platfor=
ms.=20
They are a "mashup", or reworking of an original horse sculpture give away =
free=20
by Second Life artist Nomasha Syaks. Mutant Hossies have embedded scripting=
=20
that causes subtle animations to play that support the fanciful variation o=
f=20
horse depicted.

"Tomb Maze" Tomb Maze uses embedded reflexive scripting to create a tomb-li=
ke=20
maze that people are encouraged to navigate their avatar through. The maze =
is=20
possible. It does take some patience, so there is always the chance an=20
impatient avatar might become trapped and need to find other means of escap=
e!

"Very Silly Militude" is not what it seems. Very Silly Militude characteriz=
es=20
the quality of verissimilitude superficially. But when set to midnight, a=
=20
viewer walking through will see light cast in unusual ways. The exterior la=
yer=20
of the work is a deliberate misdirection and while it appears to be about t=
he=20
movement of heavy objects in space, it is really about the way light is=20
occluded by them.

Thanks for viewing!

David "DC" Spensley is DanCoyote in SL



Concurrent with the New Media Caucus panel Space: The New Frontier at the=
=20
National CAA 2009, =93@=94 is an exhibition that examines space and site.

With simultaneous locations in Los Angeles and Second Life (SL), =93@=94cha=
llenges=20
artists to consider place & placelessness from within the context of networ=
ked=20
culture.

The physical gallery space will be replicated within SL, featuring an actua=
l=20
window between the virtual and real worlds to observe and be observed.

The exhibition space will feature a floor-to-ceiling projection and a strea=
ming=20
video camera.  This wall will serve as the interface between the Real Life =
(RL)=20
in the gallery and its replication in Second Life.

The intent for =93@=94 is to exploit the philosophically rich mirroring bet=
ween RL=20
and SL, as well as the paradoxical condition of being the observer and=20
observed.

CALL FOR WORKS:

Three aspects to the show will be curated separately but are expected to=20
connect conceptually:

1) installation in RL: a heterotopic space - "other space" or "alt space"=
=96 that=20
contains the projection from SL and that can be modeled in SL.  The artist =
is=20
not responsible for creating the SL model.

2) video  screenings:   works concerning space and place vis-=E0-vis RL and=
 SL.=20
These works will be screened in an adjacent space in RL and streamed in SL

3) works based in SL that may cross RL boundaries. Objects and performances=
=20
originating in SL that consider and make use of the synergistic interplay o=
f=20
RL/SL localities. Work may exist in either or both spaces.

Exhibition site: Southern California Institute of Architecture, Los Angeles=
,=20
CA, and Seventh Eye in Second Life.

Installation will take place at the end of February

Formats:

- Works may be in any medium. ( submissions must be web links)
- Physical works MAY be reproduced in the SL space.
- Please consider the exhibition context and propose new and existing works=
=20
that fit this hybrid space.
- Links to high compression downloadable quicktime are recommended, suggest=
ed=20
length is 3-5 minutes.
- The gallery is approximately 20' x 60' (detailed diagram available upon=
=20
request)


Deadline: January 26

Please send proposals or documentation links to:
gallery@arsvirtua.com

Good for her. Natalie knows what she wants out of life. Better make the bucks the old fashion way than lose it at some drunken Frat party with an asshole, and that's what usually happens. Virginity has nothing to do with virtue.

what a great response!
but if one is inside the house, does it make one one's own prisoner?

HAVING IT BOTH WAYS: THE PROSE POEM =AD LARRY FAGIN
TUESDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 10TH
This is a workshop designed for writers of both poetry and short prose, who
are interested in investigating the boundary between the two areas, or thos=
e
who have discovered such boundaries to be less than trustworthy. We will
study this indeterminate form - its subtle musical passages, its rhythms,
its connections to narrative and vignette, and its recent incorporations of
disjunction and collage. We will read (Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Stein, Max
Jacob, Ponge, Ashbery, Bernadette Mayer, Lydia Davis, et al), exchange idea=
s
(story, description, image, abstraction, the personal) and refine our
writing with an eye toward publication. Weekly reading and writing
assignments. Also, three individual consultations for each participant,
throughout the ten weeks.

Larry Fagin is the author of 18 books, the most recent of which is Dig &
Delve, a collaboration with the artist Trevor Winkfield.


"THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS": WRITING POLITICAL POEMS =AD SPARROW
THURSDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 12TH
A poem is a weapon; the question is which way to point it. In "This Machine
Kills Fascists," we will study how the masters fought evil, and we'll teach
the masters a few tricks of our own. It's time to change the world, one lin=
e
at a time. (Incidentally, this workshop is open to Republicans and
free-market economists.) We will examine the works of Langston Hughes, Yoko
Ono, Woody Guthrie, Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, John Greenleaf Whittier,
Mahmoud Darwish, and more. And we will write!

Sparrow, author of America: A Prophesy, professor and Presidential
candidate, will lead this enclave.


THE FILMIC MUSE: WRITING MOVIE POEMS =AD JEFFERY CONWAY
FRIDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 13TH
Whether you're a movieholic, or just have a few movies you love,
transforming film into poetry is a great way to stretch and attenuate as a
writer. The workshop includes weekly readings of Frank O'Hara, Edward Field=
,
David Trinidad, Denise Duhamel, and Lynn Crosbie, among others, as well as
weekly writing exercises and opportunities to discuss your work. Some of th=
e
approaches we'll try: persona poems as a way of inhabiting film; creating
poems as scene-by-scene analysis or "poetic DVD commentary"; writing hybrid
poems which incorporate biography, trivia, film criticism, and technical
analysis.

Jeffery Conway's latest book is The Album That Changed My Life, a finalist
for the Lambda Literary Award.


PHENOLOGY AND POETRY =AD SUSIE TIMMONS
SATURDAYS AT NOON: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 14TH
Phenology =AD the study of the sequence and timing of events in the life
cycles of animals and plants as they respond to seasonal changes in
environment =AD is used by farmers and gardeners to know when to plant, when
to expect certain pests etc.; for example, "Don't plant corn before oak
leaves are the size of a squirrel's ear." We will use the practice of
phenology in conjunction with a series of exercises as a departure for
examining: the temporal scale of our work, the conundrum of cyclic change,
the potential for physical discomfort as a source of inspiration. Meetings
will consist of excursions (in close proximity to the Poetry Project)
regardless of weather conditions, methodically observing precise changes in
a preordained collection of sites as we go from the dead of winter into
early spring. If you think looking at twigs is stupid, this workshop is not
for you.

Susie Timmons is the author of Locked From the Outside (winner of the
inaugural Ted Berrigan Award).


The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one year Sustaining Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all spring and fall classes.
Reservations are required due to limited class space, and payment must be
received in advance. Caps on class sizes, if in effect, will be determined

Grad Student Selling Virginity Flooded With Offers

http://cbs13.com/local/selling.virginity.tuition.2.815171.html

A
Sacramento State grad trying to make money by auctioning off her
virginity to help pay for her graduate studies is getting lots of
offers...and not just for sex.

The 22-year-old who is using the
pseudonym Natalie Dylan for safety reasons is going through a legal
brothel in Nevada to sell her virginity. Dylan told CBS13 she's gotten
an offer of $250,000.=A0 And now she's gotten an offer to do a photo
spread for Penthouse magazine.

The auction is being handled by the Bunny Ranch in Carson City, Nevada with=
 bids coming in through their website.

Dylan says she's already taken a polygraph test to prove her virginal statu=
s, and is also willing to undergo a medical exam.

"The
main purpose of this is to finance a couple things in my life," Dylan
told CBS13.=A0 "I think empowerment of women is picking yourself up and
doing something on your own to better yourself."

So far,
hundreds of offers have already come in including some from male
virgins.=A0 Natalie says she won't give up her virginity to the highest
bidder.=A0 She's also seeking other qualities from her first lover. "I'm
looking for intelligence and an overall nice person," said Dylan.

Dylan
says she ended up in a financial bind, because her stepfather allegedly
used her college status to fraudulently apply for student loans, and
then ran off with the money.

Dylan earned her bachelor's degree
in women's studies from Sacramento State and plans to get her master's
at the school beginning in January.

Many Sac State students say they're shocked to hear about their former clas=
smate's plan, while others applaud her.

"She's
just giving it to some random person. And I just think she should be
giving it to someone special she loves," said one student on campus.

While another felt that selling her virginity for grad school "is a noble r=
eason to get money."

As
for Natalie, after claiming to hold on to her virginity for 22 years
(although the Bunny Ranch website claims she is 21-years-old), she says
she has a commodity not many people have to sell.

"When I was
younger, I wanted 100% romance, possibly even wait for marriage.=A0 But
as I grew up, reality kinda hit.=A0 And I think its a capitalistic
society and I want to capitalize on this," explained Dylan.

UNTITLED NEW YORK:  SPECULATIONS ON THE EXPANDED FIELD OF WRITING

Saturday, January 31st, 2009.  Panels: 1:30pm & Readings 8:30 pm
At CABINET, 300 Nevins St, Brooklyn, NY 11217
=93Untitled New York =94 is a day-long conversation about writing which =
in =20
some manner exceeds the printed page.   Organized by Matias Viegener =20
and Christine Wertheim, it assembles a notable group of experimental =20
writers to discuss the currently expanded and still-expanding field of =20=

writing that challenges assumptions about the nature of writing and =20
the potentials of text.  While we are familiar with visual artworks =20
constituted as a set of instructions, secrets written by visitors in a =20=

book, or one artist erasing of another artist's work, what would be =20
their equivalents in the literary world?

=93Untitled=94 is a common title of contemporary art works and also =
refers =20
to the incipient moment of a new text or idea; it was chosen to convey =20=

a sense of openness and process.  A variety of writers and artists =20
will discuss the use of language and words and/or their object status, =20=

the book and the letter, the question of the "emptiness" vs. the =20
fullness of language as a poetic medium, the pictorial versus the =20
narrative, the incorporation of extra-linguistic symbols and signs =20
(maps, diagrams, formulas, etc.), the question of conceptual writing, =20=

and words off the page =96 performed, sited, projected, incanted, or =20
invoked.

Among the participants is Kenny Goldsmith, an =93uncreative=94 writer =
who =20
labels himself the =93most boring writer in the world=94 and writes =
books =20
that include everything he said for a week (Soliloquy, 2001), every =20
move his body made during a thirteen-hour period (Fidget, 1999), and a =20=

year of transcribed weather reports (The Weather, 2005).  Working =20
through an interpolation of the English tongue, Christine Wertheim =20
(author of  +|'me'S-pace, 2007) deploys a litteral poetics, in which =20
words are not taken as arbitrary signs the writer may use as s/he sees =20=

fit, but as compounds with substance and structures and, literally, =20
meanings of their own.  The broken narrative of participant Shanxing =20
Wang=92s Mad Science in Imperial City escapes and invades the political =20=

turbulence of Tiananmen through math, mechanics, music, film, and by =20
dreams to create =93a work of art-in-language=94 (Lyn Hejinian).

The event will begin with two panels.  =93Appropriation and Citation=94 =20=

will look at the many practices of appropriation so popular in the =20
literary world in the last several years, asking questions about whose =20=

work and what material gets appropriated, cited or resurrected, who =20
owns texts, and if there is a difference between appropriation and =20
citation.  The participants include Vanessa Place, Steven McCaffrey, =20
Kenneth Goldsmith, and Julie Patton.

  =93Litterality,=94 examines how writers use what we normally consider =20=

non-linguistic elements, such as symbols, diagrams, maps, or scores =20
placed in the context of writing.  We will also look at invented =20
writing systems, and what it might mean to think about the book as an =20=

object rather than as a collection of words or sentences. Its =20
participants include Christine Wertheim, Latasha Diggs, and Shanxing =20
Wang.

In the evening, beginning at 8:30 there will be a reading of the =20
participants=92 own work.  =93Untitled New York=94 is a reprise of =20
=93Untitled: Speculations on the Expanded Field of Writing,=94 held in =20=

October 2008 at REDCAT in Los Angeles, organized by Matias Viegener =20
and Christine Wertheim of the Writing Program at CalArts, and funded =20
by The Annenberg Foundation.

WOIDS 'N AHT:
SPECULATIONS ON THE EXPANDED FIELD OF WRITING

MOCA, SUN JAN 25th 2pm
250 S  GRAND, LA CA 90012

WOIDS 'N AHT is a panel on the use of text in art or the relation =20
between words and art with three artists whose work intimately =20
involves writing and language.   While the literary world has moved =20
toward  more conceptual and material uses of language and writing, =20
artists have been working with and in language for close to fifty =20
years.  Topics may include the object status of the book and the =20
letter, the question of the "emptiness" vs. the fullness of language =20
as a medium, the pictorial vs. the narrative, the question of =20
conceptual writing, and words off the page =96 performed, sited, =20
projected, incanted, or invoked.  Moderated by Juli Carson and =20
organized by Matias Viegener and Christine Wertheim of the CalArts MFA =20=

 Certainly! And in many ways we imprison ourselves. Freeing myself from my own self-incarceration has been a major challenge for me. Sometimes I ask friends to help me -- to save me from myself.

what a great response!
but if one is inside the house, does it make one one's own prisoner?

 At college, we (students) often theorized and performed experiments with losing and regaining virginity --

"virgin" = moral$B!^(Bfear$B!^(Bselfishnext
"disvirgin" = courage$B!^(Bsecret$B!^(Bloss-of-eden

I listened to girls tell how they deceived their boy-friends with the alum theory! Alum saved many relationships....

Let's consider Sappho:

Parthenia, parthenia,
poi me lipois' apoikhe?

Translated by Guy Davenport as:

Girlhood O girlhood
Lost of a sudden,
Where have you gone?

Mary Barnard translates "Parthenia" as "Maidenhead."  This is probably a fragment of an epithalamium and there is a certain degree of chaffing going on here: how insubstantial, after all, is this "maidenhead"!  Tne joking tone remains in the response of the bridegroom (both voices were probably enacted by Sappho's girl pupils, though bear in mind we know very little about Sappho):

Ouketi exo
pros se
ouket'exo

Translated by Davenport as:

Nowhere, bride my darling
Nowhere near you

We're a long way from chastity belts (with thrown-away keys) and extolling of virginity!

Meritage Press is pleased to share an excerpt from one of the many
delightful poems in Housecat Kung Fu -- this is from "Lorikeet Landing":

Last Wednesday I overheard
a rainbow colored bird say
wouldn't you bring to me

a listening booth
and a swimming tree

a comfy ocean chair
and some sand from Waikiki

a wisdom tooth
and a cup of crystal tea

a mystical flying mare
and a large screen TV

or maybe a common pea
and a castle floating in air

Kenmore: Poem Unlimited

    The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
    comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
    historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
    comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
    poem unlimited

    LORD POLONIUS, The Tragedy of Hamlet,
    Prince of Denmark Act 2, Scene 2

In Geoffrey Gatza's latest collection he gives us his instructions for this
book, "The way to/the other/Is found in/the not other." While not looking
for the exact similar, he continues "fishing in the sewer gate" as he heads
backwards and into his home town. But his home town, and the investigation,
must include the poet's being brought up in Catholicism. In addition to the
Bible, he uses other (there is that word again) canonical works of the West
(the Ancient Greeks must have made quite an impression!). At times epic, at
other times lyric, Gatza continues his fusion cuisine aesthetic while he
feels "strange about it but I place / Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade /
In the DVD player and smoke a pipe." So, pop some popcorn, get some smokes,
and read about this movie cum poem.

=8BKevin Thurston

In this exhilarating investigation marking the overdetermined space of
relation between the arbitrary character of language and the singular
materiality of place, Gatza insists =B3Kenmore may hold the key to our
stability=8A.=B2 Kenmore, he tells us, is an otherwise anonymous village in
Eerie Country, NY on the outskirts of Buffalo=8Ba village that could be any
and every village but is, in the materiality of its ordinariness, singularl=
y
unique. Like Kerouac's Lowell, O'Hara's New York or Olson's Gloucester,
Gatza's Kenmore is an interminably unfolding geo-social space exhaustively
filtered through the shifting textures of a kinetic imagination always in
overdrive.

=8BRichard Owens

Synopsis:

It is the way things change that brings the myth to Kenmore, the poet's
hometown. This collection of poems is one work, divided. Blending two
stories, the story of Gwion And The Wisdom Potion taken from the Mabinogi
and the apocryphal apocalyptic text, The Book of Enoch. Through Devils,
Giants and Dream Visions; A Magic Silver Fish of Wisdom, a witch and maple
keys, the poet passes through life to a rebirth in the womb of a witch to a
new life to a death that begins to look like life only to come back to find
providence is truly suburbia.

I mentioned Simone Weil earlier, but forgot to add --



i think it was during the
late 80's when books such as "The Dancing Woo Lee Masters" and "The Tao
of Physics" came out. Suddenly, Eastern thought became very
fashionable. I'm attracted to writers of extreme, obsessive vision.
Simone certainly qualifies. Ditto Pascal. Still, it's hard not to be
embarressed admitting an attraction to a writer who happens to be
Christian as the tradition has been contaminated by so much dopey junk.
Sad. But I refuse to throw away Augustine or Flannery O' Conner because
of a few idiots.

recently a prof at ubc wrote me asking permission to use some screenshots
from my work. he's writing a book called 'a philosophy of computer art'.
now, that's interesting to me. how would i write such a thing myself?

well, i'm not sure, but what i want to say in this e to you, mike, is that i
would regard it as important in such a book to involve the theory of
computation in some ways. could we say that the big picture of the theory of
computation is about what can be done with/by computers and what can't?

it's richly ironic that the turing machine fell out of turing's main work of
solving the Entscheidungsproblem. he was out to solve a math problem,
mainly, not invent the computer. and the turing machine was invented to show
that there are some tasks no machine can complete. not to do amazing things
with the machine, but to show that there are some things no machine can do.
the greatest machine ever invented was invented to show that there are some
things no machine can ever do. that's poetic.

but we also see that it was invented to plumb the reaches of what is
possible with machines.

what would this have to do with a philosophy of computer art? well, i would
think that a philosophy of computer art should have a firm grasp on the
theoretical nature and limits of computers. the poetics of computer art
should include the theory of computation as one of the erm 'touchstones'.

but it and art are generally worlds apart.

there's so much fear about our relation to machines. similar to the reaction
to darwin's ideas, in his day. just as people felt that it diminishes
humanity to think all living things on earth descend from common forms,
people feel that it diminishes humanity to think that there probably are no
thought processes of which humans are capable and computers are not.

but just as we now see Darwinism in a different light--we don't feel
diminished by it, but are opening our eyes to the wonders it helps
reveal--about ourselves, our history, and all living things on the planet,
and our shared history--so too, i imagine, over time, will we start to
open our eyes to the mysteries and solutions that are raised in the idea
that we are basically machines--amazing machines, but machines
nonetheless.

poetry is partly about who and what we are. poetry that can deal suitably
with the notion that we are machines is needed, just as art and other
expressions that reveal the visions of darwinism was and still is needed. so
that we might be both rational and fully human, see the beauty in what truly
is.

these are good, great, i don't havemuch to say about them, they'll have to
carry their own weight, that's difficult perhaps for you to receive them
in this mannewr, used, as you might be, to receivethem with explanation,
description,at least theory, that's here somewhere, but there are so many
now, it would be impossible, at least with this group, to do more than
present them, hope you view at least a )few) - then draw your own
conclusions, the reign of production is constant here, i'm just preparing
these as a 'new batch' - you understand, at least with this batch, the
primacy of the visual, notalways though, sometimes hardly at all - the
theoretical takes over - but these have so many small or large themes,
mpomments, concepts, what have you - so they might stand on their own, but
replete, fecund, too much, too many, sdefuge sets in and then there's just
one more image, the fnal image you'll see before you'r exhausted, and it's
)that_ image that entrances you that you'll remember.. -

Ryerson University=92s CKLN, 88.1 FM
Tuesday, January 20, 2:00 =96 3:00 pm
Online listening: http://www.ckln.fm

As John Stewart put it so eloquently, the US is celebrating the election of=
 its first Hawaiian president =96 and his middle name is Hussein! Holy brok=
en barriers!

To celebrate Obama=92s inauguration on Tuesday, I will feature a set of unl=
ikely sound poets =96 OK it=92s a bit of a stretch since I had planned this=
 set before I realized that my show would coincide with the inauguration. B=
ut it seemed somehow fitting. So I lift my champagne glass to the breath of=
 fresh air who is Obama while I air some unlikely candidates for the sound =
poetry rubric =96 a babbling baby, Yma Sumac (anyone remember her?), Oklaho=
ma glossolalia, diddlers, a bird imitation or two, and Marie Osmond perform=
ing Hugo Ball=92s Karawane (yep).

To continue my symbolic salute to Obama, I'll do a set alternating between =
between Canadian and American sound poets to signify renewed friendship bet=
ween the =93z=94 and the =93zed=94 tribes.

Bottoms up!

Many books=2C articles=2C writings by myself =2C have noted similarities in=
 the
actions=2C rhetoric and over all goals

which have been used against the American Indians and the Palestinians.=20
If one is familiar with even a bit of the dehumanizing=20

terms=2C names=2C lies=2C and justifications for things beyond unjust used =
regarding
one of these peoples=2C then one will readily recognize it  when turning to=
 the other.



Today/night on Democracy Now! Three guests address what it is like on the
silenced side of the Wall=2C the side of dehumanized existence.



President Clinton was known for his "friends of Bill=2C" and perhaps
President Obama has already added a new wrinkle=2C with the "former friends
of Barack."=20



Khalid Rashidi is one of these "former friends" who was left out in
the old while undergoing massive attacks fro Gov Palin=2C Sen McClain and t=
he Fox
Bellowers of Rightwing Righteousness.  In the interview with Amy Goodman
he speaks eloquently of the current events in Gaza and the role of the US
there=2C via massive (many illegal under American Law) shipments of weapons=
=2C
gigantic infusions of cash (8=2C000=2C000$ a day) and the full support of t=
he US's
politicians and media=2C despite a rising tide of protest among the America=
n
Jewish Community along with a great many other organizations.



Dr. Rashidi also points out the difficulty in the USA
of presenting information regarding Gaza and
Palestinian questions historically in the US media.  As an example he
points to the day's NY Times article on the bombing of UN headquarters in G=
aza=2C
which was packed with al the recently arrived deliveries of food and fuel f=
or
people who have been steadily starving over the course of the last two year=
s=2C
until almost complete starvation levels are being reached in the last
months.  Dr Rashidi points out the Times article takes up ten paragraphs
given the justifications for this bombing=2C with the newspaper basically w=
orking as a conduit
through which the IDF funnels its versions of events=2C despite their compl=
ete
contradiction to the reports from International aid workers at the scene.

          =20



In a sense this media control creates another Wall behind which the
Palestinians are hidden and cut of from the world=2C while Americans receiv=
e only
a propagandistic and dehumanized view of Palestinians and their slaughter. =
If one goes through the history of reporting on American Indians=2C even to=
 this day=2C the dehumanization is strongly present. The consequences of th=
e dehumanization of persons are only all too well known=2C all over the wor=
ld.



Dr Suleiman Baraka is interviewed also=2C a Palestinian Astrophysicist at
Virginia Tech who tells of learning over the phone his mother and son have =
been
critically injured when a one ton bomb was dropped on their house. This is
one of the most moving interviews I have ever seen on War=2C all wars=2C an=
d its
effects on an entire extended family as it steadily loses its members.





With the pardon of Marc Rich back in the news due to the questioning of the
nominee for Attorney general  Mr. Eric Holder=2C Amy Goodwin interviews the
writer Louise Erdrich for a perspective from one American Indian=92s view (=
though
is shared by all) of Clinton's pardoning a mega scumbag and fugitive from
justice like Rich=2C while denying any clemency to Leonard Peltier=2C impri=
soned
now 35 years due to a rigged trial=2C for shooting FBI agents during an enc=
ounter
with the AIM (American Indian Movement--for a number of years classified as=
 a
"terrorist" organization by the US Govt.)



Also two reports on a Palestinian Doctor who papers frequently on Israeli T=
V=2C

Tel Aviv - A Palestinian doctor from Gaza who was a regular  guest on Israe=

Friday called a reporter who had interviewed him many times=2C screaming
frantically that his house had just been bombed by the military.=20
=20
'My girls=2C oh god=2C they've killed my girls=2C' cried Ezz al-Din Abu
al-Aish=2C the doctor=2C as the Israeli reporter held his mobile phone to
the microphone during a live broadcast. =20
  Abu al-Aish's home in Beit Lahiya=2C in the northern Gaza Strip=2C had  j=
ust been hit by a shell=2C fired by Israeli soldiers. =20
=20
The doctor works as a gynecologist at both hospitals in Gaza as well as
the Tel Hashomer medical center in Israel and speaks fluent Hebrew=2C
making him an ideal guest for the television.=20
  'I hope anyone
who can hear us=2C the military=2C the red cross=2C can get there=2C' the
emotional reporter=2C Shlomi Eldar said=2C announcing the exact location of
the doctor's home=2C hoping help would arrive quickly.=20
  Eldar then went off-camera to call his numerous contacts in Israel  and t=
ry and get the family assistance. =20
  Medical teams have reported extreme limitations on their movement  during=
 the ongoing Israeli military campaign. =20
=20
Three girls of the doctor's eight children died in the attack=2C two
others were injured as was he=2C and they were taken to hospitals in
Israel.=20
  The doctor had become a mainstay on Channel 10=2C
giving daily updates to Eldar and other reporters on the unfolding
Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip=2C and adding his own moderate
political message.

it does seem threatening to humanity to think that the human mind is
strictly mechanical loosely, but i would caution anyone who thinks
that the limitations on computability apply human minds to read
hubert dreyfus's "what computers still can't do" very carefully as it
is quite good on precisely the ways in which some human activities
are differentiated from things that computers are capable of.

The argument about communism used to be that you couldn't blame it
for the 100s of millions of deaths at the hands of Stalin or Mao,
that wasn't really communism, which hasn't been tried yet. Some of
the dopey junk of christianity includes inquisitions, religious wars,
genocide. Maybe that wasn't really christianity. Of course,
christianity begins with the claim that there's a sky god who to test
our fidelity asks us to believe that he got a virgin pregnant and she
had a kid who was also god.

On this was erected a great many beautiful, seductive things, and
some extraordinarily complex thought in the enterprise of trying to
rationalize that origin story. Is that what you mean dopey?

Me, I'm Jewish. Doesn't do much for me.

I know some of Weil's family, by the way. She seems to have embraced
christianity and anorexia at the same time. They were secular Jews
and didn't get it.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Any help with the below would be appreciated.

I was asked to be a guest blogger for the duration of this week at the BAP
blog ("Best American Poetry").
Since the Scribner BAP series began in 1988, the formulation "best american
poetry" has not-so-intentionally underscored the politics of aesthetic
assessment, anthology making, nationalism in letters, and the cult of the
virtuoso. Clearly BAP as a formulation can (and often has) been easily read
as code that tacitly asks for a collective misrecognition of oral, visual,
and concrete poetics, diaspora poetics, oppositional poetics, much
ethnopoetics, race and racialized poetics, dysraphic poetics, and the
sociology of assessment and symbolic economies in general.

I want to post a series of individual, signed,
sentences/aphorisms/paragraphs by people from this list concerning the
formulation "best american poetry" andor poetry/poetics in general. If you
want to include text from others, please give a brief citation. No word
limit.

The sooner the better (will post as I acquire them) -- but all please by
Wednesday.

If you could email those to me (gabrielgudding@gmail.com) or post them here
frontchannel, I'd appreciate it. I'll post them all to the blog. The only
proviso for their blog: no personal attacks.

If you need a cue beyond the above, I'd ask you to reply to this
formulation: "Best American Poetry: ?"

Thanks.

Gabe

I don't know what Elizabeth Alexander will come up with for Tuesday, but this
may be a good time for another look at this poem by Lorenzo Thomas. Â As
always, Lorenzo was prescient. Â Here he foresees both "irrational exuberance"
and that god-awful song, nearly resuced by Joan Osborne, "What if God was one
of us?"

Inauguration

Present



Friday, *February 13th*, 2009 7-9PM

*KGB Bar*, 85 East 4th Street, N.Y.C.



*Joshua Cohen* is the author of four books, including the novels *Cadenza
for the Schneidermann Violin Concerto *(Fugue State Press, 2007) and *A
Heaven of Others *(Starcherone, 2007). Another novel, *Graven Imaginings*,
is forthcoming from Dalkey Archive Press. Essays have appeared in The
Forward, Nextbook, The Believer, and Harper's. North Vain, Bluff, from which
the piece that appears in the current issue of Harp & Altar is excerpted, is
the second book of a series entitled *Two Great Russian Novels*. He lives in
Brooklyn.

*Tim Horvath*, whose fiction appears in the current issue of MHR, won the
2006 Raymond Carver Short Story Award and the '06 prize of the Society for
the Study of the Short Story. His stories are out or forthcoming in
Alimentum: The Literature of Food, Fiction, Web Conjunctions, SleepingFish,
Sein und Werden, and elsewhere. He teaches a class for Grub Street Writers
in Boston centered on the application of findings from brain science to
writing and literature. His novella *Circulation*, called "a glittering
narrative performance" by David Huddle, will be released as a short book by
Sunnyoutside Press in March 2009. He is currently working on a novel in
which one or more (it is unclear which) microscopic counter-novels fester in
the interstices of the typeface and must be eradicated lest the
infra-structure come crashing down.

*Joanna Howard *is the author of Frights of Fancy, a collection of short
prose forthcoming from Boa Editions. Her work has appeared in Conjunctions,
Chicago Review, Unsaid, Quarterly West, American Letters and Commentary,
Fourteen Hills, Western Humanities Review, Salt Hill, Tarpaulin Sky and
elsewhere. A chapbook In the Colorless Round, with artwork by novelist and
artist Rikki Ducornet, is available from Noemi Press. Her "Seascape"
appeared in Harp & Altar #2.

*Mary Mackey*, with poems forthcoming in MHR Issue 11, is a poet and
novelist who lives in Berkeley, California.  She is the author of five
collections of poetry, including *Breaking The Fever *(Marsh Hawk Press);
one experimental novella, *Immersion*; and fourteen novels, including *A
Grand Passion *(Simon & Schuster), *The Year the Horses Came *(HarperCollins),
*The Notorious Mrs. Winston* (Putnam/Berkley Books), and *The Widow's
War *(Putnam/Berkley
Books--in press for Fall 2009).  Mackey's works have been translated into
eleven foreign languages including Japanese, Hebrew, Greek, and Finnish. She
has lectured at Harvard and the Smithsonian, is past president of the West
Coast branch of PEN, a Fellow of the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts,
and Professor Emeritus of English at California State University. A member
of the Writers Guild of America, West, she wrote the screenplay for the
award-winning feature film Silence. More information about her can be found
at www.marymackey.com. and at www.marshhawkpress.org.

Hi Mark,

Shame about your twisted cynical remarks on christianity, as you must
imagine, there are  people of all persuasions out here and if we all started
slagging off each others particular ideologies it would make for a rather
sad website so let's get a bit more positive, creative and constructive,
rather than destructive, surely thinking around poetry should include a good
measure of creativity and excursons into the imagination - there doesn't
seem to be much of either going on at the moment!

Roy Exley.

> it does seem threatening to humanity to think that the human mind is
> strictly mechanical loosely,

i'm not sure what you mean by "strictly mechanical loosely", jason.

i expect we might agree that whatever the mind is, it's to be distinguished
from the brain. and i expect that we might also agree that the brain itself
operates bio-mechanically. in other words, the brain is a machine, though it
be organic, biological.

but just because the brain is a machine, though organic and biological, does
not mean that the mind is limited to the same level of complexity as the
mechanisms of the brain.

similarly, very similarly, software can be more complex in its architectural
complexity than the machine it operates on, though the machine supports the
operation of the software.

similarly, what we write can be of a higher order of complexity than the
alphabet or the rules of grammar.

whatever else the mind may be, surely it is 'emergent' in the following
sense, which i am using analogically, not literally. emergent behavior in
software is behavior that the programmer has not explicitly programmed, but
the emergent behavior emerges from what has been explicitly programmed. for
instance, if software is written that allows it to re-write itself to meet
various challenges, then we can see how the possibility exists of it
eventually 'growing' and 'evolving' into a thing with behaviors that the
programmer could never have anticipated.

in a sense, living things are the ultimate in the process of software
evolution. there's evolution that happens on the physical level, and then
there's evolution that happens on the level of mind or cognitive complexity
in architectural, informational structure and process. and of course they're
related--the mental is supported by the physical--but the complexity of the
data structures and the architecture of the data processing is not simply
physical in the same way that you usually can't understand a poem simply by
looking at it. it has to be read and a whole imaginary world constructed via
the reading that is in some sort of correspondence with physical worlds
themselves but is in no way identical with those physical worlds.

if there was a widely recognized argument that there are thought processes
of which humans are capable but computers are not, it would be front-page
news.

not today--for this is the very beautiful day, so long coming and admired
around the globe--of the inauguration of Barack Obama--but the day after.

can you tell me what writings of hubert dreyfus you're thinking of? i don't
know his writing.

Subject:      Alexander's  poem/ Lowery's Benediction
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Spiritual Life: Poetry and prayer: Parallels of invocationMuch the way that=
, say, Lorenzo Thomas' work was, I must say Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery's Ben=
ediction was more poetry than Alexander delivered, proving in full that POE=
TRY SPEAKS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE akin to prayer. The benediction, like authe=
ntic poetry, was an activity. It activated.=20

I am less concerned here, at the start, about what one prays -the creed of =
prayer-than that one begins an inner life of words, praying, or poetry, and=
 that one finds a certain attitude of inner life. This can be found by at t=
he very start of Lowery's work, of his saying focal words, using even secul=
ar prayers, including a poetics, even for those of us who have not found Go=
d, grace, a religion, or a church.=20

If his benediction was not petry, it is like poetry, like swimming--one has=
, sometime, to jump into the words or water and hope that something will be=
 there. That something will hold one up. One has to learn the strokes, mayb=
e, on dry land beforehand.=20

His prayer itself opened the dimension of the other, of the higher or the d=
ivine. Like an authentic poem, one prayer, is like one grain of sand on the=
 beach-it starts the dialogue.=20

Alexander's poem, without its focus words, was poetry that cannot help a pe=
rson in the direction that leads to prayer: that of wholeness, or healing, =
which is the secret realm of holiness.=20

Lowery's poem/prayer begins with the cultivation of an attitude, not just i=
n stillness or some strange church, and this is where his poetry can help p=
rayer: What is the magic word? You need not be a church person, an Muslim, =
a Jew, or a Christian to say this poem, or even a believer, but it can invo=
ke the same attitude of reverence or relaxation response -that prayer awake=
s in a person.=20

Lowery evoked a poetry activating the memory, attitude, and perception, and=
 it may be a good beginning or refresher for persons interested in elicitin=
g the peace, power, and the active inner life of prayer. After all, prayer =
and poetry originally come from the same place, and much early poetry was s=
acred. Poetry, like prayer, accompanied ceremonies both at the temple and a=
t the court. They were observances of the priest and king. They had the fun=
ction of ritualizing, raising, and celebrating a sense of higher life. They=
 were a training and discipline of inner attitude towards public and divine=
 and even supernatural events. They were the developers of the culture.=20

Alexander failed to recapture some of these beginnings of us and the world =
through both poetry and prayer.=20

Poetry, from the Greek word poesis (to make), like prayer from the Sanskrit=
 word pras or prcchati (for asking), often calls on unseen powers and addre=
sses nature, the lover, time, or the West Wind as Thou. This is the mood of=
 invocation. It is, philosophically and grammatically, the vocative relatio=
n: the poet calls out "0 Thou" to the universe. It is the grammatical case,=
 the vocative, in inflected languages which calls out or invokes. This voca=
tive relation-the grammar of calling out-is a personalizing, a connectednes=
s with destiny, death, love and chance, shared by prayer and poetry alike. =
The vocative relation, or mood of invocation, is the calling out of the sou=
l to life itself, be it the West Wind, Joy, the fountains and meadows, or l=
ove, or time, or even death.=20

Alexander's poem, though well-constructed, accomplished none of this.

Lowery, in his inner life, impersonated the world, and all poetry is a kind=
 of prayer to the universe.=20

Lowery's prayer, can be memorized poems and repeated, revealing an inner la=
ndscape that can offset the evil, trouble, and turmoil of everyday life, th=
e kind dished up for us by the past eight years of the previous failure of =
an administration.=20

Lowery's Benediction set the mood of invocation, waking up the inner depend=
ence we have on beauty, truth, and goodness, and will go farther than Alexa=
nder's poem to help us actually create it. It put us between a prayer and a=
 meditation. The attitude of the soul, the poem, enlivens the moment. This =
is the kind of waking up of the inner life that the vocative relation, whet=
her addressed to God or no, can bring.=20

The Benediction more than the poem invoked meaning, which is indeed, the in=
terface between prayer and meditation. In meaning we make an effort not jus=
t with the heart but also with the mind to awaken the sense of words so tha=
t as we repeat the formula or poem, we are discovering thought afresh.=20

Lowery's poem/prayer works, too, because he realizes the outward world chan=
ges. Days change. But the word Grace, constantly repeated, can measure all =
vicissitudes. It is the same with poems that we have internalized, making l=
ife ours in an inward song that no outer circumstances can change. This is =
that inward landscape of the relaxation response that can be such a great r=
elief against stress, effecting even musculoskeletal, fight-or-flight, and =
psycho-immunological symptoms. Here Lowery addressed his love. The attitude=
 of the poem is a prayer.=20

Alexander's poem failed to activate the inward life. It had no sense of wha=
t it means to build soul out of words, memory, repetition, and attitude. Ab=
sent was a kind of undertone, as if the mind were whispering to itself, to =
love, to destiny, to the universe. There was no inward speech, whether pray=
er or poem, between language and thought.=20

The Benediction poem was part prayer, part meditation. We can pray it, but =
we can also meditate it.=20

Right now, we need this kind of meditation to help us crawl our of our nigh=
tmare.

It is, on the whole, possible to meditate poetry and, as Re. Dr. Lowery did=
, to poeticize a meditation into a prayer.

What did you all think of Alexander's poem?  Does anyone else write "their"
Inaugural Poem?   Here's mine written right after the event, which I watched
here in France.  --   Laura Hinton

Millions Witness a Profound Moment in Nation's
History<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/us/politics/20web-inaug2.html?hp>--
New York Times headline just after Obama's inauguaration

I'm sitting on a real-marble floor in this small southern French town -- the
food shops closed early or at half-mask
as if a death but in honor of beer glasses full and CNN streaming live
in bars open wide to neighborhood provencials

       all of whom voted for Sarkozy
                     (before he married Carla Bruni)
so they can watch with pride
*their own*
first U.S. president who is black sworn in, president
of my country hated here not just "since Reagan" (New York Times writes
today)
but since I was a child and it was "Vietnam," and the people in the cafe
don't understand why
at 4 p.m. on the beach I should leave the sunshine, the ball game, the
kissing dogs, my Coke Light
half empty
to hurry home so quickly
drive back through winding roads up altitudes filtered by January veils
of water-mist mixed
with smoke from burning underbrush -- ash to ash, they always burn
                    the old wood here, the dead wood
these  bright winter days --  while
*baous* form little arks of illuminations
golden light top to top
and nothing else save the landscape's
evening greyness

but not to miss Rick Warren say his mea culpa before his God
Aretha Franklin singing Say Can You See in her basso profundo hat
Rev. Lowery rhyming "yellow can be mellow" and everyone
watching Little Bush and Daddy Bush get on their helicopter
wave bye bye

and the whole world wondering  -- if it ever can be right
when a helicopter's half-hand
is seen out a window

four people, half white, half black, like
souls
standing there, on the nation's backstairs
freezing, waving
bye-bye back

PETITION TO REINSTATE ARTS COUNCIL
FUNDING TO WESTERN WRITERS' CENTRE

The Arts Council of the Republic of Ireland have removed all funding
from the Western Writers' Centre, Ionad Scr=EDbhneoir=ED Chaitl=EDn Maude.

http://www.twwc.ie/

The Centre has been in operation as the only Writers' Centre west of
the Shannon for almost seven years and has provided workshops,
readings, a website, and a newsletter, "The Word Tree."

They were the first to organise a writers' residence to a Galway
hospital.  They also run an annual festival, "The Forge at Gort."

Their commitment to the Irish language and Irish language writers has
also been a foremost feature of their working policy.

The Arts Council grant of =8010,000 enabled them to plan forward, to
develop this Centre.

http://www.twwc.ie/

Please take the time to add your name to the petition calling for
REINSTATEMENT of Arts Council Funding!  You will find the petition at

Thank you for making this personal.

I doubt very much that I've endangered any of the various churches,
twisted cynic that I am. Should I also be positive, creative and
constructive about other political ideologies, or are you just
talking about religions? If so, what's beyond the pale? Let's hear it
for mesoamerican human sacrifice.

Years ago I dated a woman who had escaped (her term) from the
fundamentalist church in which she was raised. Her parents, who to
all appearances loved her, told her repeatedly that they feared she
would go to hell. My fate went without saying. One morning, in an
excess of happiness, I was whistling Amazing Grace. "How can you
whistle that terrible song?" she snarled. "Haven't you listened to
the words? It says I'm a wretch." That's when I learned that you
don't have to imagine a cross burning on the lawn to have been
damaged by the faith.

What do you mean by creativity?

Mark

with "strictly mechanical loosely," i am badly wording the idea that
you went into greater depth on that the mind is mechanical as a
consequence of the brain mechanims. I was quite tired, but i'm pretty
sure that's waht i meant, although looking at it now, that's just a
guess.

I get the analogy that yr making Jim, I just think it's flawed in
that I don't think it's at all settled that the thinking mechanism of
the brain works through the manipulation of explicit symbols, which
is what software does. I think the brain/mind hardware/software
analogy is a very tempting one, and it may in fact turn out to be
good, but I don't like it because it leads down a path that I don't
want to go down. I have a friend who is a doctor and neuroscientist
and while she was in grad school and we talked about these issues, I
watched her become even more of a hardcore scientific materialist as
she has learned more about brain function, to the point that she's
become a hard determinist and it's my understanding that most
neuroscientists are in the same camp at this point. i can't accept
that and as a result have tried to think very hard about where this
all breaks down for me, and the idea of the mind as emergent from
mechanical processes analogous to binary logic gates is where that
breaking point is.

Dreyfus is one of the more vocal philosopher's who along with Searle
and a few others have been highly critical of the computer science
program generally called "strong AI" in the phil. of mind/comp sci/
cog sci literature. The book you should read is "What Computer's
Still Can't Do." There's an abstract of the argument in it on the
wikipedia entry for dreyfus, although I don't think it does it
justice really. But that's most likely because Dreyfus is a Heidegger
scholar AND an analytic philosopher, which means there's a lot of
subtlety to his thinking that's easy to gloss over and misunderstand.

As for process that I am capable of but that I don't think computers
are capable of, here's a short list:

reflecting on why i eat more greasy spoon chinese food than is
probably healthy
deciding that i don't like the way a pair of shoes looks on me and
not wearing them anymore
feeling moved by the poetry of ted berrigan
knowing that I should do the dishes but choosing to play video games
instead
writing a line of poetry and deciding that it's garbage for some
reason x and erasing it
deciding to bluff in a game of poker because I think I've intuitively
figured out a tell of one of the other players even though I don't
know what that tell is
catching my own reflection in a mirror and recognizing it as my self
being reflected
being concerned for the wellbeing of a friend
feeling nervous about whether I'll be accepted by something I've
applied for and so purposefully thinking about something unrelated as
a distraction
constructing arguments to support my intuition that computers aren't
capable of the same sorts of thoughts as I am

what all of this boils down to is to make the point that dreyfus
makes much better than I'm capable of paraphrasing, part of human
consciousness is the human encounter with the world as the being that
recognizes its own being in the world. everything else arises from
that, and that itself is not a thought so much as it is an
experience. i don't know how you can make a computer experience it's
own thisness through programming. i'm not even sure what that sort of
program might look like, but it's not the kind of thing that i can
see a way to implementing on any given turing machine of sufficient
power, since it has more to do than just deal with discrete symbols
signifying discrete facts.

Going to hell in a handbasket is probably more instructive than getting to =
heaven in an elevator.  Positive=2C creative and constructive qualities are=
 all in league with the devil.  Small "d".  Or at least Milton thought so. =

with an innovative twist and the kind of attention to language that
pushes beyond craft into art; it produces books whose design takes
these high standards as well. The Sawtooth Poetry Prize, established
in 2001, has gone to Aaron McCollough, Graham Foust, Noah Eli Gordon,
Karla Kelsey, and Paige Ackerson-Kiely; Rusty Morrison, who received
the sixth Sawtooth award, was recently also awarded the James Laughlin
Prize from the Academy of American Poets; recent winner Barbara
Maloutas is author of the Whole Marie, published this month. Rae
Armantrout will judge the awards in 2009. The name "Ahsahta" comes
from the Mandan word for a Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, and was first
recorded by the Lewis and Clark expedition in Idaho.

i think that's an interesting point, jason. let's explore it.

if we look in a computer, we won't find any zeros and ones. merely
transistors that are charged (1) or not charged (0). also, if we compare the
source code (which won't run) written by a human in, say, C++ with the
compiled machine language version of the source code (which will run), we
would see there is no one-to-one correspondence between the symbols in the
source code and the binary symbols in the machine language version. the
source code gets converted to machine language in the process of
'compilation', creating a file that will run, and this process converts the
humanly authored file into a strange binary beast that can be fed to a
central processor, which is really quite limited in its operations. this is
code level stuff. but, still, the symbols are explicit.

computers have to be intelligable, nonetheless, to humans. there's weird
code zipping around, but all in explicit symbols that have to be humanly
intelligable. of course, the inner workings of the brain do not have to be
humanly intelligable. or intelligable to any sentient being. but they do
have to help the critter survive. there has to be some consistency and
integrity to the way the brain deals with sense data. so it's hard to see
how the brain might not code the egg foo yong in some sort of set of symbols
that remain stable over time.

of course, we know that the body does indeed deal with codes of some kinds.
dna, for instance. the ribozome reads the dna sequence in a c t g code much
like a computer reads an input string. the ribozome is like a computer that
we would very much like to understand the program for. the a c t g code does
appear to be a set of explicit symbols. now, this doesn't mean that the
brain operates this way also, but we understand that for information to be
stored and processed in a consistent manner, explicit symbols are very
useful.

do you have any ideas of how one might avoid explicit symbols?

by the way, i make the best chow mein on the planet.

Mark asked me what I meant by dopey junk.

I meant, for the most part, the used car salesmen disguised as ministers that flood the airwaves every week. The feel good mega churches that do little more than contribute to urban sprawl while offering their fast food brand of hope.

Too much audacity.
Little thought.

Of course, the sort of fundamental Church that Mark is referring to is something far more creepy.

& he's right about the sky God, the Virgin birth, et cetera.
We can differentiate between mature Christianity -- Simone Weil, Pascal, Paul Tillich -- and silly, consumer salesmanship.

Thank you for making this personal.

I doubt very much that I've endangered any of the various churches,
twisted cynic that I am. Should I also be positive, creative and
constructive about other political ideologies, or are you just
talking about religions? If so, what's beyond the pale? Let's hear it
for mesoamerican human sacrifice.

Years ago I dated a woman who had escaped (her term) from the
fundamentalist church in which she was raised. Her parents, who to
all appearances loved her, told her repeatedly that they feared she
would go to hell. My fate went without saying. One morning, in an
excess of happiness, I was whistling Amazing Grace. "How can you
whistle that terrible song?" she snarled. "Haven't you listened
to
the words? It says I'm a wretch." That's when I learned that you
don't have to imagine a cross burning on the lawn to have been
damaged by the faith.

What do you mean by creativity?

Mark

begin with Weil.

she honed in to the core truth ( if that's the correct word?) of Christianity.
the cross, suffering.

still, i won't deny the pathology of that ethos.
torture.
it's grotesque.

& i've avoided mentioning the historical slander that Jewish people have had to deal with because of it.
the crucifix is a Roman invention.

i was raised Catholic.
if i remember correctly, i was raised in a church called Roman Catholic.
i don't recall a vacant cross (Protestant),
i do, however, remember the crucified Christ.

Catholicism doesn't sanitize its origins.
but it hasn't been fully honest either.
i seem to recall something called original sin.
hmmm...

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication of:

Sight Map: Poems

Brian Teare is the author of the award-winning The Room Where I Was
Born, as well as the forthcoming volume Pleasure and two chapbooks.
He has received Stegner, National Endowment for the Arts, and
MacDowell Colony poetry fellowships.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Teare

In Sight Map Brian Teare blends the speculative poetics of the San
Francisco Renaissance with a postconfessional candor to embody the
"open field" tradition of such poets as Robin Blaser and Robert
Duncan. Teare provides us with poems that insist on the simultaneous
physical embodiment of tactile pleasure-that which is found in the
textures of thought and language-as well as the action of syntax.
Partly informed by an ecological imagination that leads him back to
Emerson and Thoreau, Teare's method and fragmented style are
nevertheless up to the moment. Remarkable in its range, _Sight Map
_serves at once as a cross-country travelogue, a pilgrim's gnostic
progress, an improvised field guide, and a postmodern "pillowbook,"
recording the erotic conflation of lover and beloved, deity and
doubter.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Teare

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication of:

Virgil and the Mountain Cat: Poems

David Lau teaches writing at the University of California, Santa
Cruz, and Cabrillo College. His poems have appeared in Boston Review,
New Orleans Review, Wildlife, and other magazines.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Lau

At once uncompromising and highly inventive, David Lau's poems are
imbued with a musicality that lightens the dark undertones of
spoliation and entropy. Many of the poems embody a nexus of
interaction with historical events, films, modernist poetic texts,
and works of art-but from this allusion and evocation, a multifarious
voice emerges. In these pages, the electric linguistic experiment
meets a new urban, postnatural poetics, one in which poetry is not
just a play of signs and seemings but also a prismatic investigation
of our contemporary order: "Hurry up before our factory leaves. / The
first column of the Freedom Tower / traduces its ensorcellment in the
facade." Here is a poetry both deeply lyrical and resistant, a poetry
relentless in its invention and its stance against the apathy of
convention and consumption.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Lau

Subject:      NEW BOOK: Transcendental Studies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication of:

Transcendental Studies: A Trilogy

Keith Waldrop, Brooke Russell Astor Professor of Humanities at Brown
University, has published more than a dozen works each of original
poetry and translations. His first book, A Windmill Near Calvary, was
shortlisted for the 1968 National Book Award. Recent books include
The Real Subject: Queries and Conjectures of Jacob Delafon, with
Sample Poems, The House Seen from Nowhere, and a translation of The
Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Waldrop

This compelling selection of recent work by internationally
celebrated poet Keith Waldrop presents three related poem
sequences-"Shipwreck in Haven," "Falling in Love through a
Description," and "The Plummet of Vitruvius"-in a virtuosic poetic
triptych. In these quasi-abstract, experimental lines, collaged words
torn from their contexts take on new meanings. Waldrop, a longtime
admirer of such artists as the French poet Raymond Queneau and the
American painter Robert Motherwell, imposes a tonal override on
purloined materials, yet the originals continue to show through.
These powerful poems, at once metaphysical and personal, reconcile
Waldrop's romantic tendencies with formal experimentation, uniting
poetry and philosophy and revealing him as a transcendentalist for
the new millennium.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Waldrop

Here's what I posted on my blog on 1/21. If the link below to the N+1
article doesn't work, find it at http://carolnovack.blogspot.com.
 Inaugural Verse | n 1 <http://www.nplusonemag.com/inaugural-verse> The
award-winning Elizabeth Alexander was a safe choice. Her poem was and had to
be (ahem) accessible to the "masses." It was also totally unsurprising,
shallow, cliche-ridden and uninspiring, exhibiting a dearth of delight in,
and dexterity with the English language. At least she didn't mention God or
our Lord, I think (I wasn't riveted to my sofa). I mean, practically
everyone else did during and aft. Ho hum. Ho ho hum. Hum drum. Such a
God-fearing country.

Well, so here's someone else's discussion of Ms. Alexander's "poetry."

It's just two different things & not all poems are prayers to existing (or
non-existing) deities
-- one's not better than the other & there's no reason to compare.

Since this is more (and oft times less) a language (langpo) list,  and since
her poem seemed to be as much concerned with language as it was with the
interpersonal encounter and exchange, her DosPassos-like scope was very
offset by attempts to pick and choose and weave so many plyable details.

If Alexander had followed through with her plan to use the praise song form,
utilizing its
full potential (all the tools in the box) of Rhythm, incantation and
call-and-response-- which
indeed her poem's title promised, it might have risen in potential.

Now, while I won't go as far s Steven D. to say her poem sucked, (no pun,
but not much more than quickie of a blow-off in the back alley by the
dumpster) I will stay to the closer reading, which finds much of her diction
shop-worn ("gliitering edifices"").

I'm glad Obama had a poet at his ceremony (unlike Bush) & wish he had upheld
the
Constitution & banned the clerics (unlike Bush).

Interesting, perhaps even telling point you made here: How much lee-way was
Alexander given with her charge? How much was she urged to bring it into
alignment with Obama's speech? I'll bet there's a story there, since the
work was abundnt with echoes of both tone and imagery. The movement of
"walking" she used seemed spot on with Obama's regular use of the words
"path", "the road", "the journey". Seems as though she chose the path of
oratory, rather than the demanding road of poetry, making nothing new, never
once discarding the off-the-shelf metaphor, or pushing it chimera-like to a
new place.

List poems, and this was a list poem, are difficult to end in a satisfying
way. Whitman did it. Andy Clausen did it. Ponge got it did in many of his
prose poems. And while Alexander seemed to give it her best, what she seved
up was stale. The ending fell into as much clutter as a two-year old's
Jenga-looking playroom. We were waiting for a last line, a last phrase that
had already left the building.

Yes, the occasional poem, like this one with its global audience, should
still give us something new (as Marilyn Nelson did this week with her's),
something unexpected, speaking its truth to power. If not for that, why
bother?  There are many better works in her body of work. I wish she had
given the poeple some.

Good to see you on the list, Dan.

Hei folks --

<<apologies for x-posting ;-)

for those of you who are not going to be in Berlin next week for transmediale.09, there is a robust streaming and IRC presence that I would cordially invite you to check out ::

Peering beyond the alarmist scenarios in the often contradictory global warming debate, transmediale.09 examines the artistic, cultural and societal consequences that the imminent collapse of the polar ice barrier may trigger. How will climate change induce global culture change?

As part of its online programme, Berlin's festival for art and digital culture *transmediale.09 DEEP NORTH* will offer a selected package of live video streams from the House of World Cultures in Berlin from 28 January to 1 February 2009. Our streaming programme is now online. For details of where and what we will stream please visit
http://www.transmediale.de/en/transmediale09-streams-help-page-en

Dedicated transmediale IRC channels provide platforms for extended discussion leading up to and during the actual event, giving the remote community a powerful voice and a chance to engage with the sessions in Berlin. For details how to get involved (we're online now!) please visit http://www.transmediale.de/en/transmediale09-irc

Free feel to pass on this information to anyone you think might be interested in interacting with the festival, but cannot make it to Berlin - it is the next best thing to being there!

Cheers,
John

The Constitution in no way "bans the clerics" from speaking at an inauguration. The 1st Amendment prohibits the government from setting up a state religion that all must be a part of and prohibits the government from prohibiting "the free exercise" of any religion you choose to follow. It sounds to me that you are trying to get Obama to violate his own civil rights in trying to make him prohibit himself from freely exercising his own religion.

On a side note, I wish he would uphold the Constitution, but I suspect that, like Bush, he will not. If he actually upheld the Constitution 99% of the federal government would have to be abolished.

Debris Field is composed of all the objects I have worked with for the
past eight months in Odyssey; it's an archaeology of one site by another -
an archaeology that constructs something new out of the ruins.

It's not ruins: It's compressed history. It's a history of compression, of
textures, of objects, of mistakes, of failures, of errors, of misery, of
language/sex/body, of avatar sheave-skin. It what happens when an
insomniac gets hold of a virtual world.

Performance with Sandy Baldwin at opening
Song and sound by Azure Carter

Architecture for a new year:

  - shapes matter less than the comfort that coheres within them.
  - outside assume vagaries and opposition.
  - architectures as transitional objects.
  - living within the teddy-bear.
  - in the Second Life installation: dynamic micro-architectures of
- deconstruction and enclosure.
- no entrances, no exits: one appears, disappears.
- what constitutes coming and going are virtual particles =3D people.
  - virtual to the extent that one passes through doors and walls:
one passes through flats, nodes, and textures. nothing is comfortable
when the transitional turns on you.
- Second Life =3D transitional object =3D preparation for virtual life.
- real life =3D virtual life; body =3D inscription; wryting =3D body;
  - uncanny =3D inscription; world =3D word; word =3D idiotic.
  - micro-architectures of the visible: setting up the camera image
     just so: harboring time of day, weather, height, distance from
     avatar or avatar viewpoint, location beneath the ground or water
     surface or clothing, location in collusion with sheave-skin,
      moment of capture =3D arrangement of objects in flight.
- micro-architectures within objects in flight: buildings escaped
   from occupants, homes escaped from families, dwellings escaped
   from inhabitants, bodies escaped from inscription.
- bodies escaped from inscription: debris of the body, abjection.
- abjection in micro-architecture: no place to sit, no place to lie: an
avatar never lies. no place to sleep: an avatar never sleeps; no
place to declare:  an avatar tells the truth.
- coordinates, program, language, protocol, code, alphanumerics,
binary oppositions: the truth of anything unforsaken in the saying of it.
- micro-architectures: between code and architecture.

For Arena installation in Second Life:

1. Dropping those objects which have been taken - piled, flight: every-
thing flees, there's always clear space.
2. Physical objects:  non-phantom, but dropped, held in position, but
whatever for?
3.  Something tawdry, indigestible.
4. Flight to such a degree that they soon tunnel out of site (for most
settings), head out of world - the site has to be _tended,_ constantly
refurbished. Tended =3D a tendency to _disappear._
5. To work on _inpenetrable_ sound.
6. To work on transparent non-phantom objects: another position.
7. Intensities as things meld into one another - in the form of a debris
field.
8. Debris field =3D Gaza-slaughter. (title?)
9. Particulation of objects.
10. Object rings with internal physical objects can't get out.
11. None of the above.
12. Try and reach 4098m with pile. (Got to 2327.)



How to view here and in the Odyssey show

suggestions -

1. Try turning the glow off. Go to preferences, graphics, and uncheck
basic shading, if it's on. Basic shading seems to use up more resources
than anything else with the rendering engine. You can also set things
like rendering distance; the lower the distance, the faster the loading.

2. Turn the video media button off. This on the lower right-hand corner
of the screen. If you turn it on, the texture-mapping consumes a huge
amount of resources. On the other hand, the audio for the parcel (the
audio button) runs fairly lean.

3. If you find the space too cluttered to enter, try flying in.

  4. If you find flying in too cluttered, fly higher, and drop in. There is
  a dome in the center of the space which you can enter.

5. Most objects on the ground level (and some beneath the ground, on the
seafloor) will flee from you - what looks crowded from a distance might
well clear out.

6. If it clears out, look up - you'll see all sorts of things above you.

7. Fly vertically to see the rest of the exhibition. If you can't fly as
high as you want, click control-alt-d, which opens up an advanced menu.
Open the menu and get rid of camera constraints. You can then move the
camera at a great distance from your avatar body - your viewpoint moves
  independently, and you can move at least to the top of the exhibition,
which is maybe a mile or so up, SL measurement.

  8. If you get stuck anywhere, teleport back in.

9. Try moving inside the objects; the interior textures are often
different from the exterior ones (this is almost always the case with the
spheres).

10. You can push objects vertically into the sky by moving beneath them
and flying; they flee upwards.

11. You can see the exhibition 'differently' by using the advanced menu,
going to render, and then looking for info - clicking on any one of the
info options will give you different viewpoints.

  12. You can often sit on moving objects, which will whirl you around; if
  you sit on an object that moves vertically as a result of your proximity,
you can ride it up. When you stand up again, you can fall down back into
the space. The riding height seems to be around 4098 SL units, but unless
you have a flight bracelet or feather, you probably won't go that high.
(Gaz can go anywhere.)

13. Moving about on the ground level, keep the sound turned on (lower
right), and you'll hear a variety of songs about SL and language. These
mix with a number of looping sound modules embedded in the space.

14. Go to
  http://www.kippiefriedkin.com/resources/secondlife-viewer-cheatsheet.pdf
for shortcuts for all sorts of rendering possibilities; most
of these are also available in the menu or advanced menu.

15. If you've been moving around SL a lot, go to preferences, and empty
your cache; this might speed things up. You'll have to restart SL again.

  16. If you see a sign for teleporting, try it. Sometimes it will lead
back to the ground level, sometimes to the seabed, sometimes to a
skysphere. All of these locations have clickable objects which will take
you else- where (or back to the same space but at a slightly different
location). You might have to right-click on the object, then click on
teleport - or you might just left click - it depends on the object.

17, Try different 'lenses' - click on control-8 to make the image wide-
angle, control-9 to return to normal, control-0 for telephoto. Repeated
clicks work as well - with control-8 you can create extreme distortions.

18, Try moving into 'small' spaces and look about. You can save snapshots
of anything you see, on your hard drive.

19. That's about it. The general idea is to run lean, fly about, teleport
back if you're stuck, play with the controls. The architecture is
constantly changing and deconstructing itself =C2=96 play.

The passage in our constitution that says Congress "shall make no law
respecting an etablishment of religion" means much more than simply that the
government cannot set up a state religion that all must be part of . . .Â 
But neither does it appear to prohibit the extending of invitations to clerics
to say a few words at a public ceremony --Â 
Though I note that even while making room for "non-believers" in his remarks,
Obama didn't invite any "openly atheistic" speakers to add a few words to the
occasion. Â How 'bout a secular humanist benediction, huh?
But what's with this long tradition of adding "so help me God" to the oath? --
the whole reason that the constitutionally prescribed oath, which Roberts
mucked up, allows a president to "affirm" instead of "swear" is a recognition
that some among us have objections of conscience to swearing oaths -- Take a
look at the chain of Supreme Court decisions about whether Jehovah's Wintnesses
can be compelled to recite the pledge of allegiance for one example of just how
important this is --Â

It's just two different things & not all poems are prayers to existing
(or non-existing) deities
-- one's not better than the other & there's no reason to compare.

Since this is more (and oft times less) a language (langpo) list,  and since
her poem seemed to be as much concerned with language as it was with the
interpersonal encounter and exchange, her DosPassos-like scope was very offset
by attempts to pick and choose and weave so many plyable details.

If Alexander had followed through with her plan to use the praise song form,
utilizing its
full potential (all the tools in the box) of Rhythm, incantation and
call-and-response-- which
indeed her poem's title promised, it might have risen in potential.

Now, while I won't go as far s Steven D. to say her poem sucked, (no pun,
but not much more than quickie of a blow-off in the back alley by the dumpster)
I will stay to the closer reading, which finds much of her diction shop-worn
("gliitering edifices"").

I'm glad Obama had a poet at his ceremony (unlike Bush) & wish he had
upheld the
Constitution & banned the clerics (unlike Bush).

Interesting, perhaps even telling point you made here: How much lee-way was
Alexander given with her charge? How much was she urged to bring it into
alignment with Obama's speech? I'll bet there's a story there, since
the work was abundnt with echoes of both tone and imagery. The movement of
"walking" she used seemed spot on with Obama's regular use of the
words "path", "the road", "the journey". Seems as
though she chose the path of oratory, rather than the demanding road of poetry,
making nothing new, never once discarding the off-the-shelf metaphor, or pushing
it chimera-like to a new place.

List poems, and this was a list poem, are difficult to end in a satisfying way.
Whitman did it. Andy Clausen did it. Ponge got it did in many of his prose
poems. And while Alexander seemed to give it her best, what she seved up was
stale. The ending fell into as much clutter as a two-year old's
Jenga-looking playroom. We were waiting for a last line, a last phrase that had
already left the building.

Yes, the occasional poem, like this one with its global audience, should still
give us something new (as Marilyn Nelson did this week with her's),
something unexpected, speaking its truth to power. If not for that, why bother?
There are many better works in her body of work. I wish she had given the poeple
some.

Good to see you on the list, Dan.

first U.S. president who is black sworn in, president
of my country hated here not just "since Reagan" (New York Times writes
today)
but since I was a child and it was "Vietnam," and the people in the cafe
don't understand why
at 4 p.m. on the beach I should leave the sunshine, the ball game, the
kissing dogs, my Coke Light
half empty
to hurry home so quickly
driving back through winding roads up altitudes filtered by January veils
of water-mist mixed
with smoke from burning underbrush -- ash to ash, they always burn
                    the old wood here, the dead wood
these  bright winter days --  while
*baous* form little arks of illuminations
golden light top to top
and nothing else save the landscape's
evening greyness

but there's no missing Rick Warren say his mea culpa before his God
Aretha Franklin singing Say Can You See in her basso profundo hat
Rev. Lowery rhyming "yellow can be mellow" and everyone
watching Little Bush and Daddy Bush get on their helicopter
wave bye bye

and the whole world wondering  -- if it ever can be right
when a helicopter's half-hand
is seen out a window

four people, half white, half black, like
                  souls
standing there, on the nation's backstairs
freezing, waving
bye-bye back

Obama's was best, Lowery's an awesome second. Tied for third, Alexander's
and Warren's, only because "the Saddelback" fascinated perversely for how
he kind of sucked his flesh into himself so as to verbally present a
humbled and puritanically burnished, exteriorized rhetoric (even while
condescension continued dripping onto the face of many phrases, a nervous
sweat of long e's and i's). Alexander's had CNN camera help, with frequent
cuts, during her stately blank iambics, to the blanks of mall space
emerging as crowds dispersed (something Jon Stewart joked about, at
poetry's expense).

Lowery's! Coming in from the side somewhere, as he spoke. Aspirating
syllables, so as to give necessary indirection to some of what wanted
saying, one might even say a roughness and plainness to it all. Lowery!
Was his rhyme a re-articulated patchwork of 60s song allusions (Donovan,
etc), or that target too overdetermined?

Hello, all!

On February 1st, the Nonsense Company (of which I comprise a third) will pe=
rform Great Hymn of Thanksgiving / Conversation Storm
in Philadelphia, followed by a two-week run at NYC's Interborough
Repertory Theater. We've been performing these pieces for a couple of
years, and they're in the best shape they're likely to achieve before
we retire them in the face of inevitable comments about the
obsolescence of work about war and torture in the Obama era. In any
case, here they are, with intricate group speech, dinner table
percussion, precise acting and formally odd composition.=20

Also, on January 31st, the SEGUE foundation will host a launch reading for =
the fourth issue of Cannot
 Exist, the magazine I
 started editing last
 February. Lots of great poets will be there to read their work and talk ab=
out magazines, politics, culture, and so forth.=20

All the info follows. Hope you can make it to something!

cheers,

Andy G.=20

Come join Eileen Myles, Rodrigo Toscano, Christina Strong, Laura Sims, Lawr=

 Cannot Exist #4,
a magazine edited by Andy Gricevich of Madison, WI devoted to overlap
between politics, philosophy, and poetry. Presentations and readings
will be followed by an open conversation about the politics of magazine
culture--how the small magazine can affect politics and establish a
cultural commons.

Great Hymn of Thanksgiving
takes place at a dinner table, where the sounds of conversation have
been replaced with fragmented news reports, scraps from the Army prayer
manual, faux-Middle-Eastern folk tales, and disembodied cries of
emergency.=C2=A0 The sculpted sounds of the table itself -- scooting chairs=
,
singing wineglasses, squeaking forks -- force this "conversation" into
a confrontation with material reality.

In Conversation Storm,
three friends from three sides of the political spectrum unwillingly
argue their way through a ticking time bomb scenario, revising,
dissecting, and even brutalizing their own positions in the process --
but time has either stopped or entered an ugly loop, and as the friends
assign and reassign roles, the scenario begins to dissolve the
boundaries between real and hypothetical, past and future, day and night.

Depends on a number of variables, but I think immediately of Craig Dworkin,
Brian Kim Stefans and Darren Wershler-Henry as four (including Christian)
contemporary writers who have, in various ways, elaborated on the Oulipo
project in the 21st century.

Perhaps more disturbing:

The Presidential Oath of Office prescribed by the Constitution reads: "I do
solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of
President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.â€ Chief
Justice John Roberts flubbed it

when administering the oath to Barack Obama by saying: â€œ"That I will execute
the Office of President to the United States faithfully."



Roberts later administered the oath to Obama correctly.



If I had written â€œRoberts later correctly administered the oath to Obama,â€ I
would have emphasized the correctness of administering the oath a second
time, rather than the correctness of the order of the oathâ€™s words. In this
case, word order changes the meaning. Syntactically, however, it makes no
difference whether faithfully precedes execute or follows United States:
both expressions mean the same thing.  The real error lies in the
substitution of to for of: one cannot â€œexecute to.â€ Still, everyone who
knows the oath understood the significance of Obamaâ€™s taking it; the
confusion involved a mere slip of the tongue, not an avalanche obliterating
understanding.



The White House graciously maintained that Roberts performed the do-over
"out of an abundance of caution." Presumably, such caution had prompted him
to ask Obama, after administering the oath the first time, â€œSo help you
 God?â€â€”without waiting for the new President to volunteer the phrase
himself. Whether the Presidentâ€™s "So help me Godâ€ represented his conviction
or just a  courtesy to an already embarrassed Chief Justice remains open to
speculation, but seems largely irrelevant because it might involve a merely
personal conviction.



It might prove more worthwhile to ask whether the Founding Fathers regarded
the oath as a magical incantation which the President-elect must chant
precisely in order for it to transubstantiate him from an ordinary Joe into
the sort of anointed planetary demigod  Obamaâ€™s predecessor seems to have
considered himself. Certainly Washingtonâ€”who declined regal titles, and who
presided over a fragile backwater among nationsâ€”would not have accorded the
oath such abracadabric efficacy, even if he did say â€œSo help me Godâ€ after
taking the oath (as only Washington Irving, some 65 years latter, averred).



Does the oath of office cast a spell? Must hierophant and initiate repeat
its exact words in their exact order? Does the meaning of each word, then,
matter at all? Suppose an imposter priest said the Mass in Latin without
knowing a word of that language, but performed the ceremony precisely. Would
that alone consecrate the Host? Or if an ordained pederast priest performed
the Mass, would his sin, like the imposture of the bogus priest, nullify the
sacramental nature of the consecration?  The Churchâ€™s practice of
reassigning such miscreants to other parishes where they continued to say
Mass suggests otherwise. Would believers have failed to receive communion in
such cases, despite the fervor of their faith? Would their faith compensate
for their priestsâ€™ faithlessness? Would saying â€œI wed theeâ€ rather than â€œI
thee wedâ€ nullify a marriage? Perhaps; perhaps notâ€”let theologians dispute.



The Constitution, however, remains a thoroughly secular documentâ€”however
much various â€œstrict constructionistsâ€ act as if they seem to believe
otherwise. Precisely those people would call for the exact phrasing of the
oath, yet they profess allegiance to the intent of the Foundersâ€”something
not always

apparent in the text of the Constitution. The applied poetics of this
situation remains perplexing.

thank you David for the Gitmo/Gaza links.

Zizek offers some clarity in his essay "Rumsfeld's Unknown Known, or Iraq's Initiation Into Democratic Practice"

After citing Rumsfeld's "amateur philosophizing" Zizik adds a Fourth term:
"unknown knowns."

"These are the disavowed beliefs, suppositions, and obscene practices we enact but don't allow ourselves to see, and which-via practices such as outsourcing-are becoming increasingly easy to ignore."

...soon, we encounter what Zizek calls the "innovative practice of sharing a dirty secret."

Welcome to the Neighborhood=20


       Within the realm of the poem are communities in which constellatio=

poets reside with their poems, and their journeys and influences, books,=20=

poetics and colleagues, and where they were born and where they work, and=
=20
the color of their dogs, cats and washing machines. Of course, individual=
 poets=20
have individual lives and spheres. However, in order for their poetry to=20=

expansively thrive and develop, there must be a place for them to do so.=20=

There has to be a place for poets to be poets, which is to say people. I =
liken=20
these locals to networks of waterways where the wandering flocks gather t=
o=20

singing. Without these vast neighborhoods of mind there would be no poetr=
y.=20
For communities of creativity to form and function, we, the poets, need t=

know who we are. This book is the imagination's welcome wagon. Hello.

A good starting point is *The Oulipo Compendium*, published by MAKENOWPRESS:
http://www.makenow.org/books.htm

Another great book of poetry in the vein of "Eunoia" is *Sleeping with the
Dictionary*, by Harryette Mullen.

Good luck!

New lingua franca upsets French
Friday, 23 January 2009

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7844192.stm


Monsieur Nerriere is a retired French businessman who one day in the
course of his work made a fascinating observation.

In a meeting with colleagues from around the world, including an
Englishman, a Korean and a Brazilian, he noticed that he and the other
non-native English speakers were communicating in a form of English
that was completely comprehensible to them, but which left the
Englishman nonplussed.

He, Jean-Paul Nerriere, could talk to the Korean and the Brazilian in
this neo-language, and they could understand each other perfectly.

But the Englishman was left out because his language was too subtle,
too full of meaning that could not be grasped by the others.

In other words, Monsieur Nerriere concluded, a new form of English is
developing around the world, used by people for whom it is their
second language.

It may not be the most beautiful of tongues, but in this day and age
he says it is indispensible. He calls the language Globish and urges
everyone - above all the French - to learn it tout de suite.

In his book Don't Speak English, Parlez Globish, Monsieur Nerriere
sets out the rules.

Globish has only 1,500 words and users must avoid humour, metaphor,
abbreviation and anything else that can cause cross-cultural confusion.

They must speak slowly and in short sentences. Funnily enough, he
holds up the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as an excellent
exponent.

Many in France consider Monsieur Nerriere a traitor for promoting the
dreaded Anglais, but he insists he is not.

He says the French have to recognise that the language war is lost.

"We're just urinating on the ashes of the fire," he says. We should
look on Globish not as a triumphant cultural vehicle for les Anglo-
Saxons, but as a tool, he says: essential but purely utilitarian.

Please join us today, this Monday, January 26th @ 2:30 p.m. for a talk by
Ben
Bedard:

"Germination: A Transatlantic Genealogy of the Little Magazine"

Ben Lyle Bedard grew up in Maine, and studied creative writing, first at the
University of Maine at Farmington where he served as acting director of the
cooperative poetry press, Alice James Books, and then at Mills College in
Oakland, California where he received his MFA.  He is currently working on
his dissertation on the material representation of modern poetry at the
University of Buffalo.  His poetry has appeared in *BlazeVOX, fhole, Damn
the Caesars*, *Yellow Edenwald Field, **ArtVoice* and *P-Queue*.  His
material adaptation of the cuneiform tablets of the Ugaritic epic KRT
appeared in the Fall/Winter 2005 issue of *Ninth Letter*.  His reviews of
poetry have appeared in *ArtVoice*, *Jacket*, and *The Danforth
Review*.  His
first chapbook, published by Punch Press in 2008, is *Implicit Lyrics*.


********

Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

elaborating, since the Mayer and Mayer / Bernstein exercises are so similar
to OuLiPiian algorhythms (and many of them are), that more than Lee Ann
Brown's Polyverse, most any Poetry Project workshop students from the 80s
are OuLiPo-influenced

Goldsmith sez at Drunken Boat he considers OuLiPo to have been a "toolbox"

I thought someone would reply to Frank Rich's NYT column titled, "No Time
for Poetry." Although I agree with most of what Mr. Rich says, the title he
chose, and its premise, continues the misnomer among most Americans that
poetry is about "flowery language" not fit for serious conversation. It's an
old perception, especially in the US, and obviously continues to this day.
Obama's speech aside, while first-rate musicians were chosen, a minor poet
was chosen to perform for that momentous occasion. There are so many
first-rate poets who could have been chosen! It seems that poetry is so
little thought of that the decision was political, not aesthetic. And
nothing says this better that the title of Frank Rich's column.

Best,
Joel

Court Building, 2 Daly Avenue (at Nicholas), lovingly hosted by rob mclennan.

ottawater would like to thank designer Tanya Sprowl, Emily Falvey from the
Ottawa Art Gallery, the ottawa international writers festival, and Randy
Woods at non-linear creations for their continuing support.

Founded to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the City of Ottawa, Canada's
glorious capital city, "ottawater," and its chemical formula/logo
"O2(H2O)," is a poetry annual produced exclusively on-line, in both
readable and printable pdf formats, and found at
(http://www.ottawater.com). An anthology focusing on Ottawa poets and
poetics, its first issue appeared in January 2005, 150 years after old
Bytown became the City of Ottawa.

Long seen only as a town still echoing its origins as a backwater
Victorian lumber town, and made up of bureaucrats and technocrats, and a
more conservative poetics, "ottawater," edited by Ottawa-born writer,
editor and publisher rob mclennan, exists to remind readers of what work
is happening, and has been happening for years, despite government types
insisting on repeating that the arts in Ottawa is about to begin. We say
instead: we have always been here

We can look at this newly developing condition in a different way, not as
creating a more primitive language 9only 1500 words and short sentences,
etc.); but a language with its own emphases, which in time will create its
own complexities.

to me, the most interesting and influential aspects of the oulipo are not
particular constraints/forms, nor particular works written in those forms,
but aspects at a higher level.

the oulipo grew out of a synthesis of bourbaki/mathematics/logic and
literature. bourbaki was a collective of mathematicians who redefined the
writing of mathematics. a very writerly group in that sense. their books
influenced a generation of mathematicians who had to learn how to present
their work in bourbaki-like style for the journals. bourbaki stressed the
importance of writing to mathematics, brought it to a new level of concern
in mathematics, as opposed to the naive approach where 'a proof is a proof
independent of how it is presented'. for instance, bourbaki eschewed
reliance on pictures. that's a bit much, to me--pictures are so useful in
understanding math, even when the writing is good--but at the time I suppose
it was an important thing to do, to develop writing. I'm a visual kind of a
guy but I value good writing, also.

Another strong influence of Bourbaki on the Oulipo was the Bourbaki concern
with the axiomatic method, the development of math from first principles.
When you define a set of axioms, one may say one is defining a form. One may
find models that satisfy those axioms. For instance, spherical geometry
satisfies a certain set of non-euclidean axioms. Spherical geometry
satisfies the form of those axioms. Spherical geometry is an instantiation
of the class which is the set of non-Euclidean axioms. Spherical geometry is
the object. The axioms are the class, the form.

Similarly, the constraint is the class, the form. The particular work
written to the constraint is the object, the instantiation of the
class/form.

The computer arose from the turing machine. There would have been computers
without the Turing machine, but the Turing machine provides a mathematical
framework for the theory of computation that aides the development of the
computer like any really strong theory aides engineering. The Turing machine
arose from the development of the foundations of mathematics. From the
efforts of Leibniz, Frege, Boole, Cantor, Hilbert, Godel, Turing, and many
others. As discussed in Martin Davis's brilliant book 'Engines of Logic'
which I hope you finally get around to reading.

Now, it is that program, that development of the foundations of mathematics,
which is the inspiration of Bourbaki. And so, in a sense, it is that same
program which is a strong influence on the Oulipo.

And that program--again, as discussed by Martin Davis--is very much
involved--you could even say is intensely engaged with--language. The
development of the foundations of mathematics and the computer are intensely
engaged in the development of the language of symbolic language and
meditation on the general properties of language.

So that we begin to see a 'through-line' from Leibniz to contemporary
digital poetry. With the development of the foundations of mathematics,
mathematics begins to look into language itself as an object of study rather
like particles are an object of study in physics, and so there begin to
arise syntheses of mathematics and poetry that further that intense
engagement with language.

Drawing together thought and feeling, the left and the right, the analytic
and the associative, the representation and the abstraction.

this is great, miekal!  i've been looking at this for quite a while,
because the "war" over pidgin in hawai'i has been so prominent (while i
lived there, i met a businesswoman who said proudly that her company had
not hired some young people because, though their english was good in the
interviews, they spoke pidgin at lunch) and because i've been working for
a grad student (now doctor) in linguistics from korea who's been looking a
this same phenomenon.  rather than expecting exact american or english
english with the "right" accent, what's developing is a focus on being
understood across cultures.  it's really fascinating and exciting to me,
who grew up in many different countries, surrounded by different
languages.  lucky me...  g

Zebulon recording from last night


Here's a recording of the set Myk Freedman (lap steel), Azure Carter
(voice), and I (acoustic electric, tamburitza, ukulele) did last night at
Zebulon. The original recording was incredibly noisy - I did what I could
to sweeten it with CoolEdit. I'm quite happy with the music. In order -
all accompanied by Myk -
1 - w/ acoustic electric. This is the worst recorded - string buzz is much
too noticable. Fast tempo.
2 - w/ Azure, melody and voice, and tamburitza - slow then jump rhythm
3 - w/ ukulele - this needed a contact mike - I was thinking of Henry
Grimes' percussion along the way.
4 - w/ acoustic electric - high-speed quotes outside potential wells.

That's about it - enjoy - Alan

"The First 100 Days of

haptic drawings & commentary, etc. The texts vary, but here is the start of
yesterday's text - from "Obama: Day Five" to give a brief clue of some

This afternoon I went to a poets=A2 panel at the San Francisco Museum of Ar=
t (Joinery: Poems on the occasion of Martin Puryear)
. Subject: Martin Puryear, an African-American sculptor who works
primarily in wood. (Go to the SFMOMA website, among others to see
photographic samples of the work). The poets included:David
Levi-Strauss (moderator & poet & critic), and poets, Norma
Cole, Aaron Shurin, Susan Thackery, and Michael Palmer. All of whom
spoke well about interpreting the work, some from the point of view of the =
ways in
Puryear=A2s practice of =A1joinery=A2 mirrored various aspects of the makin=
g of their own poetry - in terms of collage, and/or the translation
process of working or joining English to another language. Others spoke
directly to the psychological experience of responding and
incorporating the work in the process of both looking and ...

The way this story was told 10 years ago was that while English is
spreading all over the world, it is a thin English, with a very small
vocabulary and fewer tenses, moods and voices than that used in,
say, Britain.

Good thing they lost it. Now maybe they can get back to writing great literature, which has stagnated since they French language council was created. This is where Leftist micromanagement of all the aspects of one's life will get you. You can't stagnate the language like that and expect literature to thrive.

Hello everyone,

As some of you may know, Blackbox experienced recent and rather severe
problems, especially with submissions that were lost in transmission.  After several
failed attempts to receive said submissions, I've decided to put together a
short Fall Gallery and leave it at that.  I had intended a much larger
Fall/Winter combo, but Winter will now have to wait.

I've been informed that many computers are experiencing communication
problems due to Mercury retrograde (or whatever that virus is named).  Perhaps this
is the source of my and others' difficulties.

A short Fall Gallery should be online now.

Best, Bill (William James Austin)

Hello List.
I wonder if anyone can help me: a friend asked me for information about a
sound poet from Brasil, Jamil Jorge, and she has me pretty stumped. Of
course, as ever when you're looking for something rare, there's a fabulous
recording on Ubu, but I am writing this in the hope of finding some more
information, biography, contact details, websites,
publication/recording-info, whatever you may have basically.

Thank-you in advance for any information you may have.
Yours,
Colin.

suggested donation $10 (pay what you can)
reservations required, call 773.281.0824

Have you ever wondered how to improve your sleep hygiene, what it is like to be a flight attendant, or why there were marches for the right to be bellhops in Atlanta in 1930? If you are naturally inquisitive, this is the open house for you.  We will have an ASK ME! party in which we take turns playing the expert. The area/s we ask you about can come from experience, employment, training, study, hobby, obsession or life circumstance. Or, just come to learn. Join us for the pleasures of food, drink, and live human interaction.  Example topics from our household:  insomnia (personal experience), civil rights testing (employment), Batman (study), understanding packrats (life circumstance), Tamms supermax prison (training), and the unofficial history of the Stone Mountain Confederate monument (obsession).  Expect to eat delicious Tempeh Reubenettes!
Co-sponsored by Laurie Jo Reynolds and Scott McFarland.

what happened to Esperanto?=A0 & as Eir=EDkur =D6rn Nor=F0dahlas pointed ou=
t, I like the idea of exposing language, rather than mastering it. Honing i=
nto any given vernacular. Sort of the
way Venturi approached architecture. What's so bad about the mobile
home? It's perfectly functional. Why can't it be beautiful?



It would be funny if someone tried to do with language what Bertrand Russel=

did with mathmatics. Not provide a proof, but devise something so
rational, no 2 speakers could possibly misunderstand one another. =0A=0A=0A=

James Lovelock and climate change.

With his 90th birthday in July, a trip into space scheduled for later in
the year and a new book out next month, 2009 promises to be an exciting
time for James Lovelock. But the originator of the Gaia theory, which
describes Earth as a self-regulating planet, has a stark view of the
future of humanity. He tells Gaia Vince we have one last chance to save
ourselves - and it has nothing to do with nuclear power

Your work on atmospheric chlorofluorocarbons led eventually to a global
CFC ban that saved us from ozone-layer depletion. Do we have time to do
a similar thing with carbon emissions to save ourselves from climate change?

Not a hope in hell. Most of the "green" stuff is verging on a gigantic
scam. Carbon trading, with its huge government subsidies, is just what
finance and industry wanted. It's not going to do a damn thing about
climate change, but it'll make a lot of money for a lot of people and
postpone the moment of reckoning. I am not against renewable energy, but
to spoil all the decent countryside in the UK with wind farms is driving
me mad. It's absolutely unnecessary, and it takes 2500 square kilometres
to produce a gigawatt - that's an awful lot of countryside.

The Spicer film is wonderful. Made me homesick for high school - when given=
 that kind of permission to do something creative like this.=20
Be perhaps interesting to see the poem done 'transgressively' - say, in bla=
ck face, as a way to explore further the implications ('significances') of =
'signs'. Just a thought.

If interested, "Ocean Beach", my piece up on the current Jacket #36 explore=
s Spicer 's "No one listens to poetry" by going down to the beach - here in=
 San Francisco - to make haptics and study the implications of poem in the =
context of an actual ocean.=20

Thanks again for 'the lead.'=A0=20

On January 26, 2009 Milos Sovak died after a long illness.  Our =
friendship had lasted over thirty years & gave me the opportunity to =
work with him on a series of translations, the most important a book of =
selected poems from the great Czech modernist Vitezslav Nezval & =
scattered poems from the late Russian Romantic Mikhail Lermontov.  Our =
collaborations took place mainly in the sunlit garden of his home in =
Encinitas, California, & occasionally at his other home in Provence, =
close to Mazan & the chateau & theater of the Marquis de Sade.  Milos =
was himself a gifted translator into Czech & the designer, typographer, =
& publisher of limited edition artists' books through his own Ettan =
Press in California.  He was a good friend to many poets & artists, & =
most remarkably an important medical researcher & the inventor of an =
impressive range of devices in many fields.  The felicities in our =
collaborations are largely of his doing.

=20

Our translations from Nezval can be found in Antilyrik & Other Poems, =
published by Green Integer Press in 2001, and most of our translations =
from Lermontov appear in Poems for the Millennium, volume 3.  Examples =
from both poets, along with the preceding note, have just been posted on =
my blog, poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com.

Check out the Universal Language movement whose roots go back to the
1700s & has fostered dozens of attempts at such a beast.

One of my favorites is Alwato devised by Stephen Pearl Andrews, the
founder of Modern Times, an early intentional community on Long

Isn't this what Laura Riding intended with Rational Meaning? Something alon=

those lines at least. She obviously never made it that far - renouncing
poetry on her way and still language kept slipping from under her grasp.

Subject: Call for International help against eviction of COX18 and all
the other squatts and free social centers in Milan/Italy
To: seamascain@gmail.com


Hello,

The past one, was a sad and angy week for people living in Milan/Italy.
Milan's social and cultural life was stricken hard once again. At 7am on
january the 22nd around 100 policemen entered the squatt COX18
(http://www.cox18.noblogs.org), which include in its premises the social
center created more than 33 years ago, the Calusca City Light bookstore,
founded in 1971, and the Primo Moroni Archive. Looking at the Expo2015 that
will take place in Milan, the Municipality ask for legal possession of some
buildings in town in order to sell them and earn money. The words of the
Vice Mayor De Corato were clear: we want to close all the free social
centers and squatts in Milan, after COX18 and Pergola Tribe, will be the
turn of Cantiere and Torchiera (other 2 important places of free culture in
town).

We at Digicult, supporting COX18 and all the squatts and social cultural
centers in town, ask to all the people that belive in cultural freedom, in
the importance of the existance of places of free voice and ideas, that are
against repressive policies against free spaces, to follow and help us as
much as you can internationally. Spread this call and the future ones and
sign the Online Petition here:
http://www.petitiononline.com/cox18/petition.html

----------

At 7am on january the 22nd around 100 policemen entered the squatt COX18,
which include in its premises the social center created more than 33 years
ago, the Calusca City Light bookstore, founded in 1971, and the Primo Moron=
i
Archive. The importance of this archive is stunning: it is, without any
doubt, the most important treasure of memory, books, videos, registrations
and a considerable portion of counterculture in Milan and in Italy. At the
present moment the squatt is sealed and under seizure with all the material=
s
inside, the books and the magazines of the bookstore and the archive
included. The damage is unbelieveble!!!.

COX18 was a place where one could encounter people and ideas, where prices
were accessible for all and where discrimination never took place. A place
for concerts, workshops, screenings, presentations, meetings, art
installations, crossing from different art-forms, many of those related to
electronic and digital culture.
The Milan town municipality is trying to turn the city into a huge
commercial centre, destroying all forms of cultural alternatives and closin=
g
down all those spaces where cultural elaboration is not subject to a purely
market-oriented vision. It's a processes that is still ging on from the las=
t
15 years. We are not in for this.
We won't abandon this city. We are going to stay here and fight for the
right to have free social and cultural spaces destined to free forms of
expression.

The morning of 22nd, a lot of people arrived in via Conchetta (the street i=
n
which COX18 lives) to defend the social center against the eviction, then
from  4.00 pm in a spontaneous demonstration and call to everybody and to
everything to converge at Palazzo Marino, Milano town hall, for a
participated and determined demotration for Cox18 and against the evictions=
.
After this demonstration, many other initiatives were organized in the days
after, both on the Internet and on the Streets. There was a big response
from intellectuals, people of culture, normal people from all ages. A big
concert was organized in a big square in Ticinese disctrict (the same of
COX18) and a big mobilitation was a great success on Saturday, January the
24th, against the eviction of the Cox18

At the moment there is a civil case to define the right of ownership of
bulding and of the Archive: of course, many other cultural initiatives will
be organized in the next days, many words will be written, many concerts
will be organized in public spaces of the town, a big national mobilitation
will be organized and the Internet will be our friend to spread the word of
what is happening against Free Culture in Milan/Italy in this historical
moment

best and thanks to all
Marco Mancuso / Digicult

LET'S TAKE BACK COX18, CALUSCA AND THE PRIMO MORONI ARCHIVE

At 7am on january the 22nd around 100 policemen entered the squatt COX18,
which include in its premises the social center created more than 33 years
ago, the Calusca City Light bookstore, founded in 1971, and the Primo Moron=
i
Archive. In a matter of a few hours, the answer of the city was explicit, a
number of comrades, friends and neighbourhoods, gathered in front of the
squatt and the armoured police units to confront the unwelcomed guests.

It's clearly an illegal eviction which doesn't consider a legal action
already going on since july 2008 between the city administration and the
squatt COX18 with the sole purpose of taking legal possession of the
building. Vice Mayor De Corato, one the main heads trying to suffocate
whatever isn't uniformed, gives the responsibility of the action to head of
the police and the regional administration. The DA affirm he wasn't informe=
d
of anything until the eviction was on. Not a real problem, cause all the
protagonists agree on the fact that the economic value of the building
shouldn't loose value. They're talking about money and economic interest as
if this was a reasonable explanation for what is going on.

At the present moment. the squatt is sealed and under seizure with all the
materials inside, the books and the magazines of the bookstore and the
archive included. The COX18 squatt, the Calusca Bookstore and the Primo
Moroni Archive represent an important piece of radical and workers' history=
;
they testify the possibility to elude the principle of commercialization of
things and thoughts.We're not alone, we got the company of others squats,
places of free expression and exchange of ideas. Our survival is the
survival of freedom of expression, thought and action; of the chance to
master our own destiny and future, of any chance not to be judged and
considered for what we can/want to spend.

It's pretty clear we don't consider this 'game' close, we recognize the one=
s
refusing the homogeneity of monolithic thought guaranteed by the market and
this pseudo democracy: they want us compatible, buyers and buyable, ordered
and uniformed, we'll remain what we know we are: original, always ready to
spread knowledge, not homogenous and critical to whatever is imposed as
truth.

----------

FACTS AND CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE EVICTION

It's not correct to read at warm the eviction of the Cox 18, historical
social center of street Conchetta in Milan, besides center of the bookshop
Calusca and the Primo Moroni's archives. Mobilization against the eviction
is in progress, and the Cox eviction is not a closed fact. The eviction
occures on January 22  after a question in Parliament against Milan social
centers adressed, on January 21, to the Home Affair Minister Mr Maroni the
notorious vice-mayor, and public safety alderman and parliamentary, Mr
Riccardo De Corato.

Certainly this eviction as well as a value in practice, has a great symboli=
c
value in order to state power of abuse over the city by certain
administrators  sheriffs in double- breast jacket protagonists of politics
based upon evictions of social center in order to support private interest
of  meddlers and ndrangheta members who see Milan at the center of a vhirl
of business for the future Expo. A moltitude of people mobilized this
morning since dawn after the first news about Cox18 eviction . After some
hours from the garrison of street Conchetta was born a blockage directed
toward the mainstreet of the city, stopping traffic of one of the most
important metropolis arteries. This morning police intervened under
disposition that town hall has emanated  anadministrative act (act that has
not been proved) in which was signalled the unauthorized occupation of the
bulding.

The eviction occured and after a long negotiation the real estate was
returned by the police to town hall, without clearing away the documents,
books, furniture. At the moment there is a civil case to define the right o=
f
ownership of bulding and we all demand reinstate of ownership to the
occupantes, who after 33 years and a deliberation, made in 1989, that
granted the real estate to them.

The ukiaHaiku festival welcomes your submissions of poems by Friday,
March 13
Note: we are offering new prizes starting at $100 in the "Adult,
Contemporary" category! Please see Haiku about the festival below.

Haiku are blossoming once again among poets new and old as the 7th
annual ukiaHaiku festival quickly approaches. Ukiah's Poet Laureate
Committee invites submissions of haiku by experienced and
inexperienced poets of all ages by Friday, March 13. Haiku are brief
3-line poems that offer a =93snapshot=94 of a scene or a moment in time.
Unlike many other kinds of poems, haiku usually do not include rhyme,
alliteration, or punctuation. For guidelines on how to write haiku,
to read winning poems from years past, and to learn about the
available categories and submission methods, go to www.ukiahaiku.org.
Forms can also be obtained at all of the county's libraries,
including the bookmobile, as well as at Grace Hudson Museum (431 S.
School Street, Ukiah).

Submissions are free in all categories (which are organized by age
group and subject matter) except for the Contemporary Haiku-Adult
Category, which costs $5 for up to 3 poems. Examples of other
categories are "Children, All Topics, K-3rd grade," "Haiku About
Ukiah, 7th-12th grade," and "Traditional Haiku =96 Adult." Prizes are
very modest in all categories except "Contemporary Haiku - Adult,"
for which awards of $100, $50, and $25 are being given this year for
the first time. All winning poems will also be published in a book.

Unless otherwise specified, all haiku can be submitted in either the
traditional (5-7-5 syllable-count) format or the contemporary
(briefer, non-syllable counting) format. Teachers who wish to invite
a poet into their classroom to guide students in writing haiku should
contact Ukiah's Poet Laureate David Smith-Ferri at 467-0468, or email
him at smithferri@pacific.net. For more "how-to" information on
writing haiku, go to www.ahapoetry.com, the website of well-known
haiku poet and ukiaHaiku festival judge Jane Reichhold. The awards
ceremony will take place on Sunday, March 26, from 2-4 p.m. at the
Ukiah Conference Center.

P.S. For those who haven't noticed, "Ukiah" spells "Haiku" backwards!

Friends!  Enemies!  Plunderers of all sorts!

Spread far and wide!

Viking Rock has arrived in Durham!  High Master, that king of all things
loud, angry, and in spandex!, is proud to announce its debut performance!

Tomorrow night!  Friday, January 30th!  9 pm!

Castle Lubenstein: 608 Yancey Street, Durham, NC!!

Midnight on:  dance party/karaoke

Bring a weapon cuz it's gonna get ugly....

About High Master:

Sprung from the hockey & blow torch addled brain of Mr. Chris Huggins (by
day, a jr. high science teacher; by night, a rabid fiend to all that is
evil), HIGH MASTER is the true story of the most awesome, most rockingest,
most mighty viking to have ever lived!  Forget Thor (weakling), forget Odin
(sap), forget Hercules (okay, he's Greek, but forget that mama's boy
anyway), High Master would have put them all under his thumb with just his
pinky!

And yet, before he was so great High Master faced a challenge that he could
almost not overcome:  the dreaded, the evil, the dark, the foul, the stinky=
,
the annoying, the pesky, the dastardly, the criminal, the unkind, the
unthrifty, the really just generally bad DARK LORD UNGR (with an umlaut
(aka: Paul Overton)).

After an epic battle, Dark Lord Ungr (with an umlaut) froze our hero High
Master deep in the icy clutches of a mighty glacier!  and with his mighty
evil, dreaded, stinky, annoying, etc. power, stole the sun and ruled the
earth and subjected all living beings to the most horrendous music
imaginable!  It was a dark, dark, dark future....

And then!  in the year 2355!  a brave and noble and handsome and intelligen=
t
and admirable and handsome and kind to puppies and fearless and generally
awesome SCIENTIST (aka: Ken Rumble) whose shiny green suit gave him enormou=
s
powers of power! invented a time machine called the Ship of Sound!!  But
doomed was all mankind because the Scientist couldn't find a power source
strong enough to make the ship go!  Until, one day, while wandering amongst
the boulders of the wasteland of the future he spied--locked in the icy gri=
p
of a mighty glacier--HIGH MASTER!

Here, of course, was the power source the Scientist had long been searching
for!  He thawed out High Master, taught him the fighting art of Kung Future=
,
put a guitar in his hand, and together, they rocked back thousands of years
in time to confront, again, the evil, hiddeous, etc. etc. DARK LORD UNGR
(with an umlaut)!!!

And High Master and Dark Lord Ungr (with an umlaut) engaged in a most
ferocious battle!  Their blows split mountains, their kicks cracked planets=
,
their swords sang out a bloody symphony of rampant destruction!!

And after days and days and days of battle, when all looked as it would be
lost, the mighty High Master lunged with his sword and impaled the Dark Lor=
d
Ungr (with an umlaut) through the heart!!!!

And so with the Dark Lord Ungr (with an umlaut) defeated and the sun
restored, mighty High Master with the trusty Scientist and a mighty horde o=
f
dancing YETTIS!! launched out on the SHIP OF SOUND to right wrongs, battle
evil, and generally rock off the faces of every creature in the whole entir=
e
universe!!!

Some say (whisper even at times) that High Master and his brave crew
encountered other masters of musical mayhem on their adventures -- rumors
(scarcely to be believed) include names like Rainbow Pony Squad, Pep=E9 La
Douche, and Def Sentence, heroes, too, in their own right, but that, my
friends, is a story for another day.....

yours in rock,
Ken

Well, maybe let's take a step back. I think it's important to
distinguish between something being readable as code and actually
being code. I tend towards a sort of hardcore formalism adopted more
or less wholesale from wittgenstein as the foundations of mathematics
are concerned, meaning on my view at least explicit mathematical
symbols of the sorts that computers can operate on are actually a
funny kind of sign that are of a different sort from usual
signifiers.   We can read a what goes into and out of computers as
code because it's explicitly coming from a very code heavy part of
our language. This is qualitatively different in my view from what
happens with, for example, RNA sequences where what we see is
readable as code, and that the function of of rhibozomes is to
respond based on what the structure of the RNA sequence "says" but I
think moving from that point to saying that what we can interpret as
code because it makes sense to us given how we use language actually
IS code is something that I think is not self evident. Not saying a
case can't be made, just that it needs making.

on the other hand, what we have in brain function are all manner of
non explicit symbols. in fact, and I may be jumping off a bit of a
cliff saying this, one might argue that universals are in fact non-
explicit symbols and therefore given that consciousness and thought
as we understand them seems to require that sort of abstraction, and
given that so much abstraction needs universals to be done, that this
is the fundamental place where the idea of machine intelligence being
acquired by something made up of two state transistors falls apart.
because, claims made by object oriented programmers aside, I don't
know that there is a way to get a computer to understand and work
with a universal. you can't reduce a universal to an explicit list of
characteristics, which is where the whole problem of universals comes
from in the first place. Of course, saying this, its probably
important that I qualify it by saying I ascribe to Wittgensteins
theory of universals which rejects both nominalism and realism and
holds that universals are like family resemblances. Which is to say I
may be question begging her because I think from the get go that you
can't get at human thought or even human grammar for that matter
through a set of explicit rules. At least not on it's own.

A couple notes here on why I think this is so:

1.) it is possible for humans to understand the semantic content of
expressions that are not well-formed, this is particularly true of
native speakers in their first language. something that requires
explicit code for decision making or interpretation can't do this and
requires error handling algorithms to be able to cope with it. It
doesn't seem to me that what humans do with statements that are not
wellformed is similar to error handling. Instead we muddle through
working on conjecture and intuition and as a result language can
sometimes be extended in a way that it doesn't seem that machines
would be capable of. A specific example might be the emergence of
trade languages, creoles and pidgins in populations where there are
many different mutually unintelligible languages spoken.

2.) Humans have an extremely high tolerance for vagueness. In fact, I
think vagueness is probably one of the greatest allies of human
intelligence. I can say and do all manners of utterly vague things
and still expect to be understood and reacted to perfectly. the best
example here is probably indexical expressions, something I've been
absolutely fascinated with in my poetic practice over the years. that
we can do so much with "here, there, this and that" the most non-
explicit of symbols we have that we never the less have no trouble
working with and using constantly. I think probably it's useful here
to distinguish between indexicals and something akin to an algebraic
variable. What's important about variables is that while they can
have any value or at least any of a set of values in an equation they
are also defined by the equation in which they occur, all the symbols
of which are explicit, including other variables. Contrast that with
the expression "There." Imagine that I'm standing in a room giving
some one instructions about where to put a painting. I might say
there and point. When I point I'm not defining an explicit place, but
rather giving a vague direction which the other person then has no
trouble following. In fact i might not even point. If the person and
I know each other well enough, they might be able to interpret my
meaning based solely on my unconscious body language. There may then
be some testing that goes on to get to agreement. The person will
hold the painting against the wall and say "here?" At this point an
explicit place has been definied by the painting's being there, but
it is ONLY defined by the paintings being there, and suppose that the
persons hands are shaking and the painting is not in a specific place
but rather in a vague portion of the wall. I might then agree and or
disagree, and if i disagree give some more vague instructions "up a
bit, right a little, left a lot" etc. I think if you compare this to
the complex set of instructions that would have to be programmed into
a robot to do the same task, you'll get an inkling of where I'm going
here. The difference, I don't think at least, is not that humans are
making all kinds of calculations and operations subconsciously in
following these simple directions, but rather that we have a very
high tolerance for vagueness that grows out of the fact that our
thinking doesn't use explicit symbols in the way that a machine
intelligence would have to. Lots of thought experiments can be found
in science fiction about this whenever a machine intelligence is
shown to go haywire due to it's inability to cope with vague
instructions resulting from circumstances its not programmed to cope
with or an over literal interpretation of vague instructions given to
it.
