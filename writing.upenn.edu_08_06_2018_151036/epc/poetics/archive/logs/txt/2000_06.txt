I was recently reading a book called "Beat Spirit" by
Mel Ash, and in it he talked about a deck of cards
Michael McClure would make to stimulate his
creativity. Does anyone have any further information
on how he used it? I am looking for interviews or
writings where he might offer further insight into its
construction and use.
Thanx!

Just came across a cool webpage y'all might wanna check out. www.bigtable.com has an interesting burroughsesqe (gods help me if anyone ever uses the suffix "esque" on my name, a friend actually did once and I gave 'em hell since I was more influenced by the individual in question than they were by myself 'cause they never even heard of me so no "anxiety of influence" there) cut-up program.  I'd like to get a program that does the same thing only more so. Hundreds upon hundreds of pages of my own writings, scribblings, poems, fragments and found materials all tossed into a cut-up computer blender. If anyone knows where such a program can be found, drop me a line and earn my eternal gratitude.

Short Bursts of Electronic Records


Record 1, I'm going to keep my hands off you. I'm not going to ask your
name, or anything. Don't worry, I'm not going near you. I want nothing
whatsoever from you. There are several prepositions locating the two of us
(i.e. in relation to each other) but I not (don't?) think of the two of us
in any grouping whatsoever.

Record 2, I won't get near you. I won't touch you. I want nothing to do
with you whatsoever. I'll stay away from you. No prepositions will bring
us together. You remain at a distance of indifference. That is all I can
do.

Record 3, Let d = infinity. Then 1*n = n; 0*n = 0; d*n =d. 0 and d, at two
ends of the spectrum, are absorbers. Then 1, a form of spectral visita-
tion, returns the same to the same, after the operation. Therefore I am 1
to you; 1*you is you, and this operation, this silent caress, remains
invisible.

Record 1, whatsoever. All of this must be understood whatsoever (this
doubling of the word indicating a break or disconnection between records).

Record 2, There is of course the question of addition, of general recur-
sive functions, but all that is unnecessary (i.e. an afterthought). I
won't go near you, even this speaking, this caress, is at a distance, and
I remain spectral, spectral.

Record 1, You never know when I arrive, but you may mark the date of my
departure. Or you may never be sure I will not return. I have left the
sky different. (Broken, almost forced into the machine. Do they know he or
she has left. Who are they? Who is she? Who is he? Forced out of the mach-
ine, recorded.)

Record 2, But I will never get near you. You'll never see or hear me. I'll
keep my hands off you. I'll keep far away from you. I won't look in your
direction. I won't hear anything you say or see anything you do. I'll stay
away from you. But I will never get near you (etc.).

 I can't speak to the libretto, not having seen / heard it, but I suspect
 there's much happening there with persona, and thus it'd be a slippery
 slope to evaluate the author's attitude toward Romanticism (which carries
 multiple and really very complex strictures vis-a-vis "authenticity" or
 "sincerity") from that.

Patrick:

But we ought not to cop-out from an analytical discussion of such a "complex
engagement" simply because its complexities may daunt us. Bernstein is always
ranting against the Romantic ideology in his prose, be it in an attack of
universalism, or in styles of self-presentation at poetry readings. Yet, yes
he does seem to pose (?) "Romantically" in his poetry at times-- who can
forget the end of _Dark City_? What exactly is happening here? What are the
"multiple and really very complex strictures" of "authenticity" and
"sincerity" here? Is Bernstein "Romantic" without the "Romantic Ideology?" Is
a poet who postures Romantically subverting Romanticism, embracing it, being
Romantic in an other way? Do poets have no choice but to be Romantic, as
Harpo Bloom suggests in _The Visionary Company_?

Yes, good thinking Dave.  For example the all-time bummer _Oedipus Rex_, the
_Oresteia_ trilogy, and _Antigone_, of which a version also exists by the
modern French playwright Jean Anouilh.

Then again, while we're back to the subject of plays, what about O'Neill.
_Long Day's Journey Into Night_ and _Moon For The Misbegotten_ leap to mind,
among others, as well as all those plays by Tennessee Williams which I'm
sure I don't need to name.

But then again, the original question was the dysfunctional family in
POETRY, was it not.  I recall an early Creeley poem titled "Ballad of the
Despairing Husband"-- & I suspect the careful reader could find something
like the theme of the dysfunctional (nuclear) family lurking about in
several other Creeley poems.  Again, I think that the novel or the play are
genres more likely to present this theme....

Beat Generation.  Beginning with the meeting of Allen Ginsberg,
Jack Kerouac and Willliam Burroughs in the 40s, the film spans
the counterculture of the past 50 years, looking at the effect of
the Beat movement on art, politics, popular culture and the
important and inevitable presence of the Beat influence today.
The program features interviews with major figures from the era,
including Ginsberg, Leary and Burroughs, extensive archive
material, and dramatized readings by John Turturro, Johnny Depp
and Dennis Hopper."

>>Does anyone know what the origin of Derrida's expression

Doesnt it go back to Hegel? --As to why Derrida chooses to draw attention
via unidiomatic writing, perhaps he didnt want anybody snoozing and thus
losing the full import of the phrase?

Hi,

Not that this answers your question, but Derrida
sometimes plays on "deja" as an abbreviation of
"DErrida, JAcques": "toujours deja" is one of his
"signature phrases", like saying "J.D. woz 'ere" (in
this text) or "Derrida forever!"...

hi Liz

there's always this (tho someone already mentioned 'obvious'):



    Take the brown eyes of my father,
    those gun shots, those mean muds.
    Bury them.
    Take the blue eyes of my mother,
    naked as the sea,
    waiting to pull you down
    where there is no air, no God.
    Bury them.
    Take the black eyes of my lover,
    coal eyes like a cruel hog,
    wanting to whip you and laugh.
    Bury them.

    ...

    They'd like to take my eyes
    and poke a hatpin through
    their pupils. Not just to bury
    but to stab. As for your eyes,
    I fold up in front of them
    in a baby ball and you send
    them to the State Asylum.
    ...


guess who.

I agree, lame film. I actually walked out at one point
and played a game of Tekken. When I returned I felt
like I missed nothing. Stay at home and rent "Carrie".

>>speaking of movies, I just saw The Virgin Suicides,
which though flawed structurally and having a bit of
'blame it all on the bitch mother' kind of
thing, does raise a lot of good issues, among them,
how lame are the cliches being offered to high school
students by their youth-nostalgic parents.  I mean,
how could anyone take a star-studded,
sequined-decorated gymnasium homecoming dance
seriously after the release of the movie Carrie?

***

A quote in honor of the plaque for Allen Ginsberg at 170 E. 2nd St., =
where he wrote "Kaddish" in 1962, and where with Kerouac tossing a =
stale loaf of bread back and forth down street, immortal line =
"walking on water wasn't built in a day" was uttered. (Ceremony was =
this morning, with readings and speeches by Edward Sanders, Bob =
Rosenthal, Regina Weinreich, Bill Morgan, Bill Gargulis, and others =
pleasantly interrupted by urban commotion such as residents of =
building bringing out laundry thru throng of listeners, various =
vehicles going down street, American flag hanging in dusty window =
behind old Singer sewing machine and antelope horns)

His mind kept whispering "kaddish kaddish kaddish...."
on his triumphal return to NYC
after 18 months in Europe
               till one night in mid-November of 1958

Allen was at the pad of a friend
in the West Village named Zev Putterman
They listened to Ray Charles
              Allen chanted from Shelley's "Adonais"

They took some morphine and meth
in a pre-hep-B, pre-AIDS mode of needles and nickel bags

He told the story of Naomi
now dead three years
and when he traced the tale of Naomi denied

               Zev Putterman found a copy and chanted it

The 'Zap walked home from the West Side
to his East 2nd Street pad after the Putterman Kaddish
yearning 'pulsively
               to write

He jotted nonstop from 6 AM Saturday
                              till 10 PM on Sunday
               taking some dexedrine
                                   till 58 pages were done

While this is in a way beside the point, I wish here to express my profound

immediately to mind) who knock themselves out to make marvelous and unique
conferences like the recent get-togethers at the U of Maine possible.

This message seems to be anonymous, so I don't know the source of the
writer's grievance. But as the organizer of an upcoming conference, I'd
like to say a word or two in response to this message.  One form that
paranoia takes in America is the assumption that other people are
"getting away with" something, reaping some sort of benefits that are
unjustly denied to others.  So I thought the members of this list might
like to know a little more about conferences--how they are funded, and
what makes them possible.

Yes, we are asking the panelists at the forthcoming National Poetry
Foundation conference ("The Opening of the Field: North American Poetry
in the 1960s") to pay a registration fee.  If we waived the fee for all
panelists, we'd receive virtually no income from the conference
whatsoever, in that at least 80% of the people who come to such
conferences are on the program.  And if we didn't receive some income
from the conference, we couldn't put it on.  We ran deficits of $5,000
on each of the last two NPF conferences, even with the registration
fee.  This year we're hoping to break even, but will probably end with
another (smaller) deficit. Where does the money go?  Primarily, the
University of Maine itself charges NPF a fee for the use of the
campus--even though NPF is a part of the university. (If we moved the
conference to hotels, the cost would soar. We've been able to keep
costs at NPF conference relatively low, as compared with several other
conferences I've attended, by running them during the summer on the
campus.) And we provide help on travel costs for featured speakers,
although we don't come near to covering their full expenses.  In
addition, we have hundreds of miscellaneous expenses--van service for
participants, printing costs, advertising and promotion, etc.

So: it costs us money to run these conferences.  And in addition, the
staff of NPF has, by the time the conference is over, contributed
hundreds of hours of their time to making the conference happen. This
time isn't exactly uncompensated--we're on the university payroll. But
much of it is in fact overload time--I've been spending an average of
at least ten hours a week over the last year working on this
conference, as part of my 60 or 70 hour work-week, which has included
teaching my normal load of classes, trying to keep up with my editing
responsibilities with NPF, and various other administrative
responsibilities.  I and others here at NPF have contributed our time,
not  because we see an opportunity to profit from the naive, or because
we "have to" under the terms of our employment.  We do it because we
want to create a space where people who care about poetry can come
together face to face (electronic communication DOES have its
limitations) to share their passion.

Conferences like ours are made possible by the fact that people with
connections at universities can usually get at least partial support
from their home institutions to cover travel costs and registration
fees. Yes, this means that people without such connections must wing it
on their own.  I'm sorry about that fact--and our anonynmous
complainant is correct when he suggests that this system tends to
separate the academic world from those outside that world. In another
time or place, maybe the government could fund such events, and make
them free to all.  I've applied three times for funding from NEH to
support NPF conferences (at the cost of upwards of 100 hours of my
time, to prepare the proposal), and have been turned down every time.
The people on the NEH review panels have, its seems, never heard of, or
are actively hostile to, the poets we're interested in.

So our correspondent wants to see all such conferences "destroyed."  I
must admit that I feel personally attacked here. Yes, there are
problems in the system.  But is simply destroying what we've got, with
all its limitations, the way to solve these problems?

For twenty years CHARLES WATTS (1947-1998) was the guardian of the
contemporary poetry collection at the SFU library. Special Collections was a
place where generations of young writers discovered the New American Poetry,
the Spicer lectures, Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts, Tish, Wm Blake
facsimiles, the Artaud Anthology, Coach House Press, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, the
H.D. Book, Tender Buttons, Zukofsky's Catullus, Lettrisme, BC Monthly, Allen
Ginsberg, the Vancouver Poetry Conference and a thousand other maddening
inspirations. Often Charles was their guide, perhaps engaging with them in
his own areas of scholarship - Melville and Pound, Beatrice Cenci and
Sigismundo Malatesta - or introducing them to manuscripts, letters and audio
tapes related to their own special fields of interest. In the 1980's Charles
wrote one small powerful book of poetry, Bread and Wine. It was as if a
lifetime of attention to poetry had suddenly come into focus and demanded
expression. There is no evidence that he wrote poetry before or after this
intense exercise of a few years. It is a remarkable book.

GREG PLACONOURIS studied with George Bowering at SFU and hence was
sequestered in Special Collections for some considerable time where he met
and came to admire Charles Watts. Placonouris promises a "memorial
incantatory celebratory reading" of Watts' work, spliced with archival
tapes, such as the famous R2B2 backyard reading, and slides showing Watts in
all manner of array. Mr. Placonouris is the author of Crystal Children, a
collection of fictional and semi-fictional oral anecdotes about the Pacific
North West rave scene. In this context, he has been described as a
"polyphonic Studs Terkel of the rave scene." He has travelled widely on all
eight continents. He has himself been writing poetry for about twenty years.

Kootenay School of Writing
201-505 Hamilton Street
Vancouver BC Canada

RACHEL BLAU DUPLESSIS is the author of an important series of "Drafts" which
have appeared over the past thirteen years in journals of poetic record such
as Temblor, Sulfur, Talisman, Aerial, Hambone, West Coast Line, Parataxis,
Action Poetique and Conjunctions. These "Drafts" have been collected in her
books Tabula Rosa, Drafts 3-14, Drafts 15-XXX: The Fold, all from Potes and
Poets Press, and Renga: Draft 32 (Beautiful Swimmer, 1998). Drafts 1-38:
Toll is forthcoming from Wesleyan in 2001. Her poetry has frequently been
anthologized, most recently in Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative
Writing by Women (ed. Mary Margaret Sloan, Talisman House, 1997).

Her often cited creative essay "The Pink Guitar" appears in The Pink Guitar:
Writing as Feminist Practice (Routledge, 1990). She has published many
critical writings on narrative theory, poetics and the work of modernist
writers such as H.D., Stein, Loy, Moore, Niedecker and Oppen. Her most
recent critical work, Gender, Race and Religious Culture in Modern American
Poetry, 1908-1934 (Cambridge, 2000) offers "deep textual readings of the
social idioms and debates in which early modern poetry participated." She is
also the editor of The Selected Letters of George Oppen (Duke, 1990),
Signets: Reading H.D. (Wisconsin, 1990, with Susan Friedman) and The
Objectivist Nexus (Alabama, 1999, with Peter Quartermain). DuPlessis also
edited, with Ann Sintow, a gigantic collection called The Feminist Memoir
Project (Three Rivers Press, 1998). She describes this as "thirty-one essays
and responses asking what it felt like to live through and contribute to the
massive, many-pronged social movement called feminism."

DuPlessis last read her work in Vancouver in 1995, at which time she also
presented a paper entitled "The Blazes of Poetry: Remarks on Segmentivity
and Seriality with Special Reference to Blaser and Oppen" (published in The
Recovery of the Public World, Talonbooks, 1999).



Her writing re-members and dis-members logical imperatives of masculine
authority. - Susan Howe

Rachel Blau DuPlessis's Drafts 3-14 is maximal poetry. - Jackson Mac Low

Drafts 15-XXX, The Fold, gives rare evidence of a record of time, and
creates a gold sweat, like Tristram Shandy. - Barbara Guest

Rachel Blau DuPlessis is writing a kind of history of the end in which all
knowledge is temporary or tentative, unremembered, censored or distorted,
lapsed, smashed, decayed. - Beverly Dahlen

I know that Husserl used it and sort of assumed that he'd more or less
coined it. But perhaps it goes back before him?

Public Art Opportunities

                   Bay Area Transit Consultants (BATC), on behalf of the
San Francisco Bay Area
                   Rapid Transit District (BART), announces an exciting
opportunity for professional
                   artists to make design contributions to the new South
San Francisco, San Bruno,
                   and Millbrae BART Stations. The three new stations
are part of BART's West Bay
                   Extensions Program, which will add nearly nine miles
of new track and a total of
                   four new stations to the existing BART system. Upon
completion, the West Bay
                   Extensions Program will provide area residents and
visitors with new and efficient
                   commuting options, and increased access to a variety
of social, cultural, and
                   recreational destinations.

                   An orientation on the Art and Design Program will be
held on Friday, June 2, 2000
                   from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The orientation will
provide interested artists with a
                   chance to view each station's architectural design,
meet members of each
                   station's design team, ask questions about the art
and design program, and
                   receive information about each local city. The
orientation will take place at the
                   BATC offices, 979 Broadway, Conference Room 1C,
Millbrae, CA. The orientation
                   is free and all interested artists are encouraged to
attend.

                   ART AND DESIGN PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

                   Each new BART station will have unique and
distinguishing architectural features.
                   Though the architectural design phase for all three
stations is nearing completion,
                   there are challenging opportunities for artists to
make innovative and powerful
                   design statements. Each station contains typical
elements, such as platform
                   walls, columns, flooring, seating, and lighting,
which may be enhanced with an
                   artistic treatment. A wide range of artistic concepts
will be considered for
                   implementation, as long as the artwork does not
negatively impact the station's
                   structural design or architectural integrity.

                   The following briefly describes each of the three new
BART stations.

                   Millbrae Intermodal Station

                   Located at Rollins Road and Millbrae Avenue, just
west of Highway 101, the
                   graceful, pavilion-style architecture of the Millbrae
Station will provide a unique
                   identity as a gateway to the city.

                   The Millbrae Station is noteworthy for its size,
projected patronage, and intermodal
                   features that will provide connections between BART,
Caltrain, and San Mateo
                   County Transit District (SamTrans) buses. The station
spans five tracks, two
                   center platforms, and one side platform. Immediately
adjacent to the station is a
                   five-level, 2,100-space parking structure and
900-space surface parking lots. With
                   patronage projected at 24,000 weekday riders, the
Millbrae Station will become the
                   fourth busiest station in the BART system.

                   The station concourse provides access to boarding
platforms, and serves as a
                   bridge from the west side to the east side of the
station. The bridge function of the
                   concourse is expressed architecturally by the
cable-stayed, long-span roof that
                   echoes the design of Bay Area bridges. In lieu of
more traditional roofing materials,
                   the roof design features translucent tensioned
fabric, which limits the weight and
                   visual mass of the roof and its supporting structure,
and provides increased access
                   to natural lighting. With its exposed steel
structure, large-volume spaces, and
                   arched forms, the station reflects the elegant
aesthetic found in turn-of-the-century
                   train stations.

                   Potential Art Sites

                   1. Metal Fencing

                   A security barrier runs the length of the platform
that is shared by BART and
                   Caltrain and separates the paid area from the
non-paid area. The barrier measures
                   approximately 700' long and 10' high, and transitions
in materials (metal and metal
                   mesh) according to its functional requirements. The
barrier presents an opportunity
                   for artistic treatment, which would elevate it from
its utilitarian function to an
                   attractive and interesting design element. Metal or
metal fabrics that will safely and
                   efficiently perform the required barrier function may
be considered for this site. A
                   similar barrier, located along the first level
perimeter of the parking structure,
                   presents an additional opportunity for artists to
combine function and aesthetics.

                   2. Roof Mast Banners

                   The station's translucent roofing fabric is supported
on a steel armature connected
                   to eight masts. A series of "banners" made of
permanent materials may be
                   considered for this area. In addition to enlivening
the masts themselves, the
                   banners' movement and color would be projected
through the translucent fabric
                   roofing and onto the concourse below.

                   3. Floor Patterns

                   The finish flooring at the platform level is
primarily concrete. A simple pattern
                   consisting of tile bands at each column provides some
relief. The concourse level
                   is completely tiled with a simple orthogonal pattern
that relates to the column
                   lines.

                   The floor patterns at one or both levels could be
augmented, complemented, and
                   enhanced by an artist's design. Potential media
include ceramic, glass or metal
                   tiles, and mosaics.

                   San Bruno Station

                   The San Bruno Station will be located on Huntington
Avenue, immediately adjacent
                   to the eastern side of Tanforan Park Shopping Center.
Designed as a neighborhood
                   facility, it will provide optimal access to nearby
retail and commercial areas.

                   Among the station's unique design elements are a
series of arched roofs over the
                   entrance and the main station area, and exposed,
tubular steel space-frame
                   trusses that support an arched roof system which
defines the station's interior. The
                   trusses will be painted a deep red and are the
primary architectural feature of the
                   station.

                   The concourse level is above grade and features two
main station entrances. The
                   concourse level structure is enclosed with a glass
block and translucent panel
                   system (KalWall) that provides for both weather
protection and the transmission of
                   light into the concourse level.

                   Potential Art Sites

                   1. Concourse Level Panel System

                   The KalWall panel system offers a large surface area
that can be enhanced with
                   an artistic treatment, including one that enhances
and augments day and night
                   time light. A color treatment may also be developed
to enhance the KalWall panel
                   system.

                   South San Francisco Station

                   The South San Francisco Station site is in a valley
between two hills dotted with
                   single family residences. The valley is dominated by
El Camino Real, a major
                   commercial thoroughfare that fronts the station site.

                   The station design is intended to embody forms from
South San Francisco's
                   history. Vaulted metal roofs and translucent glazed
skylights reflect the city's
                   industrial and horticultural traditions. Changes in
the profile and finish of the metal
                   roofing create a "wave" pattern inspired by the
rolling hills in the background. The
                   wave theme is repeated in other elements of the
station's designs, including two
                   decorative awnings that enhance the pedestrian access
path.

                   Potential Art Sites

                   1. Platform Level Cavity Walls

                   The interior faces of the structural concrete walls
of BART stations are subject to
                   staining and deposits due to minor leaks and the
leaching of salts. Cavity walls are
                   provided in front of these walls to shield the stains
and deposits from public view.
                   The cavity walls also provide acoustical treatment to
absorb and dissipate train
                   noise, and provide mounting locations for
advertisement billboards.

                   There are cavity walls on both sides of the station.
Each wall extends the full
                   length of the platform, which is 700 feet long, and
is a point of visual focus for
                   BART patrons. The cavity walls present an ideal
"blank slate" for an artistic
                   treatment.

                   2. Ceiling Accents

                   The primary space-defining theme is the vaulted roof.
The vaulted roof and ceiling
                   step down in height to correspond to the spatial
hierarchy along the patron access
                   path from the station's entrance to the escalators,
elevators, and stairs. This
                   spatial patterning could be reinforced by various
artistic accents, including neon or
                   fiber optic lighting, indirect accent lighting,
and/or color treatment to the slats that
                   form the ceilings.

                   ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

                   All Responders to the RFQ must meet the minimum
qualifications listed below to
                   be eligible for the review of qualifications and
selection of finalists. BATC solicits
                   and encourages the active participation of a diverse
artistic community throughout
                   the qualification and selection process.

                   It is the policy of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid
Transit District to ensure
                   nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex,
or national origin in the award
                   and administration of federally funded contracts. It
is the intention of the District
                   create a level playing field on which Disadvantaged
Business Enterprises can
                   compete fairly for agreements, contracts, and
subcontracts including but not
                   limited to construction, procurement and proposal
contracts, professional and
                   technical services agreements, and purchase orders.

                   A. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

                   1. Experience in working with materials appropriate
for long-term use in an exterior
                   environment and subject to varying weather
conditions, vehicular emissions,
                   pedestrian traffic, and other environmental
conditions particular to rail transit
                   facilities. Each station is located within a marine
climate zone. All proposed
                   materials must be able to maintain their structural
and surface integrity within this
                   environment for at least twenty years with minimal
cleaning and maintenance
                   required.

                   2. Demonstrated experience in successfully completing
site-specific, integrated art
                   projects. This experience may be on art projects of a
comparable nature and
                   scope. Experience in site-specific, integrated art
projects in museums,
                   universities, business campuses, or other settings
will be considered as meeting
                   this qualification.

                   3. Experience in managing the design, fabrication,
and installation of artwork, as
                   demonstrated by a verifiable record of one or more
art projects completed on time
                   and within budget (to be confirmed by professional
references during the first phase
                   of the review and selection process).

                   4. Ability to attend local meetings, as may be
required by BATC, and to be present
                   during the installation of the artwork.

                   Artists who do not have experience in producing
site-specific, integrated art
                   projects are encouraged to apply as a collaborative
team (e.g. partnership, joint
                   venture) with other artists or design professionals
whose professional experience
                   complies with the minimum qualifications and which
will enable the artist to
                   successfully design, fabricate, and install a
commissioned artwork. For example,
                   artists who work in two-dimensional materials may
consider partnering with other
                   artists and design professionals who have experience
with the design, fabrication,
                   and installation of commissioned artwork, and who
work in durable materials, such
                   as tile, metal, glass, etc.

                   The projects are open to professional artists
residing in the United States who
                   meet the minimum qualifications described above. To
obtain a Request for
                   Qualifications please contact BATC at 650-689-8523
and leave your name and
                   mailing address. You may also e-mail a request to:
RALMAGU@BART.gov. The
                   deadline for applications is Monday, June 19, 2000.

I've been searching without success for comparative feminist readings of
narrative and "avant-garde" or "alternative" poetries, hoping to find
something that would argue that narrative, Sharon Olds-ish type work is in
some ways less subversive than a more elliptical or disjunctive work by a
female poet.  If anyone knows of such work, I'd greatly appreciate a top
tip leading me to it -- you can backchannel to dkane@panix.com.

For what it's worth [not much, to Mr. Tranter, apparently]:  Patrick F.
Durgin never posed the question, "How sincere is Bernstein?"  If Mr.
Tranter is suggesting that issues related to the work of Charles Bernstein
are irrelevant on this list, or discussing them here constitutes some sort
of overkill, I would suggest he read the sort of "mission statement" behind
the list, available at the EPC.  If, on the other hand, Mr. Tranter is
suggesting that the question itself is moot[less] and / or tautological, I
would be curious to see some evidence for that suggestion.  As Kevin Davies
writes in an entirely more fulfilling context (i.e., his new book,
_Comp._), "If you don't believe a science, don't misquote it."  He (John
Tranter) has long demonstrated that he is capable of both contributing
(usefully) to and policing such discussions.  Which is it this time?

        "wear it like a badge and you're not a vigilante, you're a

        multi-media artist may also be not self defined, but definition
given by those who don't know where "to put" said artist

        however, multi media artists do exist and many do know how to do
all the acivities such art requires very well

        a simple example is a switch hitter in baseball.

        there is no argument that mickey mantle was a great switch hitter.
        just ask the pitchers he faced.
        or, as caesy stengel was wont to say:  you could look it up

        there are also other meanings to switch hitter, and from what i
hear from a number of authorities in this field these athletes are also
very good

        an example of a multi media artist:  kurt schwitters.


        bpNichol, Karl Young,Bob Cobbing, Clemente Padin, Jackson Mac Low.

Ramez,
        I agree, let's look into it.  Again, I haven't seen or heard the libretto,
so I'm a bit under qualified to take part in the analysis here.  Let me
clarify what gave me pause & inspired my post:
        It was the term "subattitudes."  I wanted to point to what, in my
readings, are quite overt takes, by Bernstein, on the "Romantic ideology."
Many of the gestures in Bernstein's work, poetry as well as criticism, take
for granted that he is always already implicated (which must be close to
what Bloom is saying vis-a-vis poets per se -- though this seems rather
reductive on the surface) in ideology, whether it be that of Romanticism
etc.  That is, I see him making overt admissions of the sort which allow
him to utilize Romantic tropes / techniques where he darn well pleases.
The contradiction you're pointing to is interesting (is the libretto
published? / was anyone else at this reading & wanna pipe up?).  But I
wonder how far it is from the contradictory gesture of touting a Romantic
ideology without overt admission that that is what one is doing.  In my
experience, it is typically those without the courage of their convictions
(this would exclude the most celebrated Romantics, of course) who veil that
ideology as ideology by refusing to admit that any substantial attitude
toward ideology is, perforce, ambivalent, complex.  So, I paused.  & now
I'd like to hear more.
        Patrick

Adam, Norman Mailer etc) not even identified when they were speaking.  to

while i agree w/ much of what has been said about the unavoidably
discriminatory nature of conferences, and i think alternative structures
should be explored and adopted,  i also need to say something in their
defense.  bear in mind that the following is from my perspective only,
reflects my experience, and is meant to supplement rather than contradict
earlier statements from folks who justifiably feel excluded.  if you
compare academic humanists not to writers but to other highly trained
professionals the situation looks different. choosing to be an academic
means, for many, 7 or 8 years of adulthood spent in apprenticeship-like
financial conditions that leave one  in massive debt, with no assurance,
unlike in medicine, business or law (all of which degrees take less time)
that one will be able to pay it back. one is then sent to a part of the
country one has never been to before, and has to start over all alone after
7 or 8 years of developing a community; thi soften results in a few years
lost to simple emotional and synaptical re-orientation.  we are paid better
than we used to be, but compared to other professions of comparable
training periods (medicine etc) we lag far behind in both income and in the
ability to exercise certain kinds of choices about geography, "life-style"
etc.  getting the occasional airfare for the occasional conference where we
can go and see our friends for one day out of the year to remember why we
ever chose to do this is considered compensation for our historically low
incomes, high teaching loads etc compared to others in comparable
positions.  most academics i know at major universities like myself get, at
most, a yearly stipend to cover airfare to one conference, when normally we
go to 6 or 7 a year. i am "lucky" in that i don't have a family to support
i can pay my own way to a few; i am also lucky in that after 12 years in
the profession i am occasionally offered an honorarium --anywhere from $50
to $700, but most often between $200 and $300 -- to defray expenses for a
trip that can cost up to $900.  do i mind?  no, i'm thrilled to be able to
participate.  i love the relative freedom of this profession compared to
science, medicine, law or business.  i am well aware --most acutely through
my collaborative relationship w/ miekal and --of the sharp disjunction
between my situation and those of poets far more talented and original than
i, who have chosen lives that give them complete artistic freedom -- and
who are paying the price in a society where creativity is not even on the
map unless it its designed to make $$ for a handful of CEOs.  do i have the
self-confidence to strike out on my own, leave academia and rely on my
talents as many of you do?  no fucking way.  and conferences --organizing
them but more often participating in them --are one of the few instances
where i can meet kindred spirits, maintain friendships, promote other
people's work, etc.  this is especially true when you don't live in a major
city with a major writing community. i got on POETIX as a result of a
conference (met bernstein at louisville) --in fact, it was through POETICS,
partially, that i connected with writers in my very own town whose
existence i hadn't known about; am going to england in july for the sole
purpose of meeting alan sondheim (at the trAce conference); have learned
about the work of many of you at conferences and through the list. at the
same time, there is almost always (with the possible exception of the
rutgers Poetry and the public sphere conf) something deeply wrong with
every conference i've ever been to --from MLA to the ones i've organized.
they are rife with the politics of exclusion and selection, ideological
blindspots, cruelties both hidden and overt, etc etc.  anyway, i feel as if
i could just as well trash conferences as defend them, but this time around
i wanted to say what they've meant to my intellectual and personal life.
sorry for taking up so much bandwidth, but once i started, i couldn't
stop...

I have to disagree strongly with David Bromige's insistence that you set a
time-limit for your slams. The three-minute rule was in my opinion one of
the worst things to happen to poetry slams since their onset. Why force your
poets to carve their work into commercial break size time slots? Presumably
David just wants to prevent the thing from running on all night long. I
suggest that you limit the number of slammers instead. Invite five or six
poets to slam and have them go through three rounds, one poem per round with
a round of scoring following each poem. Also, mix the poets up as best you
can and try to encourage poets who wouldn't think of themselves as "slam"
poets or as being particularly performance oriented to slam anyway.

I have seen slams run in more than a few different cities, and I've always
remained fondest of the variation practiced at the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe, so
many of my suggestions might follow along the rules laid down there.

RANDOMLY pick five to seven judges and have them rate the poem on a scale of
zero to ten, knock off the high and low and add the remaining scores. That's
the poets score for that round. At the end of the slam the highest combined
score from all three rounds wins. It might also help to have a "sacrificial
goat," that is, someone who isn't going to be competing, but who will read a
first poem so the judges and the audience both have a chance to warm up.

At some point slam seemed to turn into a much more serious competition than
I think it was originally intended to be. When I first started going to
slams at the Nuyorican in the early nineties all you won if you won the slam
was the five dollars that you'd paid to get in. Adding large cash prizes and
such seems to turn the affair into something other than a mock competition.

Bob Holman, who MCeed most of the earlier slams that I went to would often
read a statement which later appeared in Aloud: Voices From The Nuyorican
Poet's Cafe. Sadly, my copy of Aloud is packed away at present, but if you
can find this statement by my description I recommend that you also read it
before your slams. I believe it began with something like "We are here today
because we aren't somewhere else." It encourages the audience to judge the
judges and also reminded us that "the best poet always loses," which was
somewhat gratifying to me because it meant that I walked out the the Cafe as
the best poet at least a couple of times.

Best of luck with your slams. Try to have fun and encourage all other
participants to do the same.

good point mr.nudel, mm brings/allows/encourages convergence and divergence
simultaneously.
we tell our stories, we evoke emotions, we evoke imagery now with text,
image, sound, animation, intelligent agents, i call it cyberpoetry, others
have other names for this new kind of art, webart, net-art, interactive
art, technoliterature, hypermedia, new media, digital art, virtual art(is
this a tautology?), etc., etc., etc..
cheers

I made a promise to Rachel and a promise to Maria that I would not
mention them publicly any more, because one of them was threatened
with academic demotion and the other was told she would have
published her last poetry book if they were associated with me in
anything but a professional way. No more lurking, gin fizz in hand,
behind the indoor plants, damn it.

CONTINUITY GIRL by Chris Tysh

Book design: Brian Schorn

86p.   ISBN 0-935992-10-3      $10.00

"Bold, erudite, witty, feminist & elegantly elegiac, CONTINUITY GIRL is a
sweet surrender that works on the senses with its consummate dissonance &
fierce lingual passion. The language moves & jags are revelatory: "She is
tired/of explaining the etymology/I hear it now: ska yellow fufu/sucking
teeth in/between bites." Chris Tysh rules with this book." Anne Waldman

"A singer with a strong, fine range who can take a subject-verb-object
sentence and blow its horn, Chris Tysh reveal herself as a poet who
commands attention. Her subject is no less than all of life in its bleak
fullness. She hears the rhythms and plays them at the same time." Barbara
Einzig

"Say a spate of vintage Godardian mind, sets by Sade, eyeshade by Duras,
slipping into the darkness and with kisses. A work that goes gorgeous at
any second then clings like one wide open verb. It's the sexual multiple
drawn by a needle high on the body of thought. It's the coruscating Chris
at her most." Clark Coolidge

McClure talks about this in great detail in "Cinammon Turquoise Leather (A
Personal Universe Deck), from v. 1 of -Talking Poetics From Naropa
Institute- (Shambala, 1978).  Out of print, I suspect, but well worth
tracking down--there are also excellent transciptions of talks by Duncan,
Berrigan, Padgett, Cage....

Subject:      m&r..from Alcman to the 'noise' frontier....

    Last week I was a grunt volunteer at the VISION FESTIVAL..out-music's Cannes...taking ticket, sweeping floor, stamping hands...which didn't leave me much time for the Poetry Events...but with my usual sources of inuendo, false rumor & character assass. will try to review them anway...

    They ranged from Rap Poetry-Nadine Mozon- one well-dressed
African American Woman to one well dressed Black Woman- "it;s just a rap poet." I'm not going to touch those two beloved Louisada figures Miguel Algarin..."and who are you, sir"..I AM Miiiiiiiiiiiiguel Algaaaaaaran.." or the six girl-woman entourage-harem that followed Steve Cannon "of course they can get in grats"..

      On Tues the 23rd...while i went home to catch a nap...Steve D. did his usual post Patchen-Kerouac long drone to Stephanie Stone Satieing it on the Piano..the next, last band of the nite was asking back-stage who is this guy and why is he losing our audience..

      David Budbill did his montage of expropriated-jazz quotes to the big band blaring him out as background. Since i heard this last year, i can't say anything but what ANOTHER JAZZ POET sd...'of course, they'd like a guy quoting Jazz Greats to a Jazz Audience"..jazzed stuff..

      One nite i did get out at netZero@thehalf and slogged two blocks north to catch the 2nd half of the bill of Jessica Grimm/Charles Bernstein...lots of fannies in the seats...Mr Bernstein's first was an arch piece on a painting in a Syr. Museum..proving again how long the nites can be on the Niagra Frontier..& I should know since i spend 5 winters there..the audience was amused...the 2nd operatic-libretto...which i'm told was 'daring' was OK...and the third call-response echolalia with tape recorder was experimental..but again this is an audience that if J.C. and A.G. returned in the flesh and did the dirty on stage would walk out wondering what the semiotic meaning was...

     The last reading of the festival promised no more than 30 min..but the important cultural macher/publisher lasted less than 30 secs before she was in the vestibule smoking a cigarette and talking on her cell phone..this was the improv. piece AU COURANT CURRENCIES...yes, Virginia, this is the way people talk on Ave C...with Steve Cannon/Natasha Diggs/Edwin Torres... this experimental piece began with Africa/Asia...again again again...it might as well have been love/dove...same language different apparatus..Mr. Torres did a nice unimprov set-piece love piece..i lasted 15 min. then went to the vestibule to not smoke a cigarette and not talk on the cell phone i don;t have..

     Late Sat. Nite James Blood Ulmer rang chord blues changes on his guitar the whine of which brought us back to the history of black dirt blind blues-playing...the guttural sounds of history and art intertwined with passion..David Murray played the horn with heat heart muscle and bone...Poetry is not a minor art like decoupage and pique..it just seems that way...the blues cuts to the blood bone...DRn...

ghosts


if there were ghosts, they'd be hammering at our doors, all hours of the
day and night. at least half the ghosts would have reasons to seek us out,
beg us for a moment's contact, set things right again. signs of contact
would be everywhere, and the world would be in the throes of constant mur-
muring. it would not be so perfect on the other side as to lead to aband-
onment.

that atmosphere itself would be filled with shimmers for all to see. oh
mother you would answer my tears. sickness would be accompanied by slight
touches, the slightest, so welcoming and comforting. you would know you
would live long after. there would be but the slightest of smiles behind
every frown.

those who were ill-disposed towards others would be visited by wrathful
ghosts. we should not be so ill-disposed. they would interfere with us in
all our daily lives. exhortations would come from all sides. our bewild-
erment would be at the bequest of others. we would turn to ghosts. we
would be so careful because there would always be ghosts around. ghosts
could not hid, there would be so many. we would turn towards kindly
ghosts.

we would see those ghosts. we would hear those ghosts. ghosts of men and
women, ghosts of plants and animals and children, ghosts of bacteria and
of all the kingdoms of organisms on this and every other place in our
universe. we would see and hear and touch and smell those ghosts of all
creatures and all worlds; we would sense their heat and our minds would
welcome them and fear them.

think of the ghosts of half-formed seas, ghosts of algal mats, ill-formed
ghosts, ghosts of our ancestors generation upon generation. think of our
imminent ghosts, ghosts of our mothers and fathers, friends and siblings,
murmuring, leaving traces, populating the air, waves of ghosts, hordes of
ghosts. think of ghosts interpenetrating ghosts, the flowing of ghosts
through walls and doors, ceilings and floors; we would turn kindly towards
kindly ghosts, and fearful towards wrathful ghosts, and who among us would
know the consequences of all our actions and thoughts in these our lives?

if there were ghosts, they would be calling for us, and all of us would
respond, would yearn for that freedom from daily care, worries, sickness,
and deaths, that haunt us so.

fictions of the flowing of ghosts, poems of their translucency.

In the sixties I worked as Michael's assistant when he taught writing to
students at Calif. College of Arts & Crafts. We both lived near each other
in the Haight-Ashbury, and devised ways to engage the students' creativity.
The deck idea is one I've used for a couple of decades since, difficult to
explain quickly. Here goes: If one wrote down 100 words of sufficient
'charge' to oneself, put two on each card opposite each other (best to put
the ones related on a card, so they will not occur together in the games),
lines might be created by shuffling and predetermining a certain number of
words per line; these 'lines' in turn could be read,input to oneself,
followed by automatic writing. What happens in practice is that people reach
a deep personal substrate and write with more energy/candor than months of a
Creative Writing workshop might release. Hope this helps!

I may be wrong, but I do think that on the day Romanticism hit the track, it
swallowed everything.  Is there anything around we can consider classical in
the
old sense of the word:  rational, representational, etc.  Romanticism, on the
other hand, covers a lot of ground.  It seems to me that all experimentation
that violates standard narrative structures rides a Romantic impulse.  The
irrational and/or aberration has always been linked to Romanticism.  I don't
think a work must address every romantic strategy, such as the lyric and
focus on the self, to be considered romantic.  Eliot's claim of impersonality
and
use of personae don't change the fact that his poetry is Romantic.  I guess
I'm agreeing that we can't escape it.

Hi all,

Standard asked me to post his new e-mail address to the list:

sschaefer@socal.rr.com

His own address book was partially erased last month, he tells me, and he is
having some problem reestablishing his contact list, so if you've
corresponded w/ him in the past, but you are no longer certain that he has yr
e-mail address, he'd very much appreciate yr sending it on to him.

Best,
Jacques

agree with Maria D. re the alleged documentary on "the Beats" (all three
of them) & felt it did even the Big Three ostensible subjects a
disservice--more like a facile, televised kiddie-encyclopedia entry with
three scenery-chewers impersonating the subjects with jaw-dropping
awfulness. Gary Snyder--arguably a San Fran Ren guy as much as a Beat--
was important to the show only inasmuch as he knew Kerouac. For me the
high point of the entire thing was Jerry Garcia. Prescription: thirty
blows with Philip Whalen-roshi's zenslapstick.

I saw "The Source" in the Film Forum in NYC, and generally agree with your
characterization.  A very sentimental portrait, but not without interest.  A
high point for me was Corso's complaining that he wasn't mentioned on
Jeopardy.

Maria and Burt, allow me to add the following to your sensible remarks.  The
Academy has often been criticized as too theoretical.  Obviously, outside its
"walls" (on which side is the prison?) theories also abound--in particular,
the conspiracy kind.  I'm always rather astonished at the bigotry.  We know
that only a very few academics have the power to make reputations, on the
page, at conference, whatever.  Most academics teach and write and struggle,
like their nonacademic counterparts, for some small recognition.  Yes, there
are perks that go with the job.  But it is a job, however much coveted.  And
yes, most academics probably have never heard of most alternative writers.
Why?  Because they're alternative, which means, among other things, not well
known.  Charles Bernstein, whose work I enjoy, is no longer an alternative
writer in every sense.  He is no longer marginalized.  And after winning the
Tanning Prize ($100,000), MacLow can hardly be considered an outlaw.  If
these guys aren't mainstream by now, they're pretty darn close.    In
opposition to myself, I might add that since most published poetry (at least
in the big shot journals and mags) is of the standard narrative variety,
Bernstein and MacLow are still not the norm, and probably never will be.

SPIRIT OF MUSIC
International Music Festival at Yerba Buena Gardens
June 19 - 23 & June 26 - 30, 12:30 pm

For two weeks Yerba Buena Gardens will host a wide variety of international
music groups for free noon-time concerts. Last year's festival was so
successful that SPIRIT OF MUSIC
expanded to two weeks celebrating the beginning of summer with music from
around the world, food and
drinks. On June 27 the German jazz trio LINGO 3, touring the Jazz festivals
of North America, will stop
at Yerba Buena Gardens presenting Stefan Bauer's latest pieces. Featuring
Claudio Puntin, clarinet,
Marcio Doctor, percussion, and Stefan Bauer, vibraphone.

Stefan Bauer, who has been writing for Jazz and other related ensembles
since 1978, acquired a reputation as
instrumentalist and composer of a wide range of music from the conventional
to the avant-garde. Although he
has become a resident of Canada he continues to be an important part of the
European music scene which he
considers his foundation. Also his latest project, Lingo 3, with Claudio
Puntin and Marcio Doctor, has its roots
in Germany. Influenced by musicians which he encountered while touring
Africa and India, Bauer developed into a
"melody-percussionist" creating a unique mixture of elementary sounds and
new music combined with strong rhythmic
elements. Bauer's archaic sounds create a striking contrast to the
megalomenia of this millennium.

And don't miss the music from France, Sweden, the Philippines, India, Japan
and many other countries.

while agreeing with Maria (who I look forward to seeing at a conference
soon) I, of course, want to add a note regarding academic class and the
division of labors lost --  Maria notes that after a certain number of
years she is at least, once in a great while, offered a modest honorarium
which might partially defray her costs when attending conferences at which
she speaks -- 80% of all humanities professors labor at colleges and
universities outside the gravitational field of the "Research 1"
universities -- which means that 80% of hard-working scholar/teachers are
extremely unlikely ever to be offered such honoraria, or, for that matter,
to be invited speakers (as oposed to answering a general call for papers)
-- When was the last time you saw a keynoter from, say, Georgia State -- or
from any of the HBUCs? --  and one of the more galling experiences at any
conference is hearing Research 1 people refer in conversation to "those
teaching" colleges at which "research isn't emphasized"  (check that with
anybody who's gone up for tenure in the past five years!)

Having said that, I rush to add that conferences are even more valuable for
those among that 80% -- In my own case, many of my publishing projects grew
directly out of conference activities -- and the few speaking invitations I
received during my years at San Jose State were all received from people
I'd met at conferences or through my writing life -- people free from what
I sometimes call the "UC SYNDROME" (when You can't See the Cal State person
standing in front of you) -- people, quite a few of them, who populate this
list --

It is a simple fact that I could not have done much of the work that I have
done without the sustenance that conferences can provide -- I had to go
into debt to attend most of them (though things, happily, are better in my
old age), but that wasn't so bad, since I got my grad. school tuition free
for working at my university full-time (thanks again GWU!) --

If you're a doctor, you can get your way paid to a conference in Hawaii by
a drug company -- I think choosing to become a professor of literature
entails recognizing what it will cost you -- but it shouldn't cost us the
right to complain about it, should it?

I won't be back to my email for about a week -- so will lose the thread of
the great conference debate for a bit -- But despite all the complaints
about this list, about conferences, about talk of conferences on this list
. . . My life has been greatly enriched by meeting other writers and
scholars here and at conferences -- Without these (expensive)
opportunities, I'd still be out there thinking I was alone in my mania ----

Transcribimos el texto de Le=F3n Ferrari que prepar=F3 en respuesta a las p=

"Infiernos e Idolatr=EDas" es una muestra contra la tortura, humana o divin=

La =FAltima edici=F3n del Catecismo oficial de la Iglesia afirma que "las a=
lmas que mueren en estado de pecado mortal descienden a los infiernos inmed=
iatamente despu=E9s de la muerte y all=ED sufren las penas del infierno, 'e=
l fuego eterno'". Si el Papa es infalible, quienes no elegimos a Jesucristo=
  compartiremos con nuestras almas luego de la muerte "el fuego que nunca

En la exposici=F3n "Infiernos e Idolatr=EDas", que presento en el ICI Centr=
o Cultural de Espa=F1a, Florida 943, del 9/5 al 2/6/00, muestro una serie d=

Humanos que hasta el Vaticano dice respetar.

En una sala de aquel Centro Cultural dispuse unas 30 reproducciones de infi=
ernos famosos (Giotto, Fra Angelico, Dore, Boticelli) que muestran algunos =
padeceres anunciados por la Iglesia y en otra, obras que repiten o remedan =
esas ilustraciones del pensamiento evang=E9lico pero donde, en lugar de tor=
turar en ellas a nuestros semejantes supuestos pecadores, someto a diversos=

Es alentador que haya creyentes que protestan contra el infierno, aunque li=

Hello,
I am looking for any and all possible help or leads to help my brother's
not-for-profit team --the metro-west basketball team get housed in NYC. They
have a basketball tournament in the Bronx from ( i think) June15th to the
17th and their housing fell through. They can offer up $100.00. They would
only be sleeping there since the schedule is quite rigorous and they would
have to be in the Bronx for both days. They have sleeping bags and are
willing to sleep anywhere! If you could help or know of any space, a loft
etc. ... it would be greatly appreciated. They are sweet boys aging from
14-17 from Boston. I know this is a strange request and I thank you for
reading this.
Best,
Prageeta Sharma

"I may be wrong, but I do think that on the day Romanticism hit the track, it
swallowed everything.  Is there anything around we can consider classical in
the
old sense of the word:  rational, representational, etc.  Romanticism, on the
other hand, covers a lot of ground.  It seems to me that all experimentation
that violates standard narrative structures rides a Romantic impulse.  The
irrational and/or aberration has always been linked to Romanticism.  I don't
think a work must address every romantic strategy, such as the lyric and
focus on the self, to be considered romantic.  Eliot's claim of impersonality
and
use of personae don't change the fact that his poetry is Romantic.  I guess
I'm agreeing that we can't escape it."

It's interesting that the three great revolutions in European life happened
at around the same time: the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution,
and Romanticism. Of course Romanticism, like bottled Scotch Whisky, is a
product of the Industrial Revolution. (Check the label on your Scotch: it
will say that the business was founded some time between 1800 and 1840,
when the Industrial Revolution made the big stills and assembly line
bottling plants workable.) The same for tartan/plaid - the Scottish clan
tartans were revived (and in most cases invented) to find a market for the
cloth churned out by the mile on the weaving machines of Manchester circa 1830.

And of course Modernism is a transformation of Romanticism, and
Post-Modernism is a transformation of Modernism, and . . .

See, James, Pittsburgh is a moral place.  New York?
At least I see that you are not thoroughly depraved.

I've always thought that the time limit was a sensible idea - prevents the more
verbose amongst poets from hogging the limelight (hence the comments down
below). I think -always- having a time-limit may be a bad thing. Maybe it would
be interesting to have other rules - have one round with a specific form,
another with a specific subject, another with improvisation etc. Has anyone else
done this? (Maybe this is getting a bit tooo serious for a slam :-)

If you get to run more than one slam, I think it's sensible to vary who
performs, with the poets drawn from as wide a pool as possible.

#  I have seen slams run in more than a few different cities, and I've always
#  remained fondest of the variation practiced at the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe, so
#  many of my suggestions might follow along the rules laid down there.
#
#  RANDOMLY pick five to seven judges and have them rate the poem on a scale of
#  zero to ten, knock off the high and low and add the remaining scores. That's
#  the poets score for that round. At the end of the slam the highest combined
#  score from all three rounds wins. It might also help to have a "sacrificial
#  goat," that is, someone who isn't going to be competing, but who will read a
#  first poem so the judges and the audience both have a chance to warm up.
#
#  At some point slam seemed to turn into a much more serious competition than
#  I think it was originally intended to be. When I first started going to
#  slams at the Nuyorican in the early nineties all you won if you won the slam
#  was the five dollars that you'd paid to get in. Adding large cash prizes and
#  such seems to turn the affair into something other than a mock competition.

Agreed. Large cash prizes tend to spoil the atmosphere.

#  Bob Holman, who MCeed most of the earlier slams that I went to would often
#  read a statement which later appeared in Aloud: Voices From The Nuyorican
#  Poet's Cafe. Sadly, my copy of Aloud is packed away at present, but if you
#  can find this statement by my description I recommend that you also read it
#  before your slams. I believe it began with something like "We are here today
#  because we aren't somewhere else." It encourages the audience to judge the
#  judges and also reminded us that "the best poet always loses," which was
#  somewhat gratifying to me because it meant that I walked out the the Cafe as
#  the best poet at least a couple of times.
#
#  Best of luck with your slams. Try to have fun and encourage all other

New from West House Books

Martin Corless-Smith COMPLETE TRAVELS. 96pp. Typeset by
Glenn Storhaug
at Five Seasons Press. isbn 0 9531509 3 3. L9.95

containing 2 long sequences, Worcestershire Mass & The
Garden(previously published as a pamphlet by
Spectacular Books, now o.p.), & two series of shorter
poems. Martin's work has been noticed here before
(his first book _Of Piscator_ was pub. by Univ. of
Georgia in 1997). This book's as lively as his
first - better sustained, I think, but the work as
before jumps all over the place at the same time as it
keeps its lifeline to real song -

All day I lay now in a reverie
the smell of dank and humid grass
try(tried) to climb out (with) terrible
A liquid man is at my elbow
(A liquid man here at my elbow now)

There were these dolls on every surface
And must I sing? What subject shall I choose
Follow a shadow still it moves apace
curious imitation thrills at you

I Why I Write Not [Now] of Love
It is enough conspicuous
Here where I lay at what I have
at home these dolls on all the surfaces

Some act of Love (and some do not)
surprised to find here in their very eye
that what they love (and some do not)
is mere reflection of another's gaze


There will be a London launch on June 27th at
SubVoicive when Martin
reads with Ken Bolton.

Well, this is not what I've heard, not at all.  Apparently it falls to
me to point out that both Bowering and Damon will be attending the
sixties conference in Orono.  Given what happened the last time these
two were together, at the cross-dressing confab in Poughkeepsie, I'm
amazed that no one else is sounding the alarm.  The ominously-named "Dun
Roamin Cabins," where they wrote their last, giddy manifestos, never
reopened, of course.  It was torched by outraged locals and today the
site is an impromptu moral shrine.

But memories are short.  For a moment I wondered whether Bromwrath might
be prevailed upon to chaperone, but that's a little like asking Mary Kay
LeTourneau to babysit.

aldon, there's no way i can contradict or object to anything you've said.
you're right.  i'm one of the privileged ones in our line of work.  don't
think i don't know it.  in my case, there's also some tokenism involved.
so few women work on this stuff, that when the REALLY famous ones can't
come, or *won't* come for free or for the small honorarium, that's, i
suspect, when i get the call.  i'm happy for the opportunity, but i'm not
naive enough to to believe it's an entirely meritocratic system.  looking
forward to orono!!! md

NASDA to study effects of space on creativity
Yomiuri Shimbun

Art will join the hard sciences as a focus of the National Space
Development Agency of Japan's planned research projects in outer
space.

Research on artistic creativity in space is to be conducted both on
the ground and on the International Space Station (ISS), which is
currently under construction in a joint effort by 16 countries,
including Japan.

NASDA expects the research to yield unique works of art because it is
believed that the way humans perceive things can change in space. The
agency also hopes that artistic activities in space could be a way to
alleviate astronauts' stress on lengthy missions aboard the space
station.

NASDA will join with experts from Japanese art universities to
discuss proposals regarding artistic activities for astronauts in
outer space and to test those plans by producing trial works of art
on the ground.

ISS is scheduled to go into operation in 2004. NASDA will start
building its JEM research laboratory in 2002 as a part of the ISS
project.

Missions planned for JEM mainly focus on engineering research and
natural science experiments in zero gravity and studying strong
radioactive rays in space. But artistic creation will now take its
place on the research roster.

Artistic endeavors in space are not unprecedented. Takao Doi made
sketches while aboard the U.S. space shuttle Columbia in November
1997. Chiaki Mukai composed a tanka poem, a traditional Japanese
verse form, during her mission on the U.S. space shuttle Discovery in
October 1998.

Kent,

The photograph you speak of can be found here:

http://www.unc.edu/~gura/ed/

Also, as the page notes, the May 22nd New Yorker contains a brief article on
this.

The photograph was auctioned off on Ebay for $24.

Night, Online in Kyoto


Shadows struggle against the dark and stormy weather. I gouge their out-
lines; I forgive them their fury. But I do not speak and I am not respon-
sible. I learn from the book "All About Shadows" that I must be wary, need
not be caring, need only read what I want to read - that the world is
better left alone, that my very life is an interference. I learn that I am
permanently broken, that bones don't suture, that flesh only heals and
reheals itself, that scars cover scars. When you say "keep together, swal-
low dirt, eat each other," I need go no farther than the soaking walls and
falling plaster. I learn this body is bound. I learn about writing through
my book "All About Binding." I learn I do not have to respond to you. I
learn I can close myself off, huddle in this leaking room, severed from
the direct blast of the weather, that your online cries are avoidable,
that I cannot save the world, that there is no longer any world to be
saved. I read in my book "All About Naming" that I need not name, that I
can live as if drowned in raging weather.

But I do not speak and I am not responsible. I learn from the book "All
About Shadows" that I must be wary, need not be caring, need only read
what I want to read - that the world is better left alone, that my very
life is an interference!

Subject:      Re: conferences
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

If my memory serves me right, the Berkeley Poetry Conference of 1965
(Olson's endless talk, Spicer's last public event, Ginsberg and most of the
rest of the New American poets from the Allen anthology in one place really
for the first -- and last -- time ever) cost $57 for all events -- slightly
more than 34.5 hours of labor at what was then the minimum wage (I had a
10-hour per week job, so it would have cost me literally a month's income to
attend). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics's inflation calculator,
that $57 would now be equal to $309.79. But if minimum wage had kept pace,
it would now be set at $8.97 (rather than the current figure which the House
is attempting to raise to the lofty sum of $6.15).

I will concede to having snuck into the sessions I got into and regret only
that I was too young/green (18 at the time) to know which sessions were the
best bets. I missed my one chance to see Spicer and Olson, not knowing who
they were.

Among the problems of conferences, above and beyond the financial, are the
usual ones of the value of all these papers being given with the
deadly/deadening constraints of time, academic formats and, with the MLA at
least, conference rooms that were intended for small departmental business
meetings at best. When I see people using conferences just as c.v. builders,
it fills me with sadness -- they've forgotten why they got excited by poetry
in the first place.

Conversely, when somebody uses the form well, it is truly a delight to see.

The enthusiasm that greets conferences tends mostly to be an index of how
starved for community we can be, especially if we are off in some locale
geographically removed from a lively, ongoing scene. That's a legitimate
use, for which we should be thankful.

This is entirely impossible. I have a reputation to uphold, as a

matches my moral and epistemological characters. Grunge, indeed. I

Subject: Ed Roberson's Atmoshpere Conditions


I just wanted to share this excellent review of Ed Roberson's
Atmosphere Conditions with our mailing list and the
Buffalo list.

Its from Kirkus Review June 15, 2000

Abscence and the puzzles of abscence are the central tropes of
Roberson's poetry: reading these poems (which won the 1998
National Poetry Series award) is somewhat like climbing stairs
in the dark: one is never certain where the turns will come, or where
the climber's tentative foot will discover only "a step of the air
dissolving." This is not quite the mode of elegy, though Roberson
is attracted by the paradoxes of memory. It is no doubt the difficult
need to craft a verse that changes while holding change intact that
drives Roberson to some of his wilder linguistic and formal experiments.
At worst, these caprices are merely self-indulgent--declining to close a
parenthesis when it is not clear why one needed to be opened in the
first place, or pedantically drawing attention to puns ("rememberings /
remember," in the piece entitled "The Osiris Addendum")--while at others
they chime truly with the thematics of his verse. This is preeminently
the case with the title poem, which leads off the collection and
establishes many of its governing concerns. Here, the chief subject is
meteorology, a storm's unpredictable turnings, its lowering anti-climxes
and, perhaps most of all, its sudden disappearance. The most striking
metaphor of the poem, typical of Roberson's oblique self-consciousness,
links the pattern of weather to a type or writing: "It burns into stone
only this name / you see. Graffiti appears only on what is disappearing
/ marking the going out." Like these poems, graffiti only asks for small
and partial triumphs, it is a sudden testament and soon demolished. This
is exactly the pitch of this poet, who states in mournful but pragmatic
tones, "I seem to know / what to do in the ashes where I come in."
      Exceedingly rich, but certainly filling.

Dear List.  I'd like to draw everyone's attention to the spring issue of TDR
featuring translations of interviews and theoretical writings of Hijikata
Tatsumi, a co-founder of Butoh dance.  These are substantial English
translations of a spiritual cousin of Artaud's.  His writing is full of
disjunctions, neologisms, and "parables" that the translations successfully
capture.  Take a look.  I've found these translations to be some of the best
reading I've encountered in a long while.  There are some fascinating
illustrations as well.  The rest of the magazine is given over to
discussions of modern Japanese theater and two interesting articles on Uncle
Tom in the theater and movies.  All best, Jesse Glass

Greetings Poetry Fans,

Currently, there is a discussion underway on ChaptersGLOBE.com with poet
host Adeena Karasick.

Adeena Karasick is a poet / cultural theorist and performance artist; and
the author of four books of poetry and poetic theory.

She is here to discuss her latest work, Dyssemia Sleeze.

Here is an excerpt from her discussion:
"Some of the issues that particularly interest me right now are the notion
of how one constructs poetry out of "borrowed" words; words of different
histories, contexts, textures and swing through some paratactic axes of
micro-syntactical anxiety, and end up forming their own world, a place of
ecstasis and terror, exuberance, beauty and anguish and necessarily question
the function of meaning production. i am particularly interested in the
intersection between different modes of discourse -- juxtaposing the
theoretic or latinate with the vulgar, the downtrodden and all that is
unrecognizable. i am excited by the idea of exploring notions of performance
and the written text. Issues of gender and identity, ethnicity and how that
gets played out through the writing praxis."

As the Nader campaign keeps rolling on, words of wisdom in Texas drawl =
from
Jim Hightower.

The Hightower Lowdown Copyright 2000 Public Intelligence Inc.

Here=EDs a democrat for President! Nader=EDs slugging it out with the =
party
duopoly
by Jim Hightower

As most of us know by now, the Republicrat two-party duopoly is squeezing
the life out of our democratic system. The majority no longer has a
political home, and the choices are so dismal that there are more people =
in
America today who bowl than vote in presidential elections.

Both national parties now exist as wholly-owned subsidiaries of corporate
America, selling two brands of the same corporate agenda: Bud =
Light=F3Miller
Lite/George Bush=F3Al Gore, take your choice. Mighty small beer. But wait, =

this is America! We don=EDt have to take what the Powers That Be give to =
us.
We can create a new politics, just as others before us have had to do: the =

revolutionaries of 1776, the abolitionists, the suffragists, the =
populists,
the A.F.L, the Wobblies, the C.I.O., the civil rights movement, the =
antiwar
protesters . . . and, today, the democracy agitators who are in rebellion
against global corporate rule.

In every case, ordinary citizens have had to do the extraordinary, going
right into the face of entrenched political and economic power, clobbering =

the system, getting clobbered in return, yet persevering, pushing . . . =
and
eventually widening the possibilities of democratic participation. And, in =

every case, these democratizing movements have had to create their own
political channels. Now comes Ralph Nader=F1he=EDs serious, he=EDs ready, =
he=EDs
running. Forging a blue=F3green, labor=F3environmental alliance and
articulating  (as only he can do) a powerful, unifying message of citizen
democracy over  global corporate plutocracy, he=EDs offering himself and =
his
Green Party  presidential candidacy as an organizing tool for building a
new political  channel around the corporate-controlled two-party duopoly
that=EDs blocking  America=EDs majority from democratic participation in =
power.

Unlike 1992, when he merely allowed his name to be on the ballot, and 1996 =

when he chose not to fund-raise or campaign aggressively, Nader is going
all  out in 2000: He=EDs working on the campaign full time; he=EDs =
traversing
America, going to all 50 states, launching petition drives that will put
him  on the ballot in at least 40 states; he=EDs raising at least $5 =
million
to  finance his grassroots organization; he has assembled a top-notch =
staff
(headed by longtime citizen activist Theresa Amato of Chicago) that
includes  experienced people to handle everything from fund-raising and
field  organizing to press and the website (www.votenader.com); and he has
enlisted  the respected campaign veteran Steve Cobble to serve as =
political
strategist. With Native-American activist Winona LaDuke as his running
mate,  Ralph not only is committed to providing a real choice in November
and  building a Green Party infrastructure, but he also seems to be
enjoying it!  I think Nader is the right person, running for the right
reasons, at the  right time.

The right person

Americans are yearning for a simple quality that=EDs rare in politics =
these
days: Integrity. This was the core appeal of Sen. John McCain, whose
candidacy even attracted liberals willing to overlook his right-wing =
record
because he "had integrity." Susan DeMarco and I hear this yearning daily =
in
our conversations with callers on our "Chat & Chew" radio talk show
(www.jimhightower.com, M=F3F, noon=F32 EST) where a common refrain is the
desire  for candidates who are not bought by anyone, who stand squarely on
basic  principles of fairness and justice for all, and who are unafraid to
fight  the corporate and governmental elites running roughshod over us.

Who today really fits this standard? Ralph Nader. He needs no gaggle of
spin  meisters, no policy puffers to concoct a record of integrity for him
as Gore  and Bush must have=F1he is integrity. In a time when the phrase
"shallow  politics" has become a redundancy, Nader=EDs reform agenda of =
civic
democracy  is not a political position=F1it=EDs his life!

For 35 years, he has sustained one of the most effective citizen=EDs
movements  in our history. For example, thanks to his initiatives, cars
have seat  belts, water is cleaner, children=EDs pajamas don=EDt burst =
into
flame, there=EDs  no smoking on airlines, there are right-to-know laws =
about
polluting  factories, and our air is less toxic=F1the guy has saved more
lives than  Mother Teresa. Among other fights, he=EDs been on the front =
lines
against  abusive HMOs, the autocratic Federal Reserve, NAFTA and the WTO,
corporate  crime, union busters, Pentagon follies, and the corruption of
our government  by big money.

When George W. Bush was wasting his twenties and thirties as a party
animal,  when Al Gore Jr. was carefully plotting his climb up the ladder =
of
corporate-financed politics, when Pat Buchanan was a Nixon hatchet man,
Ralph Nader was with the folks, battling for both political and economic
democracy. Ralph has done more for people as a private citizen than Bush,
Gore, Bradley, McCain, and all the other presidential contenders combined
have done from their positions of governmental power. Nader has the
credibility, the conscientiousness, the cojones, and, yes, even the
celebrity to make a serious run.

The right reasons

Ralph doesn=EDt need this. His legacy is well-earned and secure (unlike =
Bill
Clinton who=EDs still rattling around the White House mumbling, "Where=EDs =
my
legacy?"). Yet, he=EDs out there right now, going from state to state,
neighborhood to neighborhood in an earnest, energetic run for the
presidency. Why? "I have a personal distaste for the trappings of modern
politics," he says, "but I can no longer stomach the systemic political
decay that has weakened our democracy. . . . It is necessary to launch a
sustained effort to wrest control of our democracy from the corporate
government and restore it to the political government under the control of =

citizens."

Ralph=EDs "deep democracy campaign," as he calls it, serves as a rallying =
cry
to get all of us running. He asks, "Why are campaigns just for =
candidates?"
The campaign itself has to belong to you and me=F1we have to do the heavy
lifting along with him, using his candidacy as leverage for building a =
new,
national, populist party with an organized grassroots base.

His commitment is to the long haul of party building. Hence, his campaign
appearances are with local activists, highlighting the work of those who
are  already engaged in challenging corporate power where they live; money
he  raises locally stays with the local campaign; not a dime of the $5
million  he=EDs raising nationally is going for pollsters, consultants, or
media  hype=F1rather, it=EDs going into grassroots organizing; as he runs, =
he=EDs
supporting Greens and other progressives who=EDre running for state and =
local
offices; in addition to fund-raisers, he=EDs holding time-raisers, asking
people to contribute a specific amount of volunteer time, which translates =

into millions of dollars worth of work that GoreBush have to spend their
corporate loot to get; and the lists of supporters and donors generated by =

all of these efforts are provided to local campaigns for future =
organizing.

The strategy here is straightforward=F1even if Ralph doesn=EDt make it to =
the
White House this time, the campaign itself will advance the cause by
strengthening the grassroots base, electing other people to office,
developing campaign talent, and qualifying the Greens for national ballot
status. If Nader crosses the threshold of getting even 5% of the November
vote, this will entitle the Green Party to some $13 million in F.E.C.
funding for party-building work in the future. As strategist Steve Cobble
puts it, "This is the baseline for a real party, and we=EDre already =
beyond
that" (see box above).

Ralph is running not only to force the issues of America=EDs populist
majority  (see last month=EDs Lowdown) into this year=EDs presidential =
debate,
but also to  make the progressive movement stronger on November 8th=F1the =
day
after the  election. The right time What if Ralph actually won? I know
you=EDll think  I=EDve been smoking loco weed even to suggest such a =
thing, and
Nader himself  sure isn=EDt wasting any time on Oval Office daydreams, but
don=EDt rule out the  possibility that he will at least do much better =
than
the cognescenti now  imagines. Why?


He=EDs already doing better. Before anyone knows he=EDs actually running,
before  they=EDve heard him turn on a crowd and rip apart the milque toast
candidates  of the status quo, April=EDs Zogby Poll finds Ralph to be the =
big
surprise,  running at nearly 6% nationwide, ahead of Buchanan=EDs 3.6%, =
and
running even  stronger among young people, Independents, the poor and
working class,  African-Americans, small-city dwellers, and people in the
west. The poll  understates Nader=EDs strength, since it tallies only =
people
already planning  to vote. Nader will appeal to disaffected non-voters who
will be lured back  to the voting booth when they learn he=EDs on the =
ballot.
People really are fed up. As the months wear on, GoreBush will only
intensify the disgust and embarrassment people already feel about either =
of
these two corrupted weaklings sitting in America=EDs big chair. They want
integrity; they get two whores of the corporate order. They plan to tune
out, not vote . . . then they find Ralph.
Realignment. Republicans and Democrats are re-running the =ED96 campaign,
with  Bush stressing tax cuts and laissez-faire government, while Gore
stresses  "prosperity" and social issues. They are running right-to-left
campaigns,  which entirely miss the real-life concerns of the majority of
people, who  are thinking top-to-bottom=F1issues like the downsizing of =
the
middle class  and the WTO/IMF/NAFTA globaloney. These issues=F1as well as
integrity=F1don=EDt  fit on the right-to-left spectrum, and by focusing on
them, Ralph will draw  many people who think of themselves as
"conservatives." The only other one  even talking to this disgruntled
majority is Pat Buchanan, and his  xenophobic, brown-shirted populism =
makes
Ralph=EDs run even more
imperative=F1progressives cannot leave this turf to Buchanan.
The Kids. The Seattle Tea Party (see The Lowdown, January 2000) and last
month=EDs citizen uprising in D.C. against the IMF and World Bank were =
driven
by the idealism and outrage of the young. Go to a campus today and =
you=EDll
find Students Against Sweatshops, Students Against Hunger and =
Homelessness,
The Dirty Job Boycott, and much more. Young folks are on the move again . =

 and Ralph is someone who can get them excited and get them involved in
electoral politics. If so, his campaign will become a crusade.
This is a four-way race. Gore, Bush, Nader, Buchanan=F126% of the vote =
could
get you there, and it damn sure could make progressive populists real
players again in national policy. Remember that Abraham Lincoln, candidate =

of the Republican Party that then was only six years old, won in 1860 in a =

four-way race, getting 39% of the vote.
Turnout. The conventional hogwash is that Ralph will only draw votes from
Gore. Aside from the fact that Gore=EDs plight is his own damn fault, =
Nader=EDs
run is not drawing from hardcore Democrats, but from independents,
mavericks, non-voters, and nonoftheabovers. He will increase the turnout =
of
progressives in November, which not only will advance his cause, but also
will add to the votes of Democrats in some close congressional =
races=F1people
who vote for Nader at the top of the ballot will find some Democrats to
support on down the line.
The debates. What if Nader gets in the debates? He=EDll eat Gore and Bush
like  they were a couple of hors d=EDoeuvres at a corporate fund-raiser, =
and
Americans will see that there really is a choice. He has top notch legal
talent at work on getting him in, and he has a citizen campaign underway =
to
call, fax and e-mail the TV networks demanding that they open the process
to  him. In addition, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. has a bill to let anyone who
scores  above 5% in the polls participate in the debates. As Jesse Ventura
showed in  Minnesota, getting a third-party candidate into the debates can
be the  difference between being a protest candidate and a victor.

Who=EDs going Green?

Of course, where there=EDs a will, there are a thousand won=EDts, and too =
many
leaders of Washington-based progressive organizations have been looking =
for
reasons to be Nader naysayers, even to snicker at Ralph=EDs run. Some =
don=EDt
think the Greens are the "right" party=F1too many kooks.

Please. Have you been to a Democratic or Republican party convention? Have =

you seen Congress? Jesse Helms is sane? Bob Barr=EDs not a kook? The =
Greens
are a maturing party, and Ralph=EDs broad-based, blue=F3green agenda is =
not
only  welcome there, but will refine and extend the party=EDs message.

Ralph and the Greens will work with all progressive parties=F1the Labor
Party,  insurgent Democrats, the New Party, progressive Reform Party
chapters, etc.  Supporting Nader doesn=EDt mean you=EDre wedded to the =
Green
Party, and it  doesn=EDt preclude anyone from working at the same time =
inside
other parties.  We can debate the "right" party forever, but finally
someone has to do  something. Ralph has. I say, let=EDs join him. I=EDll =
be
giving him a helping  hand, as will such others as Barbara Ehrenreich,
Michael Moore, Bonnie  Raitt, Jackson Browne, Ani Di Franco, and Willie
Nelson. This is bigger than  a party . . . bigger than Ralph. It=EDs us
seizing our own political and  economic destiny, building a politics =
we=EDre
for, rather than settling for  the evil of the two lessers (as Dave
Dellinger used to call it). Why not act  on our ideals and democratic
values? It=EDs a politics that=EDs worthy of you,  and ultimately, it=EDs =
the
only way to win.

Besides, it=EDs fun! Ralph is looser, funnier, sharper than I=EDve ever =
seen

But
with Ralph Nader out there, it is easy.

Hey, what's wrong with being depraved?!!?  Pitt a moral place?  I hope it's
not that boring.  I have relatives there, and they seem pretty bored.  Well,
it's hard to see outward to the farthest reaches--like Pitt--from the center
of the universe (NYC!).

The conferees for various parties of hope struggle with forms and talk loudly in
the interstices. Intellectual labors are subsumed in the void of dreamworlds.
Susan Buck-Morss in her recent _Dreamworld and Catastrophe: The Passing of Mass
Utopia in East and West_  (MIT Press 2000) argues that a collective dreaming has
disintegrated. Post- 1989, etc.

To conference is to parlay the hopes of caucusing. That the margin of privilege
can be coterminous with the margin. That the jostling and touching and communism
of folk-individuals makes us believe in shared hermeneutics of suspicion and
other hysterias of being together, like, poetry. A multi-cameral legislature
that isn't a target market.

So what is the intellectuals being together now? A therapy for individuated
assuagement and nostalgia capture?

Virtuals posited and few rouleau for honoraria: got to have a con in the land of
milk and honey.

A poetry of post-scarcity, or the parole of permanent critique.

I am going to conference.

Time Limits. Yes, it was draconian of me to insist these be strictly
enforced with spoon and glass. After all, what I really had in mind was
boiling oil and redhot tongs. I wont bore you here today with my sufferings
over the decades at the hands (voices) of (un)certain poetasters, going on
and on about their first transcendendant experience in India in 1969 or
what the babysitter did to them or or or or.....Suffice it to remark that,
when you, David Cameron, reach your sixties, and given that you have been
as faithful an attendee at readings as I have, I warrant you will have
shifted your position until it aligns with mine. I shall be dead by then
(possibly from terminal boredom at a monster poetry reading), and I hope
you will shed a bitter tear or two at the memory of your having
contradicted my advice in front of all these people, some of them dear
friends and esteemed colleagues...like X, for instance, whom I first met at
Berkeley in 1962 : there he was, seated in the first graduate seminar I
myself took then, it was a hot, muggy, cold day in early spring and fall,
and......
and........and.........

Flesh and blood can bear no more. How can people so singularly ungifted for
verse have so poor a grasp of mundane time-units?

However, here's an even better suggestion : deduct ten points for every
minute a reader runs overtime. Less broken glass around, and no need for
embarrassing hooks. If reader uses up all points and enters negative point
zone, why _then_ s/he can be given to the audience to be rent limb from
limb.

> Academics and Industry Issue Pact to Guide the Evolution of Scholarly
> Publishing
> By DENISE K. MAGNER
>
> The world of scholarly publishing -- shaken by sharp increases in
> both the cost and the sheer volume of academic journals -- cannot be
> sustained, according to an agreement released today by a group of
> campus administrators, publishers, librarians, and association
> leaders. Joining forces, they have crafted a set of nine principles
> to "guide the transformation of the scholarly publishing system."
>
> The unprecedented agreement, coordinated by the Association of
> American Universities and the Association of Research Libraries,
> calls for changes in the relationships among publishers,
> universities, disciplinary societies, and faculty members.
>
> The agreement, "Principles for Emerging Systems of Scholarly
> Publishing," recommends that the various players, working
> independently or together, seek to accomplish the following:
>
> * Reduce the emphasis on the quantity of publications in
> evaluating a professor's work.
> * Speed up the process from submission of an article to its publication.
> * Collaborate on new publishing ventures to create alternatives
> to high-cost journals.
> * Find new approaches to peer review of articles in an electronic age.
> * Develop common coding standards to assure wide access to
> scholarship on the Web.
>
> "The current system of scholarly publishing has become too costly for
> the academic community to sustain," according to an introduction to
> the nine principles. "Numerous studies, conferences, and roundtable
> discussions over the past decade have analyzed the underlying causes
> and recommended solutions to the scholarly publishing crisis. Many
> new publishing models have emerged. A lack of consensus and concerted
> action by the academic community, however, continues to allow the
> escalation of prices and volume."
>
> For the first time, said John C. Vaughn, executive vice president of
> the Association of American Universities, representatives of the
> various participants in academic publishing "have agreed on a set of
> characteristics that ought to define the scholarly publishing
> system." His organization is urging presidents of its member
> institutions to create special forums on their campuses to discuss
> the crisis. "If we can get a broad buy-in to these characteristics,"
> he said, "then we've got a template to use to try to fix a broken
> system."
>
> The problems in scholarly publishing are well-known: the choked
> library budgets as journal prices in science, technology, and medical
> fields have skyrocketed; the proliferation in the actual number of
> journals published; and the "death" of the scholarly monograph in the
> humanities, as libraries have had less money to purchase books and
> young scholars have reported increased difficulties getting their
> first books published.
>
> "Cost is the whole issue," said Daryle H. Busch, president of the
> American Chemical Society and a professor of chemistry at the
> University of Kansas who was among the 36 signatories. "Some journals
> cost more than others, and there are more journals than there used to
> be. Every faculty member gets a list of journals that are going to be
> discontinued at their campus library -- this happens once or twice a
> year on every campus."
>
> The nine principles were first debated last spring at an
> invitation-only meeting in Tempe, Ariz. In the months that followed,
> the document was further refined via e-mail. The plan is for
> participants to circulate the principles -- both the A.A.U. and the
> research-library group plan to send copies of the document to member
> institutions -- with the goal of reaching a broader consensus across
> academe about how to proceed. The two organizations also plan to
> assemble a national committee in the next few months to monitor the
> debate and try to move it forward.
>
> But even within the circle of 36 signatories, however, consensus was
> not easily reached, said Duane Webster, executive director of the
> Association of Research Libraries. "Academic institutions were
> concerned about costs. Librarians were promoting access. The presses
> were concerned with assuring their contributors an effective presence
> in the marketplace," he said. "Where we got agreement was the sense
> that we have to work together to shape the future."
>
> A handful of large commercial publishers get the most blame for the
> escalating journal prices, but those companies were intentionally not
> invited to the discussions. "We thought it was important to specify
> what the academic community wanted," said David E. Shulenburger,

>
> He and other signatories say they are trying to wake up faculty
> members who haven't paid much attention to the crisis in publishing.
> "The real call is for faculty to understand what is going on in the
> marketplace, what is going on in technology, and to be a part of the
> debate," said Mr. Webster, of the research-library group. "And right
> now, they're not."
>
> One of the more controversial recommendations calls on professors to
> "refrain from submitting their work and assigning copyright to
> expensive journals when high quality inexpensive publication outlets
> are available." The framers of the principles know that is asking a
> lot. "If you're an assistant professor up for tenure and the most
> prestigious journal is a commercial journal, then that's where you
> have to publish," lacking an alternative, said the A.A.U.'s Mr.
> Vaughn.
>
> That's why the agreement urges faculty members, universities, and

>
> "The control of academic output cannot be in the hands of a few
> commercial publishers who are seeking to exploit a narrow and

>
> The agreement also calls on institutions and faculty members to

After the reading we'll probably head to La Tazza at 108 Chestnut where Jon
Stark "the Scottish photographer" and sometime poetry fan is having a photo
show and party. Meet you there.

WHO ARE THEY?

ETHAN FUGATE is one of the New Wave of DC Surrealists. They're strength is
growing in the nation's hotbed of political shenanigans, and soon they will
take over. Remember when Ginsberg thought the nation's water supply should be
supplemented with a certain hallucinogenic? Well, Ethan's poetry is the
written equivalent.

CATHLEEN MILLER has recently completed her MA at Temple University. Now she's
ready for the big bad world of real life. Can her poetry buoy her up? Come and
find out!

*************************************************************************

WHAT HAPPENED LAST READING?

As Rebecca Wolff and I rode into Philadelphia on the R7 SEPTA train from
Trenton we passed a warehouse engulfed in flames in the Northeast. I turned
to Rebecca and said, "Welcome to Philadelphia!" She was properly frightened
and excited.

The reading was sparsely attended in terms of number of people due to the
stormy weather. But in terms of quality of audience it was great. Our core
faithful audience was there, those who have made hosting the readings truly
rewarding. A big shout-out of love and thanks to you. You know who you are.

Rebecca Wolff read ironic, dark, and funny work. Kyle Conner told me he was
really, really into her work as we walked to Anthony's Pub later that night.

Mark Gaertner read funny poems that were totally about other things than I
had thought while I read them privately. For example, one poem was about
some new missile technology and I thought it was about coming to terms with
male identity. It always cracks me up when the author's intentions are
different than what the reader imagined.

Later that night we clowned it up at Anthony's as always.

Actually, the crack was meant for Sherry, not you.  But if you can't see the
depravity in Weber and company's behavior then you may be a New Yorker but

Ron, judging from my reg card for the conference, scanned in here:

http://www.thepomegranate.com/loden/

it looks like there were two tiers, $25 and $45.  I paid $45, which
(apparently) was the max.

Well, isn't that special.  I note that Adeena Karasick has already
snapped up _Dyssemia Sleeze_, the title I'd been saving for my next
opus.  And I might add that whenever I swing through some paratactic
axis of micro-syntactical anxiety, I always try to swing through the
paratactic axis of micro-syntactical anxiety that I haven't swung
through before.  And so, adieu!

Call it "Motel Imperial"
Or "Hostel Empirical"

All I can say from the vantage point of the Runaway Spoon Press, which
is many miles further from the Pitt Press so far as commerciality goes
than the Pitt Press is from Random House, is fie on both houses.  Who
cares what happens to some for-salaries-not-profits company in its
quarrel over money with a for-profits-only company regarding the book
of some say-it-old, easy-witted new version of Rod McKuen?

For the record: in the unlikely event that any bottom-line publisher,
including the Pitt Press, wanted to republish one of the Runaway Spoon
Press's titles, or selected poems from it, all they would need would be
the author's permission.  They wouldn't even have to let me know or
acknowledge where the material first appeared, although I would hope
they would.

Having found my list of monosyllabic words, I am now
looking for a list of compound words formed from
monosyllabics.  Any resources anyone might care to
point their way to would be appreciated.
I'd also be interested to read other poems written in
monosyllabics. Some of Creeley and Hopkins has been
useful, but I'd be interested to know if any poets
have successfully specialised in it.
Thanx.

Dear List.  I'd like to draw everyone's attention to the spring
issue of TDR
featuring translations of interviews and theoretical writings
of Hijikata
Tatsumi, a co-founder of Butoh dance.  These are substantial
English
translations of a spiritual cousin of Artaud's.  His writing
is full of
disjunctions, neologisms, and "parables" that the translations
successfully
capture.  Take a look.  I've found these translations to be some
of the best
reading I've encountered in a long while.  There are some fascinating
illustrations as well.  The rest of the magazine is given over
to
discussions of modern Japanese theater and two interesting articles
on Uncle
Tom in the theater and movies.  All best, Jesse Glass

        Thanks for the info re the new Emily photo--

        This is not a new photo but an old portrait of interest:  Emily as
a child with her brother Austin and sister Lavina.
        You can find it and a lot of other Dicksinson family images at

        Virtual Emily

Paradigm Press is pleased to announce four new titles....


Baker, Lori
On the Verge
0-945926-63-4 $5
32 pages
paperback, saddlestitched
fiction

This light romp through the Cornish village of Seaspittle, population
25, introduces us to the lovelorn yet fiercely independent Harriet
Falcon and her trusty Scottish terrier, Robert Henryson. They search
for the ever-elusive Viking along the sheep-pocked dramatic cliffs,
within the cozy confines of the local pub, or while lost among the
dusty museum cases of local history and curious doodads, joined in
their quest by a gentle soul from Canada, who seeks diversion through
witty conversation.
Harriet's quest is always on the verge of success, and yet  This
joyful story is by the author of Crazy Water (winner of the Bobst
Prize for Fiction from NYU Press), Scraps and Minor Archeologies.


Hawkes, John
Regulus & Maximus
0-945926-59-6 $7
20 pages
paperback, saddlestitched
fiction


John Hawkes, master of the contorted narrative of propulsive energy,
left behind this mesmerizing fragment, which first appeared in
Conjunctions 10. Herein, two packs of runaway monks leave behind the
safety of their monasteries for the ecstatic uncertainty in seeking
something pure, hard and beautiful. While one group runs from the
excesses of extraordinary gluttony, the other is in heated retreat
from severe privation. Both groups seek refuge by abandoning
themselves to the state of pure motion.
This breathless fragment is vintage John Hawkes, famed author of The
Cannibal, The Passion Artist, The Frog and Innocence in Extremis. His
passion for language, and for exposing the heightened state of the
human condition, is in pure form here.



Moriarty, Laura
Duse
0-945926-62-6 $5
32 pages
paperback, saddlestitched
poetry

This publication brings back into print Laura Moriarty's beautifully
spare and precise poetry-sequence that focuses on the great dramatic
actor, Eleanora Duse. The ephemeral becomes tangible within this poem,
with projected memory becoming the basis of a hoped-for future:
"things cherished a whole / civilization artificially would / have."
The text becomes a reflection upon its opening line: "Loss as rest
from meaning." The intersection of the solid with the transitory, the
real with the artificial, leads the reader into a world of
uncertainty, of mimetic gestures coming ever closer to the core
experience, ever searching for emotional truth.
Duse was originally published by David I. Sheidlower's Coincidence
Press. Laura Moriarty is also author of Like Roads, Cunning, Spicer's
City and Rondeaux.


Nelson, Gale
Art by Lori Baker
Intersecting Mr. Sams
0-945926-60-X $5
28 pages
paperback, saddlestitched
prose

The narrator of these little prose pieces has a series of minor
adventures during which, in each case, there is an intersection with
the splendid cat, Mr. Sams. Whether visiting the seashore, eating
parts of speech or learning the meaning of photosynthesis, the
narrator relies on the good judgment and excellent taste of Mr. Sams.
The splendid line drawings by Lori Baker help to give the texts the
light feel of a literary children's book. This book is not for the
serious-minded, but rather for those who take pleasure from the
goings-on of Pierre Albert-Birot's Grabinoular.
Gale Nelson is also author of ceteris paribus and stare decisis. This
is Lori Baker's first artwork publication.

INNOVATIVE  WEEKLY SERIALIZED CYBER- NOVEL, "MAN IN HER MIND,"
BY MARALYN LOIS POLAK,  DEBUTS  ON WWW.FEMMESOUL.COM


Internet essayist, radio personality, and spoken word artist Maralyn Lois
Polak's experimental, interactive  cyber-novel, ''THE MAN IN HER MIND:
Further Adventures of Boris and Natasha,"  has made its online debut on the
political-literary web magazine, WWW. FEMMESOUL.COM, where it is being
serialized weekly.

The author, who has reviewed books for the New York Times, and guested on
NPR's Fresh Air with  Terry Gross, currently writes a weekly commentary
column called "Left-Handed," for Joseph Farah's  acclaimed WorldNetDaily.Com,
one of the best-read news sites on the internet.

The Man in Her Mind:
Further Adventures of Boris* and Natasha*
by
Maralyn Lois Polak

In computerese, * means a kiss.

The heady romantic comedy,
 a serial cyber-novel bondage thriller ,
the story of net-soul-mates
who finally find each other,
poetry and art, whips and chains,
to say nothing of virtual happiness
through their computers
as they cast off their neuroses, and obsolete spouses,
to snorkel away into the sunset
of paradise....
NOT!!

Surf this book!!

EPIGRAPH:

"Let not that devil, which undoes your sex,
That cursed curiosity, seduce you
To hunt for needless secrets, which neglected,
Shall never hurt your quiet, but once known,
Shall sit upon your heart!"
--Rowe


"It all started with a mysterious and seemingly innocent e-mail, but from
that point nothing was to remain the same in the life of Boris, a quiet
solitary artist living in Cloudsville, USA. His logical, methodical Virgo
world was suddenly turned upside down by a strangely exotic woman living in a
tropically decorated cottage a mere hundreds of minutes away. Who is Natasha?
How can she 'see' what Boris is thinking when they have never met? Is she a
long-lost twin? And is he a clairvoyant? Or a malevolent angel? How does he
know her favorite cheese? Are we witnessing the flowering of a magical
relationship or....what?"

Time Limits. Yes, it was draconian of me to insist these be strictly
enforced with spoon and glass. After all, what I really had in mind was
boiling oil and redhot tongs. I wont bore you here today with my sufferings
over the decades at the hands (voices) of (un)certain poetasters, going on
and on about their first transcendendant experience in India in 1969 or
what the babysitter did to them or or or or.....Suffice it to remark that,
when you, David Cameron, reach your sixties, and given that you have been
as faithful an attendee at readings as I have, I warrant you will have
shifted your position until it aligns with mine. I shall be dead by then
(possibly from terminal boredom at a monster poetry reading)

How can people so singularly ungifted for
verse have so poor a grasp of mundane time-units?

Well, I'm not sixty, yet, but I also have had my fill of the self-absorbed.
Strangely, I still hang with artists.  Go figure.  Boiling oil might peel the
paint.  How about a good old fashioned gong, or drop a piano or somethin'?

Just let me point out that the Orono gropefest has been renamed "The
Opening of the Field." Ms Loden is really going to gnash her teeth
and shoulderbones when she hears reports of this one!

For Release Only

Ethan Cohen Fine Arts invites you to Camouflage Fiction, opening June 22,
from 6-8pm. This will be a one-man show of mixed media and installation. Born
in 1969 in Liaoning, China, Pan Xing Lei began his public art life as one of
the student sculptors of the Goddess of Democracy Statue erected during the
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. In recent years, he has participated in
several large international art exhibitions including: "Leased Legacy," Hong
Kong 1997 and Frankfurt 1997), Inside Out: New Chinese Art," (New York 1998,
San Francisco MOMA 1999, and still traveling internationally),and "The New
Face of Hong Kong", (Berlin, 1998.)
It is in these works that the artist offers a twenty-first century
amalgamation of media which creates a narrative connecting traditional
Chinese Art and contemporary cultural iconography such as camouflage,
paramilitary insignia, and silhouettes. In his scrolls, we see his
incorporation of the silhouette of the goddess of democracy that allows Pan
Xing Lei to cast a humorous and self-mocking reference to Tiananmen Square.
The works rest on representing a repetitious pop-cultural icon of the goddess
in order to suggest a terrible calamity and a hint of danger, passion and
violence that resonate in all of his works. Pan Xing Lei's work in the past,
has insisted on a reckoning of the British Territory's cultural ethos with
its Chinese roots, in anticipation of the upcoming handover to mainland
dominion which has now happened.
Pan Xing Lei emerged as an artistic force in Hong Kong, where his combined
use of sculpture, performance and installation work. In his first one man
show in America, we are proud to present an initial glimpse of this exciting
young artist, who's work reflects a life lived both physically and
intellectually, in a place where east and west are one, and the future
belongs to it's mix.

Subject:      Chartings: Hejinian and DiPalma
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

ANNOUNCING:
CHARTINGS

Chax Press has finished binding the edition of the fine artist's book
CHARTINGS, poem (a long poem in 20 sections) by Lyn Hejinian and Ray
DiPalma; book conception, design, printing, and construction by Charles
Alexander; hand "markings" by visual artist Cynthia Miller.

The book is oversize at 13.5 inches high by 11.25 inches wide when closed.
The paper is Tiara, and it has been printed with large (4-inch high) wood
type letters and numbers, in randomly dispersed patterns, in colors of
yellow. Onto these pages have been collaged the poems, which were
originally printed with Bembo 14-point type on handmade Japanese "Mulberry"
paper. After printing, each poem was hand torn, and is pasted into the
book. The pages of the book were hand-marked (each page of each copy
individually) with a sewing instrument called a "tracing wheel," that made
more chartings of perforation-like marks in linear and curved patterns, to
accompany the more language-based chartings of the poems and of the
background oversized letters. Because of all the hand tearing and
individual hand marking with the tracing wheel, it is impossible for any
two copies of Chartings to be exactly alike. There is a great deal of
interplay in the book's structure and visuals between notions of stasis and
flow, among other ideas.

The book was sewn in two signatures into reversible "Unryu" endsheets
(black one side, white the other, textured, with visible fibers) with a
concertina spine. Then this book structure was pasted into boards which are
covered with red Moriki paper, with the spine left visible.

Just 80 copies have been produced (each copy signed by the authors and hand
numbered), and each sells for $320. Anyone responding from the Poetics List
will receive a 20% discount and will not be charged any shipping/handling
fees. The book will be very carefully packed, insured, and shipped Priority
Mail unless otherwise requested.

If you begin a standing order to Chax Press with an order for Chartings,
you will receive the book for $200 (a discount of more than 30%), and you
will receive a 30% discount on all future books (or orders from our
backlist). The future books will automatically be sent to you with an
invoice. In general, this means two to three trade literary books per year
(retailing at $12 to $20 each, sometimes a hardcover book which retails for
$30 to $60), one or two chapbooks per year (about $12 each, mixing offset
printing and hand bookmaking work), and one fine artist's book (like
Chartings, generally ranging in price from $100 to $400) per year. Some of
our fine artist's books, which attempt to develop imaginative book forms
which collaborate with innovative texts, may only be available to standing
order patrons.

This offer does not apply to institutional orders; however, institutions
may place standing orders and receive a 30% discount.

Please email orders directly to Chax Press: chax@theriver.com
Identify yourself as responding to this message on the Poetics List.
Credit cards are acceptable. If paying by check, please send check ($256)
and order in advance (but notify us by email that it is coming and we will
save you a copy) to --

Tucson, AZ 85701-1000

Please note: Everyone at Chax Press will be away from Tucson June 10
through June 26, so we won't process any of these orders until very late
June. If you need to talk with us on the phone, please call June 27 or

It has been a pleasure and privilege to work on this book.

Thank you,

For an article, I am writing, I am looking for suggestions for some of the =
most interesting, complex, 'artful' Web-based poems out there-- that is, =
poems that use the web in their construction, are on the web, are =
multimedia. All suggestions appreciated, esp. with URLs so I can get to =
them. Thanks.

Phil Gura, who bought it, was a teacher of mine in graduate school.  Since
he bought it, I bet there's a very good chance it's genuine: he knows
19th-century New England intimately, and he's a very good researcher of
material culture.  (His book on the history of the banjo, by the way, is
great.)

Clark Coolidge comes to mind, especially earlier stuff like _Polaroid_,
which builds gradually from clusters of more-or-less nonreferring words like
particles and prepositions toward slightly more complex strings of slightly
more denotative terms.  It's not purely monosyllabic, but there is a
preponderance.  Ditto with _Space_ and _The Maintains_.

Hi List,

After closely examining both photographs--the genuine and the new ED
photograph, I was struck by two things: First the left eye in both pictures
is an exact match; second--the new image of ED, even after taking age of
sitter and position of sitter's head into consideration, shows a distinctly
swollen lower left jaw.  Did anyone else notice this?  I know that ED had
problems with her eyes, but is there a record of ED experiencing dental
problems?  This is a fascinating photograph.  Professor Gura is to be
congratulated on real find.  Jesse

this being a report (or rather a collection of notes) of the cork poetry
conference i attended last month.  it began with an evening soiree at the=
 home
of alex davis and his wife leigh.  both alex and leigh teach at the=
 university
in cork.  alex was one of the primary organizers of the event along with=
 trevor
joyce.  most of the presenters were there that night and engaged in a lot of
catching up with old friends and acquaintances.  it was mentioned several=
 times
that randolph healy would not be able to attend since he needed to stay=
 close
at home in dublin with his pregnant wife. i got the feeling that randolph=
 was
sorely missed.  also some discussion about the expected arts funding not=
 coming
through and how The Castle Lounge in Dublin came through at the last minute
with some funds.  we also visited the top (fourth) floor of alex's flat with
its fantastic view of downtown cork and its split river.

the next morning began with a reading by j.c.c. (everyone called him jim)
mays.  unfortunately he felt the need to rush through his paper - i guess
because we were starting later than the announced time.  but his talk -=
 called
N11 Musing was a witty meditation in numbered paragraphs on the relation
between writing, reading, and criticism with a focus on the work of brian
coffey and augustus young.  we only heard excerpts from it but the full text
will be published as part of the Coelacanth Press Critical Series edited by
maurice scully.  here's a piece i procured: "Reading a new poem is like=
 living
in the country before it gets overlaid by the ribbon development of=
 commentary,
because, if it's a good poem, it is doomed by a process which reading=
 begins.
Situated at the beginning of the end, the process cuts both ways. The
avant-garde wants to be ahead of the pack, alternative poetry wants to live=
 at
the margins, but success encourages the wheels of destruction to grind=
 towards
them. The more remote the country-dweller, the greater the dependency on a=
 car
and deep-freezer. Opting-out increases the number of points at which you=
 need
to be plugged in. Only those who are totally out of it are nearly free."

next up was billy mills and catherine walsh.  they took several turns -
basically one read for a bit while the other tended the children (niall and
declan).  billy read from 'what is a mountain' and catherine read from 'city
west'.  i remember bombings being featured in billy's readings and then=
 about
30 seconds into catherine's first reading she said POW very loudly - her=
 voice
echoing off the theater's bare walls.  this kept me on edge for the rest of
their reading waiting for something like that to happen again but it never=
 did.

after lunch marcella edwards read a paper. she's a ph.d. student in england=
 who
is writing a dissertation on innovative irish writing/publishing in the 60's
(and 70's?) especially the work of trevor joyce.  i confess to not really
understanding all that she was putting forth - something along the lines of=
 how
poets like (trevor) joyce wrote and published more radically political work
than say heaney and others whose works showed an increase in political
allusions during this time but surely wasn't at risk of stirring up much
trouble.  but obviously most people there understood and were engaged by her
talk because it sparked a lot of conversation and people asking marcella
questions about her work.

next was robert sheppard.  his reading was interesting to me for several
reasons.  i was mesmerized, almost hypnotized by his reading style.  he read
very fast, with a lot of intensity, never looking at the audience and had=
 way
of rocking back and forth that never wavered.  (left foot remained planted=
 at
all times, right foot begins behind the left, then rather long step forward=
 ,
bend from waist a little, then bend even more at the knees, straighten back=
 up,
right foot steps well back, bend backward at the waist, repeat=E2=80=A6) i=
 believe he
was reading from Empty Diaries and the text seemed an interesting mix of
near-angry social critique and more personal accounts.  ah, just remembered=
 one
time when he did look at the audience was when he read some "empty words"=
 which
he did by looking up from the text and mouthing the words silently and
emphatically.  all through the reading i would be able to follow for about
10-20 seconds but then due to the density of the text and his fast/intense
reading style i would 'fog out' for a bit. i guess he intended for the work=
 to
have a cumulative but kinda random effect of ideas and images but i kept
thinking 'i wish i could have the text in my hands and be looking at it=
 while
he's reading.'

guess i should say something about the breaks and lunches and evening social
times.  Beamish!  that's the beer that geoff squires and others turned me
onto.  very good stout - supposedly not as bitter as guinness.  lots of beer=
 at
every break.  occasionally some wine and/or food.  oooh and Caf=C3=A9=
 Paradiso, a
vegetarian paradise for sure amongst all the pubs/grills.  the readings were
cool but i probably enjoyed myself the most talking with everybody in the
pubs.  hung out with geoff squires, marcella edwards, maurice scully, also=
 some
with sheppard, ric caddel (one l), tom raworth, billy and catherine and=
 kids, a
meal with jim mays and wife, erica van horn and her irrascible, entertaining
mate simon cutts, judy kravis, and alex.

somehow tom raworth kept everyone smiling despite the fact that he hardly=
 ever
said anything.  he seemed to do a lot of timely eyebrow raising and mugging=
 at
other's comments.  also he took a lot of pictures with a disposable camera. =
 he
never looked through it, would just hold it up high and 'click' or coyly=
 hold
it at his hip and 'click'.

i was surprised to find that there was almost no talk of poetry during these
social times.

but back to the scheduled readings.  maurice scully read a poem 'variations'
which i was familiar with (we had read it recently at the atlanta poets=
 group)
so it was particularly pleasing to hear it read by maurice.  he also read=
 from
'steps' i believe.  great stuff i thought as apparently did everyone else.

judy kravis.  i was eager to hear her read because i had read some of her
poetry that i found interesting in an issue of shearsman.  but i ended up=
 being
disappointed.  inspired by one of her students who discovered in her class=
 that
the world is strange - and liked it - she wrote some prose that was meant i
believe to explore this strangeness.  but i didn't find it very strange at
all.  it had a surreal tint to it here and there, but otherwise sounded like
normative expressivist fiction.

ric caddel.   he read some 'pieces' that had something to do with a quilt in
the way they were constructed.  his reading style had a wryness that i=
 enjoyed
at times, but i found the text to be just too pretty for my taste. though i
heard several others comment on how much they enjoyed it.

tony baker, a brit who lives in france.  i don't remember much about this
reading except it was long and i couldn't concentrate on it for very long.

cath kenneally.  cath and ken bolton were staying at the same b&b that i was=
 so
i ran into them several times.  quite enjoyable folk.  they live in adelaide
australia but currently have this sweet deal where they are staying in rome=
 for
six months and its being funded by the australian arts council. so they're
writing, hooking up with other writers/artists in rome and hopping around
europe, giving readings, going to exhibits and basically living the life=
 that
most of us probably wish for.  cath had 'warned' me earlier that her writing
was probably more mainstream than most of the poets at the conference.  this
didn't keep me however from smiling at the crafty way she put together her
poems.  she also has work in the latest atlanta review - australian section=
 -
edited by john tranter.

ken bolton.  he read with an openness, almost a hesitancy that went=
 beautifully
with his ohara-inspired poetry.  he engaged the audience with much eye=
 contact
and off-hand comments and received lots of smiles and applause as he=
 finished.

tom raworth.  tom read one poem from Clean and Well Lit and a few from
Tottering State.  the rest of the time he read from Meadow.  i liked all of=
 his
work but especially the more recent stuff from Meadow.  like 'sixty words=
 i've
never used before' which begins: 1937 astragal 1938 constat 1939 gony 1940=
 keck
1941 olid

and finishes: 1994  haurient 1995  decury 1996 stridor

tom ended his reading with the aid of a little palm-sized musical device=
 that
works similar to a player piano.  he had taken ed dorn's signature, enlarged
it, punched holes in it corresponding to the signature and then ran the long
slip of paper through the little machine by turning a small crank on the=
 side
producing something of a melody that lasted probably about 30 seconds.  he
called it a "john cage meets colin nancarrow tribute to my friend ed dorn."

geoff squires.  geoff read for awhile from a poem (in progress i think)=
 called
deliberations.  unlike most of his fellow presenters geoff read somewhat=
 slowly
and with more pauses - due i believe in part to the nature of the text. =
 some
of his "deliberations" included brief pauses for geoff to look at the=
 audience
or gaze out the window.  sounds a little gimmicky as i write about it, but
didn't seem that way to me at the time, especially since the text encouraged
philosophical reflection on epistemology and the way the mind works and=
 attends
(or not). next geoff read some translations he did of persian poets.  geoff,
several years ago apparently, used to teach at a university in iran and did
some translations back then and is just now getting back to refining them. =
 he
read some of his translations from classical poets rudaki, hafez, and rumi.
also a modern poet, naderpoor.  i thought his 'deliberations' were really=
 sharp
and thought the translations pretty plain, but most of the people afterward
were talking about how great the persian translations were.  even niall (age
9?) complimented geoff on the translations.

roz cowman.  like trevor and judy kravis, roz lives in cork.  she seemed to=
 be
an expected part of the local poetry scene.  however her poetry was pretty
unbearable for me.  she typically took 10 minutes before each poem to=
 explain
all the allusions and the composition process for it.

robert sheppard again this time reading a paper that discussed tom raworth's
poetry.  he gave us a handout that showed some of raworth's eternal=
 sections.
somehow he had managed to get a draft of one of the sections and made some
comments how raworth's editing process works.  pretty interesting.

tony baker and harry jalonis read a collaborative work.  afraid i don't
remember too much about this one either except that it seemed they each took
turns reading a line or two.  i think i could have appreciated it more if i
could have understood in what way it was collaboratively put together.

trevor joyce who had missed the previous day's events due to sickness.=
 trevor
had mentioned to me earlier that he was planning on reading a long, new, and
unpublished piece and was going to encourage people to walk out and take a
break when needed.  which i and a few others did. i think he ended up=
 reading
for about 45 minutes straight.

now, at the risk of (at least) revealing my cultural blindspots- a few=
 general
comments. with a few exceptions (raworth, scully, catherine walsh and others
briefly) the readings tended to be quite serious sounding. [i'm talking the
poetry per se and not the papers by mays, edwards, or sheppard.] one brit=
 poet
pointed out to me that he was surprised at how subdued, almost monotone many=
 of
the readers were. another pointed out to me that it seemed to him that most=
 of
the presenters were reading pieces that were really meant to be read on the
page - meaning not orally presented. and i kept wondering where the=
 playfulness
was?  where the linguistic or ideational innovative? both in terms of the
actual texts that were read and in the presentations of the texts.  but this
may have been largely my issue since most of the rest of the audience seemed
pretty 'rapt' up in most of the readings no matter the length or tone.

oh, and speaking of the audience i'll say a bit about the attendance.=
 everyone
there was either brit or irish except for me and the two australians.  and
although no one session had more than 25-30 people attending, i would guess
that the overall conference was probably attended by 50 or more people.  but=
 it
was surprising to me, and disappointing to the organizers and participants,
that even though we were meeting at the University College Cork (12000
students) there was only one student in attendance during the two-day
conference.  overall (from this outsider looking in) it seemed that all the
presenters were very happy to have a chance to get together, hear each=
 other's
poetry and socialize.

thanks to alex davis for inviting me to his house friday night and also
suggesting the great b&b The Garnish House. (i'll never forget those
breakfasts.) and to Geoff Squires for making extra little efforts to include
this odd ameican in the bouts about town.

see ya in cork next year. randy prunty

I did what I usually don't--and checked out the site--and found a mission
statement.  Well I love a mission statement.  This one took the cake, so
much for the "political" of the literary FEMME SOUL--well I guess it _is_
political to be reductionist about radical feminism.  Not to declaim the
novel.

yours,
radically feminist/femmely homo
--rdlevitsky

here's a juicy tidbit:

"At first, Femme Soul addressed women. It was a call to create a magazine
that treated women with some dignity and intelligence. But, women cannot and
should not exist without men. Femme Soul ,is, in its essence, a response to
the counter-culture (the refined counter-culture of our popular
entertainment) and to radical feminists who would have us all made
androgynous. It is a place for writers to talk about current cultural
trends, literature, art, music, movies, politics, ideas, and offer original
works of creative fiction. Such an endeavor should not be limited to women.

"In short, Femme Soul hopes to revive American culture, not undermine it."

The tone has darkened since '2' clicked up on our digital calendars. I
suppose this is what the 21st century will be like---no privacy left,
noplace to hide. It's not for me. I might have misbehaved in the Moose Room
at Bowering Manor, but I surprised myself when I did. I cannot imagine the
depths to which Maria (and, by implication, George) have sunk, that they
have already made arrangements to be swept off their feet, and know the
precise location of this fit. (Btw, Maria, Burton assures me that is the
_Knotty_ Pine Lounge.)  This is getting too rich for my blood, my dears. I
like to back into things of this sort. I like to pretend they aren't
happening until they are over.

 True, I _had_ hoped...no. Well, dammit, I will speak : I had hoped,
George, that you.....that you and I.....but I see clearly now. Maria has
usurped my place in your affections. How unkind of the both of you not to
let me hear about this before I had purchased my ticket. So I must come to
Orono and introduce your reading, George, and so I shall--and for a good
long time, you may be sure-- but you may well picture what will be going on
in my heart as I do so. --How wise of Rachel to stay home, tending her
keepsakes from the 60's, and writing her sizzling limericks.  When we see
the complications she evades, it's a wonder we don't all do likewise. Btw,
Anthony and Cleopatra, the title of her book is _Hotel Emporium_ , and it
offers a poetic critique of market-based societies.

 Another virtue of home is that everyone here knows how to spell my name.

Broadbent.

Hell's bells, I see Brognitz is back in a big way with a shot across the
bow.  But he's right.  My collection of lava lamps, Sopwith Camel albums
and Owsley blue dots is unparalleled, or it was before David made me
send him the blue dots.  He says he wants them to try to pry George away
from Maria in Orono.  I wish him luck, but I hope Burton Hatlen or Ron
Silliman will be there to talk him down if this doesn't work.

Given such faithless playmates, is it any wonder that my life has taken
a Taoist turn?  "Men ask the way to Cold Mountain / Cold Mountain:
there's no through trail . . . How did I make it? / My heart's not the
same as yours. / If your heart was like mine / You'd get it and be right
here."

No, my heart is different.  Good-bye my darlings!  May you take as good
care of each other as you have always taken of me.

Our baby, Thomas Theodore, was born at home last Friday at 11.23 am. A
bright and sturdy little thing, adored by his four sisters. Louise is in
great form. The entire labour lasted 38 minutes and this time the midwife
managed to get here before it was all over.  You can see a picture of Teddy
at Louise's website:

Above the world-weary horizons=20
New obstacles for exchange arise=20
Or unfold, O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List was founded by Charles Bernstein in late 1993
with the epigraph above. Now in its second incarnation, the list
carries over 600 subscribers, though all of these subscribers do
not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A number of
other people read the Poetics List via our web archives at the
Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list, as articulated in this Welcome Message. We remain committed
to this editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics
List. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions
in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and
investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise
unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

=3DThe Poetics List is no longer a discussion list as such.=3D Due
to the increasing number of subscribers and the need for close
moderation, we are no longer able to maintain the open format
with which the list began. Rather, we encourage subscribers to
post information on publications and reading series that they
have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear.
Such announcements constitute a core function of this list. For
further information on posting to the list, see section 5 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your real name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list must provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include
all of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, simply re-subscribe to the list
(once your account problem has been resolved!) by sending
this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, submissions relating to politics and political news
will also be considered. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential.

Unsolicited submissions are welcome. In particular, we encourage
subscribers to post information on publications and reading
series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in
which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function
of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g., event
reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).
Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate;
we request that the posting subscriber assemble "highlights"
from respondents' posts to be published to the list. *PLEASE
NOTE: All submissions should be sent to the poetics list at
<poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>, and not to the editors.*

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) will
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List must abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual
subscribers address.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or thank
someone for posting something you requested, please send the
request or comment directly to that individual, and not to the
list editors.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text". Note,
however, there is no problem with sending clickable URLs in
HTML format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents in a post, since this may make it difficult for
those who get the list via "digest" or who cannot decode
attached or specially formatted files. The use of "styled"
text or HTML formatting in the body of email posts to the
list appears not to be compatible with the the list's
automatic digest program; as a result such messages disrupt
the format of the Digest, even though this coding is
readable for some subscribers who do not use the digest
option.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

      set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

-------------------

10. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: The Electronic Poetry Center listings of
poetry and poetics information is open and available to you. We
are trying to make access to printed publications as easy as
possible for our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate!

Send a list of your press/publications to
<glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu>, with the words EPC Press Listing in
the subject line.

You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail
message to the address above to obtain a mailing address to
which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your word
processor will save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is
also highly desirable.

Send us extended information on new publications (including any
back cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs or
backlists (including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).
Be sure to include full information for ordering--including prices
and addresses and phone numbers both of the press and any
distributors.

You might also want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics List as subscribers do not always (or ever)
check the EPC; in your message please include full  information for
ordering. If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention
that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have
received a noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to
promote your publication and we are glad to facilitate information
about interesting publications.

Alas, I shan't be there in Orono to defend Maria's honor, but as I recall,
putting Rubber Soul or Revolution right at the point when your jaw starts to
tighten prior to the peak insures the most mellow of journeys.

But as for blue dots, I always preferred Sandoz.

Moving along a singular "line of flight" of his own from Playboy.com to
Britannica.com

the web-based editor Rodger Brown has given me the go-ahead to post the
following open-armed request for interesting literature/cultural studies
materials from britannica.com [see below]

a site I take to be a potentially interesting venue for some "news that
stays news" (meaning poetics)...

or challenges the normative pieties (repressive syntax?) of 'clear
simple prose'?  Then again, not to get too ludic or utopic, maybe not.

from: randy prunty, RanPrunty@aol.com

this being a report (or rather a collection of notes) of the cork poetry
conference i attended last month.  it began with an evening soiree at the
home of alex davis and his wife leigh.  both alex and leigh teach at the
university in cork.  alex was one of the primary organizers of the event
along with trevor joyce.  most of the presenters were there that night and =

engaged in a lot of catching up with old friends and acquaintances.  it =
was
mentioned several times that randolph healy would not be able to attend
since
he needed to stay close at home in dublin with his pregnant wife. i got =
the
feeling that randolph was sorely missed.  also some discussion about the
expected arts funding not coming through and how The Castle Lounge in
Dublin
came through at the last minute with some funds.  we also visited the top
(fourth) floor of alex's flat with its fantastic view of downtown cork and =

its split river.

the next morning began with a reading by j.c.c. (everyone called him jim)
mays.  unfortunately he felt the need to rush through his paper - i guess
because we were starting later than the announced time.  but his talk -
called N11 Musing was a witty meditation in numbered paragraphs on the
relation between writing, reading, and criticism with a focus on the work
of
brian coffey and augustus young.  we only heard excerpts from it but the
full
text will be published as part of the Coelacanth Press Critical Series
edited
by maurice scully.  here's a piece i procured:
"Reading a new poem is like living in the country before it gets overlaid
by
the ribbon development of commentary, because, if it's a good poem, it is
doomed by a process which reading begins. Situated at the beginning of the =

end, the process cuts both ways. The avant-garde wants to be ahead of the
pack, alternative poetry wants to live at the margins, but success
encourages
the wheels of destruction to grind towards them. The more remote the
country-dweller, the greater the dependency on a car and deep-freezer.
Opting-out increases the number of points at which you need to be plugged
in.
Only those who are totally out of it are nearly free."

next up was billy mills and catherine walsh.  they took several turns -
basically one read for a bit while the other tended the children (niall =
and
declan).  billy read from 'what is a mountain' and catherine read from
'city
west'.  i remember bombings being featured in billy's readings and then
about
30 seconds into catherine's first reading she said POW very loudly - her
voice echoing off the theater's bare walls.  this kept me on edge for the
rest of their reading waiting for something like that to happen again but
it
never did.

after lunch marcella edwards read a paper. she's a ph.d. student in =
england
who is writing a dissertation on innovative irish writing/publishing in =
the
60's (and 70's?) especially the work of trevor joyce.  i confess to not
really understanding all that she was putting forth - something along the
lines of how poets like (trevor) joyce wrote and published more radically
political work than say heaney and others whose works showed an increase =
in
political allusions during this time but surely wasn't at risk of stirring
up
much trouble.  but obviously most people there understood and were engaged
by
her talk because it sparked a lot of conversation and people asking
marcella
questions about her work.

next was robert sheppard.  his reading was interesting to me for several
reasons.  i was mesmerized, almost hypnotized by his reading style.  he
read
very fast, with a lot of intensity, never looking at the audience and had
way
of rocking back and forth that never wavered.  (left foot remained planted
at
all times, right foot begins behind the left, then rather long step =
forward
,
bend from waist a little, then bend even more at the knees, straighten =
back
up, right foot steps well back, bend backward at the waist, =
repeat=E2=80=A6) i
believe he was reading from Empty Diaries and the text seemed an
interesting
mix of near-angry social critique and more personal accounts.  ah, just
remembered one time when he did look at the audience was when he read some =

"empty words" which he did by looking up from the text and mouthing the
words
silently and emphatically.  all through the reading i would be able to
follow
for about 10-20 seconds but then due to the density of the text and his
fast/intense reading style i would 'fog out' for a bit. i guess he =
intended
for the work to have a cumulative but kinda random effect of ideas and
images
but i kept thinking 'i wish i could have the text in my hands and be
looking
at it while he's reading.'

guess i should say something about the breaks and lunches and evening
social
times.  Beamish!  that's the beer that geoff squires and others turned me
onto.  very good stout - supposedly not as bitter as guinness.  lots of
beer
at every break.  occasionally some wine and/or food.  oooh and Caf=C3=A9
Paradiso,
a vegetarian paradise for sure amongst all the pubs/grills.  the readings
were cool but i probably enjoyed myself the most talking with everybody in =

the pubs.  hung out with geoff squires, marcella edwards, maurice scully,
also some with sheppard, ric caddel (one l), tom raworth, billy and
catherine
and kids, a meal with jim mays and wife, erica van horn and her =
irrascible,
entertaining mate simon cutts, judy kravis, and alex.

somehow tom raworth kept everyone smiling despite the fact that he hardly
ever said anything.  he seemed to do a lot of timely eyebrow raising and
mugging at other's comments.  also he took a lot of pictures with a
disposable camera.  he never looked through it, would just hold it up high =

and 'click' or coyly hold it at his hip and 'click'.

i was surprised to find that there was almost no talk of poetry during
these
social times.

but back to the scheduled readings.  maurice scully read a poem
'variations'
which i was familiar with (we had read it recently at the atlanta poets
group) so it was particularly pleasing to hear it read by maurice.  he =
also
read from 'steps' i believe.  great stuff i thought as apparently did
everyone else.

judy kravis.  i was eager to hear her read because i had read some of her
poetry that i found interesting in an issue of shearsman.  but i ended up
being disappointed.  inspired by one of her students who discovered in her =

class that the world is strange - and liked it - she wrote some prose that =

was meant i believe to explore this strangeness.  but i didn't find it =
very
strange at all.  it had a surreal tint to it here and there, but otherwise =

sounded like normative expressivist fiction.

ric caddel.   he read some 'pieces' that had something to do with a quilt
in
the way they were constructed.  his reading style had a wryness that i
enjoyed at times, but i found the text to be just too pretty for my taste. =

though i heard several others comment on how much they enjoyed it.

tony baker, a brit who lives in france.  i don't remember much about this
reading except it was long and i couldn't concentrate on it for very long. =


cath kenneally.  cath and ken bolton were staying at the same b&b that i
was
so i ran into them several times.  quite enjoyable folk.  they live in
adelaide australia but currently have this sweet deal where they are
staying
in rome for six months and its being funded by the australian arts =
council.
so they're writing, hooking up with other writers/artists in rome and
hopping
around europe, giving readings, going to exhibits and basically living the =

life that most of us probably wish for.  cath had 'warned' me earlier that =

her writing was probably more mainstream than most of the poets at the
conference.  this didn't keep me however from smiling at the crafty way =
she
put together her poems.  she also has work in the latest atlanta review -
australian section - edited by john tranter.

ken bolton.  he read with an openness, almost a hesitancy that went
beautifully with his ohara-inspired poetry.  he engaged the audience with
much eye contact and off-hand comments and received lots of smiles and
applause as he finished.

tom raworth.  tom read one poem from Clean and Well Lit and a few from
Tottering State.  the rest of the time he read from Meadow.  i liked all =
of
his work but especially the more recent stuff from Meadow.  like 'sixty
words
i've never used before' which begins:
1937 astragal
1938 constat
1939 gony
1940 keck
1941 olid

and finishes:
1994  haurient
1995  decury
1996 stridor

tom ended his reading with the aid of a little palm-sized musical device
that
works similar to a player piano.  he had taken ed dorn's signature,
enlarged
it, punched holes in it corresponding to the signature and then ran the
long
slip of paper through the little machine by turning a small crank on the
side
producing something of a melody that lasted probably about 30 seconds.  he =

called it a "john cage meets colin nancarrow tribute to my friend ed =
dorn."

geoff squires.  geoff read for awhile from a poem (in progress i think)
called deliberations.  unlike most of his fellow presenters geoff read
somewhat slowly and with more pauses - due i believe in part to the nature
of
the text.  some of his "deliberations" included brief pauses for geoff to
look at the audience or gaze out the window.  sounds a little gimmicky as =
i
write about it, but didn't seem that way to me at the time, especially
since
the text encouraged philosophical reflection on epistemology and the way
the
mind works and attends (or not).
next geoff read some translations he did of persian poets.  geoff, several =

years ago apparently, used to teach at a university in iran and did some
translations back then and is just now getting back to refining them.  he
read some of his translations from classical poets rudaki, hafez, and =
rumi.

also a modern poet, naderpoor.  i thought his 'deliberations' were really
sharp and thought the translations pretty plain, but most of the people
afterward were talking about how great the persian translations were.  =
even
niall (age 9?) complimented geoff on the translations.

roz cowman.  like trevor and judy kravis, roz lives in cork.  she seemed =
to
be an expected part of the local poetry scene.  however her poetry was
pretty
unbearable for me.  she typically took 10 minutes before each poem to
explain
all the allusions and the composition process for it.

robert sheppard again this time reading a paper that discussed tom
raworth's
poetry.  he gave us a handout that showed some of raworth's eternal
sections.
 somehow he had managed to get a draft of one of the sections and made =
some
comments how raworth's editing process works.  pretty interesting.

tony baker and harry jalonis read a collaborative work.  afraid i don't
remember too much about this one either except that it seemed they each
took
turns reading a line or two.  i think i could have appreciated it more if =
i
could have understood in what way it was collaboratively put together.

trevor joyce who had missed the previous day's events due to sickness.
trevor had mentioned to me earlier that he was planning on reading a long, =

new, and unpublished piece and was going to encourage people to walk out
and
take a break when needed.  which i and a few others did. i think he ended
up
reading for about 45 minutes straight.

now, at the risk of (at least) revealing my cultural blindspots- a few
general comments. with a few exceptions (raworth, scully, catherine walsh
and
others briefly) the readings tended to be quite serious sounding. [i'm
talking the poetry per se and not the papers by mays, edwards, or
sheppard.]
one brit poet pointed out to me that he was surprised at how subdued,
almost
monotone many of the readers were. another pointed out to me that it =
seemed
to him that most of the presenters were reading pieces that were really
meant
to be read on the page - meaning not orally presented. and i kept =
wondering
where the playfulness was?  where the linguistic or ideational innovative? =

both in terms of the actual texts that were read and in the presentations
of
the texts.  but this may have been largely my issue since most of the rest
of
the audience seemed pretty 'rapt' up in most of the readings no matter the =

length or tone.

oh, and speaking of the audience i'll say a bit about the attendance.
everyone there was either brit or irish except for me and the two
australians.  and although no one session had more than 25-30 people
attending, i would guess that the overall conference was probably attended
by
50 or more people.  but it was surprising to me, and disappointing to the
organizers and participants, that even though we were meeting at the
University College Cork (12000 students) there was only one student in
attendance during the two-day conference.  overall (from this outsider
looking in) it seemed that all the presenters were very happy to have a
chance to get together, hear each other's poetry and socialize.

thanks to alex davis for inviting me to his house friday night and also
suggesting the great b&b The Garnish House. (i'll never forget those
breakfasts.) and to Geoff Squires for making extra little efforts to
include
this odd ameican in the bouts about town.

see ya in cork next year.

Ages ago there was a thread concerning the relationship between language
poetry and the cliche, and though everyone else has probably forgotten that
thread, I'll put in my two cents with this brilliant bit from Kit
Robinson's "On the Corner":

The sun goes down
into the town's
back pocket
like a figure of speech.

Okay -- I admit that none of the lines are really cliches per se, except
for that time worn trope of the sung going down, but it's pretty evident
how the last line would work to revise the time-worn in any line that
preceded it.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  On Thursday, this week, we're
putting on another piece of Poets Theater to which all are invited.

Small Press Traffic and San Francisco Art Institute present

Thursday, June 15, 2000
THE SHAKERS
a new play by Kevin Killian and Wayne Smith

San Francisco Art Institute Auditorium
800 Chestnut Street (North Beach), San Francisco
7:30 p.m.
$5 admission

Shortly after the US Civil War, during the American Renaissance, a
small band of spiritual pioneers live simply on a rural commune,
rejecting the temptations of the outside world.  United in their
devotion to Mother Ann Lee (but separated by gender), they invent
ingenious chairs still used today: rocking, high, electric and wheel,
among others.  In religious ecstasy. they often whirl, tremble and
shake on the floor, hence the name "Shakers."  But wrinkles are
beginning to appear in their nineteenth century utopia of clean
lines.  A rebellious Shaker girl with amnesia begins naming the stars
in the sky and dares to dream of a life outside her village; an aged
patriarch hides a shameful secret; an old woman tells fortunes by
listening to apples ripen; a wounded and bitter Civil War veteran
watches as his world divides in two; and a vagabond poet/male nurse
makes chocolates for everyone.  Near the end, a new broom is invented.

With a cast of San Francisco poets and painters including Rupert
Adley, Elliott Anderson, Taylor Brady, Norma Cole, Phoebe Gloeckner,
Craig Goodman, Glen Helfand, Clifford Hengst, Marisa Hernandez, Scott
Hewicker, Tanya Hollis, Kevin Killian, Yedda Morrison, Rex Ray,
Jocelyn Saidenberg, Cedar Sigo and Wayne Smith.

This is a benefit for POETS IN NEED, the brand new non-profit
organization based in Pacifica founded among others by Michael
Rothenberg, Lyn Hejinian and Leslie Scalapino to alleviate the
immediate health and/or economic emergencies of poets and other
artists.  So bring your checkbook if possible and learn more about
this worthy new group.  All contributions are tax-deductible.

SISTER RAY.  You've only been here in Hancock Village one year.  When
we found you on the side of the road, and you came to, in the dairy,
you already knew how to read, but you couldn't churn.

POLLY.  What are you implying?

SISTER RAY.  Well, look at this article I saw in the News.  It's a
story about a young girl from Amherst, Emily Dickinson, who
disappeared from her family's home one year ago today.  And there's a
picture in it that looks a bit like you.

POLLY.  She doesn't look like me at all!  That girl Emily has
cross-hatching.  She's aloof, stuck-up, full of herself.  I'm a more
natural, communal kind of person.

SISTER RAY.  I hate to think of some poor Amherst family missing
their daughter.  Their beautiful, beautiful young daughter . . .
Emily .  . . wondering where she is . . .  night after night.  Such a
separation must be unbearable for them.  No, Polly.  It most
certainly couldn't be you.

POLLY.  Of course she's not, Sister Ray.  I know who I am and I'm not her.

SISTER RAY.  Right!  Forget I said anything.

Aw, I was hoping that Silliman would be there, because I dont think
we have met, have we? I dont think he/you was/were at the 1963 poetry
extravaganza at UBC. Now i will have to make do with guys like
Bromige. Dont get me wrong--I like David, but really, the thrill is
off the peach, or however that expression goes.

Sheesh. What sentimental maundering on Rachel's part. How humiliating, to
be made to watch how a mere case of thwarted passion can undo such a
mistress of tone. Because it has happened to each of us, somewhere between
the painted ponies and the crudely carved ostriches.--- Rachel, stop
already with this 'farewell for ever' shtick. It's like reading Charles
Bernstein and asking,'Is he sincere?' knowing the answer to be 'Of course
he is!'  Believe that I will always be yours, at precisely the same
distance you opt for.  I was only kidding abt me and G., trying to shock
people again. Pathetic. Tell the truth, i'm looking forward to seeing them
reunited (particularly Maria). Sylvester has reserved me a ringside seat.
Well, actually, he told me there are all kinds of seats, as little interest
has been shown in this ahem 'panel'.

The blue dots were spectacular. about 4 hours into the trip I joined them
all up. The result looked like Ron Silliman applying vinyl* to his face
(v."Blue Dots," Silliman, Poetics List, Monday, June 12 :

> as I recall, putting Rubber Soul or Revolution right at the point when
>your >jaw starts to tighten prior to the peak insures the most mellow of
>journeys.)

 *.Vinyl from the Vinyl Vatican, no doubt (v. Silliman, in _Ron Silliman
and the Alphabet_, Quarry West 34, eds. Vogler and Marshall, Porter
College, UC Santa Cruz, 1998, p.12).

Rachel, mention of Santa Cruz reminds me of that time you were unable to
meet when I was en route there. Did it make me sad? Yes, but only because I
find enlightenment a struggle. Now, now we are about not to meet in Orono,
aidez-moi! Show me your strength---help me to see how, like the lovers on
Keats' immortal Urn, we should therefore always be happy!

As for G and M.....

Subject:      Fair Use: Quoting Poetics List Posts?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Dear List:

A quick query about quoting from posts to the Poetics List...

Specifically, I wonder if there are list rules about quoting from
list-member posts: quoting, that is, in an essay intended for publication.
I seem to remember some such set of guidelines in the dim and distant past
(before I took a long hiatus from the list in 98-99) but can't find it via
the EPC archives.

I ask because I'm currently writing an essay on Charles Bernstein's *My
Way* and find some listee comments about poetry/community/identity to be
highly germane to parts of the book.  However, I don't want to tread on
any copyrighted or private-domain toes.  If no-one can answer this query
I'll just resort to general description, will name no names and quote no
quotations, and will direct my (putative) readers to the EPC archives in a
footnote.

Cheers,

Matt Hart.

PS: The new archives are fabulous.  Thanks a lot for that work!

Wow.  My computer is still smoking from the influx of e-mail about
Samizdat #5.

I'm sad to say that, despite having printed more copies than ever, we've
now used up the supply of free issus set aside for list-folk.  (Issues
can still be ordered for $3.50, three-issue subscriptions $10).

I can only make sense of this run on the Eshleman issue by concluding
that a lot of people already miss Sulfur as much as I do.

Thanks to everyone who backchanneled.  We should have those in the mail
in a week or so.

in my medieval tunic and my feathered cap.
And the seasons, they come and they go-

The dry eyes of the weeping willow
will soon pour forth their tears again,
crying for joy at the coming of spring.

Or are they only green with envy
at the yellow ribbons in the forsythia's hair?

Meanwhile, cum drips from your ass
'cause you just got fucked in the Ramble.

Note:  The Falconer is a bronze statue in New York's Central Park.  The
Ramble is a wilderness preserve of tangled pathways that serves as a
cruising ground for gay men.

No, it's not, and I felt that the poem quote was the only perjoritive in my post.
Did I question the existence of right wing feminists or the feminism of those who
choose to link to the Eagle Forum?  No.  Did I do anything more than identify the
labels the writers use to identify themselves on their sites and through their
associations?

I do feel that these labels and associations throw the mission statement on the
femmesoul site into context.

I did post quite a while back on the politicalization of reading and phonics.  As
you know, theories and practices of phonics teaching common before World War II
are now supported by American conservatives.

The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle
by Haruki Murakami

Below is Amazon's write-up, 'cause I'm swamped with work and school. But
Murakami is amazing--a pop-culture Japanese Kafka. And I love Kafka, so
don't invoke his name often... Delicious writing!


"Haruki Murakami is a master of subtly disturbing prose. Mundane events
throb with menace, while the bizarre is accepted without comment. Meaning
always seems to be just out of reach, for the reader as well as for the
characters, yet one is drawn inexorably into a mystery that may have no
solution. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is an extended meditation on themes
that appear throughout Murakami's earlier work. The tropes of popular
culture, movies, music, detective stories, combine to create a work that
explores both the surface and the hidden depths of Japanese society at the
end of the 20th century."

Hey all,

I'll be in New York in late June and early July and would love the
opportunity to give a reading somewhere (Manhatten/Brooklyn environs).
Possible dates would include June 27,28,29 or July 7,8,9.  I know it's
short notice with serious date constraints, but if the opportunity arises .
. .  If you don't know my work, but are curious, check out

I received this message from Paul Quinn in London. Those wishing to express
their support for Compendium can write to Mike Hart, although Paul notes that
international support may well have no impact on the fate of this great
bookstore.

_____________
Forwarded Letter from Paul Quinn:
Compendium books of Camden town in closing in September. This shop has, I would
argue, a vital role in British culture where small press material is concerned.
It is just about the only place where small press poetry etc can be encountered
and read on the racks. I have lost count of the number of poets and writers I
first encountered there ... in its estimable poetry section. The closure will
mean that small press poetry will only be distributed here by private mailing
lists etc. -- all well and good, but it removes the possibility of those who
aren`t already committed to this kind of material (THE crucial audience, I`d
argue) coming across it. Mike at Compendium has been equally dedicated to
stocking the best American and British small press poetry. There is literally
no where else that goes much beyond the usual big publishers. Maybe it`s just a
sign of the times and nothing can be done, but I thought I`d at least alert
those who might have an interest. A vital connection between international
innovative poetries is about to be lost.

Did I say that you said what I implied that you said when you implied it?
No.   Leaving aside the femmesoul site (since I know little of their mission
statement, have no religious faith/affiliations, am merely amused by
ideologues right and left), in general ideas should be judged according to
criteria other than the labels and associations of their cheerleaders.  Did
T. S.  Eliot have some good ideas?  Yup.  Do I fancy his "royalism"?  Nope.
Does that change the quality of his ideas?  Again, nope.  The good ones stay
good; the bad ones stay bad.  Otherwise we have what politicos call "spin."
Am I wrong about this?   Always a possibility since, as my wife says, being
wrong is one of my best things.  And it's nice that American Conservatives
are embracing phonics.  They can join the truckload of American Liberals who
also swear by the method.   After all, the point is to get these kids to
read.  And I thought that poem interesting for its concealed depravity (the
mask cracked just a bit on the word "saliva").  No personal attacks from me,
Catherine--ever.  Just the fun of sharing ideas, agreeing and disagreeing,
learning from so many bright people.  And I used to hate computers!!  Take
care, Bill

i'm looking for manifestos that particularly deal with some aspect of
technology such as the futurist and cyborg and unabomber do. i've got
poems for the

too.

Someone tell this fellow that it wasnt Keats's Urn. t belonged to the
Royal Ipswich Museum of Crockery. Keats was only meditating upon it
in order to write his immortal ditty of lotsa tone.

Only met Ernst Jandle once, in London, when we read together (and with Allen=

Ginsberg & Co) at the Royal Albert Hall in the antediluvian nineteen-sixties=
.=20
 He was a great grumpy sweet grumpy very funny grumpy guy.  Here are three o=
f=20
his poems in my translation (Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop=92s Burning Deck Boo=
ks=20
will bring out a selection of his work in the near future):

CONSULTATION

well no one ever thought you were sane.


SMALL GERIATRIC MANIFESTO

at the age of sixty-two. =20
you=92ll go on masturbating,=20
perhaps not quite as vigorously=20
nor quite as frequently=20
as in your best years.
what you now believe you=92re experiencing
as mental deterioration

your physical deterioration.  the latter is

Joe, would you forward this to the Buffalo Poetics List? I doubt it would
get through, but I see no reason not give their editor a chance to play fair
and be open-minded. Thanks, Joe. - Gabe

If you are interested in a double broadside of a long insult poem
directed at Charles Bernstein, please send $2 (or best offer) to

Oasis Press
c/o Stephen Ellis
23 Mitton Street
Portland, Maine  04102

And ask for Oasia Broadside 63, "A Defense of Poetry"

Here is a selection from this work:

       "6   Is your butt driving through traffic

        that it should toot so at the world? I
        am averse to urine, yet I shake your hand
        upon occasion.

    7   I have made a whiskey of your tears -- and
        Joe-Bob made flu-liqueur of your night-mucus.

    8   That some of your gas has been banging
        around the market like small soldier
        carrying a table. God booby.

    9   I overlook your titties. Your sneeze erased
        the blackboard and your cough knocked a
        dog into loneliness...."

As an added bonus, this double broadside includes extensive footnotes,
each one containing a virulent wish.  In addition, this handsome broadside
includes a long (14 stanzas of 6 to 8 lines) narrative explanation of how
I caught my cold at Lindisfarne when it was attacked by large marauders in
the 9th century.

Matt and all,
My understanding of this has always been that posting to
the Poetics List is a form a publication in the "public
domain" and therefore that posts may be quoted in the same
manner that a printed (non-virtual) article might be.
I haven't had a chance to read Joel K.'s edited volume
_Poetics@_ but it might have something to say about this
as well.

For the next two issues, I'm a poetry editor for Salt Hill journal out of
Syracuse U.  Some of you will be getting solitications, but everyone is
welcome to submit poems.  Put my name on 'em and send them over to:

Arielle Greenberg
Salt Hill
Syracuse University
English Dept
Syracuse, NY 13244

We are also looking for "creative nonfiction" -- non-traditional essays,
memoirs, etc.  If you have any of those, send them to the above but write
"creative nonfiction" on the envelope.

Salt Hill is a nice-looking journal, full-color cover, distributed
nationwide.  In the past they've published Creeley, Lucia Perillo, and
Stephanie Strickland , but the aesthetic changes with the editors year to
year.

We also take hypertext and you can check us out at www-hl.syr.edu/cwp.

Thanks,

Arielle

Catherine thanks for the illumination on that site.  Pro-sex right wing
feminists screaming GENDER IS NOT DEAD!  No, it's absolutely manifest in
tawdry cyber-fantasy.

Where do art and politics collide?  Well to me, the outsider, especially in
this country, usually unravel more remarkably, (if art be unravelling) which
is not to say their have not been fascinating fascist outsiders in the past,
esp within futurism.  Where is the compelling ultra right today? Where is
the compelling ultra left?

And this one has been bothering me.
And why did Alger Hiss feel the need to clear his name?

Assuming Dr. Carter's call to be a poem or similar act of imaginative
literature, I have responded to the generosity and generativity - the
wealth-creating mechanisms - of his act of poiesis, in kind (standards of
exchange, the dream of a common language, a kind of process-writing). The
value of such unregulated reciprocity "(and the assumptions we make about
what is appropriate to teach or emphasize) comes not only from essential
disciplinary concepts, but also from ethics, the environment, the law,
society, and aesthetics."
...............................................

Communication disciplines add a great deal of value to our students.
Our students add up and remit the license fees, or get cut.

Or we cut it out of them. Right down to core competencies.

The cultural and intellectual centrality of the free market: fries with that
sticky content? Heavy after such a lunch, the weight
adds balance to the prevailing Marxist perspective - equilibrium-point-n, a
"logic of the supplement" complete with vinyl kink accessories. Appropriate
submissions: I forget to kick the guy sealing the deal on his cell phone as
he stands on my toe, 5 Fulton line, 5:30pm. "Your guy had better be there,
or the motherfucking VC's gonna tear me a new one." Every such day adds
balance, adding to the balance. Exactly enough plus a lot more. The core
composition curriculum.

My students always wrote 'I feel' to replace the cogito, itself doing double
duty for the sum. The added value was taxing. Then, breaking character, she
says, "When the market serves to balance Marx, I'll disembalm Lenin and
shoot him again myself."

Value creation and academic activity:
fixed or variable interest on that loan?

Or cut and run.

A market-driven approach to documentation and other products.
Add that to your balance at biweekly intervals until either it

or Marx prevails. Perspective
tears you a new one. That's
an innovation in the form
of the personal essay.
Academic entrepreneurship.

Discipline adds value, vinyl kink to start, leather for the connoisseur who
got promoted. "So you're one of the leather people? How much will a really
good leather outfit set you back?"* At least a paycheck. Every two weeks you
grow a new skin. Who gets flayed in the compare-and-contrast exercise, and
what academic product emerges from that ideal dialectic? You are branded
with a brand no one can ever accuse again of standing in for your
speculative identity - it has one all its own.

It sends you voice-mail. Gives you the buzz -
a market-driven approach to documentation.
Open-source it, then screw them on the tech assist.

Our core competencies and how well we manage them:
congratulations, you have found your voices. Best backup
singers in the system, and they won't cost you a dime.

Hello,
Below is a long press release detailing the Railroad Earth publishing
festival beginning this Sunday 18th at RRE and ending the following Friday
the 23rd at The Earl, with events in between.  Essentially, this festival
formalizes our artistic and production community on a more professional
level, pushing us to publish and promote the work we care about.

Our work ranges from song to science, spoken word to virtual worlds,
fantastic constructions of digital space to disorders of the real.  In
short, Railroad Earth is building the critical mass, and we'd like to see
you at one of these events or at least, interest you in a compact disk by
one of the artists.

The web site will be updated on Wednesday. www.rre.net Check for times.
Also check this week's Creative Loafing article about us in the art section.




Atlanta--Railroad Earth (RRE), Atlanta's high tech, internationally
networked arts community and media production facility, is pleased to
present a weeklong multimedia festival June 18-23, 2000.  Over 15 CDs
produced by Railroad Earth will be released and made available to the
public.  Works include music CDs and CD-ROMs with text, video, graphics and
hypertext.  Performances and presentations by the artists will accompany
the releases.  The festival marks the launch of Railroad Earth's Publishing

Williams, Anne Richardson, Glenn Weinstein, Bill Taft and others.  Food
will be present.

On Monday, June 19th, at 8pm, Eyedrum, located at 253 Trinity Ave, will
host the festival as part of its Identity Papers Series.  Visual artist,

music.  Additionally, he will present and contextualize "Con/Text/Sub", a
collection of texts, music and visual art by New York artist and curator
Alan Sondheim.  Both CDs were produced at RRE.

Wednesday, June 21st, from 8:30-10pm the Railroad Earth Studios (address
above), will present painter and digital artist Maurice Clifford, who will

Project is sponsored in part by the City of Atlanta Bureau of Cultural
Affairs.  A CD-ROM of the project will be released and available.

If in doubt, why not ask anyone you want to quote for their permission,
which I'm sure most people would give.  Not naming names/quoting quotes
seems boring: I assume you wouldn't get to some of the substance which was
your whole reason for wanting to quote-- hence your post.  While referring
readers to the archives *may* be a solution, I find that searching the
archives works best when you have a pretty good idea what it is you're
looking for.

Keats' urn, George, in the sense that you are Damon's Bowering, Loden's
Brewering, and... My god! here where men sit and split some last sad hairs.
Next you'll be telling us it wasnt Keats' nightingale either. Here where
men sit and hear each other groan.  And it wasnt Keats' heart,
either.....but the world's.

Is "pro-sex" now "right-wing"? This would be a distressing development
indeed. Perhaps Rachel meant to limit these adjectives only to this
particular web-site?

On another matter . . . the blue dots recently under discussion by Ms. Loden
and Mr. Silliman . . . I didn't see them on the agenda of the Orono
conference. Surely a misprint? I'm sure an illuminating paper could be
presented on their connection to poetic activity of that time . . .

Catherine thanks for the illumination on that site.  Pro-sex right wing
feminists screaming GENDER IS NOT DEAD!  No, it's absolutely manifest in
tawdry cyber-fantasy.

Where do art and politics collide?  Well to me, the outsider, especially in
this country, usually unravel more remarkably, (if art be unravelling) which
is not to say their have not been fascinating fascist outsiders in the past,
esp within futurism.  Where is the compelling ultra right today? Where is
the compelling ultra left?

And this one has been bothering me.
And why did Alger Hiss feel the need to clear his name?

A question for the list:  I've got a friend who's putting together a
proposal for a volume of essays on poetics written by practicing poets.
The table of contents so far starts with Whitman and Poe & runs up to
the present & I've advised him on some more contemporary and
experimental stuff to include, but my advice gets a little fuzzy
Post-Langpo.  So
the question is this: are there any essays out there by younger,
experimental types that you'd like to nominate for canonical status?  I
have the *Poetics of Criticism* volume ready to hand, and this is
probably a good place to start, but I'd like to have some
recommendations of individual essays (either from that volume or
elsewhere) that people would strongly recommend.

Thanks much,
Steve

Mime-Version: 1.0

Once one posts to the Poetics list it is already part of the "permanent
record." And it's curious that one would fear taht something posted to the
internet would end up on "internet searches"!

The interesting question here is, What is the nature of this "context",
really, that desires (demands) to be protected? Isn't it more interesting
and "brave" to just participate somewhere where one assumes the otherwise
encompassing legal protocols of 18th century print culture don't apply? I
mean, we've got intelligent people-poet-pets publicly groping their virtual
members with soft poetry-porn these past few days, demonstrating, on the
male side, at least, that high school clique testoreronementality operates
in CAnada just like in U.S. (big surprise, original canada!). This will
become part of the permanent record. ON what basis would they demand that
their sad silliness should not be quoted for the record? Don't get me wrong,
I find it very funny, and thus am grateful-- but shouldn't EVERYONE IN THE

This is where a question comes up-- why are Brian Kim Stefans's posts any
more intrinsically beyond free quoting than the come-covered urn pieces of a
middle aged and/or geriatric horny foursome? ONe man's or woman's silliness
is another's thrilling bricolage, I propose, and long live the union of
poetry and it's weird seepages, wherever thaey may seep.

I say, Brian, let's leave poetry and poetics out of the real estate
business.

As long as people like you believe that the CONSTITUTION is a precursor to
Marx and the left wing fascism of Hillary Clinton, there will be a right
wing currently led by Rush Limbaugh and before him William Buckley.  Since
when does the SDS and their descendents own poetry?  What you call a
distressing development is a sign that someone's HEART is beating. I go with
Camille Paglia against whatever it is you want to do to the rest of us.

I think Kent is right to feel nervous about being misunderstood.  Given the
hostility manifest in the first 3 quotes from his post, it would be all too
easy to get him wrong, and assume he hated the persons who brought him such
merriment.

Indeed I was surprised by the fourth quote, but I see now that is only
because Kent has a unique way of expressing gratitude. Being jester at the
court of King Kent would be very much like being succesful suitor at the
court of Queen Praying Mantis.

I imagine a Kent Johnson review of the Marx Bros :

"This contemptible quartet kept me in stitches for hours. How sad it is to
see four men in their forties acting like disturbed adolescents! The tears
streamed down my cheeks, tears of laughter that is. That the one with the
wooliest head of hair should assume there is anything funny about being
struck dumb and driven to have recourse in a motor-horn scrapes the bottom
of the humor barrel, and I fell out of my chair whenever he appeared. There
is little more hateful, more deserving of the scornful censure of all
really red-blooded, mature-thinking and -acting individuals among us
american culture-critics, than humor based on questions of reference---as
if the merest child wasnt aware of the upsets that can occur where sound
and letters get caught in a contradiction. When one of them said "You cant
fool me, there aint no Sanity Clause, " I shrieked aloud with gratitude.
And how puerile of that one to pretend to be an Italian. We all know he is
a Jew. Adopting the stereotypical broken English of a recent arrival from
Napoli -- can there be any cheaper way of getting a laugh? My readers may
rest assured that I guffawed along with the rest. But I have the last
laugh, because I had snuck in without paying. Damned if I would support in
any way shape or form such disgraceful entertainment! Why, the one with the
cigar, the one whose gait appears to mock persons afflicted in their
stride, the one with an sadly advanced case of satyriasis, the one whose
every calculation is to defraud his fellow-man,this so-called "Groucho" had
the bad taste to impersonate the President not only of a college (in a
movie that mocks two of our greatest minds, Huxley and Darwin, by naming
inferior schools after them)  but the President of a republic with the
stirring name of Fredonia. How can a grown man run around in front of a
movie camera with a charcoal mustache and eyebrows doing all possible to
destroy faith in our institutions, and not bring the house down? I laughed
so hard that I had no voice left to make my usual requests of the
dominatrix I repair to after I have brought disrepute upon the Johnson name
by laughing uncontrollably in public. "

All right. I have to, for the thousandth time, declare and admit that
my buffoonery in things literary has been upbraided and corrected by
my old mentor Bromige. I am, as always, though my tears fall down my
cheeks and ensalten my lips, grateful for yet another correction. If
it had not been for Bromige, far more than Keats, say, I would still
be trying to write quatrains in the fashion of Granville Rice. As
always, thanks, roshi, and please do not despair of my eventual
enlightenment. In Orono I will carry your briefcase. I will threaten
the waiter and get you a good table near the fireplace. I will listen
to you read passages from Red Hats without tiring. I will explain to
Maria
Daemon your many good qualities. I will reread all of Keats's oweds.

 Who is "you" and what does she presumably want
to do to the rest of "us"?

?

I am trying to figure out whose post actually inspired
this diatribe but I can't, because it seems to bundle all
of the female respondents so far into one homogenous
group and oppose them to Camille Paglia.  Which
doesn't sound like the writer paid much attention
to what was actually said.  So if we're going to air
knee-jerk opinions, well--I usually find the wanna-be
hipper-than-hip rebel Paglia poses to be silly.  Also
irresponsible:  an easy justification for copping a
way out of actually dealing with social issues.  But I
am probably failing to give Paglia enough credit.
For example, she has found a way to earn a lot of
money from writing books and giving lectures at
large universities.  Good for her.

Okay, this was not directed at me, but since I responded to Catherine Daly's
info-post on femmesoul that got this whole thing started, I thought I'd chime
in again.  I'm more than a little worried about the good ole USA.  It seems
we're awash in fascists!  Right wing fascists!  Left wing fascists!  Soup
nazis!  Even Charles Bernstein has been called a fascist.  Look, Mussolini
was a fascist.  Hillary Clinton, Rush Limbaugh and Charles Bernstein are
likely not fascists.  Has anyone lately looked up the word "fascism" in that
fascist tome, Webster's Dictionary?   Fascism is defined as "rigid one party
dictatorship" that forcibly suppresses opposition such as unions and "other, e
specially leftist, parties, minority groups, etc."   Fascism is by definition
is right wing, but not every right winger is a fascist.   As for the left,
maybe Hillary is an opportunist (really?!!?  a lawyer/politician who's an
opportunist?!!?) who has a soft spot for socialism--so did FDR and everyone
else who helped provide us with social security, unemployment insurance,
Medicare, the dole, etc.--but socialism is not fascism!  Maybe Rush is
laissez faire; maybe (since he once worked in baseball) he prefers a life of
endless, World Series competition; maybe he can't formulate a world more
complicated than a double play; maybe his heart is as shrunken as his new
weight watchers body--but that doesn't qualify him as a fascist.  Maybe
Bernstein fancies himself a neo-modernist--but fascism defines political
views, not aesthetic ones.  Those modernists (e.g., the Italian Futurists)
were fascists because they supported Mussolini, not because of their poetic
styles and tastes.  Now if Bernstein were to, say, forcibly ban certain points
 of view from the Poetics List, that might qualify.  I guess dillon@icube.com
would be the first to go.  But here s/he is, uncensored.  And I must say
that, her hyper-realism aside, Camille Paglia isn't completely crazy; she's
1960s crazy which is often crazy like a fox.  Can we at least make a
beginning at using correct terminology?  As long as s/he isn't directing a
military coup, or at least proposing it, let's refer to someone we disagree
with as the tried and true "you silly."  I know, this is America.  If a few
of us really insist on the hyperemotional erasure of the sensible, that's
their right.  And anyone who doesn't agree with me gets a soldier in the
house, pointing a gun at the closet--the fascist wardrobe police.  Peace and
love, guys, or at least valium for those who need it.

Having read Joe Safdie's original post (& Rachel Levitsky's post, which it
was in response to), I have no idea what Richard Dillon is talking about.  I
thought Joe was bemoaning what appeared to be Rachel's suggestion that
"pro-sex" meant right-wing.  (Knowing Rachel, I assume that's not what she
meant, but I'll leave it to her to clear that up).

Now, being one of those "people like" Joe, I also think it would be sad if
being "pro-sex" were suddenly the exclusive domain of the right.
(Fortunately, it's not).  The right, on the other hand, seems quite content
to identify sex with liberals, if not the left, so they can demonize the
Clintons, gays, & anybody else they don't like.

When did anyone, on this list or anywhere else, say that the Constitution is
a precursor to Marx?  What, if it could be established that there is someone
on earth who thinks that, does that have to do with this thread?

You're right that nobody owns poetry, Mr. Dillon.  But does it come as a
shock to you that a lot of people drawn to the range of poetics discussed on
this list don't demonize Marx the way you seem to?  Nor is a progressive or
leftist bent among most poets a particularly recent historical development.
If your politics are different, okay-- I assume you wouldn't find any more
broad agreement on this list about politics than you would about poetics.
However, I also assume you're here to talk about the issues constructively,
rather than to make broad, ill-informed generalizations in the manner of
that "leader" of the right (and radio personality) Rush Limbaugh.

D incorrectly assumes me to mean that I am laughing _along_ with him and M

are different kinds of funny. But D, letter jacket-wearing earnest master of

But I know my sense of humor (which on more than this occasion has sent D

All in all, I guess D's post makes it clear that I won't be welcomed in

The Poetry Project is proud to announce

our new web site design by

the wonderful and marvelous John Coletti & Edwin Torres

who worked many, many hard hours to revamp our web site.

please check it out

at

http://www.poetryproject.com


while the content is much the same (and please forgive

broken links or anything like that--we just put the new

web site up yesterday and are still working out the kinks)

navigation will be easier and we love the

new look, with photographs of St. Mark's Church

by wonder photographer and poet Greg Fuchs.

So, enjoy!


Forthcoming in July, the next issue

of Poets & Poems, with work by

Dgls Rthschjld, Jean Donnelly, Chris

McCreary, and more!

And the Tiny Press Center is being

updated--new entries are in as we speak...

***

Next week: announcements of summer poetry events,

such as the Boston Conference, a reading in Easton, Pennsylvania, etc.....

Actually, Limbaugh IS a fascist.  Please refer to page 137 of the AP
Stylebook under "Limbaugh, Rush" or even most post-1994 dictionaries in the
english language under "fascist."  Please note that most copies of the AP
Stylebooks published in the last 5 years are missing page 137, as they were
removed by the TimeWarner/AOL corporation.

Okay, this was not directed at me, but since I responded to Catherine Daly's
info-post on femmesoul that got this whole thing started, I thought I'd
chime
in again.  I'm more than a little worried about the good ole USA.  It seems
we're awash in fascists!  Right wing fascists!  Left wing fascists!  Soup
nazis!  Even Charles Bernstein has been called a fascist.  Look, Mussolini
was a fascist.  Hillary Clinton, Rush Limbaugh and Charles Bernstein are
likely not fascists.  Has anyone lately looked up the word "fascism" in that
fascist tome, Webster's Dictionary?   Fascism is defined as "rigid one party
dictatorship" that forcibly suppresses opposition such as unions and "other,
e
specially leftist, parties, minority groups, etc."   Fascism is by
definition
is right wing, but not every right winger is a fascist.   As for the left,
maybe Hillary is an opportunist (really?!!?  a lawyer/politician who's an
opportunist?!!?) who has a soft spot for socialism--so did FDR and everyone
else who helped provide us with social security, unemployment insurance,
Medicare, the dole, etc.--but socialism is not fascism!  Maybe Rush is
laissez faire; maybe (since he once worked in baseball) he prefers a life of
endless, World Series competition; maybe he can't formulate a world more
complicated than a double play; maybe his heart is as shrunken as his new
weight watchers body--but that doesn't qualify him as a fascist.  Maybe
Bernstein fancies himself a neo-modernist--but fascism defines political
views, not aesthetic ones.  Those modernists (e.g., the Italian Futurists)
were fascists because they supported Mussolini, not because of their poetic
styles and tastes.  Now if Bernstein were to, say, forcibly ban certain
points
 of view from the Poetics List, that might qualify.  I guess
dillon@icube.com
would be the first to go.  But here s/he is, uncensored.  And I must say
that, her hyper-realism aside, Camille Paglia isn't completely crazy; she's
1960s crazy which is often crazy like a fox.  Can we at least make a
beginning at using correct terminology?  As long as s/he isn't directing a
military coup, or at least proposing it, let's refer to someone we disagree
with as the tried and true "you silly."  I know, this is America.  If a few
of us really insist on the hyperemotional erasure of the sensible, that's
their right.  And anyone who doesn't agree with me gets a soldier in the
house, pointing a gun at the closet--the fascist wardrobe police.  Peace and
love, guys, or at least valium for those who need it.

an e-lynching because a guy is a cynical bastard?  nudel's cynicism is so
large it is worthy of poetry, sorry to say.  so he poked at poets.  i rather
like laughing at myself and found him funny.  even if his methods can be
considered crude.   reading his posts was for me like watching "Henry Fool,"
that funny/not-funny simultaneous experience of being made to bear witness
to the contradictions and myth-sized naiveté of literature and writers and
the literary world as a whole, the experience of seeing myself as part of
that which is being criticized, and how such an experience makes me desire
to become a bit better than the object of the parody.

but someone here crossed a line when they went delving into Nudel's business
over some comments about poetry as a business.  i love baraka, and i felt
nudel's comments were tinged with anger (happy writers are boring and too
cute anyway), so I did not agree with the flavor of Nudel's words in this
respect.  but hell, why try to draw and quarter Nudel with _ad hominem_
viciousness and other displays of politically-aligned weakness?  anger is
ok, difference of opinion is ok, but i think telling the guy to "fuck off"
publicly is pretty weak.  though i do like the way it was said, '$uck $ou.'
that is cute.

nudel says:

poetry is
business
politics
sex
solipsism
self
ocd

well these might be strong, in the sense that nudel might equate poetry with
each of these, but if the "is" part is weakened (and i think he does that by
the sheer number of items on the right side of his verbal equation), how can
one really argue with ANY of these things?  poetry does partake of all of
these things; it is hardly some pure state of being free from the uglies of
the world (though i wouldn't include 'sex' in my list of uglies).  i might
not agree with everything nudel says but his words are welcome even when
misguided; i do not welcome 'fuck you' or an unwelcome and poorly
constructed capital analysis of the guy's way of making a buck.  that's
pretty cheap and childish, i have to say.

i have often maintained that one of the reasons this list has consistently
irked me is because it seems at times worse than the television or the front
section of the NYT, 70% ads, or 'publi$$$$ity' as Nudel puts it.  I stay on
this list because there are some people on this list that have something to
add to poetics and poetry other than announcements for their new books or
readings or new journals or other mercantile-poetic efforts.  At least Nudel
doesn't advertise his books here.

Subject: "Pacific Postmodern" chapbook from Tinfish

Dear 'poetics list' members: Susan Schultz, devoted editor of Tinfish as
you know, a cultural-political & savy small-press journal of "experimental
writing across the Pacific," has just printed a devious little chapbook of
mine called:

Rob Wilson, "Pacific Postmodern:  From the Sublime to the Devious,
Writing the Experimental/Local Pacific in Hawai'i," 200 copies, designed
by K.C. Mah, ISBN: 1-930068-04-2.  Cost:  $5.00.

Amazon.com will stock it soon, or you can order it directly from: Susan
Schultz, Tinfish, 47-391 Hui Iwa #3, Kaneohe, Hawai'i 96744 USA.
email:  sschultz@hawaii.edu

Or order it from authorial me:  Rob Wilson, Dept. of English, U of Hawai'i
at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawai'i 96822 USA.

The chapbook, in a thick descriptive way, concerns articulating "two
postmodernisms": one that would become deracinated and tied to a
problematics of infinite and regressive deconstruction and word play; and
another more 'postcolonial' brand of experimental postmodernism that would
remain affliated to place, locality, identity, nation, decolonizing
struggle, and resistance to global capitalism in its many ruses. I round
up a cast of innovative writers from in and around the Pacific and deal
thereby with issues of white mythology, tourist simulation of location,
indigenous and ethnic tensions, semiotics of place, posturing the
indigenous and poetic inauthenticity, US imperialism and its resistances,
all the while advocating for the emergence of a "mongrel poetics," and the
blessings of mongrelhood existence in some community of globalized local
work zones.

There was a thread a while back on regionality/experimental writing-- it
is exactly on that issue from s/pacific angles of vision.

If you need or want to know more, please email me directly.  Rob Wilson

PS. I do have a 312 page book coming out this month with Duke UP called
"Reimagining the American Pacific: From 'South Pacific' to Bamboo Ridge
and Beyond" but this chapbook is in some ways better,'new and improved,'
less costly, and a more innovative supplement to anything I have ever said
about such matters before (but don't tell that to Duke editors).

And here is to writing some more 'clear and simple prose' of the most
devious sort! May Denis Dutton blather, fume, sulk, and babble over its
syntax, while he plays Glenn Gould in Christchurch sanctuary far from
the Maori struggle. Me, I will be reading Gramsci and listening to Empire
Burlesque and Infidels.

Perhaps, Kent, while it may be your democratic right to entertain the turbid
fantasies about listees which you uncovered in your previous post, their
interest, as well as your sense of humour, may be more idiosyncratic than
you imagine.

Sounds great, Steve Shoemaker. But exactly what do you mean by "young?"
Do you mean it in the sense of "experimental types" that are "younger than
Springtime?"
Or do you mean young ones as in "They tried to tell us we're too young."

I myself have always held that "Youth is wasted on the Jung."

Anyway, just joking, but my suggestion is you immediately order the soon to
be released mega-anthology of 23 essays on just this topic,  coming from
the the University of Alabama Press, edited by listee Mark Wallace.Asked
"Who is in it?" the anthologist answered simply "Who isn't?"

Just inquire further herein.

All the best,
Nick Piombino

Being "pro-sex" sounds to me a little bit like being
"pro-poetry": better than being anti-poetry, but not
much.

I'm reminded of Germaine Greer's statement, "No sex is
better than bad sex", which I think was meant to be
trenchant but actually sounds like a Woody Allen
quip...

It all depends, K. If you knock in the spirit of a nark, not welcome. If
you knock in the spirit of a party-pooper, forget it.  If you come as a
Malvolio, go rub your chain with breadcrumbs. But if you knock as someone
willing to enter into the spirit of a roast --which is the comic relief we
four would actually provide; dont get led astray by the handy language game
of open-heart psychobabble and talk-dirty flirting ---come on in and be
roasted.


Btw, K, whats all this geriatric stuff, are you age-ist? Is it worse when
people older than K, talk dirty?  Hmm, is it like being forced into
imagining your parents doing it? ---I think it's too bad they dont use
older people in pornography more often. Their intercourse lasts a lot
longer and there arent any of those interruptions to witness the male
orgasm.  In that respect, let's note that there wasnt any cum on the urn
until you put it there. To play a game, it is necessary to know where to
draw the line.


In a parallel development, thanks G for the offer, but you havent seen the
size of my briefcase have you?

Also, you should know that I now keep my money in a money belt.

All--Thanks for your suggestions so far regarding the proposed poetics
anthology.  I shld probably further clarify that 1) the essays must be
written by poets, 2) they shld be general statements on poetics, not
essays about particular writers, and 3) the anthology is limited to U.S.
Americans.  And hey, don't shoot me, I'm just a messenger.  I've got no
control over the project except that i'm angling to get some cool stuff
included under the terms that have already been set.  My tongue was in
my cheek when i asked for "nominations for canonical status," i'm aware
of the pitfalls of this sort of canon-building, etc etc   best, s

Doesn't
sex, like probably almost everything else, now find definitive place in the
end-time manoevers of, let's call them the Knights Templar and the Knights
of Malta rather than liberal and conservative.  Maltese sex means progeny in
the sense of sheer numbers, like, of voters (if you will), or, to be less
optimistic, armies.  Templar sex has to do with the neurological, magical
and/or supernatural effects of time-factored Red Woman practices and
endocrinal secretions, ie., raising a cone of power rather than children.
The Templar side is pure

Army/Air Force Mickey Mantle Sears Roebuck materialism, whereas the Maltese
is OSS/CIA/Navy Roger Maris Montgomery Ward idealism.  The Temps are
white-lodge (protestant) Masons; the Malts are black-lodgers on the
Rome/Berlin neo-fascist axis (mafia, the Vatican).  But where does that
leave (or put) Sex?  Sex is about

power, among other things; it infuses every category, indivisibly.  It can
be politicized in any direction, as it goes public.  So in order to
comprehend the public celebration, condemnation - not to say Use - of sex,
one might usefully look at those who maintain and accrue power, and to
events where private enterprise intersects or collides with the public eye.
Those recent fires in and around Los Alamos, for instance,

wch provided opportunity for an interview w/ a local woman who claimed she
had dug an ET out of her backyard, and it was her theory (therefore) that
the Los Alamos fires had been "set" in order to burn away all the other
remaining ETs.  But what about the idea that the fires had been "set" in an
attempt to melt down the computer files that were the primary evidence of
deals having gone down with the Chinese?
But this is Weekly World News stuff,

especially in that names aren't named.  Who did what for who, and why.  The
"hows" are everywhere, like another manual for Manual Sex.  It isn't that
sex is liberal or conservative or Maltese or Templar particularly, but the
fact of manipulation, who IS pulling the monkey wires, the puppet strings?
Outside the theoretical,

you've got the likes of certain Orthodox rabbis in Israel, for example, who
have hired this American calf breeding expert Clyde Lott, to produce a
perfectly red calf in order for them to have the appropriate sign that a
biblical prophesy has in fact come true.  So,

heads up, poets.  The order of the proper manifestation of "signs" is
presumed to be known.  Their production is increasingly being put in the
hands (and labs) of Big Science.  Legal systems and distribution and
education networks are tightening up and locking out alternative
interpretations.  Sex, at this point anymore, has no wings - they've been
pulled off.  Time to button up and batten down, or unbutton, bid it up and
do the diddy-wah, as if anyone knew the difference.  Or not "time", really,
to do anything except not play the fool - while playing him completely, to
the hilt.  No big difference there.

Thank you George Bowering for the tip re Kevin Davies' latest book, _Comp_
. He's one of my favorite reads so I look forward to this one.

I want to recommend a new book by another young Canadian. Well, to me
anyone under 59 is young, but Mr W-H is squarely GenX, I believe. His book
is very hip. You recall that Bernadette Mayer list of exercises to start
one writing? This poem, book-length, 50 5 x 6 inch pages, densely filled,
begins where that list leaves off, but to a much different effect : the
quick profusion of suggestions,  as they accumulate, by equating such
various notions of text generation, slams doors shut rather than opening
them. Or that is one effect. We are sitting here stranded, and the irony of
W-H's feverish castings-about means that he, for one, is doing his best
_not_ to deny it.

At the same time, however, the brilliance of the wit of reference, the
manifold eruptions of invention, restore my faith in the poetic act. Here's
a sample :

"escape from a paragraph by eloping along bottomless discourses andor point
out that super mario world is actually a complex digital allegory for the
writings of terence mckenna andor pen a treatise for andre breton and
philippe soupault in which you discuss the magnetic fields emitted by each
vowel when it attracts the surrounding consonants like iron filings and
then note that sometimes the letter y emanates a magnetism of its own andor
proceed according to a philosophy of whatever andor insert chapbooks into
the newspapers sold in vending boxes on the street andor do it even more
than usual andor learn everything that you can about the life of cervantes
and then rewrite don quixote from the viewpoint of the windmills andor
print a set of instructions for dry cleaning the sacred shroud of turin
andor fill a red wheelbarrow to the brim with depends brand adult
undergarments and then entitle it doctor williams in his dotage andor
compose a poem about the late john cage by writing sixtyfour hexasticha
based on the chinese book of changes andor move them in or out of space
andor design a camera that records its own presence in the photo andor
construe a word by word synonymic replacement for finnegans wake and then
dedicate the new book to casey from mr dressup andor look as little like a
particular point of view as possible andor compose a love poem called
charged particles in which each line consists of a single word ending in
the suffix ion andor stick a stamp on your forehead and then pull a mailbag
over your eyes before you begin to recite andor work on a poem attempting
to emulate gansers syndrome wherein a person responds to emotionally
difficult questions with evasive answers andor address the united nations
with your intentions andor write an encyclopedic novel about a whale but
maintain throughout that the whale is a fish not a mammal andor write a
series of haiku about barrett watten and bruce andrews and lyn hejinian but
sign it using the pseudonym lang po andor remove specificities and then
convert to ambiguities "

Reading further, we encounter other familiar names, e.g.

"andor document your participation in an illegal activity and then render
the document nearly but only nearly illegible through the apllication of
artistic means before you show the document to the cops andor write so as
to make a hollow andor cover a refrigerator with fridge magnets that spell
out poems from the food section of tender buttons by gertrude stein and
then fill the contents of the fridge with the corresponding comestibles
andor humanize the parts that are free of error andor write poems that
consist of nothing but punctuation marks andor prove what george bowering
says about lyric poems by lugging a beercooler containing twentysix
snowballs into the middle of the tunisian desert and then put a snowball
outside the door to your tent every morning at seven andor keep changing
andor carve it in intaglio onto the surface of a tenpin bowling ball and
then ink the ball and then throw it down the lane all the while running
behind in order to read the text imprinted onto the floor awarding yourself
extra points for a strike spare or coherent sentence andor imagine george
clinton in the white house"


_the tapeworm foundry_ , a book in its design handy and attractive, is
available from  House of Anansi Press Ltd, 34 Lesmill Road, Toronto,
Ontario, M3B 2T6 .
Their phone # is 416 445 3333 . The book retails for CAN$ 14.95 (about
$1.29 in US money).

Kent J.,

You seem an odd one to get your kimono in a bunch over acts of literary
buffoonery--

In a poem called "Telescope with Urn," Yasusada wrote: "The image of the
galaxies spreads-out like a cloud of sperm." Now you've spread sperm on
_Keats'_ urn. Is there some connection?

Yasusada wrote: "Here the young are speaking of virility and all the
hidden forms." But apparently the "middle aged and/or geriatric" are to
stay hidden while the young speak.

Yasusada wrote: "The voices of the sorority girls sing of fucking in a
plaintive way." Perhaps he meant: it is like the idea of a nymphet,
opening within the idea of a nymphet. The sorority girls I know sing
about beer, briefs v boxers and bulimia. But speak softly, Buffy, and
carry a big lollipop, because the customer is always right

And who said the unexamined life isn't worth living?

Younger than springtime,
Suzy C.

P.S. Thanks for the bitchen poems.

Green Integer is proud to announce two new titles, now
available:

3 MASTERPIECES OF CUBAN DRAMA: PLAYS BY JULIO MATAS, CARLOS FELIPE, AND
VIRGILIO PINERA, Translated, edited and with an Introduction by
Luis F. Gonzalez-Cruz and Ann Waggoner Aken

Beginning in the 1930s and continuing through the 1950s, a succession
of dramatic groups appeared in Havana, introducing select Cuban
audiences to the artistic trends that had been revolutionizing the
European stage since the turn of the Twentieth Century. From this
dynamic theater movement emerged several first-rate playwrights,
among whom stand out Julio Matas, Carlos Felipe and Virgilio Pinera,
included here. As a director, Matas was the first to stage Eugene
Ionesco's theater in Havana. Matas's play "El extravio" had its
premiere, in both Spanish and English, in Miami in 1993, and was
later presented in Costa Rica as part of the annual Festival of
the Arts. Felipe's "The Chinaman" was written in 1947, and was staged
in Havana that same year. It was awarded first prize of the competition
sponsored by the Academia de Artes Dramaticas. The third play, "An
Empty Shoebox," by renowened Cuban writer Virgilio Pinera, was written
in 1968 and was sent clandestinely by the author to Luis Gonzalez-Cruz,
who published an annotated edition of the play in Spanish in 1986.
Together, these plays represent some of the most outstanding and
broad-ranging theater traditions in Cuba before and after the
Revolution. Green Integer 70, $12.95 (264 pages)


RECTIFICATION OF EROS, by Sam Eisenstein

"Change is a state of mind and the [author] Sam Eisenstein knows
this territory well. Sometimes everything changes while nothing
happens," wrote the NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW of THE INNER GARDEN.
In his baffling, playful, and erotic new fiction, transformation
is the key to all possibilities. Joe and his Labrador retriever,
Jezebel, secretly ship themselves to Havana, hoping to start anew
while escaping one of Joe's old girlfriends. Against the lush,
tropical backgroud of an imagined Cuba, in which Fidel Castro
himself plays a major role, all hell breaks loose as Joe and Jezabel
come to play a major role in the battle against world domination by
the crafty, murderous Cat Women. Author of THE INNER GARDEN and
PRICE OF ADMISSION, Los Angeles writer Eisenstein lets loose his
imagination in this marvelously unusual novel.  Green Integer 74,
$10.95  (352 pages)

These two titles are availalbe to friends of Green Integer at a
20% discount. Please send checks for $10.36 + $1.25 for shipping
for 3 CUBAN MASTERPIECES and $8.76 plus $1.25 for RECTIFICATION

I'm looking forward to Defib this Sunday with Jack Kimball of
www.theeastvillage.com . He's put together some quality "volumes" of poetry
there. And we'll also have a look at some graphical works of his. It'll be
interesting to talk about poetry and the Web with Jack.

Defib will happen Sunday at 13:00 PST. Point your browser at
http://webartery.com and click "Defib".

no doubt.

Hope to see you there.

COLLECTED NOT SPEWED, a reverse reading of synthetic poetry, featuring the
work of Elana Abernathy, Humera Afridi, Joe Ahearn, Ray Bianchi, Brian
Clements, Ilex Fenusova, Michael Puttonen, John Richards, and Kristin
Ryling, will be held June 28, 7:51 PM, at the McKinney Avenue Contemporary
in Dallas.

This is a "reverse" reading since, rather than the poets standing up and
reading their work, the work will be posted on the walls and the audience
will be free to roam from poem to poem and read what they want. Note also
that rather than paying to get in, the audience will be paid for coming!

Free t-shirts will be given away and a toaster oven will be raffled.

Synthetic poetry is a new method and style of poetry writing which should
be almost completely dead by Wednesday, June 28 at 7:51 p.m.

I am going to explain something to you in the near future that may seem to
be said in vain
but regardless I am going to go ahead and say it.  Don't worry, it isn't a
criticism of you.
It, this explanation, is about the word, "emotion."  Okay?  Thanks.
Remember - soon.

Since I have no idea where people are getting these wild notions or why my
irony is so missed by a poetic audience let me just say that yes, I was
referring to femmesoul.com specifically--which is what I thought we were
speaking about.  When I referred to fascists, I was referring to futurists
who were actually a part of a movement called fascism.
Pro-sex is a term that was politicized by feminist lesbians in the early
1990's (so far as I know)  that is why I found it amusing to come upon this
right wing ultra straight website that was putting forth this brash pro-sex
(their version of sex) writing.
No more explaining for a while.

-----------------

Handwritten Press is pleased to announce the publication of our fourth book,
_Windore_, by Aaron D. Levy.  This work - a brief study of darkness and
light - makes use of Levy's early photographic study of the window, as well
as his textual figuring of memory.  As he suggests in the introductory
interview, the window allows for a certain re-imagining of the space between
the self and the outside world, so fluid at times as to constitute solidity.
He writes: "I would ask that everything remain the same in the window,
albeit a little difference - all this piles up, making inane the possibility
of conceptualizing a medium so pliable as to often allow ourselves to
forget
it."

Aaron Levy is currently Resident Junior Fellow, Kelly Writers House,
University of Pennsylvania.  He is currently an editor of "Other Voices",
an (e)journal of cultural criticism, co-organizer of the lecture series
"Theorizing in Particular," and coordinator and archivist of "Phillytalks,"
a lecture series on contemporary experimental poetry.  Recent exhibits
include "ex.02.plastics," a photography exhibit at Fox Gallery, University
of Pennsylvania, "notes towards flight" at the Kelly Writers House, and
"artsEdge," the digital blueprint for a community arts initiative in the
Faculty 2000 Architecture Exhibit, University of Pennsylvania.  His visual
work has been featured in publications such as CrossConnect; his writings in
publications such as the upcoming issue of Chain.

40 pp., 8.5" x 8.5", leatherette cover, images printed on transparency, bolt
& washer binding.  $15.00

Copies of _Windore_ can be ordered through Small Press Distribution
(http://www.spdbooks.org).

Best,
Kristen Gallagher, editor

Writing Class: The Kootenay School of Writing Anthology, edited by Andrew
Klobucar and Michael Barnholden (New Star Books)

For fifteen years the Kootenay School of Writing has been an important
cultural force in the poetries of Canada and the US, and Writing Class, a
long-awaited anthology, presents the work of many of the writers who have
contributed to its success.   The poetics of the KSW continue to exert an
indelible force across the conventional pieties of US-based "workshop"
poetry.  Like Small Press Traffic, the Kootenay School enacts an ideal
model of an artists-run organization with a social, political and aesthetic
agenda.  The collective as anti-institution.  With the help of the Canada
Council, the editors Andrew Klobucar and Michael Barnholden, the publisher
Rolf Maurer, and the poets Lisa Robertson and Peter Culley will appear on
our stage to discuss the School, the book and read from some of the work.

Qasida of Qiwami


When all at last could render and infer, Jennifer would last and call her

before her fall, Then Jennifer went her Qasida:

You will be nothing but a name. The hard pebble of your name. Your flesh
will disappear. Not even a Qasida of your name. Only your name will re-
main. There will be nothing but this name. This name will be all there is.
There will be no sign of the signified. There will only be this sequence
of letters. It will not be beside the torn flesh or broken bones. It will
not be beside the dust of the jeweled skull. It will be nowhere around the
sceptre. It will have nothing to do with the glinting sword. It will not
be connected in any way to the curved jewels. It will have no relation to
the conch shell trumpet or the dorje. It will not be of pure flame or the
vajra. It will not exist or reference a stupa or glittering city of marble
towers. The name which remains will be connected to no one. No thing will
resonate with the appearance of the name. There will be no shakti or sutra
but only this name. This name will be buried under mountains and boulders
but this name will be buried beneath seas and rivers. But only this name,
but not even a Qasida of the name.

Okay.  I'll respond apropos Rush, Paglia and all the rest.  But, not at this
moment. (I'm in the midst of acquiring some shares in Celera and afterwards
have an appointment in town with clients.)  Later tonight.

Philip (& others looking for Irish poetry),

Any of the titles published by Wild Honey Press or hardPressed Poetry
will be of interest -- they publish the most interesting and innovative
Irish poetry.  You can get a distribution list of available titles by
writing to Billy Mills at

bmills@netg.ie

Trevor Joyce maintains a web site devoted to innovative Irish poetry.
The URL is:

http://indigo.ie/~tjac/sound_eye_hme.htm


read.me magazine #1 features an interview I did with Randolph Healy, one
of the best Irish poets.  At the end there's a bibliography listing
articles on Healy and others.

http://www.jps.net/nada/healy.htm

The only thing I'd add to the bibliography is Samizdat #4 (available
from yours truly) which includes an essay by Billy Mills on the
publishing of innovative poetry in Ireland.

Best,

Robert Archambeau

Beyond the good sex, bad sex, anti-sex and pro-sex theses of the likes of
the Mitford girls, the Stepford wives and/or Apollo's nine, there's always
pata-sex: the total copulation of mindlessness, bodilessness and
selflessness, that produces a grand opening that no single argument can
fill.  Think of it this way - the world as one gigantic Wet Spot.  No
rolling out of the way of This one.

Kent J.,

You seem an odd one to get your kimono in a bunch over acts of literary
buffoonery--

In a poem called "Telescope with Urn," Yasusada wrote: "The image of the
galaxies spreads-out like a cloud of sperm." Now you've spread sperm on
_Keats'_ urn. Is there some connection?

Yasusada wrote: "Here the young are speaking of virility and all the
hidden forms." But apparently the "middle aged and/or geriatric" are to
stay hidden while the young speak.

Yasusada wrote: "The voices of the sorority girls sing of fucking in a
plaintive way." Perhaps he meant: it is like the idea of a nymphet,
opening within the idea of a nymphet. The sorority girls I know sing
about beer, briefs v boxers and bulimia. But speak softly, Buffy, and
carry a big lollipop, because the customer is always right

And who said the unexamined life isn't worth living?

Younger than springtime,
Suzy C.

P.S. Thanks for the bitchen poems.

while i'm felling typy,

i second this book. i've heard darren read from it twice and it is
amazing. funny and telling.

i know not much of an endorsment but after reading a review of John
Kinsella's book on this list to be (maybe already) published by some sort
of Harvard organ, I have to make a distiction between American and
Canadian writing. The review lumps together all North American writing in
english. I'll find it in my mail boxes- i have just moved and haven't yet
unpacked. I recommend having a read of David Bomige's introduction to East
Village # 4 http://www.TheEastVillage.com/vc.htm

as to what Canadian poets are up to.

on this note. i'd love a review of Peter Jaeger's reading to appear on
this list.

ok.

Today (21st June) is the tenth anniversary of the death of poet Martin
Johnston, who spent his youth in England and Greece, and his adult life in
Australia and Europe.

A broad sampling of essays and reminscences about Martin as well as many of
Martin's poems, translations of Greek folk songs, and essays are available
in Jacket magazine, both in

Jacket # 1      http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket01/index01.html

        and in

Jacket # 11     http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket11/index.html

I'd like to offer for the consideration of the list these two fragments of
poems by Seferis which Martin translated.

When will you speak again?
Our words are many men's children.
They're sown they're born like children
they take root they feed on blood.
As pine trees hold the wind's form
after the wind's gone, is no longer there,
so words preserve man's form
and he's gone, he's no longer there.
        - George Seferis, "On Stage", trans. Martin Johnston

We knew that the islands were beautiful, somewhere
aroundabout here where we were searching:
a little nearer or a little further:
the slightest distance.
        - George Seferis, "Mythical Story", trans. Martin Johnston

Apologies for cross-posting.

Philip:

I'd rec. BITTER HARVEST, An Anthology Of Contemporary Irish Verse,Selected
and Introduced by John Montague (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1989).

It runs the length from Coffey (who gives Bunting a run for his money) to
Sara Berkeley, who can powder the lust of a sharp line.

The established and the young guns can be found here.

Best,

Philip,

Bob Archambeau's references are very good.  The essay by Billy Mills is a
useful corrective to some misimpressions I gave about Irish poetry
publishing in a review of some Wild Honey titles in Samizadat #3.  I still
like my specific comments on the Wild Honey titles, however, and you might
want to read that review to get an impression Healy, Trevor Joyce, Billy
Mills, Pete Smith, and honorary Irish poet Bob Archambeau.

Bob, I apologize for not returning your call.  I've been swamped.  I'll
try to call tomorrow.

Cheers,
David

The Telling Quote


"Sexualities, issues of dreamed bodies and bodies dreaming, trance-states,
philosophies of the future - the textual body and the body of text - the
scanned body - mired, abject - dirty filthy body - down _there_ - the
whole falling plaster. I learn this body is bound. I learn about writing
through at it di dah bi bi bi dah bah. It looks like a bodily organ bah of
dessicated bodies. A huge, maw, opened, arched, empty beneath, of dessic-
ated bodies, the shape of it. Or somebody working. I am always working on
me. It rain. I do not know, nobody knows. There are torrents inside me.
They nuance my body; I said it was hard to explain - as if surgery were
of no interest in explaining myself. The Bodhisattva helps - that is a
space to remember. I assemble this quote. I attribute it to Jennifer-Julu.
I say HELO body. I say RCPT. I say MESG. I say DATA," says Jennifer-Julu.

cannot imagine; I am one of your dreamers, caught in the skein of worlds.
Every loss loosens the vault of heavens; every illness screams my name
into voids. Bodhisattva, help me. Nikuko, destroy me, liberate me, starve
me until my clothes fall into chasms, my skin floats free in unspeakable
skies.  Hello old friend, said Nikuko in the Julu run-time program. It's
been a long time. I don't sleep too well at night; I'm always troubled by
dreams. The worlds I have created - they haunt me. Samsara and repetition
bedevil my creations. I hurry on to another. I never stay, never write a
book until the end. Um ma am um!

Cauldron & Net, an electronic magazine of the arts and new media, is
currently reading/viewing submissions for vol.II, no.II [from may 1 -
september 15, or until journal is full]

The guidelines are as follows:
my [ideal] conception is: for this to be a showcase of diverse voices of
the arts & criticism. i would like the focus to be on the creative
process, i.e., i would like the submissions to be of ideas, concepts,
notes -- not simply of finished (polished) pieces. the RAW is invited:
works that may retain the edge of their (hopefully inspired) inception.
this means the desire is for experimental work -- however obscure.

nonetheless:
the guidelines are very broad as cauldron & net is particularly
interested in showcasing the wide variety of the diverse voices which
may be found on the Net. that means that [almost] all is invited:
literature, poetry, nonfiction [creative or otherwise],
hypertext/hypermedia, theory, criticism, reviews, music, photographs of
performance or other 'hard-copy' art,experiments, outlines /sketches of
ideas, jottings, notes, proposals, research papers, sophistries, etc.,
etc., etc. quality is really the only criterion [though of course such
judgments are left to the discretion of a rather opinionated editor].
programmers and computer scientists who have ideas and/or work that a
'wired' laywo/man could grasp are [enthusiastically!] invited to submit
also.

simultaneous submissions and work that has already been published will
be considered, although the preference is for unpublished work.

please send all inquiries / submissions as e-mail attachments [as plain
text in the body of a mail if you work on a Mac] or URL indications in
the body of a mail to: cauldron@studiocleo.com

Editor

Hi All,

I'm compiling a list of little poetry magazines to give to my students in my
contemp. Amer. poetry course at UC Santa Cruz.  Could anyone with the info
please e-mail me subscription rates, etc. so I can plug it for you?  Also,
as I mentioned in an earlier post, all contributions are welcome if you want
to send promo material (i.e. copies of the mag) that I can pass out as
prizes.  Many thanks to those who've already sent stuff!  The class is now
in full swing, & it's only five weeks--don't miss your chance to contribute
to the further canonization of everything.

Thanks,

Kasey Mohammad

this query. As a point of clarification, this paragraph
comes from from section 5 of the (new) Welcome Message:

Posting on the list is a form of publication. However, please do not
publish list postings without the express permission of the author!
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the

published materials.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 800 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform, and
extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the list administrators at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed
by the editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel
free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether
a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and should
be directed to us at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are always welcome. We also welcome discussions of poetry and poetics
in keeping with the editorial function of the list.

Solicited contributions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The moderators reserve
the right to contact any subscriber regarding possible contributions.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <POETICS@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Format of Email Messages - PLEASE READ

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text".
The use of "styled" text or HTML formatting in the body of
messages sent to the list disrupts the Listserv's automatic
digest and archive features by adding lengthy passages of
markup tags that will not be interpreted from the digest by
most email programs or by a web browser when viewing the
list archive. Note, however, there is no problem with
sending clickable URLs in HTML format.

Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Communicator users take note!
You may need to specify "plain text" or "ASCII text" or "text only"
in the outgoing messages section of your application Preferences.
Check your application's Edit | Preferences or Help menus for
further details.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

-------------------

5. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Submissions to the list should be in ASC-II (text-only) format
and should contain NO HTML TAGS! HTML tags interfere with the
automatic digest and archive functions of the listserv program,
and will not be forwarded to the list. Subscribers using
Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Communicator and like applications
to manage their email service should check the "Preferences"
or "Options" section of the program in question to be sure that
HTML formatting options are disabled before posting to the list.

Attachments may not be sent to the Poetics List. Messages
containing attachments will be presumed to be worm- or virus-
carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Posting on the list is a form of publication. However, please do
not publish list postings without the express permission of the author!
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

6. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

7. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

8. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

9. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

The EPC's mission is to serve as a gateway to the extraordinary
range of activity in formally innovative writing and digital media
poetry in the United States and around the world. The Center provides
access to extensive resources in new poetries. These include our
E-POETRY library, our links to digital VIDEO and SOUND (including
our award-winning LINEbreak series of radio interviews and performances)
as well as e-journals such as lume, Deluxe Rubber Chicken, Alyricmailer,
and many others, the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of
electronic poetry texts and bibliographies, and direct connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides
information about contemporary electronic poetry magazines and print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics.
Visit the EPC's many libraries, the featured resources available on
the EPC home page, or its NEW listings, where recent additions are
available for quick access.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

10. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

Hope you can make it--it's a cozy little cafe and it all starts with a 20
minute open mic if you want to read your stuff


Here are the directions:

Tillie's is located at 248 DeKalb Avenue at the corner of Vanderbilt Avenue

okay the finals for the team selection to represent Cleveland at the
National Poetry Slam are looming ahead. Sunday July 9 at the Beachland
Ballroom 6pm. 8 bucks to get in. There is one more qualifying round
before then at the Humidor Sunday July 2nd at 8pm. We really need
everyone to come out and support these efforts.

a lot of crazy stuff happened this year - venues closing - illness - a
bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths after the Nationals last year, but
we're plowing ahead thanks to the hard work of Kevin Webb who made sure
Cleveland would be represented at the Nationals this year. We have a
clean slate of qualifiers this year, none of the participants so far
have ever been on a team that has gone to the nationals. SO, we need you
to come out and support these people.

Help us fill up the Club Sunday July 9. We need 100 paying audience
members to get this crew to Providence Rhode island !

thanks

I'll stick with what I said since it has not been accurately assessed.

Examine Hillary Rodham's plan for seizing control of 1/6 of the US economy
and how she attempted to do it.  Fascist.

Surrounded by secret police in public who shove reporters away, can't even
shout a question a la Sam Donaldson for Her Highness to field.  Fascist.

Posture in the haunches of a Mussolini, the proud upturned jaw, the dream
driven self convinced eyes.  Fascist.

Attempted to castrate Senator Brook before Wellesley convocation to amplify
her POWER!  Fascist.

Hires private secret police to rummage through waste barrels of political
opponent (Terry Lenzner, Jack Palladino).  Fascist.

Bullet holes in the back of Ron Brown's head, autopsy abandoned, coroners
fired, x-ray photos lost.  Fascist.

The Victimizer proposes themselves as the Victim.  Hitler's M.O.! "This
trailer trash, Jones, is a paid hit person for the Vast Right Wing
Conspiracy who prevented me from educating the people of Arkansas."  If only
my hideous enemies would vanish I could get on with my mission of mercy.

Okay, you are right. She isn't a Fascist, according to Webster (but
Webster's definitions are many times tautologies).  She's a POLITICAL
CRIMINAL from the nose tilted to the sky FEMINAZI class! (Paraphrase from
that old time Democrat, Camille Paglia, and that anchored to the sea bottom
Conservative, Rush Limbaugh.)

Everybody see these articles in this Village Voice by Dodie Bellamy and Eileen Myles?  Bracingly candid personal accounts of experience/s of sexuality, gender, writing roles in honor of Pride weekend.  Having been attacked within the literary community before for having an "ambiguous" sexuality, (which, like an "ambigous" poetics, I gues makes some nervous), I really appreciated Dodie's sweet account of her relationship with Kevin Killian.  And Eileen Myles just rocks.

Did anybody besides me spot Rod Smith during C-Span's book weekend last week?  They were featuring a reading from Bridge Street Books of a fine Hegel biography -- whenever the camera panned back over the crowd you could see my favorite young Hegelian, Rod Smith, beaming from his post near the door.  I hope he gets residuals.

I know C-Span insists that these book weekends are devoted to non-fiction, but you'd think they could tape a poetry reading once in a while, since they're going to Bridge Street anyway -- What if the poets promise to read only non-fiction poems?

Wow!  So much rant just to ultimately agree with me.  Mrs. Prez is not a
fascist.  Whether or not she is a political criminal--well, some would argue
that's no oxymoron.  Politicians are de facto criminals, and that would
include whoever has you in his/her pocket.  But that's just one argument, one
example of fashionable dysphoria.  So you really, really hate Hillary
Clinton.  Fine, you're an angry right winger--way right.  But your bias
doesn't make you correct.  If reserving a percentage of the economy for
designated use is a criminal act, then social security and welfare (personal,
military and corporate) also qualify.   And, of course, anyone who suggests
that we should all contribute to keeping poor people alive and well must be
evil.  As for reporters, Reagan avoided their questions also.  Remember the
"I can't hear you" routine?  If the victimizer's playing the victim is
Hitleresque, then Linda Tripp must also fit the bill.  As for Hillary's postur
e, now you're talking!!   No better way to find a fascist than by measuring
the angle of her chin.  You're a laugh riot!  You love those conspiracy
theories.  I assume most, if not all, of your commentary was written with
tongue planted firmly in cheek.  If not, I'll pray for you.  You can't win
this one, as I think you realize.  Let's move on.  Best wishes for a speedy
recovery.  Hope you got cash.  Those socialist insurance policies--you know,
where the healthy people pay for the sick ones--don't come cheap.

something that is not typed, but is a result of typing. providing that the
result may be unforeseen, or of a quantity sufficiently larger than the
letter strokes used to produce it. providing that the result is a policy.
providing that a policy is a contract between a program and an algorithm
and a substitution and a configuration, providing that a policy is a
protocol. typing through protocols waiting in the distance, working one's
way through processes, returning to the _process degree zero,_ that is
the process of typing "itself," the iconic in place of the indexical, the
symbolic only a memory of the superstructure of the others, all there is
of the others, the un/seemliness of totality. typing, what is occurring
now, a precedent to your reading, simultaneous and relying on data-place-
ment, memory - maintenance, protection, coding and decoding. will that be
an operation? online it is an operation - indexical, symbolic. but else-
where, iconic, one to one with the matrix of its substructure or sheet of
assertion, i would say, sheet of the residue of its initial creation. and
it is so easy to lose oneself, programs waiting in the distance, there are
algorithms waiting in the distance, there are substitutions and configur-
ations waiting in the distance!

did it ever occur to you that nazis were a specific group of people with

to fall into the pop-culture trend of referring to everything you don't like
as being "[whatever]nazi" shows incredible ignorance and arrogance.
diminishing history, inflaming the present.
just because you don't like someone/something doesn't mean s/he or it (say,

tho if feminism--that is to say, equality for all people--did rule the world,
well, i think the world wd be a much better place. but that's neither here

what is here, there, and everywhere, is your use of terms and images without

yawn...

please cease and desist in this silliness. if you don't like something,
perhaps you could elaborate your displeasures rather than using supposed

apologies for cross-posting

updated invitation to submit work to _on word_ (Writers Forum's 1000th
publication edited by Bob Cobbing and Lawrence Upton

As editors of _on word_ we have extended the deadline for receipt of
submissions to 30th September 2000, because

(a) there is not yet sufficient appropriate work

(b) finance is still being sought

Therefore, all are invited to submit to "on word" - see the text of the
invitation below

Everyone with who has sent work with s.a.e. / i.r.c. or who has sent an
email reply address with their work, will hear from the editors during July
2000.

________________________________________________________

As its 1000th publication, Writers Forum plans another special! It will be
called "on word" and will be as big as finance permits. This is an
invitation for you to send work for consideration for inclusion - but please
read on first.

We hope to produce an eclectic anthology of investigative,
positively-experimental work, with supporting statements where appropriate.
We are interested in seeing work across the range of poetry from linear
verbal to non-verbal visual work by poets who, regardless of gender or race,
have in common their commitment to "making it new" - those who are, in our
judgement, trying new things, open to ideas, still surprising.

The proposed book is intended not just to provide a showcase of energetic
contemporary work, much of it not available through existing anthologies,
but also a bridge and speculative map into the new poetries being worked out
now.

Like WF750 the approach will be international.

We want to see contributions from younger poets, however one defines
"younger", but not exclusively.

As a speculative book, attention will be paid to emerging forms and media
including approaches which cross traditional and accepted boundaries.
Ideally, the publication will include CDs to present aural performance, to
examine the use of colour, to present some of the work in "the emerging
technologies".

At present, we know that we are able to publish a print publication of
limited scale; further funding is being sought to enable us to fulfil our
wider ambitions.

For now, you are invited to send 4 (four) pages, camera ready. The size
should be in the proportion 210 (wide) : 297 (high).

Please send s.a.e. / i.r.c. for return of your work. If you are on email,
let us have your email address.

If it becomes possible to include CDs further announcements will be made.
All such announcements will be published at the WF website.

http:// matrix.crosswinds.net/members/~writersforum/

At present, all we want is work on paper.

These guidelines are intended to be self-explanatory; but if you have any
question, write to either editor with sae / irc or email Lawrence Upton on
lawrence.upton@britishlibrary.net

Submissions to "on word", which fit these guidelines (intended to save us
all wasting time), should be sent, with s.a.e. / i.r.c. to either:

Lawrence Upton
(WF1000)
32 Downside Road
London N5 2QT
Sutton
Surrey SM2 5HP
UK

or

Bob Cobbing
(WF1000)
89a Petherton Road
London N5 2QT
UK

Revised deadline: 30th September 2000

Publication date: 1st January 2001 or later

If the historical writings of  Peggy Noonan, Anne Coulter, Laura Ingrahm,
Camille Paglia, and the others who are investigating HRC, political
criminal, are too deep for your perusal, then you and I aren't going to be
able to debate.  I don't debate opinions and feeling.  (You are entitled to
your delusions until you attempt to implement them through your demagogues
into public policy.)  I debate the historical record.
None of which, as assertions, you can handle.

Hooo! Hah!  Joy!

A couple of hours ago the guy at the mailroom handed me a package with
Belgian stamps and I whooped with joy.  Not because Belgian stamps are
particularly cool looking (in fact, the guy on the stamps looks a lot
like Al Gore).  No, I was all worked up because I knew this had to be
the long-awaited...

        Mechanics of the Mirage: Post-War American Poetry
        (ISBN 2-87233-025-9)

Edited by Belgium's dynamic duo lit crit tag team, Michel Delville and
Christine Pagnoulle.

There's some great stuff in here -- 17 essays, including:

        Paul Hoover's "Murder and Closure"
        Peter Middleton's incredibly cool "1973"
        Steve Evans on the American Avant-Garde after 1989
                (**by the way -- where is Steve? Every time I mail him
                his copies of Samizdat he seems to have moved)
        Maria Damon's "The Poetics of Poetry"
        Mark Leahy on Bruce Andrews
        Sarah Riggs on Frank O'Hara
        Me, blathering on about something or other
        Antoine Caze, on Langpo (neither a disciple nor a sworn enemy, he)
        Kornelia Freitag on Rosmarie Waldrop
        Peter Nicholls on Lyn Hejinian

        (and much much more, as they say in the Ginsu Knife ads)

Also poetry by:

        Keith Waldrop
        Rosmarie Waldrop
        Paul Hoover
        Maxine Chernoff
        Jennifer Moxley

And a sort of performance piece by:

        Joe Amato and Kass Fleisher.

This is all material from a conference at Liege held a while back, which
I reported on for Jacket Magazine. You can read about it at:


        http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket06/liege.html


Anyway, this is a book many listees will want to have around.  Pick up a
copy, pop open one of those Belgian Trappist beers that come in bottles
the size of your head, and you're in business.

Amities,

Could anyone point me to a good politics mailing list?
I am looking for some engaging conversation about
poetics, and since the poetics lists are usually about
politics - not even politics really, but elections - I
have to figure that all the political pundits are
discussing contemporary poetry, aesthetics, and
matters of a literary nature.

What the hell?  How did I miss the above prose poem the first time
around?  A brilliant protrayal of the crazed mind of the right-wing
conspiracy hunter.  Congratulations on a fine psychological portrayal of
political dementia.

Point One.
The URL for Writers Forum given in our recent posting is incorrect.
Apologies for this. The address was changed by the service provider; cut and
paste + Upton's memory loss provided the error

http://www.crosswinds.net/~writersforum/

Point Two.
Please do not send submissions by email without prior arrangement

Point Three.
There is *no point in sending material which requires us to include a CDROM
until we know that is possible - see the invitation

Hey all,

Since several people have backchanneled asking how to order "Mechanics
of the Mirage" I'm posting to the list, rather than replying to everyone
individually.

There's a web page with book info and mail/e-mail contacts for ordering,
up at:

http://www.ulg.ac.be/facphl/uer/d-german/L3/delvpub.html

Also, with the ISBN I listed in the post, you can get any decent
bookstore to order it for you.

This puppy goes for thirty bucks, paperback with some kind of expensive
and durable paper inside and a decent binding.


Important Note:

I see my subject line said "New Book with Essays on the Usual Suspects
and More Bernstein."  While Charles is always on my list of usual
suspects, I'm not sure how his name got on my subject line.  I meant for
it to read "New Book with Essays on the Usual Suspects and More."

(Too much cutting and pasting?  Or has C.B. just become that
ubiquitous?  Ever since that commercial for the yellow pages he's been
everywhere...).

The book does have several essays that refer to Bernstein, but is not
among the contributors -- so if you were going to order the book just to
see his work, be forewarned.  Mea culpa.

Mary Burger, David Cameron, Sharon Mesmer, Chris Daniels, Dana Stevens,
Fernando Pessoa & about 30 others.  Also, don't miss essays by Marcella
Durand, & Tom Devaney, poems stickers by Mike Topp & two crossword puzzles

um, yeah.

well, i don't care to engage in debates with people who are lying to

Mr. Dillon:

        I don't think you have as yet done enough as you call it
historical research.
        For example, have you seen a number of the now well known
documentaries put together by various Christiabn groups regarding
"HRC, polictiacl criminal" as you call her?

        They are quite frequently shown on your local Christian
network--and if you watch these channels, you will be provided with the
requisite information for ordering a copy.
        The proceeds as you know will go to a good cause.
        Having watched a number of thse documentaries, in which HRC's
proven
political criminal activities have included the murder of Vince Foster, I
am
convinced that HRC gas extended her sphere of political criminal activity
into the State and politics of New York in a particuarly heinous manner.

        She has obviously caused the prostate cancer which has felled
Mayor
R. Giuliani in his campagn against her in the New York State Senatorial
elections.

        Ronald Reagan was an inspiration to us all when he used to
emphasize one of his favorite quotes, from the Russian, "proveri no
doveri" (sp.?)--"trust but verify".

        Therefore I urge you, if you are to be true to your own claims for
historical assertions, to verify and extend your field of researchs.

        Even a politial criminal such as Karl Marx knew that if we do not
learn from the lessons of history, we are condemned to repeat them.

        The first time as tragedy, he said, and the second--as farce.

        So, please check out your local TV listings for the Christian
channels.

        The good documentaries usually come on at noon here.

        High noon.

The exact idea:  HRC, a prima donna used to getting her way, decided to
attack Senator Edward Brooke, a Black African American, at the Wellesley
convocation ceremony because she had disapproved of his position - anti
rabble rousing - on anti-War demonstrations.  She did this to promote
herself, as we, her opponents, read it, as a stalwart proponent of SDS
politics.  Peggy Noonan and others have noted that in her extemporaneous
remarks a strange secondary theme employing vague references to female
erotic needs in relation to politics emerged out of Hilarity's mouth.  Those
there who were never her sycophants wondered just what she was getting at
and why.  And so we employ the word, "castrating," as in "castrating
feminists."  (As in those feminists who can't stand to see a private
organization, The Boy Scouts, pursue educational agendas of male education
that exclude them and their views, which would be tantamount to permitting
Hugh Hefner or Larry Flynt, Democrat Party guru, fed secret files by said
Lenzner, to run a Girl Scout club.)  She tried to take the guy out to
amplify her POWER. "You GO, Girl!"

Terry Lenzner, Hilarity's private detective, who sorts through her enemies
(See the women who cried "Rape!") garbage, was also hired by the Oracle
Software Corporation to rummage through trash heaps of the Microsoft Corp.
Is it a coincidence only that it was Hilarity's administration who recently
concluded its Justice Department attack on Microsoft?

And you want to let her gain control of the medical records of the U.S.
citizenry just as she gained control of 900 FBI files of former Republican
employees and officials in the White House.

"Did she have a knife(?)"  No, she merely found a man to issue executive
orders for her.  Just as she found a criminally minded man to run phony
cattle future plays for her.  Just as she dropped the word, let it be known,
that there were people who simply had to go, "corrupt cronies," in the White
House travel office.  And thus the full force of the Federal police were
unleashed upon innocent Republican people, women and men, who had never done
anything to her and whose lives, financial and professional, would forever
be damaged.  The evil effrontery of this fiend to deny that she had any
direct authority over what happened to these people.  And you have the
arrogant temerity to dismiss these charges by attacking me, personally,
another innocent messenger.

What the hell?  How did I miss the above prose poem the first time
around?  A brilliant protrayal of the crazed mind of the right-wing
conspiracy hunter.  Congratulations on a fine psychological portrayal of
political dementia.

ABC of Reading TRG

Peter Jaeger



ABC of Reading TRG examines the writings of Steve McCaffery and
bpNichol, with a special focus on their collaborative work as the Toronto
Research Group (TRG). The book expands what little criticism there is on
the Group's collaborations by exploring their engagements with literary
theory, by differentiating between each writer's personal concerns, and by
reading their reports in conjunction with their individually authored
writings.

On the one hand, it reads TRG's reports "against the grain"i.e. it
attempts to uncover the unconscious links among repressed affective and
political elements that circulate throughout their writing. This approach
predominantly entails situating TRG in the shadow of perspectives
developed by Lacan, Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Zizek. On the other hand,
it also reads the TRG reports sympathetically, by underlining their
construction of a positive, productive desire which does not centre on
lack, but which actively celebrates multiplicity
and affirmation, an approach that chiefly reads the group in the light of
theories proposed by Barthes, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and Julia
Kristeva. Readers can operate this book either by reading it
conventionally from beginning to end, or by following chains of thought,
indicated by superscript letters which link non-sequential chapters
togethera device borrowed from Book 5 of bpNichol's The Martyrology. The
rhetorical artifice of the alphabetical framework affords a means to
preserve one of the TRG's most significant contributions to research
writing on contemporary poetics, i.e. their simultaneous stress on both
form and critical investigation.

In the end, ABC of Reading TRG is not so much about what the Toronto
Research Group's reports are about, but about what they invite us to think
about.

Other critical books on bpNichol available from Talonbooks:
