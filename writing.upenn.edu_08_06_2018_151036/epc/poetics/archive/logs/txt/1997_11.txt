Hi,

The Cross-Cultural Poetics Conference in Minneapolis
felt like a strong friends and allies gathering
in search of a shareable agenda. That agenda remained
largely illusive.

Still, I enjoyed it, but then i liked Minneapolis very much
as a friendly and relaxed city. Lots of decent cafes,
coffee houses, book stores, extraordinary music stores,
good museum collections (Walker collection plus Beuys' 'Multiples'
show, Wiseman's Pop in Gehry's extraordinary sardine cans buffeting the
Mississippi -  reflecting river, bridge and sky, with a very funny
show of Indian Humour, and the Minneapolis Institue of Art showing
much else besides a decent whack of Minor White photographs),
cheap, enticing Ethiopian and Vietnamese foods.

Lucky to be there just before the weather turned.

Maria Damon, Mark Novak and Leslie Denney (among others)
put a strong, sometimes too decision-racked schedule together.
Delegates were enabled to elect for all papers, less poets /
or more poets, less papers. A split that bears healing.
Still, it was a place to meet and exchange even though
important issues were neutralised for the duration.

Prize for most referenced works goes jointly to:

Theresa Hak-Kyung Cha's 'Dictee' (I'd add Walter Lew's equally
extraordinary response)
and Nathaniel Mackay (whose CD of 'Strick:Song of the Andoumboulou 16-25'
deserves wide appreciation)

Along with David Kellogg's report on Poetics (and an otherwise
curious silence on that list) I valued the presence and
contributions of:

-   Fred Wah, Jeff Derkson and Roy Miki's papers under Canadian
'multiculturalism' (from which many salutary lessons
can be brought into the UK context, particularly with
regards imminent developments in official policy here) and their 'readings'
from which a bevy of book recommendations:

Fred's 'Diamond Grill' and 'Alley Alley Home Free'
Jeff's 'Dwell'
Roy's 3 recent issues of West Coast Line magazine, of which
I'd stronglyly recommend 'Transporting the Emporium' (Hong Kong Art
& Writing Through The Ends of Time). An indespensible collection.

-   readings by Julie Patton, Susan Wheeler and Jen Hofer:

Susan's 'Bag 'O' Diamonds' is from University of Georgia and worth
tracking down.

-  Kamau Brathwaite's talk / reading was worth the trip alone.
His current layout work employing full range of computer typographies
is a great pleasure  -  and a great weaseling body of work
to bridge bigotted divides between tendencies. Check out Hambone (no.10)
to see what i mean. From, 134 Hunolt Stree, Santa Cruz, California 95060

-  presentation by Erik Belgum and Brian West of VOYS (CD mag).
first issue is Ray Federman (i'm slow to catch up with Federman, but am now
thick into the excellent 'Take It Or Leave It' which has a revised edition
out from the Fiction Collective) reading 'Voice In The Closet'
a must buy full reading of signal text and upcoming issues are equally strong.
'Exploring the dimensions of speech . . . of sign in sound.'
High production values. Sub Rates (2 CDs / year) $32 from uk.
Suscribe to Voys, PO Box 580547. Minneapolis. MN 55458. USA

-  papers by Alan Golding 'Po-Biz, Cult.Stud., and Avant-Gardes?'
(including a prolonged meditation on 'X' in post-war US writing) + Loretta
Collins 'Trouble It: Rebel/Revel Soundspace in the Caribbean Diaspora' +
Yunte Huang 'Charlie Chang vs Ezra Pound: Modern Conceptions of the Chinese
Language' all helped to assuage pangs left by reprehensible muffins and a
chronic milk shortage for the stewed coffee port.

-  finally a book that came my way out of a meal with the author (whose
everythig else i'd missed  -  that's often the irritating way with
conferences) that i've not seen mentioned before but which i'd recommend is:

Hilton Obenzinger's 'New York on Fire', a delightfully assembled chronicle of
fires that have ravaged New York ever since. Somehow reminded me of Paul
Metcalf who was another ghost presence at XCP

-  to whit the new journal XCP (cross cultural poetics) edited by Mark
Nowak with work by Amiri Barak, Maria Damon, Lise McCloud, Solomon Deressa,
Walter Lew, Ofelia Zepreda, Elizabeth Burns, Edwin Torres and others.

now. And considering contributing to.

Over the top home Halloween installations (ghosts crossing and re-crossing
the porch, blooming luminous from cupboards like cuckoos, chair-size
pumpkins), the Snoopy theme park that forms the centrepiece of the Mall of
America, cross street raised glass walkways, inner city reservations (with
some of the highest infant mortality levels in the world).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After all that I arrived in Buffalo just in time to preface a reading from
Caroline Bergvall with the first outing for 'Double Sky Hope's Locker' (out
now from SVP). Caroline read a strong set featuring 'In Situ', 'Don't Push
It', from the work she's been calling 'Greek Myth Since Freud' and a pithy
sequence on bilingualism she's been writing 'on the road'.

Next day we picked our hangovers to hear Steve McCaffery's bravura lecture on
'Text, Lay-out and Memory' during which he took Derrida's logo-centrism to
task, set out to reclaim so-called illuminated manuscripts from art
historians by dint of proving that the 'illustrations' instead formed part
of a working grammatalogy  -  were writing 'in other words'  -  that
letters were highly motivated and that Mary Carruthers takes what Frances
Yates opened on memory to fresh heights. All eyes out for the MIT anthology
from Steve in the New Year. I'm paraphrasing a rangey and procative talk
wildly here.

London, Ontario has its own Oxford Steet and River Thames. Also some fine
neon signage in sans-serif fonts 'Live Lobsters  -  Now Hiring', that sort of
thing. Five (exluding myself, although i got an honourary form of
membership) of the now infamous Buffalo School of Homophonic Translation
read in the Forest City Gallery  -  organised by Peter Jaeger, Tom Orange
and Kevin Hehir.

There was a full house, including members of the aging but very much still
active Nihilist Spasm Band. Taylor Brady, Scott Pound, Bill Howe, Eleni
Stecopoulos and Mike Kelleher are all strong readers with distinctive work.
A younger grouping and 'on the move'. Eleni, Taylor, and myself all joined
Bill in a preview of the overture from his opera, bringing the evening to a
rebarbitive finale. We gave local radio interviews to a fresh-faced
dictaphone low on batteries and the event will be marked by a selection
from all in Rampike.

Finally McCaffery and myself (realising it was almost 20 years to the day
since the 11th Sound Poetry Festival in Toronto) opened a joint show of
visual work in the Cornershop gallery, Buffalo (a guerilla show put on by
Bill Howe  -  who with Scott Pound edits the also excellent Essex Magazine
of visual poetics, 2 issues available to date - and who paid homage to
boxes of Alphabits [best language trauma Marlon Brando as The Godfather
image of the decade award], read a longish poem and performed a piece we'd
put together that week on his letterpress).

Steve's work was effectively a thirty year retrospective showing the
diversity and sustained attack of hisvisual / spatial poetics practices. He
performed the whole of Carnival panel 2, for the first time. A solo tear de
fierce, major. I read some 'f o gs', did some punch & judy Beefheart on the
megaphone and a solo version of 'you see the sights but you don't see the
struggle it's a struggle to see it's kept out of sight' with rusty metal
thumb clickers. Wine floored.
There was bird chitter. Carnivalesque revelry broke out until late,
followed by a champagne, dry martini and bloody mary brunch. Touring could
certainly put paid to me!

then  -  as you know by now, hurrying for the London double 'things' went
'orribly 'wrong'. My additional thanks to everyone involved in these events.
Wishing there was more corporeal cross-pond traffic.

love and love

Mark: Being a book dealer, on Wednesday I purchased a fairly large group
(26 boxes) of psychoanalytic titles from a retiring psychoanalyst. I had
told a number of my customers who are psychoanalysts that I would likely
have some of the material available for sale on Saturday. So as they
trickled in and we talked I mentioned that you had insisted that medical
doctors and psychoanalysts were not scientists. To a person they
protested your characterization. They cited their long medical training
and its obvious adherence to the scientific method. Some also mentioned
diagnostic and pharmacological functions as requiring their skills as
scientists. My store is just two miles from the National Institutes of
Health where many M.D.s some of them psychoanalysts take part in
'scientific' research, including epidemiology. Not far from my house at
Fort Detrick scientists have spent decades fabricating plagues in a
laboratory.
On the matter of my paranoia at least one of my customers, good
naturedly, suggested that you had a point but hastened to add that his
was not a professional diagnosis and that you had not defined your term.
On the specific nature of my paranoia concerning corporate funding for
reactionary intellectual agendas, I am indeed in suspect comapny, for
example Stanley Fish and his book, There's No Such Thing As Free
Speech--remaindered $6.98. Another inmate however is James A. Smith, the
author of the Idea Brokers, Free Press, $24.95, a study of the history
and development of think tanks and foundations and their sources for
funding. Here in D.C. I am surrounded by these corporate funded think
tanks and foundations which are predominately conservative and many
downright reactionary. They DO serve as financial and publishing
conduits for everyone I mentioned in my earlier E-mail. Smith's is one
of a number of excellent books on this subject and their authors are not
generally considered paranoid. Neither is Fish for that matter; he has
suffered many attacks from the same sources Smith sites. I guess by
association I could claim that I'm not paranoid; but if I am I came by
it honestly and as the doctor said it's not clinical.---Carlo Parcelli
P.S. The Smith book really is useful. His work on game theory, systems
analysis, operations research et al and its connection with big defense
oriented budgets is particularly good. For the consequences of the
mating of game theory et al with the military try the Perfect War:
Technowar in Vietnam. This book of course has particular import for
people of my generation. I think that it is important to remember that
the Deconstruction movement got a great deal of impetus from the student
strikes of 1968, a time in France of tremendous political and social
repression.
PPS: My bookstore is considered one of the best stores in the city for
scientific books especially physics and math. Scientists who venture
into my used book shop are often stunned by the quality of the books
that I carry on the sciences especially if I've been fortunate enough to
recently have purchased a good library. Some of the people on this list
have shopped at my store and I'm certain that they will attest to the
excellent nature of the selection in all areas. I acquired the ability
to buy at this level by reading the product.

Psychoanalysts think that psychoanalysis is scientific. Astrologers feel
that way about astrology. No one except psychoanalysts and their patients
think it's a science, which doesn't mean that it's never helpful. Some
doctors, even psychiatrists, are also scientists. Many diagnose and apply
treatment as if reading from a cookbook, many practice herbal medicine and
homeopathy as well as what they've learned in med school (this is becoming
more common as the profession feels the insurance squeeze, and it's being
sold to doctors as a cure for their economic woes. Apparently the many
doctors who succumb to temptation didn't have very secure scientific
training).

People outside the profession often don't realize that most psychiatrists
are not psychoanalysts. Your psychoanalytically-inclined customers defended
their claim to science by citing non-psychoanalytic psychiatric procedures.

I was a psychiatric social worker in agency and private practice for 15
years. I knew lots of psychoanalysts, and I diagnosed hundreds of patients.
Here's a diagnostic story. An MD sent a diabetic woman to a clinic where I
worked because she refused to give herself her insulin shots. She
complained that they made her feel bad, reporting symptoms which he
interpreted as psychosomatic. The visiting nurse managed to talk her into
letting her administer the shot at home every day, but that was getting
expensive and the woman still complained. The visiting nurse thought she
was after attention. The usually sensible psychiatrists on our staff had
all kinds of theories about the symbolic meaning of needles. I got the
case. The woman appeared slightly bizarre, but not so's you'd cross the
street to avoid her. I asked her what she meant when she said that the
shots made her feel bad. She described hypoglycemia. I called her doctor,
he lowered her insulin dose, and she started giving herself her own
injections. Her bizarreness, a product of her hypoglycemia, also
disappeared. A ten minute cure. We spent a fruitful 6 months working
through the fallout of her recent divorce for her and her children.

It's nice talking about triumphs, and I wish it were always that easy. In
this case a lot of folks trained in the scientific method had failed to
apply Occam's Razor. Given a little more time they would have succeeded in
killing the patient.

Here's another one. My wife's leg was exposed to toxic chemicals at work.
Lesions formed and began to suppurate. Our doctor insisted it couldn't be a
burn, treated her with antibiotics, when she got worse hospitalized her and
treated her with IV antibiotics. These didn't help. He had her seen by a
rheumatologist who immediately diagnosed her with Lupus. When the tests
came back it was clear she didn't have lupus, so he diagnosed her with
another form of immune system deficit based on an elevated protease
inhibitor. I went to the books, and also to another doctor. Depressed
amounts of that protease inhibitor are the indication for the condition he
had diagnosed; an elevated amount is typical in cases of chemical burns. My
wife did eventually get better because we took case management into our own
hands. All those doctors were trained in the scientific method.

This was not a particularly subtle case. The chemical exposure was known.
And it looked like a burn. When we finally got her to a dermatologist he
asked where she'd gotten the burn.

Everybody has had run-ins with careless or seriously inept doctors. This
was a whole medical class-worth. They would all claim they were scientists.

As it happens, I am qualified to diagnose paranoia, but I would never make
a serious diagnosis of anything beyond tendencies in that direction without
more information and preferably at least one face-to-face meeting. Of
course, I'd never ask someone on a shopping trip to diagnose me, either,
whatever his qualifications.

It's important to distinguish between the awareness that there are bad
things in the world (and people, even classes, with bad motives doing them)
and the construction of systems based on conspiracies that would seem so
elaborate that they would fall of their own weight. (Your appeal to the
zeitgeist is more convincing, but would need to be fleshed out a bit to
make a serious claim to explaining the historical context of
deconstructivism.)

Paranoia is not a series of ideas, it's a thought pattern.

I'm real fond of Occam's Razor.

That's it for me. I shouldn't call you crazy, and you shouldn't defend your
sanity, in public. And I think we may have taken enough of the list's time.
I look forward to browsing your bookstore when I have the chance. Of
course, I'll use an assumed name.

This can be considered a weird and scary reference question.

Yesterday I had a student ask me if I could help her find information on
Edgar Allen Poe.

She told me that "I don't know much about him except that he won a Grammy or
something."

I'm happy to say that she was better informed when she left our library.

Just a plug for Harryette - the reading she did at Temple was wonderful.
An interview that Farah Griffin, Kristen Gallagher and I did with her
while she was in Philly will be available somewhere soon at which point
I'll let y'all know.  -Mike.

What  a drag -- so many gone this year, among those who taught &
delighted me, & now, after Ginsie & Burroughs, it's

SAM FULLER

doing  his final cut.

Sam was one of the funniest, most gloriously impish & irreverent, best &
fastest talking (probably the only person I know able to outjaw David
Antin), most generous & honest persons it was my pleasure to have known.

                & the movies & the books! The only guy who made
successful B-movies in Hollywood with politics like no one else dared to
do in the fifties & when he had to leave  settled in Paris, wrote
scripts & stories & novels, undaunted, undauntable, pounding away on an
old mechanical typewriter all day long, then went back to Hollywood when
given a chance, made WHITE DOG which Paramount was so freaked out about
(it dealt head-on with racism) that they kept it shelved for twelve
years. He had started by making 2 of the finest, strangest westerns --
the first one from the p-o-v of the killer of Jessie James (& he always
wanted to do another one on the James gang, their sexualities,
especially) & later made CRIMSON KOMONO (2 detectives in L.A. -- one
white, one Japanese American -- looking for the bad guy, meeting the
blond bombshell & it is the japanese-american who walks away with the
lady at the end -- an unheard of thing for a middle fifties movie), &
then there is SHOCK CORRIDOR & a dozen others, with the best war movies,
so profoundly accurate that they are anti-war movies & he was only
allowed to do them by leaning heavy on the fact that he had been there &
seen it & that they were accurate. And PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, which
freaked J Edgar Hoover out because of the American anti-hero's total
disdain for FBI pressure re patriotism, so much so that J Edgar called
Fuller & tried to get him to change the dialogue or else... That same
movie was felt to be so "anti-communist" by the French (whose stalinist
Communist Party controlled the film distribution system in France in
those days) that the dialogue of the French version was totally
rewritten, turning a political spy/pick-pocket story into a pure
gangster movie, which didn't make any sense anymore. 'Nuff said.

I cld go on for hours -- did, some ten years ago, an oral
(auto)biography of Sam for French radio (still have the original
reel-to-reel tapes & will some day put together an English version if a
station over here is interested).

One anecdote before closing: one night -- in fact it was the night of
the day Orson Welles died, we found out driving home -- Fuller & I had
dinner in a Chinese restaurant (the only kind he liked, even in Paris) &
he tried to convince me that besides writing poetry I should make films.
I told him I didn't have a clue. So he said: "You don't need one, you're
a writer; to make a good movie all you need is a good story -- the rest
is easy -- directors, actors are a dime a dozen, all of 'em -- nothing
to it -- but without a good story you're dead. It's the writers who are
the important ones.." Then there was the story of how, the day of the
Cuban embargo, Yul Brynner bribed his (Sam's) tobacconist & sneaked into
Sam's humidor & made away with all his Cuban cigars, and then there are
the 1000 other stories I can still hear him telling.


Go out & rent one of his flicks -- or get Godard's "Pierrot le Fou" in
which he plays himself (briefly) or  Wenders' 'The American Friend"
where he plays a mafioso (& which also stars Nicholas Ray & Dennis
Hopper).

Hope they have a good supply of Cuban cee-gars wherever he's off to.

Pierre

Also, if you can find it (I know it's at Kim's, for those of you in NYC),
there's a fantastic movie called "Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made"
that you have to see. It's a documentary Jim Jarmusch made in 1994,
accompanying Sam Fuller to the same tiny village in the Amazon rainforest
where he had tried to make a movie (Tigrero, natch) some 50 years before --
I believe it failed because they couldn't get insurance. All the villagers
remember him, he gets this big smile around his cigar and tells stories
about John Wayne, Hollywood in the forties & fifties, studio politics, etc.
-- it's totally great. The scene where Fuller screens the footage he did
shoot, and the villagers see relatives long since gone, is very emotionally
powerful and is maybe now, sadly, parallel to the act of watching Fuller
tell dirty jokes in his lovely, raspy voice.

the list seems really dead lately.  I guess it goes through these phases.
people are busy with school, etc.  But it's down to a few bleeps, queries,
notices.  People are backchanneling, now cut that out!  I wonder if it's
dead for good?  I'm sure everybody has their own opinion.

Here's a topic(s) for discussion, maybe?

POETRY, ART & SOCIAL JUSTICE

The NEA debate is just one element of what seems to have been a de-funding
of the arts over a long period now.  I live in a semi-rundown urban school
district where the arts are simply not even near a priority.  If we think
that social equity should include some access to the tools & traditions of
re-imagining reality through art, we are in sad shape.  There was a big op-ed
piece in the Times a few weeks ago by I-forget-who saying the defunding of
NEA is probably a good idea because art is fundamentally based on extraordinary
individual talent & subjecting it to the democratic levelling process only
hurts the art.  This seems like a sad attitude.  There should be some sensible
middle ground which recognizes the value of the arts & provides some means
to pursuing it from primary school up.

So I'm interested in hearing from people out there who deal with poetry
and dramatic arts in the school systems as a way of providing some of
this foundation AND ALSO providing tools for young people to counteract
mass media commercial stereotyping of reality.  Anybody out there doing
anything like that?  Might be something to talk about in relation to
a "poetics"...  [I know this is a career for some people...]

I think I get it. 1) I write cadenced prose. Thank you!
2) Any noun can be substituted for any other noun and the sentence will
still appear to make sense, or at least express an opinion. A true revelation!

Henry,

Know how you feel right now. I have been a very active lurker of late. Does
that count for anything? The list server has been a little slow, especially
late last week when i had some posts temporarily held up in the server.

>the defunding of

This is a lame epitaph isn't it?  I say epitaph since one is implied by the
journalist (probably best remembered as I-forget-who) who wrote the thing. But
the feds are hell-bent on wrecking funding for the arts and arts education, and
so the only viable alternative (regarding your angle in this discussion) is
volunteerism. Where I work, they regularly ask for volunteers to tutor local
kids, but always it is in math or science since this is an engineering
design/manufacturing facility in South Florida. I would be a good idea to ask
those who oversee this program to expand our role to include the arts and
literature. Ironically enough, it was a retired volunteer at my high school who
tutored me in electronics in auto repair shop! I suppose involvement in the
local poetry readings in bookstores, or wherever, is another way to support
youth poetry.

It's a poser: I'm more active on the list when I'm most busy, because it's
a useful break if I'm chained to the computer anyway.

Anything that puts food in the mouths of poets and other artists or affords
them some recognition is to the good. On the other hand, I think that the
NEA's tack has not been the most effective way to help the arts find an
audience. I remember the poor benighted teachers who were forced to teach
poetry or art or music and had no love for their subject. What they taught
was that poetry is a stupid kind of riddle, museums are boring storage
houses for the best depictions of reality our ancestors could come by
before the centerfold, and music other than rock sucks. In other words,
they conveyed what they really felt, whatever the words might be that came
out of their mouths. What if the NEA spent its money teaching people to
love the arts or recruiting teachers who do? While that might force some
belt-tightening for the present, wouldn't it help seed the future?
I am haunted by the idea of the German coal and steel town of
Wupperthalthat funds with its taxes the Wupperthaler danzteater, surely one
of the most challenging and best performance companies around. I'm told the
locals take a pride in it that we tend to reserve for basketball teams.
Somehow these workers got the idea that it was alright to like these
extremely strange and sometimes painful events.

Dear Listopolitans - a heads up from Ralph Metzner re: yet another insidious

Dear All --
"Health-minded Americans are presently facing the greatest threat to the
freedom of health choice ever before encountered, through an organization
known as the UN/WHO CODEX... The Codex is in reality an underhanded,
politically motivated, weakly disguised attempt by the international
pharmaceutical cartel to limit access to many popular, safe and
cost-effective nutritional and herbal supplements in order to take control
of the alternative healthcare industry." (from a letter by Mitchell
Fleischer, MD, Univ. of Virginia)  It's part of the more general take-over
of the global economy by the multinationals through WTO, courtesy of GATT
and NAFTA.   Read On....

There's a list of lists at gopher://gopher.english.upenn.edu/11/Lists/
Their listings includes beat-l, cap-l (contemporary American poetry),
modbrits (might include some poetics, but not much), and tse (T. S. Eliot,
which we run here at Missouri). They don't seem to have an entry, oddly,
for Poetics--nor for the Pound list at Maine. And I'm sure there is a
discussion list for Irish poetry and literature somewhere. I also run a
very small
James Merrill list--discussing JM's symbolist poetics of late.

What I'd like to see is a list that would discuss modern poets: for
example, Stevens, Moore, Crane, Frost, Loy, Williams, Hughes, Auden,
Moore.  In other words, poets in the first generation of modernists who
don't have a list
of their own (Pound, Eliot) and who wouldn't be discussed on cap-l or poetics.

Brent or anyone else, would you be interested in such a list?

YES, Yes, yes.

I'd be VERY interested in a list that discusses Auden, Crane, Stevens,
Moore, H.D., Frost and so on.

As a parent, a poet, and an arts volunteer, I haven't found volunteerism a
viable answer to loss of arts funding. There's no long term in it, and it
tends to go against the grain of the whole school project. Rather, I have
begun to ask: Why is poetry being taught in school? I have come to suspect
that the way it is taught precludes any sort of success. Here in Canada at
least it is taught as a means of expressing emotions, and moreso (almost
entirely) as a means of teaching students rhetoric. Until we get to the
point where poetry is taught for poetry's sake, where poetry is used as a
rigorous and independent means of ordering or disordering the world, we
will all continue to lose funding, because the funding will go to rhetoric
(for example) and not to poetry (as it already is). There's just no future
in that. As for readings in bookstores or wherever, there's a thought: get
the students out of the school and into a community. That is not
volunteerism, though. Rather, it is an interesting project.

Well, not a revelation maybe, but reading your piece I was struck by the
notion that you had written a little poetry generating machine, such a
balanced piece of syntax that it could hold most any noun and process it.
For what, though, I don't know. I shall ponder that.

Mark,

If memory serves me right, Wupperthal is not exactly a coal and steel town
pure and simple. The example is good, and there are lots of examples of
support for the arts in Germany in general (Bochum is renowned for doing
Heiner Mueller's plays, and that's no small or easily accessible feat), but
Wupperthal (and Bochum) are quite gentrified, or, rather, there is enough
of a class mix as to put into question whether it is actually the
steelworkers who are going to the Danztheater or the Opel assembly workers
who are watching Brecht's legacy (Mueller) onstage.

I agree about the problem of messages in classrooms. I like your positive
approach. How, though, would the NEA spend its funds teaching people to
appreciate the arts? Wouldn't that be through access and relevence? That
could be either inside or outside of the classroom. As for recruiting
teachers who are inspired and thus inspire, why not hire artists and poets,
or train them to be teachers. There's the rub: can the school system bend
enough to accomodate them? Note, I didn't say "should" it, of course it
should.

Mind you, is that the issue: teaching people to appreciate the arts? Don't
they already? Whether it is painting their favourite subway car or
listening to sweet zounds of Nashville, there is an aesthetic and a
response of sorts. Could the issue be better rephrased as: "teaching people
a tradition of art" or "teaching people to use a method of art"? The art,
in other words, cannot be separate from the approach, or that darned hidden
message, the teacher who taught that museums are old meat lockers, etc.,
will sneak in there and defeat the whole project.

I read something about the German State Theatre in Berlin getting awfully
radical and dragging in some rough street culture into its productions and
in that most conservative of institutions (a national theatre, after all)
turning things on their head and making it work. Anybody can turn things on
their head, of course, but making it work aesthetically and financially is
the challenge.

I am haunted by the idea of the German coal and steel town of
Wupperthalthat funds with its taxes the Wupperthaler danzteater, surely one

Somehow these workers got the idea that it was alright to like these
extremely strange and sometimes painful events.

Yup, Wupperthal has a middle class, but it's pretty solidly rust belt. My
understanding is that Pina Bausch and her commandos really do get the
workers in their audience, and that even those who don't attend are willing
to spend their tax dollars and have civic pride about the result.

I don't have a program in mind, but I don't think there'll ever be enough
willing artists to stock the elementary schools. There may be enough,
however, to teach the teachers, and enough (not necessarily a majority) of
those teachers may become enough enthralled to change the culture of the
teacher's lounge.

As to what kind of art, what aesthetic experience is opened, I'd be content
to define it as whatever they have no access to now, and that means those
arts that require a vocabulary, verbal, visual or musical, and some
history. And I'm pretty unashamedly elitist about this. I don't think it
reactionary to want more people to be capable of experiencing some of the
more powerful experiences that human culture has generated.

I'm very interested in WHY that generation doesn't get discussed on CAP-L;
maybe they've been dead so long--the famous poets, I mean--that they're no
longer considered "c." But I like it when dead poets are discussed on
lists. I met Joseph Ceravolo here, for example, and have been smitten ever
since. ---Gwyn

I'm especially interested in Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams, but
yes, I'd be interested in such a list.  I wonder if it would be productive to
base the conversation around topics (broad or narrow), or particular
authors/poems, at least in the beginning.  That way, unlike so many of the
postings I've seen on the Pound and Eliot lists, folks would be having truly
collaborative discussions, rather than tons of disparate, parallel
conversations that are annoying to sample.

don't get me wrong, I like the work of some of these (Stevens, Crane,
though which Crane? Hart or Steven, Loy, Williams, Auden, and one of the
Moore but not the other) but aren't they well enough discussed?  Aren't
there already mounds and mounds of discussion of them?  I mean, a third
rate versifier like Frost is discussed constantly and ubiquitiously from
2nd or 3rd grade until post-doc.  Only Mina Loy, of that list, was not
included in my junior high school poetry syllabus.  (Who is this Hughes
person, though?  Do you mean Sylvia Plath's ex husband?) It was a public
school, too, though things may have changed in the intervening three
hundred years, but on the other hand, some of those poets were still
alive back then.

anyway: Stevens = cornbread-heavy Ashbery
Moore = obscure precursor of Alice Notley
Crane = obscure precursor of John Wieners
Frost = I prefer Kenneth Koch
Loy = wonderful
Williams = not Oscar, I hope
Hughes = place in literary history for abandoning Sylvia Plath
Auden = absolutely
Moore = Robert Lowell's psychiatrist, supposedly had affair with Lowell's
mother, a rather impressive feat.

Synopsis:
Conservatives complain that much contemporary art is obscene, while liberals
reply that art always subverts the social and political orthodoxy. Both are
wrong, says Frederick Turner. In this first book to take the "third side" in
the culture war, Frederick Turner offers a radically hopeful new vision,
based on a cosmology which views nature as intelligent, creative, and
self-ordering.

From Kirkus Reviews, 03/01/95:
Turner recycles some material from earlier university press books for this,
his grand synthesis that promises to overcome the stalemate in the culture
wars. Proponent of a ``third way'' or ``centrist'' position, Turner (Arts and
Humanities/Univ. of Texas, Dallas) rehearses the standard complaints about
our culture in crisis. Unlike traditional conservatives, though, he ventures
a prescription that goes beyond nostalgia for faith and values. A sober
critic of the so-called avant-garde, Turner posits a ``radical center''--``a
return to classical forms, genres and techniques in the arts'' that is
grounded in the latest research in anthropology and science. Turner fancies
his ``reconstructive postmodernism'' a new paradigm on the intellectual
horizon, and it's hard to imagine anyone familiar with all the disciplines he
brings together in this fascinating, if exhausting, book. A cogent critic of
anti-foundationalist thought (be it feminist, Marxist, or linguistic), Turner
reaffirms the need for hierarchy in the arts, for logic over force, and for
beauty over relativism. His multiculturalism is truly pan-cultural,
discovering the transcendent in all cultures. Turner's idea of a ``natural
classicism'' is remarkably transparent--he locates classical forms in nature
itself. Some of his other ideas are a bit obscure, and his tendency toward
unrelieved abstraction will turn off sympathetic readers. Turner's immediate
cure for cultural malaise is nothing less than a four-page manifesto that is
certain to provoke debate, and his discussion of biology is sure to be used
against him, despite his distinctly un-``bell curvish'' ideas. Turner's
fictional ``fable for the future''--a brave new world that resembles the
utopian cyberspace of the Tofflers--flirts with kookiness. A superb critic of
trendy feminist and multicultural ideas, Turner deserves a hearing in the
ongoing debate: He's Apollo to Camille Paglia's Dionysus. -

There's a list of lists at gopher://gopher.english.upenn.edu/11/Lists/
Their listings includes beat-l, cap-l (contemporary American poetry),
modbrits (might include some poetics, but not much), and tse (T. S. Eliot,
which we run here at Missouri). They don't seem to have an entry, oddly,
for Poetics--nor for the Pound list at Maine. And I'm sure there is a
discussion list for Irish poetry and literature somewhere. I also run a
very small
James Merrill list--discussing JM's symbolist poetics of late.

What I'd like to see is a list that would discuss modern poets: for
example, Stevens, Moore, Crane, Frost, Loy, Williams, Hughes, Auden,
Moore.  In other words, poets in the first generation of modernists who
don't have a list
of their own (Pound, Eliot) and who wouldn't be discussed on cap-l or poetics.

Brent or anyone else, would you be interested in such a list?

I haven't read it.  However, if this is the same Frederick Turner who
wrote a piece called "The Neural Lyre," then I'm hostilely disposed.  "The
Neural Lyre" was a defense of metered poetry using neurobiology and was,
bar none, the single stupidest essay to have speculated about the
relations of science and literature of recent years.  I've read some
other things of his in which he seems to know something about chaos
theory, but it's not enough to redeem him in my eyes.  Also, he's written
some "epic" poems ("Genesis" and "The New World" I think) which I only
read enough of to find repulsive.

Cheers,

Try  Langston Hughes.  Ever heard of him?  Kind of an important figure in
American poetry.
You might enjoy it...if you aren't too busy lurking.

Yes...I was thinking of some of the same examples as Mark W....I often do
when public funding for the arts comes up.  I'm really not well-informed
on this subject, but from what I remember I have read about a *number* of
striking instances like the one Mark describes...All from Germany (which
is to say West Germany)..There is a national cultural element going on
there, but as house commie I'm gong to suggest that there's something more
specifically political: much of western Europe never engaged in as
ruthless a demolition of public space as did the U.S. throughout the
mid-twentieth century.  This often had a lot to do with a more militant
labor movement (not so unusual if the comparison is with this country,
where the entire trade union structure sold out to management and became
its servents and lackeys, as they still are) and its expression in a
Social Democratic party, which puts greater pressure on societal
decision-making, bending it in the direction of greater, more open public
social culture.  The republicrat state machine in the U.S. has never been
about opening up public space.  That's a task only the majority of people,
organizing around a left program, can do.  There's lots of other things we
poet types can do to help open up more social cultural space; certainly
speaking out and organizing around NEA and similar structures is one (tho'
to my mind somewhat limited, because of the constricted and
unevenly-distributed nature of NEA pie); Henry is very right to suggest
that involvement in education is another--that's not my area by temperment
nor by choice, so I haven't much substantive to add there.  But a total
(dare I say it, radical) change in the very shape of our national culture
is what we need, and what examples like the the one Mark cites point
toward.  And that (like they say in book titles) is "why I'm a socialist."
The idea of socialism is less about governmental power or even the
economic system, than it is about the flowering of culture.

I'm not sure I would call "The Neural Lyre" stupid. It was not terribly
well supported with solid evidence, say for the three minute line buffer
in our brains, but it was at least an attempt to address what too few
people do: why we like rhythm. Neurobiology is not altogether the wrong
place to start as rhythm is a biological phenomenon as well as a cognitive
one, and why not allow neurobiology a say so in the matter?

thanks Patrick for that message on the CODEX.
I've heard enough about this often enough to be
concerned, so I just did a bit of checking up on
the www, & I might as well share it with the list.
then I'll be quiet & we can talk about poetics again.
the short form is:

1) the CODEX is an internat'l body seeking to establish
standards re food quality & handling, which, according to
them, includes vitamins & homeopathic medicines;
2) the CODEX operates under the joint auspices of the
United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) &
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO);
3) it has been repeatedly alleged by local & int'l consumer
& health advocacy groups that "vested interests of Northern
industrialized countries, & representatives of transnational
food industries have come to dominate the Codex process of
setting nutrition and safety standards";
4) the CODEX has not yet adapted the German standards,
& there is some opposition to them, but no guarantees;
5) the FDA is considering the amendment of its regulations
"to promote international harmonization", i.e., adopting the
standards set forth in the CODEX;
6) there seem to be strong penalties for nations who don't
comply, e.g., heavily sanctions (fines) by the World Trade
Organization (WTO).

it looks like it might be time to make some phone calls,
write letters, & whatnot, for those of us interested in
homeopathic medicine & vitamins. in addition to Patrick's
suggestions, I noted that the FDA seems to be seeking
input on this consideration:

Subject:      Other poetry discussions
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have been thinking about the idea of other discussion lists this morning,
and am wondering why there are no discussions on some of the other
contemporary poets that are around these days.  I never hear anything on
Merwin (a personal favorite of mine) or Levertov or other writers like
that. I saw a posting today announcing Rosmarie Waldrop's upcoming reading
tonight, but she and her work are never discussed here, either, and that is
a shame.  She and her husband are both amazing poets. I certainly don't see
myself as being attracted to only one or two "styles" of poetry, and would
really like to see a broad range of writers and styles addressed.
What do some of you think?  Is there a call to pursue this?

Not so oddly, given this statement from the welcome message to Poetics:

But then, who bothers to read (or save) the welcome messages for e-mail
lists?

As for starting a modernist poetry list, given the problems of
administering this list; the number of complaints folks make from time to
time about gettin gtoo much e-mail; & the general range of
non-contemporary, non-American poetry discussed from time to time on CAP-L
(Plath's husband is mentioned far more than any figures of the Harlem
Renaissance for instance) - it may make more sense to start discussing 20th
century American poets on CAP-L rather than to start a new list for the
subject.  Though people should probably raise the issue there first.

        Mark,
        "the flowering of culture"  -- "public space"
        poet-types can set the example for what I believe is a lost notion
to most non-poet-types (non-artists, I should say), but it's foggy, by
what means
        they can but may they?
        and if the notion of a public space is actually known to and held
sacred by all, why do we not dare to inhabit it?

        And another Mark (Weiss this time),
        Teach one to "love the arts"?  Help "the arts find an audience"?
This just doesn't make sense if one presumes that the arts are essential
to humankind.  Haughty belief?  Rash?  I don't think so.  Loving the arts
is like hating medicine. It's an irrational fetishizing. The arts are as
much an audience as an artist.

dear list,

Yes, this is v. important and is already having repercussions in Canada.
What to do is all below. Watch out for typos.
I sent [hard] copies to both Burke and Dingwall in June and never heard
back.
This seems to be the new style of government here in Branchplantland.

best and apologies for unpoetic content,
Susan


                  Anti-Codex Letter for Health Freedom
                                  Stats

 (all links on the word "Codex" take you to the World Health
 Organization)

 Send to David Dingwall, Minister of Health, House of Commons, Ottawa,
 Ontario, K1A 0A6 (FAX 613-952-1154), and to Ron Burke, Room 200,
 Health Protection Branch, Tunneys Pasture, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0L2
 (FAX 613-941-3537):

 Dear Mr. Dingwall/Mr. Burke:

 I am writing to inform you that I totally oppose the German
 delegations proposal to the World Health Organization's Codex
 Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses.

 The proposal to set worldwide dosage limits on nutritional supplement
 would effectively end my access to the benefits of safe dietary
 nutrients. My vitamins, minerals and other nutritional supplements I
 have used for years will no longer be available to me above RDA levels
 without a medical prescription, as the major pharmaceutical companies
 take over the dietary supplement industry.

 Since no supplement will be available for therapeutic or preventative
 uses, and all new products would be automatically banned until passing
 Codex approval, my health and my RIGHTS would be dangerously ignored.
 The cost of supplements would skyrocket, prohibiting their use by
 those who often need them the most--seniors and the chronically ill.

 Two steps have already been taken by the Codex Committee with very
 little public awareness. Step three is near the final ratification in
 the Codex process. Once ratified, Canada will be bound to comply under
 GATT regulations.

 I am strongly urging you, to do everything in your power to oppose the
 Codex Commission's proposal. Canadian health consumers and business
 people are counting on you to personally voice your objection, and to
 make sure the Canadian Codex delegates show their disapproval. I also
 request that you write to tell me exactly what you intend to do to
 rectify this problem.

 Signed,

Just wanted to mention that I wrote a computer program to do something
like that--although without the Nepalese prayer wheel idea.

I wrote a program that generated syntactic structures that were correct
grammatically and then took words from a list that showed the part of
speech of the word but nothing else.  So the program generated randomly
varying sentence structures without reference to any word meaning.

The results were quite interesting, in that the resulting poems (or prose)
made connections of words and phrases that I think would otherwise never
occur.  The underlying syntactic "sense" made the poems seem meaningful,
while still random and quite unusual in terms of combining particular
words.

I showed a few copies of the computer-generated work around San Francisco
in 1974-75, entitled "Social Climax Text" and "Ideas Imagine Passion."

I'm also thinking about trying to publish the results along with an
explanatory essay (although previous efforts didn't work).

Backchannel me for an example, if you anyone is interested.

one?). People express themselves, people are receptive. Some of that
expression and reception we call art, and some we don't. A Cheerios box is
advertizing, not art. It's possible for an impulse to advertize the product
of a multinational grain cionsortium to produce art, but if that happens
it's a secondary purpose. Otherwise the box is a piece of cultural curiosa
and someone will collect it for a museum of cereal.
Some of what's expressed can only be received by an audience that has gone
through a process of education, formally or informally. That's either
because the given expression assumes the knowledge of the language, visual,
verbal or aural, in which it's produced, or because it's built on the
history of similar expressions, or because it requires an extended
attention span. But the reception doesn't end with the acquisition of the
language, history or sitzfleisch. One listens to Mozart, or Melville, or
Stevens, or Rothko, differently, and receives different, perhaps more
complete, information, with repeated listenings. In fact, for some
expressions there is never a point where one is finished hearing it anew or
hearing new things in it.
This continuous meditation on a given expression is a profoundly moving
experience. It seems a shame that the vast bulk of the population is denied
the experience because they lack the education.
Out of that experience come the willingness to fund art institutions that
make the experience possible, and also the formation of more artists who
are invested in the evolving history and practice of their craft and their
culture.

Beyond that, I don't understand your simile. Loving arts=hating medicine.
Does that make sense if reversed: hating medicine=loving arts? how about
hating arts=loving medicine? Is this some sort of stinkbomb or is it meant
to be a more subtle communication?

It seems to me that CAP-L is specifically devoted to Contemporary American
Poets and not to that earlier group of English and American originators and
experimenters.

Also, one of the strengths of CAP-L (again, just a personal opinion) is
that it discusses creative writing: for example, exercises to use in CW
classes, the recent failure to award a Yale Younger Poets prize, and the
length of time journals take to accept or reject poems.

Not so fast there, Young Feller!

Mouth Almighty will indeed be releasing "Closed on Account of Rabies: Poems
and Tales of Edgar Allan Poe" on December 9, just in time to answer your
Holiday giftgiving ache. Produced by the mighty Hal Willner, audacious cover
art by Ralph Steadman, and liner notes by Charles Baudelaire ("Each morning I
pray to God and Poe"), some of the highlights include: Dr. John rumbling
through French/Latin/Creole-limned English to bring to life the unstable
narrtaor of the little-known Bereneice; Diamanda Gallas cackling through "The
Black Cat"; Ed Sanders singing two poems with full band; Christopher Walken
spookifying "The Raven" only to be sent up by a crazed Abel Ferrar trying to
do the same thing; Gabriel Byrne between the thunderclaps of "Masque of Red
Death"; Jeff Buckley, Marianne Faithfull, and others.

This will be MA's first entry into the audio book zone. Also available as a
double CD. Orders via website (Poe page will go up end of Nov)

Joseph, as a hand-drummer (African/Cuban/Haitian folkloric styles, etc.),
that book might just be the answer to a previously unfulfilled quest to
understand better our affinities with rhythm.  Thanks for that comment.  As
to how applicable his theories are to poetry, or how well-supported they are,
I guess I'm gonna have to find out for myself.  I'm not (currently)
super-interested in formal poetry, and never have been, but I leave no stone
unturned in my investigations to understand all I can.

I think it's a three second, not three minute, line buffer.  That'd be a
long line.

I don't doubt the usefulness of neurobiology for studying rhythm or any
other aspect of poetry or poetic form.  (I used to be managing editor of
_The Journal of Neuroscience_ and I currently teach in an special program
combining neurobiology, philosophy of mind, cognitive anthropology, clinical
psychology, and cognitive linguistics; so I'm a pretty big fan of the
neurosciences.)

Rhythm is biological, cognitive, cultural, and sociopolitical, yes: but the
stupidity of Turner's essay is in its prescriptive project, an a priori
description of rhythm in terms that lead directly to the New Formalism.  How
handy.  It is a perfect example of what B. H. Smith, following Pierre
Bourdieu, has called "the Others' Poison Effect": what is bad for you must
be bad for others.  Subsuming meter to neural firings (and secondarily to
breath and heartbeat, in a bizarre anti-Olson riff) for Turner means in the
end that metered poetry is healthy and free verse neither healthy nor, as he
says in a footnote somewhere, even really poetry.  But if so, how come what
would give Turner a heart attack really makes me groove?  Good Doc Turner
wants to give me a poetic pacemaker; says I've got me a baaaad ticker.

Ah, we do. Contemporary culture has succeeded in making the public private

                Great. There must be a shared idea of culture there, however, and of
                its value. Not a universal situation. Building that might be the first
                step.

        Teach them what?

        Change the culture of the teacher's lounge? Only, I suspect, if art
        becomes a project rather than a history. Otherwise it will be swallowed.

>As to what kind of art, what aesthetic experience is opened, I'd be
content
>to define it as whatever they have no access to now, and that means those
>arts that require a vocabulary, verbal, visual or musical, and some

        Teaching arts as languages is valuable. But isn't the first step one of
connections? Beethoven is valuable today because Glass (for example) is
carrying on the tradition. The traditions and histories exist, no matter
        where you enter them. Is it possible to change a culture without first
        changing the culture of delivery?

>And I'm pretty unashamedly elitist about this. I don't think it
>reactionary to want more people to be capable of experiencing some of the
>more powerful experiences that human culture has generated.

        But what are those experiences? Creation or education? I'd want to teach
        that the tradition is alive, here, now, in all the mundane and glorious
        parts of everyday life and perception. That's where history has brought
        us, that's where history _is._ Then we can talk about individual
        instances of creation, Brueghel or Bach or Williams or Marlowe.

         The alternative is to fall into pc land, where Plato is dismissed as a
        dead white male, end of story, because the connections of history to life
        are not brought to life by any form of education that is not essentially
        creative. Plato is dead, white, and male, but that is not the end of the
        story.

        Is it really elitism you want, or excellence? Access you mentioned.

        I think you must mean excellence.

        Which do they mean in Wupperthal? Why are the Wupperthalers trudging
        off to the Tanztheater? Is it because Art is a social project in Germany?
        Is it because they want to be educated? Is it because they recognize
        excellence in art and want to support it? I ask, because if we are going
        to translate this success into a North American context, and committing
         our meagre arts funding to it, we had better be very sure just what it is

        we are bringing across the Atlantic. We had better be very sure that we
        are bringing all the pieces along. I don't have any answers here. Maybe
        your sources do. I'd love to hear them.

Whatcha think?

Cheers,

Harold

       Henry:
         I've taught at three secondary schools over the last ten years. I
have yet to cross paths with any NEA money or with anyone who has been
rewarded NEA money. Does this mean those who receive do not also give? I'm
out here wondering wherefore they art be. I get poets into the classroom as
often as I can -- I've had Jack Foley, Larry Eigner, and others -- but they
have been funded by scant school monies.
        Is/Was poets-in-the-schools active? Are/Were they NEA funded? As I
began teaching at the end of the Reagan debacle, I heard good things about
this program but I couldn't catch the ghost.
        In any case, my experience tells me the best way to show students
age 13-18 that poetry is alive is to bring living poets to their classroom
doorstep to read and talk. Anyone coming through Moscow, ID in the the next
ten years? Give me a call.

Dear Listfreaks,
before the synapses mufflerize for the night, here's a miniscule report on
Susan Wheeler's poetry reading at Brown Univ. s'evening:

Susan Wheeler's poetry is a kind of pure poetry.  For Me this doesn't Imply
Political Purity or Experimental Sainthood; rather the ironic double of the
one and the opposite of the other.  She caroms harmonious otherness of
traditional poetry (Auden, Poe, Heine, Shakespea, Felix the cat) - in all its
MILTONIC ORGAN-MUSIC of rhyme, assonance, diction, vastness, virginal limnation
 - honing that framing marrow - without any academic fat.  There's a razor
(ironic, platinum) wobbling between Art & Life; and the goats will
be left bad-breathin in the Wheelesque-Miltonic outer darkness - the great
Wheel of Heel of EloHim - while Sheep & Sheepdog enjoy
the Rewording.  Got that, everybody?  Make a lot of sense?  Good.
If the Wheeler Circus come to town (book due this spring)
I recommend be there if you can.  - Henry in an UnExceptionally
InArticulate State

p.s. I is makin sophumeric remarks about a poet who
branches into strange redemptive glories of adverse occasions
(if you know what I mean). Commentary, midrashim, corrections, anybody.

about those Lewis MacAdams/Tom Clark collaborations, as well as the
Lewis-Lewis (MacAdams/Warsh) and their ursprung in the Berrigan/Padgett
Bean Spasms, what does the list think

after 25-30 years

about the aesthetic value of these efforts, and whether they have now
stood the test of time?

Or collaborations in general, e.g., I consider A Nest of Ninnies to be
entirely successful, but when I turn to Journey to A War, I seem to be
reading prose by Isherwood with interspersed poems by Auden, i.e., not a
genuinely compositional collaboration.  (But lets not get into renga.)

And my profound apologies for mis-identifying Langston Hughes, a far
better poet than Sylvia Plath's ex-husband for sure.

There are a number of poets-in-the schools programs active in the US. I
work for Teachers & Writers Collaborative, the main writers-in-residence
program in New York. Coincidentally, we sponsored a project a few years
back in Salmon, Idaho; NEA recipients Jack Collom and Sheryl Noethe were
the poet-teachers. They taught the whole town. They wrote a book about it,
_Poetry Everywhere_, which you can order from me by calling
1-888-BOOKS-TW. T&W gets money from the NEA (in fact, the Poetry City
reading series was subsidized by the NEA up through this past June). The
restructuring of the NEA set up a funding category for Arts-in-Education.
I don't know whether groups like California Poets-in-the-Schools,
JustBuffalo, Houston Writers-in-the-Schools, COMPAS (a
writers-in-residence program based in Minneapolis) or WritersCorps (a
national writers-in-residence initiative, I think they call it) get

PS Can anybody confirm or deny Jack Collom's authorship of the spam haiku
that are circling the internet chain? "Angioplasty" was the word that made
me think I was certain he wrote them (and that they were the poems the
Star or the Enquirer went after in their 'Poet Receives $40,000 of your
Tax Dollars to Pen Ditties About Spam' article, the source of most of the
last congressional mooting of the NEA's right-to-life). Seems like he
ought to get credit, if not royalties.

No, Glass does not inform the appreciation of nor influence the survival of
Beethoven. The late quartets, the last three piano sonatas and the diabelli
variations have a lot more to do with it, and I'd guess that the vast
majority of those who learn from Beethoven are only dimly aware of Glass.
But that's rather beside the point. I think you're contending that only
those who make art can teach it, and only teaching the making can imbue the
love of same. If that were true there'd be a very small audience. Myself, I
barely whistle, and barely scribble, but I think I've managed to turn on
more than a few to musical and visual thought--and the examplary passion is
a large part of the persuasion. Some of those so persuaded, given the luck
and talent, will make new things themselves. Others will value what's made
and lead richer lives for the time given.
Here's an experience. I left a museum where I had just spent some time with
Breughel's Hunters in the Snow. Outside it was late afternoon. The ground
was covered with snow and the bare trees were black against it. Suddenly
the landscape was collapsed into Breughel's perspective and resolved into
the complex ordering of the painting, but at the same time I was aware of
the palpable world. I was understanding the way that Breughel had perceived
and ordered without relinquishing my habitual perception and ordering, the
one informing the other. It was an electrifying moment, another possibility
for how to navigate in the world that had been presented. This was an
ecstatic moment, and such moments do change one's life. And the ability to
experience such moments, to increase the capacity for conceiving and
perceiving in a more complex manner is what I try to teach.
I think there are political consequences. Such moments release one from
preconceptions. And that makes change possible. This is a neutral fact--the
capacity for change is amoral. But it can lead to more fully experienced
life, and to the making of art.

The Pina Bausch company (the Wupperthaler crowd) tour. They play New York
and I think several other American cities and all major cities in Europe I
think every year. If you saw their work I think your questions about why
people attend would be answered. It's a pretty amazing experience.

Philly Talks is both an event & a web/hard copy newsletter. The newsletter
presents brief written responses by two poets, each to the other's
work/context. The event extends those responses in dialogue, after
readings by the poets. Available so far:

Philly Talks #1 (Oct. 30 & 31, 1997):
David Bromige (response to Moriarty's *Symmetry* [Avec Books])
Laura Moriarty (response to Bromige's *A Cast of Tens* [Avec Books])

Philly Talks #2 (Nov. 4 & 5, 1997):
Andrew Levy (response to Mac Low's *Barnesbook* [Sun & Moon])
Jackson Mac Low (response to *Continuous/Discontinuous* [Potes & Poets])

Philly Talks #1 is temporarily lodged at:
http://dept.english.upenn.edu/~wh/events/phillytalks1.html
#2 will be up shortly.

Hard copies of both newsletters are available for the grand total of
$US 1 by emailing your request to wh@dept.english.upenn.edu

The series is curated/edited by Louis Cabri and made possible thanks to
Kelly Writers House and University of Pennsylvania.

LEFT HAND BOOKS announces the publication of FOUNDATIONS by James Walsh.
128 pages + four-color insert; paper; $15.00

  FOUNDATIONS documents James Walsh's wall-hung and site/non-site specific
sculptures executed in various materials: mud, seed cones, leaves, plastic
tubes, chalk, mason's line, bricks and stones. These rectangular forms
evoke building foundations and what Robert Smithson termed "ruins in
reverse, that is-all the new construction that would eventually be built."
  Each foundation Walsh made "is a simple rearranging of the site." His
text mirrors his off-hand style of sculpting and calls for the same
"diffuse attention." The writing's open framework corresponds to the
notions of containment and dispersal embodied by the foundations. Walsh
scatters passages from different writers and artists across the reader's
field of attention, interspersing them with autobiographical passages,
proposals for new sculptures-Foundation on the Surface of the Moon, for
example-and commentary on his own and other artists' work. He writes: "My
interests are diffuse and can be drawn out and elaborated, but not at the
expense of their sometimes fragile, tenuous connections."
  This copiously illustrated book contains maps to most of the foundations
Walsh made. Walsh's text is itself a map, siting his foundations both
within his personal history and the history of culture. Walsh links his
work to both ancient and modern contexts, revealing how his minimalist work
connects to the Nazca lines and 20th century land art. His sculpture's
flatness aligns it to drawing; and he describes Walter de Maria's Half Mile
Long Drawing in the Mohave Desert as having "the relationship to landscape
I've been thinking of: minimal marking, defining and condensing interior
space, drawing in and focusing exterior space, a way of organizing the
landscape."

In my opinion, it ain't held sacred by all.....that's why we need a
radical overhaul of the values and perceptions our society is founded on.
(I refer to it "the old fashioned way"--as revolution.)

Brent--

If you've got somethin' to say about Merwin or the Waldrops, why not post
it (even if it's not as thoroughly worked-out as an essay you'd
publish...even if it's somewhat off the top of yer head??)

The best way to get things going in the direction you want, on the list
(as I've discovered from experience) is to just start yattering along the
lines you'd like people to pursue...I dare say you'll find more Waldrop
fans than Merwin fans on this list (??but I may be guessing wrong) and
that a substantial number of folks who like one don't like the other.

But it's opinion that make the poet-races....

Well, Joe, I only walked in on the last 15 minutes of the latest Burns paean
to American mythology, but I found it rather treacly and distasteful. But
then, I'd just spent the previous two hours reading Said's _Culture and
Imperialism_, so that's understandable.

Several things occured to me though - if I see/hear  Stephen Ambrose and his
gravel mixer voice trotted out one more time in defense of Ike, Lewis &
Clark or any other  icons or shibboleths of American identity
formation/essentialism I'm going to puke. And where were the possibly
dissenting or at least more critical voices among Western historians - Patty
Limerick, Don Worster or Richard Slotkin - didn't see their names in the
title crawl.

A few years back someone (Hodding Carter?) wrote an amusing little book
about retracing L & C's path - impossible now of course. You can't even sail
a small boat up the Mississippi thanks to all the commerce and the
regulatory devices installed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Missouri
itself is dammed in so many places  - for recreational lakes and power
supply - that it's also unnavigable.

And as for Thom. Jefferson's "vision" of the West: one can do some very
instructive reading about that vision in his letters (in the Library of
America edition) where he outlines his policy for divesting Native Americans
of their land holdings via unscrupulous lending practices and foreclosure.
Oh yeah - he was all over that vision thing baby.
______
Jordan - to my knowledge, Jack Collom doesn't dabble on the Net. But his
partner Jennifer Heath may have done so. Those haiku _do_ have a Collomesque
touch, don't they? I think I saw can of Spam in Jack's kitchen once.
Coincidence - or something else?

Re: David Benedetti poem-making program -- check out Charles O Hartman's book
"Vitual Muse," from last year (Wesleyan UP), where various such programs are
described & some of their texts displayed.  The poems are not all that strong,
frankly, but they do belong to recognizable types of contemporary poetry, which
I think is interesting.  Hartman's reflections on his experience with these pro
grams are also interesting -- not profound, but a place to start.

Somebody asked, why not discuss W. S. Merwin.  A contributor's note on him
in Hawaii Review once said, "W. S. Merwin is W. S. Merwin." Period. So
everybody as it were recognizes the style, stance, voice.  Oppen called
this, caustically, "the Merwin," meaning that Merwin's poetry had at some
point reified into a market position, a period style magazine diction, all
experimentation and risk-- at some point-- over. I believe sadly this is
so. The voice is desiccated, burnt out, having written the
subjectivity/self out as a source of wisdom or anything else. His turning
belatedly to Hawaiian materials only reeks of his latest imperial gesture,
sad, appropriative, it does belong in there with the furniture ads of the
New Yorker or the perfumes of a US selfhood converted to Shelley pose.
Sad.
Invidious comparison number two:  Robert Creeley gave a reading in Santa
Cruz yesterday to a packed house of 300 at Kresgee Town Hall, UCSC. Peter
Gizz introduced him elegantly, referring to his life project of language
invention, the new englandy economy of phrasing, the recoding via new
contexts of words like 'hello' until even these became odd, perverse.
Creeley read and talked around the body of his life work.  The last poem
he read was a long one and on the border-of-death masterpiece, called
"Histoire de Florida" in which the tropes and twists of his whole life's
writing project is recall as la "Ashphodel that Greeny Flower," but oddly
the voice and figure of sublime influence that returns to haunt the pome
is Wallace Stevens. Creely talked for about fifteen mintues afterwards
about what Stevens meant tohim, how hw was his first love as a poet but
that the WS long line was not rright for him so he turned to the taut
economy of WSW and weirded that out into the necessary prosody of his
life. Pretty amazing event.  Many who left the audience were grateful for
his work, for him, as Paul Bove was said "this is a great man on the
earth." There is no such thing as "the Creeley" and never will be. Honor
is indeed due. The amazing coming to terms with his body and vision at all
points of exactitude. Rob Wilson

The National Enquirer reported recently that Creeley (or "HM RC") was born
of a Virgin by syllabic conception & that his one eye is actually a
perfect heptapodromic crystal from the planet Jupiter; unknown to many,
he's also the inventor of a method of syntactic swimming called "the
Creeley".  - Henry Gould

Mark,

What I had in mind was not the integrity of either Beethoven or Glass, and
the same follows for Pope or Wordsworth or cummings. I find a vast
difference between listening to Beethoven out of his cultural context and
Glass within his. Beethoven is meaningful to me because his work is still
being carried on. There are (at least!) two ways of approaching the
tradition of art or poetics: 1) there is a canon of achievement which we
can celebrate and learn from, and 2) there is a tradition of creation which
gave rise to that canon and which is ongoing. We can approach the act of
art through 1 or 2, but there is a cost to both. My bias is with 2. Yours
appears to be with 1. I think if students are going to some day be true
writers or readers, we need to incorporate both approaches. At the very
least, whatever approach we choose contains its own hidden biases. They may
be the strongest of all. This goes for Pina Bausch's company, too. Whatever
the attractions of her art, it is still created in a context. I'd like to
be clear on that context before I re-created the art, or we will actually
be re-creating something entirely different, perhaps merely our own biases.
Some translation is probably necessary. The whole point was that we should
be clear what we are doing when we spend our meagre resources so that we
can get the most from the least. If money is really tight, then I feel we
need to spend it wherever it can start a momentum of its own. Ah, heck,
that's probably what you meant, too.

Best,

Harold Rhenisch

No, Glass does not inform the appreciation of nor influence the survival of

majority of those who learn from Beethoven are only dimly aware of Glass.
But that's rather beside the point. I think you're contending that only
those who make art can teach it, and only teaching the making can imbue the
love of same. If that were true there'd be a very small audience. Myself, I
barely whistle, and barely scribble, but I think I've managed to turn on
more than a few to musical and visual thought--and the examplary passion is
a large part of the persuasion. Some of those so persuaded, given the luck
and talent, will make new things themselves. Others will value what's made
and lead richer lives for the time given.

How you can group Merwin into a place along with the "perfume ads  of the
New Yorker" is beyond me.  I for one am grateful for Merwin's approach and
style, and feel it is still a valid and much-needed break from the typical
mental-masturbation approach that many "contemporary" poets seem to fall in
to, especially after being embraced by academia.
A vague use of language does not a poet make, and Merwin has avoided this
since the appearance of "The Carrier of Ladders" in 1973.

And please explain the connection you were trying to make between your
comments on Merwin and your praise of Creeley.  Creeley is an excellent
writer, but I fail to see the point in bringing him into the conversation,
especially since I see no corrolation between his style of writing and
Merwin's.

A general query to the list...

What is/are the best sources for purchasing poetry on tape and CD??

For many years I was on the mailing list of a company called Poets Audio
Center, whose catalog rounded up everything they handled, whic h was a
reasonable range of stuff..Mostly contemporary but also people reading
Shakespeare, Chaucer, Shelley etc. If there were never too many items
radically outside the academic mainstream, I figured that was because
there weren't that many available--certainly not as well-distributed as
things by Caedmon and the like...

What I'm trying to track down is a source that (like the PAC to some
extent did) can be a source for finding out what's commercially available,
in the first place, as well as for ordering.  As a library acquisitions
person, my skills and tools are all about traking down this kind of
info...And at the moment I can't find much.  I would guess that the Poets
Audio Center is kaput, as I can find so little trace of 'em.

thanx,
Mark P.

I think except for the valuation of Glass we're in agreement. Cats is
probably better art than glass. There. I've waved a red flag.

When I think of Merwin, the word "attentuated" comes to mind. It seems to me
his work once inhabited a fairly vital sphere of language - but he staked
everything, as it were, on a longing for the sublime -  a sublime that
required no real sacrifice on his part, a sublime that was mostly notable
for the pretty clothes and miming of transcendence he decked it out in ala a
cut rate Wallace Stevens - and it seems to me he's lost that wager.

Rob cites Merwin's appropriation of Hawaii as a trope of rejuvenation and
this too feels like a move borne from desperation.  Appropriation of course
is fine all of itself. But in Merwin's more recent work it feels all very
thin and transparent, all very achey-breaky with sincerity, with a jesting
about wounds that never felt the scars. I can no longer read either _The
Lice_ nor _Carriers_ with any enjoyment - works which 10 years ago animated
me. There was one poem in _Vixen_ - "Substance" I think it was - which I
thought was pretty good - that is, I thought he'd managed for once not to
box himself in with Merwinisms - his ardent dying falls and metaphysical
nostalgias. Or rather, he gathered these concerns up very tightly and
overcame their specific limitations.

I'd also second Rob's contention that Creeley's "Histoire du Florida" (not
the correct "Floride" as RC defiantly noted last spring here in Boulder) is
a bloody wonderful poem.

You can go to Hartman's web page (http://www.conncoll.edu/ccother/cohar/)
and download one of his programs (MacProse, a text generator for
Macintosh).  It'll generate things like this: "Where we were theories, the
equation--ice--was the library."  It'll generate one at a time, or
continuously (very quickly in fact, until you click). An interesting and
useful tool, with some obvious limitations if you use for awhile (certain
grammatical constructions tend to recur with peculiar frequency . . .the
source code is included, so I suppose one could edit it)

Another book if interest might be Amittai Aviram's *Telling Rhythm: Body

I heartily agree with this assessment. Turner tends to uncomplicate,
for instance, the political implications of rhythm. Rhythm for him
seems perfectly liberatory, necessarily democratic and therefore "Good."
But, as I'm sure you can speak to better than I can, different paced
rhythms tend to have different physical effects. Slower rhythms can lull
us to sleep, and, if paced too fast, a rhythm can lead to anarchic
madness. Sleep and madness ain't too liberatory to me.

Yet, while I agree with you, I seem to have found few others who even try
to join the discussion of poetic meter and psychobiology at all. Do you
have any suggestions on where to find more adequate discussions of the
intersection of the two, poetic rhythm and neuroscience? I've turned up
interesting research on music and neuroscience, but little on poetry.

Just to let you know--not only was Rosmarie Waldrop's reading last night =
wonderful, but Jacques Roubaud was quite a kick too! Hopefully one is =

I have been thinking about the idea of other discussion lists this =
morning,
and am wondering why there are no discussions on some of the other
contemporary poets that are around these days.  I never hear anything on
Merwin (a personal favorite of mine) or Levertov or other writers like
that. I saw a posting today announcing Rosmarie Waldrop's upcoming =
reading
tonight, but she and her work are never discussed here, either, and that =
is
a shame.  She and her husband are both amazing poets. I certainly don't =
see
myself as being attracted to only one or two "styles" of poetry, and =
would
really like to see a broad range of writers and styles addressed.
What do some of you think?  Is there a call to pursue this?

Here's a couple of stories from two classes that I taught in Tucson. Call
them extensions of and partial correctives to your data.

I arrived in Tucson on the eve of the Gulf War. In all that patriotic
frenzy I decided to ask my Freshman Comp students to write about the crisis
from Saddam Hussein's point of view. None of them would do it--they thought
that even entertaining the fantasy was unpatriotic. Half of them
transferred out of my class, which wasn't such a bad thing--it actually
made it possible for me to teach the remnant.

Of those left about a third were hispanic, and all professed to be
Christians. Before Easter I suggested that some of them might like to go to
Old Pascua, a tiny Yaqui reservation surrounded by Tucson, to see the
half-pagan ceremonies, at which point my brightest student raised his hand
and asked, "Mark, what's Easter about?"

When I was able to get my mouth working again I determined that he wasn't
putting me on, and I asked the class which of them knew that Easter was a
celebration of the crucifiction and resurrection of Christ. Only the
hispanic kids raised their hands. In the ensuing discussion I learned that
for the other kids Easter had always been a secular holiday for Christian
children, involving bunnies and chocolate.

During my second year in Tucson I taught an American lit course. I had the
kids read a rather floridly Calvinist captivity narrative. What they found
most exotic about it was the brand of Christianity. To a man or woman they
professed membership in radical Protestant sects, but they didn't recognize
the protagonist as a coreligionist. They all believed in god, virgin birth,
baby Jesus and heaven, but they didn't believe in hell and had never heard
of original sin.

This same group, when I polled them when we were reading Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas (it was an interesting, not to say eccentric, syllabus),
admitted, with two exceptions, to smoking pot, and with three exceptions,
to snorting coke.

So maybe the defensiveness about their religion, and the bigotry, remain,
but not much else. Those kids who carried their bibles nonetheless had to
check before answering even the simplest questions, after all. And maybe
all those surveys that purport to tell us that Americans are the most
religious people on earth, greatly comforting the Christian Coalition, ask
the wrong questions. Apparently it's the Disney version, not the King
James, that the kids and their elders are reading.

Is that a hopeful thought?

Modernism is often a very lively list, but it is not all poetry.  It is
useful for those of us interested in interdisciplinary issues, as it often
includes art, music, politics, etc.

mainstream website effectively does not exist at present

relaunch has been delayed

you can still reach my old site on Compuserve but that is because
compuserve will not close it despite having had money taken back from them
by visa

apologies for confusion and still more for non availability - it will be
launched againas soon as it is possible to do so probably on a _global_
server

Right....
I'm precisely looking for an operation that can provide info about
recordings from a wide range of sources.  Most easily-contacted outfits
like the AAP offer only one very narrow definition of poetry (and it
ain't, to put it mildly, mine!!)

Ok, so how about discussing C.D. Wright's most recent book of poetry,
"Tremble".  For those of you who have read it, I must say that it is one of
the most well-crafted and beautiful collections i have read in quite a
while.  Far different from some of her other books (i.e. String Light,
Translation of the Gospels Back Into Tongues, etc.), she really paid
attention to the details of craft and cadence.  I saw her read in Cambridge
with Paul Hoover a few weeks ago,
and it was delightful.  She also read from a new work which will be
published by New Directions in 1998.  Also, her husband, Forrest Gander,
has a new book coming out in April, and he, too, is a fine writer.

Might also check with Bob Holman from Mouth Almighty Records.  As you will
recall, Bob is the genius who did the United States of Poetry and probably
would have some good info. for you.

To simply reject Frederick Turner's work as stupid is to dismiss some of
the most important thinking being done today concerning the place of
poetry in the world.  While I agree that in the essay "The Neural Lyre"
Turner can justifiably be accused of a certain amount of scientific
reductionism, his work overall is perhaps the most interesting
contemporary attempt to understand poetry as a universal human endeavor.
I'm with Joseph Tate here, neurobiology does have some vital things to say
about "what poetry is for."  Turner's stance, at its heart is quite simple
(see his book Natural Classicism for its most straight-forward
elucidation): the roots of literature are in ritual performance and that,
in turn, is rooted in our biological, evolutionary  inheritance.
        Turner (incidentally, the son of the anthropologist Victor Turner)
is the leading light of the New Formalist movement, with their evil
agenda--defending narrative, rhyme and meter--and his poetic work, I
think, will not appeal to many on this list, but I think it unwise to
cursorily dismiss his writing.  Turner is dealing with some vital and
elementary questions in some surprisingly synthetic ways and, agree or
disagree, some familiarity with his work is bound to deepen one's attempts
to place the poetic impulse within the larger human endeavor.  While I
don't necessarily agree with Turner on his conclusions that current
research justifies the type of closed structure he advocates, I have found
his work, at the very least, a healthful corrective to some of the
deadening and dysfunctional theory that currently bogs down contemporary
work.

Mark, There is a source of tape recordings of various poets, writers, and
others (Noam Chomsky for example) with an outfit called Audio Forum. They claim
to have 4,000 titles. They may also be able to point to other sources or
listings. Hope this helps.

Generally, I'd have to side with Patrick Pritchett on this one, although I
do like a lot of his translations. But I went after a lot of the early
poetry, read it, & then put it away. In regard to Creeley, whose work I
return to all the time, I just am not called back to the Merwin. Except for
one book, published outside his usual venues, by the late lamented North
Point, _Finding the Islands_, which was something of a formal move for him
as well. Not 'great' but certainly of interest to this reader...

Interesting post, Tim. I'm by no means convinced however that poetry is
_for_ anything, as you put it. For as soon as it's for something, it's also
not for something else. In a word, this description smacks of the
utilitarian. As Stephen Rodefer put it (quoted from Mark Prejsnar's latest
ish of Misc. Proj) "It's not the business of poetry to be anything."

I haven't read "The Neural Lyre," but from your account Turner appears to be
falling into the old nostalgia of the arts to locate its roots in the
empirical. I don't why people still fall prey to this anxiety - this desire
to locate roots as though the biological of itself can confer legitimacy,
can alleviate the angst which poetry suffers whenever it compares itself to
the sciences. Isn't it enough to say that poetry is a cultural product? That
whatever dim primeval impulse first stimulated its rudimentary expressions
that by now - several millennia later - poetry is a cultural construction
and requires no further justification than that? As if it needed any in the
first place.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Douglas Barbour was correct in stating that _Finding the Islands_ was a
formal move for Merwin, but I only brought him up in the first place to
celebrate some of his less-formal ventures.  In _The Carrier of Ladders_
two poems in particular come to mind: "Little Horse", and "When You Go
Away", which are both fine examples of an individual being in touch with
emotion without it being so flowery or formal as to be boring.  My main
complaint with "contemporary" poetry these days is it can be very detached,
especially when dealing with matters of human emotion.  Although Merwin
could indeed be seen as guilty of playing on the same theme from time to
time, it is a theme he has (in my humble opinion) mastered.... and if it
ain't broken, don't fix it.

I also feel (as I stated in an earlier post) that C.D. Wright is another
fine poet whose work goes too often unnoticed or unmentioned on this list.
I read lots of posts about Robert Creeley (whom I admire greatly), but
there are other greats besides him.  I can't just return to him and say,
"Well, obviously everything this man says is a pearl, so this is who I am
going to give my focus to".  My idea of poetry is not that narrow.  I would
really like to see this list encompass a broader range of poets and their
work to discuss.  We owe that to ourselves and to people who turn to this
fine list as a source for keeping up with what is going on in poetry these
days.

Natch to context. Try Boulez or, for quartets, Carter. And the first half
of this century is incredibly rich in string quartets--better known than
those since because they've had time to enter the repertory. Schoenberg,
Webern, Volpe, Ives, Sibelius, Bartok, Debussy, Ravel, Shostakovich, to
name a few of several different persuasions in no particular order. A
listen in order to all the Bartok quartets or all the Carters after the
first is a rewarding, exhausting experience.

I probably meant Alex Katz. (Alley Cats?)

Here's a thought:
Because the language of music has changed so much across time I probably
need something more by way of preparation to listen to, say, the opus 111
sonata or the Art of the Fugue than just my availability. That given, I'd
usually like to hear them in as deep a solitude as possible, which
recordings makes possible. Hearing the lines of dialogue between different
compositions is one way to listen (like hearing the echoes in Pound?), but
the work also exists as a dialogue between me as listener and the achieved
thought of the maker, and that's also a good way to listen. Fortunately,
one doesn't have to choose.

I agree with Douglas Barbour about _Finding the Islands_. I also suspect
there are formal possibilities there still untapped, a kind of sliding
scale of consciousness, as in Riley's "In C", but gentler, less ecstatic. I
still read books like _The Carrier of Ladders_ and _Writings to an
Unfinished Accompaniment_ for the carved interaction between title and
poem. The later books of poems and that prose book on Provence I wish I
hadn't bought and which I never finished, though, are flat for me. I read
_The Vixen_ a while back. The whole time, I found I was not reading the
poems Merwin had set down, but different possibilities for the poems,
reading completely against his lineation and rhythms, which seem horribly
botched, as if he had just started the poems and then quit, forgetting to
make any kind of shape or terseness. Curiously, I still can't make myself
read them as he set them down. Something could be made out of that stuff.
Maybe with a knife and a pot of glue.

Someone else said that Frost was a second-rate versifier, too. That's a
little harsh, isn't it? My take is that he wrote about nine solid poems. As
for the rest of them, well, there are very few poets who've written more
good ones than that. There are only a half dozen Brecht pieces that seem
worth returning to. Same for Merwin, perhaps. Let's not beat the guy up too
much for that. This gets back to something I harped upon a while back: the
need for a new assessment of twentieth century literature. What we have at
the moment is a canon consisting of poems and movements defined as they
arose. Exciting, sure, but now that we have a little distance we should be
able to do a little cross-border shopping, placing things in larger
perspectives, stuffing _Finding the Islands_ in with Pound's ballads, for
instance, just to see if they can get along for an afternoon coffee.

Probably have to carry passports and pay some kind of duty, though. Rough.

Probably wind up drinking tea out of tuna tins behind the piano.

Maybe the reason some poets & critics turn to science in thinking about
poetry is that it's a way to finesse the raw/cooked or wild/cultured
dichotomies.  As usual, I'm thinking of Mandelstam & his fascination
with biology, mineralogy, & mathematics (which goes for Celan, for another).
M's use of biological vocabulary to describe the metamorphoses of imagery
in Dante, for example; or his poem about Lamarck the evolutionist in
scientific/Dantesque combination.  What scientific frameworks does is create
a space in which the genuine novelty of the "wild" [i.e., as Mandelstam
wrote somewhere, "Poetry is language in a state infinitely more raw
than prose or everyday speech"] can be "boxed" in a highly refined
intellectual-cultural framework (science) - and at the same time,
science in turn is "framed" by the wildness of poetry.
   Another major motive for Mandelstam here was his connection with
romanticism & 19th-century Russian poetry. His friendship with
professional naturalists was both an acmeist "kinship with the earth"
& earthly things and also a sphere of personal & intellectual freedom
(relatively speaking) from ideology. That's my Mandelstam lecture for
this week.  Science (pace Sokal-haters) like music is a stab at a
universal language. - Henry Gould

Yes, even if one has diverged from road taken by Frost in American
poetry, one would have to give him his due as a first-rate versifier--or
better said, highly-accomplished within formal constraints. Also, as
Randall Jarrell ably pointed out in his essay "The other Frost," there
is a very different poet behind poems like Directive, Neither Out Far
Nor In Deep, An Old Man's Winter Night, etc --different from The Road
Not Taken, (a swinger of) Birches, etc. To quote Jarrell, "These views
of Frost come either from not knowing the poems well enough or
knowing the wrong poems too well."

Tim, read my post: I didn't dismiss all of Turner's work as stupid; I only
dismissed "The Neural Lyre," called his epic poems "repulsive" to my taste,
and complimented his understanding of chaos theory.

Nor do I mind defenses of rhyme and meter, although I do object to
dismissals of unmetered forms as NOT POETRY (as Turner essentially did in a
footnote to "Neural Lyre").

And as I said, I don't dismiss a neurobiological framework by any means.

I'm in agreement with Patrick Pritchett's view that to say poetry is "for"
something is deeply problematic.  However, I wouldn't call it utilitarian;
I'd call it adaptationist, or, to use Stephen J. Gould's phrase, a variant
of "Darwinian fundamentalism."  Tim, your description of Turner's project
seems to align Turner with evolutionary psychology, a speculative collection
of 'just-so' stories exemplified by the likes of Steven Pinker, who was
throttled by Gould in a recent exchange in the New York Review of Books.

Explanations of poetry in evolutionary terms, in addition to being likely
composed of fantasy and confabulation, can tell us nothing about
contemporary possibilities even if they're completely accurate.  And they
certainly cannot prescribe what is good or bad in current poetry, since the
conditions under which poetry is presently composed have little to do with
the ritual performances of furry forbears.

On another note, somebody else on this thread plugged Amittai Aviram's work:
I would also recommend it.   _Telling Rhythm_ is a different kind of
account, one that defends the universality of rhythmic structures in
different (primarily Nietzschean) terms.

Cheers,
David

I remember about 10 years ago Peter Viereck, in an piece published
in Poets & Writers (maybe CODA then), posited that iambic (and
trochaic) meters were often employed by poets because they were
"in sync" with such biological rhythms as the heart’s systole/diastole,
breathing, human locomotion and copulation. (The subtext of the essay
was that regular meter was inherently good because it was natural.)
I didn't think much of his argument since even a casual investigation
of the world’s poetries would show many, many different patterns
prevailing in other countries/cultures outside of the English-speaking
world’s dominant ta-tum, ta-tum, ta-tum…Yet, humans, wherever
they might live on this earth, are quite similar physiologically.
Meter, it seems, must be enculturated or language-bound, and not
a matter of biology—nurture, not nature.

Perhaps I have missed the point implicit in the first post in this thread, but
I'd say that the author of this piece (Michael Quilty) is a card carrying
member of the explorers club who has taken to some old fashioned rural American
and Christian bashing. (I'm glad you find those peculiar creatures so tarty and
crunchy!) I will wait for the next National Geographic where we can expect to
see Michael Quilty like a Jane Goodall afield in the Ozarks in his kahaki and
pith helmut taking notes on barnyard mating habits and woodsy puberty rites. I
don't have to subscribe to a revisionist, maudlin Burnsian view of Americana to
find this piece with its presumptuous style putrid. I realize that many have
arrived here only to find that this country can be a cruel and injust place, a
big joke. But I can't see how Mr.Quilty's harrowing experiences in Arkansas
qualify him for pity. He's just trashing a place (and hell, he still lives
there). Someone elses home and lifestyle.

An easy assumption or expectation of universal agreement (at least in
cosmopolitan company) permeates this cheap shot. I mean, why not look for an
easier target to take out! It is indeed sad that these youngins aren't yet up
to their Christian apologetics. At least Mark Weiss intelligently points up to
the lack somewhat with his reply.

What you remember as a subtext was, in fact, quite explicit, and is, on the
face of it, as you point out, absurd. It also misunderstands formal English
metrics, which is stress-, not quantity-, based, so that all iambs are not
created equal. The febrile poet is perhaps the fibrillating poet. We can
infer other things about Mr. Viereck: he never skips, and he's not very
imaginative in bed.=20

Is this true of all neo-formalists?

Iamb, therefore iamb.

Yes, people respond to rhythm and probably there is a biological basis
for this.  However, this is irrelevant to the assertion that one type of
rhythym is preferrable in any sense, whether that preference is based
scientifically or aesthetically.  Aviram's argument is more sophisticated,
as someone else pointed out.

Brent, I just met C.D. at Bread Loaf in August.  Fascinating woman; handled

 Volunteered to give me a half hour conference, in spite of having a regular

Anyway, I think your point about the contrast between "Tremble" and earlier

This is picked up from the strain on "American-ness" and I can't quite
figure out who wrote it but I'm in total agreement.  The idea that
Americans are the most religious people in the world (you hear it on the
nightly news at least weekly in one form or another) is just plain stupid.
For the huge majority of Americans, including - and perhaps *especially* -
the "very religious" ones, religion is like the key chain that you can get
"personalized" at the mall by having your name engraved on it.  And, as
far as I'm concerned, that's a damn good thing.  So much easier to debunk
rigid collective belief systems, which are always dangerous as such.  If
this means we have to encounter a lot of dopes saying "Jesus loves me,
this I know, 'cause the Bible tells me so," so be it.  I can live with
that.  In fact th basic stance that religion is finally absurdly personal,
has a long and serious intellectual history - it's the history of Puritan
non-conformists like Ann Hutchinson who used the Covenant of Grace to call
into question the communities right to dictate her behavior.  This is the
same history which leads William James to write the brilliant *Varieties
of Religious Experience* (emphasis squarely on variety).  So, as I said,
if this means you have to teach a few adolescent knuckleheads in Arkansas
well, hey, that's the breaks.  Is there *any* teacher on this list
who doesn't have to teach knuckleheads.  Penn, where I'm teaching Freshman
at the moment, is full of 'em.  I feel like part of my job is to
destablize whatever belief system(s) they happen to bring to the table and
I don't mind doing it.  In fact, most of the time its fairly easy, what
with those systems being houses of cards.  When the beliefs are more
firmly held and more thought out, so much the better - then you're into a
discussion with some intellectual teeth.

Ah Merwin.

*Finding the Islands* was my door into Merwin's work -- after
acquainting his name from his renderings of Ghalib (in *Ghazals of
Ghalib*, which also included versions by Rich, Stafford & others).

Regrettably, Merwin himself has seemingly somewhat disowned the book
-- evidently as it was from a phase of love-life that he wants to put
behind him (new woman, new esthetic, so to say) -- he didn't include
any of the *Islands* poems in his Selected poetry, but I note that
lately he has included some of that material in *Flower & Hand*.

Anyway, here's the thing:  Merwin's work at each phase has differed
from prior phases -- there's been a gradual progression from decade
to decade, and someone who acquainted his work only in one period
would be discussing only one section of the broader picture.

As for "the Merwin" or "the Creeley" -- certainly if the first phrase
is meaningful, the 2nd may be equally so.

I was WSM read at the Library of Congress a few weeks ago, first from
material ranging through earlier years, and 2nd from new work yet to
be published.  I enjoyed all of it tremendously -- as I have every
time I've heard this fine man read over the years.

Sorry to see many have not found what I find there.
c'est la vie

To what extent is the response a response to the writing as such, &
to what extent is it a reaction to the 'success story' phenomenon of
a poet who happens to attract a lot of accolades? --

but I've not been reading Poetics thoroughly of late, and so have
missed, I think, some of the Merwin commentary . . . will try to
backtrack --

W.S. Merwin is my favorite poet, I dare say.  What he seeks in the
endeavor of writing is not necessarily different from what others may
seek -- but his manner of approach, and how far it's managed to go
with it, are, for me, in some respects singular.  I don't know that
this is a vew I could cogently defend (at least not today), but it's
nonetheless a response that might interest (if not to say surprise)
some here.

best,

In his book *Travels* -- from a few years ago, Merwin took a major
turn, -- a narrative turn, the poems being almost entirely concerned
with historical figures.

But his latest work (from which he read at the LOC -- to be published
next year) is a single book-length poem based on Hawaiian figures
from, I think, the 19th century.  The passages he read were very fine.

Hello all:

I'm going to announce myself on the list (stepping out from lurker-land)
by arguing with Mike, which is a safe thing to do, given that I can throw
bottles at his windows from here.

Actually, I'm in general agreement with Mike's post, especially when he's
talking about the classroom.  But this extract below strikes me as needing
some modulation:

> This is picked up from the strain on "American-ness" and I can't quite
> figure out who wrote it but I'm in total agreement.  The idea that
> Americans are the most religious people in the world (you hear it on the
> nightly news at least weekly in one form or another) is just plain stupid.
> For the huge majority of Americans, including - and perhaps *especially* -
> the "very religious" ones, religion is like the key chain that you can get
> "personalized" at the mall by having your name engraved on it.  And, as

From my British perspective, the statement "Americans are the most
religious people in the world" may not seem absolutely true (ie, vs.
Israel or Iran, or another theocracy) but it has a certain truth value
that's sociologically important.  What struck me the first time I lived in
Philly was the number of young people I knew who, although they professed
no real, evangelical belief, would attend major religious festivals or
services, and were *extremely* loath to commit to any kind of atheism.
Amongst university students in Britain, this kind of middle-class
religiosity just doesn't occur.

So what, though?

Well, a couple of things.  Firstly, these "key-chain" Christians (or
whatever) aren't dolts, although we might want to see them as
ideologically interpellated/disciplined/constructed (add your fave
theoretical term here).  Secondly, it seems to me that it's exactly the
personalization of religion that goes on in the U.S. that allows it to
survive here in the way it doesn't/hasn't/won't elsewhere.  Mike's aside
on the Puritan tradition seems key here, although I'd go more with Irving
Howe's comments from _Politics and the Novel_ on American individualism
and its relations to politics.  Howe notes that this individualist strain
provokes a paradox between America(n)'s ability to situate themselves on a
micro-political level and their/its corresponding inability to utilise the
macro-political field:

"Personalizing everything, they could not quite do justice to the life of
politics in its own right.... Personalizing everything, they could
brilliantly observe how social and individual experience melt into one
another so that the deformations of the one soon become the deformations
the other."

In a poetics context, the relevant comparison would seem to be between
this religiosity and the spectre of Eng. Lit. departments whihc, despite
their theoretical sophistication, resist writing practices (creative
or critical) which enact this sophistication.

But this is enough for now . . .

The Atlantic's poetry editor reflects on the career of W. S. Merwin, whose
long association with the magazine spans great distances of geography and art

by Peter Davison

August 28, 1997

Over the past twenty-five years the poems of W. S. Merwin have appeared in
The Atlantic Monthly's pages more frequently than those of any other poet.
The editors have been deeply attracted to the vivid movement and activity of
his poetry, which seem to flow up from an underground river that lies beneath
mere speech, as though written in some pre-verbal language of which all later
languages have proved to be a mere translation. Here's a sample from a 1970s
poem called "The Dreamers":

a man with his eyes shut swam upward
through dark water and came to air
it was the horizon
he felt his way along it and it opened
and let the sun out



<Picture: Merwin>Merwin's work has followed his life. Born seventy years ago
in Union City, New Jersey, he was raised first in a Presbyterian rectory
looking across the Hudson toward the towers of New York and then later in
Scranton, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1947 from Princeton University, where
he learned from John Berryman, and set out for Europe to encounter the
Romance languages. During the early 1950s he lived as a translator of Latin,
French, Spanish, and Portuguese on Majorca (where he tutored the children of
the poet Robert Graves) and in Spain, Portugal, and England. He eventually
settled in the south of France and headquartered there during most of the
1960s, though after a time he spent parts of nearly every year in New York.
Later he wandered into Mexico for several years. Since 1975 he has resided in
Hawaii, where he maintains a miniature forest of trees and plants of species
that are threatened elsewhere in the world.

W. S. Merwin
Recent poems from The Atlantic Monthly, with readings by the author recorded
specially for Atlantic Unbound:

Three French Poems:
"Vehicles," "The Speed of Light," and "End of a Day" (September 1994)

"Green Fields"
(February 1995)

Three Poems:
"Another River," "Echoing Light," and "Remembering" (April 1997)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merwin's early poetry was formal and medieval in its overtones, shaded by the
influence of Robert Graves and of the medieval poetry Merwin was translating.
He was awarded the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award in 1952 by W. H. Auden.
In his fourth book, The Drunk in the Furnace (1960), he turned toward
American themes, after spending two years in Boston, where he got to know
Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, Adrienne Rich, Donald Hall, and
other poets who were breaking out of the rhetoric of the 1950s. With The
Moving Target (1963), The Lice (1967), and The Carrier of Ladders (which won
him the Pulitzer Prize in 1970), he began exploring the hazy and animate
forms of poetry for which he is famous. Merwin's poems from here on tend to
escape from punctuation; they search beneath the surfaces of incident and
feeling to the depths of our understanding, a territory of comprehension that
anticipates language, that catches perception at the point where it has not
yet wholly located words, encountering thought and feeling as they hesitate
in the process of formation. In The Carrier of Ladders, for example, the
character of a ladder is taken to reside not only in its rails and rungs but
in the spaces between them, and the poet carrying it takes responsibility for
all the dimensions of a ladder, not only for its character as a climbing
contraption.

<Picture: The Vixen>Merwin's recent poetry, to borrow the words of Robert
Frost, may be thought of as "the tribute of the current to the source."
During the 1980s and 1990s Merwin has gradually allowed his mind and language
(which in a poet are especially hard to separate) to range across the wide
regions of his own reading and travelling, while also plumbing the feelings
and reasonings that arise from his deeply held beliefs. He is not only
profoundly anti-imperialist, pacifist, and environmentalist, but also
possessed by an intimate feeling for landscape and language and the ways in
which land and language interflow. The Rain in the Trees (1988), Travels
(1993), and The Vixen (1996) take the reader inside the implacable intentions
of conquistadors, naturalists, and explorers, across the Pacific to the
ravaged jungles of the Philippines, into the gentle tilt of a Pennsylvania
pasture, to the flicker of health in a New York hospital or the business of a
weasel in the wall of an old French farmhouse. Increasingly he has been
arrested by an intensely sensuous involvement with place. His beautiful prose
work, The Lost Upland (1992), and The Vixen are both book-length eulogies to
the ancient farming country above the Dordogne River that Merwin left thirty
years earlier -- written in Hawaii about France, a tremendous expedition
through time and space to encounter the remnants of our medieval past. And
listen to this recollection in another prose work, Unframed Originals (1982):


The smell of barns drifted even through the market towns that were themselves
not much larger than villages, and in the evenings cows swayed through the
streets guided by peasants with the same long sticks. Pigs grunted behind
arched cellar doors, and were butchered in back alleys, with groups of
experts standing around, and the cobbles running blood. The farm dogs
appeared to be a random mix, but many of them had one pale and one dark eye.
They knew their jobs. They ate soup. The language on the farms was a patois
descended from a Languedoc tongue older than the French of Tours and Paris.


The intentions of Merwin's poetry are as broad as the biosphere yet as
intimate as a whisper. He conveys in the sweet simplicity of grounded
language a sense of the self where it belongs, floating between heaven,
earth, and underground. The tone and directness of his intentions are clearly
declared at the outset of Travels in a poem called "Cover Note":

            ...reader I do
not know that anyone
else is waiting for these
words that I hoped might seem
as though they had occurred
to you and you would take
them with you as your own


It's that ingratiating tone that Merwin's poems take -- confiding, in the
most private way, the most generous of concerns -- that has made him so
welcome and frequent a visitor to The Atlantic Monthly's poetry pages.

Just keeping this going a bit by saying thanks to Matt for his
modification of my last post.  He's right of course to call into question
these constructions of American "individualism," what with their dubious
histories past and present.  I guess my main point which I'll try to state
w/ a bit less hyperbole this time around is that I see American
religiosity as sort of(I hate and hesitate to use this term but here
goes...) always already reactionary - which is to say it is in perpetual
response to the anxiety that the prime mover in American culture is
actually the will to believe in nothing in particular or, worse even, the
will to, in Ralph Ellison's words, "make chaos out of no longer tenable
order."  Utopian to be sure but as Jameson argues so deftly in The
Political Unconscious, utopian gestures are never autonomous, they're
socially symbolic acts.  In a way (and here surely is my own
"American-ness" coming to the fore) I'm more hopeful about American
prospects for secularization b/c the culture doesn't really offer up an
accepatble substitute for God - "The State," for instance.  So maybe
there's a secular, improvisational collective at the end of this road.
That's the utopia I'd like to gesture toward in any case.

-Mike.

David, excuse any heavy-handedness in my response to your post.  I think
we are essentially in agreement about the dangers of any scientific
reductionism (Darwinian fundamentalism, nostalgic empiricism,
utilitarianism, what have you) that prescribes a specific type of poetry,
but I heartily disagree with your assertion that informed speculation
concerning poetry in evolutionary terms cannot tell us anything useful
about contemporary possibilities.

As Henry Gould points out, there is the possibility in this type of
discussion of not simply boxing poetry in a scientific framework but of a
reciprocal reframing of science in the wildness of poetry.  This, I think,
is the best prescription for reading Frederick Turner's work and
understanding his take on the neurobiological roots of poetry.  I think
Turner's theoretical work stands up much better when read in conjunction
with the poetic work that deals most directly with the subject  (I would
recommend the aphorisms in his early book The Garden and the long poem
Field Notes in his upcoming collection, Hadean Eclogues, as the best
points of entry).  This work is, indeed, deeply speculative, "fantasy and
confabulation" if you will, but he does make some fascinating connections
(between verbal play, the performative roots of literature and the
biological roots of ritual, for instance) which I find immensely useful.

And beneath all the jargon Turner offers a simple explanation of "what
poetry is for" which I find profoundly attractive: Joy!

Here's a lot of generalizations to chew on:

America (The US version) is such an odd beast that American writers spend
an inordinate amount of time wondering at it, some of us almost to the
exclusion of all else. And religion, broadly defined, is, I think, at the
heart of it. Us white folks, anyway, have always been messianic, often
millenarian and utopian. This is equally true of the lot that landed in
Boston in 1630, which already saw this savage shore as the last chance to
demonstrate the right ordering of human society, the Adventists, the
Mormons, the socialists, the hippies, and all the believers in various
forms of manifest destiny. We still talk about extending the American Way
to all corners. This has had all kind of results--the elevation of the
individual to such an extent that coherent group action becomes difficult
(one strain of our utopianism actually posits that the collective is
unnecessary--a mere hampering of the individual's possibilities that can be
doffed like an old coat), on the one hand, and the despair in almost all
corners at the failure of the political or theological millenium to arrive.
But let me stick with individualism, the weed sowed here not just by
radical protestantism, but by the fact that America has been the great
escape hatch for individuals and eccentric groups that had a hard time with
the limitations imposed by the collectivities they left. Those most
committed to the old place didn't leave, regardless of circumstance, which
is why there are still Irish in Ireland and Jews and Gypsies in Western
Europe. Those most disaffiliated left most easily, others required the
imposition of more stress, and others decided that the stress of leaving
was more difficult to contemplate than whatever awaited them if they
remained at home. So we have a populace selected and self-selected from
those least skilled at the maintenance of society, and arriving, often,
with an individualist theology in a place where that theology was a
dominant strain. American Exceptionalism is that individualism writ large.
So the hostility toward organized society becomes intense to the point of
manichianism, and you get, as extreme manifestations of widespread
sentiments, anti-flag burning amendments, HUAC, Ruby Ridge, and Oklahoma City.
Now throw in religion. Not all theists are Disney theists, but the Disney
theists, because of their vague religious identification, in an environment
where fine analysis is not exactly a given, are particularly easy for their
more committed brethren to lead astray, into creationism and other
antiscientific mind-sets. We not only have the largest percentage of
self-proclaimed religious believers (and church-goers) in the
industrialized world, we have the largest collection of believers in
astrology, UFO's, etc. What the collective tries to teach to the contrary
is suspect, because the collective may by the very fact of its collectivity
be the enemy. Which leaves a lot of people pretty vulnerable to persuasion
from the collectives that masquerade as the promoters of the individual.
Given the right shepherd the Ramboys become sheep.
        An aside to the correspondent from across the water: students at Penn are
not the same as students in Arkansas and Arizona. Large Northeastern cities
teach relativism as a necessary survival skill, which may be why there is a
more liberal political environment. And of course the kids at Penn are
selected largely from more-affluent, better-educated homes, and come from a
wide variety of environments. When I began teaching in Arizona after years
teaching in New York the contrast was immediate and shocking. The kids at
Columbia, but also at Hunter, were a lot easier to shake out of whatever
preconceptions. This is also true, by the way, of the mostly affluent but
educationally-deprived kids who arrive at UC San Diego. I loved teaching in
Arizona, but I was very aware that I was starting at a different point.
        It's good to remember that, while enormous numbers of Americans live in
the more challenging environments of the Northeast and the San Francisco to
Seattle littoral, they have disproportionately few votes in Washington.
North Dakota has two senators, New York City has none. What those whose
Americanism is most unquestioned do with their beliefs and their votes
matters a lot.

A addendum, perhaps corrective, to the former.

Recently my father-in-law died. He was a life-long Presbytarian, raised by
his minister father in a branch of one of the southern synods whose
orthodoxy would have made John Knox blush. what differentiated them from
their already rather austere bretheren was their disallowance of the vanity
of music and singing in church. His own trajectory had been towards a much
more liberal church and a profound questioning, but at the end he was still
a firm theist. His funeral was at the church at Warren Wilson College, and
he is buried at their cemetery, which blends easily with the pasture across
the fence downhill because there are no headstones, only barely-visible
markers flush to the ground. The cemetery is a few rural miles from his
home. Before, during and after the funeral there was an outpouring of
kindness and support from the community-defined-as-church that was an
extraordinary contrast with the circumstances of my own father's funeral.
My father's death was marked only by a brief gathering conducted by a rabbi
who didn't know him in a commercial funeral parlor, followed by burial in
an industrial-scale cemetery too uncomfortable and too far from anyone's
home to be easily visited.
Some of the church-members who came to the aid of my wife's family I am
told are real sons-of-bitches in their daily lives. But that only makes
their behavior around a major lifechange more impressive. In the crisis the
community was a source of comfort that I can only envy, as the cost of
entry is a belief system that I find at best childish.
I had thought that this kind of event only happened in movies dripping with
treacly nostalgia.
Of course, these little communities have seen themselves as corporate
individuals standing against the larger society since Christ invited the
gang out for passover dinner, and their stated devotion, whatever the
concerns of the individuals within them in their secular lives, is not to
the future of the larger society or the environment but to the salvation of
individual, individually chosen souls, the chosen people elected one by one.

While at Frankfurt Book Fair (which I urge you go to -- the biggest anything
I've ever been to! filled with booklovers! plus headspinning "deals" oy) I
met Zimbabwean poet, Chirikure Chirikure. He read sweet beauty in Shona; his
sister accompanied on mbira. I'll be posting (English trans) poem on
http://poetry.miningco.com Tuesday. Would love to link any Zimbabwean poetry
sites. Help?

ok, i just have to pull out of my own shit for a moment here, and chime in
on the "turner" thread...

weird----there's a mark turner who's written imnsho a profoundly misguided
book, _reading minds:  the study of english in the age of cognitive
science_ (princeton up, of all places, 1991) that presumes to speak
directly to the "poetry of connections" at the neural level, through the
emerging field of "cognitive rhetoric" (we might want to ask what part of
the 'brain' contributed to said field 'emerging,' but that might be asking
for too much)...

if you want to understand what's wrong with notions of chaos theory and the
like applied in more direct ways---let's say "evolutionary" ways---to
poetic production, or to culture in general, you need first, i think,
consider the process of poetic production as, among other things, having
something to do with the ways we think...

which of course surfaces issues of mind-brain... which is precisely where
most such... descriptions?---falter... and interestingly, they seem in
their faltering to be prone to resurrecting a rather dated notion of poetic
"form" (yeah---vs. content)... i've 'argued' elsewhere that this is b/c
mind itself is now thought, in many circles, a technology...

so the politics---politics in the broadest sense, but politics
nonetheless---of such conceptual maneuvers is all too clear... just
starting with cognitive science, for example:  have a good long look at
_the embodied mind:  cognitive science and human experience_, by francisco
varela, even thompson, and eleanor rosch (mit, 1991), just to see where
cognitive scientists began to resist their own disciplinary reductions even
as the "decade of the brain" got started... it's not without its problems,
but then, neither is cogsci...

i hope i don't sound jaded here---although i am, b/c i'm tired of making
this point, which i've been making since i don't know when... i find it
aggravating as hell that both turners, paul lake, whoever others, can
continue to mount arguments predicated on a so-so grasp of the new
sciences... and that they seem in their excursions far less sophisticated
than, say, n. katherine hayles in her work on the "isomorphic" relations
between the new sciences of complexity and other *forms* of cultural
production... and that these chaps do so in order ultimately to propose
either (1) a hierarchy simply of poetic value or (2) an explanation, e.g.,
for how "metaphor" works, i.e., at the *cognitive* level, which generally
leads to a social or disciplinary hierarchy of value... which seems to
suggest a gesellschaft of sorts, for those so inclined... which is right in
line with scientifically absurd, or absurdly scientific, treatments of
value such as roger w. sperry's _science and moral piority:  merging mind,
brain, and human values_(columbia up, 1983)... in fact it's well and good
to try to work out correspondences twixt the sciences, so to speak, and the
arts---but every damn time this happens it seems to be the arts that are to
be "explained" by the sciences... typically with a concluding aesthetic
appeal for the intrinsic beauty or some such of the science so informed,
and the art so 'described'...

anyway... that's my two cents' worth... should be clear i'm with david
kellogg on this one... i say you need to read beneath the signs...

Dear List members,

As some of you know I wrote a Web Page about the late poet Frank Stanford
several months ago (it is currently being updated with new photos,
interviews, sound clips, etc., and will be back up in the next few weeks).
I would like to invite any of you familiar with his work to write a
critical essay for publication on the Web Page.  Length is unimportant, as
I have access to plenty of server space.  Any of you interested can e-mail
me at Brent_Long@brown.edu

I get yr point. But it seems to me that Quilty's point was that these dolts

For people interested in Edwin Honig's poetry, a large portion of his
collected poems, titled TIME & AGAIN - POEMS 1940 - 1995, is now online
at the Contemporary American Poetry Archive.  The site is still under
construction and there are some problems with lineation & spacing,
particularly in the section of Early Poems; also parts 2,4 and 13
are missing, hopefully soon to be added.  There is a table of contents
for the complete collection as well as a bibliography.

Honig has been struggling to find a publisher for this massive collection,
but in the meantime Wendy Battin, Charles Hartman, & their helpers at
CAPA are providing a very heartening service.  CAPA address:

"HOW QUEER ARE WE HERE?"
        INTERROGATING THE EFFICACY OF QUEER THEORY AND POLITICS

************************************************************************CALL FOR
PAPERS

QGPA, the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Graduate and
Professional Association of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities,
Announces an Interdisciplinary Graduate Student Conference:

Recent critical and political theory has attempted to formulate the
notion of "Queer" identity as a radical response to various institutions
of power and domination; critics have posited this queer identity as
both a disruption of traditional subject positions as well as an
opportunity for the creation of alternative, destabilized configurations
of subjectivity.  Increasingly, however, queer identity seems in danger
of "assimilation" by the very institutions that it ostensibly
challenges.  Can queer theory and politics continue to offer effective
resistance to these normalizing regimes of power, and if so what tactics
of deployment will allow them to retain their subversive edge? Our
conference will explore the current situation by posing questions
including, though certainly not limited to, the following:

How--if at all--has the development of a "queer" culture problematized
the earlier "gay" and "lesbian" cultures that came before it?

To what extent do the devotees of queer or other resistant sexual styles
(S&M, Drag, etc.) illustrate the precepts of academic theory by
recognizng their deployment of these styles as actually formative,
rather than merely expressive, of their identities?

How do notions of queer identity intersect with the discourse of
political action?  How does queer theory "resist" or "subvert" hegemony?
And can one speak of a "queer revolution?"

Have the strategies of radical organizations like Queer Nation enabled
the creation of a quepractices merely reinforced the identity categories
already in place?

Has the recent popularization of the "camp" aesthetic negated its
subversive power to re-signify cultural products, thereby reducing
camp's resistance of the market economy to the commodified lure of
"kitsch?"

Does the current trend toward sexual ambiguity in popular advertising
signal the emergence of a new "queer" target audience?  If so, what is
the relation of queer identity to contemporary capitalism?

Has the surge of interest in "drag" performance created "queer" cabaret
spaces in which variously sexed subjects can re-negotiate their own
identity positions?  Or do these performances simply repeat and thus
replicate the common conventions of a male/female gender dichotomy?

What are the implications of genetic research for "queering" our notions
of biological "sex?"  Will the "encoding" of the body effected by the
Human Genome Project reconfigure our definitions of gender, or further
fix the criteria employed in the binary division of sex?

How will the increasing institutionalization of Queer Studies within the
Academy affect its ability to challenge the dictums of power and
authority?

Thanks Joe for that summary of the problems inherent in the Turners' etc
approach to science & hierarchy.

Interesting to see the huge silence that greeted Aviva's posting of:

<<The Atlantic's poetry editor reflects on the career of W. S. Merwin, whose
long association with the magazine spans great distances of geography and art

by Peter Davison>>

& why was that? I found it interesting from a number of perspectives. One,
of course, is the cultural economy, & Davison's neat build-up of his own
editing via praise of Merwin. Another was the bland assumtions carried by a
nifty metaphorical argument for Merwin's growth etc over the years. I also
found intriguing the bio of Davison at the end: two books I probabaly wont
be reading, but does that not simply reveal my biases as against his? Well,
yes, but.

I'm called back to the query as to why I would 'choose' Creeley over
Merwin, which isnt quite what I was doing, although I do admit that given
the choice...

What I suspect I (& many others here) do do is 'choose' a particular open
poetics that Creeley also chooses over one less so that Merwin seem much of
the time to belong to or with. For example that means that I'm a big fan of
Levertov too, but still not of Merwin. But I admit that I dont know
Merwin's work all that well, for the reasons given earlier,that I can only
read so much, have not been called back by his work to his work the way I
am by, well, so many others (in Canada, we have a number of poets many on
the list may not have even heard of, whose work I will continue to read
with great joy: Phyllis Webb, to name just one of Merwin's generation, for
example).

Anyway: what is also fascinating about that Davison article is that it does
represent a particular, & perhaps quite large, 'audience,' as well as a
particular politics, for which his kind of rhetoric of criticism is
meaningful, carries weight. That's the fragmented world of poetry today,
however small, neh?

I warned ya!  I mentioned at the outset that the person who wanted to
discuss Merwin here would not find it a hotbed of Merwin fans....

It would be mildly interesting to know, Douglas, if by "early poetry" you
mean the very academic-formalist-subYeatsian work of the fifties (Green
with Beasts, etc....four books and scads of poems) or the more famous
surreal-derived work after 1960, beginning with The Moving Target.

As I see it he changed rather radically 2 times: in the turn to
surrealist/deep image writing around 1960; and in the turn to a more
relaxed "positive" and affirmative tone about 1971 or so.  Oddly, Marjorie
P. in her scathing article about Merwin treats these periods (and
certainly the two after 1960) as a single body of work with no breaks.

Also oddly, I happened to begin discussing the Perloff essay with a poet
here in Atlanta about a week before Merwin was brought up on the list.  He
recalls it as relatively measured and respectful, with some critique of
Merwin.  I remember it as a savage attack. (--which is not meant to
indicate unfairness; I'm a great fan, in the right context, of savage
attacks on them as deserves 'em...) (Neither the other poet nor myself
considers Merwin someone of the first importance to our universe, but we
were discussing variants in different countries of image-based work
derived from surrealism and related currents..)

I do have some liking for the dark, violent, negative, politically-tinged
surrealist work of the 1960s.  The lightening up after that produces work
that to me reads as flabby and without urgency or content, and written
with a faith that whimsical humanistic sensibility will make undisciplined
and lethargic verse writing interesting...The later work I dislike so is
exemplified by Douglas' favorite, Finding the Islands.  The sixties stuff
I always associated in my mind with the hispanic, French and East
European-based work that influenced it.  And as such, it is not bad, to my
ear.  Perloff of course, doesn't see the break in the early seventies and
(as I recall her analysis) thinks it all pretty poor stuff.  Oddly (why
drop the word when I'm having so much fun?) I agree with most of her
specific analytic points, as to what M's weaknesses are.  But just don't
see them as ruining the work *quite* as much a she does..

It doesn't seem enough to say "poetry is a cultural product." It doesn't
explain how children are lulled to sleep by lullabies or why a spine might
tingle listening to a recording of Yeats.

I just saw a reading that Mackey gave with his wife at Brown University,
and I have to say that it was one of the most boring readings I have ever
been to.  Of course, maybe that is because I have a hard time with
"language" poetry, but he seemed exceptionally vague, with no method to the
madness at all...sorry, but that just ain't poetry in my book.

Brent's detraction aside, I still think most of you would enjoy it; others
I've heard from have told me he's a wonderful reader.  Though I haven't
heard him read yet his work knocks me out.  Those of you who feeling like
taking the gamble probably know who you are.  -m.

Aviva Yogel describes a C.D. Wright lecture as "quirky but brilliant."
 Why the "but"?  Aviva seems to be saying quirky and brilliant. Yet the
but remains. The word is supposed to join contrasting elements, such as
"not bagels, but doughnuts."  Here, it is joining seemingly contrasting
elements that are in fact not so.  A synonymous phrase would be, I
think, "while quirky, neverless brillant."

Funny, I don't dissassociate quirkiness from brilliance at all.  I
think the former is a component of the latter.   I'd be startled at a
brilliant lecture that was not quiky.

What do you'll think?

I'd say "quirkiness" and "brilliance" go pretty much hand and hand for me,
so I'm w/ Jeff.  In fact, quirk is one of those great words which the OED
lists as "of obscure origin," which makes it all the more quirky, as lots
of Q words are, "quibble" for example, which is generally assumed to be a
hybrid of "quip" and "gibe," but who knows.  I spent an afternoon in the Q
section of my dictionary, along with some forays into the a's and i's for
more Q-associated words.  The result was the following piece of writing:

I suppose the "but" occurred because I was initially disappointed or
frustrated with a lecture that was delivered with some of the same
associative leaps and syntactical experiments (on a very mild scale,
relatively speaking) that C.D. tends to use with her poetry.  Having at first
hoped for a more prosaically-expressed lecture, as I'm used to, I felt myself
having trouble engaging fully...until about midway through, I'd become
accustomed to her delivery, and could hear with more flexible ears.
 Suddenly, I was engaged on several levels; the usual "listening to a good
lecture" level which is quite analytical, and the unusual "listening to a
poem" level which is more intuitive.  The first kind of listening is
generally a more linear experience, while the second kind is generally a more
global experience.  Part of C.D.'s brilliance, I have concluded, comes from
her ability to offer a lecture that stimulated and occupied both kinds of
listening processes.

Just for the record, Nate Mackey read solo (no wife) at Brown on 16th
October 1997, doing a set entirely drawn from the *Song of the
Andoumboulou* cycle (no particular affiliation with "language" poetry).  Of
the fifty or more people there, few that I spoke with shared Brent's
opinion.  The *Song* chronicles the wanderings of a spectral collective, a
sort of rough sketch for a possible humanity, through mishaps sexual,
musical, and unusual.  It'd be poetry in most books.

Come to think of it, Brent probably means to point the polemical finger at
P. Inman, who on 8 October read his work, often rhythmed out of sub-lexical
morphemes, with Tina Darragh.  While I would heartily dispute Brent's
dismissive take on the event, the response seems more likely directed there
than at Mackey.

I know that "language" poetry or "language poetry" or language poe"try" covers
just about everything from Hans Jonas to Rin Tin-Tin these days, but you'll
have to explain to me how it covers these gnostic riffs from Nate Mackey's
"Songs of the Andoumboulou: 12":

     Weathered raft I saw myself
 adrift on.

     Battered wood I dreamt I
 drummed on, driven.

Scissored rose, newly braided
  light, slack hoped-for rope
     groped at, unraveled.

                      Braided star
   we no longer saw but remembered,
     threads overlapping the rim
  of a sunken world, rocks we
    no longer saw by extinguished,
  Namoratunga's long-tethered
                              light.

That's the opening anyway--apologies for lineation inexactitude resulting from
the program.

The point is that you'll read all day and all night in the "lan"guage poets
I know, from Andrews to Tin-Tin, without finding anything much looking like
this.

last I saw Mackey and his wife, she was working on a promising book about
Genet -- As far as I know, they've never "read" together, though I've seen
them reading at the same time --

On the other hand, it would be pretty hard to mistake Pete Inman and Tina
Darragh for Nataniel & Pascal Mackey --

so . . . what DID happen at the reading????????

When Danielle Collobert was mentioned a few days ago I asked Norma Cole to
email me the details of her translation of Collobert. The book is called It
Then and was published by O Books in 1989.

http://www.OBooks.com/

Another source of contemporary French writing, including more Collobert, (I
can't remember whether this was already posted) is Violence of the White
Page/Contemporary French Writing edited by Stacey Doris, Emmanuel Hocquard
and Phillip Foss and published by Foss as an issue of Tyuonyi.

Norma also provided the following info about the upcoming translation issue
of Raddle Moon about which Susan Clark has also posted:


Raddle Moon 16:  TWENTY-TWO NEW (to North America) FRENCH WRITERS!!!!
Probably all born after 1950, some even after 1960.  Or younger!!!!
Edited by Norma Cole & Stacy Doris, with translations by 22 American writers,
this new issue should be out sometime in the next week or two.  Check out RM
website.

Couldn't agree more.  I've just finished reading Keith Waldrop's _The
Silhouette of the Bridge_ a wonderfully rich exploration/celebration of
memory, its products and processes.  Some quotes:

_A singer's death is more affecting than that of a writer, since a poem or a
story stands at more of a distance from the body that has produced it._

The theme of the body is returned to later in a section featuring Keith's
dentist.
e.g.

_"Poetry," he once murmured, his hand in my mouth, "can you live off of
poetry? I mean now," he goes on, since I can't answer, "everybody has teeth."_

The dental meditations are interspersed with pieces dealing with desert
hermits and Sister Josefa, a victim-saint who willingly went to hell taking
on the sins of others.  Satan didn't get much change out of her however
because of her invincible innocence.

_Think how Satan must have scrutinized every fiber, every synapse, for an
entrance - eternal he may be, but his space is limited - and he could not
find one._

One could go on an on.  Wonderful characters sketched, ideas great and small
held up and looked at, the unique minutiae, vast systems, a real sense of a
rich and nimble mind.  A mind too that is not so particularly impressed with
itself thus a style that is endlessly engaging and oh just read.  Do.

i used to think quirky and brilliant went together, but then i got an
academic job where i have met many people who are very smart but have never
had an original thought in their lives.  it threw me for a loop initially,
but now i see it more and more. i used to just not consider these people
brilliant or even smart, but maybe my standards have relaxed, faute de

just a mackey side-note: i taught his work to my "experimental poetry"
class for the first time last week. their response: "why is this
experimental? this seems just like --poetry."  it was a compliment, or
their way of saying that content seemed really important.

Unfortunately, the web site that Laura posted

http://www.wimsey.com/~ksw/pnet/publicat/raddle/rm.htm

which appears on the masthead of our recent issue is no longer
functional as its provider [wimsey.com] is defunct. We are re-building
it and getting a new ISP. It should be ready in a couple of weeks and
will have ordering information and full tables of contents for past and
forthcoming issues and -- probably later -- a small portfolio of work
from recent and forthcoming issues. I'll post to the list as soon as
it's up.

Everything else Laura says is true!

Mark P., --

as one much drawn to Mewin & having considerable respect
for Marjorie Perloff's tremendous critical chops (and sharing
interest in much that she celebrates), your mention of an essay
(scathing or otherwise) by her re: him, makes me curious.  Do you
happen to know where that's located?

The turns you mention in Merwin's work seem right, but would I'd add
that he has taken further turns *After* the 70s material.  The work
in *Travels* exemplifies one such, and what's found in *The Vixen*
seems a further development, in a rather different stride from
anything before -- in which the "concerns" of the 60s work is layered
within a new mode of formalism quite different from his original
(50s) formalism, but maybe echoing it (very distantly, or somehow) --
with a few exceptions, where formalism (in old sense) is explicit, as
in the remarkable poem "Search Party" (based on Villon) . . .

a few old poems, such as "The Way to the River" and one called (if
memory serves) "A Hymn to the Eyes" (both prob. from the *Carrier of
Ladders* / *Drunk in the Furnace* period more or less) -- or one
entitled "Route with No Number", are among those that occasioned
repeated readings (in recent few years).  My involvement with the
evocations of *Finding the Islands* was partly related to painting,
as some of the Jungianisms therein (and the way in which a melding of
*ghazal* with *haiku* seemed to occur) found place in my colored
notebooks; -- anyone interested to have some sense of where WSM is at
these latter days could do worse than to peruse the title poem of
*The Vixen* -- a summary poem, seems . . .

well, I know I'm in a minority here, n'est pa?  I started reading
Merwin when I started reading Scalapino & Palmer (& thence Creeley &
Ashbery & whatnot, circa some mere decade & half ago -- and carry all
these motley strands along still . . . , w/ delight) -- maugre the
hubub of schools, I loves 'em

You might also mention Ted Berrigan and his widow. Both excellent poets.
Not to mention Creeley and his ex-wife. I thought that Browning was a
better poet than his wife, but Shelley wasnt as good a novelist as HIS wife.

i'm current at work on the levy pages fr the Burning Press website;
a number of sites online have sum work (best is at karl young's
Light & Dust site...)  will tag on what i have in process to this
message.

Ingrid Swanberg's _zen concrete & etc._ is th easily available
source, the texts are flawed by editing.  the ghost press anthology
_ukanhavyrfuckincitybak_ is great (usually cataloged by puritan
librarians as "d.a. levy, a tribute to the man, an anthology of
his poetry" or somesuch), most ov the text ok'd by levy...  th
druid books _collected poems_ has no criticism & plenty of errors
but contains some work thats hard to get elsewhere.  jw curry has
a onepage visual essay, in his book frm runaway spoon, that totally
changed my percept of levy's work--check w/ grumman fr th title...

best publicly available archive is at kent state, i think...  why
dont you stop by some time & we'll make a run down there together?
i gotta do some checking m'self...

more later

David,

That was a really interesting and useful post.  I'm quite tickled by your
bracketting Palmer, Scalapino, Creeley and Ashbery together with Merwin.
It certainly does help to shake up the seige-mentality sense of "schools"
we all fall into.  Your mention of time-frame is very important, I think.
*When* one encounters a poet, and in what time-relation to
encountering various *other* poets, always ends up having a lot to do with
how they think about them.  I in contrast encountered Merwin first around
1969 or 1970.  At that time (and for some years thereafter) I thought of
Duncan and Olson as the basis for what should be done in U.S. poetry, but
saw no one who seemed to agree with me (I was about 15, mind you, and
there was lots I didn't know about going on..But for that moment in time I
wasn't that far off!!) So I turned to exploring work from other national
and linguistic cultures, as sustenance, and that meant surrealist-derived,
image-based work, very often.  So that's the frame in which Merwin always
recurs in my memory.  But as I say, don't much like his stuff after 1970,
which seems to me to lack urgency, and to be by virtually a different
poet, despite the superficial similarity of technique.

Anyway discussions like this are useful because we all give lip service to
an open field of different poetries, but we still tend to have a
ghettoized approach, intuitively, to thinking about conemporary work.  So
I think we owe (Brent, I think it was) who started the thread, some
thanks.  (Also I agree with him that we ought to have more discussions of
recent work; ones that like this one go a bit beyond expressions of
preference.)

As for Perloff's essay.  I don't own the book, and I recently returned all
of her books to the library (had far too many things checked out!) but the
poet with whom I'm discussing it says that the essay occurs in Poetic
License : essays on modernist and postmodernist lyric.

Regards,
Mark

More info for Tom Phillips aficionados: The videos he made with Peter Greenaway
of the first VIII cantos of"Inferno" for British Channel Four (before the money
dried up) are now available in the States.  I saw them the other night, & they'
re highly recommended.  Phillips himself is featured, delivering wry commen-
tary. The visuals are striking of course: evidently his input in the collabora-
tion had a lot to do with the shifts in Greenaway's style that you can see in
"Prospero's Books" & "The Pillow Book."

Okay foks....Here is your friendly librarian poet, with a few defensive
quibbles, by way of reply to lbd, aka Robert Drake.

These days things ain't as interesting and loose and goosey here in the
library world as once upon a time.  You can find the cataloging used by
most libraries in shared databases like OCLC (and the one most widely used
IS, in fact, OCLC).  Librarians don't do as much original cataloging as in
the past.  So you can find what is "usually" done by librarians in
cataloging a given title, by checking OCLC. There are two records there
for the book. Both very happily include the world fuck, and the compound
word it's embedded in, in several fields of the record.  Searchable
fields.  What lbd was thrown by is a simple cataloging rule, one that's
fairly reasonable, but which derives from mainstream trade publishing, and
not the more varied kind of formats often used in complexly-designed
small-press poetry books and chapbooks.  The rule is, that the main title
(245 field in the MARC format) is what appears on the title page.
According to all the records,D.A. Levy : a tribute to the man, etc.
appears on the title page. The long compound word with fuck in it appears
on the cover, and *all* cataloging practice for a very long time has
considered that the *cover title*...But it is given in the records, quite
clearly.  Honestly, what lbd noticed has *nothing* to do with the
four-letter word...Go look in OCLC and you'll find dozens of books with
that word in the title.  Nothin' to do with puritans.  (Anyway, as a huge
fan of Christopher Hill and the radicals who made the English Revolution
and chopped off the king's head, I resent the comment on behalf of BOTH
librarians AND puritans!!)

Carl:

I don't know if it's been mentioned yet, but Hugh Fox has some early
preliminary stuff on Levy that, if memory serves, isn't bad, in a book
called something like _The Living Underground_. From the early 70s, I
think.
        Also, I attended an academic conference this past weekend at which
a graduate student presented a paper on levy. There was more Lyotard and
co. than d.a. levy in it, but if you're interested, contact me backchannel
and I'll give you her name and address so you can write for the paper.

"The suggestion that the artist's perception of the world is more complex and
intricate than that of the audience (NOT TO MENTION THAT OF HIS CREATIVE
FOREBEARS) [note: "bears" - ed.] is ultimately undemocratic and unconvincing..
. The proposition that the artist feels, comprehends and expresses something
unattainable by the ordinary person is no more convincing than the suggestion
that the artist's physical pain, hunger, and sexual satisfaction are more
intense than those of a commoner. [He's been reading his elizabethans - ed.]
True art is always democratic precisely because there is no denominator more

This little paragraph, beautifully round and perfect, should convince every
listreader of the particular glory of Russian vodka-conversation culture
and its superiority to every other discourse. For me this
paragraph is only equalled by the sentence in Brodsky's essay "Flight from
Byzantium" in which he says [to paraphrase] "Constantine was, in a sense,
the first Crusader."  [ed. note: historians generally agree it was the
Crusades that finally destroyed the Byzantine empire].  - Henry Gould

God knows it's not like me to problematize, nor (on a good day) would I
even dream of destabilizing anyone's configuration of subjectivity.  But
this list of the "hundred most distinguished" is intriguing.  Are
nominations debated by tenured revolutionary committee?

Subject:      Re: Heath 3, help?!

I've just received a copy of the new (1998) 3rd edition, Volume 2, of
the Heath Anthology of American Literature, Paul Lauter, General
Editor.  I served as a consultant, reviewed the 2nd edition, and
suggested a number revisions in the modern and contemporary poetry
selections.  As might be expected, most of my suggestions were not
accepted.  Many of my arguments appear in _Opposing Poetries_ where I
take the Heath to task for a narrow aesthetic range.  For this 3rd
edition, I suggested many changes, including a CD-ROM or an audiotape
selection, an expanded range of selections by Baraka and Lorde,
inclusion of a range of oral poetries including Rothenberg's work
(particularly the Navajo Horse Songs) and Jack Foley's work, AND some
attention to a range of Language writings.

What's weird is that in the Preface to the 3rd edition, I find myself
thanked for my suggestions as a reviewer.  And then:

"Though we considered these commentaries [those of a number of
reviewers] very carefully, we were not always able to follow the
advice of our reviewers.  For example, Hank Lazer argued eloquently
for a selection of the "Language Poets," but we were not persuaded
that they would be taught by most users of the anthology.  We could
be wrong, and we would certainly like to hear from others on that
subject, among others."  (xlvii)

Well, there are some noteworthy and pleasing additions to the 3rd
edition of the Heath.  For example, there is now a new section,
"Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, and Objectivist Poetry."  Though
the blurb in the latest Heath Newsletter makes this claim:  "The
offerings of language poets has been enriched by a new section,
'Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, and Objectivist Poetry."  There
is also a new selection from Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's _DICTEE_ and
selections from Gloria Anzaldua's Borderlands/La Frontera.

I would encourage Poetics persons who wish to dispute the decision to
exclude the "Language Poets" to write to any or all of the following:

Paul Lauter

Trinity College
300 Summmit St.
Hartford, CT 06106-3100

Houghton Mifflin Company
College Division

Heath also operates a discussion group on American Literature at

t-amlit@list.cren.net
To subscribe to T-AMLIT, send a message to listproc@list.cren.lit
with the message   subscribe T-AMLIT your name

I hate to see the range of my recommendations reduced to "Language
Poetry," but that does make for an interesting flashpoint in the
institutionalization of contemporary poetry.  I realize that for many
of you, the entire issue of anthologies is of little interest.  I
also would point out that I have often taught from the Heath
anthology, and I consider Paul Lauter a friend, though a friend with
whom I have some substantial disagreements.  I think that the Heath
has been an important American Literature anthology, particularly the
first edition.  But the situation for poetry, particularly 20th
century poetry in the Heath, pisses me off.  Or at least that's a
response after a quick glance at the "new" Heath....  Thought various
ones of you might be interested.

Fine egalitarian sentiments those are from Joseph Brodsky. Fine versifier
though he was, but I wonder if he meant this with every person he met, every
baby he kissed. As much as I hate elitism, I tend to be skeptical of populism,
which leads to (or is) just another manifestation of social realism. The
problem here is his "true art is always democratic." Problematic in a
democracy(?) where ideas and criticism are shunned at large, and where there
has been a systematic dumbing-down of it's citizenry for decades now. For him
to say undemocratic is paramount to saying unpopular. The suggestion that the
artist's perception of the world is more complex and intricate than that of the
audience may well be true and convincing, but only because it happens to be
more developed at that time. More accurately, the artist is more narrowly
focused or tuned in to a particular idea than is most of the audience
(depending on the audience). Like it or not, look at how unavoidable and
essential specialization is today. I do agree though with Brodsky when he
speaks against what is thought to be unattainable or incomprehensible by the
"ordinary person." The question is where each of us is NOW; a sober, self-assay
is required by the individual here.

Henry, as much as I would like to partake right now in Russian
vodka-conversation, I'm not convinced of its superiority to EVERY other
discourse except theory. Allow me to add that there is no denominator more
common, whether in society or history, than the sense of death, and that a
better alternative should be sought. Death is a subset of reality sure, but a
small space in time exists for a reality/non-reality called poetry and science
:- ).

I don't think you can fault Brodsky's statement because at the present
time the U.S. is not fulfilling its own democratic principles.  Democracy
is not simply a U.S. product or token in an ideological-historical
(i.e. east/west or cold war) game.  Also I'm confused where you say
Brodsky suggests that the artist's vision is inherently more complex,
etc.  I thought Brodsky was saying the opposite.  I think Brodsky is
linking art & democracy because they are both active assertions of
shared freedom, one predominantly political, the other aesthetic.
The fact that forces in the US & the west use the term "freedom"
to support forms of economic slavery & inequality, again, doesn't
belie his statement.  You raise the question, though - what happens
to the "democratic" character of art in an age of very spongy
political democracy?  (or is that an accurate characterization
of the political climate?)  Does the following equation apply:
art/entertainment = citizenship/idiocy?  Only in a dangerously
simplified mathematical State, probably.  But doesn't art offer,
if not clarification, the democratic invitation to participate
in complexity?  Moral & aesthetic?  Along with the freedom to
turn down the invitation or even turn it upside down.  That's the
power in the artist's hand.

I was just kiddin' about the vodka-superiority argument. (or half-
kidding).

<< By the way,  I'd be very interested to see one of those ghazal/haiku

Here are a scant couple verses, fetched from memory --

______________________

The earth is bleeding into the sea far out
we look away
one side of the heart is dark
______________________

As the ant knows
where the honey is
I know the way to you
______________________

In referring to a (sort of) melding of haiku and ghazal in Merwin's work, I
was speaking specifically of the form he developed for himself in or around
the 70s -- issued in *Finding the Islands* (North Point Press).

Someone w/ *Finding the Islands" on hand might care to share a complete poem
(I mean, one of the shorter ones) -- so that the sense of the individual
verses within the whole might be more apparent.

Biblio-note:  Not sure if that volume is still being kept in print (by
Random House, which picked up some of the North Point books after the latter
press folded), -- but there are *some* of those poems included (under title
"Feathers From the Hill") in the newly issued *Flower & Hand* (Copper Canyon
Press).  This book follows up Copper Canyon's re-publishing effort for
Merwin's work (as the out-of-print books selected from in *F&H* are a few
vols that appeared subsequent to those included in Merwin's *The Second Four
Books*, also from Copper Canyon).

To chut to the case, till I get my bookshelves assembled, it's uncertain if
I'll be able to find either *Finding the Islands* or get my hands on *Flower
& Hand* -- meanwhile, those 2 stanzas seem to be the only ones I'm able to
dredge from memory.

All stanzas are in three lines.  The poems consist of a string of such, of
indeterminate (or not-predetermined) number, -- the length for a particular
poem varying considerably.

As you might know, one characteristic of the *ghazal* form (in Persian and
Urdu) is the fragmentary nature of the peom -- that is, not only is there no
requirement that there be an explicit line of continuity from couplet to
couplet (all ghazals being written as strings of couplets), but there is (to
generalize) an anticipation that each couplet will stand on its own, in
terms of subject & image etc. -- that is, the norm is somewhat *away* from
overt continuity.  Still, there's a strong link in the prosody (and
thematics) -- including the rrequisite repetition of a key phrase at the end
of the 2nd line (and with a feminine rhyme including said phrase).  That
sort of thing is *not* done in Merwin's verses (nor by many translators of
ghazals); Merwin's FTI poems do, though, typically have a manner of loosened
continuity (stanaza to stanza) that reminds me of the freedom (in that
regard) typical of the ghazal, and also reminds of a somewhat similar
ranginess in Japanese "linked" verse forms.

My notion of an influence of the ghazal on the *FTI* poems is partly based
on a comment Merwin makes (as quoted in the intro to Aijaz Ahmad's volume
(published I think around the early 70s? by Columbia U. Press, and long out
of print, sorry to say) *Ghazals of Ghalib*) to the effect that he was
particularly happy to discover the approach of the *ghazal* (as I've tried
to describe above) -- the way in which each verse has a kind of autonomy and
yet some sense of connection with the whole -- the pearls-in-a-strand manner
of that poetic tradition & form.

Merwin remarked that this seemed in line with (or helpful egarding)
experiments he was working with at that point -- said work being, it seems
clear, the *FTI* poems.

More than his comment, the work itself strikes me as interestingly
reminiscent of east asian poetries as well as ghazal poetry.  (I'm not aware
that anyone has heretofore broached such comparison per se.)

I don't fault Brodsky for saying these things (they are wonderful IDEAS),
rather I simply remain somewhat skeptical regarding their implications in the
present. I may have sounded a bit reactionary (which shouldn't surprise), but I
see myself somewhere in the middle here. That democracy is not a U.S. product
is certain. However, one could understandably take the democratic system in
which these statements were made as his audience, and given his poet laureate
position (though I don't know if this was written when he held that chair),
that would make it all the more plausible. And given human behavior such as it
is in this imperfect reality, I believe that I would still take exception to
the implications in his statements knowing what could be publicly made of them
in anyone's democracy. This even though I understand and respect him when he
speaks of the hope that "a better alternative should be sought" for our
imperfect reality.

I thought so too, but didn't perhaps make it clear. I did not mean to say that
Brodsky suggested that, but that I suggest that. I was suggesting that it may
actually be true for a given audience and the myriad of specific cases that can
arise in the present moment whenever that is.

Although the question of democratic character of art in an age of very spongy
political democracy is interesting and applicable here, it is not really where
I wanted to be in this. This is an old battleground really: art and the public,
and it is unpopular to say it, but the masses may be spongy. Sartre speaks a
good deal about this in _Literature and Existentialism_. The disappearing
Bourgeois and all that. Jose Ortega y Gasset does a great job on it in _Man and
Crisis_.

I agree completely with you that art offers the democratic invitation to
participate in complexity, in obscurity, and whatever else the artist cooks up.
This kind of interaction could be be ideal if the artist is also free, and
fatal if he is not. Surely then it must follow that art offers the freedom (to
the public I assume) to turn down the invitation or turn it upside down. I
believe this is where the problem is (for me anyway) since the public has
largely rejected complexity in this century with its accusations of obscurity,
hermeticism, etc. The obscurity isn't there necessarily for its own sake. I
don't buy the excuses that a reasonably well educated public gives for
rejecting or condemning the art and literature of whichever part of this
century simply because they have opted out in favor of other pastimes and forms
of entertainment without giving it some time. The populist solution is to make
the work palatable and easy for whomever and then it will be acceptable. That
is the part of the equation that I cannot abide by.

You raise some issues that have been around awhile(!) & can't be wished
away.  But I think you're melding together "democracy - masses - public
opinion", and assuming too much in the process.  Again, I think Brodsky
was connecting the process of democracy - whereby some individuals
get together & decide they will govern themselves, rather than be
governed - and the process of art, whereby some individuals get together
& share creative works.  It happens on a field of free equality; that's
it.  He's not saying "good art can be evaluated democratically" (by
a process of compromise & consensus?), or "good art must be popular".
He's saying art expresses human experience, rather than enlightening
it or reforming it or refining it "from above".  In this he is going back
to Mandelstam, and Akhmatova, as he does constantly in essay after essay.
He is one of the Petersburg poets, a close stream.  & one of the standards
of their Acmeism (as against Symbolism) is that the artist is like
everybody else.  - Henry Gould

re:

I think this discussion has emigrated to a strange, attenuated country.

I thought poetry had something to do with language.

The above statement seems to suggest that it is concerned with an
intensified everybodyness. Even if we stretched that out to cover
everybody's use of language, we'd be stretching.

We could just as easily say "The engineer is just like everybody else, only
more so" or "The tobacco company executive is just like everybody else,
only more so". See, it pretty well fits everybody, and in each case it
takes on its own slant.

Am I missing something?

Is it the obscurity that people object to or that the material is based
upon cultural assumptions they do not ascribe to? The audience's feeling of
obscurity would be the same, but the causes and solutions would vary, would
they not?

As a clarification: artists might create so-called obscure texts out of a
deep reading of democracy, but the audience might not be interested in deep
readings of democracy, and might be reading something quite different than
democracy when democracy is mentioned. Furthermore, the aesthetic that led
to the so-called obscure text might be justifiable, but will not be read
properly by people living in the strange land of secondary readings, where
democracy does not mean democracy, and so forth. Pop culture is a code,
too, as is art.

As a digression: would it be possible to sidestep this problem by using a
sophisticated aesthetic to manipulate the icons of pop culture, but not for
the purposes of pop culture?

Harold:

If you missed something, it was the quote to which I was responding --

"I thought poetry had something to do with language."

--so did everybody else

"I think that I shall never see a poem more lovely than a tree."

Couldn't we substitute "house" for "poem"?

Couldn't we substitute "sea" for "tree"

My guess would be that people object to what they see as obscurity for its own
sake on the first order, or if they belong a different cultural group than the
artist that might be the first order objection. Some may receive so-called
obscure work for similar reasons.

This adds to the discussion I think, but what is meant by being read properly
in the context of poetry vs say prose?

Hi, Aviva.

For the past few months, I've worked on a series of poems based on
four-fold word squares run through an anagram generator which produces
c. 500K of lines employing the 16 letters in words. I sift through them,
identify the most likely, & let them mull about until they find an order
I also recognize. For example [I hope this comes through the email
intact!]:

WORD
ALOE
RISE
POEM


I wore a prose model
or a sole weird poem,
a woe period morsel.
I seldom wore a rope.
I led a morose power,
a wide remorse loop,
or I rose, a lewd poem,
a poem idle or worse.
we lose a prior dome,
a slow ode or empire;
we despoil a Rome, or
deplore a wise room.
more power is a dole.
desire me, a poor owl.

While the Heath anthologists may not have been persuaded that the
"Language Poets" _would_ be taught by most "users" of the anthology, they
just _gauranteed_ that they would not be taught by excluding them.

yes & no --

how's this for one poss. interpretive reading of the sentence:

  [What] the poet [expresses] is just like [what] everybody else
  [expresses], only more so

the relationship between what is, and what is said, is arguably
relevant to just about any poetics worth its seasalt --

poets being in the biz of exploring that, they may sometimes give it
voice more acutely --

to the extent that what-one-is is (so far as writing goes) evidenced
by the written, ergo, the poet may well evidence it more so, eh?

whether the poet really IS more so, or whether the being more so is
simply more evident, is a worthy enough question, maybe --

but sometimes, in some circumstances, it might be that the focus on &
attention to these problematics may acutize [new word?] the being, or
at least seem to so do, hmm?

. . . a few thoughts on that

One of the great literary men/women of our time died today:  James
Laughlin.  Many on this list whose work he published and who cherished his
own poetry, memoirs, and essays, this is a sad, sad, day.

I'm in Indiana doing a residency (Patten Lectures) and can't write at
normal speed, but I'm sure there will be more material coming in from
Eliot Weinberger or Jerome Rothenberg etc. etc.  I just wanted people to
know.

A true Acmeist position.  I should have qualified previous post by
noting that the Acmeist polemic with the Symbolists, in which Gumilov,
Mandelstam & others took the approach that the artist was not an
exalted priestly personage but an ordinary earthbound creature,
was tempered on both sides of the debate by the Petersburgian
hauteur, the respect for cultural tradition, the aristocracy of
the intelligentsia... a very different animal from what we understand
to be "populism".  - Henry G.

I was implying that the individuals so inclined would establish a
representative government of not particularly un-venal well-meaning
buddy-system cousins such as we have here in Grand Fenwick, otherwise

Yes - this is part of what the Acmeist "program" involved.  But it's
sloppy of me to keep calling Brodsky an "acmeist", a tenuous "movement"
back at the turn of the other century.  He may have found a closer
model for the style he was after in Auden: the anti-heroic, the
everyday human-humane.  - Henry G.

Henry Gould suggests of Brodky: " It happens on a field of free equality; that's
it.  He's not saying "good art can be evaluated democratically" (by
a process of compromise & consensus?), or "good art must be popular".
He's saying art expresses human experience, rather than enlightening
it or reforming it or refining it "from above".  In this he is going back
to Mandelstam, and Akhmatova, as he does constantly in essay after essay.
He is one of the Petersburg poets, a close stream.  & one of the standards
of their Acmeism (as against Symbolism) is that the artist is like
everybody else."

It's the end of this that I agree with. The necessary recognition, contra
Romanticism, that the artist is not superior *as a human being* but only in
so far as s/he is able to create within an art. The artist is not a better
person, just capable of _art_iculating the humanity, etc. s/he shares with
everyone.

Makes sense to me.

Sometimes, of course, the complexity of that articulation (in music,
painting, poetry, whatever) takes the art beyond what a great many people
want to bother learning to comprehend. I guess them's the breaks...

Yes. It is more desirable to consider Brodsky the exile here in the Etat Unis
and his declarations in the context of this end-of-century rather than the
last.

I don't know what is meant by the "melding together of democracy - masses -
public opinion," other than perhaps an attempt on my part to discuss openly
some thoughts that I had after the reading of the Brodsky quote (and in a
broader, yet proper context - no assumptions necessary). It is easy to speak of
ideas which are heretofore fleshless.

Some quotes from Jean-Paul Sartre do a much better job than I at saying what
needs to be said:

"There is classicism when a society has taken on a relatively stable form and
when it has been permeated with the myth of its perenniality, that is, when it
confounds the present with the eternal and historicity with traditionalism,
when the hierarchy of classes is such that the virtual public never exceeds the
real public and when each reader is for the writer a qualified critic and a
censor, when the power of the religious and political ideology is so strong and
the interdictions so rigorous that in no case is there any question of
discovering new countries of the mind, but only of putting into shape the
commonplaces adopted by the elite in such a way that reading -- which, as we
have seen, is the concrete relation between the writer and his public -- is a
ceremony of recognition analogous to the bow of salutation, that is, the
ceremonious affirmation that author and reader are of the same world and have
the same opinions about everything."

"The political triumph of the bourgeoisie which writers had so eagerly desired
convulsed their condition from top to bottom and put the very essence of
literature into question...There is no doubt that by identifying the cause of
belles-lettres with that of political democracy they helped the bourgeoisie
come to power, but by the same token they ran the risk of seeing the
disappearance of the object of their demands, that is, the constant and almost
the only subject of their writing."

"Bourgeois art would either be a means or would not be...Its public feared
nothing so much as talent, that gay and menacing madness which uncovers the
disturbing roots of things by unforseeable words and which, by repeated appeals
to freedom, stirs the still more disturbing roots of men. Facility sold better;
it was talent in leash, turned against itself, the art of reassuring readers by
harmonious and expected discourse, in a tone of good fellowship, that man and
the world were quite ordinary, transparent, without surprises, without threats,
and without interest."

James Laughlin has been a champion of literature in this century against the
publishing juggernauts, and will most certainly be missed. His extremely
sensitive portrayal of the late years of William Carlos Williams is indicative
of his humanity, his generosity of which enough cannot be said.

Sadly,

        Joseph,
        Not only publishing New Directions, James Laughlin is an important
American lyric poet.  His "Collected Poems" is about the last word in
economy, as far as romance goes.

I should have written more clearly when I accused WB of assumptions.
The assumptions I was referring to involved the idea that when Brodsky
connected "good art" and "democracy" he was historicizing or
commenting on the relations between elite, aristocrat, or bourgois
interests & the mass public.  And I tried to relate the function of
art & the function of democracy (self-governance) on an abstract level,
which I think is what Brodsky was doing.  I have no problem with
WB or anyone else commenting on the realities of art, politics
& the public with the advent of "bourgois democracy".  The fact that
the bourgois doesn't appreciate fine art or the fact that the
aristocrat concieves literature as part of a fixed ritual of social
hierarchy, however, undermines neither art nor democracy, despite
whatever complaints both Baudelaire & Sartre may raise. - Henry Gould

I honestly can't say if I would be in poetry right now if not for James
Laughlin and New Directions Books. I like the story Octavio Paz has in _The
Other Voice_ about him, and would like to share it.

"The case of American Publishing house New Directions is a notable example.
James Laughlin, the son of a well-to-do family, studied at HArvard some fifty
years ago. A poetry lover despite his disappointment at the professors he had,
he decided to spend some time in Rapallo, where Ezra Pound was the focal point
of a small group devoted to the study of poetry--the "Ezraversity," as Pound
himself called his circle. After six months of sharing their experiences, Pound
and Laughlin made a pact: Laughlin would become a publisher and devote himself
to bringing out books by Pound, William Carlos Williams, and other poets of
that time. Thus New Directions came into being. It is a house that has lasted
more than half a century and accomplished two equally difficult things:
refusing to become a gigantic multinational corporation, while publishing not
only many valuable North American poets but also the corpus of modern European
and Latin Literature.

In his recent volume of delightful and intelligent prose (Recollections of a
publisher, 1989), Laughlin notes that Pound recommended what books he should
publish but gave no advice about how to sell them. He adds: "perhaps he didn't
know or didn't care. I can't remember his exact phrase but he seemed quite
content if something he had written and given to some obscure magazine reached
the eyes and beans of twenty-seven readers, if they were the righr readers, the
ones who would diffuse his ideas." Laughlin had the good sense not to follow
all of Pound's advice: he did not publish, for instance, the eccentric economic
theories of Major Clifford Hugh Douglas. But he quickly understood that the new
literature, unanimously scorned by university professors and well-entrenched
critics, could win a small but fervent public. It was an undertaking that went
against current tastes and deliberately appealed to a minority. In a letter,
Pound wrote to his young friend: "For Christs sake meditate on something I once
told you: Nothing written for pay is worth anything; only what has been written
against the market. There is nothing so inebriating as earning money. Big check
and you think you have done something and two years later there is nothing
 bloody well to show for it." These lines were written in 1940. Nine years
later, Pound renewed the charge: "The death of all the old staid American
publishing houses would be a sign of God's favor to humanity. There are no
known acts on the part of these firms that ever favored living writers or
literature."

James Laughlin was heir to an immense Pennsylvania steel fortune. He was
also a poet and lover of literature. It's fair to say he did as much for
American poetry in this century as anyone - publishing, and keeping in
print, Pound, Williams, HD, Henry Miller, Kenneth Patchen - the list goes on
forever.

The story goes, as Laughlin himself relates in his marvelous _Pound As Wuz_,
that he went to sit at the feet of the master in Rapallo in the late 30's.
Pound, however, advised him to give up poetry and start a publishing company
that would print Pound and Pound's pals. The rest is history, as they say.
And fortunately, Laughlin disregarded Pound's advice about poetry. He kept
at it, producing several books of spare, lyrically direct poems that were
delicate without being precious. His death is indeed a great loss. American
poetry owes him a debt which can only be repaid by keeping faith with his
committment to making it new.

"Catullus is my master" begins the poem "Technical Notes" placed in
the opening section of Laughlin's Collected Poems.  For me, Laughlin
is a rare master of that daily ceremony in which our vulgarity is
wedded to the austerity of hope.  Laughlin would probably want to be
remembered as a love poet, which is an honorable simplification, but
a simplification nonetheless.  He also wrote much about other
aspirations, and the facts which check them.  And in all manner of
lines: short, long, American, French, careful, carefree.  And his
line-breaks across words is a lasting example of deft construction,
in his hands a blatant affirmation of craft that is neither precious
nor crass.  As in these poems about death:

"Write on My Tomb"

that all I learned in books
and from the muses I've ta-

ken with me but my rich pos-
sessions I have left behind

***

"I Have Heard"

the misuse of the word hope-
fully spread through the lin-

guistic landscape with the
steady relentless thrust of

lava from a volcano on here
one there at first but now

everywhere even senators &
professors   hopefully post

mortem meam I'll not end up
in a hell where undoubtfully

everyone will be saying it.

Through the black and the white may the brown and the green and the
pink always break.

here is small obituary running in pubishers weekly of james laughlin.
surely, more expansive notices will be running in newspapers tomorrow:

ObituaryJames Laughlin, founder of New Directions, author, poet and a
literary visionary who published the bulk of this century's most
distinguished experimental writers, died at his home in Norfolk, Ct. of
complications from a stroke Nov. 12. He was 83.By the time Laughlin
graduated from Harvard University in 1939, he had already begun
publishing the first of his New Directions anthologies in 1936 introducing
the early work of such writers as William Saroyan, Delmore Schwartz,
Celine, James Agee, Bertolt Brecht and Denise levertov and many others.
By the age of 18 he had published his own short stories and poetry in
the Atlantic Monthly. Not long after the New Direction anthology series
was launched Laughlin began publishing novels, plays and poetry
collections by authors of similar stature. The poetry of Tennessee
Williams and Karl Shapiro first appeared in these volumes and later the
poems of William Carlos Williams and Ezra Pound. During the late 1930s
and 1940s Laughlin published unprecendented translations of older,
influential European writers and is credited with reviving interest in E.M.
Forster and Kafka. The list goes on: He published Henry Miller's
idiosyncratic essays and travel books and was the first to print James
Joyce's Stephen Hero; brought Gertrude Stein; Nathanael West and
Herman Hesse back into print; and published Vladimir's Nabokov's
second novel, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight in 1941. None of this
has gone unnoticed and Laughlin's vision has been well honored.
Besides numeous honory degrees he has received commendations by
PEN, the American Academy of Arts and letters , The Carey Thomas
Award, The French Jean Malrieu prize for poetry in translation, The
Robert Frost Medal, the Curtis Benjamin Award for Creative Publishing
and many, many other honors. Laughlin has published numerous
volumes of his own poetry, essays and stories and New Directions will
publish The Love Poems this fall and he has three forthcoming books due
from Zoland Books, Aperture and Turkey press. W.W. Norton will also
publish a series of scholarly volumes of his correspondence with
various New Directions authors.

I’m not certain it’s all so dire. The Heath is direct
competitor of the venerable Norton anthology, is it not?
The Norton (4th Ed) has Michael Palmer (not really
a Language poet) and Edward Kamau Braithwaite
(who broadens the political & multi-cultural look of
the Norton contents page). But little else in the Norton
could be classified as language, alternative, EXP,
neoBeat, postmod, etc.

Fortunately there are other anthologies that a widely-read
teacher could press into service side-by-side or as alternative
to the Health/Norton "evil empire." Like Sun & Moon’s
Other Side of the Century, or Potes & Poets’ Art of Practice,
and Norton’s other anthology Post Modern Am. Poetry
edited by Paul Hoover.

I applaud Hank Lazer for trying to bring down the
leather-bound walls of the Heath, but success would
mean assimilation and thus brings with it other problems:
Namely the names. Who would get in and who wouldn’t?
Silliman, Hejinian, Bernstein, Armantrout, Watten, Scalapino,
Andrews, et al. And since Language (however it is defined
& explained) continues to be a dynamic force, a wave that
hasn’t yet crashed and dissipated upon the beach
of literary history, would not such recognition by the Heath
in some way break the movement’s natural course?

yep, it came thru fine -- (& proves more interesting in the instance
than I might've expected lacking the exempli).

Thinking of Terry Riley's composition *In C*, I find myself wondering
about computer-generated textual-composition possibilities of adding
letters incrementally -- (i.e., rather than always 16, if it were to
ascend -- e.g., from 4 to 6 to 8 etc.) -- a cumulative procedure of
growing complexity --

so you get circa 500,000 sentences (or lines) out of every run of
four 4-letter words, hmm --

have you ever started with words that themselves comprise a "found
phrase" of some sort? -- it would then seem a scramble from the
immediate-observed to every possible recombination of same --

these but passing thoughts, occasioned by novel procedure of a sort
I'd not considered --

look forward to seeing some more, whenever --

My concern was that we have such a split between aesthetic culture (of
varying kinds) and pop culture (of varying kinds) that the two are not
speaking to each other and people react to that. Hence my second comment:

I was trying to work out the idea that if people were responding to the
trace of a foreign aesthetic, or the way in which it manifested itself
within the parameters of their receiving technology (or culture), very
little communication is going to take place: what will be communicated will
be only a series of traces, which seem to me to be terribly short-lived and
unstable isotopes. Conservative poetry is a foreign aesthetic to most
people. Obscure poetry or avante-garde poetry might as well be a line of
binary code. It goes farther: even conservative poets, a sympathetic
audience (I would hope), are going to have a hard time reading avante-garde
poetry, because they will have to re-tool to do so. I think as readers we
tend to set up a receiving matrix and then are able to read texts (within
certain parameters) automatically. When we shift to a different type of
text (from conservative poetry to lang-po, for instance, or from Disneyland
sound-bites to T.S. Eliot) we will get messed up, because we will process
the signal automatically, but we will be processing it incorrectly. It will
be unreadable. A reader willing to do the work will correct this, by
switching to manual processing, then building up a new and more
sophisticated processing system, which can eventually process the material
correctly. A reader unwilling to do the work will walk away. Interesting is
the idea of an aesthetic willing to work with the traces themselves.
Probably need a lead suit, though.

I want to continue the (aborted) conversation on Watten's ILS lecture, "The
Bride of the Assembly Line," which I think is one of the most important
recent interventions in the debate about social possibilities of innovative
writing.  If Watten is right that "the avant-garde tradition of the material
text -- from Gertrude Stein and Luis Zukofsky to Clark Coolidge and Lee Ann
Brown -- has been misread in a way that is impoverished in terms of both
language and culture" (p. 3), then a lot of commentary on language poetry
and other types of innovative interventions need to be rethought.

The nub of Watten's argument is a critique of unspecified "possibility":

"It is, thus, claims for the possibility of form rather than the specificity
of form; or the possibility of language rather than a specific use of
langauge; or the possibility of critique instead of a specific politics; or
the possibility of difference rather tahn a specific difference, that
characterizes the current aporia of our collectively dialogic, site-specific
and time-valued, manifold poetics." (p.4)

It's obvious, I think, what is being talked about here.  I am reminded of
critical moments such as Andrew Ross's essay "The New Sentence and Commodity
Form" in Nelson and Grossman's _Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture_.
Somewhere in that essay (I may have the title wrong, as my copy is at home),
Ross quotes a poem (his examples are almost arbitrary) and says something
like (from memory now) "Finally, we get the sense that a fair deal has been
struck; the labor of reading is equal to the labor of writing."  This kind
of claim fits well into one of the things Watten is critiquing, namely "a
defunct politics satisfied to claim that the reader is 'empowered' to make
meaning from material texts" (p. 3)  The thing is, Ross's is a pretty
sophisticated argument, with a range of reference that runs back in Marxism
at least to Gramsci and in poetry to the Objectivist attention to texts as
"intellectual labor."  Watten and Ross share a lot of allegiances as well,
and are allied in the Watten issue of _Aerial_.  Still, Watten seems to be
aiming at some things that are present both in the Ross essay and by
extension, all over the place, especially in some academic treatments of
language writing such as Linda Renfield's, and and in the prose of our own
Charles Bernstein.

I am especially sympathetic to Watten's critique of Bernstein's sometimes
dismissive take on identity politics, which of course implicates lots of
discussions that have taken place on this list: "In Bernstein's tendency
toward a universalist, multinational politics of ideolectical writing, such
a blindspot of collective nonidentity seems motivated in a regional politics
of literary identity as much as it evidences a survival of the politics of
modernist form" (Watten p. 10).  There are other arguments and other wonders
in Watten's essay too (the discussion of Coolidge is great, as is [from my
limited knowledge] the whole riff on Stein and cars), but I thought I'd
highlight these moments in the essay to maybe light a fire under the list.

Poet:  Artist:  Intellectual ???

This is from an essay entitled "Surveillance and Spectacle in Fascist
Ferrara" by Diane Yvonne Ghirardo in the book of essays, "The Education of
the Architect:  Historiography, Urbanism, and the Growth of Architectural
Knowledge" edited by Martha Pollak.  I was reading it when this thread
started, and I think the thread has definitely come this way:
 social/political movements at the beginning of the century, the role of
culture in, the role of art in....

"[Antonio] Gramsci proposed a somewhat confused distinction between what he
referred to as organic intellectuals and traditional intellectuals, although
they were always linked to class distinctions.  The former, created by social
groups in the world of economic production, have the double function of
constructing homogenity and of developing awareness of the groups' social and
political functions beyond the specific economic ones.  Traditional
intellectuals already exist in a given society, and represent historical
continuity, while presenting themselves as autonomous of the dominant social
group.  Gramsci's important point is that both types of intellectual are
defined by their activities _within_ the system of social and class
relations.  The traditional intellectual operates within historically formed
categories which become more complex and elaborate in connection with the
dominant socal group.  In Gramsci's view, a new social group advancing toward
dominance, such as Fascism, makes one of its chief aims the assimilation of
traditional intellectuals, but also speeds up the process by producing its
own organic intellectuals.  In general, intellectuals serve as deputies with
the function of allowing the dominant social group to maintain hegemony
through the spontaneous consent of the masses. ... in the case of Fascist
Italy most of the cultural activities helped sustain Fascism's power. ... "

I think that the strategies of the Russian Revolutionaries vis a vis artists
and intellectuals can be usefully compared and contrasted with the strategies
of Italian Fascists, and the experiences of artists as well as their actual
work under both regimes usefully analysed as part of this discussion.

JamesLaughlion was the distinguised publisher of New Directions,which he
started as young man from his family's fortune in steel.  He went on to
publish most of the great modernists (Pound, Williams, etc) and to
champion progressive literature in general.  I knew J fairly well in the
1980s (after he got stranded in  a snowstorm and spent a weekend in
Chicago with me, Paul Hoover, and a menagerie of our small children) and
found him to be a very generous and witty man.  The press itself was a
real labor of love, as are all presses that start small.  He himself would
travel from town to town to sell books out of his car,and it wasn't until
much later when Tennessee Williams and Herman Hesse became well-known that
New Directions actually stabilized as a publishing house in terms of
monetary success.  But if he never made a dime, he would be remembered for
championing writers before they were well-known, including WCW who was
working in relative obscurity for many years.  Those on the list or
related to the list whom he
published--Creeley, Rothenberg, McClure, Howe, Mayer, Hoover, Gander,
Palmer, etc., and many poets through the small anthology "Language
Poetries" can
add far more. We saw the movie Gandhi with him and fed him his first bagel
during that Chicago stay.  We later stayed with him and his wife Anne,
now also deceased,one summer in CT  and enjoyed his wonderful library of
ND Books and 1st
editions.  I'll miss him.

is antiquity's language / content -- Pound seeking to promote an Ancient

I've only skimmed Watten's essay, find it provocative, but want more time to
think about it.  For starters though I'm tempted to ask that these "specific"
politics be named.  One target here is Charles Bernstein's Emersonianism.
When Barry read an early version of this paper in New Hampshire, as I recall,
he spontaneously added something like "No, I am not George Lukacs."  But I
wonder.

The critique of a discourse of a specially empowered reader in materialist
poetics has been offered before and for good reason, as for instance by J. H.
Prynne.  But this is a critique of critical frames and rationales more than
of poetic practice.

Watten's essay responds primarily to Bernstein's "Poetics of the Americas."
I wonder about this claim, which seems to acknowledge its fragility in its
idiom.  I don't know that I'd want to talk about "motivations" in the first
place, but I'm a little skeptical of the purported "universalism" located
in the essay.  There IS an effort to find common ground where it is rarely
sought. That seems a worthwhile project to me.  But "universalism" is a
strong claim in reading an essay that wants to "navigate between the
universalizing humanisms of internationalism and the parochialism of
regionalism and nationalism" while acknowledging that "our different
national and cultural circumstances are . . .marked in our poems" (3).
In my cursory first gallop through Watten's essay I note that "identity
politics" is called a "red herring," but here is what the CB essay says about
his Emersonian poetics and "identity":  "So I hope it will be apparent that
while I welcome the challenge of multiculturalism as it has entered U.S. arts
and education in the past decade, I continue to find many of its proponents
more interested in reinforcing traditional modes of representation than
allowing the heterogeneity of forms and peoples that make up the cultural
diversity of the Americas to transform poetic styles and personal and group
identities.  Yet it is hardly surprising that static conceptions of group
identity represented by authentic spokespersons continue to ride roughshod
over works and individuals whose identities are complex, multiple, mixed,
confused, hyperactivated, miscegenated, synthetic, mutant, forming, or
virtual" (3).  I leave it to you to decide whether this critique of identity
politics--or more exactly a version of it--is baited with a red herring. Hank
Lazer has recently mentioned the example of the Heath anthology.  Now it
might very well be the case that an opportunity for linking the progressive
purposes of specific discourses of identity politics and the politics of
difference with materialist poetics has been (so far) missed or obfuscated.
But in what sense is the CB claim above demonstrably "motivated in a regional
politics of literary identity"?  It's the word "regional" in particular that I
get stuck on.  The subtext, perhaps, is that CB is ONLY competing in an
aesthetic game for space in the Heath.  In the end that may be, sadly, true of
all of us--even those who made it in--but that would be a pretty bleak way of
looking at things and it certainly reads against the program articulated by
CB in the essay at hand, as if hunting an Adorno there.  Thus the remark about
"modernist form" perhaps--though I'll want to look again at Watten's essay
before standing by that connection.

One thing I am sure about--the Watten essay is an important provocation and
deserving of discussion.  David and Maria are right about that.  I wish I
had the time to do it justice, but I don't now. Maybe others will, but if it
is to be discussed in its relation to the Bernstein essay it is partly a
response to, I hope that folks will try to represent fairly both sides of
the argument, if an argument is what we've got.

CHARLES ALEXANDER

Charles Alexander’s  books of poetry include Hopeful Buildings (Chax Press,
Tucson, 1990) and arc of light / dark matter (Segue Books, New York, 1992).
Two chapbooks are forthcoming in winter 1998: Four Ninety Eight to Seven
from Meow Press (Buffalo, New York) and Pushing Water from Standing Stones
Press (Morris, Minnesota). He has also published reviews and critical
essays on contemporary literature and culture. He is the founder and
director of Chax Press, which was begun in Tucson, Arizona in 1984; Chax
moved to Minneapolis from 1993 through 1996, and returned to Tucson in the
summer of 1996. Chax is a publisher of handmade letterpress books and trade
literary editions, both of which explore innovative writing and its
conjunction with book forms. Through Chax Press, from 1986 to the present
Alexander has organized literary readings, talks, workshops and
presentations by artists. From 1993 through 1995 Alexander was executive
director of Minnesota Center for Book Arts, the nation’s most comprehensive
center for the arts of the book, both in terms of programs and artists’
studio facilities. As its director, Alexander completed the production of
the visual/literary artists’ book Winter Book in 1995 with visual artist
Tom Rose. In addition he directed educational programs and a variety of
artists’ residencies, creative productions, and other works. He was the
organizer and director of the 1994 symposium Art and Language: Re-Reading
the Boundless Book, one of the foundational symposiums in the recent
history of the book arts. From this symposium, he edited the formative
collection of essays, Talking The Boundless Book: Art, Language, and the
Book Arts (Minnesota Center for Book Arts, Minneapolis, 1996).

Alexander has given poetry readings, lectures, and workshops throughout the
country at colleges, universities, art centers, and other locations,
including at the University of Alabama, the University of Arizona, the
State University of New York at Buffalo, Painted Bride Arts Center in
Philadelphia, Small Press Traffic in San Francisco, Canessa Gallery in San
Francisco, the University of Washington, Pacific Lutheran University in
Tacoma, Scottsdale Center for the Arts, and many more. Alexander has also
performed poetry in galleries and art centers, has collaborated with
musicians and dancers, and in general brings to poetry a broad sense of
artistic and collaborative possibility.

Poet Robert Creeley writes that Alexander’s work "hears a complex literacy
of literalizing words. By means of a fencing of statements, sense is found
rather than determined. The real is as thought." And, concerning his 1992
book, arc of light/dark matter, the poet and critic Ron Silliman writes,
"Now Charles Alexander pushes the envelope of what is possible in writing
even further, to the ends of the universe. And beyond. . . This is the most
sensuous, intelligent, rewarding writing I’ve read in ages."

Alexander was born in Honolulu, grew up mostly in Norman, Oklahoma, was
educated at Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
and has lived in Tucson for most of the last 14 years, including at
present, with his wife Cynthia Miller, one of the premier visual artists of
the American Southwest.

The poet William Matthews died of a heart attack the same day as Laughlin.
While his poetics were not mine, he seemed like a nice enough fellow back when
he was living next door to David McAleavey's Ithaca home in 1970.

The example of Montale could be investigated (& has been) in relation to
the issues you raise (not to mention in connection with the renewed fire
under the Watten/Bernstein tango).  Montale was under attack for several
decades variously from left and right for "hermeticism"; in his poem
"Piccolo Testamente" (sp?) he renounces allegiance to either camp; in an
essay he criticizes the eagerness (the professional duty) of intellectuals
to take sides - or rather, he doesn't question their eagerness, but
questions their claim to being what he calls "free men".  I think he
means in this case "free artists".

David Kellogg says the Watten discussion was "aborted", and he's right:
my opening salvo was never answered (because out of the frame of this
discourse?).  I said the provocation Watten provides (between "soft" and
"hard" language poetry?) was vitiated by the apparent politicization of
art on both sides; the "return to context and authorial (political)
motivation" is simply a rehash in intellectually sexy terms of the
PERENNIAL dilemma of poetry - an autonomous activity - in a tangled
web of interests.  Poetry is BOTH "poetry per se" and steeped in
motivation and context, and this is absolutely nothing new.
Watten has done a signal service, though, in POINTING OUT THE OBVIOUS.

me, i'll stay out of the argument, if that's what it is, suggested by the
watten and bernstein pieces... i find both essays to coincide in many ways,
even if the emphases differ...

but to say that i found watten's discussion of norms valuable, and that i
think he's on target when he identifies norms as products as opposed to
"deductive schema," incl. his riff on "nonstandard norms"... this is
helpful specifically b/c it suggests that something can be done about norms
(e.g., do it y/ourselves), and that doing something about them may itself
become, if one isn't careful and as watten indicates, oppressive...

a very informative post, and one that makes me think twice. a publishing
company that was started because an aging fascist with enormous charisma

me and my friends????  sounds uncomfortably familiar, only usually a
certain gender difference plays a role, which it doesn't here, at least not

one thing i like about watten's critique not of charles but of aesthetic
universalism of any kind (and of course i adore charles so this is not
about personalities but about ideas, lest anyone jump all over me for being
disloyal to my listmaster) is precisely that; i value the eclecticism and
wide embrace of, say, "ethnopoetics" but have deep problems with the ethics
and politics of subsuming *certain* artifacts from "other cultures" under
an umbrella of "good poetry" to the exclusion of others, because of some
presumed norm (western-modernist-postmodernist) of what "good poetry" is,
without any regard for what is considered powerful utterance/good poetry in
the context that gave rise to that artifact or even, aesthetic
considerations aside altogether, why this artifact exists in the first
place, what were the circumstances of its production and how that affects
our access to it, reception of it, understanding of it.

Thanks.  We may indeed be closer than it first appeared.

Let me clarify.  I could imagine all sorts of investigations (evolutionary
and other) that might provide points of entry into various poetic
imaginings.  What I _don't_ think such investigations can do is provide
before-the-fact pre- or proscriptions as to what poetry might do in this
or that instance.  I don't think evolutionary psychology can do this in
any area of cultural activity (from war to lovemaking), because it is
impossible to separate the biological from the cultural.  Further,
separating biological from cultural materials always seems to end up
repeating a wheat/chaff sort of opposition that privileges the
biological.  Example: suppose I "discover" the biological roots of poetry,
and I write material that wilfully disengages from those roots, resists
them even, and call it poetry.  Would that resistance disqualify calling
my engagements "poetry"?

Cheers,
David

Subject:      things happened in Providence

Last night Peter Johnson and Susan Grant read at Hall Library in Cranston.
Peter Johnson is an independent character from Buffalo no less (he just heard
about the EPC in his home town) who edits PROSE POEM, is an example
of someone with a very clear focus who manages to solicit, read & select
from over 5000 prose poems a year for his mag.  He gave a very tight
entertaining reading of his own & others' work.

Susan Grant edits an annual called the NEWPORT REVIEW; this may have been
her first reading.  Poetry is great as a vehicle for FREE EXPRESSION,
in this it's like medicine.  Among other more serious things she read
a poetic epistle to one of our Rhode Island state senators, Patrick Kennedy,
from a woman sitting in a "clean" laundry basket, asking why oral sex
was against the law in RI.

The Hall Library has just agreed to catalog Poetry Mission materials
for permanent housing there, a good sign, so thank you all again who made
donations to the seed collection, they will be in good hands!  We hope
it becomes a good resource here.

Keith Waldrop also read in Providence last night, but for obvious reasons
I couldn't be there. - Henry Gould

is it possible?

i.e. is it possible to understand that 'sufficiently'?

that word contingent again again.

in any case. or even if in one case how many more than one can one. it seems
information coagulates/constellates but implicit in the questioning is the
possibility of a knowledge one can attain yes?

rather say, perhaps this is close to Watten-- the form is the knowledge, in
its _movement_, one's experience of that movement.

from XYZ of Reading: "We question a question in order to fill in its form."

tho of course in bureaucratise that is exactly what one must not do, you just
fill out the form, _their_ form.

so perhaps looking at seriality, questioning its form, of utmost these days.

ladies & gentlemen,

could I trouble someone to identify the source (book? journal?) of
the articles being discussed here -- one by B. Watten, one by Ch.
Bernstein, evidently --
somehow I missed that info (if it were stated) --
thanks,

Sorry to insert such a mundane point into what's a very interesting
argument to lurk in, but could someone either post or backchannel the full
bibliographical details of the Watten essay?  I have some investment in
this argument, but am loath to step forward having not read the main
occasion, so to speak . . .

Thank you,

Does anyone out there know anything about what's happening in Swedish
poetry?    I'll be at Lund University next year and would like to
connect with the poetry community, about which I know almost nothing
(though I did once read the old Swallow Press book _Contemporary Swedish

Subject:      whistlers

good day folks.  recently the omega stations were shut down.  they used to
send beeps to navigators around the world.  the antenna on ohahu was over a
mile long and initially i thought it to be a large stretching of high tension
wires strung over big big gorge on windward mountain.

here's a description of the end of omega by one of those long wave nerds.

Bill L . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Omega shut down! Here's a copy of my report e-mailed to a few other people
and also a spectrogram made of the tape:

Well, I got a nice recording of Omega's last beeps and also two nights of
nice whistlers too, especially this morning, 01 October, between 1100-1330
UT. There was also some intermittant dawn chorus starting at about 1230 UT
and going until after 1500 UT - I had not yet caught chorus this summer or
fall until now, so I was really glad to hear some chorus even though it was
not very strong, and overall a really nice 2 days of whistler listening. Many
whistlers this morning (October 01) had echoes too! The whistlers seemed to
be generated by fairly nearby lightning - not too local but within 1000
miles.

I have found that indeed (and this is shown in a more recent book on
magnetospheric physics), whistlers don't follow exact paths and congugate
points AT ALL(!!!). Often, loud whistlers at any locale may be generated by
lightning somewhat far away (1000-2000 miles perhaps) while more closeby
lightning is NOT generating the loudest whistlers (which may be loud 1000
miles away somewhere ELSE!) Listening since mid-august has given me quite a
bit of observation in this regard and countless examples on tape. I mentioned
this somewhat subjectively in my VLF STORY I wrote a few years back and I'm
even more sure of this. Sooo, Mexican or Montanan lightning may make LOUD
California whistlers, and at the same time California lightning may make for
loud whistlers in Colorado or even Kansas (to use a scenario). Certainly,
there are times when nearby lightning does make for the loudest whistlers,
but this is more infrequent in my observations than the scenario above.

Anyway back to Omega's shutdown--I started recording at 0257 UT 9/30. I made
a WWV time check at 0259 on the tape and then let it run with the WR-4b
whistler receiver set to high-pass--lots of Omega into the tape recorder. At
about 0259:30, Omega D (North Dakota) shut down, leaving Omega-C Hawaii going
for about 2-3 more of its cycles. About 0300 (or within a few seconds) and
after its two 11.8 kHz beeps, Omega C went off. Both D and C did not shut off
abruptly, but did a sort of 'fade-out' over a 1-2 second period.
Interestingly, going over the tape in slow motion revealed a third, very weak
Omega station running on until a minute or so later - the 10.2 kHz beep was
noticed. Probably H-Japan, the next strongest station here in Califirnia
usually.

By 0301 UT, all that was left was the Russian Alpha system - short beeps in
clusters of three beeps, a pause, then three beeps again in downward
frequency steps. Russian Alpha is much weaker and higher up in frequency (up
to 14.1 kHz) then Omega was and has a far lower duty-cycle, and so the
natural radio band is really MUCH cleaner sounding suddenly! It's also fun to
observe Alpha propagation - I guess the strongest one I get is from
Siberia--it is stronger toward sunrise than at any other time of the day by
3-6 dB or so.

The spectrogram above shows Omega Station "D" North Dakota, and Omega Station
"C" Oahu, Hawaii with their last beeps. Recorded on my van-based WR- 4b VLF
receiver with 2 meter whip antenna up 3 meters high. The tape was made on a
Marantz PMD-212 with cromium tape and the WR-4b in high-pass/emphasis mode.

The tape was copied into a sound file at 44.1 kHz/16 bit. Then it was FFT
filtered in Coolwave 1.5 and 9 to 14 kHz was emphasised by 15 dB. Then I ran
a spectrogram on it and then edited the spectrogram adding the labels.

Notice that there is a weak short-beep station transmitting - that is Russian
Alpha.

There are supposedly three(?) stations in the Alpha chain. Does any reader
know of info on the Russian Alpha system - locations, frequencies and format?
Certainly, Alpha is going to continue for a while and it is going to be
noticed by some listeners even though it is fairly weak. I'd like to put
Alpha information into the WR-3/3E VLF Listening Guide and the VLF Listener's
Handbook replacing the Omega info.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


More about the defunct Omega Radio Navigation System is in the WR- 3/3E
LISTENING GUIDE Under the Omega section. This will not remain in the Guide
for too much longer.

Keith, you're right to point out the need to bring Bernstein's piece
directly into the conversation, instead of peripherally.  I'll do that
when I have it on hand (don't right now).

Joe Amato is also right to point out that there are lots of convergences
between the approaches.  Watten's take-no-prisoners style has always, to
me, stressed differences that assume a ground of agreement which some
might not recognize.  It's part of his way of making conversation.

As to the "red herring" issue.  It might or might not be accurate to
charge Bernstein's essay in this way; however, I think it's not off the
mark to suggest a certain visible tendency in the way arguments are
carrried out over issues such as the Heath turf wars.  Way back as far as
Ron Silliman's _The New Sentence_, the point about competition among
excluded poetries for "slots in the metanetwork" was being made by writers
associated with the language movement; while Ron is about as pluralist a
poet as I know, and has emphasized the specificity of his approach in more
recent essays (like the one in _The Politics of Poetic Form_), identifying
the institutional issue as important is both right and problematic. What
Watten is trying to do here, I think, is intervene in a way that prevents
the politics of poetry from being reduced to a merely literary politics.
In that sense, he reads Bernstein as symptomatic, even though, as we all
know, they have more in common than many other poets.

Watten's piece and Bob Perelman's Marginalization have this in common:
they represent a continuation of some debates that took place in the
seventies, but in a new context: now that language writing is being
academically recognized, that continuing debate is -- can't help but be --
(mis)recognized as fragmentation.

Cheers,
David

maria,
Whether or not you agree with who he published, Laughlin's contributions to
20th Century literature are immense.  Keep in mind that it is due in large
part to Laughlin that you can pick up much of Hermann Hesse's work at your
local library.

Warning!!!

As soon as I saw Charles Alexander's accidentally-posted bio, I grabbed
it for my poetry-data-collection site, Comprepoetica.  That's 'cause I'm
running scairt.  Hardly anyone has filled out my survey form for a whole
week--though Rochelle Ratner just did one, to my great relief.

P.S., I did check with Charles about using his excellent, interesting
bio, and he okayed it.  (But I might have used it even if he hadn't
okayed it, so watch out!  I can be pretty terrible.)

The real point: if you have any bio of yourself (or someone else who's a
poet or critic or publisher of poetry or anything related to poetry,
feel free to send it to Comprepoetica rather than (or along with)
filling out my survey form.  I do need bios for credibility.  I'm up to
24 in slightly over a month of operation, which is good but should be
better.  Oh, and some still haven't been processed so exist as raw data
only.  You can still access them under their subjects' names, which are
indexed at my site.

brent: you seem to have missed my point, which was not to chide laughlin
for being a publisher (you may have noticed i was among the first to
respond to marjorie's post), but to chide pound for (if the anecdote is
accurate) suggesting laughlin give up his own writing in order to devote
his considerable talent and resources to publish --surprise surprise
--pound himself.  i said it sounded like the same old, though usually
gendered, story: "honey, don't do your own writing, give up everything to
support ME and MY writing." it is good to hear from others that laughlin
did not entirely abandon his own writing after all.

Mary,

If this gets to you in time, perhaps you can send my regards to Stephen
Ratcliffe, who I published several times in a magazine I did in the late
eighties, _Peninsula_. Tell me to send me an e-mail or two!

I didn't know about your magazine. Are you accepting stuff these days?
Just finished a new long poem that I think might feel comfortable in
your pages.

Anyway, hope tonight's a success!

Best,

Joe Safdie

The short time traces have always been unavoidable in poetry (even desirable I
might think; a lot more than we can quantify gets communicated in short
spaces). This is subtlety and something for poets of the now and the future to
develop.

Interesting observation, Maria. Pound was, I suppose, nothing if not
patronizing. This tendency to lord it over "lesser mortals" seems over to
time to have become magnified into his psychosis. Funny thing is though, I
can't think of a better word to describe the institutionalized sexism you
allude to. And this remark from Pound to JL by the same poet who satirized
such patronizing attitudes in "Hugh Selwyn Mauberly":  "... and give up
poetry, my boy, there's no money in it."

a very informative post, and one that makes me think twice. a publishing

Safdie,

just heard Stephen read at a Russian River Writers Guild reading here in
Sonoma County.  he was excellent.  he read from new works, then all
talked with him about his writing.  I see he has at least 15 books...and
I came home with one of them (Sculpture), kindly signed.  He also asked
me to subscribe him to our poetry email list Socopoet.  nice.

Quotes from Herbet Schneidau, SACRED DISCONTENT:

Myth...is a kind of cultural glue; in this aspect, perhaps, it is to men
what mutual grooming is to apes.

Christianity attacks human life at so deep a level that it disallows all
existing culture. (Amos N. Wilder)

God deliberately gave Israel bad laws "which was to punish them, so that they
would learn that I am the Lord." (Jeremiah)

There are no great Hebrew culture heroes who found cities: in fact it is
questionable whether there are "Hebrew" cities at all. (Herbert Schneidau,
a.k.a. Jack Spandrift)

Though I count myself innocent, it may declare me a hypocrite. (Job)

Now the ordinary man in society - and Hebrew society was no exception - cannot
live comfortably with the suspicion that his acts are meaningless; therefore,
as Isaiah says, he hears but does not hear.

As Hosea notes, many of the utterances sound like "raving" to the ordinary
man.  But Ezekiel, who had long periods of trance and aphasia, seems the most
likely target for long-distance psychoanalysis.

Recently many studies have stressed the usefulness of aggression in stabilizing
social structures; hen's pecking orders and baboons' dominance patterns furnish
provocative analogies to such groups as the Eddystone Islanders, whose
mythology served to order and control the aggression which, when suppressed,
may rot the cultural fiber.  No doubt similar relations between mythology
and violence were widespread in man's early millenia... (Burnwatt Charstein)

...in spite of all the tomes that have been written on So-and-so's "use of the
Bible", the point is how the Bible uses authors, not vice versa.

The significant lack of myth in the Bible may have much to do with its
unsettling effect. (Herbert Schneidau)

Hi David,

Yes on the "merely literary politics" business, but a cynic might say that
insofar as the first agenda in BW's essay is arguing the necessity of a
"cultural poetics" BW is "merely" caught up in a methodological "turf war"
and one primarily situated in the academy.  Though by the terms of the essay
there would be no such thing as "merely" as the victorious and vanquished
discourses and tastes, the standard/hegemonic and non-, would both be
products within the social totality and not necessarily opposed or in a
binary formation.  Or so he seems to be saying tho I'm cryptic here.  And
yes too of course on BW and CB having more in common than others but the
target is not so much CB's practice or even for that matter his poetics
so much as the modernism/modernity distinction BW sees perpetuated in Altieri
especially but also in CB. BW's "social reflexivity" as against Altieri's
"reflexive consciousness" comes clear, as does the contingency and non-
translatibility (god what a word if it is one) of BOTH the normative/non-
normative distinction AND "identity politics."  (Once saw a french scholar
shake his head befuddled when I tried to explain how that phrase usually
means in the US, and by the way I was a little unfair to BW yesterday as
there's a discussion in his essay of CB's reading of McKay that acknowledges
that CB is grappling with these issues.)

I think that down the road it's likely that BW means to "argue" with Greenblatt
and the fact that that's just a footnote here is just a little frustrating.
Though the point of disagreement is clear:  BW believes the author returns
in Greenblatt's cultural poetics in less-than-useful ways, even while he
sides with Greenblatt's project in other ways.

I take it that the most useful provocations here turn on several sentences I'll
now quote for those who don't have the essay--you'll have read them.  No time
to comment on them now.  Maybe later.  In the event that I can't find the time
I'll go on record as saying that when BW writes that "seeing the material text
as cultural production may lead to new vistas of comprehension, and to new
and as yet unanticipated forms of participation" I want to agree with the
first proposition while noting that the last is both hortatory and hopeful,
dare I say "impossibly" utopian.  It may be true that the most political thing
that langpo did was not disrupt the norms of poetic practice or hybridize
genre or whatever but build institutions, networks of exchange, and etc.
which acknowledged the collectivity and "social reflexivity" of poetic
practice, and it may be that we need to be reminded that "there's no outside"
as the cliche goes, but the idea that a "cultural poetics" will produce
new forms of participation--well that's hopeful. And there's more to say. Now
for those who ask for more text & w/ the reminder that one can dial up Steve
Evans and get the whole thing here's a few passages.  [Oh and the CB is
_Modernism/Modernity 3.3 (September 1996), from Johns Hopkins UP.]

"The trouble with self-reflexivity as the value of form, in this sense, is
that it insists on imagining itself as apart from the world that constitutes
it.  One can only read oneself out of the world" (34). [One might italicize
"read"]

"Norms are products, not deductive schema of oppressive rationality, although
they can be used for oppressive ends.  Nonstandard norms are also produced;
they are not simply defined against the abstraction of normativity.  The work
of the language School, if produced within a system of social feedback
necessary for meaning and comprehension, may in turn end up reproducing
itself as a new norm.  If this were to happen, a nonstandard mode of expression
might simply be inserted into the space of a vacated norm of the expressive
lyric" (33). [Big word here would be "if"?]

"The assembly line is a form of modernity that was never 'invented.' Likewise
the Language School had no authorial origins, but began as a sequence of
'improvements' within the form of organization that developed between writers
in _This_" (19).

Maria,
Ordinarily I would agree with your assessment.  But Pound was famous for
helping any and all poets whose work he thought was serious (that includes
women, by the way), and he often did so before promoting his own work.
For all his faults, he was hugely generous, even to those who were not
his friends or with whom he did not agree politically.  Laughlin would say
so himself.

Pound was not always right, but my guess is that he sincerely
felt that Laughlin didn't have it in him to be a poet.  Sometimes he
didn't think he had it in him to be a publisher either, judging from some
of his letters to Jay complaining about the amount of time he spent on the
ski slopes instead of getting the books out.

I would say that there have been few poets as generous with other artists.
Patricia

i can't help but express my dismay at the perhaps utterly blind reductivism
of summing up laughlin's life in terms of his connection with pound only
and further summing up pound as "an aging fascist."  To mirror people
like marianne moore and more recently alfred kazin, let me say that i
too dislike pound--but i also recognize his genius, and as a literary
historian of a sort his huge influence on 20th century poetry and criticism.
i recall a wonderful closing line of a poem by joel oppenheimer's called
"for the barbers": "oh the / professionals what we / should fear."
also, i can't help but tentatively advance the idea that some at least
period of dignified mourning should perhaps be observed before we start
on the really cutthroat postmortems.

I don't think maria meant to reduce JL's life this way, but the post
_did_ have that effect.  (Sorry md: gotta call 'em as I see 'em.)

Besides, when Laughlin met Pound, Pound was neither old nor demonstrably a
fascist (yet).

I wouldn't want to reduce Zukofsky, or Olson, or Bunting, in this way --
those who have done so mainly want to dismiss those writers from literary
history.

Why is it easier with a person labelled "publisher" than simply "poet"?
What about "critic"?  Will Hugh Kenner's life and work, when he dies, be
similarly reduced to his visiting Pound at the urging of Marshall
McLuhan? I hope the hell not.

Cheers,
David

My apologies to Maria if I took a remark of hers that was quoted by someone
else out of context.  I'm afraid I may have been hasty and I guess I ought
to resist wading in with off the top of my head opinions when I am busy
enough with other things so that I am not carefully sifting through the

Hi Maria & Pat--
Of course, the "Mauberley" comment is directed by a publisher at a poet,
and relates, not to the quality of the poet's work, but the very
desirability of pursuing poetry as a genre--it's simply not economically
rewarding.  Pound never told Jay Laughlin not to write cuz he wouldn't get
rich or make a living at it, but because he believed that Laughlin simply
didn't have the talent or sensibility ever to be very good at it.  (I
think he was more or less right--I've read a lot of Laughlin's poetry, and
I can't recall a single one of the poems that sticks in my mind as
particularly
good.  I suppose it would be way uncool for me to characterize his work as
relentlessly _minor_, but most of it falls right into the category of
personal, voice-based lyric that most of us on the list seem to dislike
and find retrograde.  What I _do_ find intermittently interesting is his
typewriter-space based prosody--each line determined by the number of
spaces, rather than syllables or words.  But that doesn't keep me reading
the poems.)
        You draw a fascinating parallel, Maria, but what's the
significance?  Pound tells Laughlin not to write; Emerson leaves Emma
Lazarus out of Parnassus.  So what?  The latter may well be a case of
sexism, the former certainly isn't.  Does his treatment of Laughlin mean
we should discount
Pound's immense aid and sponsorship of younger poets?  Go back and reread
the letters to Mary Barnard and Iris Barry in Pound's _Selected Letters_
if you want to say something about the gendered basis of Pound's
mentorship practices.  (Of course, it may be a class thing--Pound
dismissing Laughlin's work as a rich boy's dilletantism--but I suspect
that we're much less willing to rush to the defence of the well-endowed
minority.)  Sorry, but I find it odd that, in a moment when everyone is
striving to say nicenesses about Laughlin's position in 20th-century
poetry publishing, you want to bend over backwards to make Pound's
dismissal of his work somehow symbolic of male poets' squashing female
poets' talents.  Sadly, it happens all the time--but it didn't happen
here, and Laughlin's publishing track record shows that, of small press
publishers in the US, he wasn't particularly guilty of that sin.
best,
Mark Scroggins

again, i take this as a serious misreading of my intention and my words
themselves.  i admire laughlin's contributions tremendously and did not
belittle him thru association w/ pound, as anyone reading the words on the
screen might have realized.  my objections were leveled at pound.  if the
anecdote is accurate, i stand by my observation.  if it is not, i will
reconsider.

hmm, interesting.

     I rapped my knuckles on the front door. It was fabricated from
     many layers of wood. So many layers that I couldn't get a
     sure knock. The sound I did make was nothing more than the
     rustling of kisses in a close hallway at night.

 - Easy Rawlins (Mosley's privite eye character), in *Black Betty*

Other than Chandler and Hammett, Walter Mosley happens to be the only
mystery writer I've taken an interest in reading in recent years.  So
I appreciate getting this little, unexpected  anecdotal backgrounder, Joel.

Haven't kept up with Mosley's work, but recent reviews indicate some
branching out from mystery genre (& from Easy Rawlins).  As noted in
the NYT Book Review by Sven Birkerts (Nov. 9 '97) (at:
http://search.nytimes.com/books/search/bin/fastweb?getdoc+book-rev+boo
k-r+22253+6++%27Walter%20Mosley%27 ) --

          Assigning his protagonist, Socrates Fortlow, the name of the
          father of Western philosophy, Walter Mosley has, in ''Always
          Outnumbered, Always Outgunned,'' set out to explore the
          implications of moral action in a society that has lost all
          purchase on the spirit of the law. This, Mosley's eighth
          work of fiction, makes a striking departure from the
          familiar event-driven world of Easy Rawlins. The 14 loosely
          linked vignettes and tales incorporate the Platonic
          dialogues as a kind of ghost melody; signature strains of
          the classic are vamped up in the rough demotic of
          present-day Watts.

yes, exactly, -- that was something I sensed in the 14 lines you
posted -- especially after realizing (on re-reading) that you'd
assembled the lines so as to have something approaching syntactic
meaning (i.e., readability beyond the level of the line); that you'd
taken care with punctuation, to suggest that; and that, too, the
resultant composition could be thought to comprise a sonnet.

On the perennial topic of chance v. choice, I recall the feisty
composer Lou Harrison commenting (vis-a-vis John Cage), in a
curmudgeonly manner -- but memorably withal -- "I'd rather chance a
choice than choose a chance."  This was, I think, a remark he whipped
out on the spot, when I was chatting with him after the premier of
what Harrison styled his "final symphony" (at BAM some years ago) --
a line that seemed rehearsed, yet witty enough to seem charming
(one's admiration for Cage notwithstanding).

There are so many ways in which both chance & choice can have scope,
it seems -- and their combination (with, as you say, constraint) seems,
to me, eminently human (even when, as here, drawing on the potential
of the latest gizmotry).

Thanks much for the offer of y our recent publication (will send
snail address under separate e).

If any of you contribute to TIAA-CREF retirement accounts, when you get a
ballot in the mail, I urge you to vote yes on shareholder proposal 4, which
seeks to widen the impact of the Social Choice  account by investing in
companies that make a positive social and environmental impact  rather than
just screening out negatives.  (On the ballot itself, TIAA-CREF actually
recommends voting no, which I fine unconscionable.  )  Relevant info below.

If I am reading Maria's response right, the part that's hard to swallow
has nothing to do with whether Pound's assessment of Laughlin's talent was
accurate or not. The annoying thing is the hierarchically-based arrogance
that made Pound feel entitled to attempt to coopt someone else's life that
way.  And the really annoying thing is that this is the kind of move  that
has gotten so many male poets published, no matter what the gender of the
coopted ones; this is.  I had the exact same visceral reaction to the
anecdote that Maria reported.  And no amount of rationalization about
Laughlin's talent--or the eventual size of his impact on the current state
of literary affairs--will change the truth that gives rise to such visceral
reactions.

Re:  Pound and Laughlin,

Pond has never been a favorite of mine and I must plead ignorance of
Lauglin, but would say that if Laughlin had followed Pound's advice and
stuck just with just publishing, then it would mean that Laughlin would
have either realized his heart wasn't in writing or he was a weak willed
individual easily swayed by Pound and others.  In any event, if he had
chosen only to publishe, would the literary world have missed his written
work?

Overall I think Pound was an amazing artist who was also a creep.
Laughlin's range of artists - from Osamu Dazai to Blaise Cendrars to H.D.
to Mishima to an early anthology of language poetry is simply amazing.  New
Directions is great, and I shutter to think that such a publishing house
wouldn't exist.  So whatever it was Pound or Laughlin (and I would think
Laughlin was simply a genius of an editor) we should all just pause for a
second and give thanks to the spirit of Laughlin.  And really, I don't
think we should give Pound too much credit in regards to Laughlin, New
Directions, etc.

Miekal,

I visited your visual poem and found it most interesting.  The tying
together of the visual and moving images with the written offers a
powerful means of expressing.  Unfortunately, I was unable to stay
connected long enough to load all the images, my service provider's local
dial access is having problems and keeps dropping me.

Have you, or anyone you are aware of, integrated sound (either music,
noises, or reading of the poetry, even a combination) together?
Unfortunately, visual and/or sound integrated poetry awaits faster
connection speeds before it will work well, I'm afraid.  Also, we all
need more bandwidth.

Jerry.

Laughlin surely does raise the spectre of Pound once again, if only to remind
us of how much of Pound's work was simply putting people in touch with one
another. Listening to the Laughlin obit on All Things Considered the other
night, who do I hear but ol' Ez hisself, reading "Mauberly," which the
narrator stated "could have been written about Laughlin."

While I tend to think of New Directions as a publisher who ran out of gas by
the early 1960s (the recent additions to its list of writers, even including
Creeley nearly a quarter of a century ago, have for the most part been already
established figures), its impact in carrying modernism into the 1940s and 50s
cannot be underestimated.

Good to know that he provided for the continuation of the press.

Last night at the winter league game between the Honolulu Sharks and the
Maui Stingrays, the former Philly Phanatic (now sporting the rather dull
moniker of "Sport") was spotted buffing list member Bill Luoma's bolohead
not once, but twice.  On the second go-round, he applied squeegee and a
tiny plunger to help him in his task.  Bill was then presented with an
autographed card of Sport, but not the one showing the mascot pinching a
base coach's bum--that one was strangely reserved for the under 10 crowd.
But by far the best venue for baseball on this island (Juliana, Bill, and
I will attest to this) is the choicely named Hans L'Orange Park in
Waipahu, where the West Oahu Cane Fires play their home games.  At that
park, a collection is taken up from the crowd for the private use of any
Cane Fires player who hits one home run, lidat!

an odd crossing of Marianne Moore's famous opener of "Poetry," as the
review in todays NYT Book Review of her letters reveals that despite her
lifelong opposition to antisemitism and her deploring of his positions, she
did in fact personally like Pound.

I also happened to hear the voice of Pound reciting on the J. Laughlin
piece on NPR.  & the strange thing was, later that night I watched an
early Satyajit Ray film called "Devi", which includes a brief scene in
which the senile, goddess-obsessed patriarch recites from memory some
sacred Sanskrit verse to his upstart son - & he sounds like Ol' Ez.

Just to insert something into the discussion, peripherally. Eliot had a
different take on manipulative mentor mania.

As I remember it, he once said that whenever a young writer asked him
whether he or she should become a writer he responded "No." His explanation
was that if someone was going to be a writer then he or she would discount
what he (Eliot) said as being stupid and go on writing anyway, and if that
person was not committed to the task then he had saved them a lot of grief.

Makes me wonder what didn't get written because of that.

No, I did not mean subtlety. I meant that the discrepancy between
traditions of culture (and also of poetic cultures) can be so great that
when work moves from one to the other it is completely misread, and that
this mis-reading then becomes the code by which the piece is discussed. An
intended revolution is not going to take place this way. There will be a
revolution, but it will be through the traces, and moreso, and this is what
concerns me, through the cultural biases which led to the misrepresentation
in the first place. The piece is not being read, in other words, only the
response to the piece is being read, and that response consists only in the
way in which the piece fits into established cultural criteria. Now, this
seems to me to be the way things work, and it also seems to me that
problems can occur when we insist on reading an unreasoned response as if
it is a reasoned one.

William, you said:

>And a quiet revolution has taken place.

Yes, but only if we have a reader willing to do the work, and my point was
that it is easy to have a reader not willing to do the work, because the
work has already been dismissed, not out of malice, but because of
contrasting languages.

When I suggested there could be a poetry of the traces, I was thinking of a
way of getting around this problem of mis-reading (or, rather non-reading)
by using the material of that non-reading as the basis of the poem.

Then again, maybe that's what you meant, too.

Insofar as Pound goes, though I would not be one to support his facism, I
do think the 13 years he spent locked in the hospital after the war was
more than a bit excessive punishiment.  As to his poetry...its punctuated
with greatness, but also often dissolves in nothingness.

What, no requiem for Allen Ginsberg?  Burroughs, tho, had pretty much

a tragedy is a child prodigy dead of rosin poisoning in Carnegie Hall on
New Years Eve. A premature death is terribly sad, terribly disturbing,
unspeakably factual, perhaps a catastrophe, and surely for those most
intimately concerned, a catastrophe, a disaster; but it is not a tragedy.
In the presence of death, let us be true to our words. I myself find this
news incredible, which is perhaps what makes Jerry Fletcher utter the term
"tragedy". Certainly to me she is so much younger, that I find her
condition dizzying. It feels like "only the other day" that her
home-published "Tales of the Black Tarantula" began slipping thru my
mailslot. Little did we suspect then what fame & notoriety she would
happily achieve. She "went for broke" in a big way, an utterly american
way, & people loved her for it. And still do. And who knows, maybe she will
pull thru. The word I heard last week, in San Diego, was that she is in a
clinic in Tiajuana, where the less-stringent laws of Mexico permit more
venturesome treatments than one can obtain here. She has metastisized
cancer, I heard; a tough prognosis, but where there's life, who can
surrender possibility? I surely hope she isn't on this List!

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

A catalog of literary hoaxes covers the front page of the second section
of this past weekend's Financial Times, and list-subjects Yasusada, Ern
Malley and Alan Sokal make up the bulk of the second half of the article.
Way to go team! Demidenko, Paul Theroux and Ossian, hoaxers not yet
broached here are touched on, and Chatterton and Bob Hershon's public
school students are left out. Just thought I'd mention it, since Kent
Johnson seems to have taken a vacation from the Yasusada updates.

Rather than pick apart where Watten claims to diverge from Bernstein (and
by swerving out of that collision path, to avoid assessing the accuracy of
his paraphrase and the validity of either set of remarks, more work than a
Tuesday-after-holiday) I'll just register my amusement at the Grenier /
Coolidge split, which Watten predicates on a reading of Grenier's "hate
speech" as requiring a description of some instantaneous burst of thought
(apparently very close to what Ginsberg late in his teaching described
'first thought best thought' as meaning), and also on a comparison of
Coolidge to Henry Ford. Leaving aside Watten's remark that Ford's
development of the assembly line was "idiot simple", and letting sit like
a heap of dung the perpetuation of that sort of academic ad hominem
moronism, I'd like to ask the list what distinction Watten is making when
he refers to some texts as "social texts". I'm aware that this is the name
of a (recently hoaxed) journal edited by Andrew Ross. Then what do I do.
Is this listserv a social text? Then are anonymous or unpublished works
anti-social texts? oooooooooo baby baby. It was pleasant to put together
words and think there was something post-industrialist about it.

To Paul Lauter,

First of all thank you for allowing this discussion of the Heath to include you
as its editor.  Now, that said, allow me to submit the idea that, perhaps
today more than ever, an anthology is a powerful influence on the literary
canon, given the logistics college instructors usually face--much in the way
that dictionaries legitimize usages (a recent student of mine pointed out to
me that he very well COULD spell "through" as "thru" inasmuch as his dictionaryy, a Webster if I recall, albeit maybe not a direct descendent of Noah Webster,
had "thru" as an alternative spelling of the word).  I can't count how many times
i've had to exclude important poets from courses because I couldn't really ask
my students to buy these poets' books AND an anthology.

If the social is a text, is the text a social?  Can we meet with the Methodists

Bravo to the poets involved with supporting this effort.

In essence, Standard, the situation began just because of a basic
organizing effort.  As *always* with labor struggle these days, health
benefits have a lot to do with with why the workers want a union...But so
do wages, dignity, basic control of their own lives, basic rights.  The
issue is essentially the right to organize: the most basic right there is.

This isn't really a reply to Burt's post--I'm attaching because I like his
tack and wish to extend it for Paul Lauter's consideration. Every time I
teach a poetry course I create my own xerox anthology. I don't think I'm
alone in this. That enriches Kinko's, but not Heath. It also makes my life
a lot more difficult.
Anthologies influence the canon as perceived by teachers as well as
students, not only because they legitimize but because they give access to
material that might otherwise be unfamiliar. Even the unconverted prof
might be prone to select an anthology that offers some novelty to teacher
and student.
I think this is a case where virtue need not be its own reward--a more
inclusive anthology makes bottom-line sense.

And in this democracy any group is invisible at best until it's recognized
as a voting bloc, which is what Clinton was up to. Whether his speech was
flaccid or had a hard-on it's difficult for me to see it as anything but a
good thing, although one could certainly ask for more.

A democracy is based on the idea that since none of us knows what's best
for us, we had better decide together about it.  A representative
democracy is based on the idea of trust - i.e., we will delegate authority
because too many cooks spoil the Water Supply Board.  A social democracy,
I thought, was based on the idea that private property doesn't know what's
good for us any more than we do. - Henry Gould

As part of the Laughlin-Pound conversation, someone mentioned Eliot on
"mentorship." It put me in mind of what allegedly happened when Spender
met Eliot for the first time: Eliot said he could understand why Spender
would want to write poetry, but that he didn't understand what it meant
to want to (as Spender apparently put it) "be a poet."

Sunday night at Naropa the annual Fall faculty reading was finally held, an
earlier date having been called on account of blizzard.

Andrew Schelling read first. He began with an extract from the forthcoming
travel journal  _The Road to Ocassino: A Chiapas Journal_, which gave a
fluid account of an old Nahuatl treatise on flowers & song, hallucinogens
and poesis, and their convergence in "the luminous sphere of poetry." "But
ah, when the mushroom wears off, one returns to daily life - restless,
disconsolate." Next he read from a delightful series of Haibuns - a hybrid
form of prose and haiku. These crisp meditations on Coloradan geological and
natural features moved by way of sharp, immediate, precise and bright
details and included a playful and very effective section that dwelt on the
odd conventions of place-naming - "A town called Rifle. A gulch called
Skeleton." The section ended with a haiku for Ginsberg:

Old masters depart,
spring flowers return, haze
hangs blue by high peaks.

(Not an exact syllable count - either I missed a beat, or it's intentional).

Schelling closed with a selection of droll, piquant translations from
Sanskrit love poems.

Anne Waldman began her reading by observing somewhat mordantly that
"everyday seems like Memorial Day around here." In honor of what would have
been Ted Berrigan's 63rd birthday, she then read his "Sonnet 23," and "In
Anselm Hollo's Poems." Next in the marche funebre came "Lines for Elio
Schneeman," followed by a truly wonderful elegy for Hannah Weiner entitled
"Hannah Where" - "You are coded in between all the lines... I love you
because you are the one who says I see, I see, I see..."

Following, Anne read from new work: "Marriage: A Sentence" - a funny,
bittersweet chronology of two marriages and a third common law arrangement -
 "When you are married chances are there will be food in the house when you
come in the door."
Next, sections from _Iovis 2 & 3_:  the first a continuation of her critique
on the American obsession with guns, then a powerful blast on the turf
battle over the idea of "women's epic" - featuring a very pointed, very
right-on letter from a former list subscriber (no names, please!) and
co-starring Charles Olson and Robt. Creeley.

Anne closed her set in a duet with Steven Taylor on harmonium - lines from
Allen's "Mind Breaths" - "no plot, no plot, embrace the stars you are made
of..."

The remainder of the evening was then remanded to the trusty custody of
Anselm Hollo. Who is acquainted with the night, the blight, the cross-hair
sight and a species of chimpanzees whose conflict resolution technique
eschews war in favor of group orgies. Began AH: "not to belabor lugubrium,
but..." and then read three poems by the late James Laughlin. He then read
from his own recent  _Hills Like Purple Pachyderms_ and _AHOE: And How On
Earth_.  Following are brief snatches: "benign evening come down... this is
not the sea, just a big puddle of hopeless desire for a new brain."  "So
listen to some Locatelli adrift in history's drunken boat." "How many years
does it take to shut up, to learn to shut up? Down the toliet with insight
stew." (Pound: "tempus loquendi, tempus tacendi").  "wintry note floats in
reason's mind shaft..." And for Ted Berrigan a poem, presented here in its
entirety: "The Other is the Same." And from a poem for  Allen Ginsberg -
"don't shelve that book yet, I want to remember him a little longer."
Underneath the bright, bristling wit, the marvelous, impish wordplay, the
impeccable sense of rhythm, the sharp pitch and stress of diction, me
thought I detected a darker note in Hollo's work than had been heard
previously.  Or was it only the sound of twilight drawing its ravenous wing
over all of us?

Chatterton, who Bob Hershon used to call one of his marvellous boys,
began in gladness to read LANGUAGE poetry while in the bath, then for his
first assignment in Bob's class handed in one of Bernstein's poems.  Bob,
stunned by the archaic calligraphy, passed Chatterton's ms onto Sun and
Moon, which _did not recognize the original voice_!  How this amused
Chatterton, who nevertheless ended in despondency and madness.

There kept being a crow noise from the speaker.  Sometimes Sit down in your

listen to these and other noises as the West Oahu CaneFires become super
victorious over the Hilo Stars at Hans L'Orange Park in Waipahu.

Getting tickets was easy from the District Manager where I work because he
has season tickets.  Four grandstands that cost $6 each were free for me.
 Also, I can Option games at Rainbow Stadium to see the Mud Sharks, or on
Maui to see the Stingrays or even the big island to see the stars.  This
reminds me that I like listening to the am news station KHNR when I hear the
big island report from Glenn.  Each day he does one and only one story & it's
about crime and it involves drug taking and women getting beat up.  KHRN,
Hilo is how he ends his report.

If you look around, there are a pleasing number of distractions hung on the

Hannemann, Waikele Club, Napa, Charley's Care Care Center, New City Nissan,

How did these get here?  O let me see if I'm replicating.

I don't notice the best sign which is for Wahiawa General Hospital in left

dong into the hole, they get $10,000.  I know what a puka is because when I
hooked up my computer in the branch, the District Manager said you need a new
puka for your patch cable.  The District Manager's son is hapa.  The District
Manager's favorite lunch meal is a big bbq pork sandwich at Big Kahuna's near
the airport.  They make their own bread and pizza.

It is true that you don't have to hit in the puka to get money.  For example,
cheerleaders come around with a hat and ask for money to give to the guy who
just hit a homerun.  Mufi Hannemann sponsors these lovely ladies, The Sugar
Canes.  They do dances between innings and help stage the prize giving events
also.  Mufi is on the city council and his picture is on the program.  He is
smiling in an aloha shirt and next to his smile it says Aloha to a Winning
Team!

Susan is embarrassed about asking for the autograph of the CaneFires' Manager
Tom Lawless.  I think he used to be a utility infielder for the Cardinals.
 Susan says so any time a player comes up who is affiliated with the
Cardinals.  Both she and Bryant are wearing Cardinals hats.  Hers is home.
 His away.

On the drive to the game Bryant says the NavSat attenuates during wartime so
certain informed users can fire weapons with very accurate foci.  During
peace time, the attenuation is dithered so that airplanes and ships can
listen to the satellites for positioning, but not firing weapons.  This
relates to the antenna which has just been pulled down to speed the opening
of the new H-3 freeway.  The antenna looked like many high tension wires
strung across the big gorge near Kaneohe.  A network of these sounders
broadcasted very low frequency beeps to ships.  They were called the Omega
Stations because they were the end all to large broadcasters.  You can see a
sign in North Dakota that says US Coast Guard Omega Station.  Another funny
thing is that the Omega wavelengths are about 15 miles.  I have trouble
imagining waves that big, even on the north shore, which is near Bryant's
house and he is a science teacher and is always reading some book at poetry
readings like the CMOS cook book.

Juliana is grading papers, I'm watching for foul balls, Susan has her mitt
(lefty), Bryant is sucking on crack seed & Charles is mixing $1.75 mai tais
for Australians on Pub Craaaawl at the Reef Towers pool bar in Wacky Kitty
and never sees any of this so then this is for him.  One foul ball hits the
stadium lights behind home plate and I want the lights to shatter like in the
Natural, but no, the ball just falls back to the field.  During its fall the
umpire gets a new ball out of his pouch and begins to throw it to the
pitcher; but he stops mid-motion because the foul ball has bounced off his
leg.  A bat boy kid picks up the foul ball as the umpire completes his throw
to the pitcher.

The Phili Phanatic is here tonite, but in his non-denominational form which
is called Sport.  Sport shakes his belly in a hip jerky sex motion and goes
ha ha ha.  Sport comes up and rubs the non hair on my bolohead thank you
Susan.  Sport is pleased stroking the short spines and makes an ah ah ah
noise.  I imagine Rodney Dangerfield is below the surface.

In the middle of the sixth inning, Sport puts on a pink dress & feather boa
and approaches the home plate ump.  A song plays like I can't take my eyes
off you, you're to good to be true, etc.  Sport seduces the ump and they slow
dance.  Sport wraps the pink feather boa around the ump's neck and trails it
down between his legs.  Sport pulls the feather boa slowly from behind in
order to stimulate the ump.  Some young girls say when he go do dis, ya and
ya, he funny, ya.

CaneFire man is here too.  I am frightened by CaneFire man.  He has a yellow
fire head and big white eyes and a white mouth.  Yet the eyes don't work and
he never speaks.  He lives on the hat and is in fact the logo of the team
where he swings a burning bat and is smiling and has devilish eyebrows.  He
represents the spirit of the Cane Fire, which starts in the middle and slowly
creeps outward.  Rats scurry across the road, trying to get away.  Egrets
swoop down to eat worms.  The cane crackles like metal in a microwave.  The
flames are anxious to burn the cane.  Flames jump from stalk to stalk, hiding
behind the smoke and burning the stalks to a crisp.  The ashes rustle in the
wind and land like soft feathers.

The field was developed by the Oahu Sugar Company and improved through the
efforts of plantation manager, Mr. Hans L'Orange.  He recognized Waipahu as a
baseball town and he supported 24 ball teams at the plantation to keep the
workers and the community entertained.  Mr. L'Orange had a vision for Waipahu
and its people, whom he sincerely cared for.  He also had a vision for the
ballpark which coincided with his business philosophy that Oahu Sugar Company
had good sugar because Oahu Sugar Company had happy people.

As we leave the game, the CaneFires undress in the dug out.  Juliana is
bummed she has not noticed the Asian players doing this, but does see the
umpires changing in the parking lot.

The field is now empty and black, with only flickering flames, popping up
here and there, playing hide and seek.  Trucks lumber like elephants,
carrying loads of black cane from the wide, black, deserted fields.

The cane trucks rumble into the sugar mill and unload black stalks onto the
conveyor belt.  Molasses barrels are piled up like blocks.  Thick smoke rises
out of the stacks.  The faded green buildings drowse as the smell of sweet
sugar drifts through the air and lingers in the town and another day at the
Oahu Sugar Company has come to an end.

In Andrew Levy and Bob Harrison's dazzling inaugural volume of CRAYON, a
census of the great ideas people have when Jackson Mac Low is in the
vicinity, Dan Farrell, formerly of Vancouver and now residing in poet-thick
Brooklyn, excerpts his "(Untitled Epic Poem on the History of
Industrialization by R. Buckminster Fuller) GRID."  Each stanza is gridded
out of the words on a page of the 1962 Simon and Schuster edition of
Fuller's poem.

Grid #27, shorter than most, goes like this:

uneuphonious paralysis
rosy hands omnipotence
lowering big feet blue
me acromegaly much do

The work, like its topic still in progress, is on-line at
http://www.erols.com/dfar/index.html.  Dan voiced a batch in Providence two
Saturdays ago in an informal set with Peter Culley, whose lovely, smart,
and sometimes startlingly Olsonic THE CLIMAX FOREST (Vancouver: Leech,
1995; available from SPD) is a book I greatly admire.

Crayon, complete with a soundtrack, goes for $20 at booksellers or via SPD
(ISSN 103-4677).

Thank you, Pat Pritchett, for one more of your always eminently readable
reports on a poetry evening. Anselm's AHOE is a lovely book, which I
continue to read around in, & it was good to see it being named out here on
the List.

I'm glad you didnt title yr post "Schelling/Waldman/Hollo." Whenever I see
a List-post thats just a proper name these weeks I shrink up with fear that
the person being named, has died. I had to pause & wonder at "Buckminster
Fuller" earlier today....

Anyhow, perhaps the plethora of these reports has something to do with the
darkening of Anselm's palette. As long as he continues to emit, though,
time can reverse itself.

jeez, everyone seems to be having so much fun and writing so entertainingly
about it, while i sit in 15 degree weather sweating over this dumb
conference paper.  it makes me feel much better, actually to read these
marvelous doings in far places like boulder and hawai'i.  plus, i had a
skylight put into my bedroom ceiling; having officially joined the ranks of
the bourgeoisie (also having started in oct to have $ deducted from my
paycheck toward retirement); this is our version of fun in the frozen heart
land. life's looking up (at a sometimes-blue sky thru a glass hole in my
roof!)

Frankly, rather than buzwords of the moment, I rather know what Opus is
thinking...or Dilbert.  The only sense I get of the world from newpapers
happens in the comics.  Gee, I miss Pogo...the most poetic cartoon.

While I agree democracy is based on trust...I can't agree about
representative democracy.  That comes about because whoever draws up the
rules doesn't trust the rule of the mob and finds a "nice" way of
developing a leadership faction.  And, then, those with money buy off the
representatives...that's the way it works in Congress, the Presidency,
right down to city hall and the water district.

Onliest baseball game I ever saw on Oahu was between U. Hawaii and Arizona
State. Neat. This was at Aloha Stadium, I think, at Pearl. Artificial turf.
And multipurpose. That is, they rolled some bleacher seats in to be the
outfield barrier. Neatest thing was not that the Rainbow Warriors won, but
that in the stands instead of hotdogs, all the old Japanese guys were
eating miso soup.

Phew! I have just been reading it for 45 years, and have been labouring at
writing poetry for a decade less than that, and so far I havent made myself
educated enough to know that Pound is that poor. I still think he's a great
poet, and that most of the time. I guess I just havent worked at it hard
enough.

I've lived in two New England towns that were small enough that everyone
knew everyone. They were governed by town meeting--direct democracy,
Yankee-style. As far as I could tell, these towns were governed with a
degree of corruption that would make a Bostonian blush. This being America,
almost no one attended the meetings except those who had inherited a
monopoly on town offices. An example:
The town tree warden in Williamsburgh, Mass., also ran a tree-removal
company. For every tree he condemned he earned a fee, and he assigned the
execution to his own profit. His brother was the road commissioner.
I lived on South Street, then and now a quiet place that saw traffic
primarily when the school bus picked the kids up in the morning and
deposited them in the afternoon. It had one vicious curve that an
occasional drunk took the hard way when it was covered with ice during the
seven months of winter, to much crunching of metal and little bodily harm.
The road commissioner saw a good thing here. Under Mass law roads above a
certain width automatically become the responsibility of the state. In
theory widening the road could save the town a little of the plowing costs
it sustained every winter. It would also remove half of the front lawns of
the houses along the road, and, coincidentally, a lot of trees. Using that
vicious curve  and the school buses as an excuse, and holding out the
prospect of relief from plowing costs, the widening proposal was pushed
through a packed crowd of maybe 20 close friends and relatives. The
following morning, before anyone else could find out what had happened at
the meeting, the tree warden was on South Street with his crew. By 10 AM a
row of oak trees that had run in a straight line for a couple of hundred
yards along the road for two hundred years had been reduced to firewood.
But the warden had miscalculated. The trees had bordered Nels
Christiansen's farm, and Nels was married to Cathy Merritt, whose family
had been on South Street, a half-mile of which they owned, for longer than
the oaks. They got a special town meeting called and organized a couple of
hundred people to attend.  The road did get widened, but more carefully, up
to the border with the next town, where it retains its original width,
meaning that there has been no effect on traffic or safety. The bad curve
is still there, and so are the tree warden and his family, and no one
without something to gain goes to the town meetings.
Maybe the idea of representative democracy was that if you paid someone to
attend a meeting he might actually get there.

George, I hadnt realized that "but also often dissolves in nothingness"
meant that Pound was a poor poet. Isnt that what all the finest poetry
does? (I took the "in" to mean "into". But perhaps the writer means, "drop
it in a pot of nothingness, and it dissolves", a remark that may have
something to do with the esthetics of reception.) Btw, did you get those
moose antlers off your head yet? We've been missing you at the poker game.

That still leaves the question, how would "the mob", i.e., everybody,
take care of garbage collection each week?
I believe in giving trust a chance and
reining in the money interests.  You cynics give up too easily.
Popular sovereignty AND the rule of law would seem to require elected
representatives to devote full time to interpreting the law.
Though many of our congresspeople seem to devote full time to fundraising
and partisanship. That's because most of us have left out the
sovereignty clause.  We're apolitical and then we blame the politicians
for taking advantage of us.  Our enemies never seem to live up to our
own versions of utopia, for some reason.  - Henry Gould

All this talk about Baseball in Hawaii makes me feel even stupider for
sitting through a Chicago Bears game on Sunday in minus-five windchill.
        That game, too, had poetic implications. Besides constantly
reminding me of Lorine Neidecker's quote ("these are the folk from whom
all poetry flows. and dreadfully much else" {pardon the lack of
lineation}),  it also reminded me that more people read interesting books
than I tend to assume: when during one of the hundreds of TV timeouts I
showed my friend the used book I bought the day before (David McFadden's
_Gypsy Guitar_),  and which I was reading to and from the game on the
el, the guy sitting next to him said, "hey, he write travel books?"
        Turns out his wife works in a bookstore, and she brought home the
recently released collection of McFadden's "trip" books, and he read the
_Trip Around Lake Huron_, and I learned for the first time that these
three books had been brought out as one: from a guy wearing a Bears Jersey
who put away enough beer to pickle an ox. Almost worth freezing to death
while watching a boring game.

Wow, no! And my goof, it wasn't public school, it was Bob's students at
the private St. Ann's School in Brooklyn who created Lawrence Stazer
(Teachers & Writers Magazine, V15#3). Chatterton should be listed in yr
desk reference or cd rom -- here's how they encapsulate him in the concise
Columbia:

1752-70, English Poet. At age 12 he was composing the "Rowley poems" and
claiming they were copies of 15th-cent. manuscripts. He came to London,
failed to get his work published, and killed himself at 17. An original
genius as well as an adept imitator, he used 15th-cent. language but a
modern approach. He was a hero to the Romantics.

Henry,

I'm no cynic about the path of representative democracy and have not
given up.  I do think its the best way to govern, but history is on the
side of the money powers buying what they think is best for them and hang
the rest of us.  Then all the corruption and power games get thrown in
and you have the continual messes we find ourselves in most of the time.
Nay, not a cynic, but a student, as well as practioner, of government and
electoral politics  with an insider view to its workings.

Jerry.

Dear Mr. Davis,
   Unaccustomed as I am to this epistolary format, nevertheless I will
endeavor to respond to your query.  In brief, Sr. Enrique Chepasa de
Shivamitimbres-Goulashada, known to certain contemporary "email"
networks variously as "Henry Gould", "Jack Spandrift", Eric Blarnes",
and "Torquemada", remains an elusive historical personage in the
history of late 17th-cent. Iberian pseudo-poetics.  Born in Granada
(according to local legend, beneath a flowering Burpee seed catalog),
Sr. Enrique served in the Spanish Armada under the pseudonym of
Fernando Bombastador, Capitain of the Galleon Reye Leetle-Brune-Jug,
which foundered tragicomically off the northeast coast of Scotland
in 1588.  To summarize, Sr. Enrique lived out the rest of his days
chained to a barrel of McDougall's ale; from there, he wrote the
masterful version of Cervantes' famous "Don Quijote" which so inspired
JL Borges' inimitable "Don Rickles en Madrid" pastiche, with which I have
no doubt you have undoubtedly certain familiarities, I am convinced.
(Pardon my english.)  The writings attributed to his other pseudonyms,
mentioned above, are apocryphal and of doubtful provenance; however,
Luigi Della Patata of Bologna in a recent monograph has compared
chirography of the various ms. with signal success.  For further
information I encourage you to consult Della Patata's website:
http://www.consyrup.com; and thank you for all your enquiries to
which I regret my inability to respond individually, as I am 16
different persons, and you can imagine the practical difficulties
which might result from such and etc.

Yours multiply,
Rudolph Rougenez

Thanks Maria & David. Yes, I suspect David you correctly attribute one of
the causes for the alleged recent endarkenment in Hollo's poems. Dark they
may be, but I find them bracing and peculiarly comforting, perhaps from
acknowledgement of common plight, i.e. mortality. And unlike Pound, thank
god, no retreat into tempus anything but straight on until nightfall, damn
"the insight stew."

Subject:      grief to come/*tragedy* et al
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Although I did express grief over Kathy Acker on UB Poetics, and even though
I did not use the word *tragedy* in expressing my grief, I do find Kathy's
present
condition intolerably sad. I am not part of your literary community; I am not
an academic; I had been trying refrain from speaking publicly about the
recent loss
of Kathy and others. Those who know Kathy well must be aware of the strong
and conflicting emotions she can evoke. The strength of those emotions took me
by surprise when I posted here. I underestimated the intensity of those
emotions.

If I'm reading them correctly, certain correspondents on this list are more
interested
in challenging grief than in acknowledging it.  If so, remember: I did not
post a discussion
of scholarship or historical accuracy. Truthfully, I should not even have
mentioned Kathy,
since her health ought to have remained my private concern. Nor do I wish
to go into detail
about Kathy's condition. To challenge the assessments of others would mean
to divulge
more of what I ought to have kept to myself.

My reason for posting here was simple. People were discussing Laughlin's death
while I was trying not to think about Kathy. Nevertheless, as the
discussion continued,
I kept thinking of her. I also thought of Lou Stathis, David Wojnarowicz,
Susan Walsh
and Liz Brockland, all of whom died or disappeared without my being able to do
anything about it. When I could not go on thinking about their passing, I
posted blindly.

To David and Maria:

While it is terrible to read of someone's death, it is worse still to feel
death's
immanence without being able to intervene. It is worse to watch impotently
as death descends. Your words do not correspond to my understanding of
death, nor have I endorsed your words; therefore I need not be true to your
words. I need to be true to the memory of those for whom I grieve.

I did not know your child prodigy. I have not stood at the epicenter of any
of the disasters you cite. Yes, these events are tragic. But while one can
lament them in the abstract, such events do not awaken pain.

What I want is not to win some argument over terms like grief and tragedy
and loss. What I want is for Kathy to remain alive. What I want is for Lou,
Lizzie, Susan, David and others to resurface. It is unfair that we should live
and they should not. I wish they were alive and that is all I wish.

In the past, I have cared about rhetoric as ardently as I cared about people.
But now that I'm losing people, it is harder to care about rhetoric.

If you did not mean to attack me over an honest expression of grief,
then please accept my apologies for misunderstanding your reply.

However, if you did wish to quibble with me over texts, then please choose
a textual reference in any other post I have ever made. Please don't take me
to task over this one. Grief is bad enough. An autopsy would be torture.

All the best to you. May you be reconciled to this subject in a more adult
fashion than I have managed so far. I wish you no ill. I do not wish to fight.

All best always,

Rob Hardin

shared by many, I have no doubt. And No, Rob, it wasnt you who used
'tragedy". My chief concern was that Listpersons were posting in as if
Kathy Acker's death were a foregone conclusion & this struck me as
callously insensitive. What would it cost you-all to have at least as much
patience as she needs to muster? David

        Anyone who heard Clinton's address will remember his quoting of
Whitman.  Next day, William B.'s "silent revolution,"  Eileen Myles' '92
campaign of "total disclosure," and wondering about poetics as gesture(s)
of activism.  A representitive democracy would seem to simulate how we
ultimately "trust" our authors.  Who wrote Mr. Clinton's address?  Myles,
in a '94 interview, "I was simply being a writer, a poet, in public.  And
there was no other way to do that other than to say you're a presidential
candidate."  C. Bernstein, "Ideology . . . everywhere informs poetry and
imparts to it . . . a density of materialized social being expressed
through the music of a work as well as its multifoliate references."  By
insinuating that gays and lesbians and bisexuals as well as himself are
equally entitled to the rights of their citizenship, ie. consomate
representation, was bittersweet at best.  That societal values own up to
this notion has yet to be seen.  How incredibly calculated Mr. President's
unprecedented appearance, and it is a group of faithful voters he's after.
I "trust" he will earn some.  A poem, as a cultural product, seems an
abject token in this context.  The question I have for the list is this:
to what extent are our poetries/poetics an effective cultural analogue?
Is the gap of representation (assuming a lot here, I realize) really any
wider now than it may have been in the past, may be in the future?

This came to me over the web, ultimate source unknown. I pass it along as a
possible source of poems for those so inclined.




One of the fringe benefits of being an English or History teacher is
receiving the occasional jewel of a student blooper in an essay. I have
pasted together the following "history" of the world from certifiably
genuine student bloopers collected by teachers throughout the United
States, from eighth grade through college level. Read carefully, and you
will learn alot.

The inhabitants of Egypt were called mummies. They lived in the Sarah
Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the sarah is such that
the inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of the dessert are
cultivated by irritation. The Egyptians built the Pyramids in the shape of
a huge triangular cube. The Pyramids are a range of mountains between
France and Spain.

The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the
Bible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of
their children, Cain, asked "Am I my brother's son?" God asked Abraham to
sacrifice Issac on Mount Montezuma. Jacob, son of Issac, stole his
brother's birthmark. Jacob was a patriarch who brought up his twelve sons
to be patriarchs, but they did not take to it. One of Jacob's sons, Joseph,
gave refuse to the Israelites.

Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw. Moses led
them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread
made without any ingredients. Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to
get the ten commandments. David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the
liar. He
faught with the Philatelists, a race of people who lived in Biblical times.
Solomon, one of David's sons, had 500 wives and 500 porcupines.

Without the Greeks, we wouldn't have history. The greeks invented 3
kinds of columns---corinthian, Doric and ironic. They also had myths. A
myth is a female moth.
One myth says that the mother of Achilles dipped him in the River Stynx
until he became intolerable. Achilles appears in "The Illiad", by Homer.
Hoomer also wrote the "Oddity", in which Penelope was the last hardship
that Ulysses endured on his journey. Actually, Homer was not written by
Homer but by another man of that name.
Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people
advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.

In the Olympic Games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits, and
threw the java. The reward to the victor was a coral wreath. The
government of Athen was democratic because the people took the law into
their own hands. There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so
high that they couldn't climb over to see what their neighbours were doing.
When they faught the Parisians, the greeks were outnumbered because the
Parisians had more men.

Eventually the Ramons conquered the Greeks. History called people Romans
because they never stayed in one place very long. At Roman banquets, the
guests wore garlic in their hair. Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the
battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March killed him because they thought
he was going to be made king. Nero was a cruel tyrany who would torture his
poor subjects by playing the fiddle to them.

Then came the Middle Ages. King Alfred conquered the Dames, King Arthur
lived in the Age of Shivery, King Harlod mustarded his troops before the
battle of hastings, Joan of Arc was cannonized by George Bernard Shaw, and
the victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. Finally the Magna
Carta
provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the same offense.

In Midevil times most of the people wee alliterate. The greatest writer
of the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verse and also wrote
literature. Another tale tells of William Tell, who shot an arrow through
an apple while standing on his son's head.

The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value of
their human being. Martin Luther was nailed to the church door at
Wittenberg for selling papal indulgences. He died a horrible death, being
excommunicated by a bull.
It was the painter Donatello's interest in the female nude that made him
the father of the Renaissance. It was an age of great inventions and
discoveries. Gutenberg invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh is a
historical figure because he invented cigarettes.
Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Francis
circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.

The government of England was a limited mockery. Henry VIII found
walking difficult because he had an abbess on his knee. Queen Elizabeth
was the "Virgin Queen." As a queen she was a success. When Elizabeth
exposed herself before her troops, they all shouted "hurrah." Then her navy
went out and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.

The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespear. Shakespear
never made much money and is famous only because of his plays. he lived in
Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies and errors. In
one of
Shakespear's famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation by relieving
himself in a long soliloquy. In another, lady Macbeth tries to convince
Macbeth to kill the king by attacking his manhood. Romeo and Juliet are an
example of a heroic couplet. Writing at the same time as Shakespear was
Miquel Cervantes. He wrote "Donkey hote." The next great author was John
Milton. Milton wrote "Paradise Lost." Then his wife dies and he wrote
"Paradise regained."

During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a great
navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His
ships were called the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Fe. Later the pilgrims
crossed the ocean, and that was called the Pilgrim's Progress. When they
landed at Plymouth Rock, they were greeted by indians, who came down the
hill rolling their was hoops before them. The indian squabs carried
porposies on their back. Many of the indian heroes were killed, along with
their cabooses, which proved very fatal for them. The winter of 1620 was a
hard one for the settlers. Many people died and many babies were born.
Captain John Smith was responsible for all this.

One of the causes of the revolutionary Wars was the English put tacks in
their tea. Also, the colonists would send their parcels through the post
without stamps. During the war, Red Coates and Paul Revere was throwing
balls over stone walls. The dogs were barking and the peacocks crowing.
Finally, the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis.

Delegates from the original thirteen states formed the Contented Congress.
Thomas Jefferson, a virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the
Declaration Of Independence. Franklin had gone to Bostin carrying all his
clothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm. He invented
electricity by rubbing cats backwards and declared "a horse divided against
itself cannot stand." Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.

George Washington married Matha Curtis and in due time became the Father
of our country. Then the Constitution of the United States was adopted
to secure domestic hostility. Under the Constitution the people enjoyed the
right to keep bare arms.

Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother
died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his
own hands. When Lincoln was president, he wore only a tall silk hat. he
said "In onion there is strength." Abraham Lincoln wrote the Gettysberg
Address while traveling from Washington to Gettysberg on the back of an
envelope. He also signed the Emasculation Proclamation, and the Fourteenth
Amendment gave the ex-Negroes citizenship. But the clue clux clan would
torcher and lynch the ex-Negroes and other innocent victims. On the night
of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by
one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed assinator was John
Wilkes Booth, a sopposedly insane actor. This ruined Booth's career.

Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltare
invented electricity and also wrote a book called "Candy." Gravity was
invented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in the Autumn, when the
apples are falling off the trees.

Bach was the most famous composer in the world, and so was Handel. Handel
was half German, half Italian, and half English. He was very large. Bach
died from 1750 to the present. Beethoven wrote music even though he was
deaf. He was so
deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when
everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for
this.

France was in a very serious state. The French Revolution was accomplished
before it happened. The Marseillaise was the theme song of the French
Revolution, and it catapulted into Napoleon. During the Napoleonic Wars,
the crowned heads of Europe were trembling in their shoes. Then the Spanish
gorrilas came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon's flanks. Napoleon
became ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained. he
wanted an heir to inherit his power, but since Josephine was a baroness,
she couldn't bear him any children.

The sun never set on the British Empire because the british Empire is in
the east and the sun sets in the West. Queen Victoria was the longest
queen. She sat on a thorn for 63 years. Her reclining years and finally the
end of her life were exemplatory of a great personality. Her death was the
final event which ended her reign.

The ninteenth century was a time of many great inventions and thoughts.
The invention of the steam boat caused a network of rivers to spring up.
Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormic raper, which did the work of 100 men.
Samuel Morse invented a code for telepathy. Louis Pastuer discovered a cure
for
rabbis. Charles Darwin was a naturailist who wrote the "Organ of the
Species." Madman Curie discovered radium. And Karl Marx became one of the
Marx Brothers.

The First World war, caused by the assignation of Arch-Duck by a surf,
ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.

I would recommend Ross Talarico's _Spreading the Word: Poetry and the
Survival of Community_ (Duke, 1995). Talarico is a poet who was employed
for a decade or so by the city of Rochester (NY) as its artist in
residence, and he gave workshops to seniors, disadvantaged kids, etc. One
of his interesting points is that one way to bring people to reading
(literacy) is through writing, esp poetry. And there's some pretty
impressive poetry by some of the high school kids in there, much better
than that by those kids represented by Adrienne Rich in her edition
of the Best American poetry 1996.
        He also advances the notion of "deliteracy" as a way of explaining
the state of the word in the contemporary US (pointing out that we live in
a culture in which those who use language to deceive can get rich and gain
power, whereas those who use it to demystify and enlighten, are
marginalized.
        No news to anybody on this list, but personally, I never get tired
of hearing it.

Mark, I have only inflicted with my nails the meniscus of your astonished

only lash myself that these were not viable then in 1993 altereity-sage

I can understand your position, David. You cite good and sober reasons for
voicing
it, not the least of which is compassion. But if you've read Kathy's cancer
piece in the
English press, then perhaps you know that she, too, has been impatient with
her own
mortality; has treated it as a foregone conclusion. She has been more
dramatic about
her own death than the majority of us could manage at our most excessive.

Those who fear the worst are not callous for expressing that fear:

A callous person wishes the worst to be true. A friend fears the worst and
wishes
it were not. I would never have voiced my fear if I were not chafed and
abraded from
visits to the hospital that did zero good, from visits to the police
department, from
profitless searches for the others whom I've mentioned. What might seem like
callousness is really the desperation of a useless friend. That desperation is
personal and does not translate. "My" grief is a vain and frivolous subject
which,
I fear, is not worth anyone's attention. It posits but does not merit your
eloquent
response.

My mistake, D. and everyone else. I've said as much already and reiterate now.
I hope we can drop this thread and go about our business.

All the best to you,

Rob Hardin

-


The Language


Maybe they're walking. Maybe they're in Hakata-Eki. Maybe they're out
in the street. Maybe there's no street, no names, just first-last, who
got there. Maybe there's the getting.

The language is the same all the way down, Jennifer said. First you
notice the signs on the street, then labels on electrical cords,
things like that. You expect hiragana or katakana, fixed alphabets,
and instead you get infinity. Infinity leaks everywhere; kanji goes on
and on, back and back, flooding the world. The world is all that is
inscribed, she said.

They wonder how we reproduce. They keep track of us with electronics,
sometimes collars. We're nameless; they can't tell us apart. We fade
quickly in the sun; sometimes shadows give us away, but not often
enough. There's no borders around us. They think we don't reproduce.

Kon said, they don't reproduce; he knew it. They were fixed, like
stations. They had answers for everything; questions were a suffix.
They're present - they were always present. They'll be there. Europe
is a flower.

Somewhere there is a signal, and an eye meets it. What crosses and
reverses is chiasmus, thinking organ /\/ organic thought. There are
terms beyond alphabets and numbers, pronunciations that do not meet
the eye, then are no signals, but instances, instantiations. They cut
the paper in two; they made the paper, the edges of it rough, shorn as
if torn.

They'd write this in hopes of a better future life. Kon was doomed,
Jennifer distraught. Polaroid filtration, transparent apart, blocking
light and yama-mountain together. They'd have a better life.

Gaijin distraught. Gaijin at a loss. Gaijin on the run. Gaijin with
guns; no one else in the world has guns. They're long and black and
metal, flat blue metal and black grips and blue bullets and black
chambers. They have fetish-sheen, get high black-market, grey-market
prices for them.

Tom looked up; he's got one for sale. The customer: a Korean from
Pusan. Niman, worth every yen. Eyes the bullets. Calls Tom out to the
genkan. Look, man. Guy looks Tom in the eyes. Tom takes two of them,
down for the kill.

Koreans are killers. Gaijin make the guns, peace-makers. They fire
them in special kilns. Last several months, waterproof, always good
in Fukuoka autumn. Rains destroy wars. Gaijin never get wet; they've
got oils in their pale skins. Dollars go a long way translated into
any currency.

There's an investigation, Jennifer distraught. She calls on Kon. He
sees death for the first time. It's gaijin death; Kon understands.
Suddenly: Zen, satori! Knows all. Kon knows.

Jennifer and Kon go out to the Darkroom. It's black, blue, like bul-
lets. There's a ledge on one side. They sit. Korean walks into the
glare. He's looking, nervous, edgy. Could it be someone else; they
know all of them know all of them, Kon says. Jennifer says, Kon,
you're prejudiced, ignorant, unknowing-cloud, you haven't got it. Kon
says, Jennifer.

The Korean orders saki. Saki-man says none, besides no heat here, just
the sound. Hole blares from the speakers, pale-faced Alan requests
from the corner. They've got hats. Jennifer knows hatred first-hand,
sees it seething. The Korean turns slowly, as if there were something
on his mind. Kon says, impossible. Jennifer thinks, impolite.

Soon someone will reach for something and it will all begin. It's a
question of time, not Heidegger or Husserl, not being. It's waiting an
instant out, a moment. The Korean gets up to leave. Stop, says
Jennifer, hold on, just a moment. The sky turns blue-black.

Nani says the Korean. Gaijin bastard. You haven't a mother haven't a
father. You came from the clouds. Jennifer whips him across the face;
eyes flash out, sliced last-vision Jennifer down on the ground scream-
ing; she's scrammed. Kon: Don't do that again. You've screwed the
deal.

Tom, Tom, Jennifer says, he's dead. The language is all the way down.


__________________


As for Jennifer, her personality is gentle. Jennifer-san rages late-
night Darkroom, but never again; Nakasha heats up, Tenjin, all the
outlying districts. See gaijin run; Kon gnaws death as for himself.

Kuchi ga gatai, he's closed-mouthed, hard-mouthed; he now watches Kon.
Jennifer-san awakens from a dream of killing, slicing; it's all right.
What was before is the same; Kon's transitive, she thinks. Kon thinks,
she's the one for me. They have tea.

Nothing happened at the Darkroom, Jennifer guesses. She's lost her
name, -san has disappeared. She wants Eigo all the way down, the
tongue of the native, transparent comfort pretending understanding.
All language is viral, poison (she read); it seeps in, obscures, makes
pretty-poison blue-black writing. This _is the case_ she decides,
here! now! She wants to have the description of the world delivered
daily to her front door, no genkan in the way, socks and boots already
facing inside-outside and everywhere.

She doesn't understand, Kon decries, decides. They have tea, toast,
what remains of yesterday's bento. They move on and early-morning out,
already rage against the city. What happened to Tom? What did he speak
with gun-barrel diplomacy, or rather kanji could he read just about
anywhere?

Kuchi ga karui, she'd have a light mouth, ask everyone, spread rumors,
listen everywhere, blabber on, prattle to friends and strangers, talk
and talk until _it_ returned with news, something in a pocket, a trail
leading backwards and forwards, shuttling through snack-bar town.
She'd open herself wide, ready for the fall. She thought Kon: I like
you. Deeper, I love you. Maybe deeper yet, I'm in love with you, or
maybe I'm crazy in love with you, madly in love. She thought Eigo Eng-
lish talk, Jennifer-san, may I speak to you after class? An English is
my owning language. Kon read his name on the bullet.

She read, in blue and black, "The evolution of machines is at first
evident by the fact that they arise in "generations." One after anoth-
er, newer models supersede the older, which often are embedded - let's
call this the distortions of history, somewhat backwards-compatible.
But sooner or later, there's a big leap to a new paradigm, and every-
one is left behind. Capital picks up the pieces: Buy New! And trans-
late the best you can; otherwise, there's nothing to do but start
over."

This Korean who killed Tom for the guns is a machine, she decided,
there's a new game in town. But it's only human species, said Kon,
well, by definition, not so much new under the sun. Certainly not in
the centuries of Fukuoka, everyone business as usual. The guns were
laid out in parallel rows, glittering, glint-glint! as jagged patterns
flashed before Jennifer's eyes, a migraine coming on.

She was gaijin, up to gai-jinx. She lived in a world of pure incompre-
hension, the lessons of school-children, difficult periods, medication
and saki-solace. Japanese would have been another language of smooth
vocalizations, repetitions. Syllabic-hangul Koreans closed in, taking
over yakuza-gaijin connects. Kon thought it was a matter of alphabets,
lean syllables, phonemics, running slipshod across low-bandwidth com-
puters, everything running high-speed forever, wires singing. In
cyberspace, everyone knew their place, a matter of romaji, latin let-
ters. In the future, Kon thought in black and blue, wars will be a
matter of position, citation degree-zero. But not now as pachinko
lights cast spells upon the population, gaijin and native alike. Not
to mention the schoolgirls sliding like eels into the depths of child-
hood, everyone wanting a piece.

Into the maelstrom of the Darkroom, Rumours, Snack-Bar Delight, Kon
and Jennifer plunge; naked beneath their shirts and pants, they clutch
each other, mouths open as if about to speak, recite alphabets and
guns. All the colors in the world, are all the colors in the world.
Now, she takes his gun in, Tom forgotten. Now, every-word-perfection
comes to bare on flesh, a new position for the body as concepts mount
one another, photograph the moment of arousal.

Begin language. Gesture.. Some chemical makes response to rhythm; ano-
ther makes visions. Flexible arms and legs. Skin-book, the first book
is the body. Jennifer's nipple pierced by Kon's ring of silver; Jen-
nifer-hiragana across Jon's breast. Numbered into one another. The
dog-eating Korean has the guns. Rumors: look for them, they're looking
for you. Machinic dispositions of reciprocity and exchange. Gears
coagulate out of the beginnings of material culture: Jennifer owns her
ring, Kon, his skin-marks.

Savage names lacerate mobile sites right from the beginning. _No one
understands the name,_ it's the hinge or vortex of incomprehension.
It's too close to the real. The Korean is "the Korean." Tom-dead is
clearly generic; Kon knew he reproduced like water, no-fuck flows and
empty-rhythm culture.

There's no name to truth as bodies wed to earth: "Kon and Jennifer are
marrying." "Kon and Jennifer are getting married," Jennifer teaches.
"But Jennifer is wedded to the earth." Kon, Khan, conquistador and the
dirt of central Asia. He should know. He should know her.

The language is the same all the way across. Across the strait, Pusan
beckons. Kon and Jennifer for the holiday, for the hell of it. They
knew: no truth here. Suddenly: blaze-guns in the streets. They go
down: something's coming!

It's the dog-eating Korean, following them, how? On the ferry, foot,
bicycle. With the new guns, he fires away. Perfect trajectories are
catenaries slightly out of shape, given the earth's tired sphere. A
star-pattern across Pusan's streets, they're running now. Jennifer
thinks Jennifer's fault, she's spread talk everywhere, loose lips,
kuchi ga karui, can't keep her mouth shut, can't keep a secret, asked
too many questions, talked everywhere and everywhere. Her words
flooded the streets of Fukuoka from Chiyo south to Okinawa. Everyone
knew, crazy gaijin with her signs of Eigo, placards of romaji, kanji
boards held taut with gaijin-Tom's improper name.

In Pusan, dust. Policeman Dick is riding by, beauty-bicycle, black and
blue. Policeman Dick's gun puffs, dog-eating Korean is blown away. Now
Kon and Jennifer quietly leave the park for the ferry; they've had
enough! Now they'll wed the water, work through all four elements. Kon
thinks, there's a time for everything; Jennifer knows better. Jennifer
knows she owns time, owns Kon's time, owns all the time in the world.
Jennifer-gaijin is always perfect Jennifer.

Kon and Jennifer reproduce together, and Kon learns the useless value
of collars, electronics, monitoring devices. He takes her silver ring
between his teeth, distends her breast slightly. She can read the
hiragana, Jennifer's true love.

Just wanted to quickly jump in and propose, I guess in Henry's defense,
that "rose-tinted glasses" can, when used as part of a web of
self-conscious symbolic action, have social and poltical teeth.  I'm
thinking particularly of Frederic Jameson's "proposition that the
effectively ideological is also, at the same time, necessarily utopian,"
in The Political Unconscious.  Jameson attempts "to project an imperative
to thought in which the ideological would be grapsed as somehow at one
with the Utopian."  The utopian is useful as symbolic action because it
awakens both disenchantment and desire, two necessary components of
political and social action.  Now of course, Jameson's Utopia is a Marxist
one.  But who's to say we might not hijack the theory to posit "Democracy"
as a narrative which is "socially symbolic action," as Jameson insists all
narratives are?  The cynic says, "democracy's no good b/c it doesn't
work."  The skeptic says, "the times, the materials are out of synch with
democracy.  Democracy as symbolic action is what Burke called 'deferred
action,'" and maybe this awakens the desire for social change.  What good
is the writer who merely tells us "things is bad."  Hell, we already know
that.   -m.

The best of this kind of thing (in film) that I've heard yet! Some of the
Italian film subtitles are interesting as well (like In Fellini's _Satyricon_
and elsewhere). There is a dramatic quality about them: along with the humor
there is a liveliness or energy in them that is hard to match. The lines are
short and impulsive/implosive, the language of farce. In some of these, I hear
Charles Boer (one of Olson's students) in his translation of Ovid's
 Metamorphoses where the economy of language and oftentime absence of the
pronoun lend to it absurdly.

And through readings. I just finished this morning reading poetry to a group of
elementary school children (K through 5). Read to them from Roethke's _Praise
to the End!_, _Words to the wind_, and _I am! Says the Lamb_. It was exciting
to see how much poetry appeared to still have a place in their lives, and how
their teachers gave poetry writing assignments.

Readings that address how aesthetic concerns intersect with literacy
issues?  Did I hear that as it was intended?  Intersect?  Interpenetrate?

I'm tempted to suggest that one look at "literature" to see aesthetic
concerns intersecting with literacy............

        "defferred action" sounds like a what-good-is-a-writer telling us

Far from it.  I am a writer so I could harly be a what-good-is-a-writer.
In Burke's sense, "deferred action" is the dialectical counterpart to
"things is not perfect," hence its utopian character - it shows
symbolically what could be and sets itself in dialogue with what is (or
isn't).  Though, do you really think things could be *perfect*?  I think
we'd all have to be dead for that.  -m.

Two places I know of that deal in OP poetry books:

VERSEtility Books, Bob Jacobs,
Box 1366   Burlington CT 06013
860-675-9338

Whitehead Rare Books, Jett Whitehead,
1412 Center Ave. Bay City MI 48708
517-892-0719

They both catalog mostly first edition, & often signed,
copies. so the books, if they've got em, will come at
a dear price.

        No No No  --  Not what I was saying at all.  I'm just skeptical of
a dialectical process whose extremes are absolutes, ie. "perfect"  --
Although I'm not as familiar with Burke's system as perhaps I should be,
the dynamic vaguely resembles typical, western, macho blunders through the
ages.

Yes! Along these lines, a lot of those Kenneth Koch and Ron Padgett books
from the Teachers and Writers Collaborative (did I get the name right?)
might be helpful. They're not theoretical enough to please many graduate
school types (of which I'm one), but they do make points about the place
of the aesthetic in education.

This summer I taught some 6-8 graders. Their favorite: Wallace Stevens'
"13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird." At least in terms of generating
imitations and parodies.

I've been lurking every so often in the archives this semester and
lurked yesterday to find Jordan Davis's post, "Yasusada, Watten,
social texas." In it, he says that "Kent Johnson seems to
have taken a vacation from the Yasusada updates."

Well, you can hardly expect me to not respond to that! Hi Jordan. And
by the way, you still owe me $20 from last summer.

But anyway, I'd like to second Jordan's remarks about the
Financial Times article ("Mind Food: On the Art of Writing
Wrongs"--on the FT web site) because it's pretty interesting, but to
say also that its views about heteronymous authorship are pretty
restricted. Check out, for example, the views of the Granta editor,
or the concluding analogy, if that's the word, of the article's
writer, Christian Tyler: that literature should always carry a
"warning" or "origin of production" label (however small, he
qualifies), like the food you buy in a supermarket! (And I don't
think he's being tongue in cheek.) Also of related interest just out
in UK is a section devoted to Yasusada discussion in the new issue of
Poetry Review, including letters from Stand editor Jon Silkin, an
inteview with me by Peter Forbes (PR editor) and an exchange of
letters between myself and Akitoshi Nagahata (part of a by now larger
correspondence about issues relating to Yasusada that we intend to
publish somewhere--Mikhail Epstein and Eliot Weinberger also enter
this debate). Akitoshi Nagahata is on this list, and his criticisms
of Yasusada are far and away the most thoughtful and
thought-provoking I have encountered so far.

But the main update I'm back from vacation to post is that _Doubled
Flowering: From the Notebooks of Araki Yasusada_, is just out from
Roof Books, quite beautiful in production and available for $14.95. I
believe James Sherry will be putting a more complete notice on the
list shortly. The book is 170 pages, including a 45 page "critical
appendix."

I know many of you have been assuming that the book is by me.
Well, here it is. "Who it's by," if that's important, is present
there. But you can read it, too, without playing detective. Hope
you'll give it a look!

Harryette Mullen and giovanni singleton read Monday evening, November 24,
at 7:30 PM at Loyola Marymount University.  The reading will be in the
McIntosh Center of Sullivan Hall.

For those of you flying in for the reading, Loyola Marymount is
conveniently located near the Los Angeles airport.  For those of you
driving to the reading from the local area -- take Manchester towards the
ocean.  Before driving into the ocean, turn onto Loyola Boulevard.  This
street will take you directly into the campus.  Before turning into the
large visitors' parking lot at the entrance, stop and ask the helpful staff
in the security booth to show you where Sullivan Hall is located.

Sounds like Kent Johnson would like all of us to read the Yasusada
book even if it isn't by Yasusada. Splendid attitude.

Now the question is Why not use your own name?
Again, the specter of Orientalism underlies your self-deploying fanfare.

Your lackadaisical nonchalance regarding the falsification of A-Bomb
survivor literature is tantamount to forging Jewish Holocaust literature
just to make a buck at Borders (a similar point was made to me by John
Treat recently).

I would like to discuss this issue further, but you must refrain from personal

attacks (how am I "self-congratulating"?) and speak to the contents of my
insinuations (in this long-established discourse).
The issue is the forging of the book not the quality -- which, as has been
established from the pieces in print, is less than satisfactory: predictable
attempts at entrepreneurial Orientalism, riddled with affective clichés and
revealing a shallow understanding of Japanese life (to be expected of an
American ignorant of Japan); devaluation of the lives of actual Japanese who
experience the effects of the A-bombs still today.

A couple years ago in Japan a major magazine ran an article on the fact that
the Jewish Holocaust never happened. Should this be ignored too? (The magazine
folded soon after, to take responsibility for the outrage.)

Last week a judicial nominee withdrew his name after admitting to have
falsified stories of tragic racial violence against a member of his family in
the 1940s or 50s. He took responsibility for using historical tragedy for
personal gains.

Similarly I think informed readers should know what they're buying and boycott
the Johnson book if they don't want to contribute to the distortion and
consecration of historical tragedies (note that racism figures in all these
example of the Jewish Holocaust, the decision to drop the A-bomb twice on
Japan, and the murder of African Americans in the pre-civil rights US).

I can't imagine anyone seriously reading the Yasusada book except as a case
study in an ethics course, or a literary theory class discussing the limits of
postmodernism (I hope no one actually does this, wouldn't want to fuel his
projects).

Perfection, utopia.  Responding to M. Magee's posts, Herbert Schneidau
in SACRED DISCONTENT (often quoting Jameson) talks about the utopian
impulse as part of a general ambivalence toward culture per se which
has its roots in Hebraic-Biblical nomad tradition, fiercely antithetical
to the established Egyptian or Near Eastern empires surrounding it,
and eventually turning the criticism (in a truly unprecedented way)
on itself.  This character of self-alienation can terminate in nihilism,
or overthrow for the sake of overthrow, but Schneidau characterizes
the western impulse as truly ambivalent - a love-hate relation with
culture which is perhaps the key factor in culture's long-term survival.

What if utopia is truly an inward reality, yet based on the character of a
person's relations with family, friend, enemy, neighbor?  What if "the
kingdom of heaven is within you"?  Then the demand for an "outer" utopia
tends to extremism.  Perhaps to be zealous for those siblings, democracy
and law, is enough.  To struggle for a truly international law based
on human equality might be the real flower of an inward utopia - an
inward utopia based on the recognition of terrible IMperfection.
Not self-righteousness. The hardest law to live up to is to love
your neighbor as yourself.  & that's the basis of all the rest.
This will be judged to be the complacent pablum of a middle-class
mid-lifer.  Tell a poor person about the inward utopia, they will say.
But you'd be surprised what a number of poor persons would say in reply.
It's all just talk until it conquers the world.

Last night dreamt George Bowering lumbering down from Canada, terrifying
apparition with the head and torso of a black bear, hindquarters of an
Arctic fox, grey squirrel's tail, giant eagle's wings and a rack of deer
antlers on his head.  What can it mean?

Dean:

Strong feelings, to be sure. But just to clarify, in case you weren't
aware: the AY work has been known to be a fiction for a year and a
half now.

My own strong feeling is that the Yasusada writings spark issues that
are a good deal less settled and more ambiguous than your
formulations below would allow. There is a long interview in the
book, actually, that attempts--if tentatively--to bring some of
these difficult questions forward.

I suppose I could only ask you to first read the book. It's at least
possible, I think, that you might soften your judgement after
considering the whole work.

Would you (or anyone else on list) happen to have John Treat's
e-mail? I admire _Writing Ground Zero_ a great deal, and would like
to exchange some ideas with him.

Kent

I think that the actual real A-bomb devalued the lives of its victims a
hell of a lot more than any poem ever could.

You've been living in the world of discourse for too long. No one denies
that these events are catastrophic and evil. What I object too, and called
"self-congratulatory," was the assumption that you are the lone crusader,
on this list, for justice.=20
=09And I object to criticizing books you haven't read. Even if you
know they're evil. Some time back when I worked as a free lance
journalist I wrote about the Turner Diaries, assuming before I read it
that it would be vile and disgusting based on what I'd heard. But before I
wrote about it, for the now defunct Minneapolis _City Pages_, I read the
book. Guess what? I read it, wrote more intelligently about it than I
would have otherwise, and still to this day have not lynched a single
person of color or feminist.
=09I also object to the assumption that it is impossible for someone
to write in a persona, to IMAGINE what it might be like to be a survivor
of the Atomic bomb.  In the Yasusada poems I've read, it seems like the
poet does an adequate job. I could be wrong. You could even demonstrate to
me that I've read badly, that I'm wrong, but not if you haven't read the
poems yourself.

Who was your critical mentor, the Ayatollah Khomeini? For he too knew all
about certain books without having to read them.
=09The discourse of Orientalism is problem, and when it distorts the
lives and experiences of other people, it should be criticized.If the
Johnson book actually does that, go after it.  But you don't really know
if it does or not. Is this what you are learning in graduate school, how
to make authorative pronouncements about books you haven't read? I don't
think that's what your teachers really want.

Let the record show I have not met "Kent Johnson" and have no debt to him.
I mentioned the article simply because it was as close to a mention in a
major newspaper as recent American poetry has gotten in a good while
(forgive me, Bob Holman). If Andy Warhol was right and publicity is a good
in itself, then good for "Kent".

While I can't offer the intense discounts Yasusada-publisher James Sherry
used to dangle before this list, I can send Teachers & Writers' fall
catalogue out to anyone here who e-mails their mailing address to me. We
have several non-theoretical graduate-student-irritating titles by Kenneth
Koch, and a few point-making books edited by Ron Padgett (including
_Handbook of Poetic Forms_ -- ask Mark Baker! -- and _T&W Guide to Walt
Whitman_). Oh all right, here's a discount -- e-mail me today and I'll
send you Ron Padgett's _Creative Reading_ for $20 ppd, a 20% savings off
the usual deal (US & Canada US$20, elsewhere US$25).

Signed,
"Jordan"

So, Dean Brink can't imagine why I might want to read the book?  Wow, I

Perhaps you shouldn't give your imagination so much credit.  Just because
you can't imagine why somebody would read (or do) something doesn't mean
they don't have legitimate reasons for doing exactly that.  That aporia is

It seems we've started an interesting chian of misreadings, fruitful I
hope.  In any event, Burke's own dialectical process is anything but
absolutist.  And he's saved from extremes by his insistence that
philosophy, like poetry, is rhetorical - about strategies rather than
truths.  Essentially he's a pragmatist not unlike Wm James or Dewey, in
the sense that he believes that, as Dewey says, "Philosophy is not a form
of knowledge.  Philosophy is a form of desire, of effort at action."  Any
utopia which a writer posits then (and I'm thinking particularly of
utopias posited at the level of syntax in a Jackson MacLow and others, not
a story about "why can't we all get along") is good for what it *does* not
for what it *is*.  In regards to poetry, Burke describes it this way:

"The general approach to the poem might be called 'pragmatic' in this
sense:  It assumes that a poems structure is to be described most
accurately by thinking always of the poems function.  It assumes that the
poem is designed to 'do something' for the poet and his readers, and that
we can make the most relevant observations about its design by considering
the poem as the embodiment of this act."

So, looked at in this light - utopia as a rhetorical strategy, as socially
symbolic act and not absolute at all - that's what I'm getting at I guess.

-m.

jeez dave, there are enough *ideas* at stake here to make personal attack
unnecessary.  even kent himself in his response was not so virulent.  i
tend to agree w/ dean, tho i'd probly express myself in milder terms.  and
why assume that people who raise the issue of social justice and the
ethical problems with appropriation are dupes of something you call
"discourse?"

A spur of the moment and awkward attempt at light-heartedness on my
part, and I apologize to Jordan. I guess I was assuming everyone
would know that Jordan and I didn't know each other!

As far as the mention of American poetry in major newspapers, the
Asahi Shimbun, Japan's major newspaper, carried a front page story
about the Yasusada discussion in August (this was reprinted in a
number of newspapers in Japan, including in Hiroshima),
and this was followed up by an article by Akitoshi Nagahata a couple
weeks later in the Asahi. I mention this not because I think
publicity is "good for its own sake" (for what it's worth, I don't),
but because I think it is significant that a serious consideration of
Yasusada's aesthetic and ethical implications is emerging in Japan,
and it will be very interesting to see the positions taken and how
they compare to the strong and very different evaluations here.

"Kent" --

Sorry to have assumed that the Yasusadayada was in fact a publicity scheme!
I don't know where I could have gotten this idea! I regret that because I
am on a tight budget the Roof Book-to-be-published-next-year I am planning
on acquiring is not the Yasusada book but Brian Kim Stefans' _Free Space

discussions about controversial topics are always subject
to this pattern of escalation--which is why you can start
off arguing about who is to do the dishes, & end up being
called or calling someone "asshole" & the like. while I
agree with Maria here, that we might be able to have this
discussion without that sort of interference, I wld also like
to point out that escalation is something like a virus: it
comes from somewhere & it goes somewhere. in this case,
I think it's a little silly to jump on Dave Zauhar for an
inflammatory ad hominem post without acknowledging
that Dean's remarks about "self-deploying fanfare" &
"lackadaisical nonchalance" hardly meet the standard of
disinterested criticism he's bearing.

incidentally, I wonder if we can look a little more closely
at the frequently levelled accusation that (assuming for a
second that which is by no means a foregone conclusion)
Kent constructed this project to enrich himself either in
terms of monetary or cultural capital (I think the statement
in this case was "tantamount to forging Jewish Holocaust
literature just to make a buck at Borders"--not an outright
accusation, but the implication is there). now, before
folks start jumping on my head, let me say this isn't
quite a defense of the project--which *does* have very
serious ethical implications of which *all* of us are aware--
so much as it is a wish to drop excess baggage. does
anyone seriously believe that the AY author is going to
make his/her fortune from the sales of this book? that
it's going to get him or her a great job somewhere? from
what I've seen so far, Kent, as the most prominent
figure in the affair, isn't rolling in ill-gotten gains, be
they monetary or, again, cultural capital. in fact, except
for a few supporters & a few more temperate critics, he's
been absolutely reviled at every turn as an unredeemed
racist who tells the worst kind of lie--the one we believed.

now, I'd love to have this discussion again, but first can
we all go back to our corners & figure out what's really
at stake?

best, Chris

        Having been away from this list for some time due to work in
visual poetry, painting, etc.--this note may be somewhat late.
        In the discussion of the futurists, formalists and acmeists, an
important work to consider is The Futurists, the Formalists and the
Marxist Critique, edited and introduced by Chritospher Pike with
translations by Pike and Joe Andrews as well as prefaces, notes and
afterword provided by Gerard Conio and translated from the French by R.
Swyer.  London:  Ink Links, 1979.
        The influence of the formalists in the last quarter century on
many aspects of "language centered writing
" is well known, and the influence of the Acmeists, both in Russia and
the USA today, is also well known.  The work of the Futurists however has
been for the most part suppressed or distorted. Indeed, in an essay in the
Chuch Welch edited book Eternal Network, the Russian visual poet and mail
artist Rea Nikonovna notes that when she and her husband fellow visual
poet and mail artist published the Samizdat journal Transpolans in the
1970s, a Neo-Futurist journal, it was widely attacked by both the social
realists and the conservatives of the Acmeist schools.Personally and as a
writer and visual poet, I find that much more is to be learned from the
Russian Futurists, that there is much to consider in their work, their
manifestos, their visual poetry and artists books--and perhaps that is why
they are still largely ignored, because they offer ways of working and
thinking opposed to the more easily acceptable formalists and Acmeists.
        I would hope that with the slowly growing body of work in English
language concerning the Futurists more recognition and thought will be
given to them and their work. While attending a Visual Poetry conference
last summer in Edmonton, I found that to the poets from Russia and
Ukraine, the greatest poets of this century for them are the
Futurists Khlebnikov and
Kruchonyhk--not the Acmeists or the formalists.
        There are a number of excellent books now available on Russian
Futurism; one that is in part available on the web is Gerald Janecek's
Zaum The transrational poetry of Russian Futurism which is mainly
concerned with the work of Kruchonyhk.  Chapters from the book and some of
the work of Kruchonhyk may be found at Light and Dust

I have heard from others that the work of Kruchonyk, not widely known
in the US (to say the least) is very strong.  I can't argue with your
version of the respective treatment of Acmeists or Futurists in Russia,
Dave, but I'm skeptical of a simplified victimology ("futurists were
ignored or suppressed").  For one thing, the formalists were critics
& literary scholars, not a school of poetry - & they focused on the
futurists in their studies as well as on the "acmeist school" (it never
was a "school" - unless you're talking about people like A. Kushner,
an academic Mandelstam imitator of the present generation).  Secondly,
as I understand it, the interest of some of the language poets in russian
poetry had a LOT to do with the futurists, not just the theories of
the formalists.  Khlebnikov has had at least as much a vogue on that
score as the acmeists.

Mikhail Epstein has an interesting essay comparing end-of-century
russian "schools" with the big 3 at the beginning of century (symbolism
acmeism, futurism) in the THIRD WAVE anthology.  But it's also
sort of creatively forced & schematic.  Acmeism... it's sort of shorthand
for particular poets, like Gumilev, Mandelstam & Akhmatova.  But it
means what you make of it these days (the way Epstein did).
The fact is Mandelstam & Akhmatova left not only a body of poetry
but of theoretical writings & essays for scholars to chew over;
Khlebnikov did the same, but less traditional & more difficult to
analyze.  Maybe that's part of the "problem".  But is it a problem?
They were not airtight schools by any means.  Mandelstam held
Khlebnikov in high regard & some say elements of his style were
drawn from K. during the 20s. Pasternak, closely associated with
the futurists, has certainly gotten at least as much attention as
the "acmeists".  - Henry Gould

Canada Post is on strike which prevents me, for the time being, from
mailing issues to new subscribers. Please hold off on posting payment to
the Toronto address for now. There's good indication that the strike may be

If the strike drags on I will mail stuff out from Buffalo the next time I'm

Thank you Charles for relaying the sad news. I didn't know him personally, but
I have been reading him with much interest. David Ignatow was a poet of
uncommon, brutal honesty. A poet of the real but also a poet of alternate
reality, of very real possibilities (the 'what if,' or 'why not'). I have found
in his poetry a tough but hopeful dialogue with self; far from familiar, even
his physical self to him could be as other as deathly reflection in a mirror.
His journals reveal this lifelong struggle with his own identity and mortality.
They also point to him as poet/citizen having a considerable political
conscience. He too has been underestimated, always there prolifically writing
away in the background, but I don't think this will continue to be the case.

Poetas,

got the appended, and thought it might interest some here.  In
particular, although evidently the tabloid press (& maybe pulp
fiction?) is the probable major focus of the requested essays, seems
to me there may well be scope for discussion of that fave topic here
in Poetics land --

the Xerox-zine / Mimeo-zine
[or other variants of nonofficial publication] --

as note the inviter's remark:
<< . . . these essays should focus on the way in which cheap print in
general, or particular print forms, can not only represent but
transform culture. >>

She does also refer to << studying the format of cheap,
mass-distributed print>>

so while those myriad of mimeo / xerox poetry magazines all qualify
in terms of "cheap", whether they qualify in terms of
"mas-distributed" is another kettle of worms / can of fish.

I leave that to work out with your prospective editor . . .

d.i.

btw, I don't subscribe to the "calls for papers" mailing list, but
one supposes that some diehard essayists might find it of interest
(see end of post for particulars)

                CALL FOR CONTRIBUTORS:

      TABLOID HISTORY: CHEAP PRINT AND POPULAR CULTURE

I would like to invite you, to submit a portion of your work for a
volume of collected essays entitled, "Tabloid History: Cheap Print and
Popular Culture."

"Tabloid History" is designed as a collection of essays depicting the
ways in which studying the format of cheap, mass-distributed print
changes our understanding of cultural and literary history.  In
contrast to recent volumes which present periodicals through more
traditional forms of literary/publishing history, these essays should
focus on the way in which cheap print in general, or particular print
forms, can not only represent but transform culture.

All topics, geographical regions and time periods are welcome.
Interdisciplinary work is strongly encouraged.  Submissions will be
chosen on the basis of their interpretive and methodological
contributions.

My idea is that the essays will be as clear and brief as possible.
They should be useful both for scholars trying to think in new ways
with pthis material and for undergraduate classes looking to combine
primary fmaterials with a good secondary essay that will illuminate
the toriginal documents. I'm less interested in getting a bunch of
brand new pwork, per se, as much as distilling the best lessons from
the work that tpeople are already doing.

Because I would like to move along the pace of this project, I'd be
grateful if you could contact me immediately if you are at all
interested in contributing.  The deadline for abstracts is Jan. 15, so
I can get preliminary approval from the publisher.

Thank you very much for your time,

A couple years ago, he gave a lively reading at Beyond Baroque.  He was
wonderful, and a very pleasant person to boot.  Sorry to hear about his

Moazzam,

thanks for the excerpt from Manto's letter to Nehru -- this is the 1st
of read of this much-mentioned Manto, and he seems witty & likeable.

/ / / / /

Hope you'll pardon me if I pedantically quibble over one small point
of English.  Your point was quite good, and yet the illustration was
poss. inaccurate in one particular.  You wrote --

>. . .  When a word travels, it is vulnerable to

Did you really mean the *first* syllable -- i.e., PHOto-graphy?

There are many differences in stress between British pronunciation and
American.  Here are a few common examples (using capitalized syllables
to denote the syllable wherein occurs the stress):

American                        British
___________________________

garAGE                          GARage
LABoratory                   laBORatory
WEEKend                      weekEND

As a "native American speaker" (not to say an Amerindian), I can tell
you (with a sense of conviction) that photography, in the U.s., is
properly pronounced with stress on the 2nd (not 1st) syllable -- i.e.,

phoTOGraphy

In this, the word follows the same (2nd-syllable-stress) pattern as is
to be seen in similar (4-syllable) words (many of which are, likewise,
ideational nouns).  There are quite a number of examples.  Allow me to
present a concatenation of such:

biOGraphy / geOGraphy / porNOGraphy /
ePIphany / anTIthesis / philOLogy /

onTOLogy / onTOGeny / phyLOGeny /
onCOLogy / zoOLogy / asTROLogy /

exOGgenous / homOLogous / hoMOGinized /
biOGraphist / phoTOGraphist / anTHOLogized /

asTRONomy / lobBOTomy / eCONomy /
exCEEDingly / perNICiously / apPALlingly /

enTIrely / reDICulous / psyCHOLogy /
aPOLogy / cosMOLogy / anTHOLogy /

desPARingly / peDANtically / comMODious /
ofFICiously / deLICiously / melLODious /

apPARantly / enVItronment / suPERlative /
unCERtainty / enVIDeous / comPARative

sufFICiency / efFICiency / proDIGiously /
prePOSterous / hyPOTHesis / reLIGiously /

liTIGinous / phiLOsophy / reLIGionist /
acQUIsitive / deRIVitive / reVISionist /

acCOUtrement / reQUIRement / aMAZingly /
asTONishing / adMONishing / outRAGeously /

acCORDingly / afFORDable / supPOSedly /
adDORingly / aDORable / imPOSingly /

EmPEDocles / PyTHAGoras / HerODdotus /
TheuSIDdites [sp?] / EuRIPpides / phoTOGraphous [a neolgism]

and the like.

[the penultimate 5 words are, of course, Greek names -- but they
follow quite the same pattern (prosody), and I suspect that they may
well hint at the origin of this stress pattern in English]

/ / / / /

Now, I suppose it's poss. that Britishers may say PHOtography -- they
do get a lot of things mixed up like that!  ;-) -- but I did think
(till seeing your post) that they had *this* one right -- er, I mean,
the same as is heard in the American form, which latter is, as said,
-- (at least throughout my short lifespan it has been) --

phoTOGraphy

(believe it or not . .  )
'nuff said?

cordially yours,
d.i.

p.s.:  to wax aphoristic:

phoTOGraphy is to biOGraphy
as is word to thought . . . .

p.p.s.: I dearly hope this runaway tangent of a post [note stress in
tanGENtially] may hap to inspire some resident SAsian writer, &
thereby beLATedly justify my reCALcitrant [ditto] . . . [etc.] . . .

Thanks, David.
        Eons ago, in graduate school, I took a course in Japanese morphology
which explored, in a language I knew [& still know, sadly] little of,
the shifts of syntax specifying the differences between [in English,
say] PHOtograph, phoTOGraphy, and photoGRAPHic. Not a bit tangential to
my own sense of each word as at least a ratchet set. [All that so I
could read the transliterations in Blythe's four volume _Haiku_
properly!] Gotta dig the beat!

Shifts of syntax would be word order, e.g.
        Biru ga Michiko ni camera o yatta (Bill Michiko camera gave)
        vs
        Bill gave Michiko a camera.
Japanese syntax is Subject Object Verb
vs
English syntax which is Subject Verb Object

Shifts in syllabic stress are phonological.

The bulk of the words were indeed Greek in origin -- and if I remember my
Greek correctly, it is usual for four-syllable words in Greek to be
accented on the antepenult (one of my favorite words)

        This info might help someone--would have helped me. I've been
working on something with a deadline, bought a "Priority Mail" envelope &
stamps for it, got to the central P.O. about five minutes after it closed,
& so dropped the envelope into a big "Priority Mail" box outside. Fine.
Next day I'm away, come back late, get my mail, & there's the "Priority
Mail" envelope, address pasted over with a green tag saying that anything
over 1 pound MUST be presented to a retail clerk at a post office "because
of heightened security measures." Funny nobody mentioned that when I bought
the thing.  So I had to drive out through a bad snowstorm this morning to
re-send it, two days later, and asked for an explanation. Do they have
poem-sniffing dogs, or what exactly? And if they thought it was explosive,
why did they risk the life of my rural route carrier to give it back to me?
I mean, she's a very nice woman! Got a family! Explanation was that after
the last TWA exploded the FAA required anything that might go on a plane to
be personally received. Anything over one pound. So if you're gonna do it,
do it in 15 ounces. Personally, I don't believe it--I think they've got
poem-sniffing dogs. Have an iced-tea, Sylvester

As a hoax I'm interested in the Yasusada debate.
What does it mean that so many editors rushed
to discover/print/promote this work? But I won't be
one of the first to actually order the book. Sorry,
I'm just not interested in the poems. And I wonder
what the next project of our hoaxer might be:
How it would go over publishing the 'lost' poems
of a Holocaust victim? Or posing as a black Jazz
musician with a herion habit?

I was sure hoping all the Yasusada crap had stopped, to much time on it,
tired of hearing, if you want to discuss that crap go back door direct to
those interested.  No one has to buy the book, you can either do as Abbie
Hoffman and Jerry Rubin used to advocate, steal the damn thing, or do
what I do when interested, but not enough to buy something...sit in a
nice comfy chair at Barnes and Nobles or Borders, read to you hearts
delite...satisfy both curiosity and social conscience.  Meanwhile, the
book and all the talk is just wearing...get a life.

Blyth's Zen in English & world Literature is worth hunting down as well...
like Saintsbury maybe more energetically articulate (=enthusiastic?) than
sensible, but who said sensibility was all that important anyway.

Subject:      Hubble's influence

Hubble is kind of a figure that stands.  Getting mad at him doesn't help.
 Thru his red shifting, the big bag was able to roll (unlike a man).  He also
started the idea of measuring how far stuff was away.  How fast stuff was
moving away.   How basically nothing was moving toward (no blues).

a thing i have always found suspect in the red shift theorizing is that you
have to postulate a basic uniform thing from here to there.  and from here to
another there.  and from here to another there, etc.  and you build up all
these theres and say the universe is about this old and this big.  so the
question i like is what if one particular galaxy (these are typically the
things that are being measured) was really nearby, but for reasons of
non-uniformity of space (due say to huge gravity fluxors) it appeared
massively red shifted, and so the linear thing to say would be to say it was
the farthest thing away and was moving away from us x fast and is really
really old.  (quasars pose problems like this).

below are two entries in a dictionary of physics on the web.  they just
happened to be back to back.  and i haven't fooled with them tony.


uniformity principle (E.P. Hubble):

The principle that the laws of physics here and now are not different, at
least qualitatively, from the laws of physics in previous or future epochs of
time, or elsewhere in the Universe. This principle was scoffed at by the
ancients who believed that the laws that governed the Earth and those that
governed the heavens were completely divorced; now it is used routinely in
cosmology to describe the structure and evolution of the Universe.

universal age paradox:

Two of the most straightforward methods of calculating the age of the
Universe -- through redshift measurements, and through stellar evolution --
yield incompatible results. Recent (mid 1990s) measurements of the distances
of distant galaxies through the use of the Hubble Space Telescope indicate an
age much less than the ages of the oldest stars that we calculate through
stellar evolution theory. At present there is no conclusion to this paradox;
a cosmological constant would rectify the situation, but it's possible that
the discrepancy will disappear with more accurate measurements of the age of
the Universe using both methods.
.............

If you like physics, math, etc dictionaries, there's a good one by a guy
named eric (his treasure trove).

can anyone look up a good definition of quantum mechanical tunnelling and

Subject:      Re: David Ignatow (1914-1997)

I've been spending some time this past week thinking about my friend
David Ignatow.  When Charles sent out word about David's death, I
began thumbing through David's most recent book of poems, _I Have a
Name_, published by when David was 82.  A couple of poems:

As If

The prayerful humanity of Bach,
the soldier machinegunning--
I don't know how to reconcile
one with the other and to the living,
where with others I walk, stunned.

In a cafe music is pouring itself
in joy for itself for anyone to dream
of reconciliation with conflicted life.
Farther down the road an energetic man
is beating his wife.

How to live in confusion
and as a skeptic, angry
to have been born to music
and to screams intermingling,
as if--not one without the other--
to make a whole of it.

*

For Rose
               1913-1995

I have a name
a substitute
for the word
infinity.

When my name is called
it is not me
you are calling.

*

David's poetry and friendship meant a great deal to me.  He wrote a
very generous blurb for my first book, _Doublespace_.  He was an
energetic correspondent, and he continued to read, think, and argue.
Early on in our friendship, he steered me to George Oppen's poetry.
I have written about David's poetry, and I remain drawn to its odd
syntax, a kind of quirky yiddishness, an odd mixture of modesty and
passion.

yes, interest multiplies - but what if the red shift is actually a blue shift?
I mean, if you're not the only purple on the beach (i.e. within a coney
island radius). MillenniuM starts with M, ends with M, and has 2 Ns trying
to be a 3rd M in the middle.  what does this tell you about the donut shape
of spacetime?  I mean, what if the purple shift is right here, diaphanous,
in the bree E ze? & we can't even see it?  And the calcified driftwood (or
Xxzv...w*klphtok in Assyrian) is a leftover from LAST week's recycling?

First guess, Brent, is that Bill posted something intended for Subpoetics
to Poetics. Subpoetics is the allegorical version of Poetics. Second guess
is that Bill (have you seen Bill's poems? I'd send you off to SPD to order
_My Trip to New York City_ but I'm pretty sure they're out of it), who has
an avid interest in astronomy, has long thought about astrophysics and
poetry with the same part of his brain, and is proposing that there is
some connection between the difficulty of measuring the size of the
universe and the difficulty of understanding whether poetics is the
discussion of what happens in poems or is it just where any individual
stands (that is, their status) in poetry. Now we know from Mark Wallace
that there aren't really any individuals, and I know from talking to Bill
that when he's being allegorical he's also really just talking about the
things that excite him, it being his (and Ange Mlinko's and practically
any other poet worth talking about's) poetics to pay attention to what is
exciting. At this point I will direct you back to the Poetics Archives
where you may read Bill's translations of Sappho, his notes on power
wires, and miscellaneous found poetry regarding the global branding of
Tiger Woods, and birds (I think). Getting mad at him doesn't help.

All best,
Jordan

Subject matter?  Anything can be subject matter for a poem.  It's what you
do with it, as WCW would say.  Use the concepts.  A garden isn't just dirt
and some pretty green stuff. . .a question of the size of one's world isn't
just subject matter--it's a formal question in the most basic way.

If it were a question merely of subject matter, we'd be talking about
science fiction.  We're not. (are we?)

Dean,

I apologize for upsetting you further...now that you mention it, maybe a
science fiction poetics group or as was suggested by another, this is
poetry.  We may not be advanced enough to see it as such.  There IS a lot
out there parading around as poetry that is not.

Please take this in stride...we'll wade through the manure soon enough,
only to get stuck in another pile.

Jerry.

Well, if you write a haiku, for example, & it takes more than about a
heartbeat for it to register, you've got a little too much thought in
there, a brow-wrinkle driving the poem apart--a [dead than]redshift. On
the other hand, if your haiku stays within the "pulsation of an artery,"
as Blake puts it, you've got a Rinzai-whack--a [black &]blueshift.
Cf. fission vs. fusion, or, chiasmically [& perhaps cosmetically vs.
cosmically], fashion vs. frisson. Everything, rightly conceived, has to
do with poetics [cf. Bachelard's _The Poetics of Space_, Pound's
economics, that (who wrote that?) poem based on the Fibonacci sequence].

well, I guess I was thinking of Brad Pitt; pardon moi.

Wasn't Defoe a longtime member of that astonishing multimedia troupe

I think "aesthetics" and literacy can be thought together, broadly
speaking, through the notion of "the difficult," through "difficulty,"
modernist terms that can be resuscitated without their high-cultural
presumptive address, and located, rather, in a reading body scanning
social registers, some legible, others not (for differing reasons).

Hank,

Thanks for your post on Ignatow.

I read him closely throughout the 1960s, far more sporadically after that. I
was intrigued to see that he had suggested Oppen to you. I've always read both
him and Harvey Shapiro (the former NYTBR editor) as two poets who showed the
Williams influence very clearly, but in a way that demonstrated what growing
up as a poet during the period when the Objectivists were silent and out of
print would lead to -- decidedly on the far side of the New American poetry
and generally antithetical to everything that has spun out from that.

Subject:      acmeism / futurism

I thought the following passage from a new study of a forerunner of both
the Russian Acmeists and Futurists was quite interesting - linking futurist
practice to the decadents of the late 19th century and early 20th in the
approach to the word-as-such as self-enclosed or "quaint" object.  In the same
monograph, the author links the "classicism" of the acmeists not so much
to the ancients, but to 19th-cent. french poetry again via Innokentii
Annenskii. The book is "At the Crossroads of Russian Modernism: Studies
in Innokentij Anneskij's poetics", by Anna Ljunggren; Stockholm Studies in
Russian Literature.  These issues of influence have some (maybe tangential)
reference to contemporary "experimental" approaches.

"Like a trail of fluorescent particles, terms enable us to follow the history
 of a style in its trajectory from the decadents to the futurists. It is well
known that the acmeists considered Annenskij their teacher, and like him they
turned to the French poetic tradition of both the Parnassians and "les
maudits".  Closer examination also reveals the continuity between the decadents
 and the futurists.  Essentially, the French fin-de-siecle legacy is divided
between acmeists and futurists, and one can find echoes between their
paradigms which derive from their common ancestry.  The exoticism discussed
above, for example, is also present in futurist works such as Xlebnikov's
_Zangesi_ and acmeist poetry such as Gumilev's "Ziraf"(The Giraffe).
Mandelstam's recollected "blessed" word was brought to life by French
Byzantianism and is no more connected with genuine Greek antiquity than are
Xlebnikov's verbal incantations.  The recollected "blessed senseless word"
has an analogue in the archaisms of futurist _zaum_.  Valuable in this
respect is R.D. Timencik's analysis of Gumilev's poem "On the Distant
Star Venus", which points to the parallels between the language consisting
of vowels spoken by the inhabitants of Venus and the transrational vowels
in the poetry of Xlebnikov and Kruchenyk.  It remains only to add that this
analogy can be explained as having evolved from a common root, namely the
exotic synaesthesia of French symbolist poetry.  At the center of attention in
both systems is the relationship of the word to the thing.  Both are based
on the category of the "object" word and various interpretations of
objectness.  If the acmeists retain a focus on the linguistic nature of the
word and cultivate object meanings, the futurists consistently and radically
deny the difference between the word as sign and the word as meaning (cf. the
street signs in futuristic work; see also Kruchenyk's manual on how to make
futuristic poetry - _Displaceology of Russian Verse_).  The identification
of word and object gives rise to a manipulation of the word which is related
to the decadents' neologizing.  In other words, the futurist understanding
of the word as artifact derives from the decadents' cult of the artificial
and of the quaint object.  These analogies reveal the historical paradox
of Russian futurism - namely that the movement is a direct continuation -
more consistent and radical than acmeism - of the very stratum of culture
that the futurists furiously attacked.  Because in the French tradition
continuity is greater and the transitions smoother, the various forms of
symbolism from the decadent Huysmans to the "imagist" Laforgue coexist
within a single aesthetic tendency.  Hypnotised by the alleged absolute
novelty of the avant-garde, researchers have not brought up the question
of the systemic links between these two related branches of Russian post-
symbolism.  In part this is due to the fact that our philological and
theoretical notions of futurism have in many respects been shaped by the
formalists, in particular Roman Jakobson, who as a friend and co-author
of the futurists remained enclosed in the magic circle of the Russian
avant-garde."


Word and object.  Aesthetic experiment comes into focus via communication
theory - language as gesture and/or blocking or eliding of meaning.  Sound
and noise.  Message and code.  Both meaning and not-meaning as tools
of expression.  All this relates to the approach to "artifice" of several
branches of the "New American poetry".  In fact what Ljunggren identifies
as French symbolist-decadent tradition - filtered in 2 directions through
the seminal poetry of the Petersburg school principal I. Annenskii -
could be seen as fractally exploded-imploded and taken to its "limit"
by U.S. post-Olson experimentalism.

Subject:      Friends of Kathy Acker
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As some of you may have heard, Kathy Acker is in crisis.  She is in a
hospital in Tijuana with cancer of the lung, liver and spleen.  She is very
weak and her only hope is the combined holistic and allopathic treatment she
is receiving at American Biologics' clinic.  But this help is costly and her
financial resources are on the verge of running out.  She has no medical
insurance.  Like many artists and writers, she was never able to secure
benefits from any institution.

Kathy Acker was diagnosed with breast cancer in April 1996.  Shortly
thereafter she had a full mastectomy and there was some involvement in her
lymph nodes.  After the surgery she underwent extensive alternative therapies
in San Francisco, then moved to London to be with friends in August '96.
 (This period is described in "The Gift of Disease")  Over the summer of 1997
she suffered increasingly bad health, ranging from digestive disorders to
pneumonia.  Once back in  San Francisco in the fall, her condition worsened
and she finally was taken to the emergency room by Sharon Grace and Matias
Viegener.  At Davies Medical Center, she was told she had advanced cancer of
the liver, pancreas, spleen, and lungs.

In the hospital, she was given few options but morphine and hospice care;
Kathy chose to persue alternative treatment.  On November 1, she was taken to
American Biologics, a holistic integrated health clinic in Tijuana, Mexico.
Thanks to treatment she is getting there, and her strong will, her condition
is stable. However, she is running out of money.   $28,000 of her savings of
approximately $40,000 have already been spent in hospitalization in Mexico,
and the bills from 8 days in Davies Medical Center in SF are already past
$30,000 (these we hope to defer indefinitely; Medicare is still pending for
at least part of them).  The financial crisis is looming.

We have made arrangements with the John Giorno Fund for Artists with AIDS to
be the receiver of any contributions (which would make them tax-deductible,
and 100% of the donations will go to Kathy's bills).  The address is Giorno
Poetry Systems, 222 Bowery NY NY 10012; the check itself may be made out to
JOHN GIORNO and on the memo line write "Kathy Acker Fund."

Kathy has a solid core of people caring for her and is happy with American
Biologics' hospital, where Matias Viegener, Amy Scholder, Sylvere Lotringer,
Ira Silverberg, and David Antin among others have been with her.  As phone
calls tend to exhaust her now, she asks that people who are concerned write
her c/o American Biologics, Chula Vista, CA 91911 (this is the American
office of the clinic).

Anything you can do would be appreciated.  Please forward this email to
anyone you believe can help.

        I was looking at some Ignatow poems this morning from an old
anthology, _The Voice That Is Great Within Us_ (discussed previously on
the list). He was one of those figures that I devoured while in graduate
school (this would have been in the 70s) -- a voice that I trusted
implicitly, in the wake of so much that was false, pretentious, merely
aesthetic. The simplicity and tough-mindedness appealed to me, yet a
sure concern for craft (as Henry notes in another post this AM) was also
apparent; his journals were a great read as well. But the connection to
Oppen (surprising to me as well) gets to what I was thinking: here's a
writer who could conceivably bridge the gap between competing "schools"
-- someone whose work can be respected by people working all sides of
the street -- so immediately to label him as "antithetical" to the New
American Poetry (and we all know how problematic THAT appellation is to
Ron, and others) seems to me unseemly. Enough with the opposing camps
for a while -- let's appreciate the man and what he wrote, and did.

Since there was a lot of discussion about a year ago or so about whether
this film was available on video (it doesn't seem to be), I imagine that
some folks will be interested to know that it's scheduled to be screened in
a new 35mm print 20-26 February at the Grand Illusion here in Seattle.

While this run starts the day after that month's Subtext reading, so you
out of towners COULD make a weekend trip of it (& we'd all love to see you
here), it's probably more to the point that it'll be showing up at obscure
rep houses & series this winter.

Literacy has a price, too.

It is a trade off: you trade off the benefits and detriments of oral
culture for the benefits and detriments of a written one.

Values can be assigned to this transaction. It is, however, still a
transformation.

In Toronto a few years back I saw a man walking the street in front of City

slight frame and full of chapbooks, and a cardboard sign hung around his
neck with butcher cord, reading, in bright neon: USED DOG URINE: THE SECOND
GREAT ANTHOLOGY OF BAD CANADIAN POETRY. What I found intriguing was that
this grandstanding was most successful: he was continually approached by
people and was actually selling the stuff.

Is there a Used Dog Urine URL? Shouldn't there be?

That was Krad Kolodny (spelling?). Some of his books are available through
more usual channels. He is a self-proclaimed bad poet who made his living
for many years selling 'bad' poetry on Yonge Street for a buck a pop.
Interesting sort. Don't know of an URL though...

You can see right away that he is a bad poet--*needless* ambiguity. All for
want of one hyphen. Natch, one wants to know whether he considers his
poetry the outpourings of an as-it-were used dog, or the used outpourings
of a so-to-speak dog. My thanks to Harold Rhenisch for drawing our
attention to this matter of "bad poetry", and to Carolyn Guertin for
identifying this particular perpetrator. George Bowering and Doug Barbour
have fresh support in keeping Canadian culture alive on the Internet. I
welcome Rhenisch's pithy comments.(Thought I'd say that before Henry did).
But that's not just a joke, his comments are very pithy.

Bad poetry has its history, and notable among Kolodny's precursors is
William McGonagle (sp?), whose works are so very bad that they are always
in print. In that way they back on to A.E.Housman's _A Shropshire Lad_ .
But it may not be until our own day that a poet has set out to be
*deliberately* bad. I allude to Douglas Powell, who for a while ran on a
platform of "bad" poetry (or wherever the quotes should go) and even
published a manifesto about it.(I will post this brief essay to the List
upon request). He no longer presents himself as its advocate, however, and
has fled that scene to pace the heavens overhead with his upcoming book
from Wesleyan, _Tea_ . And very good it is, too--but then, I always thought
his "bad" poetry was good.

In fact, upon inspiration from Doug,  I used to order the rest of my
students to write bad poems,too, not just to feel that I was in control of
the class, but to challenge them to consider esthetic value in the bluntest
terms. By discussing whether Debbie's poem was worse than Scott's, we were
freer than in our disputes as to whether there were any saving graces at
all about Myfawnwy's or Cuthbert's. I even wrote some bad poems myself, as
some of you will know.

In Berkeley & SF in the 60s we had a street poet who took unto himself an
Indian or Spanish name--it was just one word, which escapes my recall--but
who was really Douglas Palmer. He would stand on street corners and write
you a poem upon request. Some of those must have been quite bad, don't you
think? But the Bubble-Lady of Berkeley, Julia Vinograd, is a street poet
who writes poems that are really quite fine, looked at from the perspective
of the appropriate poetics. Her autobiography, btw, in a recent volume from
Gale Research is outstanding.

Then there can be bad poetry in the sense that the Bad Lord Byron was bad,
I suppose; like the Bad Charles Bukowski (although some readers think his
poetry is bad in all senses). The word "bad" is beginning to take on the
complete meaninglessness of any over-used word, & I will put an end to this
right now. David

David,

I hate to think it so, but I met one woman, I think she lived in England, who set up a
booth during holiday shopping periods and wrote poems for people who wanted
"personalized" poems to send someone.  She made good money, especially during Valentine's
and Xmas.  It wasn't a full time activity, but paid better than many good poets ever make
off their work.

She offered to teach me her technique.  While the possibility of intresting research into
why and what type of poems would sell, I declined.  I've heard of others who do the same
in card shops and at mall booths.  Maybe better marketing would help...didn't hurt Rod
McCluen.

ODE TO THANKSGIVING

The Pilgrims came sick and weak, exhausted from the ride
they landed in a foriegn land already occupied
The people of the land came forth and shared of all they had
they made the Pilgrims well again so everyone was glad

Thanksgiving I was always taught was about that selfless sharing
from the Indians to the Pilgrims as a sacred way of caring
But I grew up and learned of truths otherwise left blind
of how the white man stole the land and got the treaties signed

How Indians were shoved aside and trampled in the wake
of thousands more white people who desired land to take
their deep traditions and beliefs considered to be odd
these people of the forest who had always walked with God.

I  learned the truth from knowing them apart from lies and books
and  discovered Indian blood in my viens and in my looks
I cherish them who showed the stranger hospitality and love
they hold a cherished place in this ones heart,signed Spiritdove.

THE BAD ODE TO THANKSGIVING

I have a dyslexic friend who is also a writer, in fact he won a major
literary award a couple or three years back (and does not want his dyslexia
widely known, so will remain anonymous).  He feels very strongly that
literacy has a serious price, and that price is alienation from the
phenomenal world.

Hugh Kenner was recently on CBC radio, saying that the Shakespeare of the
sonnets might have been a literary hack, writing the sonnets to the order
of lovers of various kinds, for pay. Kenner based this on Pound's comment
that he had done the same for the guards at St. Elizabeth's, who wanted
poems to send to their sweethearts. I wonder if any of those have survived?

I did a quick web search for bad poetry. Dull. Awful poetry. Duller. I did
what I should have done in the first place: used dog urine. Well, well,
well. I found a site called "Don't rub his nose in it". I think it is a
new, alternative poetics web-site in disguise. From there:

"The most important part of housetraining goes on not in your house but in
your mind."
"The biggest mistakes made in housetraining are made by the owners, not the
puppy. These mistakes can mean the difference between a reliable,
well-trained canine companion and a dog who has to be watched and
restricted for the rest of his life."
"New dog owners often don't understand how dogs think. The new owner
believes that his puppy thinks the same way he does - and has the same
ability to understand tough concepts such as cause and effect or evidence.
This is simply not true."

I also found a site called "Fooling the Bladder Cops". This thing is a
massive found poem, of book-length yet. I doubled up over the keyboard in
laughter. Yet another poetics site in disguise. No, not the keyboard: the
bladder guys. One sample:

"I heard from Dr. Grow that dog urine (of all things) can be substituted,
and will pass the test! ... This subsection assumes you have a clean
dog....It would make more sense to use human urine, but dog urine provides
a workable substitution in an emergency."

and remember, if you fail:

"If you're an adult, contact ACLU. If you're a child, don't bother; ACLU
won't do anything for children who fail the drug test."

>From the Red Shift to the ACLU, poetics does indeed infiltrate all levels
of society.

Buy Nothing Day 1997 is on Friday, November 28th

(remember: it always falls on the first shopping
day after US Thanksgiving, traditionally the
busiest shopping day of the year, and a starter's
pistol in the run-up to the Christmas shopping
frenzy). This year, why not take part? Rise above
the commodified, advertiser-engineered,

fooling the bladder cops (for Harold  Rhenisch)

this butler lends an air of sophistication
to that public siphon. illuminate the press.
many diagnoses of our postmodern condition
hinge upon debates about the relative stress-

patterns of crowd shopping. (it's all an act).
some adults wonder @ the workings of Our Father.
don't rub his nose in it: if you're an adult, contact
the ACLU locally; if you're a child, don't bother.

Judy,

On what basis does your dyslexic friend see alienation from the
phenomenal world as the price of literacy? Does he make that claim only
for himself &/or other dyslexics, or for everyone, or only for
non-dyslecics? Does he see that cost as permanent, or as operative only
when slamdunking such moolah into tollbooths on the turnpike of actual
reading/writing practice? Would he make a similar claim about orality,
which has its own not-necessarily-natural orders? How does he compose?

Subject:      one more entry for the Turkey Award
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Congratulations, Henry on a real turkey of a poem, really really bad. You
should get the prize. But the poster with the whidby e-ddress is pretty
bad, too, once we dissociate the lofty sentiments from the execrable form,
which was surely that person's intent, in calling their poem "bad".-- Since
nothing else is going on on the List (has everyone gone elsewhere for
Thanksgiving?--Joel, are you there? if so, b-c me!) I take the liberty to
post my entry in the turkey-poem sweepstakes. It ensues forthwith :


A Thanksgiving Poem That Would Be Bad If It Only Could

I am a stranger in your land
You are the Indians just for now
and I am you in a likewise temporary manner
Explaining your odd & divers customs
Pouring forthright explanations into my sly European ear. . .
I quote Ed Van Aelstyn, then Editor of the _Northwest Review_
When I was Poetry Editor
And Ed wanted to run in the same issue (this was in 1963)
(1) a photo-essay by Roger Prentice clearly favorable to Castro's Cuba
(2) McClure's translation of Artaud's
"To Have Done With the Judgement of God"
and (3) a Whalen poem in which he says "I must stop masturbating so often"
And I said "Ed, not all 3 in one issue, self-abuse, treason, blasphemy,
You're going to kill the bird
that has been laying such golden eggs" and Ed says
"Enough of you, & of Richard Sassoon (a fellow-editor of Euro-U.S.
background) with your sly European ways"
I reckon that "bird" was a "turkey"
after the university admin were thru with us
They made it into an organ of little future interest
Just the way it had been before Van took over
When he was just a grad student at U of O
which he was when we first met (1962)
It was a student writers' conference at Eugene
George Bowering and I drove down from Vancouver to attend
We got drunk on Gallo Port (the same wine winos drink)
And at the party chez Van Aelstyn we played charades
(All of us, not just George & me)
And next morning back at our motel
(Which was an old-style motel, i.e., cabins)
GB came into my cabin where I was laying on my bed of pain
thinking about the filling that has just come out of my tooth
Due I decided to drinking Gallo Port & resolving not to do so again
(And I never have) and he said "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"
To which naturally I responded "Why, what did I do?", because
In those days I didn't have complete recall of what had happened
after I got drunk at parties) and predictably he responded
"Why, don't you remember?" to which I of course replied
"Would I be asking if I did, you Prince?!" [except I didn't say "Prince"]
And George said "You don't remember playing charades?"
And I said, "Yeah, sortof, why?" And he said
"We were acting out book titles" and I said "Uh-huh"
And he said, grinning that goofy grin of his,
"And yours was 'The Naked and the Dead'"
But I had suddenly lost interest
Because being highly distractable I had focussed on George's pjs
Which were boldly striped and cut short on the arms
So the thin arms of the poet stuck out from the pjs
Reminding me of a deckchair in a high wind
On the way back George drove all the way very fast
Because he wanted to be with his girlfriend of the moment
And also because he thought he was "On the Road" Bowering
But the rest of us in the car well we weren't so sure
Ed made me Poetry Editor I guess he liked my charade {btw, none of this
Had happened at Thanksgiving, this was in the spring}
He would send me the submissions in Berkeley where I had moved to
And I would lose them among my stacks of students' papers
And the notes for grad essays & seminar papers & some poems
Ed would get mad at me then I'd find most of them
Most of them were really bad poems
But then I got the word out around Frisco & Beserkeley
So poets like McClure (not McCluen, aka McKuen(or McCluhan??)
and Whalen sent their stuff and then all came about as I have already told
which resulted in the loss of my modest stipend
and Ed being fired but then that was all for the good
Because he got a job at SF State
and he was a linguist and he taught linguistics to Ron Silliman
so that was how Language Poetry began now that wasn't too bad was it?
And Van and Jim Koller and Will Wroth I _think_ started up _Coyote's Journal_
Which was sort of a journal of Projective Verse/ Snyderean ecoconsciousness
It had an honorable table of contents not too dusty either huh?
So when they wheel that sucker in on Thursday
(lets hope thoroughly cooked so all the guests dont get sick and/or die)
And while grandma is crossing herself & saying grace
remember the Canadian grace "Good drink, Good meat, Good God, Let's eat"
& remember the phrase "The naked and the dead"
Think of people on this day who don't have any clothes to wear
or don't have any life to move them from place to place
To lift a fork to their mouths and chew
For some of us it will be our last Thanksgiving although we don't know that
at        the time not usually and being slightly hysterical I don't want
to experience
that sense of pervasive unreality I experience when I think of my own chemise
I expect I shall do as I have done for many years now
Imitate the natives, eat too much, cultivate turkey torpor
(which is an 'improvement' on a phrase of Richard Brautigan's,
after he had cooked us an italian meal, "5 minutes now to spaghetti torpor")
And since it would be unsocial to go to my study & write
Watch 3 football games instead now I am beginning to grasp american football
How it reveals the American genius for organization as Watten wrote recently
Think of past Thanksgivings when lively persons of the poetic persuasion
Graced my dinner table (not cooked & stuffed, I mean they sat there)
(But not as in "they just sat there"--they might jump up to recite
or to get another bottle or to tidy their dirty dishes away
While I just sat there in poetic torpor) and so to bed eventually
at such a loss for words our last words were likely Happy Thanksgiving!

Wild Honey Press is delighted to announce the publication of _Citation
Suite_ by Robert Archambeau.  It's a beautiful book which takes quotations
from Virginia Woolf, Plato, E.M. Forster, Naipaul, Richard Rorty, Shelley,
William Morris and Nathaniel Tarn and weaves them with other material in a
meditation on culture and legibility.  For a book written with such a light
touch it has a remarkable way of coming back into mind.  Insights,
witticisms, lovely phrases.

I'm not sure how to put this but it acts on the boundary between the well
innovative and the mainstream in very interesting ways.  Yes it is
consciously constructed, works with constraints, undermines the monogrammed
metaphor.  But there is a joyfully lyrical presence, not so much in the
diction or anything obviously nail-downable, but in the movement from
feeling to idea. =20

Available from Wild Honey Books, 16a Ballyman Rd., Bray, Co. Wicklow,=
 Ireland,=20
e-mail Suantrai@iol.ie as above. =20

Price =A33.50 (U.K. & Ireland) or $5 (bills, no checks) or in exchange for a
poem or indeed any piece of writing in any form.

Best to all,

Randolph Healy.

Harold--

What CBC program was this on and when is that show?  In some parts of
Seattle here one can catch the CBC radio bleedover signal from Victoria,
BC. (FCC-free radio is a blessed thing.)  Anyhow, would quite like to know
more about it.  Many thanks.

Not poetry, but fun: check out the international Herald Tribune (iht.com)

Dear sir we appreciate very much your poem however we take issue with your
discreption of american football as having to do with american managerial
practice when it is an allegory of territorialism and (as c.b. says
intellectual property is also theft) have a nice meal and remain calm.

Judy Roitman's dyslexic friend makes an interesting point about
literacy's price being alienation from the phenomenal world, but my own
take is that full appreciation of the phenomenal world only comes from
the ability to view it from the afar of conceptuality.

By the way, now that I'm posting two minute items close together, I'm
reminded of the Buffalo site's daily quantity-of-posts maximum of 50.
It shuts down for a day if more than 50 posts are made to it in any
24-hour period, or something like that.  Does this site have anything
similar?

The "poem" for Thanksgiving not only sucks, its bad history.

Subject: friends of Kathy Acker


As some of you may have heard, Kathy Acker is in crisis.  She is in a
hospital in Tijuana with cancer of the lung, liver and spleen.  She is very
weak and her only hope is the combined holistic and allopathic treatment she
is receiving at American Biologics' clinic.  But this help is costly and her
financial resources are on the verge of running out.  She has no medical
insurance.  Like many artists and writers, she was never able to secure
benefits from any institution.

Kathy Acker was diagnosed with breast cancer in April 1996.  Shortly
thereafter she had a full mastectomy and there was some involvement in her
lymph nodes.  After the surgery she underwent extensive alternative therapies
in San Francisco, then moved to London to be with friends in August '96.
 (This period is described in "The Gift of Disease")  Over the summer of 1997
she suffered increasingly bad health, ranging from digestive disorders to
pneumonia.  Once back in  San Francisco in the fall, her condition worsened
and she finally was taken to the emergency room by Sharon Grace and Matias
Viegener.  At Davies Medical Center, she was told she had advanced cancer of
the liver, pancreas, spleen, and lungs.

In the hospital, she was given few options but morphine and hospice care;
Kathy chose to persue alternative treatment.  On November 1, she was taken to
American Biologics, a holistic integrated health clinic in Tijuana, Mexico.
Thanks to treatment she is getting there, and her strong will, her condition
is stable. However, she is running out of money.   $28,000 of her savings of
approximately $40,000 have already been spent in hospitalization in Mexico,
and the bills from 8 days in Davies Medical Center in SF are already past
$30,000 (these we hope to defer indefinitely; Medicare is still pending for
at least part of them).  The financial crisis is looming.

We have made arrangements with the John Giorno Fund for Artists with AIDS to
be the receiver of any contributions (which would make them tax-deductible,
and 100% of the donations will go to Kathy's bills).  The address is Giorno
Poetry Systems, 222 Bowery NY NY 10012; the check itself may be made out to
JOHN GIORNO and on the memo line write "Kathy Acker Fund."

Kathy has a solid core of people caring for her and is happy with American
Biologics' hospital, where Matias Viegener, Amy Scholder, Sylvere Lotringer,
Ira Silverberg, and David Antin among others have been with her.  As phone
calls tend to exhaust her now, she asks that people who are concerned write
her c/o American Biologics, Chula Vista, CA 91911 (this is the American
office of the clinic).

Anything you can do would be appreciated.  Please forward this email to
anyone you believe can help.

Thank you,

For Brian Carpenter & any interested others:

Hugh Kenner delivered a weeks' worth of this year's Massey Lectures on the
CBC radio program, "Ideas," last week. It may (indeed, probably will) be
re-broadcast next summer, but it should certainly be made available in book
form eventually. I forget the title, but he was dealing, very wittily the
one segment I heard, with the culture of travel & bordercrossings etc. A
kind of popular summing up of a lot of the ideas he has promoted throughout
his career.

On another note:

between old gossip & new views of the pilgrim fathers etc, the 'bad poems'
eally did their proper job, & how I do like the proper in poetry... thanks
to all who cared enough to send their very worst...

Bob,

both are true, aren't they? Sure they are. Just different. That's why
literacy is a price. You get the full appreciation, but it is from the afar
of conceptuality. Mind you, who's defining 'full appreciation'? Mr.
Phenomenal or Mr. Conceptual?

Brian,

it was on "Ideas" every night last week, from 9 to 10 p.m. Kenner was this
year's Massey Lecturer, which is a big deal. He spoke on "The Elsewhere
Community". Basically, his thesis was that western culture has been
fertilized since at least Homer by the need to gain knowledge, and to gain
this knowledge from somewhere else. More or less, it was a talk about
mentorship. One night was Pound, another Joyce, another Williams, with
anecdotes about Eliot, Beckett, Moore, Lowell, Homer, and a lot more
besides.

You can get a text or taped copy from the CBC or a text copy, soon, through
your bookstore.

The text is called "The Elsewhere Community" and it will be published by
House of Anansi Press. The CBC will send you a copy for CDN$19. They will
send you a set of tapes for CDN$53. The charges include shipping and taxes.
Who knows if there is an extra charge for the U.S.

write to:
Massey Lectures, Ideas Transcripts, P.O. Box 500, Station A, Toronto,
Ontario, Canada, M5W 1E6.

By the way, CBC is available on RealAudio, for people in Bosnia, Bulgaria,
Slovakia, and, I suppose, the Autonomous Republic of Seattle.

Best,

Harold Rhenisch gave me a question that might be the very first I've
ever gotten from our discussion group that I KNOW I can answer with no
fear of (sane) contradiction when he asked, "Who's defining 'full
appreciation' (of the phenomenal world)?  Mr. Phenomenal or Mr.

anything.

Still, what would Mr. Phenomenal have to say about that? We can only guess.
Very rightly you hint that he would have nothing to say. So?

I propose using the considerable resources of the western capitalist de
mock race ease to erect a sliding barrier between the phenomenal and the
conceptual, a barrier porous enough that a traveller starting out in the
mountains of Phenomena could set off on a long journey across the steppes,
s journey so long that when said traveller arrived at Mr. Concept's door,
the traveller could speak only of the journey, in bright images, and any
conceptual links would be incidental, and would, conceptually speaking, be
the journey. Poor Mr. Concept would have to set out on the reverse journey.
A conceptual conversation would ensure, surely, but it could not be
reduced. To reduce it to anything else would be to step outside it. Poof!
Mr. Concept would be sitting on his doorstep again, smoking his pipe in the
evening, watching the sublime sun set through the sublime old fruit trees
of abandoned orchards, and he would not even know that he was still on a
journey, because he would have no phenomena by which to experience it.

Insanely,

Harold

Yes, Bob, but that formulation, "experience protects one from concepts," is
conceptual. I agree that wisdom gleaned from experience gives one a wise
mistrust of concepts, even though that too is a concept. But that wasn't
all I was after when I wrote, "Concepts protect us from experience. So she
had conceived." One, I imagined a concept, in "her" mind, as a condom;
rejecting its use, she becomes pregnant ("so she had conceived.") I wanted
to imply there is a price to pay for pooh-poohing the conceptual. But there
is a price to pay for operating only via conceputal wisdoms--one of which
might be the extinction of life itself ("for who would fardels bear"...or
babies!? )

I don't think the balance you name quite operates by that sort of symmetry.
I doubt that unconceptualized experience is available to us, so I don't see
the conceptual and the experiential as true opposites. Granted, this is
subject to a further turn of the screw, whereby, in order to preserve any
meaning at all for the word _experience_ , we can argue that if all our
experience is only experience of the conceptual, then that _is_ what
experience means, ands that _is_ experience.

But out of such bottlenecks there is sometimes a way, if only via a
retreat. Reading Merleau-Ponty is not the same as reading Fichte. So the
"retreat" is from the general absolute towards the realm of the particular,
which is I take it a phenomenological tack. For instance, I have now quite
forgotten how this "literacy" thread turned into this concept v. phenomenon
thread. David

David,

I think I'm with you all the way on this one.  Although I did miss the
concept/condom pun.  I don't think it's concept versus the phenomenal
but concept added to the phenomenal world.  I just saw a chance to make
a quick score (I thought) on behalf of one of my buzz
dogmas: the unreflected-on life isn't worth living.

I don't know how this discussion got started, either, but I do know I'm
still having trouble with being in two discussion groups, this one and
the modern poetry one, especially when someone like Harold R. writes two
letters that arrive here at the same time, one to each group.  So I've
been answering some letters from thread in this group to the other group
and vice versa.  That includes the following comment for this concept/
phenomenal world thread that explains my position a little more:

As for pore Mister Conceptual's attempt to tell of his journey through
the phenomenal world, you described it well.  The conceptual must be
founded on the sensual, or phenomenal.  In fact, in my decidedly
uncertified theory of psychology (now you're in for it), I call that
part of the brain that deals with sensory information The Fundaceptual
Awareness.  The conceptual part of the brain I call The Reducticeptual
Awareness.  There are other -ceptual awarenesses I refuse to reveal at
this time, but hope to discuss at a personal website before too long.
Nothing too original about these awarenesses; they mostly follow Howard
Gardner's ideas--which, in turn, are not particularly original, either.

It's Buy Nothing Day, and I haven't bought a thing. But now
I'm wondering: Is the nature of that act (or non-act) mainly
phenomenal or conceptual? Is "not-buying" phenomenal things for a day
something like an _idea_  with no phenomenal status at all, like, for
example, the "just yet" in "I have to go to the bathroom after all
that turkey, but I'm not going to go_ just yet_"? (I think
Wittgenstein said something like that.) Or is it _commodities_ that
are purely conceptual and their "thingness" only index of a
phenomenally (historical relations of production, exchange, etc.)
constructed fetishism which is, of course, ideological and thus
conceptual through and through? In other words, are social relations
and our actions that help make them up (like buying or not-buying)
_more real_ than all those apparent "things" up for sale? (I think
Marx said something like that.)

But what if not-buying really_is_ just a concept? I mean if
commodities are only conceptual in nature and my one-day act of
resistance to them is, from an ontological standpoint (am I using
ontological correctly here?), not disimilar from them, then is it
possible that "buying-nothingness" is actually a kind of commodity
(like a scentless perfume suddenly all the rage) that enters into a
deeper set of real and existing relations that are obscured from me?

And is that question in any way applicable to all poetry today?

I honestly don't know, and it's driving me so crazy that I'm just
glad I bought twice as much to drink yesterday knowing that I
wouldn't be buying anything today. Cheers to the violence within
that protects us from the violence without.

By the way, did anyone notice that David Bromige's supposedly "bad"
entry for the Turkey Award, "A Thanksgiving Poem That Would Be Bad
If Only It Could", is actually a sustained quantitative alternation
(albeit with a few variations) of Alcaic and Sapphic verses? I have
an eye for these things ever since I discovered that Tennyson's
"Hesperides," generally considered to be a failed poem because it
doesn't scan accentually, is a quantitative experiment with the
amphimacer as insistent meter within longer aeolic units. It fits
with the theme: Hercules was originally from Crete. I almost got the
paper published in Victorian Poetry, but one of the readers said that
surely, if ALT had intended such, we would find something in his
notes and letters about it! Talk about stuffy...

no no, they're not only conceptual in nature.  They have physical
substantiation.

If you try to say they're only conceptual, I'm just not buying it.

I don't know, but I just checked out the "Cafe Nirvana" on the
Tricycle site (http://www.tricycle.com/ ).  The slogan might be
germane to this discussion? --

Can anyone point me toward more information on the 1994 festschrift on
Barbara Guest? (I'm starting from point zero--all I know is that such a
thing did happen--so any and all leads would be greatly appreciated.)

Found poetics department--and a reminder to be really specific about those
web search parameters--you wouldn't *believe* the number of women named
Barbara who have guest books on their web pages.

thanks--

Dear Kent,

Does "The Hesperides" have another title?  I can't find it in my complete
Tennyson.  And now  I'm very curious. . ..

This is also the first I've heard of a connection between cretics and
Crete. Do you know more about that and could you point me to a reference?

My Princeton ency. has led me to an inconsequential poem of ALT's in
cretics called "The Oak," b ut that's it.

Annie..

I just returned from two weeks in Paris, where I
was participating in the poetry Biennale; accordingly
I was unable to participate in the conversations
surrounding J Laughlin and New Directions. However,
while in Paris, the LA WEEKLY asked me to write a
small piece of Laughlin, and I thought some of you
might be interested in my comments.

I write from Paris, where, for literary reasons, I have
been visiting the great cemetaries of thecity: Pere Lachaise,
Montparnasse, Montmartre and Passy. And suddenly the
writer Jerome Rothenberg reports the death of James Laughlin.
I use the word SUDDENLY, not because one did not expect
the death--J, as his friends called him, was 83--but because
for so many decades now, Laughlin's publishing house, New
Directions, has demonstrated that there could be something
in American literature other than that produced by the
commerical conglomerates, and because those of us who took
that lesson to heart could never have properly prepared
ourselves for its founder's passing and, thus, its possible
absence from the American scene.
    The young would-be poet who visited Ezra Pound in
Italy certainly did not appear a likely candidate for either
profession. As the heir to the Inland Steel company, he
might have been expected to have chosen other, less problematic
avocations. Pound pronounced Laughlin "not much of a poet"
and suggested he "do something useful like publishing." It
is part of Laughlin's genius that he took Pound's advice--
along with his writing.
     Beginning in 1936, Laughlin began to publish Pound and
the work of othr poets recommended to him: William Carlos
Williams, Dylan Thomas, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, and
Kenneth Rexroth (who himself would later serve as an un-
official advisor). He reprinted important works of American
fiction such as Djuna Barnes's NIGHTWOOD, Gertrude Stein's
THREE LIVES and Nathanel West's MISS LONLEYHEARTS, and added
drama to his list with the plays of Tennessee Williams.
     What was even more amazing about Laughlin, however, was
that he not only published these authors--there have been a
number of wealthy men and women who have treated publishing
as a philanthropic hobby--but committed himself to many of
these writers over several decades, bringing out their every
book. From his home in Connecticut and his somewhat dowdy but
serviceable offices in New York, Laughlin built up a loyal and
partisan staff of editors--who through the years have included
the late Robert MacGregor (for many years his right-hand man),
Griselda Ohannessian, the translator and novelist Peter Glassgold,
Peggy Fox, Barbara Epler and others--helping him to acquire and
edit books by some of the most important writers of the century:
Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Eugenio Montale, Federico Garcia Lorca,
St.-John Perse, Raymond Queneau, Octavio Paz, Mikhail Bulgakov,
Anonio Tacucchi, Clarice Lispector, Kamu Braithwaite, and
Bei Dao, to name only a few.
    American writing, however, remained at the center of New
Directions' ventures. Its list of American writers is for-
midable, including John Hawkes, Robert Duncan, Michael McClure,
Henry Miller, Gary Snyder, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Guy Davenport,
Toby Olson, Jerome Rothenberg, David Antin, and, in recent years,
Bernadette Mayer, Susan Howe, Michael Palmer, and my own
collection of writers of "Language" poetry.
     Laughlin was not only loyal and imaginativae in his pub-
lishing activities, but, despite Pound's abjuration, he con-
tinued to write his own poetry--was prolific in fact. He gen-
erally chose not to publish his own poems, which may have
contributed to his neglect. But in recent years, collections
have appeared under the imprints of several smaller presses,
and his POEMS: NEW AND SELECTED is dure out this spring from
New Directions.
     The poet-publisher is a rarity, and James Laughlin brought
something far more importnat than money and commitment to
publishing; he brought a vision--in a period of an ever-expanding
drive for simplicity of information, in a time of news "briefs"
and "blips," computer "hits," and formulaic writing in literature,
film and television--a vision that believed in the complexity
of human language and thought. The books of New Directions
are generally entertaining and enjoyable to read, but they offer
something more: human confusion, uncertainty, doubt. When
reading them, one is often frustrated, pained, angered, even
infuriated. In breif, they represent the beautifully rich
and terrorizing tapestry of human life. No bromides, quick
winks and asides, no stereotypical characterizations here.
For years Laughlin's books appeared bound in covers printed
only in black and white; it was almost as if the books them-
selves invited careful scrutiny before one entered their
pages. And when one did enter, the entire world opened up.
     It is hard to explain that effect on young and often
starving minds. In the middle of Iowa, my adolescent fists
found that the books of this great poet-publisher were a
natural fit, and the mind was made to come alive.

Does anybody have an address, physical or virtual, for Natacha Lallemand, a
student at the Sorbonne? If so, please back-channel me or call directly.

Thanks!
