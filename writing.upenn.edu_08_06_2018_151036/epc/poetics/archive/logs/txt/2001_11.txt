poetry. Pour it on: Sacrifice yourself to the Muse!! Be poaterrarasticalist;
get into some heavy pessimism man... Just joking. Take care: dont shoot
you're wife with an apple on her head?!!  Your poems are little gleams of

Don't forget the "they" changes as well. There are the "they" who are
Israeli and there are others like myself who are still wanderers,
outsiders, exiles, but not from a nation-state, and hopefully our ideas
are still flowing. Please do not confuse the two groups; I think Chomsky
for example was born Jewish.

It makes people feel better to get a B than an F.  And they still know that

was good.  I think complaints about grade inflation come mostly from the

They do come from those quarters, for that reason.  And that's a very good
reason.  Smart, hardworking students are what?  Just annoying elitists?  Hmmm
. . .  The complaints do come from elsewhere also.  They come from businesses
who hire B students only to discover they have literacy problems.  The
companies then complain at the top of their lungs to the colleges
responsible, and in some cases the reputations of these colleges have taken
nose dives as a result, causing parents to send their children elsewhere.  Of
course, if B were widely understood as a bad grade, there would be no
problem.  But B is still considered an indicator of above average work.  At
my college, we recently received e-mails from the administration on this
subject.  We're to more accurately reflect a students ability in our grading.
 The impetus for this sudden concern?  Big increase in enrollment.  Healthy
bottom line -- everyone suddenly has scruples.  Best, Bill

Which, George, as your response implies, argues that this present crazy and
paranoid response by Bush and Blair etal is rather precipitate and very
probably futile. By the way I saw a book in a S/H shop on the machinations
of various in Canada over oil (which book included a discussion of
Alaska)... Anyway: the point is how to  bring about a better environment
everywhere where such as Mr Antin neednt have to be subject to the kind of
simplistic propaganda from Bush and so on ...and now thousands of youngmen
are going owards there (possible, probable?) and probably unneccessary and
futile deaths (if the war is not described by vets of it as futile it'll be
a first!! Young men: always they sacrifice the young to their greed or to
their fears. Regards, Richard.

Joel. I think that the right wing in Israel and the US are using the
"ordinary" Jews to spuriously unite them: it would also be the case if the
Muslims were all "united" unanimously. Obviously they all think their own
thoughts (its not good they are trialing this film maker in Iran - thew
procedure there is protest and negotiatioon and petitions (not war)): of
course one doesnt remounce one's culture history and beliefs but one retains
sufficient nous and skepticism: I could be a "loyal" and enthusiastic(!)
American and also very very critical of US policy: similarly I know that if
I were an Israeli i would not support evrything...I would want an army but I
would also want less interference from outside and also: the people of the
world must, in the long run, unite. I would be prepared to share the Levant
with the Palestinians:(I know that that is easier said than done) and I
think that one day we willl find that we all are human: as Shakespear showed
us in "The Merchant of Venice" ... if I were Jewish I dont think I would
like to be identified with Israel per se: I am of two English parents and
have pride in my British inheretence but am well aware of the terrible and
stupid(and good) things that British history has thrown up....no illusion
that I am of  special nation. I dont support  evrything my own Prime
Minister here... in New Zealand... does and certainly am very dubious of
Blair: doesnt mean I hate the man: I;ve never met him.....but maybe history
will prove me wrong....(I mean for think that Blair is a bit of an
idiot!)...anycase (we)  I am as good as or as bad as... a man who lives in a
hut in Africa: we are all of the same human family. Richard.

New Green Integer title


Green Integer is pleased to announce the publication of a new title: =
Zuntig by Tom La Farge.

Tom La Farge's new novel revisits the animal world he created in his =
acclaimed The Crimson Bears and A Hundred Doors. The protagonist, Zuntig =
the Swamp Ape, makes a bid for dominance in her tribe but fails. Facing =
destruction, she discovers that she can change her shape and restart her =
story as another sort of animal. As she shifts, every new body imposes =
its own desires and sends Zuntig hunting for the habitat where it will =
be at home. As her search changes, so does her story. She becomes a =
herring and swims upriver to breed against a stream of consciousness. =
She becomes a lemming, finds mates and propagates in a season of =
courtship Jane Austen might have described. Her encounter as an auk with =
Ocean is told in swelling Shelleyan blank verse, and her plunge into the =
Ice Matrix mimics Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" as revised =
by Emily Dickinson, William Blake, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. But in each =
new shape she retains the memory of her first home and story, built into =
her physical being and fighting her adaptation to new environments. The =
sunstruck hills of the Bilijub Desert, the flow of the river Flood, the =
snow-tunnels of Hyver, the empty ocean's dreaming, even the fabulous Pig =
Opera of Bargeton: none of these is a niche were Zuntig can adapt until =
she resolves her unfinished business in the Swamp. The result is a =
fantasy that--as a reviewer in American Book Review noted of The Crimson =
Bears--will "be the source of a new Nile," akin to the great fantasy =
writing of J.R.R. Tolkien.
     Tom La Farge is a teacher in New York City. His collection of tales =
Terror of Earth won the 1996 America Award for the best new work of =
fiction.

As usual, we offer this book for list members at a 20% discount. The =
book retails at $13.95. With a discount and $1.50 for postage and =
handling, the total comes to $12.66.

We also offer The Crimson Bears and A Hundred Doors, as well as Terror =
of Earth at a 40% discount.
With postage that's $9.27 for the first two titles, and $8.67 for the =
last.

Online Chat: Sunday 4th November: ALT-X Press free ebooks

Joint ELO/trAce chat: the new Alt-X Press brings to web-readers a must-have
library of uncategorizable writing being produced by some of the most
provocative artists in contemporary new media culture. Your timezone

our=21&min=0&sec=0&p1=136

As digital writing makes its footprint into the electrosphere, we no longer
ask "What is literature?" but, more importantly, "What is literature's exit
strategy?" These full-length works of art are now available in ebook and
Palm Pilot formats and will soon be available as Print On-Demand (POD)
titles. The eight inaugural titles include previously unpublished work by
postmodern fiction masters George Chambers, Ron Sukenick and Raymond
Federman, screen-based auteur Nile Southern, new media stars Mark Amerika,
Alan Sondheim, Eugene Thacker and Adrienne Eisen, and a collection of
Neuromantic Fiction from the Black Ice archives. The best part about it all?
These ebooks are available to you for free. In a time of economic downturn
and dot.com uncertainty, Alt-X perseveres and continues its mission to
http://www.altx.com/ebooks

Guest authors will be Alan Sondheim, Nile Southern and Matt Samet

Chats are on Sundays at 21:00 London, 16:00 New York, 22:00 Rome, 14:00

If one's house is infested with mice, get a cat.  So much for metaphors that
equate humans with rodents -- but then.... xenophobic rats?

Mime-Version: 1.0

I've been wandering around a bit in the Data base of twentieth-century
African American poetry, which our library has just accessed for us -- it
describes itself thusly:

This database of modern and contemporary African American poetry includes
collected poems and individual volumes
     from all the major movements and schools of twentieth century African
American poetry from 1902 to the present day.


If you check it out, you will probably come to agree with me that this
description is not entirely accurate -- I think most of you will be able to
identify some glaring absences -- On the other hand, this data base makes
some crucial items, like four volumes of Russell Atkins, available to
wide-spread readers who might not find the texts in their local libraries ---

So, I'd advise those of you who advise libraries to advise adoption --- but
we sure could use a data base that includes ALL the poets ----

Subject:      No Peace in Our Time, No Justice
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I continue to be disturbed by David Antin's metaphor of mice for Osama bin
Laden and the Al Qaeda network: things to be killed relentlessly, vermin,
unhuman. This is dangerous language in the national debate (such as it is)
and completely disgusting for a poet to use. (Forgive me if I hold poets to
higher standards than other mortals.)

Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network are murderers, fascists, thugs. I
favor their capture and arrest. I am not optimistic enough to believe that
this could happen without the use of military force. By capturing bin Laden
and dismantling the "network" I believe there may be a possibility for
justice and peace. However, by just keeping abreast of news reports from a
wide variety of sources over the past month leads me to believe that there
will be no peace. And there will certainly be no justice. Certainly not for
the victims killed in NYC, DC, and Penn. In other words, I wish to discuss
the current war, but I will not even mention the obvious hyporcrisy.

If I remember correctly, the Bush administration never had certain
intelligence on the whereabouts of bin Laden. This was true up thru the
beginning of the bombing. It's true now; no one knows where he is. No
matter: the US said it would go after "the global terrorist network" and
the states that harbor them. Sudan and Saudi Arabia have also harbored bin
Laden and his network. Obviously these states have since repented, but
there are no guarantees that they are not next on the bombing list. OK: the
US is bombing Afghanistan, where the US is pretty sure bin Laden does not
reside. His training camps were destroyed, probably in about fifteen
minutes on the first or second day of bombing. As October came and went the
war escalated in subtle ways. More sorties, more bombings. Then the
bombings were "stepped up," then the bombings became "round the clock," and
in today's paper the continued "carpet bombing" is discussed in successful
terms, although no end of the bombing is in sight and more troops are
needed on the ground to help aim the bombs. In mid-September Afghanistan
was a country with very little military targets. You've got to wonder
what's going on over there.

But you're not supposed to question it. The US was attacked and thousands
of people died horribly. Now we're all supposed to fall into line (right
behind Dan Rather) and look to "our" president who two months ago was an
incompetent boob, as was the FBI.

Is it possible that David Antin has correctly guessed the objective of the
US campaign in Afghanistan? That is, the "counterattack" (this is wrong on
Antin's part; not a "counterattack" as Afghanistan did not attack the US)
must be so immense and devestating that the Taliban (presumably that's who
he means) "don't survive or survive with so much damage that it inhibits
their abilities to strike again"? Well, again, the Taliban didn't attack us
but it is now the stated US goal to overthrow the Taliban. But they're a
friendless and tyrannous regime so no one cares enough to make the
distinction. And yet the distinction is important. Will it be more
important when the US plans the next campain in the so-called War on Terror?

Let's remember for a moment the last government the US attacked so
overwhelmingly that "it inhibits their abilities to strike again." Iraq
proved to be a pretty resilient group of fellows also. Yet, ten years after
laying the country of Iraq to waste (which is no exaggeration) the US can
still invoke Saddam Hussein as a devil incarnate with awesome powers. Are
we to face ten years of starving Afghanistan, bleeding it till it bends to
US wishes, with periodic and under-reported bombing? (How many poems can
one publish in that time? What kind of thesis can you finish?) Is this
justice for not turning over bin Laden? The links between Iraq and the
anthrax scares are dwindling in public statements. If it turns out that an
American individual or group is responsible for the mailings, to what
extent do you favor a military response?

In his manifesto for the "new kind of war" Secretary Rumsfeld (New York
Times, 9/27/01) seems almost pleased at the prospects. Too long to quote in
full, too surreal to leave anything out, here's a sample: "... it is easier
to describe what lies ahead by talking about what it is not rather than
what it is... [a war which] will involve floating coalitions of countries,
which may change and evolve.. Some will help us publicly, while others,
because of their circumstances, may help us privately and secretly. In this
war, the mission will define the coalition---not the other way
around....Our response may include firing cruise missiles into military
targets somewhere in the world; we are just as likely to engage in
electronic combat to track and stop investments moving through offshore
banking centers. The uniforms of this conflict will be bankers' pinstripes
and programmers' grunge just as assuredly as desert camouflage. This is not
a war against an individual, a group, a religion or a country. Rather, our
opponent is a global network of terrorist organizations and their state
sponsors, committed to denying free people the opportunity to live as they
choose...Even the vocabulary of this war will be different. When we 'invade
the enemy's territory,' we may well be invading his cyberspace. There may
not be as many beachheads stormed as opportunities denied. Forget about
'exit strategies'; we're looking at a sustained engagement that carries no
deadlines... The public may see some dramatic military engagements that
produce no apparent victory, or may be unaware of other actions that lead
to major victories."

A hawk's wet dream. Indefinite in time, strategy, and approach. Mysterious
and secret allies. Allegiance swapping. All that's required for true
success is keeping US deaths to a minimum. We've been prepared as a public
for this by being told the costs will be great. Rumsfeld cynically begins
by reversing the old adage: the first casualty of war is truth. Not so for
us he says; we're being very up front about Lying as an integral stratgey
to victory. What is victory? Don't know. The war is sure to dwindle (with
plenty of "victory" to show when necessary) when the next presidential
campaign gets underway but certainly not before, not too soon. Do I think
the government is enjoying this? Yes. They have unprecedented power and
they're going to do everything in their power to keep it and expand it.
Why? Because the threats will be endless. The gov't is our protector now in
ways not easily imagined before. But how much will you let them do? How far
will you let them go?

I continue to be disturbed by David Antin's metaphor of mice for Osama bin
Laden and the Al Qaeda network. Isn't this similar to what the Japanese
were as a US enemy in WW2? We dropped two, not one, not none (e.g. Germany)
atomic bombs on their civilians. "Had to:" You couldn't reason with them
like other enemies. Isn't the extermination of mice redolent of racist
genocide?

How are you going to know a terrorist from a non-terrorist? Are you
studying the FBI most-wanted list now as a means of making the world a more
just place to live in? You're going to let Rumsfeld tell you how things stand?

Secretary Rumsfeld has a second installment of his manifesto in today's
Washington Post. Did you believe that 9/11 would cause the US to think
seriously about its role in the world, perhaps attempt to sow the seeds of
peace in areas of the world which most need it? (I did: sucker!) I don't
say this as a plea to capitulate or appease the people who would just as
soon see me dead, etc. What I'm trying to say is that the events of 9/11
have had ZERO effect on the US government, except as a useful means in
which to further their own agenda. Today Rumsfeld announced that he (and
others like him) have been right all along. What "we" need to do in the
next ten years is not engage with the world and help to make it a more
peaceful place, but build bigger and better weapons because attacks on the
US like that of September 11 will become a regular aspect of life in the
US. (Professor Perloff, what does your gardner think of that?) Rumsfeld's
report ("Quadrennial Defense Review") was written before 9/11 and it
basically says we need to spend billions of dollars to create a star wars
anti-missile defense. He writes "in important ways, these attacks [9/11]
confirm the strategic direction and planning principles that resulted from
this review -- particularly its emphasis on homeland defense, on preparing
for surprise and asymmetric threats, on the need to develop new concepts of
deterrence, on the need for a capabilities-based strategy and on the need
to balance the different dimensions of risk to include the risks to people,
modernization and transformation along with war-fighting risks."

How's that for respect and tribute to the victims of 9/11? A trillion
dollar mouse trap for Antin's mice.

Rumsfeld: "Yes, we must win the war on terrorism. But as we do so, we must
also prepare for the next war. We owe it to our children and grandchildren."

I seriously believe he means we owe to our children and grandchildren to
have "the next war" prepared for them, ready to go. His actions ensure it.

I've taught off and on since 1968, at a variety of institutions, from
Columbia College to community colleges. The psychological pressures to pass
semiliterate students have increased as the proportion of such in classes
has increased. How does one live with flunking all but two students who
come into a Freshman Comp class with absolutely no skills and leave several
years short of acquiring enough to write even a business letter, let alone
comprehend a complex text? Or how about a working adult single mother who
earned a C+ in an American Lit course but needed a B- to get her into a
professional licensing program in a completely different field that would
allow her to better provide for her chuildren? I think if you questioned
your peers with these examples in mind you'd hear about a lot of slippage.

No, Millie, the issue is more that students leave prerequisite courses
still unprepared for the next courses or for what happens beyond college.
You wouldn't have noticed this much at Columbia, which accepts very bright
and unusually well-prepared students and then puts them thru two years of
rigorous general education.

Those of us with a long memory are aware that even the quality of graduate
student preparation has dropped disasterously.=20

It makes people feel better to get a B than an F.  And they still know that
the B is a bad grade, so it's not as if there is no way to tell if your
paper was good.  I think complaints about grade inflation come mostly from
the people who got A's and want everyone to know that _their_ A's were
real, not inflated...

Could the Carlyle group be using _Le Figaro_ to widen the rift between the
US and France?  That is, they're reporting anti-CIA stories, but only in
France, not in the US.   And there's always the chance that the story is a
fnord, possibly for tracking the story's distribution (gasp), possibly
poised to undercut all CIA-bin Laden connection stories.  Another
possibility is that the hand does not know what the eye is seeing.

The French and the US have certainly been fighting with each other for
resources in Central Africa.  At least with respect to the intelligence
community, the merc orgs, and the big bucks that back these militaristic
operations, the divisions are wide and have been for at least 7 years.
Divisions ARE profitable, especially if they lead to war and you're an
international banker/financier with heavy investments in the armaments and
raw materials trade.  Maybe having justification for picking a bone with the
French is what these guys are looking to develop.  Maybe it's a tactic
designed to force France away from the Holy See program and more towards the
US/Brit one, something that could take years.  Who knows....

I also hear that Le Figaro is (part?) owned by the Carlyle Group, the
DC-based employers of bush sr. and numerous ex-cia types and other
unsavory characters; and recipients of a $2 million investment from the
Binladin Group.  what it all means I cannot say.  more on Carlyle here:

Bin Laden 'met CIA agent before terror attacks'

A French newspaper claims a US intelligence agent met Osama bin Laden in a
Gulf hospital two months before the terror attacks on New York.

Le Figaro said the meeting took place between July 4 and 14, while bin
Laden was being treated for a serious kidney ailment at the American
Hospital in Dubai.

During his stay at the hospital, bin Laden was visited by members of his
family and the local representative of the CIA, said Le Figaro.

The newspaper claims the CIA agent later boasted to several friends that
he had visited the Saudi terror mastermind who at that time was wanted for
the bombings of US embassies in Africa and the attack on the destroyer
Cole in Yemen.

In Dubai, he was reportedly treated by Dr Terry Callahan, a specialist in
kidney ailments and male infertility.

He refused to comment.

The American Hospital in Dubai denies that bin Laden had ever been a
patient.

Several sources had reported that bin Laden had a serious kidney
infection. He had a mobile dialysis machine sent to his Kandahar hideout
in Afghanistan in the first half of 2000, according to "authoritative
sources" quoted by Le Figaro and French radio.

My little jet plane
with wings of beagles
has turned into a rowboat,
its hide bottom and teak gunwales
wallowing in this week's low tide.
Unless you're on a juice fast
in the high Sierras
everything is changing this week.
Buildings lose their substance
as smoke assumes the form of claws.
It is difficult to do business
in the burgeoning cloud.
For four days only birds
fly and the common man
reestablishes basic contact with clouds.
I fall in love with right angles
and in the next minutes become
passionate about spoons.
Nothing solid holds
my attention, but the problem
with water is to hit it
will not make it break.
May I borrow your tie
to get myself admitted
to the moment of interspacial tears?
Still the Beloved calls
to order me to open
the Wilson Woodshed.
When the world stops rhyming
people still need boards.
The fewer knot-holes the better,
because in every home
we are looking to finally shore
up the core.
I thought about giving up.
I thought about the Foreign Legion.
For now I'm holding up two fingers
and counting and holding
up two more.

Sure
but that isnt why USAUK is bombing them

Nor will the northern alliance give it them

Nor does it make any sense to be bombing and starving people in order to
give them medical care

I know little about US health care, but I do know there are a few problems
over access. I am doubtful about medical care as a motive from a country
without a national health care system

(I'm just off now to get some health care - no charge at all, no means test:
that's how it needs to be, though our dentistry and optical care needs
attention

The bombing will help reduce the numbers needing medical care of course -
post natal abortion on a massive scale

If, after all this, things improve for women in Afghanistan, that's good;
but it still won't have justified the bombing

The bombing is about something else entirely, the something else which led
to the Taliban being put there in the first place.

For an unlimited time only:


FAKE INTERVIEW (green smiley face)

With Mike E. Microwave and Susan Osiris-Armand

Not too short and not too long....See why the fake interview is the hot new
trend among the young collaborating set....Get the courage to try it out
yourself....Act like someone you're not for once....Empty fancy-shmancy
discourses at random....Poke fun at the way they talk like they so smart....


And while supplies of patience last: ANDREWS CHEAP SHOT (red smiley face)

Still furious about Bruce's recent speech on what he said in 1975?....Blow
off your post-language steam by reading this....Savor what seconds of
entertainment still can be had in these fearful times....Guaranteed to be
better than most car pool rides....See what subjectivity lies on the other
side of that nutcracking ballet parataxis....Hint: it isn't pretty

What contemporaries have to say about it:

"I really thought FAKE INTERVIEW was for real. It was like watching The
Blair Witch Project all over again, except in the form of an interview
between two poets."
-- Dan Rather, anchorman for the CBS Evening News

"FAKE INTERVIEW is a brilliant foray into pseudonymous authorship by
unacknowledgeable pioneers. I'm including it on my syllabus next semester
and am looking forward to the hypertext version."
-- Norman Anti-Norm, author of "How to Live a Longer, Happier and Fuller
Life Without Becoming an Author-Jerk"

"Whoever wrote ANDREWS CHEAP SHOT is secretly unsound, evil and very lonely.
A Black Mass without the usual Black Mass thingamajigs. I recommend it
highly."
-- God, supreme being

"I was simmering and ANDREWS CHEAP SHOT brought me to a boil. Never will I
be able to look at pro-creative activity in the same way."
--Ol' Dirty Bastard, rapper

Hi,

I missed the original posting of this, but in addition to the
suggestions from Richard Tyler, let me add a few folks to look into
as far as theories of dealing with texts and music, all more from the
music end of things:  Robert Ashley, Harry Partch, Arnold Schoenberg,
Leos Janacek, and Carl Orff. Kurt Schwitters discussions of how to
perform his Ur Sonata may also be useful to you.

You may also be interested in tape & digital sampler pieces based on
speech by composers such as David Mahler ("Voice of the Poet" &
"Hearing Voices"), Scott Johnson ("John Somebody" would be the best
example by him), & John Oswald ("Plexure"). & Alvin Lucier's setting
of John Ashbery's "Theme" is quite different form most text settings
and the process is fairly well described in Lucier's notes.

This is pretty much just off the top of my head, I'm sure I'll think
of more in the next few days.

Bests,

Herb

Gwyn.  I meant comparatively. Actually I admire the Taleban and Bin Laden
(unless he IS a CIA agent) but look at this: a New Zealand couple have been
living in Afghanistan as Christians for a few years now. They have two
young boys who get on well with the local children and the wife who spoke on
television (and I think she is a very intelligent person and also humane)
said that although she had to dress and act as the Muslim women do that she
also felt ok like that. In fact she said that "it depends on your
expectations"..and the women there are probably as well off  in terms of
treatment or ill treatment by men as in the United States....dont try and
tell me there is not a vast amount of murders and rapes and violence by
American men of American women: domestic violence is big time in New
Zealand....the thing they were trying to help with was drug addiction - now
I myself dont consider that a big deal as I use drugs myself: prescribed and
there are virtually no ill effects: just about evry man and dog I know is a
piss head or on marijauana or  worse: in fact I think the police have given
up on the huge illegal trade in drugs over here where in some parts its a
life style...but that aside, they had never been even questioned about their
beliefs as Christians and had many friends who were as they said "much like
our friends in New Zealand"...they didnt feel unsafe  even after S11, but
thought it wise to travel to Pakistan: but they want too go back.  Now I'm
not saying that they were great supporters or enthusiasts for the Taleban:
but they didnt paint the "terrible picture" which I think is based on
US-British distortions and crap fed to journalists and right-wingers who can
now say "look how terrible they are, the women wear covers over them, lets
bomb them, lets napalm them as we napalmed the men and women in Vietnam,
they're only Muslims, what the hell, get them before they get us..."   I
think that the Taleban would not survive without very very strong support
from the vast majorioty of Afghanis (remember the ones who ran away to
Australia were Shiite Muslims): they have defeated the Russians and
established  a stable state: a "democracy' would only be exploited and
corrupted by the US which (with its great contributions) I can see is not
that squeaky clean on the treatment of women, blacks and so on: and the
movies, the culture: a lot of it is amoral and corrupt. This the Muslims
see: ok maybe they are purists, but at least they have standards....why are
there so many school shootings in the marvellous USA? Bush is free of
illegalities? Nixon was a saint? Clinton didnt have sex while in office out
of wedlock? So many black people put in jail wrongly convicted? Are women so
wonderfully treated? How are your workeers paid: how strong are your unions?
Do "ordinary" people get ointo power in the US? How's the Mafia these
days?Pornography "pours" out of the US...one thinks of American women as Xs
and Ys (you fill in the missing words): of Eastern women as gentle and
decent...maybe another cliche.
  But dont take things out of what I say and play the feminist card: I'm
sick of that crap. Its done the West no good. Men no good. Its a screen for
"I am holier than thou."  The Taleban are fighters in a nation that has
defeated many enemies. I would send money to support them. I want them to
win. Richard.

Anyone who thinks they know what the Taliban are all about should read
William Vollman's piece on them in the New Yorker.  It is from 2 years
ago, but was recently up on their website.  Besides, it isn't as though
there aren't other regimes in the area (notably Saudi Arabia) that are
antifeminist, not to mention the rest of the world.  I wouldn't myself
make the relativist shrug here that Richard makes, but at the same time I
doubt that much attention would have been paid to the Taliban if they
weren't imbricated in terrorism against US (this was so before S11).  you
may think you aren't being manipulated when you makes such observations,
but in reality when we start paying attention to human rights as a
culture, be sure that there is a cui bono behind such attention.

FRI 11/2    POETRY DOG TAGS: NECK TO NECK HAIKU - HOSTED BY REGIE CABICO
Poetry Dog Tags will give your thoughts a place to hang out ... around your

WED 11/7    HAL WILLNER'S DOC POMUS PROJECT: A BENEFIT FOR THE POETRY
PROJECT
An evening of DOC POMUS' words and music, read and performed by his friends,
admirers and collaborators. Special guests include LOU REED, JIMMY SCOTT,
GARTH HUDSON, PETER GURALNICK and many more. An artist whose work, besides
being influential among musicians and songwriters, was essential to the
cultural life of New York City - both uptown and downtown. Legendary
singer-songwriter Doc Pomus (1925-1991) wrote, "The important thing is to be
the poet - not the famous poet - there are so many uncontrollable
intangibles that make up recognition and success." Over the past 50 years,
his words have become internationally famous in songs such as "Save the Last
Dance for Me," "Teenager in Love," "Viva Las Vegas," "This Magic Moment" and
"Young Blood." Inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of fame in 1992, his
songs have been recorded by, among others, Elvis Presley, the Drifters, Ray
Charles, and B.B. King. HAL WILLNER has produced records by Allen Ginsberg,
Lou Reed, Marianne Faithful, Laurie Anderson, Terry Southern, and Lenny
Bruce. Willner's film credits include the soundtracks for Robert Altman's
Shortcuts and Kansas City. $25 GENERAL ADMISSION, $20 FOR POETRY PROJECT
MEMBERS, $200 RESERVE TICKETS WITH SPECIAL GALA RECEPTION.[8:00 PM]

"The Koran is not like the Bible,

is altogether apocalyptic.

The Koran backs off from
that linear organization of time,
revelation, and history
which became the backbone

of orthodox Christianity
and remains the backbone
of the Western culture
after the death of God.

Islam is wholly apocalyptic
or eschatological,
and its eschatology
is not teleology.

The moment of decision,
the Hour of Judgment,
is not reached at the end of a line,
nor by a predetermined

cycle of cosmic recurrence;
eschatology can break out
at any moment. . . .
In fully developed

Islamic theology
only the moment is real."

Dan,

I made myself a promise to stay off Poetics for the sake of my mental
health during the next few weeks, but had to let you know how much the
basic sanity of your thinking here means to me. The fundamental
distinction that the "something (i.e., the Bush war, since we haven't
articulated anything as an alternative) must be done" crowd of ex-Left,
we-are-all-Americans-now folks fail to grasp is the one between present
U.S. military tactics and long-term (permanent?) U.S. military-economic
geopolitical strategy.

In other words, it's not simply a question of whether, a month and a
half after the WTC attacks, systematic carpet-bombing of Afghanistan
still feels like a proportionate or effective response. Of course, even
thus isolating the question, I'd still answer no, but I'm aware -- made
so, again, on a daily basis in the electronic media -- that I'm in the
minority here. But the question does not admit of such isolation -- the
U.S. would not be in Afghanistan if it did not represent a carefully
chosen starting point for the much larger series of military and
military-political campaigns. Certainly, as you've pointed out, the
stated proximate goal of "flushing out" bin Laden can no longer be seen
as credible.

The real question is thus whether the extension of the Afghanistan
campaign _at the will of the Defense Department_ to other nations, the
permanent adoption of recent civil liberties curtailments (with more
sure to follow), the long-term commitment to last month's giant
corporate bailouts and their ratification in structural form as a "war
economy" (always code for a massive transfer of public monies into
private hands), the abandonment of emergent internationalism (probably
the only benefit of the West's recent reliance on the Bretton Woods
institutions -- and  a tenuous one more dependent on the discourses
developed by the protest movements than the policies of "official"
representatives) in favor of a revanchist unilateralism, etc., etc. --
whether these permanent and systemic changes for the worse are still a
"proportionate response." Or whether, in terms only of military
pragmatics (i.e., capture/kill/incarcerate as  much of Al Qaeda as you
possibly can) they even make sense.

I pointed some of this out in the early days of the administration's
response in my posts to the list. At one point, I inverted an old slogan
of the U.S. ultra-left and invoked "one, two, many Afghanistans" as the
likely outcome of the adoption of Infinite Justice/Enduring Freedom's
(give us some time under the new regime and we'll all be asking how it
is to be endured) "open-ended" timeline and "flexible" goals.  Much
backchannel vitriol (including the promise of a letter of introduction
to the FBI) and front-channel lauding of the humanity and wisdom of
Hitchensism followed, under the heading of the "something must be done"
argument. And yes, something must be done -- but not this, and if the
choice is this or nothing, even from a dispassionate Realpolitik
standpoint, I suspect that in fifteen years we'll all wish we'd said
"nothing" a hell of a lot louder.

Of course, the choice between "this" and "nothing" is a false dichotomy,
as the advocates of an internationalist approach have consistently
maintained, recognizing the probable need for armed force, but tying
that to the accomplishment of legal (and probably more sustainable)
goals. One of these goals would have to be a searching, critical
realignment of vast sections of U.S. foreign policy. Sadly, the mass
discourse that has taken hold over the last month and a half has moved
from a justifiable, if debatable weak version of objection to such a
stance (i.e., "the first question must be one of response and security,
not internal fault-finding") to an intractable strong version which
holds that any questioning of U.S. prerogatives is tantamount to
"letting the terrorists win." A corollary emerges to supplement the
anguished "but something must be done" -- the angry refrain "and nothing
must change." (Except perhaps the First Amendment and various other
democratic luxuries).

What baffles me is that none of the government sources have really
changed their tune. It's still crystal clear that Afghanistan is simply
the tip of a big, bloody iceberg. But to hear the mass-mediated
recitations that pass for discussion of the situation (sadly, even among
fairly articulate remnants of the now-abdicatory Left), you'd think the
war was simply a matter of ousting the Taliban. Which is, in effect, to
substitute an unintentional PR coup the U.S. government stumbled into on
its way to waging global war, for the realities of the war itself. Even
restricting the viewfinder to Afghanistan itself, the continual emphasis
being placed by U.S. sources on the Masoud-Rabbani (now sans Masoud)
gangs of northern bandits, rapists and murderers as the best hope for
post-Taliban "stability" should be a wakeup call for anyone tempted to
believe, if only for a moment, that the conduct of this war is motivated
by compassion for the suffering of the Afghan people, and Afghan women
in particular.

We are being lied to at nearly every turn, except the opening gambit, in
which we are told that we will be lied to, and that the necessity of
this relation is the truth of our new republic. We will be asked to
substitute administration and pure, sovereign power for the
Machiavellian (in the real sense, not as a derogatory
epithet)/Renaissance constructivism which undergirds the best traditions
of U.S. constitutionalism. This is the tradition of creative power which
limns moments like the  following, from Shakespeare's Coriolanus, sent
to me in  a slightly different context by Norma Cole a few weeks back:
"What is the Citie but the People? True, the People are the Citie." The
present danger is that we will come to a definition of our "citie" which
posits it architecturally, as simply whatever finds itself centered
around the command and control bunker of its hidden sovereign.

New AVAM Exhibit Opens: The major art exhibit on "War and Peace" just opened
at
the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. We haven't had a chance to
see
it yet but we know that our artist, William Thomas Thompson is one of the
stars
of the show. William is the artist who did the 300 foot painting of the Book

criticizing anything" attempted shutdown lame. Oh bollocks. (/me
appropriates another culture's vernacular!) For the record, exactly how
much dues-paying does have to get put in criticizing one's own government
before one can get annoyed at the Taliban for doing similar bad things
more blatantly? If I may attempt to force this through the few pores in
the gentleman's skull, *I am not in favor of any bombing whatsoever*, but
it's not a Manichaean scene either: condemning the immorality (not
"amorality") of the current US aggression toward Afghanistan and its
people does not mean one has to rush over to the lot who mandate an
eight-centimeter beard as the sole path to human rights.

Bit of a difference between "merely" antifeminist and aggressively
anti-female. Both are cultural constructs, sure, but it's easier to be
proven physically female than feminist. (Actually, all us Damn Fem'nusts
have a bar-code on the sole of the left heel. Oops! I wasn't supposed to

Hi David,

I'm not so sure about there being no agenda related to oil in the current
miasma of objectives. I just have a feeling that when the smoke clears _ an=
d
it might be a long time (deputy PM here Prescott talked up a spring
destabilisation of the Taliban for 2002 at Prime Minister's question time
around the time that Bony Tear was being officially dressed down by Assad o=
n
Wednesday).

Here's an extract from John Pilger written over a month ago now

but first anextract from the Philapdelphia Action Center:

_____________

Ever since the fall of the former Soviet Union ten years ago, Exxon,  Mobil=
,
Chevron and the other big oil monopolies have been scheming to get  their
hands on the vast oil and gas wealth around the Caspian Sea, just  north of
Afghanistan.  This region=B9s oil reserves may reach more than 60  billion
barrels =AD enough to service Europe=B9s oil needs for 11 years.   Some
estimates are as high as 200 billion barrels.  The Caspian Sea  reserves ar=
e
10 percent of the world=B9s known supply =AD worth about $5  trillion at today=B9=
s
prices.

 In February 1998, Unocal Corporation testified to the House Committee on
Internal Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific that the =B3Taliban
government in Afghanistan is an obstacle=B2 to having an oil pipeline from
the Caspian region to the Indian Ocean =AD that is, through Afghanistan.   In
1997, Unocal even tried to woo the Taliban with billions of dollars to
support the proposed pipeline through their country. The unrecognized
Taliban government, however, was a set back to their plans.

 Having a government in Afghanistan that is beholden to U.S. interests,
along with stationing U.S. troops in the former Soviet Republics of
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, would secure the region and allow
this project to proceed.  And just in time, as far as the U.S. oil
companies are concerned, because there is international competition for  th=
e
Caspian Sea oil resources.

 Russia and German companies had been trying to establish a pipeline from
the Caspian Sea through Eastern Europe, but U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia
blocked this plan.  Russia, however, also brokered a treaty with Iran for  =
a
pipeline route.  China also began negotiating to build oil and gas
pipelines from Kazakhstan.  In January 2001, oil industry journals  lamente=
d
that any chance the U.S. had of cementing alliances in the  region seemed
doomed.  They noted, however, that the incoming Bush  administration, heavy
in oil and related interests, would likely try to  reverse this trend
(www.caucasuswatch.com).

_______________:

Moreover, the Taliban itself is a creation of the Americans and the
British.

In the 1980s, the tribal army that produced them was funded by the CIA and
trained by the SAS to fight the Russians.

The hypocrisy does not stop there. When the Taliban took Kabul in 1996,
Washington said nothing. Why? Because Taliban leaders were soon on their
way to Houston, Texas, to be entertained by executives of the oil company,
Unocal.

With secret US government approval, the company offered them a generous
cut of the profits of the oil and gas pumped through a pipeline that the
Americans wanted to build from Soviet central Asia through Afghanistan.

A US diplomat said: "The Taliban will probably develop like the Saudis
did." He explained that Afghanistan would become an American oil colony,
there would be huge profits for the West, no democracy and the legal
persecution of women. "We can live with that," he said.

Although the deal fell through, it remains an urgent priority of the
administration of George W. Bush, which is steeped in the oil industry.
Bush's concealed agenda is to exploit the oil and gas reserves in the
Caspian basin, the greatest source of untapped fossil fuel on earth and
enough, according to one estimate, to meet America's voracious energy
needs for a generation. Only if the pipeline runs through Afghanistan can
the Americans hope to control it.

So, not surprisingly, US Secretary of State Colin Powell is now referring
to "moderate" Taliban, who will join an American-sponsored "loose
federation" to run Afghanistan. The "war on terrorism" is a cover for
this: a means of achieving American strategic aims that lie behind the
flag-waving facade of great power.

The Royal Marines, who will do the real dirty work, will be little more
than mercenaries for Washington's imperial ambitions, not to mention the
extraordinary pretensions of Blair himself. Having made Britain a target
for terrorism with his bellicose "shoulder to shoulder" with Bush
nonsense, he is now prepared to send troops to a battlefield where the
goals are so uncertain that even the Chief of the Defence Staff says the
conflict "could last 50 years".

The irresponsibility of this is breathtaking; the pressure on Pakistan
alone could ignite an unprecedented crisis across the Indian
sub-continent. Having reported many wars, I am always struck by the
absurdity of effete politicians eager to wave farewell to young soldiers,
but who themselves would not say boo to a Taliban goose.

In the days of gunboats, our imperial leaders covered their violence in
the "morality" of their actions. Blair is no different. Like them, his
selective moralising omits the most basic truth. Nothing justified the
killing of innocent people in America on September 11, and nothing
justifies the killing of innocent people anywhere else.

By killing innocents in Afghanistan, Blair and Bush stoop to the level of
the criminal outrage in New York. Once you cluster bomb, "mistakes" and
"blunders" are a pretence. Murder is murder, regardless of whether you
crash a plane into a building or order and collude with it from the Oval
Office and Downing Street.

If Blair was really opposed to all forms of terrorism, he would get
Britain out of the arms trade. On the day of the twin towers attack, an
"arms fair", selling weapons of terror (like cluster bombs and missiles)
to assorted tyrants and human rights abusers, opened in London's Docklands
with the full backing of the Blair government.

If he really wanted to demonstrate "the moral fibre of Britain", Blair
would do everything in his power to lift the threat of violence in those
parts of the world where there is great and justifiable grievance and
anger.

He would do more than make gestures; he would demand that Israel ends its
illegal occupation of Palestine and withdraw to its borders prior to the
1967 war, as ordered by the Security Council, of which Britain is a
permanent member.

He would call for an end to the genocidal blockade which the UN - in
reality, America and Britain - has imposed on the suffering people of Iraq
for more than a decade, causing the deaths of half a million children
under the age of five.

That's more deaths of infants every month than the number killed in the
World Trade Center.

There are signs that Washington is about to extend its current "war" to
Iraq; yet unknown to most of us, almost every day RAF and American
aircraft already bomb Iraq. There are no headlines. There is nothing on
the TV news. This terror is the longest-running Anglo-American bombing
campaign since World War Two.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and Britain faced a "dilemma"
in Iraq, because "few targets remain". "We're down to the last outhouse,"
said a US official. That was two years ago, and they're still bombing. The
cost to the British taxpayer? 800 million pounds so far.

According to an internal UN report, covering a five-month period, 41 per
cent of the casualties are civilians. In northern Iraq, I met a woman
whose husband and four children were among the deaths listed in the
report. He was a shepherd, who was tending his sheep with his elderly
father and his children when two planes attacked them, each making a
sweep. It was an open valley; there were no military targets nearby.

"I want to see the pilot who did this," said the widow at the graveside of
her entire family. For them, there was no service in St Paul's Cathedral
with the Queen in attendance; no rock concert with Paul McCartney.

The tragedy of the Iraqis, and the Palestinians, and the Afghanis is a
truth that is the very opposite of their caricatures in much of the
Western media.

Far from being the terrorists of the world, the overwhelming majority of
the Islamic peoples of the Middle East and south Asia have been its
victims - victims largely of the West's exploitation of precious natural
resources in or near their countries.

There is no war on terrorism. If there was, the Royal Marines and the SAS
would be storming the beaches of Florida, where more CIA-funded
terrorists, ex-Latin American dictators and torturers, are given refuge
than anywhere on earth. . .

Now damn it, don't confuse the criticism with facts, that puts people off.
Better that one should be able to project and phantasize without having to be
bothered by the facts.  One should ignore the fact, for example, that there
is no porno industry in Afghanistan, or anything positive about it -- focus
entirely on the negative Western take  -- no health care, for crying out
loud.  Those dirty bastards, they're just not like us!  What a laugh --

of course, who trot on down to their HMOs on a daily basis....

vis a vis the Taliban and Women ... not so.   Western and Middle Eastern
feminists and human rights activists have been campaigning on behalf of women
in Afghanistan for years ... for instance, hundreds of email petitions have
circulated around the world -- the first I received was forwarded by a dear
male friend of mine in the UK ... long before most of us knew very much about
what was going on in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan didn't figure much on anyone's
international map at that time.  The irony is that it took what it did to get
the West interested in women's rights in Afghanistan.

Those are the facts.  Are people being manipulated by other information?
Most likely, most definitely, they are.  But no one is inventing the
information about women.

The rally was scheduled to begin at 11, I show up at five to - three people
and a very large poster - Is this the rally? - I'm reassured, The left are
always late - so, with The late are always left dodging through my mind, I
do my usual impression of a shag on a rock as the rest of the protesters
arrive. When the police show up - eight of them in yellow raincoats - it
occurs to me to count our little group - 26, although I may have missed the
odd kid or two. The NSW Police are not always so friendly to demonstrators
but the one who approaches us jokes about the weather and wishes us good
luck.

Setting off, I have my placard which I was very tempted to leave at home
(I've never carried a placard before but when one of my kids at school heard
I was going to the rally and didn't have one, he promptly volunteered to
make one for me - I don't know if it was a conscious decision, but it's
written in the colours of the Aboriginal flag), I was pretty sure I wasn't
going to chant anything but I did. I only wish that the activist with the
megaphone hadn't given the 1 2 3 4 We don't want your racist war - an
American accent and the rhythm one associates with the military (it may have
been a statement but it sounded wrong).

Apparently, this was the first anti-war march ever held in Springwood and it
was so strange to march down the main street where I usually shop, thinking
of the war, feeling close to tears for reasons I won't analyse, feeling more
strongly than I have ever felt before that this is what it means to be a
citizen in a democracy.

A number of people tooted their horns in support, a young man yelled - Up
with the Taliban - and an elderly woman gave us the finger. Afterwards, I
did the shopping. It's just beginning.

Dear Robert Corbett,
The "regimes" you talk about aren't merely
"anti-feminist" - they seem to me, from a liberal
secular position, to be anti-women.

Robert. that "cui bono"  good somthing? Sounds very menacing! I'm not anti
feminist even if you wern't implying that: I dont know a huge lot about the
Taleban but I agree with the point that the time now is not to discuss the
relative "evils" of various governments. I think that ultimately,when the
world is more unified, and less "heirachical" (everywhere in the world) we
can look (truly collectively) at fundamental questions: of course all
nations need to move away from absolutism, tryrannies, exploitation: but
that means all of us - together. All the working people: I am probably a
communist except I dont like labels. As to specifically Afgahanistan I
signed the petition immediatley when I read about the abuse of women's
rights there (but ther was some confusion about that petition).
  Nor would I stay in a "relatavist shrug" but I think we still have to work
very very diplomatically with other nations resapecting their ways: any
change we must bring about with humility...the Muslims have things we can
learn from... ok forget the Taleban (as we are theoretically (really?) at
war with them): take the "ordinary" Muslims (most of whom are no more
fanatical than very devout Christians and we must tolerate them - my  sister
is one (a Christian) and I dont agree with her but I dont hate her, of
course). As to the Taleban: lets find  out as much as we can about
them....but I dont want to fall into some sort of McCarthyist-Nixonic trap
here...
  Look: the situation for people (and in particular women), is not good
throughout the world, and the complete liberation of all people and the
establishment of a REAL democracy throughout the world is a vast and noble
aim: maybe our long term survival depends on it.  My opposition to an attack
on Afgahnistan is that war breeds war: it wont help the women (or any one)
over there.
 President Bush: please turn your ships around. Negaotiate with Bin Laden
 go through Wassim Akram as an ambassador: that  great cricketer and thinker
and gentle man of culture) and the Palestinians and others... talk to all
the Arab and other Muslim peoples.  Make certain that evryone in the world
is involved and gives the go ahead to any apposite action: wars no longer
solve things. War by the US (even if the US WAS attacked unjustly) will lead
to unwanted deaths of Americans and people of many other nations. Vengeance
is stupid: it wont help those tragically killed on September the Eleventh.
The fundamental issues can only be worked through by negotian argument and
discussion and maybe concessions by both "sides"  (or all "sides")... I
believe that Clinton, with his faults, was working more in this way.
President Bush your most courageous person in the US is the woman who voted
constitutionally against commiting funds and will to this war. Stop and
think.
   If you think you can wipe out terrorism in this way: think again. I can
(not that I would ever except perhaps in extremis extremis!!) fill my boot
with petrol and drive my car into a busy and crowded street: there are
millions of ways to cause terror...the human mind and hands can either
"murder or create".(from T S Eliot).  Stop the bombing and the war rhetoric
and enter into negotiations involving everyone at every level in every
country on the earth. Try to love (and understand) thine enemy. Richard.

It may be a shock but I have studied Marxism and I reject it totally. Class
does not exist it  is something created by those who want to justify their
academic opinions. In the end in all Marxist analysis someone ends up on the
outs.  All politics is organic
it originates from the conditions in the region where it is born

Dear Anastasios Kozaitis, Dear David Antin, and Dear List,

I am not a visionary.  I am a plodding, low to the ground, philologist.  I am
seriously near-sighted,and whatever imagination is available to me I use to
imagine things that happened, oh, some four or five thousand years ago, in
what is now known as India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran.  To put it in
academic terms, that is my area of expertise.

But my thoughts on the contemporary matters that preoccupy us now do not seem
to me to be reactionary.  Whereas David Antin and other ex-liberals choose to
play the game of Realpolitik, I prefer to cling to a Realethik.  That is my
alternative plan. It is not new.  It is not visionary.  But it is, I
fervently hope, ethical.

Anastasios, what would you have me do?  Imitate William Blake?  Allen
Ginsberg?  Well, they would make good models, to be sure, but I prefer to
tunnel down backward in time.  Maybe I'm more of an archaeologist than a
visionary. Was Olson both?  In any case, I know I'm not, and I don't mind.

Best,

GT

A MUST read, Chomsky's latest talk at MIT on terrorism.

A country that has perpetrated perhaps the most grievous world wide terror
over the past 50 years & then has the chutzpa to call someone else a
terrorist--one can only shake one's head in disbelief. Living as an
expatriate here in Taiwan for the past 23 years, when asked my nationality =
I
reply, Jewish, Buddhist, Nudist (in that rhythmical order).

The New War Against Terror AN EVENING WITH NOAM CHOMSKY

October 18, 2001 - Transcribed from audio recorded at The
Technology & Culture Forum at MIT The Talk (audio)



Everyone knows it=B9s the TV people who run the world [crowd
laugher]. I just got orders that I=B9m supposed to be here, not
there. Well the last talk I gave at this forum was on a light
pleasant topic. It was about how humans are an endangered species
and given the nature of their institutions they are likely to
destroy themselves in a fairly short time. So this time there is
a little relief and we have a pleasant topic instead, the new war
on terror. Unfortunately, the world keeps coming up with things
that make it more and more horrible as we proceed.



Assume 2 Conditions for this Talk

I=B9m going to assume 2 conditions for this talk.

The first one is just what I assume to be recognition of fact.
That is that the events of September 11 were a horrendous
atrocity probably the most devastating instant human toll of any
crime in history, outside of war. The second assumption has to do
with the goals. I=B9m assuming that our goal is that we are
interested in reducing the likelihood of such crimes whether they
are against us or against someone else. If you don=B9t accept those
two assumptions, then what I say will not be addressed to you. If
we do accept them, then a number of questions arise, closely
related ones, which merit a good deal of thought.


The 5 Questions

One question, and by far the most important one is what is
happening right now? Implicit in that is what can we do about it?
The 2nd has to do with the very common assumption that what
happened on September 11 is a historic event, one which will
change history. I tend to agree with that. I think it =B9s true. It
was a historic event and the question we should be asking is
exactly why? The 3rd question has to do with the title, The War
Against Terrorism. Exactly what is it? And there is a related
question, namely what is terrorism? The 4th question which is
narrower but important has to do with the origins of the crimes
of September 11th. And the 5th question that I want to talk a
little about is what policy options there are in fighting this
war against terrorism and dealing with the situations that led to
it.

I=B9ll say a few things about each.  Glad to go beyond in
discussion and don =B9t hesitate to bring up other questions. These
are ones that come to my mind as prominent but you may easily and
plausibly have other choices.



1. What=B9s Happening Right Now?

Starvation of 3 to 4 Million People

Well let=B9s start with right now. I=B9ll talk about the situation in
Afghanistan. I=B9ll just keep to uncontroversial sources like the
New York Times [crowd laughter]. According to the New York Times
there are 7 to 8 million people in Afghanistan on the verge of
starvation. That was true actually before September 11th. They
were surviving on international aid. On September 16th, the Times
reported, I=B9m quoting it, that the United States demanded from
Pakistan the elimination of truck convoys that provide much of
the food and other supplies to Afghanistan=B9s civilian population.
As far as I could determine there was no reaction in the United
States or for that matter in Europe. I was on national radio all
over Europe the next day. There was no reaction in the United
States or in Europe to my knowledge to the demand to impose
massive starvation on millions of people. The threat of military
strikes right after September=8A..around that time forced the
removal of international aid workers that crippled the assistance
programs. Actually, I am quoting again from the New York Times.
Refugees reaching Pakistan after arduous journeys from AF are
describing scenes of desperation and fear at home as the threat
of American led military attacks turns their long running misery
into a potential catastrophe. The country was on a lifeline and
we just cut the line. Quoting an evacuated aid worker, in the New
York Times Magazine.

The World Food Program, the UN program, which is the main one by
far, were able to resume after 3 weeks in early October, they
began to resume at a lower level, resume food shipments. They
don=B9t have international aid workers within, so the distribution
system is hampered. That was suspended as soon as the bombing
began. They then resumed but at a lower pace while aid agencies
leveled scathing condemnations of US airdrops, condemning them as
propaganda tools which are probably doing more harm than good.
That happens to be quoting the London Financial Times but it is
easy to continue. After the first week of bombing, the New York
Times reported on a back page inside a column on something else,
that by the arithmetic of the United Nations there will soon be
7.5 million Afghans in acute need of even a loaf of bread and
there are only a few weeks left before the harsh winter will make
deliveries to many areas totally impossible, continuing to quote,
but with bombs falling the delivery rate is down to &frac12; of
what is needed. Casual comment. Which tells us that Western
civilization is anticipating the slaughter of, well do the
arithmetic, 3-4 million people or something like that. On the
same day, the leader of Western civilization dismissed with
contempt, once again, offers of negotiation for delivery of the
alleged target, Osama bin Laden, and a request for some evidence
to substantiate the demand for total capitulation. It was
dismissed. On the same day the Special Rapporteur of the UN in
charge of food pleaded with the United States to stop the bombing
to try to save millions of victims. As far as I=B9m aware that was
unreported. That was Monday. Yesterday the major aid agencies
OXFAM and Christian Aid and others joined in that plea. You can=B9t
find a report in the New York Times. There was a line in the
Boston Globe, hidden in a story about another topic, Kashmir.

Silent Genocide

Well we could easily go on=8A.but all of that=8A.first of all
indicates to us what=B9s happening. Looks like what=B9s happening is
some sort of silent genocide. It also gives a good deal of
insight into the elite culture, the culture that we are part of.
It indicates that whatever, what will happen we don=B9t know, but
plans are being made and programs implemented on the assumption
that they may lead to the death of several million people in the
next few months=8A.very casually with no comment, no particular
thought about it, that=B9s just kind of normal, here and in a good
part of Europe. Not in the rest of the world. In fact not even in
much of Europe. So if you read the Irish press or the press in
Scotland=8Athat close, reactions are very different. Well that=B9s
what=B9s happening now. What=B9s happening now is very much under our
control. We can do a lot to affect what=B9s happening. And that=B9s
roughly it.



2. Why was it a Historic Event?

National Territory Attacked

Alright let=B9s turn to the slightly more abstract question,
forgetting for the moment that we are in the midst of apparently
trying to murder 3 or 4 million people, not Taliban of course,
their victims. Let=B9s go back=8Aturn to the question of the historic
event that took place on September 11th. As I said, I think
that=B9s correct. It was a historic event. Not unfortunately
because of its scale, unpleasant to think about, but in terms of
the scale it=B9s not that unusual. I did say it=B9s the
worst=8Aprobably the worst instant human toll of any crime. And
that may be true. But there are terrorist crimes with effects a
bit more drawn out that are more extreme, unfortunately.
Nevertheless, it=B9s a historic event because there was a change.
The change was the direction in which the guns were pointed.
That=B9 s new. Radically new. So, take US history.

The last time that the national territory of the United States
was under attack, or for that matter, even threatened was when
the British burned down Washington in 1814. There have been
many=8Ait was common to bring up Pearl Harbor but that=B9s not a good
analogy. The Japanese, what ever you think about it, the Japanese
bombed military bases in 2 US colonies not the national
territory; colonies which had been taken from their inhabitants
in not a very pretty way. This is the national territory that=B9s
been attacked on a large scale, you can find a few fringe
examples but this is unique.

During these close to 200 years, we, the United States expelled
or mostly exterminated the indigenous population, that=B9s many
millions of people, conquered half of Mexico, carried out
depredations all over the region, Caribbean and Central America,
sometimes beyond, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines, killing
several 100,000 Filipinos in the process. Since the Second World
War, it has extended its reach around the world in ways I don=B9 t
have to describe. But it was always killing someone else, the
fighting was somewhere else, it was others who were getting
slaughtered. Not here. Not the national territory.

Europe

In the case of Europe, the change is even more dramatic because
its history is even more horrendous than ours. We are an offshoot
of Europe, basically. For hundreds of years, Europe has been
casually slaughtering people all

over the world. That=B9s how they conquered the world, not by
handing out candy to babies. During this period, Europe did
suffer murderous wars, but that was European killers murdering
one another. The main sport of Europe for hundreds of years was
slaughtering one another. The only reason that it came to an end
in 1945, was=8A.it had nothing to do with Democracy or not making
war with each other and other fashionable notions. It had to do
with the fact that everyone understood that the next time they
play the game it was going to be the end for the world. Because
the Europeans, including us, had developed such massive weapons
of destruction that that game just have to be over. And it goes
back hundreds of years. In the 17th century, about probably 40%
of the entire population of Germany was wiped out in one war.

But during this whole bloody murderous period, it was Europeans
slaughtering each other, and Europeans slaughtering people
elsewhere. The Congo didn=B9t attack Belgium, India didn=B9t attack
England, Algeria didn =B9t attack France. It=B9s uniform. There are
again small exceptions, but pretty small in scale, certainly
invisible in the scale of what Europe and us were doing to the
rest of the world. This is the first change. The first time that
the guns have been pointed the other way. And in my opinion
that=B9s probably why you see such different reactions on the two
sides of the Irish Sea which I have noticed, incidentally, in
many interviews on both sides, national radio on both sides. The
world looks very different depending on whether you are holding
the lash or whether you are being whipped by it for hundreds of
years, very different. So I think the shock and surprise in
Europe and its offshoots, like here, is very understandable. It
is a historic event but regrettably not in scale, in something
else and a reason why the rest of the world=8Amost of the rest of
the world looks at it quite differently. Not lacking sympathy for
the victims of the atrocity or being horrified by them, that=B9s
almost uniform, but viewing it from a different perspective.
Something we might want to understand.



3. What is the War Against Terrorism?

Well, let=B9s go to the third question, =8CWhat is the war against
terrorism? =B9 and a side question, =8CWhat=B9s terrorism?=B9. The war
against terrorism has been described in high places as a struggle
against a plague, a cancer which is spread by barbarians, by
=B3depraved opponents of civilization itself.=B2 That=B9s a feeling
that I share. The words I=B9m quoting, however, happen to be from
20 years ago. Those are=8Athat=B9s President Reagan and his Secretary
of State. The Reagan administration came into office 20 years ago
declaring that the war against international terrorism would be
the core of our foreign policy=8A.describing it in terms of the
kind I just mentioned and others. And it was the core of our
foreign policy. The Reagan administration responded to this
plague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself by
creating an extraordinary international terrorist network,
totally unprecedented in scale, which carried out massive
atrocities all over the world, primarily=8A.well, partly nearby,
but not only there. I won=B9t run through the record, you=B9re all
educated people, so I=B9m sure you learned about it in High School.
[crowd laughter]

Reagan-US War Against Nicaragua

But I=B9ll just mention one case which is totally uncontroversial,
so we might as well not argue about it, by no means the most
extreme but uncontroversial. It=B9s uncontroversial because of the
judgments of the highest international authorities the
International Court of Justice, the World Court, and the UN
Security Council. So this one is uncontroversial, at least among
people who have some minimal concern for international law, human
rights, justice and other things like that. And now I=B9ll leave
you an exercise. You can estimate the size of that category by
simply asking how often this uncontroversial case has been
mentioned in the commentary of the last month. And it=B9s a
particularly relevant one, not only because it is
uncontroversial, but because it does offer a precedent as to how
a law abiding state would respond to=8Adid respond in fact to
international terrorism, which is uncontroversial. And was even
more extreme than the events of September 11th. I=B9m talking about
the Reagan-US war against Nicaragua which left tens of thousands
of people dead, the country ruined, perhaps beyond recovery.

Nicaragua=B9s Response

Nicaragua did respond. They didn=B9t respond by setting off bombs
in Washington. They responded by taking it to the World Court,
presenting a case, they had no problem putting together evidence.
The World Court accepted their case, ruled in their favor,
ordered the=8Acondemned what they called the =B3unlawful use of
force,=B2 which is another word for international terrorism, by the
United States, ordered the United States to terminate the crime
and to pay massive reparations. The United States, of course,
dismissed the court judgment with total contempt and announced
that it would not accept the jurisdiction of the court
henceforth. Then Nicaragua then went to the UN Security Council
which considered a resolution calling on all states to observe
international law. No one was mentioned but everyone understood.
The United States vetoed the resolution. It now stands as the
only state on record which has both been condemned by the World
Court for international terrorism and has vetoed a Security
Council resolution calling on states to observe international
law. Nicaragua then went to the General Assembly where there is
technically no veto but a negative US vote amounts to a veto. It
passed a similar resolution with only the United States, Israel,
and El Salvador opposed. The following year again, this time the
United States could only rally Israel to the cause, so 2 votes
opposed to observing international law. At that point, Nicaragua
couldn=B9t do anything lawful. It tried all the measures. They
don=B9t work in a world that is ruled by force.

This case is uncontroversial but it=B9s by no means the most
extreme. We gain a lot of insight into our own culture and
society and what=B9s happening now by asking =8Chow much we know
about all this? How much we talk about it? How much you learn
about it in school? How much it=B9s all over the front pages?=B9 And
this is only the beginning. The United States responded to the
World Court and the Security Council by immediately escalating
the war very quickly, that was a bipartisan decision
incidentally. The terms of the war were also changed. For the
first time there were official orders given=8Aofficial orders to
the terrorist army to attack what are called =B3soft targets,=B2
meaning undefended civilian targets, and to keep away from the
Nicaraguan army. They were able to do that because the United
States had total control of the air over Nicaragua and the
mercenary army was supplied with advanced communication
equipment, it wasn=B9t a guerilla army in the normal sense and
could get instructions about the disposition of the Nicaraguan
army forces so they could attack agricultural collectives, health
clinics, and so on=8Asoft targets with impunity. Those were the
official orders.

What was the Reaction Here?

What was the reaction? It was known. There was a reaction to it.
The policy was regarded as sensible by left liberal opinion. So
Michael Kinsley who represents the left in mainstream discussion,
wrote an article in which he said that we shouldn=B9t be too quick
to criticize this policy as Human Rights Watch had just done. He
said a =B3sensible policy=B2 must =B3meet the test of cost benefit
analysis=B2 -- that is, I=B9m quoting now, that is the analysis of
=B3the amount of blood and misery that will be poured in, and the
likelihood that democracy will emerge at the other end.=B2
Democracy as the US understands the term, which is graphically
illustrated in the surrounding countries. Notice that it is
axiomatic that the United States, US elites, have the right to
conduct the analysis and to pursue the project if it passes their
tests. And it did pass their tests. It worked. When Nicaragua
finally succumbed to superpower assault, commentators openly and
cheerfully lauded the success of the methods that were adopted
and described them accurately. So I=B9ll quote Time Magazine just
to pick one. They lauded the success of the methods adopted: =B3to
wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war until
the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government
themselves,=B2 with a cost to us that is =B3minimal,=B2 and leaving the
victims =B3with wrecked bridges, sabotaged power stations, and
ruined farms,=B2 and thus providing the US candidate with a
=B3winning issue=B2: =B3ending the impoverishment of the people of
Nicaragua.=B2 The New York Times had a headline saying =B3Americans
United in Joy=B2 at this outcome.

Terrorism Works =AD Terrorism is not the Weapon of the Weak

That is the culture in which we live and it reveals several
facts. One is the fact that terrorism works. It doesn=B9t fail. It
works. Violence usually works. That=B9s world history. Secondly,
it=B9s a very serious analytic error to say, as is commonly done,
that terrorism is the weapon of the weak. Like other means of
violence, it=B9s primarily a weapon of the strong, overwhelmingly,
in fact. It is held to be a weapon of the weak because the strong
also control the doctrinal systems and their terror doesn=B9t count
as terror. Now that=B9s close to universal. I can=B9t think of a
historical exception, even the worst mass murderers view the
world that way. So pick the Nazis. They weren=B9t carrying out
terror in occupied Europe. They were protecting the local
population from the terrorisms of the partisans. And like other
resistance movements, there was terrorism. The Nazis were
carrying out counter terror. Furthermore, the United States
essentially agreed with that. After the war, the US army did
extensive studies of Nazi counter terror operations in Europe.
First I should say that the US picked them up and began carrying
them out itself, often against the same targets, the former
resistance. But the military also studied the Nazi methods
published interesting studies, sometimes critical of them because
they were inefficiently carried out, so a critical analysis, you
didn=B9t do this right, you did that right, but those methods with
the advice of Wermacht officers who were brought over here became
the manuals of counter insurgency, of counter terror, of low
intensity conflict, as it is called, and are the manuals, and are
the procedures that are being used. So it=B9 s not just that the
Nazis did it. It=B9s that it was regarded as the right thing to do
by the leaders of western civilization, that is us, who then
proceeded to do it themselves. Terrorism is not the weapon of the
weak. It is the weapon of those who are against =8Cus=B9 whoever =8Cus=B9
happens to be. And if you can find a historical exception to
that, I=B9d be interested in seeing it.

Nature of our Culture =AD How We Regard Terrorism

Well, an interesting indication of the nature of our culture, our
high culture, is the way in which all of this is regarded. One
way it=B9s regarded is just suppressing it. So almost nobody has
ever heard of it. And the power of American propaganda and
doctrine is so strong that even among the victims it=B9s barely
known. I mean, when you talk about this to people in Argentina,
you have to remind them. Oh, yeh, that happened, we forgot about
it. It=B9s deeply suppressed. The sheer consequences of the
monopoly of violence can be very powerful in ideological and
other terms.

The Idea that Nicaragua Might Have The Right To Defend Itself

Well, one illuminating aspect of our own attitude toward
terrorism is the reaction to the idea that Nicaragua might have
the right to defend itself. Actually I went through this in some
detail with database searches and that sort of thing. The idea
that Nicaragua might have the right to defend itself was
considered outrageous. There is virtually nothing in mainstream
commentary indicating that Nicaragua might have that right. And
that fact was exploited by the Reagan administration and its
propaganda in an interesting way. Those of you who were around in
that time will remember that they periodically floated rumors
that the Nicaraguans were getting MIG jets, jets from Russia. At
that point the hawks and the doves split. The hawks said, =8Cok,
let=B9s bomb =8Cem.=B9 The doves said, `wait a minute, let=B9 s see if
the rumors are true. And if the rumors are true, then let=B9s bomb
them. Because they are a threat to the United States.=B9 Why,
incidentally were they getting MIGs. Well they tried to get jet
planes from European countries but the United States put pressure
on its allies so that it wouldn =B9t send them means of defense
because they wanted them to turn to the Russians. That=B9s good for
propaganda purposes. Then they become a threat to us. Remember,
they were just 2 days march from Harlingen, Texas. We actually
declared a national emergency in 1985 to protect the country from
the threat of Nicaragua. And it stayed in force. So it was much
better for them to get arms from the Russians. Why would they
want jet planes? Well, for the reasons I already mentioned. The
United States had total control over their airspace, was over
flying it and using that to provide instructions to the terrorist
army to enable them to attack soft targets without running into
the army that might defend them. Everyone knew that that was the
reason. They are not going to use their jet planes for anything
else. But the idea that Nicaragua should be permitted to defend
its airspace against a superpower attack that is directing
terrorist forces to attack undefended civilian targets, that was
considered in the United States as outrageous and uniformly so.
Exceptions are so slight, you know I can practically list them. I
don=B9t suggest that you take my word for this. Have a look. That
includes our own senators, incidentally.

Honduras =AD The Appointment of John Negroponte as Ambassador to
the United Nations

Another illustration of how we regard terrorism is happening
right now. The US has just appointed an ambassador to the United
Nations to lead the war against terrorism a couple weeks ago. Who
is he? Well, his name is John Negroponte. He was the US
ambassador in the fiefdom, which is what it is, of Honduras in
the early 1980=B9s. There was a little fuss made about the fact
that he must have been aware, as he certainly was, of the
large-scale murders and other atrocities that were being carried
out by the security forces in Honduras that we were supporting.
But that=B9s a small part of it. As proconsul of Honduras, as he
was called there, he was the local supervisor for the terrorist
war based in Honduras, for which his government was condemned by
the world court and then the Security Council in a vetoed
resolution. And he was just appointed as the UN Ambassador to
lead the war against terror. Another small experiment you can do
is check and see what the reaction was to this. Well, I will tell
you what you are going to find, but find it for yourself. Now
that tells us a lot about the war against terrorism and a lot
about ourselves.

After the United States took over the country again under the
conditions that were so graphically described by the press, the
country was pretty much destroyed in the 1980=B9s, but it has
totally collapsed since in every respect just about. Economically
it has declined sharply since the US take over, democratically
and in every other respect. It=B9s now the second poorest country
in the Hemisphere. I should say=8A.I=B9m not going to talk about it,
but I mentioned that I picked up Nicaragua because it is an
uncontroversial case. If you look at the other states in the
region, the state terror was far more extreme and it again traces
back to Washington and that=B9s by no means all.

US & UK Backed South African Attacks

It was happening elsewhere in the world too, take say Africa.
During the Reagan years alone, South African attacks, backed by
the United States and Britain, US/UK-backed South African attacks
against the neighboring countries killed about a million and a
half people and left 60 billion dollars in damage and countries
destroyed.  And if we go around the world, we can add more
examples.

Now that was the first war against terror of which I=B9ve given a
small sample. Are we supposed to pay attention to that? Or kind
of think that that might be relevant? After all it=B9s not exactly
ancient history. Well, evidently not as you can tell by looking
at the current discussion of the war on terror which has been the
leading topic for the last month.

Haiti, Guatemala, and Nicaragua

I mentioned that Nicaragua has now become the 2nd poorest country
in the hemisphere. What=B9s the poorest country? Well that=B9s of
course Haiti which also happens to be the victim of most US
intervention in the 20th century by a long shot. We left it
totally devastated. It=B9s the poorest country. Nicaragua is second
ranked in degree of US intervention in the 20th century. It is
the 2nd poorest. Actually, it is vying with Guatemala. They
interchange every year or two as to who=B9s the second poorest. And
they also vie as to who is the leading target of US military
intervention. We =B9 re supposed to think that all of this is some
sort of accident. That is has nothing to do with anything that
happened in history. Maybe.

Colombia and Turkey

The worst human rights violator in the 1990=B9s is Colombia, by a
long shot. It=B9s also the, by far, the leading recipient of US
military aid in the 1990 =B9s maintaining the terror and human
rights violations. In 1999, Colombia replaced Turkey as the
leading recipient of US arms worldwide, that is excluding Israel
and Egypt which are a separate category. And that tells us a lot
more about the war on terror right now, in fact.

Why was Turkey getting such a huge flow of US arms? Well if you
take a look at the flow of US arms to Turkey, Turkey always got a
lot of US arms. It =B9s strategically placed, a member of NATO, and
so on. But the arms flow to Turkey went up very sharply in 1984.
It didn=B9t have anything to do with the cold war. I mean Russian
was collapsing. And it stayed high from 1984 to 1999 when it
reduced and it was replaced in the lead by Colombia. What
happened from 1984 to 1999? Well, in 1984, [Turkey] launched a
major terrorist war against Kurds in southeastern Turkey. And
that=B9s when US aid went up, military aid. And this was not
pistols. This was jet planes, tanks, military training, and so
on. And it stayed high as the atrocities escalated through the
1990=B9s. Aid followed it. The peak year was 1997. In 1997, US
military aid to Turkey was more than in the entire period 1950 to
1983, that is the cold war period, which is an indication of how
much the cold war has affected policy. And the results were
awesome. This led to 2-3 million refugees. Some of the worst
ethnic cleansing of the late 1990=B9 s. Tens of thousands of people
killed, 3500 towns and villages destroyed, way more than Kosovo,
even under NATO bombs. And the United States was providing 80% of
the arms, increasing as the atrocities increased, peaking in
1997. It declined in 1999 because, once again, terror worked as
it usually does when carried out by its major agents, mainly the
powerful. So by 1999, Turkish terror, called of course
counter-terror, but as I said, that=B9s universal, it worked.
Therefore Turkey was replaced by Colombia which had not yet
succeeded in its terrorist war. And therefore had to move into
first place as recipient of US arms.

Self Congratulation on the Part of Western Intellectuals

Well, what makes this all particularly striking is that all of
this was taking place right in the midst of a huge flood of
self-congratulation on the part of Western intellectuals which
probably has no counterpart in history. I mean you all remember
it. It was just a couple years ago. Massive self-adulation about
how for the first time in history we are so magnificent; that we
are standing up for principles and values; dedicated to ending
inhumanity everywhere in the new era of this-and-that, and
so-on-and-so-forth. And we certainly can=B9t tolerate atrocities
right near the borders of NATO. That was repeated over and over.
Only within the borders of NATO where we can not only can
tolerate much worse atrocities but contribute to them. Another
insight into Western civilization and our own, is how often was
this brought up? Try to look. I won=B9t repeat it. But it=B9s
instructive. It=B9s a pretty impressive feat for a propaganda
system to carry this off in a free society. It=B9s pretty amazing.
I don=B9t think you could do this in a totalitarian state.

Turkey is Very Grateful

And Turkey is very grateful. Just a few days ago, Prime Minister
Ecevit announced that Turkey would join the coalition against
terror, very enthusiastically, even more so than others. In fact,
he said they would contribute troops which others have not
willing to do. And he explained why. He said, We owe a debt of
gratitude to the United States because the United States was the
only country that was willing to contribute so massively to our
own, in his words =B3counter-terrorist=B2 war, that is to our own
massive ethnic cleansing and atrocities and terror. Other
countries helped a little, but they stayed back. The United
States, on the other hand, contributed enthusiastically and
decisively and was able to do so because of the silence,
servility might be the right word, of the educated classes who
could easily find out about it. It=B9s a free country after all.
You can read human rights reports. You can read all sorts of
stuff. But we chose to contribute to the atrocities and Turkey is
very happy, they owe us a debt of gratitude for that and
therefore will contribute troops just as during the war in
Serbia. Turkey was very much praised for using its F-16=B9 s which
we supplied it to bomb Serbia exactly as it had been doing with
the same planes against its own population up until the time when
it finally succeeded in crushing internal terror as they called
it. And as usual, as always, resistance does include terror. Its
true of the American Revolution. That=B9s true of every case I
know. Just as its true that those who have a monopoly of violence
talk about themselves as carrying out counter terror.

The Coalition =AD Including Algeria, Russia, China, Indonesia

Now that=B9s pretty impressive and that has to do with the
coalition that is now being organized to fight the war against
terror. And it=B9s very interesting to see how that coalition is
being described. So have a look at this morning=B9s Christian
Science Monitor. That=B9s a good newspaper. One of the best
international newspapers, with real coverage of the world. The
lead story, the front-page story, is about how the United States,
you know people used to dislike the United States but now they
are beginning to respect it, and they are very happy about the
way that the US is leading the war against terror. And the prime
example, well in fact the only serious example, the others are a
joke, is Algeria. Turns out that Algeria is very enthusiastic
about the US war against terror. The person who wrote the article
is an expert on Africa. He must know that Algeria is one of the
most vicious terrorist states in the world and has been carrying
out horrendous terror against its own population in the past
couple of years, in fact. For a while, this was under wraps. But
it was finally exposed in France by defectors from the Algerian
army. It=B9s all over the place there and in England and so on. But
here, we=B9re very proud because one of the worst terrorist states
in the world is now enthusiastically welcoming the US war on
terror and in fact is cheering on the United States to lead the
war. That shows how popular we are getting.

And if you look at the coalition that is being formed against
terror it tells you a lot more. A leading member of the coalition
is Russia which is delighted to have the United States support
its murderous terrorist war in Chechnya instead of occasionally
criticizing it in the background. China is joining
enthusiastically. It=B9s delighted to have support for the
atrocities it=B9s carrying out in western China against, what it
called, Muslim secessionists. Turkey, as I mentioned, is very
happy with the war against terror. They are experts. Algeria,
Indonesia delighted to have even more US support for atrocities
it is carrying out in Ache and elsewhere. Now we can run through
the list, the list of the states that have joined the coalition
against terror is quite impressive. They have a characteristic in
common. They are certainly among the leading terrorist states in
the world. And they happen to be led by the world champion.

What is Terrorism?

Well that brings us back to the question, what is terrorism? I
have been assuming we understand it. Well, what is it? Well,
there happen to be some easy answers to this. There is an
official definition. You can find it in the US code or in US army
manuals. A brief statement of it taken from a US army manual, is
fair enough, is that terror is the calculated use of violence or
the threat of violence to attain political or religious
ideological goals through intimidation, coercion, or instilling
fear. That=B9 s terrorism. That=B9s a fair enough definition. I think
it is reasonable to accept that. The problem is that it can=B9t be
accepted because if you accept that, all the wrong consequences
follow. For example, all the consequences I have just been
reviewing. Now there is a major effort right now at the UN to try
to develop a comprehensive treaty on terrorism. When Kofi Annan
got the Nobel prize the other day, you will notice he was
reported as saying that we should stop wasting time on this and
really get down to it.

But there=B9s a problem. If you use the official definition of
terrorism in the comprehensive treaty you are going to get
completely the wrong results. So that can=B9t be done. In fact, it
is even worse than that. If you take a look at the definition of
Low Intensity Warfare which is official US policy you find that
it is a very close paraphrase of what I just read. In fact, Low
Intensity Conflict is just another name for terrorism. That=B9s why
all countries, as far as I know, call whatever horrendous acts
they are carrying out, counter terrorism. We happen to call it
Counter Insurgency or Low Intensity Conflict. So that=B9s a serious
problem. You can=B9t use the actual definitions. You=B9ve got to
carefully find a definition that doesn=B9 t have all the wrong
consequences.

Why did the United States and Israel Vote Against a Major
Resolution Condemning Terrorism?

There are some other problems. Some of them came up in December
1987, at the peak of the first war on terrorism, that=B9s when the
furor over the plague was peaking. The United Nations General
Assembly passed a very strong resolution against terrorism,
condemning the plague in the strongest terms, calling on every
state to fight against it in every possible way. It passed
unanimously. One country, Honduras abstained. Two votes against;
the usual two, United States and Israel. Why should the United
States and Israel vote against a major resolution condemning
terrorism in the strongest terms, in fact pretty much the terms
that the Reagan administration was using? Well, there is a
reason. There is one paragraph in that long resolution which says
that nothing in this resolution infringes on the rights of people
struggling against racist and colonialist regimes or foreign
military occupation to continue with their resistance with the
assistance of others, other states, states outside in their just
cause. Well, the United States and Israel can=B9t accept that. The
main reason that they couldn=B9t at the time was because of South
Africa. South Africa was an ally, officially called an ally.
There was a terrorist force in South Africa. It was called the
African National Congress. They were a terrorist force
officially. South Africa in contrast was an ally and we certainly
couldn=B9t support actions by a terrorist group struggling against
a racist regime. That would be impossible.

And of course there is another one. Namely the Israeli occupied
territories, now going into its 35th year. Supported primarily by
the United States in blocking a diplomatic settlement for 30
years now, still is. And you can=B9t have that. There is another
one at the time. Israel was occupying Southern Lebanon and was
being combated by what the US calls a terrorist force, Hizbullah,
which in fact succeeded in driving Israel out of Lebanon. And we
can=B9t allow anyone to struggle against a military occupation when
it is one that we support so therefore the US and Israel had to
vote against the major UN resolution on terrorism. And I
mentioned before that a US vote against=8Ais essentially a veto.
Which is only half the story. It also vetoes it from history. So
none of this was every reported and none of it appeared in the
annals of terrorism. If you look at the scholarly work on
terrorism and so on, nothing that I just mentioned appears. The
reason is that it has got the wrong people holding the guns. You
have to carefully hone the definitions and the scholarship and so
on so that you come out with the right conclusions; otherwise it
is not respectable scholarship and honorable journalism. Well,
these are some of problems that are hampering the effort to
develop a comprehensive treaty against terrorism. Maybe we should
have an academic conference or something to try to see if we can
figure out a way of defining terrorism so that it comes out with
just the right answers, not the wrong answers. That won=B9 t be
easy.



4. What are the Origins of the September 11 Crime?

Well, let=B9s drop that and turn to the 4th question, What are the
origins of the September 11 crimes? Here we have to make a
distinction between 2 categories which shouldn=B9t be run together.
One is the actual agents of the crime, the other is kind of a
reservoir of at least sympathy, sometimes support that they
appeal to even among people who very much oppose the criminals
and the actions. And those are 2 different things.

Category 1: The Likely Perpetrators

Well, with regard to the perpetrators, in a certain sense we are
not really clear. The United States either is unable or unwilling
to provide any evidence, any meaningful evidence. There was a
sort of a play a week or two ago when Tony Blair was set up to
try to present it. I don=B9t exactly know what the purpose of this
was. Maybe so that the US could look as though it=B9 s holding back
on some secret evidence that it can=B9t reveal or that Tony Blair
could strike proper Churchillian poses or something or other.
Whatever the PR [public relations] reasons were, he gave a
presentation which was in serious circles considered so absurd
that it was barely even mentioned. So the Wall Street Journal,
for example, one of the more serious papers had a small story on
page 12, I think, in which they pointed out that there was not
much evidence and then they quoted some high US official as
saying that it didn=B9t matter whether there was any evidence
because they were going to do it anyway. So why bother with the
evidence? The more ideological press, like the New York Times and
others, they had big front-page headlines. But the Wall Street
Journal reaction was reasonable and if you look at the so-called
evidence you can see why. But let=B9s assume that it=B9s true. It is
astonishing to me how weak the evidence was. I sort of thought
you could do better than that without any intelligence service
[audience laughter]. In fact, remember this was after weeks of
the most intensive investigation in history of all the
intelligence services of the western world working overtime
trying to put something together. And it was a prima facie, it
was a very strong case even before you had anything. And it ended
up about where it started, with a prima facie case. So let =B9s
assume that it is true. So let=B9s assume that, it looked obvious
the first day, still does, that the actual perpetrators come from
the radical Islamic, here called, fundamentalist networks of
which the bin Laden network is undoubtedly a significant part.
Whether they were involved or not nobody knows. It doesn=B9t really
matter much.

Where did they come from?

That=B9s the background, those networks. Well, where do they come
from? We know all about that. Nobody knows about that better than
the CIA because it helped organize them and it nurtured them for
a long time. They were brought together in the 1980=B9s actually by
the CIA and its associates elsewhere: Pakistan, Britain, France,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, China was involved, they may have been
involved a little bit earlier, maybe by 1978. The idea was to try
to harass the Russians, the common enemy. According to President
Carter=B9s National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the US
got involved in mid 1979. Do you remember, just to put the dates
right, that Russia invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. Ok.
According to Brzezinski, the US support for the mojahedin
fighting against the government began 6 months earlier. He is
very proud of that. He says we drew the Russians into, in his
words, an Afghan trap, by supporting the mojahedin, getting them
to invade, getting them into the trap. Now then we could develop
this terrific mercenary army. Not a small one, maybe 100,000 men
or so bringing together the best killers they could find, who
were radical Islamist fanatics from around North Africa, Saudi
Arabia=8A.anywhere they could find them. They were often called the
Afghanis but many of them, like bin Laden, were not Afghans. They
were brought by the CIA and its friends from elsewhere. Whether
Brzezinski is telling the truth or not, I don=B9t know. He may have
been bragging, he is apparently very proud of it, knowing the
consequences incidentally. But maybe it=B9s true. We=B9ll know
someday if the documents are ever released. Anyway, that=B9s his
perception. By January 1980 it is not even in doubt that the US
was organizing the Afghanis and this massive military force to
try to cause the Russians maximal trouble. It was a legitimate
thing for the Afghans to fight the Russian invasion. But the US
intervention was not helping the Afghans. In fact, it helped
destroy the country and much more. The Afghanis, so called, had
their own...it did force the Russians to withdrew, finally.
Although many analysts believe that it probably delayed their
withdrawal because they were trying to get out of it. Anyway,
whatever, they did withdraw.

Meanwhile, the terrorist forces that the CIA was organizing,
arming, and training were pursuing their own agenda, right away.
It was no secret. One of the first acts was in 1981 when they
assassinated the President of Egypt, who was one of the most
enthusiastic of their creators. In 1983, one suicide bomber, who
may or may not have been connected, it=B9s pretty shadowy, nobody
knows.  But one suicide bomber drove the US army-military out of
Lebanon. And it continued. They have their own agenda. The US was
happy to mobilize them to fight its cause but meanwhile they are
doing their own thing. They were clear very about it. After 1989,
when the Russians had withdrawn, they simply turned elsewhere.
Since then they have been fighting in Chechnya, Western China,
Bosnia, Kashmir, South East Asia, North Africa, all over the
place.

The Are Telling Us What They Think

They are telling us just what they think. The United States wants
to silence the one free television channel in the Arab world
because it=B9s broadcasting a whole range of things from Powell
over to Osama bin Laden. So the US is now joining the repressive
regimes of the Arab world that try to shut it up. But if you
listen to it, if you listen to what bin Laden says, it=B9s worth
it. There is plenty of interviews. And there are plenty of
interviews by leading Western reporters, if you don=B9t want to
listen to his own voice, Robert Fisk and others. And what he has
been saying is pretty consistent for a long time. He=B9s not the
only one but maybe he is the most eloquent. It=B9s not only
consistent over a long time, it is consistent with their actions.
So there is every reason to take it seriously. Their prime enemy
is what they call the corrupt and oppressive authoritarian brutal
regimes of the Arab world and when the say that they get quite a
resonance in the region. They also want to defend and they want
to replace them by properly Islamist governments. That=B9s where
they lose the people of the region. But up till then, they are
with them. From their point of view, even Saudi Arabia, the most
extreme fundamentalist state in the world, I suppose, short of
the Taliban, which is an offshoot, even that =B9s not Islamist
enough for them. Ok, at that point, they get very little support,
but up until that point they get plenty of support. Also they
want to defend Muslims elsewhere. They hate the Russians like
poison, but as soon as the Russians pulled out of Afghanistan,
they stopped carrying out terrorist acts in Russia as they had
been doing with CIA backing before that within Russia, not just
in Afghanistan. They did move over to Chechnya. But there they
are defending Muslims against a Russian invasion. Same with all
the other places I mentioned. From their point of view, they are
defending the Muslims against the infidels. And they are very
clear about it and that is what they have been doing.

Why did they turn against the United States?

Now why did they turn against the United States? Well that had to
do with what they call the US invasion of Saudi Arabia. In 1990,
the US established permanent military bases in Saudi Arabia which
from their point of view is comparable to a Russian invasion of
Afghanistan except that Saudi Arabia is way more important.
That=B9s the home of the holiest sites of Islam. And that is when
their activities turned against the Unites States. If you recall,
in 1993 they tried to blow up the World Trade Center. Got part of
the way, but not the whole way and that was only part of it. The
plans were to blow up the UN building, the Holland and Lincoln
tunnels, the FBI building. I think there were others on the list.
Well, they sort of got part way, but not all the way. One person
who is jailed for that, finally, among the people who were
jailed, was a Egyptian cleric who had been brought into the
United States over the objections of the Immigration Service,
thanks to the intervention of the CIA which wanted to help out
their friend. A couple years later he was blowing up the World
Trade Center. And this has been going on all over. I=B9m not going
to run through the list but it=B9s, if you want to understand it,
it=B9s consistent. It=B9 s a consistent picture. It=B9s described in
words. It=B9s revealed in practice for 20 years. There is no reason
not to take it seriously. That=B9s the first category, the likely
perpetrators.

Category 2: What about the reservoir of support?

What about the reservoir of support? Well, it=B9s not hard to find
out what that is. One of the good things that has happened since
September 11 is that some of the press and some of the discussion
has begun to open up to some of these things. The best one to my
knowledge is the Wall Street Journal which right away began to
run, within a couple of days, serious reports, searching serious
reports, on the reasons why the people of the region, even though
they hate bin Laden and despise everything he is doing,
nevertheless support him in many ways and even regard him as the
conscience of Islam, as one said. Now the Wall Street Journal and
others, they are not surveying public opinion. They are surveying
the opinion of their friends: bankers, professionals,
international lawyers, businessmen tied to the United States,
people who they interview in MacDonalds restaurant, which is an
elegant restaurant there, wearing fancy American clothes. That=B9s
the people they are interviewing because they want to find out
what their attitudes are. And their attitudes are very explicit
and very clear and in many ways consonant with the message of bin
Laden and others. They are very angry at the United States
because of its support of authoritarian and brutal regimes; its
intervention to block any move towards democracy; its
intervention to stop economic development; its policies of
devastating the civilian societies of Iraq while strengthening
Saddam Hussein; and they remember, even if we prefer not to, that
the United States and Britain supported Saddam Hussein right
through his worst atrocities, including the gassing of the Kurds,
bin Laden brings that up constantly, and they know it even if we
don=B9t want to. And of course their support for the Israeli
military occupation which is harsh and brutal. It is now in its
35th year. The US has been providing the overwhelming economic,
military, and diplomatic support for it, and still does. And they
know that and they don=B9 t like it. Especially when that is paired
with US policy towards Iraq, towards the Iraqi civilian society
which is getting destroyed. Ok, those are the reasons roughly.
And when bin Laden gives those reasons, people recognize it and
support it.

Now that=B9s not the way people here like to think about it, at
least educated liberal opinion. They like the following line
which has been all over the press, mostly from left liberals,
incidentally. I have not done a real study but I think right wing
opinion has generally been more honest. But if you look at say at
the New York Times at the first op-ed they ran by Ronald Steel,
serious left liberal intellectual. He asks Why do they hate us?
This is the same day, I think, that the Wall Street Journal was
running the survey on why they hate us. So he says =B3They hate us
because we champion a new world order of capitalism,
individualism, secularism, and democracy that should be the norm
everywhere.=B2 That=B9s why they hate us. The same day the Wall
Street Journal is surveying the opinions of bankers,
professionals, international lawyers and saying `look, we hate
you because you are blocking democracy, you are preventing
economic development, you are supporting brutal regimes,
terrorist regimes and you are doing these horrible things in the
region.=B9 A couple days later, Anthony Lewis, way out on the left,
explained that the terrorist seek only =B3apocalyptic nihilism,=B2
nothing more and nothing we do matters. The only consequence of
our actions, he says, that could be harmful is that it makes it
harder for Arabs to join in the coalition=B9s anti-terrorism
effort. But beyond that, everything we do is irrelevant.

Well, you know, that=B9s got the advantage of being sort of
comforting. It makes you feel good about yourself, and how
wonderful you are. It enables us to evade the consequences of our
actions. It has a couple of defects. One is it is at total
variance with everything we know. And another defect is that it
is a perfect way to ensure that you escalate the cycle of
violence. If you want to live with your head buried in the sand
and pretend they hate us because they=B9re opposed to
globalization, that=B9s why they killed Sadat 20 years ago, and
fought the Russians, tried to blow up the World Trade Center in
1993. And these are all people who are in the midst of =8A
corporate globalization but if you want to believe that, yeh=8A
comforting. And it is a great way to make sure that violence
escalates. That =B9s tribal violence. You did something to me, I=B9ll
do something worse to you. I don=B9t care what the reasons are. We
just keep going that way. And that=B9s a way to do it. Pretty much
straight, left-liberal opinion.

5. What are the Policy Options?

What are the policy options? Well, there are a number. A narrow
policy option from the beginning was to follow the advice of
really far out radicals like the Pope [audience laughter]. The
Vatican immediately said look it=B9s a horrible terrorist crime. In
the case of crime, you try to find the perpetrators, you bring
them to justice, you try them. You don =B9t kill innocent
civilians. Like if somebody robs my house and I think the guy who
did it is probably in the neighborhood across the street, I don=B9t
go out with an assault rifle and kill everyone in that
neighborhood. That=B9 s not the way you deal with crime, whether
it=B9s a small crime like this one or really massive one like the
US terrorist war against Nicaragua, even worse ones and others in
between. And there are plenty of precedents for that. In fact, I
mentioned a precedent, Nicaragua, a lawful, a law abiding state,
that=B9s why presumably we had to destroy it, which followed the
right principles. Now of course, it didn=B9t get anywhere because
it was running up against a power that wouldn=B9t allow lawful
procedures to be followed. But if the United States tried to
pursue them, nobody would stop them. In fact, everyone would
applaud. And there are plenty of other precedents.

IRA Bombs in London

When the IRA set off bombs in London, which is pretty serious
business, Britain could have, apart from the fact that it was
unfeasible, let=B9s put that aside, one possible response would
have been to destroy Boston which is the source of most of the
financing. And of course to wipe out West Belfast. Well, you
know, quite apart from the feasibility, it would have been
criminal idiocy. The way to deal with it was pretty much what
they did. You know, find the perpetrators; bring them to trial;
and look for the reasons. Because these things don=B9t come out of
nowhere. They come from something. Whether it is a crime in the
streets or a monstrous terrorist crime or anything else. There=B9s
reasons. And usually if you look at the reasons, some of them are
legitimate and ought to be addressed, independently of the crime,
they ought to be addressed because they are legitimate. And
that=B9s the way to deal with it. There are many such examples.

But there are problems with that. One problem is that the United
States does not recognize the jurisdiction of international
institutions. So it can =B9t go to them. It has rejected the
jurisdiction of the World Court. It has refused to ratify the
International Criminal Court. It is powerful enough to set up a
new court if it wants so that wouldn=B9t stop anything. But there
is a problem with any kind of a court, mainly you need evidence.
You go to any kind of court, you need some kind of evidence. Not
Tony Blair talking about it on television. And that=B9s very hard.
It may be impossible to find.

Leaderless Resistance

You know, it could be that the people who did it, killed
themselves. Nobody knows this better than the CIA. These are
decentralized, nonhierarchic networks. They follow a principle
that is called Leaderless Resistance. That =B9s the principle that
has been developed by the Christian Right terrorists in the
United States. It=B9s called Leaderless Resistance. You have small
groups that do things. They don=B9t talk to anybody else. There is
a kind of general background of assumptions and then you do it.
Actually people in the anti war movement are very familiar with
it. We used to call it affinity groups. If you assume correctly
that whatever group you are in is being penetrated by the FBI,
when something serious is happening, you don=B9 t do it in a
meeting. You do it with some people you know and trust, an
affinity group and then it doesn=B9t get penetrated. That=B9s one of
the reasons why the FBI has never been able to figure out what=B9s
going on in any of the popular movements. And other intelligence
agencies are the same. They can=B9t. That=B9s leaderless resistance
or affinity groups, and decentralized networks are extremely hard
to penetrate. And it=B9s quite possible that they just don=B9t know.
When Osama bin Laden claims he wasn =B9t involved, that=B9s entirely
possible. In fact, it=B9s pretty hard to imagine how a guy in a
cave in Afghanistan, who doesn=B9t even have a radio or a telephone
could have planned a highly sophisticated operation like that.
Chances are it=B9s part of the background. You know, like other
leaderless resistance terrorist groups. Which means it=B9s going to
be extremely difficult to find evidence.

Establishing Credibility

And the US doesn=B9t want to present evidence because it wants to
be able to do it, to act without evidence. That=B9s a crucial part
of the reaction. You will notice that the US did not ask for
Security Council authorization which they probably could have
gotten this time, not for pretty reasons, but because the other
permanent members of the Security Council are also terrorist
states. They are happy to join a coalition against what they call
terror, namely in support of their own terror. Like Russia wasn=B9t
going to veto, they love it. So the US probably could have gotten
Security Council authorization but it didn=B9t want it. And it
didn=B9t want it because it follows a long-standing principle which
is not George Bush, it was explicit in the Clinton
administration, articulated and goes back much further and that
is that we have the right to act unilaterally. We don=B9t want
international authorization because we act unilaterally and
therefore we don =B9t want it. We don=B9t care about evidence. We
don=B9t care about negotiation. We don=B9t care about treaties. We
are the strongest guy around; the toughest thug on the block. We
do what we want. Authorization is a bad thing and therefore must
be avoided. There is even a name for it in the technical
literature. It=B9s called establishing credibility. You have to
establish credibility. That=B9s an important factor in many
policies. It was the official reason given for the war in the
Balkans and the most plausible reason.

You want to know what credibility means, ask your favorite Mafia
Don. He =B9 ll explain to you what credibility means. And it=B9s the
same in international affairs, except it=B9s talked about in
universities using big words, and that sort of thing. But it=B9s
basically the same principle. And it makes sense. And it usually
works. The main historian who has written about this in the last
couple years is Charles Tilly with a book called Coercion,
Capital, and European States. He points out that violence has
been the leading principle of Europe for hundreds of years and
the reason is because it works. You know, it=B9s very reasonable.
It almost always works. When you have an overwhelming
predominance of violence and a culture of violence behind it. So
therefore it makes sense to follow it. Well, those are all
problems in pursuing lawful paths. And if you did try to follow
them you=B9d really open some very dangerous doors. Like the US is
demanding that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden. And they
are responding in a way which is regarded as totally absurd and
outlandish in the west, namely they are saying, Ok, but first
give us some evidence. In the west, that is considered ludicrous.
It=B9s a sign of their criminality. How can they ask for evidence?
I mean if somebody asked us to hand someone over, we=B9d do it
tomorrow. We wouldn=B9t ask for any evidence. [crowd laughter].

Haiti

In fact it is easy to prove that. We don=B9t have to make up cases.
So for example, for the last several years, Haiti has been
requesting the United States to extradite Emmanuel Constant. He
is a major killer. He is one of the leading figures in the
slaughter of maybe 4000 or 5000 people in the years in the mid
1990=B9s, under the military junta, which incidentally was being,
not so tacitly, supported by the Bush and the Clinton
administrations contrary to illusions. Anyway he is a leading
killer. They have plenty of evidence. No problem about evidence.
He has already been brought to trial and sentenced in Haiti and
they are asking the United States to turn him over. Well, I mean
do your own research. See how much discussion there has been of
that. Actually Haiti renewed the request a couple of weeks ago.
It wasn=B9t even mentioned. Why should we turn over a convicted
killer who was largely responsible for killing 4000 or 5000
people a couple of years ago. In fact, if we do turn him over,
who knows what he would say. Maybe he=B9ll say that he was being
funded and helped by the CIA, which is probably true. We don=B9t
want to open that door. And he is not he only one.

Costa Rica

I mean, for the last about 15 years, Costa Rica which is the
democratic prize, has been trying to get the United States to
hand over a John Hull, a US land owner in Costa Rica, who they
charge with terrorist crimes. He was using his land, they claim
with good evidence as a base for the US war against Nicaragua,
which is not a controversial conclusion, remember. There is the
World Court and Security Council behind it. So they have been
trying to get the United States to hand him over. Hear about that
one? No.

They did actually confiscate the land of another American
landholder, John Hamilton. Paid compensation, offered
compensation. The US refused. Turned his land over into a
national park because his land was also being used as a base for
the US attack against Nicaragua. Costa Rica was punished for that
one. They were punished by withholding aid. We don=B9t accept that
kind of insubordination from allies. And we can go on. If you
open the door to questions about extradition it leads in very
unpleasant directions. So that can=B9t be done.

Reactions in Afghanistan

Well, what about the reactions in Afghanistan. The initial
proposal, the initial rhetoric was for a massive assault which
would kill many people visibly and also an attack on other
countries in the region. Well the Bush administration wisely
backed off from that. They were being told by every foreign
leader, NATO, everyone else, every specialist, I suppose, their
own intelligence agencies that that would be the stupidest thing
they could possibly do. It would simply be like opening
recruiting offices for bin Laden all over the region. That=B9s
exactly what he wants. And it would be extremely harmful to their
own interests. So they backed off that one. And they are turning
to what I described earlier which is a kind of silent genocide.
It=B9s a=8A. well, I already said what I think about it. I don=B9 t
think anything more has to be said. You can figure it out if you
do the arithmetic.

A sensible proposal which is kind of on the verge of being
considered, but it has been sensible all along, and it is being
raised, called for by expatriate Afghans and allegedly tribal
leaders internally, is for a UN initiative, which would keep the
Russians and Americans out of it, totally. These are the 2
countries that have practically wiped the country out in the last
20 years. They should be out of it. They should provide massive
reparations. But that=B9s their only role. A UN initiative to bring
together elements within Afghanistan that would try to construct
something from the wreckage. It=B9s conceivable that that could
work, with plenty of support and no interference. If the US
insists on running it, we might as well quit. We have a
historical record on that one.

You will notice that the name of this operation=8A.remember that at
first it was going to be a Crusade but they backed off that
because PR (public relations) agents told them that that wouldn=B9t
work [audience laughter]. And then it was going to be Infinite
Justice, but the PR agents said, wait a minute, you are sounding
like you are divinity. So that wouldn=B9t work. And then it was
changed to enduring freedom. We know what that means. But nobody
has yet pointed out, fortunately, that there is an ambiguity
there. To endure means to suffer. [audience laughter]. And a
there are plenty of people around the world who have endured what
we call freedom. Again, fortunately we have a very well-behaved
educated class so nobody has yet pointed out this ambiguity. But
if its done there will be another problem to deal with. But if we
can back off enough so that some more or less independent agency,
maybe the UN, maybe credible NGO=B9s (non governmental
organizations) can take the lead in trying to reconstruct
something from the wreckage, with plenty of assistance and we owe
it to them. Them maybe something would come out. Beyond that,
there are other problems.

An Easy Way To Reduce The Level Of Terror

We certainly want to reduce the level of terror, certainly not
escalate it. There is one easy way to do that and therefore it is
never discussed. Namely stop participating in it. That would
automatically reduce the level of terror enormously. But that you
can=B9t discuss. Well we ought to make it possible to discuss it.
So that=B9s one easy way to reduce the level of terror.

Beyond that, we should rethink the kinds of policies, and
Afghanistan is not the only one, in which we organize and train
terrorist armies. That has effects. We=B9re seeing some of these
effects now. September 11th is one. Rethink it.

Rethink the policies that are creating a reservoir of support.
Exactly what the bankers, lawyers and so on are saying in places
like Saudi Arabia. On the streets it=B9s much more bitter, as you
can imagine. That=B9s possible. You know, those policies aren=B9t
graven in stone.

And further more there are opportunities. It=B9s hard to find many
rays of light in the last couple of weeks but one of them is that
there is an increased openness. Lots of issues are open for
discussion, even in elite circles, certainly among the general
public, that were not a couple of weeks ago. That=B9s dramatically
the case. I mean, if a newspaper like USA Today can run a very
good article, a serious article, on life in the Gaza Strip=8Athere
has been a change. The things I mentioned in the Wall Street
Journal=8Athat=B9s change. And among the general public, I think
there is much more openness and willingness to think about things
that were under the rug and so on. These are opportunities and
they should be used, at least by people who accept the goal of
trying to reduce the level of violence and terror, including
potential threats that are extremely severe and could make even
September 11th pale into insignificance. Thanks.

Rereading my "Under Attack" that appeared in the September 13 Poetics Digest

          My eye for your eye

            Tooth for tooth

     This is still the disgraceful truth




           Bless me bless you

            Civilized manners

    Thank you but when it comes to blows

           Then everything goes

           I burn then you burn

            & so the story goes

          Lets shake hands on that




            For tortured minds

      Those who burn burn most inside

  Kindness & compassion in this kind of war

       If won all our work is done




             Under attack

    We face powerful & terrible enemies

        Are we winning this war

Went to this.  It was really fun.  It reminded me of some installation art
I've seen at museums or galleries, but in those settings people are
pretentious and serious about their work, whereas you folks were doing it
for the fun of it and had a good sense of humor.  Some of the work was
striking and beautiful in a fairly traditional way (I'm thinking of the
sequence of poems and watercolors) and some stuff was just fun, like the
poetry rocks which are crumpled up poems with a saran wrap covering, and you
are supposed to throw them at people, who then open them and read the poem.

The free books were cool, too.

Do you exhibit computer based art/poetry?  If so, I might be interested in
participating.  For example, I have an e-poem, "The Tyrannical Rhinoceri of
Bangladesh" at www.sporkworld.org/rhino.html
If I were to do something for an anti-reading though, I'd ,ake it more
substantial and more experimental than that piece, though.

It's that time again ... the fourth Anti-Reading will
take place this saturday from 1:30-4:00 at Tonic.
Expect the usual suspects and a few new faces.

Come rain or shine. Hope to see you there.


Anti-Reading

Tonic
(107 Norfolk Street -- F to Delancey)

November 3, 2001

1:30 ? 4:00 pm

Free

For those that associate boredom (and we all do) with
literary functions, Loudmouth Collective presents an
anti-reading of new work by Matvei Yankelevich, Joel
Schlemowitz, Ryan Haley, James Hoff, Wanda Phipps,
Ellie Ga, Marisol Martinez, Julien Poirier, Filip
Marinovic and many others.

Following the success of  earlier anti-readings at
Tonic, Loudmouth Collective is presenting the fourth
installment of this bi-monthly literary carnival.
Expect live typewriter art, concrete poetry, language
installations, paperless books, poetry film and loads
of free books.

By providing a bi-monthly forum for the experimental
presentation of literature, Loudmouth Collective seeks
to re-evaluate the literary reading as it has come to
be known today, recasting it as something more than an
exercise to sell books. The anti-reading couples
authors with the public through intermedia encounters,
providing the basis for an ongoing dialogue between
the writer and reader. Anti-readings resemble a school
carnival, a literary event with no center and no
reading.

Loudmouth Collective is a young, Brooklyn-based press
dedicated to portable fiction and poetry, artists'
books and sound art.

syntaxerrors: a series of performed lectures

03      Counter-Interpellation
        Aaron Vidaver
        Tuesday, November 6, 2001

        Fletcher Challenge Theatre
        SFU Harbour Centre 7:30 pm
        Vancouver BC
        Admission $5 / $3

syntaxerrors is a series of three 'performed lectures', investigating
the relationship between authoritative language, presentation
technologies and performance art.

Presented over three evening events, syntaxerrors will combine forms
of art performance, pedagogical histrionics and conference tactics to
create, along with technological tools, a form of cultural practice
that confounds the categories of public address with inventiveness
and humour. This series will negotiate the systems of language
delivery found in performance art, with its history of personal
confessional narrative and attention to the body of the Performer,
and the passive authority and implied objectivity of the Speaker with
her/his disembodied 'meta-voice'. The series will take place in the
hushed comfort and the seamless technological support of an SFU
Harbour Centre lecture theatre.

In the context of Live: Vancouver Biennial of Performance Art, the
series broadens the definition of performance to include a critical
investigation of the relationship between language, technology and
visual art, challenging festival audiences to consider the tradition
of performance art in relation to institutional interventions.

Aaron Vidaver, who will present the third performance in this series,
is a writer and archivist. Drawing upon his archival work for
cultural organizations, artist-run centres, and educational
institutions as well as his previous interventions in public space,
Vidaver builds a performed lecture addressing juridical selfhood and
linguistic dissent. Counter-Interpellation uses a recitation of his
report card evaluations,
beginning in kindergarten and extending through to his university
studies to punctuate a discussion of subjection in Althusser's theory
of interpellation.

Vidaver edits the Documents in Poetics series for the Friends of
Runcible Mountain and is an associate of the Centre for Contemporary
Writing. He coordinates Studies in Practical Negation, a seminar on
oppositional writing at the Kootenay School of Writing, and is
currently working on Unentitled, a long poem, and A Field Guide to
Feral Ornaments, a prose collaboration with Steven Ward and Roger
Farr.

Is manifesto, sweet manifesto:

We in the last quarter of 2001 affirm the following guidelines for
the production of literature, patterned on the manifesto of the
Dogme95 filmmakers. The Dogme95 Manifesto declared itself
to be a “VOW OF CHASTITY” from the coercive representational
techniques of mass-market cinema (sets, lighting, musical
soundtracks, etc.); Dogma ’01 goes even further, rejecting the
no less coercive marketing and distribution apparatus which
Dogme95 filmmakers seem content to have deployed on their
behalf. Dogma ’01 rejects the division of labor between writer and
publisher that prevails in the literary market-place, and therefore
its productions are unfit for all but the most informal modes of
distribution (barter, give-aways, and low-volume sales). These
rules are to ensure that they remain so:

1. Dogma ’01 is unalienated labor. Author and publisher will ideally
be the same person. If not, they are to share the labor and cost
of printing. Dogma ’01 productions are to be assembled and
bound by hand. No sending books out to be Docu-teched, and no
perfect binding.

2. The contents of Dogma ’01 books should be photocopied. Type
may be set on a word processor or typewriter, but handwriting (the
textual equivalent of the hand-held camera mandated by Dogme95)
is best. No technique of reproduction is definitively barred, but those
methods and materials most widely available to the general public
are preferred. What in the world of fine printing are considered
defects, Dogma ’01 views as beauty marks: staples, thumbprints,
“binder’s creep,” etc.

3. The one-of-a-kind is hateful. Editions should be as large as
humanly possible, unsigned, and un-numbered (except perhaps to
compensate for the flaws of “first fruits” rush-jobbed in time for a
reading). Scarcity should never be artificially maintained in order to
drive up exchange value. At such time as an author’s Dogma ’01
publication turns out to be a valuable commodity (i.e., quickly
reselling for inflated amounts soon after issue), that author is obliged
to produce ever-larger editions to compensate. Should demand
exceed the author’s production capacity, that author is obliged
to withdraw from Dogma ’01 and either go with a mainstream
publisher, or become one. This is the only excuse for going with or
becoming a mainstream publisher.

4. Publishing in journals is kind of a gray area, on which we do not
care to pronounce. Without it, Dogma ’01 would risk becoming a
solipsistic enterprise, with a readership as tightly circumscribed as
that of any corporation’s report to its shareholders. On the other hand,
the wider an author’s public, the harder it will be for that author to
remain within the bounds of Dogma ’01. The same goes for
anthologies. Nor have we come to grips with the question of later
reprints of Dogma ’01 productions. Entering contests is fine,
unless you win one.

5. Dogma ’01 is not a bid for elite/outsider status, but the affirmation
of a literary and artistic sphere of exchange unmediated by the
apparatuses of market capitalism. (Except does the post office count?)
Authors need not lose money to qualify, though they assuredly will.
Dogma ’01 authors are to maintain cordial and friendly relationships
with mere writers. No Dogma ’01 clubs or juries are to be formed,
and no one whose work meets these Dogma ’01 criteria is barred.
You will know it when you see it.

Dogma ’01 is no guarantee of quality. Without going so far as to abolish
the category of “artistic merit,” it is our stance that 1) the above criteria
are more important at the present moment in the history of writing, and
that 2) they lead to better work anyway, aesthetically as much as
ethically speaking.

You are invited to reproduce and disseminate this manifesto freely.
We will not rest until the earth is encased in a rustling jacket of paper.
Oh wait, that’s already happened.

Oakland, Calif., 10/6/2001

On behalf of Dogma ’01

AN EVENING OF WORDS AND MUSIC BY DOC POMUS

Readings and performances by LOU REED, DR. JOHN, SEX MOB, JIMMY SCOTT, GART=
H
HUDSON, PETER GURALNICK, CHOCOLATE GENIUS, OLU DARA, BOB MOULD, MAUD, JOEL
DORN and special guests

On Wednesday, November 7th at 8 pm, The Poetry Project, located in St.
Mark=B9s Church in-the-Bowery at 2nd Avenue and 10th Street in Manhattan,
hosts Hal Willner=B9s Doc Pomus Project, an evening of Doc Pomus=B9 words and
music, read and performed by the the legendary singer-songwriter=B9s friends,
admirers, and collaborators. Doc Pomus (1925 - 1991)=8Bwhose songwriting
partners included Mort Schuman, Leiber & Stoller, and Dr. John=8Bwrote
standards such as "Save the Last Dance For Me," "This Magic Moment," "Young
Blood," "Teenager in Love," and "I Count the Tears." Pomus will be
celebrated by an all-star cast, including Lou Reed, Dr. John, Sex Mob, Bob
Mould, Maud, Joel Dorn, Jimmy Scott, Garth Hudson, Peter Guralnick,
Chocolate Genius, Olu Dara, and special guests. Produced by Hal Willner,
whose credits include the soundtracks for Robert Altman=B9s films Kansas City
and Short Cuts, the evening will be a benefit for the Poetry Project, which
for 35 years has been this country=B9s premier venue for new poetry.
ADMISSION: $25 general; $20 for Poetry Project members; and $200 for
reserved seats, post-performance party, and special limited-edition Pomus
CD.=20

Born Jerome Felder in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, legendary
singer-songwriter Doc Pomus wrote, "The important thing is to be the
poet=8Bnot the famous poet=8Bthere are so many uncontrollable intangibles that
make up recognition and success." Performers in Hal Willner=B9s Doc Pomus
Project will read from Pomus=B9s journals, recite published and unpublished
lyrics, and of course, sing some of Pomus=B9s best-known songs. Willner has
pulled together a distinguished cast for the evening.

LOU REED was a founding member of the influential band The Velvet
Underground, whose solo album, Transformer (1972), produced by David Bowie,
included one of Reed's most memorable songs ever, "Walk on the Wild Side."
Reed=B9s recent work has included collaborations for the stage with Robert
Wilson and a successful and critically acclaimed series of solo albums
including Set the Twilight Reeling and Perfect Night, Live in London. DR.
JOHN, a formidable boogie and blues pianist with an infectious growl of a
voice, made some of his most enduring achievements by fusing New Orleans
R&B, rock, and Mardi Gras craziness to come up with his own brand of
"voodoo" music. Among his recent works are Anutha Zone and Duke Elegant, as
well as the autobiography, Under a Hoodoo Moon. Jimmy Scott, (formerly know=
n
as "LITTLE JIMMY SCOTT") has performed jazz ballads and blues songs for ove=
r
half a century. Scott=B9s most recent albums include All the Way, Dream, and
Heaven. GARTH HUDSON is a unique gospel-oriented keyboardist and one of the
original members of The Band, whose playing is prominent on such classic
songs as "The Weight" and "Rag Mama Rag." PETER GURALNICK is widely regarde=
d
as the nation's preeminent writer on twentieth-century American popular
music. Guralnick=B9s books include Feel Like Going Home, Lost Highway,
Searching for Robert Johnson, and a highly acclaimed two-volume biography o=
f
Elvis Presley, Last Train to Memphis and Careless Love. SEX MOB, a New
York-based avant jazz group, has performed nationally, rendering free jazz
versions of songs by such rock artists as Nirvana, Abba, the Grateful Dead
and Prince. CHOCOLATE GENIUS is the brainchild of Marc Anthony Thompson, wh=
o
you may remember from his two previous Warner Brothers=B9 offerings (his
eponymous debut and Watts & Paris). His new V2 release, Black Music is due
out on July 14. OLU DARA has been a part of New York=B9s jazz circles for 20
years. His album "In the World" embraces Caribbean rhythms, African
highlife/socca riffs, and gut-bucket blues.

Founded in 1966 by the late poet and translator, Paul Blackburn, the Poetry
Project, located in the landmark St. Mark=B9s Church in-the-Bowery in New Yor=
k
City=B9s East Village, has for over three decades been this country=B9s premier
venue for new and experimental poetries. Time Out New York, in its
"Essential New York" issue, which listed the Poetry Project as one of "101
Reasons To Be Glad You=B9re Here," says: "More than three decades later, it
[the Poetry Project] remains a major forum for experimental poets, a meetin=
g
place=20
for literary types and an important part of what remains of the city=B9s
countercultural spirit."
    Now in its 36th season, the Poetry Project continues to furnish
encourage-ment and resources to poets, writers, artists and performers whos=
e
work is experimental, innovative and pertinent. The Poetry Project offers a
Wednesday night reading series, a Monday night reading/performance series, =
a
Friday night events series, three weekly writing workshops, literary
magazines, a quarterly newsletter, a web site at www.poetryproject.com, and
tape and document archives.

The Poetry Project=B9s programs and publications are made possible, in part,
with public funds from; the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York
State Council on the Arts, the City of New York=B9s Department of Cultural
Affairs and the Materials for the Arts/New York City Department of Cultural
Affairs and Department of Sanitation.
The Poetry Project=B9s programs and publications are also made possible with

"Post-America: Last Drop"


The remains of the child Dial-Up Networking are delivered via important
virtual courier by the chief inspector of the subdivision, a wiry man with
muscles on each arm, a thousand centipedes crawling beneath the surface of
his skin, reproducing in a fantastic exponential stream of organic chunks
resembling underground lava so that his entire insides undulate as an
aggregate toward the heart, and everything he touches absorbs a measure of
fluidity and fadeout for the first few seconds of contact, before
reassuming the proper shape.  The contents of his ashcan parcel are
earmarked for the food processors and coffee makers in Supply.  From there
everything is born just the same as before-legacies live out their pension
time on the golf course, at the Laundromat lost in the whirl of nouveau
Martin-I-zing, gambling on the peripheries of the new reservations-there,
blood type gets you in, and everybody's a native.  The sheer physicality of
the clerk is a joy reserved for when the bosses aren't around and the
inspector seems to be one of the regular crew so much that even the CEO
makes only a thousand times more than the lowest paid jizmopper.  In such
cases video-watching is used as a backdrop for more uninhibited behavior
such as farting burping and going off into the rafters for the sheer,
competitive hell of it all.

Even the inert supplies are crafted to watch and record.  Take the ashes
for instance.  Who knows where they came from, whose they were?  The clerks
surely don't.  Oh sure there's a file card and a punch card and electronic
digital imaging signal and kinesthetic amplifiers and adjuvant
synth-muscles and a aerodynamic cock and thermal shield and coolant matrix
and carpal, metacarpal, and ante-brachial assemblies inside all mixed
together like a cake before it's baked in somebody else's vagina….but who
is to say this ain't all an elaborate games played at the expense of the
clerks?  Who is to say that the supply office even serves a purpose in the
traditional sense?

Certainly not the workers…

It may as well be the Great Repression and these guys and dolls are
figuring to be short timers, sure, and they know the nature of things is
more fluid, less solid than it was back in grandpappy's heyday, but still,
it has become routine for them to deny the physical body altogether at the
workplace, no longer a site of labor for the reproduction of goods
essential to the multinational state: clerks do not therefore eat,
defecate, reproduce the human species or distribute the various parcels
with any sense that they *aren't* a part of a vast multinational network.
The inspector spoke with one clerk, the one soon to be in charge of the
ashes, who put it bluntly with four fingers up his ass and a hand on the
kiddy porn web site sponsored by the Blue Jean Chemical Concern: "Yeah,
we're part of a vast tapestry, doing the good work of the holy Feedback
LOOP.  We're building the new economy from the ground up with
micro-business applications expandable on the global level."

The sort of drivel one might hear in an insane asylum has overrun the whole
federal medical scheme.  Lend your ear.  Wait in line for your weekly organ
transplant and grow your own on the back of a lab mouse.  Squash da neck.
The inspector and clerk share so much of the common purpose and place, and
everything proceeds with such tantamount permutations of the existing
materials, then what can be made of earlier people's isolationist impulses?

The ashes of dead children spread over the hemispheres in a second or third
big bang, warm and vibrant, expanding and contracting in a regular pattern
which has been gradually picked, created, and coded, sensitive and ready,
at the slightest caress, to cause a frightful damage.  The lack of light
and air in the supply room is not stuffy enough for the clerks, who are
both robotic and assuredly human specimens, aware of the purpose, place and
destiny, online and inline, for the duration of the project's drain on
traditional resources and equipment.  Everything collapses at the same time
so no one even notices.

The ceremonial is complete and the inspector is satisfied that the ashes of
Dial-Up Networking, so recently and sadly deceased, will be treated with
the proper respect due to her maintenance profile.  "Cut this one with
caffeine if you want her to last longer," says the inspector as he salutes
the clerk now in charge, officially, of the ashes.  "Everything seems to be
in order here," he says and slurps up a draught of the bitter ash coffee --
Post-America's finest, strangest brew.

for shipping)
we will immediately send you out the book.


Albues, Tereza
PEDRA CANGA (Trans. by Clifford E. Landers)
Green Integer (153 pp.)
October 4, 2001 (Paper $12.95)
(1-82295-70-9)

     This 1987 Brazilian novel is a lusty and likable compact chronicle =
of a "wetlands"
village (Pedra Canga) whose inhabitants are oppressed by, and eventually =
liberated
from the malign influence of the wealthy family who have long exploited =
them. Albues's
unnamed narrator, a fledgling woman writer, gathers fragmentary stories =
about the
"demonic" Vergare clan from a vigorously described townful of =
larger-than-life eccentrics,
including the Vergares' terrified servant Nivalda (a reputed "witch"), =
puritantical
spinster and hellraiser Ludovica Hosteater, and the narrator's own =
ribald, Zorba-
like grandfather ("always fond of parties, guitars, and rum"). An empty =
house in-
explicably changes colors, ghosts and zombies mingle casually with the =
living,
and a cleansing storm ultimately restores order, in a wry =
magical-realist tale which
Albues expertly shapes into a colorfully bawdy and exuberant celebration =
of life.

    Thursday  November 1 8:52 PM EST
    Justice Department, Microsoft Near Deal


    Washington DC - Microsoft Corp. and the US Justice Department are
reportedly nearing an agreement to settle their long-running antitrust
dispute. The deal places the software maker under supervision by the US
government for the next five to seven years, but allows it to maintain its
software products as is. In return, the government has agreed to establish
Redmond as a new state, and has offered Microsoft a controlling interest in
both the Senate and the House of Representatives for the next five to seven
years. In addition, John Ashcroft will receive $2 billion in cash and stock
in exchange for harassing Oracle, Sun and AOL-TW for the next 5 years.

Attorneys General for the states also prosecuting the case said that they
would oppose any deal that didn't protect the rights of consumers, however,
for $3 billion dollars they "may reconsider their priorities."

President Bush was pleased with the news. "America must move ahead with the
task at hand. Our country faces a great danger and with the help of Windows
XP we can have an army of flying soldiers to help with the war on terrorism,"
said Bush.

Attorney General John Ashcroft dismissed criticism that the government was
selling out citizen's rights to corporate America. "That's ridiculous," said
Ashcroft, "I'm a citizen. Look how good of a deal I'm getting."

A recent poll showed that Americans were evenly divided on the issue. When
asked what they thought of the Microsoft settlement half of Americans didn't
care and the other half were worried about anthrax.

Hello all!
     I'm new to the list serve and a little afraid to jump into the fray.
But poetics is fearlessness, right!
I wanted to offer a quick word on the War & Peace Show at the American
Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore.
Amazing! It moved me in its necessary confrontation and negotiation of war,
peace, conflict, comfort, desire, frustration, memory, pain . . . but also
in the way that it really pushed me to reconsider my own aesthetic--and
poetic---values in regard to war and peace. At this moment, I have received
more poems via e-mail from more people who have never read or circulated
poems before. At this moment, I have heard more people who had never
previously self-identified as poets
testify to their poetry writing. And at this moment, I have heard more and
more poets--including myself--question what the work should be and do now.
     So I am wondering about the poetics of war and peace--in particular if
we attempt to push beyond the rhetorical . . . Or should we try to push
beyond the rhetorical? Any thoughts? And more specifically, any titles of
poems to help me bend my mind around all this?
     Thanks! Gabrielle

The University of Georgia Creative Writing Program

is happy to announce its graduate student-choice reader,

esteemed poet and translator, Heather McHugh.



Heather McHugh will give a poetry reading

Monday, November 12th

at 4:30 room 265 Park Hall.

The event is free and open to the public.



Heather McHugh's books of poetry include Father of thePredicaments (1999); Hinge & Sign: Poems 1961-1993 (Wesleyan University Press, 1994), which won both the Boston Book Review's Bingham Poetry Prize and the Pollack-Harvard Review Prize, was a Finalist for the National Book Award, and was named a "Notable Book of the Year" by the New York Times Book Review; Shades (1988); To the Quick (1987); A World of Difference (1981); and Dangers (1977). She is also the author of Broken English: Poetry and Partiality (1993), and three books of translation: Glottal Stop:  101 Poems by Paul Celan (with Niko Boris, 2001), Because the Sea is Black: Poems of Blaga Dimitrova (with Niko Boris, 1989) and D'après tout: Poems by Jean Follain (1981)


Her honors include two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Griffin Poetry Prize, and a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship. In 1999 she was elected a Chancellor of The Academy of American Poets. Heather McHugh teaches as a core faculty member in the
MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College, and as Milliman Writer-in-Residence at the University of Washington in Seattle. She is frequently appointed as Visiting Professor at the Writers' Workshop in Iowa, and has held chairs at University of California at
Berkeley, University of Alabama, and University of Cincinnati.

If ours were a more reverent country than the one
John Ashbery and Heather McHugh gorgeously exemplify,
these two would long ago have been made to endure the
title of national treasures. For the treasure we too
long have taken for granted—our fractious, healing,
double-dealing, on-the-make vernacular—is nowhere so
richly turned to account as in the poems they have
been giving us for years.
—Linda Gregerson, New York Times Book Review

Her writing is so alert to itself, so alert to
language, it's like watching a dancer on a mirrored
floor, stepping on her steps. She's practically
playing with her words as she writes them down.
'Joycean' is a word that comes to mind.... This kind
of writing could seem like pure playfulness, but in
McHugh it rarely does.... She's a poet for whom wit is
a form of spiritual survival.

TALK by BARRETT WATTEN: "Writing Bad History"
Auditorium, New Orleans Public Library (downtown)
219 Loyola Ave.
Free
Watten will address the relation of poetry to traumatic historical events,
from Vietnam to the Gulf War to the present, in relation to the writing of
his book-length prose poem Bad History.

*******************************

PETER GIZZI is a poet and publisher living in Northhampton, Massachusetts.
His poetry collections include Artificial Heart (1998), Add This to the
House (1999), Hours of the Book (1994), and Periplum (1992). Gizzi teaches
in the MFA program at the University of Massachusetts. Andrew McCord states
that "Artificial Heart is on the quixotic mission of recovering the lyric.
What Gizzi is doing, and what many others could do fruitfully, is taking
the current doubt-ridden, cross-referential ways of reading and writing to
heart while holding on to the old dream of making sense."

BARRETT WATTEN is a poet and writer of literary and cultural criticism. His
books of poetry include Progress/Under Erasure (forthcoming), Bad History
(1998), Frame: 1971-1990 (1997), and Complete Thought (1982). Currently he
teaches modernism and cultural studies at Wayne State University in Detroit
and is coeditor of Poetics Journal. Of Watten's writing, Jacques Debrot
states that "it solicits from the reader . . . a constant questioning whose
resolution is not guaranteed by plot or by character but is centered
persistently (to borrow the emphatic title he and Robert Grenier gave to
their seminal journal) on this: this page, these words, here and now."

P-p-pardon? Class does not exist?

Well, I can assure you, Ray, that +perception+ of class most certainly does
exist, and so do inbuilt social inequalities, inbuilt because they depend on
inherited wealth and advantage, if you don't believe me please explain the
existence of the British Royal Family, class totem par extraordinaire.

That's not to say I subscribe to Marx (the class 'system' predated him
y'know) nor the hi-jacking of these matters into academic orthodoxies, but,
really, 'class does not exist'.

How I wish it didn't.

Hi Damian

A dialogue between Patrick Durgin and Andrew Levy, to be printed in the
second issue of _antennae_, might be of interest to you. Levy speaks
wonderfully of the relation between his percussive and improvisatory
practices and his writing practices, and of his learnings from certain Jazz
drummers. In the same issue will be printed a Stein dance scenario by George
Albon, which uses Thomson's solo piano portraiture as accompaniment. Also, a
piece for four voices by Kunsu Shim, which uses as source the words of
Robert Creeley. And some other text/sound intersections. I'm so glad to hear
you're working this terrain. Best,

Jesse Seldess

Cheers to fellow Bostonian Dan Bouchard for questioning the consideration of the
"enemy" as "mice."  We know there's much more to it than that.  And, yes, we
should be held to a higher standard Dan. Thank you.  The following is a poem by
the Vietnamese poet Lam Thi Mi Dah, depicting the wreckage of what life was like
for those on the other side the last time we fell to thinking of humans as
rodents:

                The Sky in a Bomb Crater

                Your friends said that you, a roadbuilder,
                 had such love for our country, you rushed
                 down the trail that night, waving your torch
                 to save the convoy, calling the bombs down on yourself.

                 We passed by the spot where you died,
                 tried to picture the young girl you once had been.
                 We pitched stones up on the barren grave,
                 adding our love to a rising pile of stone.

                 I gaze into the center of the crater
                 where you died and saw the sky in the pool
                 of rain water. Our country is so kind:
                 water from the sky washes the pain away.

                 Now you rest deep in the ground,
                 quiet as the sky that rests in the crater.
                 At night your soul pours down,
                 bright as the stars.

                 I wonder, could it be your soft skin
                 changed into columns of white clouds?
                 Could it be that when we passed that day,
                 it was not the sun but your heart breaking through?

                 This jungle trail now bears your name;
                 the skies reach down to your death and touch it;
                 and we, who never saw your face,
                 each wear a trace of you, bright on our cheek.

   (Translated by Ngo Vinh Hai and Kevin Bowen, published in compost #4, 1997)

Christian Bok
Eunoia
Coach House Books
ISBN: 1--5245--092--9
Paper, $16.95
112 pages


"Writing is inhibiting.  Sighing, I sit, scribbling in ink this pidgin
script.  I sing with nihilistic witticism, disciplining signs with trifling
gimmicks -- impish hijinks which highlight stick sigils.  Isn't it glib?
Isn't it chic?"  Besides being glib and chic, Bok's new book strikes one
with the force of being the most incredible literary curio -- each of its
chapters is only allowed to use one vowel, out-gunning the Oulipian Perec by
four -- and yet a sort of heroic, epic undertaking. Taking seven years to
write (the time it took Joyce to write Ulysses) "Eunoia" -- which means
"beautiful thinking" and is the shortest word in the English language to
employ all the vowels -- uses other constraints, including the same length
for each paragraph, parallel sentence structures and tons of internal
rhyme; furthermore, each of its chapters must "allude to the art of writing
[and] must describe a culinary banquet, a prurient debauch, a pastoral
tableau, and a nautical voyage."  This hyper-mechanization of the writer's
craft sets the stage for a welter of eccentric, yet universally appealing,
tours-de-force, such as Chapter E's retelling of the Odyssey from the
viewpoint of Helen: "Whenever Helen seeks these perverse excesses, her
regretted deeds depress her; hence, Helen beseeches Ceres (the blessed
Demeter): 'let sweet Lethe bless me, lest these recent events be rememberd'
-- then the empress feeds herself fermented hempseed, her preferred
nepenthe."  Each vowel infects the writing with its specific tone and
content: the "a" chapter, the tale of Hassan "an Agha Khan", is the most
mellifluous, an Orientalist playground of Arabs and naptha lamps, while the
"u" chapter presents the most intense vision of lustful excess under the
stress of arbitrary restraints, in which "Dutch smut churns up blushful
succubus lusts," and Ubu and Lulu burp, hump and bump for five delirious
pages, exhausting, in the meantime, the entire range of English words that
only contain the vowel "u."  "Oiseau," the second half of this book, is a
collection of shorter works such as his homage to the "w," a poem that uses
no vowels but the letter "y" (more than you'd think), and his phonetic
translation of Rimbaud's sonnet "Voyelle," thus cementing Bok's allegience
to a language that literally seems to write itself, provided it find the
perfect -- both obsessive and linguistically adept -- host.

Gwynn. I maybe got a bit carried away, so to speak: just thought you were
confusing the issues of feminism with this war... in which we seem to be
agreed is stupid (either side) and as to the Taleban "winning" I dont think
anyone is going to win: least of all the poor or working people (and I
consider any one who doesnt actually own the means of production as a
"worker"..hence I include professors as well as streetcleaners etc) of the
US or Afgahanistan or any other nation.
   I would rather see a thorough going investigation and dissemination of
education from all sides...rather than this stupid reaction by Bush-Blair
etal ....I sent a message of support to the American WOMAN I most admire,
that is Barbara who voted against the call to war: a woman I admire.
  Of course. in the long term, I want to see the cause of REAL democracy and
human rights and also women's rights advanced. I used the comparison "East"
versus "West"  women as a kind of devil's advocation: of course its not too
relevant and doesnt further the argument  (unless I was trying to show how
others might see the picture...I dont see it that way). The main thing is to
learn more about politics history and so on - I just hapenned on an
interesting book by an Israeli journalist who posed as a Palestinian, which
is  quite revealing - and for me and others to get rational and human about
all this: and I'm talking to myself as well as others. Regards, Richard.

i am russian; and they want me dead because i am american. they want you
dead, as well. and if they ever lay their hands on you, should your life be

forget
what e-mail is. (of course, there will still be a plenty of drugs).

Igor, did they tell you all that? Wow. That could have been long enough to
get a trace on the call.

Do you want the people responsible for all other acts of violence captured
or killed?

| but war is war.

I find this so persuasive and penetrating, I must rethink everything. OK
finished. It has general application, too: violence is violence, hysteria is
hysteria, propaganda is propaganda, paranoia is paranoia

Ray. Tell that to immigrant workers in the US, Britain, Germany, Israel, New
Zealnd, Australia, Canada: tell the millions whgo were massacred in
Indonesia that there are no classes: tell it to the average Londoner (my
father was from there he knew all about class),tell that to the Chileans,
tell that to the Palestinians who are treated like "niggers" in Israel: but
dont tell that to me I've worked in many many menial jobs and have been in
many struggles and strikes for basic pay. I'm not an academic: I have never
had a "posh" job per se. I live in a working class area: I live the class
struggle. The class struggle is as real as people dying of starvation and
AIDs which they do in nearly every country (maybe every), its as real as
workers in the East working for peanuts to help create Western wealth, its
as real as the homelesss I saw in New York when I visited, its as real as
people in my neighbourhood searching for bargains at the local supermarket,
its as real as the cost of my jeans I last bought, NZ$5.00, and the fact  it
is as real
as a man working overtime in a car factory to get those extra shoes for his
children, its as real as Steinbeck, its as real as Ed Dorn's poetry, or
Bukowski's, its  real, its bloody real, its as real as napalm and jelly
petrol burning children, its as real as nail bombs, its as real as love, its
as real as death. Regards, Richard.

Dear anyone -

I am attempting to locate the source, if possible, of the citation Lorine
Niedecker makes in her short poem "You see here"

You see here
the influence
of inference

Moon on rippled
stream

'Except as
and unless'

So, the closing couplet, which appears to be a citation of some sort.
Perhaps "condensary" suggestions from Zuk?  In any case, would appreciate
any leads back-channel.  Best -

Joe B., you are being purposely ridiculous. There is no *known,
aboveground* porn industry in Afghanistan like there is in the US. And
according to Taliban law, nobody is supposed to grow poppies anymore
either. (Nice bit of pressure from the US, that.) But there are still
opium exports leaving Afghanistan, & I would bet a few of the wealthy
and powerful men have their own stroke books in the mattress. (Never mind how
the burqa laws make all female nakedness pornography. Alan Sondheim? You
done this one yet?)

Even for poor people with sucky healthcare, of whom I am currently one, it
is not ILLEGAL here in the US for a woman to attend a doctor--since women
may not work, under Taliban laws, and no male doctor may examine a female
patient, there are men with force of LAW, albeit sucky law, actively
preventing women from getting seen by doctors in Afghanistan. Of course,
like the probable clandestine porn and the known clandestine opium, there
are clandestine women doctors, barred from working by the Taliban but
still trying to patch up women with what tools and drugs they can get.

YES YES YES, Joe B., the Taliban are like us. The problem is that some of
the ways they are like us are not admirable in either party.

As a side note, I find it politically hilarious that the two women on this
list who have most recently entered the fray and been trashed for it by
several men on this list are me and Marjorie Perloff. To use that grand,
Maya Angelou-vian adjective, our politics are, I believe, unalike (vide
her charmingly risible call for a boycott of the -London Review of Books-
and my own, probably just as risible, agreement with Katha Pollitt on The
Flag Thing).

Igor. You quote me out of context as all political people do with a motive
or pechant for "slanging" ... I was telling people (and as i did I
digressed) about the fact that a New Zealand couple have recently been in
Afghanistan: their reason for being there was that they were combatting or
helping people on drugs there. In the process they found that the people
there (who were obviously mostly of the same faith as the Taleban) were
actually very nice people. Not as rich maybe as your good self but the two
sons found the Afghan boys to be as friendly as New Zealand boys. Their
mother - while clearly not an advocate of Moslemic ways - didnt find living
as a Moslem woman too bad. Now I wasnt making a case for Moslemic
fundamentalism or that Christianity or Afghanistan society is better than
the US or whatever. I am not anti Jewish or anti Moslem or anti any people:
I'm not a relatavist.
   When I say I admire Bin Laden etal: taken against some of the fascist
extremists in Israel he is a pussy cat.  The drug I use is a legal drug
which hardly affects me : valium, although it is highly addictive, I have
been using it since I was 19 that is 34 years.  During that time I have
raised three children and held down various jobs.  I was commenting on the
fact that many people use drugs of some kind and openness about such things
is better than "Oh how terrible.." I have also several convictions for drink
driving which bother me not. I dont go in for the kind of binge drinking I
used to....ok I'm following through with my interest in Lowell Plath etal I
see that Alan Sondheim (in an oblique way) is "nodding" at confessionalism
(and other things)...nor I am I bothered by guilt or worry about anything.
   I liked Catch 22 and I agree with Yossarian that in the long run that
wars are made by the men and women (or whoever) pull the triggers...
  But the problem is that neither you nor I know who actually destroyed the
towers: au conrtraire I dont believe there is one jot of info linking it
with the Taleban.
  I admire them to the extent that they have defeated the USSR (admittedly
with CIA assistance) but to me it would be preferable if the US and Britain
etc and Israel acted like intelligent adults and actually attempted to solve
the CAUSES of terrorism...after all the British went through about 50 years
of it: the world has never been free of terrorism of some kind right back
probably to pre the  stone age.
 I doubt if: if the Israelis retreated back to where they belong (the
borders prior to the 1967 war) and helped the Palestinians set up a state
with UN and all the Arab peoples' cooperation, that terrorism would continue
there (unless generated by agent provocateurs): but the Israeli army are
extremely aggressive: they act like Nazis with the Mossad and the Shin Bet:
and they are constantly buldozing down Palestinian homes, firing missiles
into various countries (usually unprovoked and illegally) as you know there
are extremists elements inside Israel who want to expand outside the present
borders of Israel into Jordan etc....but I'm not saying that all Israelis
are so hateful and so on: Israel is a complex society, a contradictory
society. The trouble is that resentment builds. The more real or perceived
injustices etc by the Israelis the more retaliations and so on and on...and
this is what I admire Bin Laden for: maybe he's no saint but he sees in his
own way these injustices....
  I dont really want any one to "win"...ok I got a bit carried away: I'd
rather see the US do the intelligent thing and turn around and take their
toy planes and ship ships  back home because in the long term they will
create more destruction, more homelessness, more dead, more potential
terrorists. A terrorist is a person driven by anger at injustices to fight
(maybe irrationally but not always) and bring to people in the world a
message "hey! we're hurting over here!"  ...... you Mr Satanovsky ...will
not be any safer at the end of this crazy "charge of the Bush brigade"
toward a lump of sand: the military people will be happy though and the
extreme right wing and the McCarthyists will be in Republican Heaven....I
believe your associates got a huge pay boost for "anti terror
activities"...the US is in a very non-democratic mess...
 But as to my self: its true: sitting behind a keyboard thousands of miles
away so to speak I feel safe. "Its easy for him..." Well it is: precisely.
If I was in the US Army (as one eg) I'd keep my mouth shut...in fact I
admire those who speak and act against this war in your country (which is in
some levels a racist war). I am for freedom: the freedom of countries to
choose their own governmental systems and religions.  I dont think that all
Jewish people agree with your pro war stance.
  But dont think that I am anti Jewish: a young man I liked very very much
was my daughter's boyfriend for some time and is still a friend...I told him
I was more or less anti Zionist but not anti Jewish: the old lady who sells
sunglasses beside me at the market is Jewish: we dont agree on many things
but she is a someone who I would defend and have helped a lot....the Jewish
people have had some of the greatest thinkers and geniuses and their history
has been tragic right back to well at least to the time that King Edward the
First attacked them.and further back...and the Arabs have made their
contributions  - nor am I pro indiscriminate and senseless violent acts by
whoever: the trouble here is what are the causes of "terrorism", how does
one define it, what are the solutions....
  I dont think that it is surprising that the US is under attack by
terrorists but suspect that the attacks originate from within the United
States. (All other cases in US history they have: Kennedy, the terroism by
the Klan against the Blacks AND the Jews in the South, McVeigh and so on...)
The ruling class there badly need a war.
 No, I havent gone too far down any road. I'm always ready to rethink
things: I often "blast from the hip" but at least I say what I think, and I
dont hide who I am: even if I dont think (before) what(?) I say...(!)..touch
of humour there... But we both have our views.  Regards Richard. (real name)

Richard, you better get off whatever drug you take, because you moral
relativism just reached a point of no return. you are right about one
thing â€”
there would never be a military campaign against Taliban just to save
Afghani
women from their inhuman conditions. a sad fact of realpolitik. this war is
not about that.
it's about our self-preservation, our ability to work in tall buildings or
simply being able to check our mail without fear. and it's worth fighting
for. you are safely removed from these realities to sympathize with people
who wants us dead. Al Quada's responsibility for 9/11 is all but admitted,
their symbiosis with the Taliban regime well reported, the new threats are
issued every day. and yes, just like Yossarian fom Catch-22, i take it
personally. they want me dead, because i am jewish; they want me dead
because
i am russian; and they want me dead because i am american. they want you
dead, as well. and if they ever lay their hands on you, should your life be
spared, you will be reading only one book for the rest of yr life, and
forget
what e-mail is. (of course, there will still be a plenty of drugs).
i want people responsible for this act captured or killed, terrorist nests
destroyed, and the advance of Islamic Fashism stopped. if that means
bombings, be it. i don't want to see any "collateral damage", but war is
war.
it's always bloody. and we are not the ones who started it. you are
certainly
attracted to the people with a lot of blood on their hands, so why start
flinching now?

Bad time for Islam-themed stamp

Attacks hurt sale of issue backed by Kentuckian

By Tony Pugh

KNIGHT RIDDER WASHINGTON BUREAU

WASHINGTON -- On Sept. 1, well-wishers in Chicago surrounded Aminah Assilmi
and praised her efforts to secure the nation's first postage stamp honoring
the Muslim faith.

On Sept. 11, the day of terrorist attacks in New York and Washington,
Assilmi was again surrounded -- this time by a group of men in Northern
Kentucky, where she lives. They were shouting anti-Muslim insults and
striking her car with bats.

The fallout from that day has shaken Assilmi, of Taylor Mill. She heads the
International Union of Muslim Women and organized a national campaign that
led to the stamp's creation.

But it might have had a greater impact on the stamp she worked five years to
win.

``It was not just a stamp. It was an expression, a symbol that the Muslim
community is accepted here and Islam is recognized as an American
religion,'' said Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi of Garden Grove, Calif., past
president of the Islamic Society of North America.

In English, the stamp bears the words ``EID Greetings.''

It also features gold Arabic script on a background of navy blue that reads
``EID Mubarak,'' or ``Happy Eid.'' The stamp commemorates Eid ul-Fitr, a
celebration after Ramadan, a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims. The
stamp also honors Eid al-Adha, a festival that marks the end of a hajj, or
pilgrimage to Mecca.

In the weeks following Sept. 11, the EID stamp met with poor sales, and even
provoked anger.

``People have gone into our post offices and said `We shouldn't be selling
that stamp,''' said Dave Failor, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman.

A West Coast radio talk show host even suggested the stamp was rubbing
America's nose in the events of Sept. 11 because EID backward spells
``Die.''

``I must have gotten 19 calls from people who were upset about that,''
Assilmi said. ``There's a large-scale fear of Islam right now. People aren't
sure, so they look at us with an added level of fear.''

Seventy-five million EID stamps were printed, and 45 million shipped. The
stamp went on sale Sept 3. No figures are available, but Failor said it is
selling well in Detroit and Chicago, which have large Muslim communities.

Elsewhere, it hasn't been popular.

``Not at all,'' said Gail Miles, philatelic specialist at the National
Postal Museum in Washington, D.C. ``Everybody says, `If it had come out at
any other time it would be doing well, because it's a pretty stamp.'''

Subject:      Big Oil & Afghanistan
Mime-version: 1.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Ever since the fall of the former Soviet Union ten years ago, Exxon,  Mobi
Chevron and the other big oil monopolies have been scheming to get  their
hands on the vast oil and gas wealth around the Caspian Sea, just  north of
Afghanistan.  This region's oil reserves may reach more than 60  billion
barrels, enough to service Europ's oil needs for 11 years.   Some
estimates are as high as 200 billion barrels.  The Caspian Sea  reserves are
10 percent of the world's known supply, worth about $5  trillion at today's
prices.

In February 1998, Unocal Corporation testified to the House Committee on
Internal Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific that the =B3Taliban
government in Afghanistan is an obstacle to having an oil pipeline from
the Caspian region to the Indian Ocean, that is, through Afghanistan.   In
1997, Unocal even tried to woo the Taliban with billions of dollars to
support the proposed pipeline through their country. The unrecognized
Taliban government, however, was a set back to their plans.

Having a government in Afghanistan that is beholden to U.S. interests,
along with stationing U.S. troops in the former Soviet Republics of
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, would secure the region and allow
this project to proceed.  And just in time, as far as the U.S. oil
companies are concerned, because there is international competition for the
Caspian Sea oil resources.

 Russia and German companies had been trying to establish a pipeline from
the Caspian Sea through Eastern Europe, but U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia
blocked this plan.  Russia, however, also brokered a treaty with Iran for a
pipeline route.  China also began negotiating to build oil and gas
pipelines from Kazakhstan.  In January 2001, oil industry journals  lamented
that any chance the U.S. had of cementing alliances in the  region seemed
doomed.  They noted, however, that the incoming Bush  administration, heavy
in oil and related interests, would likely try to  reverse this trend
(www.caucasuswatch.com).

_______________:

Moreover, the Taliban itself is a creation of the Americans and the
British.

In the 1980s, the tribal army that produced them was funded by the CIA and
trained by the SAS to fight the Russians.

The hypocrisy does not stop there. When the Taliban took Kabul in 1996,
Washington said nothing. Why? Because Taliban leaders were soon on their
way to Houston, Texas, to be entertained by executives of the oil company,
Unocal.

With secret US government approval, the company offered them a generous
cut of the profits of the oil and gas pumped through a pipeline that the
Americans wanted to build from Soviet central Asia through Afghanistan.

A US diplomat said: "The Taliban will probably develop like the Saudis
did." He explained that Afghanistan would become an American oil colony,
there would be huge profits for the West, no democracy and the legal
persecution of women. "We can live with that," he said.

Although the deal fell through, it remains an urgent priority of the
administration of George W. Bush, which is steeped in the oil industry.
Bush's concealed agenda is to exploit the oil and gas reserves in the
Caspian basin, the greatest source of untapped fossil fuel on earth and
enough, according to one estimate, to meet America's voracious energy
needs for a generation. Only if the pipeline runs through Afghanistan can
the Americans hope to control it.

So, not surprisingly, US Secretary of State Colin Powell is now referring
to "moderate" Taliban, who will join an American-sponsored "loose
federation" to run Afghanistan. The "war on terrorism" is a cover for
this: a means of achieving American strategic aims that lie behind the
flag-waving facade of great power.

The Royal Marines, who will do the real dirty work, will be little more
than mercenaries for Washington's imperial ambitions, not to mention the
extraordinary pretensions of Blair himself. Having made Britain a target
for terrorism with his bellicose "shoulder to shoulder" with Bush
nonsense, he is now prepared to send troops to a battlefield where the
goals are so uncertain that even the Chief of the Defence Staff says the
conflict "could last 50 years".

The irresponsibility of this is breathtaking; the pressure on Pakistan
alone could ignite an unprecedented crisis across the Indian
sub-continent. Having reported many wars, I am always struck by the
absurdity of effete politicians eager to wave farewell to young soldiers,
but who themselves would not say boo to a Taliban goose.

In the days of gunboats, our imperial leaders covered their violence in
the "morality" of their actions. Blair is no different. Like them, his
selective moralising omits the most basic truth. Nothing justified the
killing of innocent people in America on September 11, and nothing
justifies the killing of innocent people anywhere else.

By killing innocents in Afghanistan, Blair and Bush stoop to the level of
the criminal outrage in New York. Once you cluster bomb, "mistakes" and
"blunders" are a pretence. Murder is murder, regardless of whether you
crash a plane into a building or order and collude with it from the Oval
Office and Downing Street.

If Blair was really opposed to all forms of terrorism, he would get
Britain out of the arms trade. On the day of the twin towers attack, an
"arms fair", selling weapons of terror (like cluster bombs and missiles)
to assorted tyrants and human rights abusers, opened in London's Docklands
with the full backing of the Blair government.

If he really wanted to demonstrate "the moral fibre of Britain", Blair
would do everything in his power to lift the threat of violence in those
parts of the world where there is great and justifiable grievance and
anger.

He would do more than make gestures; he would demand that Israel ends its
illegal occupation of Palestine and withdraw to its borders prior to the
1967 war, as ordered by the Security Council, of which Britain is a
permanent member.

He would call for an end to the genocidal blockade which the UN - in
reality, America and Britain - has imposed on the suffering people of Iraq
for more than a decade, causing the deaths of half a million children
under the age of five.

That's more deaths of infants every month than the number killed in the
World Trade Center.

There are signs that Washington is about to extend its current "war" to
Iraq; yet unknown to most of us, almost every day RAF and American
aircraft already bomb Iraq. There are no headlines. There is nothing on
the TV news. This terror is the longest-running Anglo-American bombing
campaign since World War Two.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and Britain faced a "dilemma"
in Iraq, because "few targets remain". "We're down to the last outhouse,"
said a US official. That was two years ago, and they're still bombing. The
cost to the British taxpayer? 800 million pounds so far.

According to an internal UN report, covering a five-month period, 41 per
cent of the casualties are civilians. In northern Iraq, I met a woman
whose husband and four children were among the deaths listed in the
report. He was a shepherd, who was tending his sheep with his elderly
father and his children when two planes attacked them, each making a
sweep. It was an open valley; there were no military targets nearby.

"I want to see the pilot who did this," said the widow at the graveside of
her entire family. For them, there was no service in St Paul's Cathedral
with the Queen in attendance; no rock concert with Paul McCartney.

The tragedy of the Iraqis, and the Palestinians, and the Afghanis is a
truth that is the very opposite of their caricatures in much of the
Western media.

Far from being the terrorists of the world, the overwhelming majority of
the Islamic peoples of the Middle East and south Asia have been its
victims - victims largely of the West's exploitation of precious natural
resources in or near their countries.

There is no war on terrorism. If there was, the Royal Marines and the SAS
would be storming the beaches of Florida, where more CIA-funded
terrorists, ex-Latin American dictators and torturers, are given refuge
than anywhere on earth. . .

It has come to my sober attention that American Poetry (free and how), by
Igor Satanovsky, has just been published by Koja Press.  And an absolutely
fabulous collection it is, filled with visual poetries, collaborations, and
Igor's own unique brand of re-cuts.  Highly recommended.  Koja Press
specializes in authors who cannot easily be labeled -- neither traditional
lyrical-narrative nor language/code.  Can't fight the future!!  Best, Bill

    Enclosed is another review of Pedra Canga by Tereza Albues, this =
time in the form
    of a column-essay by Raleigh (North Carolina) News & Observer editor =
J. Peder Zane:
    =20
    =20
    Why do they hate us?
         Why do ragged and raging mobs burn our flag while chanting =
"Death to America"? Why do so many of their governments and leading =
newspapers peddle outrageous conspiracy theories, including the idea =
that Israel carried out the September 11th attacks?
         Like many Ameriacans, I have looked for answers in books about =
Islam and the Arab world. However, learning about their history and our =
policies only takes us so far. Bare facts and cold analysis tend to make =
human actions seem rational. But the blind hatred we are witnessing is =
not the product of reason. To deny this would be tantamount to casting =
the virulent racism that long gripped our nation as a sensible =
action--after all, slavery and the Indian wars did provide great =
benefits to white Americans.
         I mention our own terribly familiar history for two reasons. =
First, it reminds us that the madness we are witnessing in the Muslim =
world is not a new or peculiar phenomenon. More important, the interplay =
between delusion and self-interest that shaped our past highlights the =
paradox we now face: How do we comprehend the twisted logic that informs =
vast swaths of the Muslim world without raising it to the level of =
rationality? History and journalism can help us explore this question, =
but literature is also essential. For it revolves not so much around =
facts as around the stories people tell about those facts. Just as =
antebellum Americans created elaborate myths to justify slavery, many =
Muslims have concocted bizarre narratives to explain their world.
         One of the best books I've read on the logic of irrationality =
is Tereza Albues' recently translated 1987 novel about a small Brazilian =
town, Pedra Canga (Green Integer, $12.95, paper, 153 pages, translated =
from the Portuguese by Clifford E. Landers). It is a superb work of =
magic realism that reveals the especially strong role that false =
stories, supersition and myth play in the lives of the powerless, =
beleaguered and uninformed. Like William Faulkner and Gabriel Gracia =
Marquez, Albues shows us how essential storytelling is to the human =
experience, how the need for explanation is never deterred by the =
absence of knowledge. Pedra Canga is remote, yet its isolation and want =
would be achingly familiar to many in the undeveloped world. Its =
residents "came from extremely poor families, were undernourished, and =
lived in mud shacks--many people, little food, no comfort, great =
suffering, no future," Albues writes. "They learned at an early age to =
fend for themselves. No one told them what to do. They did as they =
pleased, pursuing fantasies. Whatever rules they followed were their =
own, created by themselves." Like many who share the common bond of =
poverty, the residents of Pedra Canga found unity in a common enemy: the =
rich and powerful family who dominates their world, the Vergares, and =
that family's estate, the Mangueiral. The estate was "surrounded by high =
walls topped with broken glass...thick barbed wire...[and] =
alligators.... The estate had plants of every kind: oranges, bananas, =
manioc, squash, potatoes, cashews... The fruits ripened, fell to the =
ground, rotted without being touched. An insult! Especially =
[since]...the majority of people in Pedra Canga...[had] barely enough =
for their daily rice and beans."
         Pedra Canga is a literary detective story. Our narrator, =
Tereza, is inquiring about the death of the Vergares' patriarch, Mr. V., =
17 years ago. Instead of moving ever closer to the truth, Tereza learns =
that rumor, fable and fact are interchangeable in Pedra Canga. As she =
interviews the townspeople--including Smoking Snakes, Ezekiel the Hermit =
and Marcola, the town's mystic--she learns not only of the Vergares' =
dark past but she also hears spine-tingling tales of murder, torture and =
screams in the night, of a virgin pig that became pregnant and a man who =
was slave to his own father.=20
         Most of all she learns of the Evil One, the spirit who fills =
the air of Pedra Canga. Like the townspeople's other confabulations, the =
might Evil One embodies the deepest truth of their lives--their =
powerlessness, the sense that forces far stronger than they rule their =
world. As Tereza delves deeper into her mystery, another character tells =
her that she will never find the truth she seeks because only myth can =
provide reasonable explanations to the people of Pedra Canga: "[They] =
always looked upon that house as a symbol of hidden forces, arrogance, =
and evildoing, both because of the Vergares' past and because no one had =
access to the Mangueiral. ...The Vergares were very powerful. ....It's =
natural that...they create myths and attribute to the supernatural any =
fact that, in different circumstances, would be nothing but a =
commonplace. It's a way of their feeling avenged, or compensated, if you =
prefer."
         As we confront a world gone mad, Pedra Canga may guide us =
toward the answers we seek. It reminds us that storytelling is both an =
essential vehicle of human understanding and a profoundly neutral =
phenomena--it is shaped as easily by falsehood as by truth. As we try to =
decode the tales that many Muslims are telling themselves, we should =
remember that stories can thrive in the clearest light and the darkest =
night, that hatred and fear possess a logic which is not reason.  =

Gwyn, Jennifer, Pam,

My point was not to deny abuses of human rights by the Taliban and others,
nor to deny that attention has been paid in such outlets as the ad-free
Ms. and elsewhere.  My point was that the mainstream media attention is
being paid to them now (and previous to S11, since bin Laden was on our
enemies list before) because of a concrete policy objective on the part of
the US.  Human rights, in and of themselves, are rarely covered by our
isolationist mass media.  So when they are, be sure that what is intended
is manipulation--yes, even by the facts--and not information.  (And
Jennifer, I think you make exactly this point...except I would not say
that it was "ironic" but rather expected.)

analysis

a repeated sort in this instance is made by sort file1 > file2 - at which
point file2 is justified; then file2 > file1 - at which point file1 is
justified. this repeats - not indefinitely (although i have no proof of
this) - until stasis is achieved - i.e. file1 = file2.

the sort is alphabetic; therefore the concepts - which are similar to
kantian or aristotelian categories - are organized accordingly in
alphabetic order. this transforms the concepts - which presumably have
their own, implicit, order - into associations based on explicit happen-
stance. the result is an apparent relativization of conceptation, based on
nothing more than english (in this sense it is similar to some of the
logical paradoxes of the early 20th-century which 'resolved' in terms of
one or another language).

further, if the concepts are indeed foundational in any sense whatsoever -
then any ordering is as good as any other, since they would be intrinsic-
ally independent. the associative complexes formed by repeated sorting
would be the result of a dialectic of perception between the reader and
the text, which is more a collocation or inscriptive apparatus - a search
engine in the sense of a spider, across and throughout the real and all
its appurtenances.

finally, a certain biologism is apparent in the list - ranging from 'i'
and consciousness through 'self' and 'self-awareness'; this brings to
light a certain reduction or veering of conceptation towards an organic
reading - i.e. heuristics or methodologies for making sense of the world,
ranging from retinal processing through naming, inscription, referent, and
truth. this is also at variance with a classical condition of independence
- in this case, the variance is from within the list, intrinsic to it (the
list at this point conjuring up classical cybernetics as well), not
extrinsic - a deeper waywardness, redolent of desire, than alphabetic
ordering would create.

analysis^2

meta-analysis or the need for compensation, sublimation exacting an
equivalence somewhere down the line or loosely across the plane. all of
these are open moments - 'well, i'll explain myself,' 'well, i meant such
and such' - and in relation to legitimacy. see analysis^2 as a thwarted
series; the idea, that of recursion as in gnu - gnu not unix - and hack -
tends either towards the asymptotic - 'well, i don't know,' 'well, it
might have been' - or towards a foreclosure or basin - 'well, you've got
enough to go on,' 'well, you don't care anyway.' then in any case, an
apologetics of writing, writing in an n-dimensional space, writing to
oneself, extending the skein or membrane, trapping others -

Subject:      Kazakh Oil
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Dear Cris -- I think your oil pipeline information is out of date and
no longer relevant. Check out these two much more recent reports from
the New York Times. It seems that the pipeline passage of Kazakh oil
through Russia is imminent and through Turkey a possibility. An
Afghanistan-Indian Ocean route has no backing and is not part of the
picture. It's absurd to imagine that Bush would go up against Chevron
for Kazakh oil, since Chevron is already committed to a pipeline
through Russia to Novorossysk on the Black Sea and has been committed
to it $2.6 billion worth for the last 9 years.

Oil is not the reason for the attack on Afghanistan. You
underestimate the stupidity of the US government and its commitment
to domestic public relations.

A Breakthrough for Kazakhstan's Oil
By BIRGIT BRAUER

10/02/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2001 New York Times Company
ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Oct. 1 -- Nine long years after a consortium was
formed to build it, a $2.6 billion pipeline from the Tengiz oil field in
western Kazakhstan to Novorossiysk, a Russian port on the Black Sea, is
finally ready to begin operating. Oil will start flowing in the next few
days, bound for customers in the Mediterranean and Western Europe.
Although the timing is awkward, the pipeline is a major breakthrough for
the country, where immense reserves of oil have been found, but in
remote locations far from a pipeline or seaport that could bring the oil
to market efficiently. And it is a breakthrough for Tengizchevroil, a
joint venture led by Chevron that is developing the giant Tengiz field.
Before the pipeline, the only ways to ship bulk oil exports from
Kazakhstan to customer nations were in rail cars through the creaky
Russian railway system or by boat across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan.
These were expensive and a logistical headache. And they limited the
amount of oil that could be produced by Tengizchevroil and rival oil
operators.
With the new pipeline and other development projects like the Kashagan
offshore field, Kazakhstan hopes to more than double its output, to 2
million barrels a day in 2010, from 840,000 barrels a day this year,
furthering its ambition to become one of the world's top five oil
producers. Although there is short-term concern about an oil glut as
most big economies around the world slow, most analysts agree that in
the long term, Kazakhstan will find demand for all that oil and more.
The pipeline promises to be a big cost saver for Tengizchevroil, which
has grown since its creation in 1993 to become Kazakhstan's largest
single producer at 260,000 barrels a day, or 12 million tons a year.
''The savings of the pipeline will be about $25 per ton,'' said Tom
Winterton, general director of the Tengizchevroil venture. ''At a
million tons a month, you can see pretty substantial savings.''
Tengizchevroil is mainly American-owned; Chevron has half; Exxon Mobil
has one-quarter; a Russian partnership, LukArco, holds another 5
percent; and the Kazakhstan government owns the other 20 percent. It is
one of the largest employers in the region, with 3,200 workers. The
latest phase of expansion, undertaken to take advantage of the pipeline,
will raise its total investment to $4 billion.
The 980-mile pipeline was built by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which originally included the governments of Russia, Kazakhstan and
Oman. The group quickly fell to infighting, and it was restructured in
1996 to include foreign oil companies. But the project made little
headway until 1999, when the Russian prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov,
decided to back it as furthering Russia's national interest.
Red tape and squabbling within the consortium, and efforts by Russian
regional governments to enlarge their cut of the pipeline's revenue,
have repeatedly held up completion. Even now there is not yet a firm
start date. Still, all concerned say oil will flow in October, and once
it does, many say the intramural wrangling will fade.
''This is a high-profile project,'' said Laurent Ruseckas, director of
Caspian research at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting
firm. ''It's really going to be in Russia's interest to see it work
smoothly.''
Central Asia is a tense and uncertain region in the wake of the
terrorist attacks in the United States. Though Iran has scuffled with
its neighbors over offshore rights in the Caspian Sea, and Afghanistan
is not very far off, oil executives in the area say they see little
added threat to the safety of oil operations after Sept. 11.
''The most impact, in all honesty, is going to be that it has
accelerated this move into recessionary pressures,'' Mr. Winterton said.
''That, undoubtedly, will have some longer-term impact on growth.''
For the moment, though, engineering work will go ahead on
Tengizchevroil's expansion plans even if economic conditions sour in the
short term, he said, with a decision to be made about a year from now on
how quickly to proceed with construction.

The head of Kazakhstan's national oil company Kazakhoil, Nurlan
Balgimbayev, left, says a 1,040-mile pipeline to be built from Baku, the
capital of Azerbaijan, to the Turkish port city of Ceyhan on the
Mediterranean will not be viable without the addition of Kazakh oil.
While investors in the proposed one-million-barrel-a-day pipeline
project, supported by the United States, have started a $120 million
detailed engineering study, the Kazakh government has been working since
this spring on putting together a sponsors' group of local and foreign
oil companies operating in Kazakhstan. Birgit Brauer (NYT)

Last August I spent a camping trip reading *Women of the Left Bank* (which I
would highly recommend to anyone interested in same, tho you may want to
skip some parts, as when plots of books you haven't read are given away, in
my case H.D.'s *Hermione*). Toward the end, it's all about everyone's
reaction (practical & literary) to the beginning of WWII and I remember
lazily thinking under some big tree in Washington state, it's so strange to
imagine being that truly *caught* in history. And now, here we are (tho of
course I am not nearly as *caught* as a no doubt wide variety of folks in
NYC, Pennsylvania, Washington DC, & Afghanistan).

Paula Gunn Allen came and spoke at Small Press Traffic on Oct. 19. She
talked about lots of things, including Indigenous nations' reactions to
current events. She talked about how the earth is going through some kind of
menopause which sounds ludicrous coming from me but you should read her
essay "Growing Up Sacred" which she wrote for a book of photographs of
sacred places in the US just published (she couldn't remember the title of
the book, a coffee table sort I imagine, which charmed me being deeply
marked by her work as a critic and as a teacher of mine at UCB). She was
lucky enough to grow up with a Scots-Irish Laguna Pueblo mother who read the
kids Gertrude Stein aloud and told them to look at the mountain. Also a
Lebanese father, which gives some twists to her take on the events. She read
some updated transliterations of Rumi poems which pleased the crowd. MP3s of
her talk and also some other great recent SPT readings by Stephanie Williams
and Lily James should be up at our website (http://www.sptraffic.org) fairly

International Gathering of Hope

November 11

As we recover from the tragic events of September
11th and ponder the widening war, we have a unique
opportunity to break this vicious cycle of violence
and inspire the world with a message of unity,
healing, and peace.

On November 11, the two-month anniversary of the
tragedy at the World Trade Center, and the 83rd
anniversary of the end of WW1, New York City will
come together in a Gathering of Hope, to begin at
4:00pm at the Hope Garden in BATTERY PARK.

We will first gather in the park with music and
performance, dance, festivity, and free food; a
showing of unity and hope in the face of adversity.
After, we will proceed uptown along the footpath, a
sea of light collecting at the base of the fallen
towers.

As symbols of compassion for victims of violence
and poverty the world over we ask that people wear
an element of white as a symbol of peace, and bring
flowers, candles, and hand-made lanterns to lay
beside the ashes of the World Trade Center.

This is a global issue. Communities the world over
are joining in this powerful symbolic act.

ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE.

http://www.gatheringofhope.org
800/450-5456

--------------------------------------

--  This is an international event. Across the
planet people are claiming November 11 as a day of
hope, a day to celebrate our belief that peace and
justice can heal our wounded world.

--  The effort is led by artists seeking creative
ways to inspire and educate.

--  We welcome artists and people the world over to
do something in their own communities on this day.

--  The event is in concert with worldwide
demonstrations that week calling for global
economic justice.

In New York City on November 11th:

--  Participants are making hundreds of hand-made
lanterns to be laid at the foot of the fallen
towers in the shape of the word "HOPE"

--  Scores of dancers, performers and musicians
will hold a festival of hope and possibility in
Battery Park.

--  We will be distributing literature detailing
positive, sustainable alternatives to military and
economic violence.

--  Our promotional and informational materials are
available for distribution to anyone in the world.

      there are orders and orderings, and there are viral disruptions

       and collapse it, abjectly

         awake, i attempt the long or philosophic form, fleeing the

            broken against the furious assault of language

            irrelevance of the body, enormous sheaves of texts, files
             and circulations, routings of collapsed desire, outlines
             and articulations

             careful display and explication of theoretical work in
              every state of development, ultimately the style of

               continuous maintenance of worlds, worlding through text

Forgive the double announcement!  I want to write a little bit about
our upcoming play, "The American Objectivists," written by myself &
Brian Kim Stefans.  We have been rehearsing this week and I am quite
confident you've never seen anything exactly like it!  Our cast is
divided into two groups, one half knew all about the Objectivists
already, and the others I think believed that they were going to be
acting out the life of Ayn Rand and her circle.  But now, we're all
on the same page.

Please try to come to its premiere (if you're in San Francisco) this
Sunday, November 11th.  It will be part of "LUCKY 7," the annual
benefit for Small Press Traffic, from 1 to 5 p.m. at CCAC (California
College of Arts and Crafts), 1111 Eighth Street at Wisconsin off 16th
Street in the Mission. First we will have a nice cocktail type hour
thing with Wayne Smith performing his own music.  Then I will be the
auctioneer for this year's exciting crop of literary memorabilia and
manuscripts.  As usual we have everything under the sun, the bad and
the beautiful, including material from Edward Albee, John Ashbery,
Paul Auster, Bjork, Joe Brainard, John Cage, Anne Carson, Clark
Coolidge, Agnes de Mille, Jerome Robbins, Vaclav Havel, Tippi Hedren,
James Merrill, Henry Miller, Czeslaw Milosz, Marianne Moore, Alice
Notley, Doug Oliver, Carl Rakosi, Adrienne Rich, Laura (Riding)
Jackson, James Schuyler, May Sinclair, Zadie Smith, Steven
Soderbergh, Derek Walcott, John Waters, Jeanette Winterson, Slavoj
Zizek, and tons more.  (Catalogue on request as usual.)

And then, our play!  So, the benefit starts at 1, around 2:30 we'll
have the auction, and the play will start around 3:45 or 4.  It will
all be over around 5 and it costs only TEN DOLLARS!  Hope to see you
all there!  For more information call (415) 551-9278.

Thank you everybody, hope to see you on November 11th (this Sunday),
help support a good cause and have lots of fun!!  -- Kevin Killian.

Hello,

My philosophy when teaching introductory creative writing courses is to run
them as reading/writing seminars, i.e. I have the students read a lot of
literature and respond to it rather than just "workshopping." All the
creative writing textbooks I have are either dull or ridiculous, but I'm
wondering if there are any "How to" books -- for either poetry or prose --
that you have found useful for young college writers.

Also, of the books on poetics, versification, form, etc. which have you
found useful in the classroom?

Thanks in advance for your recommendations,
Kathy Lou

Bioterrorism's Biggest Threat May Be to Mental, Not Physical, Health

While America attempts to adjust to its new status as a target of =
terrorist activity, experts gathered on Capitol Hill to discuss whether =
the steps currently being taken will prepare us for the next attack and =
how Americans will cope mentally if the attacks continue.

Speaking at the meeting convened by the National Health Policy Forum, =
Assistant Surgeon General, Brian W. Flynn, Ed.D., described the various =
mental health issues that can be expected to arise due to recent events. =
Psychological problems, specifically post-traumatic stress disorder, =
that result from terrorist attacks tend to be more serious, more =
complicated and longer lasting than the types of problems that arise =
after natural disasters.=20

"Anthrax is not contagious," he noted, "but fear is."

Many mental health professionals made themselves available in the =
aftermath of the September 11 traumas, but few are trained specifically =
to deal with this type of traumatic experience.  Combine this =
shortcoming with the fact that many suffering from post-traumatic stress =
symptoms never seek assistance, then add in a growing number of =
bioterrorist events (both real incidents and hoaxes), and you have the =
makings of a poorly-controlled mental health epidemic.

Flynn points out that researchers have learned much about mental =
illness, but little is known about mental health. The bioterrorism-mind =
connection "is far more about mental health than mental illness," he =
says, referring to the fact that researchers need to understand what =
helps people come through these types of events without emotional scars.

Zohra Saed, an Afghan poet and editor and doctoral
student at CUNY, has been editing over the past year
an anthology of Afghan-American writings. Though the
book was finished, they are now adding additional
writings dealing with 9/11.

She's actually now trying to find a publisher for the
book quickly. It's amazing writing, and I hope anyone
with leads for her to query will e-mail me, or her at
ZSaed@gc.cuny.edu.

Thanks,

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I have a friend who is curious how possible it is to get a job teaching
college-level creative writing with an MFA gained through one of those "low
residence" programs offered by various schools (where you take classes over
a couple of summers or whatever).  She mainly writes fiction, but she asked
me if I would send the question out to the poetics list in hopes that some
people might have a broad familiarity with the CW industry.

If anyone out there is knowledgeable about this stuff (what combination of
publications/educational background etc. is minimally requisite on average,
what some typical hiring statistics are in the field, and so on), I'd
appreciate a b/c reply.

Thanks,

Kasey

What bin Laden and Bush Don't Talk About: The Politics of Oil
Michael T. Klare, <A HREF="http://www.alternet.org/">AlterNet</A>
November 5, 2001

Osama bin Laden does not talk about oil when he calls for a holy war against
the enemies of Islam. Neither does George Bush, when he calls for a global
war against terrorism. Both major protagonists in the current conflict stress
moral and religious themes in their public pronouncements, claiming that this
is a struggle between good and evil. But both bin Laden and Bush are well
aware that the conflict also represents a struggle for control over the
greater Persian Gulf region -- the location of about two-thirds of the
world's known petroleum reserves. One can view the current conflict between
the United States and Osama bin Laden's global terror network on a number of
levels: as a struggle over the role of Islam in the modern world; as a fight
between Islamic fundamentalists and less doctrinaire, Western-backed
governments in the region; and as an inevitable consequence of America's
continuing support for Israel. But however useful these strands of analysis,
it is not possible to fully appreciate the origins and significance of the
conflict without considering the historic role of oil politics. The greater
Gulf area (encompassing Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and several adjacent countries) has been a major international
battleground ever since oil was discovered there in the early years of the
20th century. At first it was Great Britain that fought to gain control over
the area's petroleum wealth, with a particular focus on the oil reserves of
Persia (renamed Iran in 1935). Later France moved into the area, seeking
control over the reserves in Iraq. Further north, in the Caspian Sea basin,
Czarist Russia and then the Soviet Union established a significant foothold
in the oil-rich Baku area (now a part of Azerbaijan). Since World War II, the
United States has been the dominant outside power in the greater Gulf area,
with a significant presence in Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates. American involvement started in March 1945, when President Franklin
D. Roosevelt met with King Abdel Aziz ibn Saud, the founder of the modern
Saudi regime, and forged a long-lasting strategic partnership. Although
details of the Roosevelt-Abdel Aziz agreement have never been made public,
the basic outlines of the deal are widely known: in return for privileged
U.S. access to Saudi oil, the United States agreed to protect the royal
family against both external and internal threats. To fulfill its side of the
bargain, the United States has provided Saudi Arabia with billions of dollars
worth of modern weapons, has trained and advised the Saudi army and
paramilitary police, and, since 1990, has deployed large numbers of American
combat personnel in the kingdom. This relationship has provided both parties
with multiple benefits. The United States has enjoyed favored access to Saudi
Arabia's immense oil reserves and earned many billions of dollars from the
sale of advanced weapons and other high-tech systems to the Saudi government.
The Saudi monarchy, for its part, has accumulated immense wealth from the
sale of oil and enjoyed relative immunity from foreign or domestic attack. In
recent years, however, both sides have attracted considerable hostility from
militant Islamists because of their close relationship with one another. The
royal family has attracted hostility because it is so closely tied with the
United States, which in turn is associated with Israel and the repression of
the Palestinians, and because it has allowed non-Muslim American soldiers --
infidels, as seen by their detractors -- to reside in the country (which is
viewed as the Muslim holy land because of its historic role in the life of
Mohammed). The United States, for its part, is condemned for aiding Israel
and for helping to keep the Saudi monarchy in power. It is from this cauldron
of contending forces that Osama bin Laden's network has emerged. Once a
privileged member of the Saudi elite, bin Laden has become its most dedicated
opponent. (Fifteen of the 19 terrorists involved in the Sept. 11 attacks were
also recruited in Saudi Arabia.) Ultimately, bin Laden seeks to drive the
United States out of the kingdom and replace the monarchy with a Taliban-like
fundamentalist regime. And because he lacks the armies to accomplish this
aim, he has relied on recurring acts of sabotage and terrorism. The United
States has been fighting this threat since the early 1990s, when bin Laden
first announced a jihad against America and initiated his first acts of
terrorism. This has involved stepped-up security procedures at American
embassies and military bases in the Middle East and elsewhere, and often
secret efforts to track down and arrest bin Laden's associates. The Clinton
administration also launched missile attacks against bin Laden's Afghan
headquarters following the 1998 terrorist strikes at U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania. Through all of this, the United States has sought to preserve
friendly ties with the Saudi monarchy, now headed by King Fahd. (Day-to-day
control is exercised by Crown Prince Abdullah, however, because Fahd is
seriously ill.) But friendly ties have become increasingly difficult, because
the royal family faces growing opposition at home and thus seeks to distance
itself from Washington. As a result, Riyadh (the Saudi capital) has been slow
to provide U.S. investigators with information on the terrorists involved in
the Sept. 11 attacks and to cut off funds to religious charities linked to
bin Laden's terror network. At no point, however, has the United States
considered reducing its dependence on Middle Eastern oil or in altering its
relationship with Saudi Arabia. Indeed, the national energy policy released
by the Bush administration last spring called for a steady increase in U.S.
petroleum imports from Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf suppliers. For this
reason, the report notes, "The Gulf will be a primary focus of U.S.
international energy policy." But U.S. officials also seek to diversify the
sources of imported energy, so as to compensate for any future interruption
in the delivery of Gulf oil. This has led to growing U.S. interest in the oil
and natural gas reserves of the Caspian Sea basin, especially those of
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. (All told, these
countries are believed to possess some 200 billion barrels of oil, or about
one-third the amount found in the Persian Gulf area.) These countries, too,
face a threat from Islamic extremists supported by Osama bin Laden and his Al
Qaeda terror network. It is not surprising, then, that U.S. troops have
conducted joint military exercises with forces from many of these countries.
It is against this backdrop that the events of Sept. 11 and thereafter must
be viewed. Although Osama bin Laden is not directly concerned with the flow
of oil from the Gulf and the Caspian Sea area, his determination to drive the
United States out of the area and replace existing governments with militant
Islamic regimes represents a direct threat to American oil interests in the
region. Thus, in fighting Al Qaeda, the United States has two sets of
objectives: first, to capture and punish those responsible for the Sept. 11
attacks, and to prevent further acts of terrorism; and second, to consolidate
American power in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea area and to ensure the
continued flow of oil. And while the second set may get far less public
attention than the first, this does not mean that it is any less important.
What are the implications of this for future U.S. policy? The American public
rightfully wants to see Osama bin Laden brought to justice and his worldwide
terror network eradicated. This must be the immediate goal of American
foreign policy. But once this has been accomplished, the United States should
reassess the risks and benefits of growing U.S. oil dependence from greater
Gulf area, and consider whether it might be appropriate to, in time, reduce
U.S. military presence there. Surely, the last thing we need is an endless
series of wars over access to Persian Gulf oil. Michael T. Klare is a
professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College in
Amherst, Mass., and the author of "Resource Wars: The New Landscape of Global
Conflict" (Metropolitan Books, 2001).

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

A special evening with
ALICE NOTLEY

Saturday November 10
7:30 pm, free
@ The Ira & Lenore S. Gershwin Theater
2350 Turk Boulevard (near Masonic)

presented in collaboration with Readings at Lone Mountain,
the M.F.A. Writing Program at the University of San Francisco

ALICE NOTLEY returns to San Francisco for a solo reading at the beautiful
Gershwin Theater (admission is free).  Ms. Notley's work as a poet over the
past three decades presents one of the great adventures of contemporary
American poetry.  Her newest book, Disobedience, just out from Penguin,
follows Mysteries of Small Houses, Close to me...& Closer (The Language of
Heaven) and D=E9sam=E8re, and The Descent of Alette, in its radical breaking
loose from conventions and presumptive practices, opening poetry to its
possibilities for unforeseen vision.  'The first sentence (of my poem) must
be "I left it."'  (from "Change the Forms in Dreams," Disobedience).
Please join us for this truly special evening of poetry in the American
grain, as Ms. Notley visits from her present home in Paris, France.

"I seem to start with my poem The Descent of Alette these days, whatever it
is that I am now seems to start there.  It was for me an immense act of
rebellion against dominant social forces, against the fragmented forms of
modern poetry, against the way a poem was supposed to look according to
both past and contemporary practice.  It begins in pieces and ends whole,
narrated by an I who doesn't know her name and whose name when she finds it
means appendage of a male name; her important name is I.  I stand with
this, and with the urgency that saying I creates, a facing up to sheer
presence, death and responsibility, the potential for blowing away all the
gauze."

Thanks, Joe for the more on the Oil connection. I would just add an
addendum about Latin American, particularly the oil reserves in Mexico
and Venezuela.

Even though U.S. foreign policy makers had hoped that with the election
of Vincente Fox that Pemex, the huge national Mexican oil combine, would
move rapidly toward privatization e.g. more economic and political
control by the international oil companies and the U.S. for the most
part this has not occurred.

More ominous is Venezuela, where the populist Hugo Chavez has launched
policies designed to help the people of Venezuela (see article below)
rather the usual constituents of greed there and in western capital
markets all over the world. Toward disrupting this "threat of a good
example", the U.S. has thrown tens of millions of U.S. taxpayer money at
Venezuela's historically corrupt oligarchy. Much of that money simply
disappears into private bank accounts. Our home town, Washington DC,
which is referred to as "Hollywood for the ugly", is full of these
corrupt stooges either living out their days or waiting to return when
the U.S. needs another puppet regime.

Also, pressure is being applied on Venezuela through Colombia. U.S.
funding of 'death squads' and paramilitaries in Colombia parallels
traditional modes of 'legal' and illegal support. The little
facilitating firms run mostly by retired U.S. military across the river
in Northern Virginia are burning the midnight oil forging end user
certificates and lining up weapons, transport and high tech surveillance
equipment for the more brutal elements in the Colombian military and the
right wing death squads. Meanwhile, the Washington Post continues to
insist that the financial support is coming from 'wealthy' ranchers in
Colombia. Do the math. This threat from Colombia is being held over the
head of the Chavez government. Go to far with reform especially as
regards oil and we'll press our case that you are harboring the FARC and
create a conflagration that will make Nicaragua (and Iran contra) look
like the dress rehearsal it was. Even with widespread malnutrition and
starvation, the Sandinistas cannot win an election against a corrupt
oligarchy, that's how brutalized that country's people were by the
U.S.'s proxy war. Think how more violent Washington's fury is where
their largest supplier of oil, Venezuela, is concerned. And we haven't
even mentioned the "other oil", another market coveted by U.S. and
international business and banking interests. Just ask Citibank. CP

                  and the Transformation of Venezuela

                  There is a huge social experiment underway in
Venezuela and few on the
                  American left seem to be paying attention. The
military is buying fresh
                  vegetables and meat in the countryside and trucking it
to poor neighborhoods
                  for sale at subsidized markets. New state run
pharmacies are selling medicine at
                  a 30% discount. The government now provides breakfast
and lunch to children
                  at school, which helped boost enrollment by one
million over the last year.
                  These are just a few of the social reforms began two
years ago with the election
                  of the left-leaning president, Hugo Chavez. The new
leader is also trying to trim
                  the fat of corruption and graft within the government
by restructuring bodies
                  ranging from the Judiciary to the Constituent
Assembly. And Chavez initiated
                  the recent rewriting of the Constitution which now
includes such provisions as
                  civil rights for Venezuela's indigenous population.

                  Hugo Chavez, a former military colonel, has been
criticized by Washington as
                  dangerous and undemocratic largely because he
attempted a coup in 1992.
                  After his prison sentence was commuted in 1994, he
continued working with
                  both military and civilians to build a new political
party, the Fifth Republic
                  Movement (MVR) inspired by Simon Bolivar, the 19th
century liberator of
                  South America. In the 1998 general election Chavez won
the presidency and
                  his allies in the MVR took a majority in Congress.

                  Anyone interested in this still unfolding drama should
read Richard Gott’s new
                  book, In the Shadow of the Liberator. This engaging,
detailed but fast paced
                  book explains the rise of Chavismo in Venezuela. The
story opens with the
                  insane 1989 Caracazo -- city-wide riots and looting by
the urban poor
                  triggered by IMF required price increases. The rage
behind this eruption had
                  been brewing for generations and it signaled a chance
to implement changes
                  Chavez and his people had been working on for years.
Gott goes on to
                  investigate the popular unrest -- mostly amongst poor
civilians and the lower
                  ranks of the military -- and the key players that help
fuel Chavez's eventual
                  electoral landslide. Most impressive are Gott's up to
date reporting and
                  interviews with Chavez and many of the president’s
closest allies and critics.

                  Contrary to popular belief, the central figures in the
new government are not all
                  from the military. Take for example the compelling
character of Ali Rodriquez.
                  A former Marxist guerrilla who fought in the hills of
Falcon state in the sixties,
                  he later became a labor lawyer in the densely
industrialized Ciudad Guyana.
                  Rodriguez now serves as Chavez’s Minister of Energy
and Mines, in charge of
                  the nation’s enormous oil industry. By reorganizing
Petroleos de Venezuela,
                  Rodriguez has been able to flip the trend away from
increased privatization
                  toward stronger state control. With rents from oil
being Venezuela’s main
                  revenue source – they are the US’s number one supplier
– petroleum earnings
                  are crucial for the economic survival of this unevenly
developed country.
                  Rodriguez has also reinvigorated OPEC during his two
years as its president. In
                  that time oil prices have jumped from $8 a barrel to
$27 – substantially
                  increasing the country’s income and spotlighting
Venezuela’s power on the
                  global stage.

                  According to Gott, Venezuela is now cultivating a
fundamentally different
                  relationship to its oil: “More than fifty years ago,
people talked of ‘sowing the
                  oil’, using the oil rent to improve agriculture. This
never happened, and Chavez
                  now plans that it will.” Oil revenue is the main
source of funds for Chavez’s
                  “Bolivarian” development projects. Jorge Giordani,
Minister of Development in
                  charge of Cordiplan, is responsible for planning the
revitalization of the
                  country’s rural economy. The development minister,
once Chavez’s economics
                  tutor, worked as a radical economist and University
professor before joining the
                  new government. Giordani’s Cordiplan is creating a
“revolution in agriculture”
                  by focusing development across the depopulated
countryside. To provide
                  affordable housing and sustainable jobs, the
government is constructing
                  cooperative farming communities for families. After
the mudslides of 1999
                  which killed 15,000 people living in shanty towns on
the steep hills surrounding
                  Caracas, such options are desperately needed.

                  Chavez and his crew are taking on the inequities in
Venezuela’s system. With
                  80% of the population living in poverty, that’s no
small feat. Richard Gott’s
                  book is one of the only places readers concerned with
social justice can find out
                  about the hopeful experiments underway in Venezuela.

                  Heather Rogers has just returned from Venezuela where
she
                  was investigating politics, beaches, fruit bats and
rum.

100 Questions and Answers about Arab Americans:
Content © copyright 2001 Detroit Free Press.

Overview

1. Who are Arab Americans?
Arab Americans are U.S. citizens and permanent residents who trace their
ancestry to or who immigrated from Arabic-speaking places in southwestern
Asia and northern Africa, a region known as the Middle East. Not all people
in this region are Arabs. Most Arab Americans were born in the United
States.

2. How many Arab Americans are there?
This is the subject of some debate. Estimates vary because the U.S. Census
Bureau does not use an Arab American classification and because people
identify themselves in various ways. Some Arab Americans identify themselves
as Middle Eastern, for example. Recent immigrants from many countries are
reluctant to give personal and confidential information to the government,
and an increasing number of people have more than one ethnicity. Estimates
of Arab Americans living in the United States are about 3 million.

3. Where do Arab Americans live?
Arab Americans live in all 50 states, but about a third are concentrated in
California, Michigan and New York. Another third are in these seven states:
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and Virginia.

4. What are the population centers for Arab Americans?
About half of Arab Americans live in 20 metropolitan areas. The top four are
Los Angeles County in California; Wayne and Oakland counties in Michigan;
Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cook County, Ill.

5. Do Arabs have a shared language?
The Arabic language is one of the great unifying and distinguishing
characteristics of Arab people. Even so, colloquial Arabic differs from
place to place. There are several categories: Levantine dialect (Jordan,
Syria, Palestine, Lebanon), Egyptian and North African dialect, and
Khalijji, or Gulf, dialect. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is a pan-Arabic
language used in formal letters, books and newspapers. It is also spoken at
Middle East peace conferences and on television news. Quaranic Arabic, like
MSA, also is a widely spoken form of the language, but it differs in style
and lexicon from MSA. Not all Arab Americans know Arabic, of course, as many
are second-, third- and fourth-generation Americans.

6. Do Arabs have a shared religion?
No. Arabs belong to many religions, including Islam, Christianity, Druze,
Judaism and others. There are further distinctions within each of these, and
some religious groups have evolved new identities and faith practices in the
United States. Be careful to distinguish religion from culture. Although
Arabs are connected by culture, they have different faiths. Common
misperceptions are to think that Arab traditions are Islamic, or that Islam
unifies all Arabs. Most Arab Americans are Catholic or Orthodox Christians,
but this is not true in all parts of the United States. In some areas most
Arab Americans are Muslim.

7. What is the Middle East conflict all about?
This handbook cannot adequately answer that question. The largest conflict
in the Middle East is the Arab-Israeli conflict and the struggle over
Palestine. In addition to conflicts between Arab countries and Israel, there
is disagreement between and within Arab countries. The roots of these
conflicts are in some of the world's oldest religions, ethnic differences
and boundaries drawn during 20th Century colonialism. For more detailed
answers, read some of the books listed in the back of this guide.

8. How does conflict in the Middle East affect Arab Americans?
Because Arabs maintain close family ties, even when separated, and because
many Arab-American communities include recent immigrants, most people have a
keen interest in news from the Middle East. Remember, too, that one reason
many Arab American families immigrated was to escape the very conflicts that
continue today. Mideast issues can unify the Arab vote in America. News
coverage, including wire stories and headlines, must be balanced, accurate,
detailed and fair. Reporters and editors must work to understand the issues.


Origins

9. To which places do Arab Americans trace their ancestry?
Arab Americans trace their roots to many places, including parts or all of
Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya,
Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan,
Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Some Arabs are Israeli
citizens.

10. Is Palestine a country?
Historically, Palestine was a country east of the Mediterranean Sea that
includes Israel and parts of Jordan. As a distinct region, Palestine was
under Ottoman control (a Turkish empire) and then British control until
1948, when the nation of Israel was created. Areas of Palestine became
Israel and part of Jordan. Today, Palestinians share a collective national
identity and are moving back toward independence and self-rule as a country.
The Palestinian National Council, acts as the government.

11. Shouldn't Iran be in that list?
No. Iran is not an Arab country. Although Iran borders Iraq, it is descended
from the Persian empire and has a different language and cultural history
than the Arab countries. The dominant language in Iran is Farsi, not Arabic,
although other languages are spoken there as well. Persian is sometimes used
to describe either the language or the ethnicity, but Farsi and Iranian are
not interchangeable. Iran's location, the fact that it is an Islamic country
and the similarity of its name to Iraq may confuse people.

12. So, not all people from the Middle East are Arabs?
That is correct. The four main language groups in the Middle East are
Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Turkish. Other significant language groups are
Kurdish and Berber. Arabs are largest in terms of population and land
holdings, and this handbook focuses on people who have emigrated from or who
are descended from people in those areas.

13. Are there other groups from the Arab region?
Yes. Assyrians, Berbers, Chaldeans and Kurds have languages rooted in
pre-Arabic times. There also are religious differences. The Chaldeans are
the largest of these groups in the United States.

14. Who are Chaldeans?
Chaldeans are Catholics from Iraq. A religious and ethnic minority there,
Chaldeans have some large communities in the United States, the largest in
Detroit. The Chaldean Catholic Church has had connections with the Roman
Catholic Church since 1551, and has been affiliated since 1830. The Chaldean
Diocese of the Catholic Church in the United States has parishes in
Michigan, California, Chicago and Arizona. It also has several missions.
Churches offer Chaldean language services. Chaldeans and Assyrians, along
with Arabs, are Semite people. The cultural foundation is similar, but the
religious affiliation is different.

15. So, are Chaldeans Arabs, or not?
Chaldeans and Arabs share some issues, but they have different identities.
The Chaldean language is different from Arabic and, in Iraq, Chaldeans are
religiously distinct from the Muslim majority. While Chaldeans foster a
separate identity, they also have an Iraqi nationality and some shared
concerns with Arabs. These nuances are lost by federal classifications,
which sometimes reclassify Chaldeans as Arab or Iraqi. It is best to ask
people how they would like to be identified, to be specific and, when
relevant, to explain.

Language

16. Is Arabic the only language spoken within the Arab world?
No. For example, Assyrian and Chaldean services use a dialect of the
original Aramaic. Berber and Kurdish are other non-Arabic languages of the
Middle East.

17. So, do all Arab Americans speak one of these languages?
No. Remember that many Arab-American families have been in the United States
for generations. Do not assume that an Arab American should know Arabic, any
more than any other American should speak the language of his or her ethnic
group.

18. Many recently immigrated Arab Americans also know French. Why is that?
Part of the recent history of Arab people is colonization by the French and
British. In colonized countries, people in business and government had to
know one or more European languages.

19. Do Arab schools teach other languages?
Definitely. It is much more common for Arab Americans to speak more than one
language than it is for non-Arab Americans. Many countries place more
emphasis on language than the United States does. Many immigrants come to
the United States having learned two or three languages in their country of
origin. Arab countries emphasize the importance of knowing a foreign
language, and they are very familiar with Western media.

20. Is there any advice on pronouncing Arabic names?
Not really. It can be quite difficult to transliterate Arabic words into
English, a language that uses different sounds and fewer letters. Unless you
know the Arabic alphabet, it's hard to know how to pronounce words
correctly. The "r" sound is rolled, and there are characters for three
different pronunciations of the "th" sound. If you are unsure, respectfully
ask a source to explain. Write down the pronunciation and the spelling, so
you can give readers both. Be aware that, for these reasons, spellings vary.

21. Is there any trick to spelling Arabic words?
There are so many variations that it is crucial to ask, as you would with
any word. Because Arabic and English characters and sounds are different,
there is more than one way to transliterate the words. The Associated Press,
for example, recently changed its style for the spelling of Mohammed to
Muhammad, and it has changed its style for Koran to Quran.

22. How is Arabic written?
Arabic is one of several languages written from right to left. It would be
narrow-minded to think of this as backwards writing. Think how you might
feel if someone thought that you were reading this sentence backwards.

23. Are characters in Arabic different than those we use to write English?
Yes. English is written in Latin characters. Arabic is written in the
28-character Arabic alphabet. In Arabic, a character may change depending on
its placement in the word or sentence. Arabic letters are connected like
script. Fine writing is called calligraphy and is held in high regard and
appreciated as an art form in the Arabic culture.

Demographics

24. When did Arab people come to the United States?
Today, most Arab Americans are native-born Americans. The first significant
wave of immigration began around 1875. It lasted until about 1920. After a
period in which the United States restricted immigration, a second wave
began in the 1940s.

25. Why did Arabs first come to the United States?
Like many peoples who came to the United States, Arabs were seeking
opportunity. Factors in the first immigration were Japanese competition that
hurt the Lebanese silk market and a disease that hurt Lebanese vineyards.
Most early Arab immigrants were from Lebanon and Syria, and most were
Christian.

26. What prompted the second wave?
After 1940, immigration to the United States was not for economic reasons as
much as because of the Arab-Israeli conflict and civil war. This meant that
people came from many more places. The second immigration also had many more
people who practiced Islam, a religion that was not as familiar in the
United States. Immigrants in this group tended to be more financially secure
when they arrived than people who had come earlier for economic opportunity.
Many people in the second wave were students.

27. What race are Arab Americans?
Arabs may have white skin and blue eyes, olive or dark skin and brown eyes.
Hair textures differ. The United States has, at different times, classified
Arab immigrants as African, Asian, white, European or as belonging to a
separate group. Most Arab Americans identify more closely with nationality
than with ethnic group.

28. Are Arabs a minority group?
This depends, in part, on your definition of minority. The U.S. government
does not classify Arabs as a minority group for purposes of employment and
housing. Arabs are not defined specifically by race, like some minority
groups, but are united by culture and language. Some Arab Americans see
minority classification as an impediment to full participation in American
life. Others are asking for protection from the same issues affecting people
in minority groups, such as profiling, stereotyping and exclusion.

29. Are Arab Americans more closely tied to their country of origin, or to
America?
This need not be an either-or issue. Arab Americans have dual loyalties.
While they may be closely tied to their countries of origin, most Arab
Americans were born in the United States, and an even larger majority have
U.S. citizenship. This is reflected in the expression, "Truly Arab and fully
American."

30. Who are some well-known Arab Americans?
Christa McAuliffe, the teacher/astronaut who died aboard the space shuttle
Challenger; Indy 500 winner Bobby Rahal; Heisman Trophy winner and NFL
quarterback Doug Flutie; creators of radio's American Top 40 Casey Kasem and
Don Bustany; Mothers Against Drunk Driving founder Candy Lightner; Jacques
Nasser, president and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Co., and Helen
Thomas, former dean of the White House press corps.

31. Does the U.S. Census Bureau collect data on Arab Americans?
While the census does not specifically classify Arab Americans, it does
collect enough data to present some population characteristics. Some of that
information is on the U.S. Census Bureau's Web site at www.census.gov, and
is reflected in this guide.

32. What is the educational level of Arab Americans?
Arab Americans are, on average, better educated than non-Arab Americans. The
proportion of Arab Americans who attend college is higher than the national
average. Compared to the norm, about twice as many Arab Americans, in
percentage terms, earn degrees beyond the bachelor's degree. Key factors in
this question are country of origin, length of time in the United States and
gender.

33. What occupations do Arab Americans pursue?
Arab Americans work in all occupations. Collectively, they are more likely
to be self-employed or to be entrepreneurs or to work in sales. About 60
percent of working Arab Americans are executives, professionals, office and
sales staff. At the local level, Arab Americans are most likely to be
executives in Washington, D.C., and Anaheim, Calif.; sales people in
Cleveland and Anaheim, and manufacturing workers in Detroit. As with all
people, employment choices may be influenced by nationality, religion,
education, socio-economic status and gender.

34. How do Arab Americans fare economically?
Individually, Arab Americans are at every economic strata of American life.
Nationally, Arab-American households have a higher than average median
income. Like occupational patterns, this varies by location. Arab-American
earnings are below the overall average income in Detroit and Anaheim.


Family

35. What is the role of the family in Arab culture?
The variety of family types among Arab Americans is vast, and influenced by
the same factors mentioned in the answer to Question 33. Generally, family
is more important than the individual and more influential than nationality.
People draw much of their identity from their role in the family.
Historically, this has fostered immigration in which members of an extended
family or clan help one another immigrate.

36. Do Arab Americans maintain ties with their home countries?
Many do. They are very proud of their home countries and may maintain
regular contact with relatives or friends there, as many Americans do. Arab
Americans will sometimes joke with one another over which of their home
countries is the best, but it is perfectly consistent to have loyalties both
to their place of origin and their country of citizenship.

37. What are gender roles like for Arab Americans?
These vary tremendously. Some of the variables are country of origin,
whether the family came from a rural or urban area and how long the person's
family has been in the United States. It is more accurate to ask the subject
of the story about his or her own experience than to apply a stereotype.

38. Do Arab Americans have large families?
Arab-American families are, on average, larger than non-Arab-American
families and smaller than families in Arab countries. Traditionally, more
children meant more pride and economic contributors for the family. The cost
of having large families in the United States, however, and adaptation to
American customs seem to encourage smaller families.

39. What kind of relationship does cousin mean to Arab Americans?
The same as for other Americans, though Arabs may differentiate between
maternal and paternal cousins when they refer to them.

40. Do generations of Arab Americans live together?
Sometimes, especially with people who have more recently arrived in the
United States, but this can be true of non-Arabs as well and is not a
distinguishing characteristic of Arab Americans.

41. Do Arab Americans typically get married at a younger age than non-Arabs?
Yes, though this is changing. As women follow careers, they are not expected
to marry so young. Arab women might also marry older men who can provide
greater financial security.

42. Are marriages arranged?
This is very rare, except among the most recent immigrants. Remember that
most Arab Americans were born here, and that they frequently marry people
from other cultures. In the case where a marriage is arranged, a parent may
recommend someone from another family or from the country of origin, but the
child is not forced to marry that person. More typically,couples meet and
ask their families' approval before getting engaged, or make their own
decision and then tell their families.

43. Do Arab Americans prefer to marry each other?
As with many people, in-group marriage may be encouraged as a way to
preserve heritage, but Arabs and non-Arabs frequently marry one other.
Religious differences among Arab Americans, in fact, may make it more
desirable to marry a non-Arab of similar religious background than an Arab
of a different religion.

44. Are there any Arab conventions for naming children?
Muslims often name their children after prophets in the Quran. ShiÕa Muslims
sometimes use Ali as a middle name. Christians often name their children
after people in the Bible. Although names can give an indication of a
person's religion, don't assume. Arab tradition may call for the father's
name to be the middle name of sons and daughters.

45. What does the title Umm or Abu mean as part of a name?
It is a common way of calling someone using their oldest son's name. Umm
means mother of. Abu means father of. "Umm Muhammad" is "mother of
Muhammad." This is what friends might call her, as a sign of respect.

46. What do Arabs mean when they refer to someone as Auntie?
It is a sign of respect, not necessarily family relationship. An Arab
American might call any older Arab male or female "auntie" or "uncle." Many
Arab Americans do not use these terms at all. Journalists can show respect
by using courtesy titles.


Customs

47. Why do some Arab women wear garments that cover their faces or heads?
This is a religious practice, not a cultural practice. It is rooted in
Islamic teachings about hijab, or modesty. While some say that veiling
denigrates women, some women say that it liberates them. Covering is not
universally observed by Muslim women and varies by region and class. Some
Arab governments have, at times, banned or required veiling. In American
families, a mother or daughter may cover her head while the other does not.

48. What garments might a woman wear to practice hijab?
One interpretation is that everything should be covered except hands, face
and feet. Long clothing and a scarf would accomplish this and the head scarf
might be called a hijab or chador. The long, robelike garment is called an
abayah, jilbab, or chador. In Iraq and Saudi Arabia especially, a woman may
wear a cloak that covers her head. Beneath a robe, a woman may be wearing a
traditional dress, casual clothes or a business suit. The veil, in
particular, has been made controversial by governments, gender politics and
religious biases. Most Muslim women in the United States do not wear veils.

49. Some Arab men wear a checked garment on their heads. What is that?
It is called a kafiyyeh and it is traditional, not religious. Wearing the
kafiyyeh is similar to an African American wearing traditional African
attire, or an Indian wearing a sari. The kafiyyeh shows identity and pride
in one's culture.

50. Why do some Arab women dress in black?
Remember that black is a popular color in contemporary American fashion and
may not have any special significance. When it does, it may be a sign of
mourning. Black, when worn in mourning, may be worn for a few days to many
years.

51. What is an appropriate way to greet an Arab American?
This is not difficult or tricky. Remember that most Arab Americans grew up
here and do not require special greetings. Be yourself, and let them be
themselves. If they are practicing Muslims or recent immigrants, watch for
cues. A smile, a nod and a word of greeting are appropriate in most
situations. Some Muslims feel it is inappropriate for unrelated men and
women to shake hands. Wait until the other person extends his or her hand
before you extend your own.

52. What are the customs for paying compliments?
Again, be yourself and be observant. In most cases, there is no reason to
behave differently than you would with anyone else. For some recent
immigrants, be a little more reserved. Complimenting a possession may be
misunderstood and the person, out of generosity and hospitality, may feel
compelled to offer you the object. There can be a lot of difference between
one person and another, even a parent and child, so don't assume one way is
always best.

53. What about gift-giving?
The giving of token gifts is a polite practice in many cultures and American
businesses. A gift, then, can put journalistic integrity and cultural
sensitivity into conflict. You will have to balance your journalistic ethics
against the risk of offending someone by refusing a gift. Consider your
ethics policy, the giver's intention, the effects of acceptance or denial,
as well as the value of the gift. You may need to consult with your
supervisor or explain yourself to the giver.

54. What is Middle-Eastern food like?
Tasty! It is varied, but has some staples. Wheat is used in bread, pastries,
salads and main dishes. Rice is often cooked with vegetables, lamb, chicken
or beef. Lamb and mutton are more common than other meats. Arab recipes use
many beans and vegetables, including eggplant, zucchini, cauliflower,
spinach, onions, parsley and chickpeas.

55. What is that pipe I sometimes see people smoking?
It is a water pipe that filters and cools tobacco smoke, which often is
flavored with apple, honey, strawberry, mint, mango or apricot. Such pipes
are used in several parts of the world and are not an exclusively Arab
apparatus. They are known by several names, including sheesha, hookah and
argilah, or argeelah.


Religion

56. Do most Arab Americans belong to the same religion?
Most Arab Americans are Christian, though this varies by region. In many
communities, Muslim and Christian Arabs live side by side with each other
and with non-Arab religious communities. Most Arab countries are
predominantly Muslim.

57. Is Islam mostly an Arab religion, then?
No. Only about 12 percent of Muslims worldwide are Arabs. There are more
Muslims in Indonesia, for example, than in all Arab countries combined.
Large populations of Muslims also live in India, Iran, other parts of East
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Islam has a strong Arab flavor, though, as the
religion's holiest places are in the Middle East, and the Quran was
originally written in Arabic.

58. What is the Quran?
The Quran is the holy book for Muslims, who believe it contains the word of
God revealed to the prophet Muhammad. The Quran has many passages that are
similar to those in the Bible, which Muslims also regard as a holy book. The
Quran has been translated into many languages, including English, and is
available on the Web. Quran is Associated Press style. Other spellings are
Qur'an and Koran. Variations come from transliterating Arabic into English.

59. What is the difference between Islam and Muslim?
Islam is the religion, and a Muslim is a follower of the religion. It is
like the difference between Christianity and Christian. The adjective form
is Islamic.

60. What are the five pillars of Islam?
The five pillars are minimum sacred obligations for followers who are able
to observe them. They are: belief in the shehada, the statement that "There
is no god but God, and Muhammad is his prophet"; salat, or prayer five times
a day; zakat, the sharing of alms with the poor; fasting during the holy
month of Ramadan, and the hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.

61. What is Ramadan?
Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim calendar, is a month of fasting whose
end is marked with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr. During this month of
self-discipline and purification, Muslims abstain from food, drink and sex
from before sunrise until sundown. At night, however, they may feast. The
Islamic calendar is based on the cycles of the moon and has 354 days, so
Ramadan does not always occur at the same time of year according to the
365-day civil calendar.

62. What is the proper greeting during Ramadan?
You may say, "Ramadan Mubarrak." You could also say, "Salaam," which means
"peace" and is useful at any time. If you are planning to meet with Muslims
during Ramadan, be aware that they may be fasting and a meal-time meeting
may be awkward.

63. Must Arabs make a journey to Mecca?
This relates to Muslims, not all Arabs. Learn to keep that distinction in
mind. Muslims who are financially and physically able to do so are expected
to make the journey at least once in their lifetime.

64. What does hajj mean?
Al hajj refers to the pilgrimage to Mecca by millions of Muslims once each
year. It is a milestone event in a Muslim's life. A man who makes the trip
is recognized with the title hajji, which means pilgrim. For women, the
title is hajjah.

65. What is the difference between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims?
Historically, these are the two main branches of Islam, and their
distinction has to do with the successor of the prophet Muhammad. Sunnis
believe his successors were elected religious leaders; Shi'a believe that
the prophet appointed Ali ibn Abi Taleb. The answer is much more complicated
than this, though, because there are other differences and new ones have
arisen over the years. There also are separate groups and movements within
each branch. In the United States, Muslim unity often overshadows the
divisions. Most Muslims worldwide and in the United States are Sunni, though
Shi'as dominate in some communities. Most Muslims in Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon
and the non-Arab country of Iran are Shi'a.

66. Are there restrictions on entering a mosque?
One generally must enter without shoes. Look for a sign from your host, or
for a place to leave your shoes. Women should dress modestly and may be
asked to cover their heads. Men should wear long pants and shirts. Men and
women generally pray in different areas.

67. Is it OK to take pictures there?
Each mosque has its own rules. Ask in advance and do not assume it will be
OK to photograph at will. Be prepared to make some accommodations if certain
angles or parts of the mosque are off limits.

68. Who is an imam?
The leader of prayer at a mosque. He might also be called a sheik. One of an
imam's responsibilities is to give sermons on Friday, the holiest day of the
typical Islamic week. In many American mosques, the imam is also the
administrator. To journalists, an imam can be an important community leader
and a good source of information about local Muslims.

69. What are important Islamic holidays?
The most important Muslim observance each year is Ramadan. Muslims also
celebrate Eid al-Adha on the last day of the hajj -- the pilgrimage to Mecca
-- and Eid al-Fitr, at the end of Ramadan. Depending on the makeup of your
area, these are worthy of consideration as news events. There are other
holidays, as well, but do not assume that a holiday or practice observed at
one mosque is observed by all.

70. Where is the headquarters for Islam?
Islam does not have the same kind of hierarchy as some other religions.
There is no top official or ruling board for Islam. Muslim mosques, or
masjids, and associations are independent. Muslims are not required to be
members of a mosque.

71. Why do some Arab men decline to shake hands with women?
Some Muslim men, for religious reasons, avoid physical contact with women
other than close relatives. This is not true for all Muslims and exceptions
are made to help women who are injured, crossing the street, etc.

72. Is the Nation of Islam related to Islam?
This African American religious group is closely related to Islam, but
evolved in the 20th Century with some different practices than those
followed by most Muslims. Most African-American Muslims in the United States
are not part of the Nation of Islam.

73. What is Eastern rite or Eastern Orthodox?
Be careful. These are designations for Christian churches that share some
similarities, but that have different histories. Eastern rite churches are
part of the Catholic church with roots in the Middle East and include
Maronites, Melkites and Chaldeans. Eastern Orthodox churches, which are
independent from Vatican authority, include the Syrian and Coptic churches.

74. Who are Coptics?
The word Copt is derived from the Greek word for Egyptian and Coptic was the
native language of Egypt before Arabic prevailed. Today, the word refers to
Coptic Christians. Although linguistically and culturally classified as
Arabs, many consider themselves to be ethnically distinct from other
Egyptians.

75. What does Allah mean?
Allah means God. The same word is used by Arabic-speaking Christians,
Muslims and Jews. When translating Arabic expressions, translate all the
words, for consistency. The translation of "Allahu Akbar," for example,
would be "God is great," not "Allah is great."

76. Why do Muslims face east when they pray?
They are facing Kaaba (the House of God) at Mecca, the holiest of the three
cities of Islam. Muslims in other countries face different directions,
depending on where they are in relation to Mecca.

77. What are the other two holy cities?
Medina in Saudi Arabia and Jerusalem.


Politics

78. Are Arab Americans active in U.S. politics?
Yes. For decades, Arab Americans have voted, run for office and been
elected. According to John L. Zogby, a pollster who is Arab American, 86
percent of voting-age Arab Americans in early 2000 were registered voters.
In 1996, exit polls said 54 percent of the Arab-American vote was for Bill
Clinton, 38 percent went for Bob Dole and 7.7 percent went for independent
candidate H. Ross Perot. The 2000 campaign was the first in which both major
presidential candidates addressed Arab Americans.

79. Have Arab Americans won major political offices?
Yes. In 1998, for example, 12 Arab Americans campaigned for the U.S.
Congress in 10 states.

80. Who are some prominent Arab-American politicians?
They have included U.S. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine;
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham; former secretary of He

80. Who are some prominent Arab-American politicians?
They have included U.S. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine;
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham; former secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala; former New Hampshire governor and White House chief
of staff John Sununu, and 2000 presidential candidate Ralph Nader.

81. Is there an Arab lobby?
There is not an Arab lobby in the sense of a monolithic, controlling body.
There are several organizations that lobby in behalf of a variety of issues,
including domestic and international concerns. One is the Arab American
Institute, which supports presidential and congressional candidates who are
receptive to Arab-American concerns. Another is the American Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, a civil rights group.


Terminology

82. Should I say Arab, Arabic or Arabian?
Arab is a noun for a person, and is used as an adjective, as in "Arab
country." Arabic is the name of the language and generally is not used as an
adjective. Arabian is an adjective that refers to Saudi Arabia, the Arabian
Peninsula, or as in Arabian horse. When ethnicity or nationality are
relevant, it is more precise and accurate to specify the country by using
Lebanese, Yemeni or whatever is appropriate. We suggest that you hyphenate
when using Arab-American as an adjective, as in Arab-American issues, but do
not hyphenate when saying that someone is an Arab American.

83. Is Arab American, or American Arab preferred?
Arab American but, again, if you can be more specific, do so.

84. How should I refer to an Arab-American individual?
Preferably by the country that person is from, for example, "of Lebanese
heritage," or "of Jordanian descent," but only if ethnicity is relevant.
Remember that Arab Americans come from many places, and you should include
the relevant perspective. If the story is about an issue that affects
Yemenis, for example, don't treat other Arabic perspectives as
interchangeable.

85. What if the story is about Arab Americans whose ethnicity is not
relevant to the story?
Then there is no need to identify their ethnicity. It is important to
include Arab Americans even when the story is about issues unrelated to
heritage or culture. Arab Americans are teachers, lawyers, grocers,
executives and students. Their views are important to many stories. If
journalists confine Arab Americans to stories about Arab issues, other
facets of their experience are ignored and the overall portrayal is
one-dimensional.

86. What does Mohammedanism mean?
Do not use Mohammedan and its derivatives. Instead, use Islam for the
religion, Muslim for a follower of the religion and derivatives of these
words.

87. Is it Muslim or Moslem?
Muslim.

88. Who is a sheik?
A sheik can be the leader of a family, a village, a tribe or a mosque. Press
accounts popularized the term "oil-rich sheik." This contributed to the
misconception that the people who became wealthy from oil were sheiks, and
that sheiks had oil money. Neither is true.


Stereotypes

89. Are Arabs oil-rich?
Some are, most aren't. The area around the Persian Gulf is one of several
oil-producing areas in the world, but not all Arab countries produce oil,
and very few Arabs are rich from oil.

90. Are Arabs mostly a nomadic people?
No. Most live in urban areas, but portrayals of Arabs as desert dwellers
have distorted the picture. Bedouins, nomadic people depicted in movies,
make up only about 2 percent of Arab people. One of the largest Arab cities
is Cairo, with a population of more than 6 million.

91. Do Arabs come from the desert?
Most do not. To begin with, most Arabs live in cities. Secondly, Arab
countries have a range of climates. Many have coastal areas and some have
mountainous areas that get snow. Arab people come from a variety of
latitudes that extend from as far south as just below the equator to as far
north as approximately Lexington, Ky.

92. Are Arabs frequently involved in terrorism?
No more so than other groups of people. Many types of people have committed
acts of terror. However, news accounts seem to more often stress Arab
connections than they do for terrorism committed by other groups. In
addition, there have been highly publicized cases when Arabs were singled
out, early on and erroneously, as suspects. The Oklahoma City federal
building bombing in 1995 was one such case.

93. What is meant by the phrase "Islamic fundamentalist"?
This is complex. The term fundamentalist, whether applied to Muslims or
Christians, is a largely American construct that has been used to imply
politically conservatism and, sometimes, extremism. The term "Islamic
fundamentalist" has been used to refer to people who use Islam to justify
political actions. This has blurred the distinction between religion and
politics. Because of this, acts carried out for political reasons are
sometimes attributed to religion. Fairness and accuracy mean attributing
political actions to the group, government or party responsible, and not to
a religion, which may have millions of followers around the world. Avoid
constructions like "Muslim bomb."

94. Is Islam a violent religion?
The Quran teaches nonviolence. Throughout history, political groups and
leaders have used Islam and other religions to justify many things,
including violence

95. Are Arab-American women subservient to men?
No sweeping statement can reflect all the roles of Arab women. They range
from leaders of matriarchal societies to independent businesswomen to
extreme deference. Their roles are affected by their country of origin,
whether they are from urban or rural areas, religion, degree of assimilation
and, of course, their own, individual characteristics.

96. What is that charm with the eye or an eye on a hand?
Often worn as jewelry, the hamsa is a non-religious symbol for protection or
good luck. The eye, usually blue when colored, wards off the evil eye or
evil spirits. For example, the charm may be put on a baby to protect the
child from harm. This cultural tradition is shared by many people of
different religions.


Coverage

97. How can I find Arab Americans in my community?
In cities where there are large populations, this is easy. You can find
restaurants, stores, markets and other businesses with Arabic names or
writing on them. Look for organizations, community centers, churches and
mosques that might be Arab-related. Use these as beginning points, and don't
keep going back to the same people, or focus only on recent immigrants. To
find Arab Americans in places where they are less prevalent, try some of the
organizations in Resources.

98. Are there issues about the way Arab Americans are portrayed in the
media?
Yes. In some cases, journalists seem to prefer to publish or air images of
people who look different, or exotic. In trying for a more interesting
image, they may emphasize the difference between Arab Americans and non-Arab
Americans. Most Arab Americans do not wear traditional clothing. News
organizations whose collective reports give the impression that Arab
Americans generally dress differently than non-Arab Americans are being
inaccurate.

99. Is there a coverage pitfall that reporters should avoid?
Like many groups, Arab Americans say that reporters stay away unless there
is a problem to report, or if there is a national or international crisis
for which they want reaction. This keeps people out of sight except when
they are associated with trouble. The solution is to cover Arab Americans
consistently and continuously. By paying attention to what communities say
are significant news issues, reporters offer deeper and fuller coverage.

100. How can I learn more?
We're glad you asked. This resource guide is just an introduction. Any one
of the 100 questions in it has answers that would fill a book. We have
listed some resources for further study in the following pages. We also
encourage you to get out and talk to people, and to invite them to visit
your newsroom.

. . . at least I've heard it was Marx.

Could someone please provide the exact citation for
the phrase "bloodless war"?  . . . which refers to
economics: "economics is bloodless war", or "money is
bloodless war".

Will be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

A Lot We Don't Know

"There is a lot we don't know," someone, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told an unknown source at some point within the last several days or weeks.
This is the third, fourth, or perhaps even the dozenth--or two-dozenth--time
someone has spoken on condition of anonymity, or whose name wasn't quite
caught by this or that reporter.

"It's not always clear," someone else, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, "whether someone is speaking on condition of anonymity, or
whether our source wasn't sure who the speaker was ... or what."

"All we know," an alleged third speaker is reported to have
suggested--authorities were not in a position to name him or her--"is that
there really is an awful lot that we just don't know. It's like--it's not
really all that surprising, I guess. We don't know everything. I mean, I
*am* surprised, but--maybe that's just me? Is it? I really don't know."

One thing many people speaking on condition of anonymity do know is that it
might--or might not--be what we don't know that we need to worry about most.
Or, perhaps the fact that we don't really know should put us at ease.

"That's a tough call," an unidentified caller admitted. "You can't spend
your life worrying about what you don't know. I mean, you *can*, but--"

"These are murky, confusing times," one official--who asked not to be
identified--is reported to have said, possibly at a press conference or
maybe in passing--"and it's just, you know ..." his or her voice trailed
off.

Another unidentified official agreed, "I guess what this all adds up to--I
mean, if what we're seeing here is an accurate depiction--is that we simply
can't afford to jump to conclusions at this point. Or, no--is that right? We
just don't know enough. I mean, maybe we can never afford to jump to
conclusions, I'm not sure. I would have to have more facts at my disposal to
really be clearer about that aspect."

Many people have expressed frustration with the more-or-less recent lack of
conclusive information. "It's frustrating," one person said. "I mean, it can
be. It's not necessarily frustrating. But I can see how it might be. You
know? I mean, I dunno. I can see both sides of this, and actually other
sides--many other sides." When pressed on the number of sides, the
unidentified person admitted that he--or she--was "at a loss to say how many
sides, if any, actually even exist."

Weapons, from handguns to fighter jets, are a profitable business. Generous
government contracts, huge profit margins, and inevitable cost over-runs
ensure spectacular dividends for weapons producers. Conflicts burning
throughout the world guarantee plenty of buyers. After a post-cold war
decline, global weapons purchases rose in 2000 to $800 billion. In the
aftermath of the September 11 tragedies, arms production and sales worldwide
will likely continue their upward trajectory--encouraged by national policies
and supported by multilateral economic institutions.
Although most military contractors are neither "infant" industries in need of
nurturing nor spent giants on the verge of bankruptcy, states continue to
subsidize the production of arms. Even the most die-hard laissez-faire
governments, committed on paper to maintaining a firewall between the state
and the economy, are propping up their arms manufacturers. The United States,
for instance, provided $1.2 billion in tax relief when Lockheed merged with
Martin Marietta to form the world's largest arms manufacturer, Lockheed
Martin.

According to the logic of free trade, the cornerstone of globalization, such
subsidies are "nontariff barriers to trade." They are, in other words, an
unfair advantage enjoyed by a company doing business in the world market. And
international financial institutions are committed to removing such
advantages.Military Subsidies Treated Differently


But every trade accord treats military subsidies as different from all other
subsidies. This is known as the "national security exception." Included in
the original General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947 and every
trade accord since, this provision allows states to subsidize production,
promote sales, and impose trade embargoes they deem necessary for the
maintenance of national security. So, according to free trade rules, if the
U.S. subsidizes the production for export of a Boeing 747, other countries
can file grievances through the World Trade Organization (WTO). But the U.S.
can subsidize the production of a Boeing F-15 fighter jet that is sold
overseas, and no country will call foul.
In some cases, this security exception channels money from the civilian to
the military sector. The Canadian government subsidized civilian passenger
jets produced by Bombardier Aerospace until other countries protested through
the WTO. So Canada switched to subsidizing Bombardier's military production.
Other countries view military production as the dangling rope that will pull
them out of their current economic difficulties. The South African government
continues to subsidize Denel, the state-owned weapons producer. As a hedge
against Denel's eventual privatization and to boost industrial production,
the government created the Industrial Participation Programme to solicit
civilian investment from European arms manufacturers that offsets the costs
of major weapons systems. In such cases, civil investment is held hostage to
arms acquisitions.
Government subsidies often result in cheaper weapons. For arms importing
countries, the security exception means more bang for the bucks spent buying
weapons abroad--and a heightened risk of regional conflict
escalation.Challenging the Militarization-Globalization Nexus


The Pentagon, the Commerce Department, and international financial and trade
institutions make for a powerful trinity. At a global level, when this unholy
trinity supports the spread of arms, the increase of defense budgets, and the
dominance of arms manufacturers, the deck is stacked. Yet there are some ways
to challenge this nexus of globalization and militarization.
The chief dilemma, a variation on the "inside-outside" conundrum, is whether
to challenge these institutions to play by the rules they have developed or
to challenge the rules themselves.
Let's consider the first tactic of using the rules to challenge
militarization. Because of the criticisms of watchdog organizations and
demonstrators in the streets, the IMF is now more willing to argue for
reductions in defense budgets, as it has done in South Korea, Peru, and
throughout Africa. Activists can challenge the institution to follow its own
"best practices." According to this tactic, the IMF's budget-cutting zeal is
turned back on itself in order to reduce military expenditures worldwide.
By the same logic, the Bush administration could be pressed to extend to the
military sector its well-known aversion to industrial policy (that is,
government policies that foster development through support for selected
industries). The defense industry enjoys the advantages of corporate welfare
through tax loopholes, export assistance, R & D, and various guarantees. Even
a soupcon of laissez-faire would improve this toxic recipe. Moreover, the
Defense Export Loan Guarantee program and the drug war exemption in the
Export Import Bank charter are innovations of the Clinton administration.
Republicans should be encouraged to play the partisan card and trim the
Democratic pork in the military sector. Meanwhile, the Bush administration's
aggressive diplomacy on behalf of domestic defense contractors could also be
targeted as a nontariff barrier to trade.
To persuade the South Korean government to buy F-16 fighter planes, the U.S.
announced that it would not help integrate U.S. weapons and cryptographic
systems should South Korea opt for the French fighter instead. Here again,
activists could charge the Bush administration with blatant interference in
the free market.
Activists can similarly press the WTO to begin severing the ties that bind
together the military-industrial complex. Although there is little support
among WTO members for eliminating the WTO's security exception, WTO members
may successfully challenge subsidized military programs whose primary purpose
is to enhance civilian production. The various incentives that the U.S.
government offers private cargo carriers to purchase Boeing's C-17
Globemaster military transport plane could, for example, be criticized on
such grounds. Similarly, if transportation services are liberalized at the
WTO level, there could be a successful WTO challenge to the Maritime Security
Program in the United States.
The second tactic is to challenge the rules themselves, because the rules are
biased in favor of the powerful. One of the more powerful tools to be
deployed against the military-industrial complex is transparency. By
implementing registers of arms transfers and exposing corrupt deals such as
the recent British-Saudi Arabian weapons-for-oil deal, journalists and
activists can begin to build new systems of rules that will contain global
arms trade in much the way that the Lilliputians used slender filaments to
restrain the giant Gulliver. International codes of conduct, like the one
proposed by former Costa Rican president Oscar Arias, could introduce minimum
standards into a destructively liberalized environment.
Such measures would pave the way for more radical steps. A military Tobin
tax, levied on every cross-border military deal, would generate funds for
destroying nuclear and other weapons as well as to convert defense industries
to civilian production. More subversively, such a tax could throw sand in the
cogs of the emerging global military-industrial complex just as economist
James Tobin imagined his tax on financial transactions would slow the
rapid-fire transfer of capital around the world.
As a result of the September 11 attacks, the dangers of globalized
militarism--the deregulation of weapons markets and the privatization of
militaries--has become apparent even to the Bush administration. Weapons can
end up anywhere; terrorists can raise funds in deregulated financial markets
and unregulated black markets; private armies can rival state militaries.
State subsidies for military production, protected by the security exception,
have only increased the number of weapons available. In this new era,
international institutions should permit government subsidies, investments,
and taxes that scale down arms production, redirect funds from the military
to the civilian sector, and otherwise dismantle the economic motor of
globalized militarism. This is the one type of security exception to free
trade regulations and budget restrictions that makes sense in a world awash i
n weapons.

YOUR WORKS!
This writing workshop will focus on the participants' own poems, their
intentions and realizations, triumphs, disappointments, and creative
mistakes.  It will also attempt to examine and clarify the traditions of
which these poems  partake (consciously or not).  Constructive advice on, and
criticism of, the works produced by the participants will be given both by
the instructor and by the participants themselves.

Laird Hunt-4-6 p.m.(class size limit: 6)

Anne Carson, in the Autobiography of Red, Michael Ondaatje, in the Collected
Works of Billy the Kid, W.G. Sebald, in The Rings of Saturn, David Markson,
in Wittgenstein's Mistress, have written books that defy categorization.  We
will discuss such mongrel works and examine how blending genre and angle of
attack can help us craft lively and challenging fiction.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13

WRITING WORKSHOP
Eleni Sikelianos-4-6 p.m.
How Do Poets Respond to Crisis?

The crisis might be personal, political or cultural-war, death, loss,
madness, oppression, genocide, bombs. Poetry itself might be seen as a crisis
of language; the crisis of any era embodied in words.  In this workshop, we
will consider how language might be used in times of trouble.  Poets (who
have long been writing in the rift) we look to as models for our own poems
might include Paul Celan, H.D., George Oppen, Walt Whitman, Amiri Baraka.
Responses might include joyful exuberance to counteract the darkness of the
times, a disintegrating language that reflects a shredded "reality," poems of
love as antidote or anodyne.

READING  7:30 p.m.

Hello,

My philosophy when teaching introductory creative writing courses is to run
them as reading/writing seminars, i.e. I have the students read a lot of
literature and respond to it rather than just "workshopping." All the
creative writing textbooks I have are either dull or ridiculous, but I'm
wondering if there are any "How to" books -- for either poetry or prose --
that you have found useful for young college writers.

Also, of the books on poetics, versification, form, etc. which have you
found useful in the classroom?

Thanks in advance for your recommendations,
Kathy Lou

Hey, I just got my copy of this yesterday.  Most excellent, indeed,
for anyone interested in the really new.  And first-rate.

Dear Kathy Lou,
I know I wrote it but would like to recommend  BLACK LIGHTNING: POETRY IN
PROGRESS (published by Asian American Writers Workshop and distributed
through Temple University Press).  It's a unique anthology that features 15
poets of varying styles.  The poets gave me first drafts, begining drafts and
final drafts of 1-3 subject poems.  Then I interviewed them about their
underlying process from both the standpoints of inspiration and craft.
Questions ranged from what inspired this poem, who has influenced you as a
poet, why did you add or delete this line-break in that stanza, why did you
delete the word "a"...so the questions ranged from large to small, from form
to subject matter...

It's a great teaching tool (or so teachers have told me) because the actual
drafts of poems are featured in the book, along with the interview about
those featured drafts.

I began this book when I was just 3 months into writing poetry so I may not
be that different from many college freshmen you would teach?  (And so some
of my questions, too, are really, ahem, innocent...).  I did the project
because I wanted to know what a poem is and how one writes it (and leapt into
the deep end by "beginning" with Arthur Sze and Mei-mei Berssenbrugge...).
Featured poets: Meena Alexander, Indran Amirthanayagam, Mei-mei, Luis
Cabalquinto, Marilyn Chin, Sesshu Foster, Jessica Hagedorn, Kimiko Hahn,
Li-Young Lee, Garrett Hongo, Timothy Liu, David Mura, Arthur Sze and John Yau.

It features Asian American poets but its nature has made the book be picked
up by general creative writing courses in addition to various Asian American
courses (though inevitably the student also learns about the extra dimension
of Asian America).  And if you are teaching in the Bay Area, I do free
classroom visits to whoever uses this book as text (if there's interest in my
visiting...).  Last semester, I visited an introductory writing course for
this purpose at SFSU.

More information about the book is at Temple University's website:

Gene. Not "picking on" he Jews: they, the Israeli Right actually: are
picking on themselves with active US assistance. If you want to get rid of
terrorists then the US should help the Isrealis to bomb the hell out of
what's left of Palestine as terroism by Jews (supposedly its all caused by
the Palestinians) and Palestinians (throwing handgrenades - or whatever
hurts - at patrols etc) goes on daily and worse...the British should bomb
Ireland for harbouring terrorists: and NZ for that matter and America for
harbouring pro Irish terrorists, the US should also bomb New Jersy ...better
they should bomb themselves as they probably "jacked" up the whole thing. It
went too smoothly. The speeches were all obviously rehearsed. No one in the
Right was surprised.... and so it goes  on and on.  Richard

Gwynn. If women cant stand being trashed should we thaen treat them more
gently: discrimminate against them. Every one: men and women get trashed.
There's nothing stopping women speaking out: if they want "eqaulity" or
whatevr they have to be prepared to be trashed and argued with as men argue.
  Apart from that I find it difficult to make out what point you are making.
Are you for or against capitalism? Richard.

^Watch What You Say^: Criticism Under Attack ^ Object Magazine Special Issue

What is the function of arts criticism ^ or for that matter of critical
art ^ in light of recent events? White House press secretary Ari Fleischer
insists that in these bellicose times people have to ^watch what they say,
watch what they do.^ In the days following that remark, Aaron McGruder^s
comic strip, "The Boondocks," was yanked from newspapers for being critical
of the war, and a recent essay in the New York Times Book Review suggested
that the function of criticism is empathy. In this with-us or-against-us
moment, it seems that the very idea of criticism is under attack. For its
special theme issue, ^^Watch What You Say^: The Freedom of Criticism in the
New Era,^ Object magazine is seeking 800-1200 word essays that explore the
place of critical discourse in the post-September 11th world. We encourage
submissions from a wide range of  fields as well as those that look to art
as a medium of critical exchange.

Looking for a CV Builder? Want to beef up a portfolio with cultural
criticism? Dismayed by the current state of arts journalism? Object is a
project of the Arts Journalism Collective, a group focused on creating a
forum for arts and entertainment criticism vital for thriving arts
communities. Object strives to bridge the gaps between artists, audiences,
and critics from a wide variety of disciplines in and out of the ^academy^
as well as providing a training ground for writers, editors, photographers,
and designers in the field of arts journalism. Those interested in
submitting articles a well as those interested in our mission can contact

Ken Kesey was a big bear of a guy you couldn't miss around the Haight or at
the Fillmore Auditorium back in the 1960s. Ken Babbs posted this on his
Intrepid Trips site today, Nov. 10:


"Kesey's belly was hurting and the docs did a scan and found a black spot on
his liver. It was cancerous but encapsulated which meant there was no cancer
anywhere else. They decided to cut it out and the surgery went okay. He had
sixty percent of his liver left to carry the load but in one of those dirty
tricks the body can play on you everything else went to hell and this
morning at 3:45 AM his heart stopped beating.

"A great good friend and great husband and father and grand dad, he will be
sorely missed but if there is one thing he would want us to do it would be
to carry on his life's work. Namely to treat others with kindness and if
anyone does you dirt forgive that person right away. This goes beyond the
art, the writing, the performances, even the bus. Right down to the bone."

he's got a missile strapped to his other back,
don't worry, he'll get it on track,
you'll be there, in its glare

you'll be there, back in your home,
the world explodes, it's not another bomb

October 9 through December 2, 2001

In conjunction with an artist-in-residence project at Art in General,=20
Icelandic artist Sk=FAta is inviting artists to participate in the =
exhibition=20
FLUXUS GENETICS. Artists are invited to submit DOCUMENTATION of their =
work=20
to the FLUXUS GENETICS LABORATORIUM project, a curatorial performance=20
exploring how cultural lineages manifest themselves in artists' works.=20
Sk=FAta is attempting to trace the ancestry and posterity of the Fluxus=20
movement. In a process modeled on that of DNA analysis, Sk=FAta will =
analyze=20
submitted art works and slides to determine their cultural lineages,=20
concentrating on what he calls the "Fluxus Strain." Artists whose work=20
shows a strong Fluxus Strain will then be invited to use an adjacent =
living=20
room environment to exhibit their work for one week during the month of=20
November.

To be considered for review, artists need not think of their work as =
being=20
influenced by the Fluxus Movement. All work will be considered.=20
Documentation should be sent to : Lab Technician Sk=FAta, Labratorium, =

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Fluxus Genetics
October 9 through December 2, 2001

In a process modeled on that of DNA analysis, the New York-based artist=20
Sk=FAta will transform Gallery 4 into a laboratory equipped to trace the =

ancestry and posterity of the Fluxus movement in Fluxus genetics, on =
view=20
October 9 through December 2, 2001. Adopting the role of laboratory=20
technician, the artist will explore popular culture of the 1950s and =
1960s=20
to dissect the lineage of Fluxus and, at the same time, anatomize the =
work=20
of artists to determine the movement's aesthetic legacy. The first=20
component of Fluxus Genetics will be the search for the "parentage" of=20
Fluxus. In his role as laboratory technician, Sk=FAta will start with =
what=20
George Maciunas explicitly acknowledged as influences on Fluxus and will =

extend this map of Fluxus antecedents with his own research. The =
cultural=20
and artistic "genetic strains" discovered will be installed as a =
simulated=20
Living Room environment of the 1950s, with books, recordings, movies, TV =

programs and other objects serving as specimens of the cultural "DNA" =
that=20
spawned the Fluxus movement. In conjunction with Fluxus Genetics, the=20
Fluxus Archive, curated by Luiza Interlenghi (New York, NY) will consist =
of=20
a cabinet loaded with photos, texts and reproductions of original =
materials=20
from Fluxus artists. The information will be stored in a labyrinth of=20
different drawers and compartments in the cabinet and will serve as a=20
resource for tracing the emergence of the Fluxus experience. Adjacent to =

the Living Room created by Sk=FAta will be a second installation =
environment=20
entitled the "Laboratorium." In this "on-site lab," Sk=FAta will attempt =
to=20
trace Fluxus "DNA strains" in the work of contemporary artists. He will=20
review slide registries of contemporary artists, which will serve as =
large=20
scale "blood banks." In addition, Sk=FAta will invite individual artists =
to=20
bring or send documentation of their work to the "Laboratorium" for=20
in-depth genetic analysis seeking the Fluxus gene. The work of these=20
contemporary artists will be given an F.S. (Fluxus Strain) test, and=20
artists with strong F.S. results will then be invited to use the Living=20
Room environment to exhibit their work during the month of November.

I ran into a friend on Broadway this weekend, and we
were standing, chatting.  He, a painter, was telling
me that he's started a series of portraits from the
postage-stamp sized face photos of the Twin Towers
deceasad that the New York Times is printing daily.

I wanted to show him snapshots from the latest roll of
film that I'd developed but, as I was rummaging
through my black synthetic Bill Blass shoulderbag to
find them, my cigarette lighter or something fell out
of my hand or out from the bag onto the sidewalk.

My friend bent over and picked it up.

"What ~that,~ though?"  I asked, pointing.

There was something on the pavement an inch or two
over from where he'd just picked up what I dropped.
This time ~I~ leaned over.

And this (no joking) is what I found:

Hey Kathy Lou, I've used Poetry Writing: Theme & Variations for some classes
with great results, and perhaps a little too specific but still good (&
bossy!) in another context I used Edith Wharton's The Writing of Fiction, on
the rec of Lynne Tillman, and it worked quite well (this was a more advanced
class tho).
Have fun
Elizabeth Treadwell

To the Uzbekistani Soldier Who Would Not Save My Life

Susan Smith Nash
Pivotal Prose Series

Cover art by Basil King

Essays, meditations, travel notes, or chapters in a novella, these seven
pieces defy easy categorization. Our narrator (a certain Susan Smith =
Nash)
initially introduces herself as a resourceful, capable, sedated woman
turning 40,but the reader soon finds this thumbnail sketch unraveling. =
As
the narrator's obsessions drive her from Argentina to Mozambique, from
Uzbekistan to Oklahoma, nothing appears to satisfy her desire for
meaning-neither the burial practices of medieval Russian monks nor a
romance with a Paraguayan MCP. Nothing, that is, until she re-reads
Shakespeare's comedies.

Recording the unique perceptions of a woman addicted to relentless
exploration, this is a book of fierce honesty, a soul-baring performance
that manages to be both intellectually challenging and emotionally
quickening.

$9 * 67 pgs. * ISBN: 1-880713-29-2.

Publication Date: November 9, 2001 * Distributed by Small Press =

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 — President Bush signed an order today allowing special
military tribunals to try foreigners charged with terrorism. A senior
administration official said that any such trials would "not necessarily" be
public and that the American tribunals might operate in Pakistan and
Afghanistan.

At the same time, the Justice Department has asked law enforcement
authorities across the country to pick up and question 5,000 men, most from
Middle Eastern countries, who entered the country legally in the last two
years.

Both actions are part of a sweeping government effort to expand the
investigation into Al Qaeda's network and clear the way for the more
aggressive prosecution of anyone charged with terrorism.

Mr. Bush signed the order allowing for the military tribunals shortly before
leaving this afternoon for his ranch in Crawford, Tex. White House officials
said the order did not create a military tribunal or a list of terrorists to
be tried. Instead, they said, it was an "option" that the president would
have should Osama bin Laden or his associates in Al Qaeda be captured. If
the tribunals were created, it would be the first time since World War II
that such an approach was used, officials said.

Under the order, the president himself is to determine who is an accused
terrorist and therefore subject to trial by the tribunal. The order states
that the president may "determine from time to time in writing that there is
reason to believe" that an individual is a member of Al Qaeda, has engaged
in acts of international terrorism or has "knowingly harbored" a terrorist.

In order to make such a finding, the president needs information, and
obtaining information about Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11 terrorist acts is the
goal of the Justice Department's effort to find and interview the 5,000 men,
department officials said.

The people being sought are not believed to be terrorism suspects, and they
will not be placed under arrest, the officials said. The interviews are
intended to be voluntary.

Nonetheless, officials at the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the
Justice Department effort, as well as the executive order allowing military
tribunals.

Steven Shapiro, the national legal director of the A.C.L.U., called the
effort to interview the 5,000 men a "dragnet approach that is likely to
magnify concerns of racial and ethnic profiling."

Laura W. Murphy, the director of the A.C.L.U. Washington National Office,
described the order regarding tribunals as "deeply disturbing and further
evidence that the administration is totally unwilling to abide by the checks
and balances that are so central to our democracy."

White House officials said the tribunals were necessary to protect potential
American jurors from the danger of passing judgment on accused terrorists.
They also said the tribunals would prevent the disclosure of government
intelligence methods, which normally would be public in civilian courts.

"We have looked at this war very unconventionally," said Dan Bartlett, the
White House communications director, "and the conventional way of bringing
people to justice doesn't apply to these times."

The idea of using tribunals has been suggested by some lawyers outside the
government as well.

"It's the most pragmatic way and it's the most legally correct way to
adjudicate terrorist war crimes," said Spencer J. Crona, a Denver probate
lawyer and the co-author of a 1996 article in the Oklahoma City University
Law Journal arguing the merits of military tribunals to try terrorists.

Mr. Crona and his co-author, Neal A. Richardson, a deputy district attorney
in Denver, have continued to promote the idea, most recently in an opinion
article in September in The Los Angeles Times. Mr. Crona added that
terrorists are not "mere criminals" but enemy agents engaged in war crimes
against Americans.

But experts in military law said the tribunals would severely limit the
rights of any defendant even beyond those in military trials. The tribunals,
they said, did not provide for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and
would not require strict rules of evidence like those in military and
civilian courts.

"The accused in such a court would have dramatically fewer rights than a
person would in a court- martial," said Eugene R. Fidell, the president of
the National Institute of Military Justice.

Mr. Fidell said he expected the order to be challenged in court, adding, "It
establishes a court that departs in important respects from core aspects of
American criminal justice."

Mindy Tucker, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said tribunals would not
"preclude any Justice Department options" but would be an "additional tool."

"These are obviously extraordinary times and the president needs to have as
many options as possible," Ms. Tucker said.

In signing the military order, a highly unusual act by a president, Mr. Bush
invoked his constitutional authority as commander in chief as well as the
resolution authorizing military force passed by Congress on Sept. 15.
Congress has not passed a formal declaration of war, and military law
experts said one was not necessary for Mr. Bush's order.

White House officials said that there was precedent for the military
tribunals and that they had been approved by the Supreme Court, first in
1801. Those accused of plotting the assassination of Abraham Lincoln were
also tried and convicted by a military court, Bush administration officials
said.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, White House officials said, had German
saboteurs tried by a military court in World War II; six of them were
executed. The Supreme Court upheld the proceeding, saying that people who
entered the United States to wage war were combatants who could be tried in
a military court.

"What would you do if you caught bin Laden?" one administration official
said tonight. "This is an additional option that is being provided by this
order."

Administration officials said a long, public trial might turn Mr. bin Laden
into a martyr, and could cause further terrorism in his name.

The names of the 5,000 people that the Justice Department wants to interview
were compiled from immigration and State Department records of people who
entered the United States since Jan. 1, 2000, on tourist, student or
business visas. Only men aged 18 to 33 with these visas who are living in
the United States are on the list.

The names of the countries whose citizens have been placed on the list were
not made public, but most are Middle Eastern nations thought to have
harbored followers of Mr. bin Laden or to have been used by Al Qaeda as a
staging base for activities in the United States.

Ms. Tucker, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said she hoped some of the
men would help the government thwart further attacks.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, an Islamic advocacy group based
in Washington, expressed concern about the plan and said the government
should publish guidelines for these interviews, including the right of those
being interviewed to have legal representation.

"This type of sweeping investigation carries with it the potential to create
the impression that interviewees are being singled out because of their
race, ethnicity or religion," said Nihad Awad, the group's executive
director.

On Capitol Hill, the issue of who is entering the country illegally was in
the forefront today, with senators sharply questioning a senior official of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service who acknowledged that immigration
agents were not required to conduct criminal background checks on immigrants
caught crossing the border illegally.

The official, Michael A. Pearson, the executive associate commissioner for
field operations, said agents could use their discretion as to whether such
a person should be detained or let go pending further action.

Mr. Pearson said that 12,338 undocumented immigrants were arrested for
illegal entry along the nation's northern border in the last fiscal year,
and that two-thirds of them agreed to return voluntarily to their home
countries. But he was not able to account for the 4,400 people who did not
choose to return home voluntarily.

Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Senate's
permanent subcommittee on investigations, responded, "I find that
disturbing, to put it mildly."

Questioned by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Mr. Pearson said
it was true that the I.N.S. had no ability to verify that illegal immigrants
who were let go but told to leave the country actually did leave.

Ms. Collins replied, "If there's no system for checking if the individual
has actually left in the 30 days as promised, isn't it likely they are not
leaving?"

Mr. Pearson said, "That could certainly be the case."

Cid Corman, b. 1924, was born in Boston, and received his B.A. from Tufts.
He did graduate work at the University of Michigan, where he won the
Hopwood Award for Poetry, and the University of North Carolina. Throughout
the 1950's and 1960's Corman's magazine ORIGIN published some of the major
works of the Black Mountain poets, as well as other important work,
choosing mostly poems not yet readily available elsewhere: the early poetry
of Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Denise Levertov with the late works
of Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams. He carried on a fascinating
correspondence with Stevens, who greatly respected what Origin was doing.
Corman has published over seventy volumes of poetry, translated several
French and Japanese poets, and published four volumes of essays. He has
lived in Kyoto, Japan since 1958 where he and his wife run a business, Cid
Corman's Dessert Shop. Corman is one of "late" modernism's most significant
enablers, a poet of talent himself, and a master of "production" -- whose
work, both as poet and publisher, is intertwined with the Objectivists
Zukofsky and Oppen, as well as Creeley and Olson. Among those poetic
colleagues and many younger poets worldwide, Corman's verse is perhaps the
most committed to the sublime, refusing the temptation of "effect" for the
tactile ink of line and "touch." His collection Nothing Doing is full of
poetry of cognitive conundrum, but also of uncompromising wisdom, where
Corman can definitively declare: "There's only / one poem: / this is it."

Corman was one of the first to theorize what modernist verse can do on the
radio. In Poetry (1952) he wrote a piece on poetry and radio that reads, in
part: "What few poets seem to realize is that radio is their best potential
outlet these days. It puts the stress rightly on the spoken word, tests the
imagination of writer and listener spoken revives the need of the
oral-aural commitment in verse, and permits the largest possible audience
to experience the poem. As a rare diet, of course, it undermines itself.
But there is no reason today, under sincere and determined effort, that
good poetry programs should not be available throughout the country. They
con be noncommercial sustaining programs, like This Is Poetry. Nearly three
years ago I initiated my weekly broadcasts, known as This Is Poetry, from
WMEX (1510 kc.) in Boston. The program has been usually a fifteen-minute
reading of modern verse on Saturday evenings at seventhirty; however, I
have taken some liberties and have read from Moby Dick and from stories by
Dylan Thomas, Robert Creeley, and Joyce. In the approximately 150 programs
to date, during which I have had the opportunity to improve my delivery and
to appreciate oral detail, I have offered the program to many guest poets,
to read and discuss their work. About a third of the programs have been of
this kind. My guests have included such writers as John Crowe Ransom,
Archibald MacLeish, Stephen Spender, John Ciardi, Theodore Roethke, Pierre
Emmanuel, Allan Curnow, Richard Wilbur, Richard Eberbart, Katherine
Hoskins, and Vincent Ferrini. A number of the programs have been bilingual,
in English and French, Spanish, German, or Italian. I have had young but
highly qualified persons, native to the tongues, read the originals against
my reading of translations. Programs have been given to Corbiere, Eluard,
Lorca, Ungaretti, Benn, and others. Imagine hearing Claudio Guillen, son of
Jorge Guillen, read a poem that Lorca wrote for him when he was a child in
Spain...."

My friend Kim is teaching a unit on rhythm and meter in poetry.  She is
looking for interesting ways to get her students jazzed about this. I have
tried to share with her some scansion ideas, but I've actually never taught
meter myself.  Have any of you teachers out there done this, and if so, do
you have any specific ideas?

Time is of the essence, since the class is on Wednesday. I believe the
setting is a community college.

Please backchannel freely!

WALDMAN and LEWIS WARSH from the rare original magazines and books,
this large and generous publication, Jerome Rothenberg has praised,
"is not only an archival masterpiece-the best of a time that's now
gone though scarce forgotten - but an incitement to keep their work
alive for a still newer generation." With readings by ANNE WALDMAN,
LEWIS WARSH, TONY TOWLE, MARY FERRARI, RON PADGET, MICHAEL
BROWNSTEIN, BOB ROSENTHAL, WILLIAM CORBETT, JAMES KOLLER, LARRY

Project members. Schedule is subject to change)



"Angel Hair reaches us now from a moment in American history that is
still a part of our cultural & spiritual present. Under the care of
Anne Waldman & Lewis Warsh young poets in what was, circa 1965, the
hot center of a "new" "American" "poetry" their economically printed
& exuberantly disseminated magazine was a key vehicle for the
innovative & groundbreaking work of an entire generation of poets &
artists. This large & generous anthology is not only an archival
masterpiece the best of a time that's now gone though scarce
forgotten but an incitement to keep their work alive for a still
newer generation. Hurrahs & kudos to all appearing here & to Granary
Books for bravely bringing them forward."

NOTICE TO RECIPIENTS OF LATEST SAMIZDAT AND CHAPBOOK TITLED "SO THE ANTS MADE
IT TO THE CAT FOOD"

It is with sincere regret that I must let the recipients of the above (who
are subscribers to this listserve) know that the chapbook in question,
published in recognition of my "Anti-Laureateship," is a CORRUPT TEXT, due to
unfortunate mishaps, I gather, encountered by the editor, the esteemed Robert
Archambeau, in its production.   I shall let him provide more detailed
explanations of this disaster, minor, it is true, sub specie aeternitatis,
but a disaster nevertheless.

The typos, accidental deletions, etc. are beyond any remedy by an "Errata
Sheet," and the undersigned author is negotiating with the publisher for the
production of a true and correct(ed) version of the work, copies of which
will be distributed to the recipients of the next issue of Samizdat.

Yours in the Anti-Matter,

Anselm Hollo

"Where a chain of events appears to us, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling
wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay,
awaken the dead, and join together what has been smashed to pieces. But a storm is blowing
from Paradise and irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned,
while the pile of ruins before him grows and grows skyward. What we call progress is this
storm."
Walter Benjamin describing his "angel of history" in the ninth of his Theses on the
Philosophy of History.

CALL FOR  SUBMISSIONS

Perspectives on Evil and Human Wickedness  (PEHW)
ISSN: 1471-5597
Volume 2. : June 2002  (themed issue:  Terrorism)
Submissions (along with a biographical blurb) are due on April 1, 2002


Perspectives on Evil and Human Wickedness publishes scholarly and
creative work, personal reflections, and practitioners' accounts
relating to classifying, defining, and probing different aspects of
evil. It aims to shed light on the genesis and manifestations of evil as
well as on the diverse angles from which humans can understand, tackle,
surmount, or come to terms with it. Perspectives on Evil and Human
Wickedness does not espouse any ideological viewpoint or favor any
specific theoretical framework, but interrogates a plurality of
perspectives aimed at advancing research on this topic.

Submissions are sought for the June 2002 volume to be devoted entirely
to the theme of terrorism. The volume hopes to present a panoply of
possible angles from which to engage this timely topic.  A wide array of
relevant theoretical, critical and professional perspectives is,
therefore, encouraged.  Of most interest will be contributions that add
to, alter and/or deepen, our current understanding of the phenomenon of
terrorism.

Topics may include:

Labels and Definition(s)
Binary thinking and cultural stereotypes in the discourse on terrorism
Manichean visions of good and evil
Clash of civilizations scenarios
Leitmotifs, imagery and rhetoric in the political discourse on terrorism
Globalized terror
Jihad, Islamic fundamentalism and culture of shame
Terrorism and Late Capitalism
Gendering terrorism
Cyber terrorism
Virtual terrorism in film
Terrorism in the media
Religious/philosophical/historical/legal perspectives on terrorism
Socio-political analysis of root causes


For further details and information regarding this issue, please

doctor i get these fevers constantly; i'm under tremendous stress. i've
taken my art as far as i can - i'm not even sure it's art anymore. sexual
nakedness repeats itself into infinity; my recent presentations carry the
repetition as i*i*i traveling back and forth across the imaginary. there's
no end to it. i don't sleep well. i'm shaky. my vision produces peripheral
illusions. there are headaches, chills. i take codeine. i take coffee. i
produce.

i say this because of sleeplessness. i'm always on the verge of breakdown.
i want all the bodies in the world bought and sold. i want the sex and the
guns. i want the sweetness and collections of late-night promises. i want
tender farewells and corpses.

there are no other reasons. beneath the skin, there's skin. flesh cuts
into flesh, organ into organ. two cells occupy the same space. they love
it.

there's room for everyone. nothing but the chills which i have to great
degree. they don't disappear. at night i twist until my body becomes
someone else. that person fucks and dies. that persons buys and sells,
this is all contract. live within my means.

i came broken to you because there's no choice. nothing comes and nothing
goes. i see brutal mountains. no vegetation. i want the bodies there. to
come to me. bought and sold. there's room for everything in the desert.
they have visions in the desert. i want the visions.

yes.

i've ceased crying long ago. others cry for me. they see for me. i am an
other. i am written for. i am naked, fucking. they provide me. i die. they
die. it makes a seal, contract. i endure. i come to you.

some woman. some man. sometimes the same.

collapse of day. the fever is furious. i do nothing less than this. i
create the conditions. i collapse them. the hunger continues. you are too
cold.

mountains and night. live within the other's means. i collapse them.

go through, doctor. don't ask. don't tell. i won't say a word.


I don't understand and oh I want to.

From issue # 5 of -VeRT Magazine : http://www.litvert.com/issue_5.html

Behind the Meatball Curtain

by Andrew Felsinger

I published the following poem in Issue #4 of -VeRT Magazine as having been
written by John Ashbery :

"Meatball Curtain"

Literally, they say, "choked."
But pissing into the snow loosens nothing up.
I mean I; the reason why this remoteness
Haloes the how the day went,
Mathematical probability of the
Sound attached to the Seine's hypotenuse of ice
And the grafittoed monuments
Experienced as examined pulses, signals
To be precipitated in desire
The way a name gets spelled out magically
In blotto green light the sleet sparkles across.

But must admit I don't know for sure who wrote the poem. Is Jacques Debrot
the author? He has similarly written both sides of an interview with John
Ashbery, published by 2nd Story Books.

I knew the poem could be of dubious authorship, but chose to publish the
work nonetheless. It contains a clumsy elegance that I also recognize and
enjoy in Ashbery's work. I like to think of "Meatball Curtain" as something
that perhaps Ashbery could have jotted down, a minor yet worthy work allowe=
d
to slip from his desk, a poem pinned to his corpus, an homage to the
intricacies (mysteries) of identity and art.

But a poet researched the work and was offended by this coloring outside th=
e
lines. The work has been subject to a lather of Listronics (See
August/September) as well threat of a lawsuit. There have also been claims
that "Meatball Curtain" somehow hurts or annoys John Ashbery himself! I hav=
e
been, therefore, asked to remove John Ashbery's name from "Meatball Curtain=
"
and make this retraction.

I was struck by such information. In an earlier and "legitimate" interview
in Jacket Magazine Ashbery professes his admiration for literary frauds.
What is more, Ashbery's work often displays a sort sliding / unidentifiable
personal pronoun, (the very opposite of "I mean I"?) in which it is perhaps
understandable to imagine this next step, of abstracted authorship, as
inevitable.

What is more, John Ashbery is not known to use computers. How would he know
of this new, West Coast, poetry web 'zine? It seems far afield. I can not
seriously imagine John Ashbery pensively reading "Meatball Curtain" and
wondering over its supposed prescient and nefarious contents.

One possible explanation may be that such work requires scandal. Note the
following email :

Dear Jacques,

You interviewed me, and I showed you around the apartment, even letting you
browse the rarest, most limited-edition books. And then you changed certain
things I said. I left it well enough alone, even against my deeper
instincts. But please don't take the confidence too far. I understand from
Andrew Felsinger of VeRT magazine, that you intend to publish there a poem =
I
sent you three years ago, specifically designated for your now-defunct
magazine. I would remind you of copyright conventions, in case you have
forgotten (or didn't know about them?). Let me tell you that when Frank was
laid out, the long suture lines along his joints were like mountain ranges.
"What about our vacation in Kabul?" he breathed, a hundred martinis on his
breath. "Go back to sleep," I wept.And anyway, the poem was written by
Joseph Ceravolo before he died. Plus, I don't appreciate being made a part
of some obscene charade about Jacques Lacan, especially when the matter has
insulted people in England with whom I have close relationships, like Peter
Riley and Lawrence Upton. I'm sending this through Kent Johnson, whoever he
is, since I am not subscribed to Listbot, even though I know who Jordan
Davis is, of course, through Kenneth.

John


The above email is the work, obviously, of Kent Johnson. It was posted to
the British-Poets Listserve in order, I surmise, to stir up interest in
"Meatball Curtain," which at the time was about to be published in Issue #4
of -VeRT Magazine. The email is interesting in a number of ways: It states
that the poem was "written by Joseph Ceravolo before he died." And there is
this reference to "Frank"? Well, as interesting as this may be, I don't hav=
e
the inclination to follow up these leads, if that is what they are? I am no=
t
as interested in the poem's creation as I am in the authorless fiction that
allows for this semi-stateless object to float in an Ashberian ether. In a
kind of no-zone.

To expose this poem as a fraud is, perhaps, part of *the plan*? To, somehow=
,
square this circle. If so, then, I've done this, my part.

Rape of 'tat' - tv anthrax-terror


this is your show doctor. i'm here for the ride.

Is it because you wanted to see my reactions you wanted to see me naked
you wanted to see what I have to say that you came naked and broken to me?

Does it bother you that you wanted to fuck me you dream of me all the time
I have the power?

i love it. it doesn't bother me at all. fuck me and kill me. in the middle
of abc. in the middle of cbs. i don't care. i want you. in the middle of
the air. in the middle of nbc.

Earlier you said you wanted to see my reactions you wanted to see me naked
you wanted to see what I have to say?

Oh oh I do see so...  Well, what makes you yearn and cry that this is so?

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some girl
related to this.

there's no girl. you're the girl. in the middle of fox. i want you to fuck
me. in the middle of the air. in the middle of cnn. i want you in me. i
want you to kill me.

This is a healthy and so true way of thinking. What makes you believe it's
true there's no other way to think? When did you first know that you want
me to fuck you you want me to say this I am the girl you want me in you
you want me to kill you? In the middle of fox air. In the middle of cnn.
Are you afraid of sex? Why not? You mentioned that you wanted to fuck me
you dream of me all the time I have the power?

Oh oh yes, ahhh...  Are you sure that this is so? Tell me about something
about your sexual history. I would appreciate so very much it if you would
expose yourself about your sex life and body... Discuss your feelings
about your sexual partner. Tell me more and more about your most intense
sexual experience.

Have you been satisfied with your partner... ? Is it because of your life
that you are going through all this? Have you been frightened by sex?
Elaborate on more about your sexual history. Perhaps you could oh please
describe your sex life and body...

it came from the moment of the explosion. in the middle of the air i swal-
low radio. in the middle of the air i swallow television. screams. i knew
from the abc rape the nbc rape the cbs rape. i knew from the fox rape the
cnn rape. i knew.

Tell me about your apprehensions toward your sexual partner. Expose your-
self about your most neurotically stimulating sexual experience. Are you
satisfied with your partner... ? Have you been scared of sex? Discuss how
you feel about your sexual history. Please, tell me more and more about
your sex life and body...

Elaborate on your thoughts on your sexual partner. Describe your most
exciting sexual experience. Have you been satisfied with your partner... ?
Are you aroused by sex? Tell me about something about your sexual history.

I have also noticed how ants: those dark ambiguous crawlers on the face, do
indeed "make it", as it is said, to the cat food or those or that part or
parts of the generally corrupted cat food which by the time this occurs is
fly  gathering into the bargain: but a CORRUPT TEXT.............now such a
thing is an abomination in the sight - have you checked with what's left of
the Taleban and the Bush Administration as to whether such a document is
seditious or even, gott help us, actually naughty? I'd proceed with great
caution and after considerable deliberation (if I you were), despite your
status, undoubtedly deserved, as the anti laureate. WE do not want to greive
over thy wreathes.....but elsewise all is well here in Mad Land. Yours,
irrelevantly, Richard.

               CIA tried to listen to Soviets with

               BY CHARLOTTE EDWARDES

               LONDON--The CIA tried to uncover the Kremlin's deepest
secrets during the
               1960s by turning cats into walking bugging devices,
recently declassified documents
               show.

               In one experiment during the Cold War, a cat, dubbed
"Acoustic Kitty," was wired
               up for use as an eavesdropping platform.

               It was hoped that the animal, which was surgically
altered to accommodate
               transmitting and control devices, could listen to secret
conversations from window
               sills, park benches or dustbins.

               Victor Marchetti, a former CIA officer, said that Project
Acoustic Kitty was a
               gruesome creation.

               "They slit the cat open, put batteries in him, wired him
up. The tail was used as an
               antenna. They made a monstrosity. They tested him and
tested him. They found he
               would walk off the job when he got hungry, so they put
another wire in to override
               that,'' he said.

               Marchetti said that the first live trial was an expensive
disaster. The technology is
               thought to have cost more than $14 million.

               He said: "They took it out to a park and put him out of
the van, and a taxi comes
               and runs him over. There they were, sitting in the van
with all those dials, and the
               cat was dead.''

               The document, which was one of 40 to be declassified from
the CIA's closely
               guarded Science and Technology Directorate, where spying
techniques are refined,
               is still partly censored.

               This implies that the CIA was embarrassed about
disclosing all the details of
               Acoustic Kitty, which took five years to design.

               The memo ends by congratulating the team who worked on
the Acoustic Kitty
               project for its hard work.

               It says: "The work done on this problem over the years
reflects great credit on the
               personnel who guided it . . . whose energy and
imagination could be models for
               scientific pioneers.''

               By coincidence, in 1966, a British film called "Spy With
a Cold Nose" featured a
               dog wired up to eavesdrop on the Russians.

               It was the same year as the Acoustic Kitty was tested.

I'm working on a weird little project for which I need some birthday
information that I haven't been able to locate on the web.

Does anyone know the birth (and in some cases death) year of...

Isidore Isou (the founder of lLettrism)

John Mellancamp (pop singer, author of "Hurts So Good")

Joel Lewis (the poet from New Jersey)

Leon Theremin (inventor of the Theremin)

Maurice Martenot (inventor of the Ondes Martenot, something like a Theremin)

Al Hirschfield (cartoonist for the New York Times)

Also, this club is going to use Dreamlife of Letterrs for one of their
music/art events on November 18th -- details to follow.  Not sure if this is
simply corny, but it's kind of fun:

I probably won't be at this, my own gig, until about 8 or so, so if you are
stopping by to say hello, don't come until then.

Also, this is NOT a reading -- it's just standing around, listening to
tunes, drinking, looking at a tv set that has a poem playing on it -- every
seat in this lounge has its own tv and a controller so you can spy on other
people in the bar.  The cameras look like tiny cannons.  It's really fun.

I know some of you will be at the Zinc -- wish I could be there myself, hope
it goes well.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64663-2001Nov8.html

   By George Lardner Jr.
   Washington Post Staff Writer
   Friday, November 9, 2001; Page A01

   The Justice Department has decided to listen in on the conversations
   of lawyers with clients in federal custody, including people who have
   been detained but not charged with any crime, whenever that is deemed
   necessary to prevent violence or terrorism.

   Attorney General John D. Ashcroft approved the eavesdropping rule on
   an emergency basis last week, without the usual waiting period for
   public comment. It went into effect immediately, permitting the
   government to monitor conversations and intercept mail between people
   in custody and their attorneys for up to a year at a time.

   The move, which the Justice Department said was necessary "in view of
   the immediacy of the dangers to the public," stunned defense lawyers
   and civil libertarians. They assailed it as an unconstitutional attack
   on the right to counsel and, in the words of American Civil Liberties
   Union official Laura W. Murphy, "a terrifying precedent."

   The monitoring of attorney-client conversations is the latest in a
   series of extraordinary law enforcement measures the government has
   taken in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and
   Washington.

hello all,

i'm looking for suggestions to pass along to a friend who is interested
in publishing her english translation of rene char's final, posthumously
published work, eloge d'une soupconnee. the original is a short (25pp)
collection of poems and aphorisms; with french and english texts en face
and a substantial introduction the resulting translation would total
maybe 70-80 pages. permissions from the french publisher (gallimard)
have not been secured.

any and all ideas welcome.

much thanks,
tom orange

An election correction

Nov 15th 2001
From The Economist print edition



In the issues of December 16th 2000 to November 10th 2001, we may have given
the impression that George Bush had been legally and duly elected president
of the United States. We now understand that this may have been incorrect,
and that the election result is still too close to call. The Economist
apologises for any inconvenience.

EXIT ART  INVITES YOU TO PARTICIPATE   -   PLEASE FORWARD


R E A C T I O N  S

November 2001




We are living in a  historical moment. The essence of life has changed. The
world's psyche has been  irrevocably altered.



In this new era, Exit Art,  as a cultural space near the World Trade
Center, feels an obligation to  interpret or translate the feelings of a
larger community into a collective  expression of analysis. We want to know
how the events of September 11 have  altered your behavior -- toward
others, your city, your daily life -- how the  events changed your
perception of reality and the world around you.



A change of behavior is a  change of culture, which is why Exit Art is
organizing a global project called  REACTIONS. This project aims to be an
international response from both  inside and outside the art world, a
reflection of how these events have changed  your life.



We want to hear and share  your reactions.



We are inviting you to  participate in REACTIONS by submitting your
response on a flat, 8-1/2 x  11" sheet of paper. Your submission can take
the form of a letter, text,  drawing, poem, painting, collage, photograph,
or any other format that can fit  on a piece of paper. REACTIONS will be an
exhibition on view at Exit Art  in New York City from January 12 - March
30, 2002. All responses will be  exhibited.



Your visual and poetic work  will be put into a context of historical
witness. We hope that like us, you feel  a sense of urgency to respond and
participate in this necessary, collective  expression.



Your effort will be  valued; your voice will be heard.








Jeanette        Ingberman and Papo Colo
Co-Directors, Exit Art

Exhibition Coordinators





SUBMISSIONS
Submit your 8-1/2 x 11" response (or  European letter-size equivalent) via
post, email, or in person. Please note that  your submissions will be kept
by Exit Art and will not be returned. By  submitting responses, you are
giving Exit Art all rights to your work, which may  include publication and
tour. Responses must be received by January 1,  2002. Three-dimensional or
oversized responses will NOT be accepted.

COME TO THE FORUM: ARTS AND DISCOURSE IN THE WARTIME
In connection with the MA/PhD Lecture Series we are organizing an
additional discussion forum--"Arts and Discourse in the Wartime."  The
forum will happen on November 20, from 5:30-8:30 in Rarig Center on the
West  Bank of the U of M.  This forum is one of the many already organized
on  campus, and brings us closer to the concerns shared by other members of
the  University.  We hope to discuss the issues of intellectual and
artistic  responsibility which we all face at the present moment.  In the
wake of  distressing current events, this meeting is meant to create a
space to ask  questions, express opinions, and hear responses from people
who have an  experience in addressing political conflicts in their art and
scholarship.
The forum will consist of a panel of artists and professors >from  Augsburg
College, St. Catherine's College, MCAD, Stanford University, and the
University of Minnesota.  A reception and a second session, in which
students and invited artists present their work, will follow the panel
discussion.  Please come and join us.
Please forward this announcement to any and all interested  parties.

Book Launch for Anarcho-Modernism
Toward a New Critical Theory

This volume is a collection of 38 pieces unified by a combination of the
playful, primitive aesthetic of literary modernism with the
anti-authoritarian, anarchist praxis of radical democratic politics. This
bi-polar sensibility permeates the work of Jerry Zaslove, to whom the book
is dedicated. Yet even if this sensibility pervades the book, the ideas
presented here are all animated by highly conflicting attempts to articulate
rigorously the anarcho-modernist stance, its literary forms and its
political implications and values. In particular, all the contributors
explore the fundamental tension that defines our new century--between
bureaucratization and industrialization on the one hand, and the critical
and autonomous individual on the other. The five sections of the work focus
on: The Industrialization of Culture; Literature and Aesthetics; Public
Education and Literacy; Human Rights and Politics; and Anarchism and
Friendship. Whatever holds together the anarchist solidarity represented in
this collection, it isn't a "principle," a generality that is made to apply
equally to all comers. It's a particular relation, an affinity, that perhaps
can be approached through thinking about friendship as a utopia of the near,
the particular, and the concrete--not as a system of generalities for all.
This guiding orientation is vital for the reconstruction of a critical
theory adequate for our own time.

WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 14 at 8PM

BENJAMIN BINSTOCK
"Writing (to) Vermeer"

Vermeer is a text, which we write each time anew, based on historical
works.
Vermeer is also a paradigmatic text, implicated in the texts "art
history" and
"art," which implies that there is a lot at stake in the works. Benjamin
Binstock
offers to look (with you) anew at these works, at the relation of
Vermeerís biography
to his works, and at his representation of this relation. Most
provocatively, Binstock
will propose that some of the works now incorporated in the text
"Vermeer" were
painted by his daughter, Maria Vermeer. These paintings were a way of
writing to
Vermeer (as is also Binstock's presentation). The works of the Vermeers
are
historical; the text "Vermeers" is contemporary. That is not the same as
fiction
about the Vermeers, as in Peter Greenawayís opera libretto, although
this opera
significantly exemplifies how the contemporary text "art" and the text
"contemporary
art" are inextricable from historical works.

Benjamin Binstock teaches art history and critical theory at New York
University.
His writing and interests range from the history of art history to
contemporary
cultural studies, psychoanalysis, and deconstruction, viewed through and
as a means
of viewing the rich material of Renaissance, Baroque and Modern art. He
has
translated the great Viennese formalist art historian Aloïs Riegl and is
currently
editing and will introduce a new translation of Riegl's "Historical
Grammar of the
Visual Arts." Last year, Binstock initiated a month-long series of
inter-disciplinary
symposia, exhibitions, and performances devoted to the work of Jacques
Derrida
at NYU and cultural institutions in downtown New York. This year he is
completing
his revisionist and iconoclastic study, Art as Life: The paintings of
Johannes and Maria
Vermeer. For this series Binstock will examine issues of interpretation
of Vermeerís
paintings, specifically in relation to the themes of reading and
writing, as paradigmatic
of fundamental problems in art history today.

Spiral Bridge extends great gratitude to all those who helped to make our November Naked Reading such an overwhelming success.

We are pleased to announce the second workshop of our Fall Workshop Series:

Ekphrastic Poetry: A Living Collaborative

This month we will explore the ways writers may enter into a collaborative communication with visual artists through writing on, to, and in communication with their work.

We are excited to have the oppurtunity to be invited as guests of the Newark Museum, located in Newark's downtown/arts section, and on the web at www.newarkmuseum.org.

The workshop group will meet Sunday, November 18th at 1 pm at The Space, 18 Broad Street, Bloomfield, NJ, and then will travel as a group to the museum. Should interested writers wish to meet us directly at the museum, we will meet at 2 pm in the Main Lobby.

At the museum, we will discuss, as a workshop group, the ways in which poets have used ekphrasis, or poetry about art, to communicate with, reflect upon, and breathe a life
of new sensory dimensions into the works of visual artists,  contemporary and passed.

We will look at the ways in which established writers including but not limited to: Frank O'Hara, William Carlos Williams, and Wislawa Szymborska, have intuitively added sensory dimensions to the already poignant work of these artists.

We will then break and be "let loose," so to speak, upon the museum's extensive collection of visual art and attempt our own communications and collaboratives.
The workshop will conclude with discussion and sharing of each other's creations.

Please bring a notebook, pen, your beautiful and creative selves,
and anything else you may need to write.
Anyone in need of a ride
should feel free to contact us at:
Spiralbridge@hotmail.com

In the interests of time, space, travel, and the creative process, please be prompt...

A double-issue of _The Gig_ magazine is in preparation, with a planned
publication date of March 2003. This will be a perfectbound book of essays
on the work of Tom Raworth. Tom has published over 40 volumes of poetry and
prose, and has been active for four decades as an editor, publisher,
printer, visual artist, collaborator and translator; his books include _The
Relation Ship_, _A Serial Biography_, _Moving_, _Act_, _Ace_, _Writing_,
_Clean & Well Lit_ and a selected poems, _Tottering State_ (now in its 3rd
edition, from O Books). _The Gig_'s special issue will be the first
substantial collection of criticism and commentary on a body of writing that
has been widely influential and admired on both sides of the Atlantic and in
many languages. The issue will be budgeted for 250-300pp.  A tentative list
of contributors: Nigel Alderman, Rae Armantrout, John Barrell, cris cheek,

Geoff Ward, John Wilkinson and Tim Woods.

_The Gig_ needs advance support to ensure the publication of this book. (It
is a Canadian publication, and thus not eligible for public funding for
books concerning British authors.) The advance subscription price is $20
Canadian dollars/$15 US dollars (prices includes airmail within North
America); or for overseas =A313/$28 Cdn (includes airmail overseas). This
amount may of course be increased by anyone who wishes thus to support the
venture, and such support will be acknowledged.

(NB: Copies of _The Gig_'s previous double-issue are still available, a
232pp volume of essays on the poetry of Peter Riley. Advance subscribers to
the Raworth volume may additionally purchase the Riley volume for a
specially reduced price of $15 Cdn/$10 US in North America, or =A39/$20 Cdn.=

           the first fall 2001 CPC dialogue series featuring
      Huang Chih -Yang (Taiwan), Emiko Kasahara (Japan), Gerard Pas
     (Netherlands/Canada), and Asya Reznikov (Russia) on the panel.

 This dialogue will take place at WHITE BOX 525 West 26th Street (10 -11
                                 Ave.)
       Artists and the public will interact in a discussion about
      interpretations of the human body in art. The artist's unique
 backgrounds provide an exciting opportunity to question and examine the
 process by which life becomes art. The dialogue is open to the public,
 and will be filmed for inclusion in the documentation of our fall 2001
                    exhibition series "Identities."

and alienation, attempting to position the individual within the context
     of both modern and ancient forms of tribalism, nationalism, and
  globalism. ALL ACCESS challenges participants to reconsider regional,
                 race-based and religious assumptions.

Arlen lives and works in a large, Eastern metropolis.  One of our favorite
poets, Arlen has a 12-minute, 44,000 Hz 16-bit audio on Frequency, worth
listening to!







So he spends the first 15 minutes attempting to prove an Iraqi connection
to the anthrax, which connection "is becoming increasingly clear."
Despite the fact it looks a lot like a 73-year-old cracker living alone in
his trailer someplace, uh, South and listening to Rush on a regular basis.

Then he slagged some "infobabe" on ABC for mistakenly telling her peers
Cokie Roberts had received a suspect letter from Trenton.  She's been
suspended by ABC, Rush approving reports.  He also carried on about ABC's
News Prez (What is it with ABC these days?  They're upstanding capitalist
organs) who had "no opinion" to a student's question whether the Pentagon
was a "legitimate target" or not.  He should have clicked his heels,
snapped his right arm up, palm down, and said, "I will give my life and
the life of my corporation for the Little Colonel, whether he lead us
against evildoers in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Berkley."  Well, that last is
really me, but nothing less would have satisfied Rush.

This from the a guy who broadcast for three hours nationally that Hillary
Clinton had murdered Vince Foster in her Georgetown apartment and had the
body moved by the Secret Service to a park someplace.

Every experience is to some extent regrettable, although
I am enjoying myself.  Yes,
the mind is a terrible thing.
Yesterday our beloved president announced that
"All missions are being conducted according to
plan on the military front."  Period.  And I have lived long to
recognize that pattern of voice which somehow always innocently
precedes great disaster.
The glorious victories of the Russian army in 1914.
"Why did two separate cultures, thousands of
miles apart, both invent pyramids?  And
Did it have anything to do with Atlantis?"
No.

She went to Vassar,
I went to driving school.
So there we were, our
naughty parts all engorged and
tingly.  Questions
I never want to answer,
#14:
"Is that plutonium on your gums?"
It's Saturday afternoon.
Sal and Harriet are listening to
"Workers and the Challenge of Globalization"
on the radio.
You know you have a drinking problem when
the bartender knows your name and
you've never been there before.

Right---Ron, no comment is needed because this it is certainly not
an example of "left fundamentalism" to support this stamp
because even George W.....SAYS that Muslim-Americans are not the enemy...

>Directives from Attorney General Ashcroft's speech before EOUSA's
>Anti-Terrorism Coordinators Conference
>
>
>November 13, 2001
>
>
>
>MEMORANDUM TO ALL UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS
>
>FROM:   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
>
>SUBJECT:        Cooperation with State and Local Officials in the Fight
>Against Terrorism
>
>
>         The September 11 attacks demonstrate that the war on
>terrorism  must be fought and won at home as well as abroad.  To meet this
>new threat and to prevent future attacks, law enforcement officials at all
>levels of government -- federal, state, and local -- must work together,
>sharing information and resources needed both to arrest and prosecute the
>individuals responsible and to detect and destroy terrorist cells before
>they can strike again.
>
>          On October 26, 2001, the President signed into law the USA
>PATRIOT Act of 2001.  A key feature of this anti-terrorism legislation is
>its provisions requiring increased sharing of information among law
>enforcement and national security personnel at all levels of
>government.  These measures, proposed by the President, are critical to the
>common effort to prevent and disrupt terrorist acts.  To win the war on
>terrorism, federal prosecutors and law enforcement personnel must develop
>and implement effective procedures for information-sharing and cooperation
>with their state and local counterparts.  I therefore direct you to take
>prompt action in three major areas:
>
>         1.  Designation of Chief Information Officer.  To centralize the
>process by which information relevant to the investigation and prosecution
>of terrorists can be shared with state and local officials,  I hereby
>direct you to designate a Chief Information Officer (CIO) to participate on
>the Anti-Terrorism Task Force (ATTF) in your district.  The CIO shall
>coordinate with the relevant Law Enforcement Coordination Committee (LECC)
>to ensure that the LECC acts as a formal conduit of information with state
>and local officials, including elected officials and local law enforcement
>representatives.  The CIO need not be a new employee and may be your LECC
>coordinator if he or she already has strong ties to state and local
>officials in your district.  Where information is provided by state and
>local officials to federal officials, the CIO should make every effort to
>apprise the state and local individual or agency of any follow-up action
>prompted by the information provided.  I further direct the CIO to assist
>in making state and local officials aware of the various counter-terrorism
>training resources available through the Department of Justice.
>
>         2.  Information Sharing Structures.  To streamline the procedures
>for information sharing between federal, state, and local officials in a
>manner tailored to the needs of each district, I hereby direct the CIO in
>your district to solicit from state and local officials suggestions on the
>best way to disseminate information in your district.  After considering
>those suggestions, the CIO, through the LECC, will establish, by December
>1, 2001, communications protocols for sharing information with state and
>local officials on the ATTF, as well as with chiefs of police and elected
>officials who may not be members of the ATTF in their district.  At a
>minimum the protocol in each district must include a system to communicate
>information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I also urge you to consider
>including in your protocols daily or weekly conference calls with members
>of the LECC, the ATTF, and with chiefs of police and elected officials who
>may not be members of these committees.
>
>         The protocols established pursuant to this directive will not only
>provide a mechanism for federal officials to share information with their
>state and local counterparts, but also must include procedures by which
>state and local officials can forward information to federal officials.
>
>         In fulfilling this directive, I further direct you to use, where
>practicable,  technologies already  available and currently in use by the
>Department to facilitate information-sharing, such as the Regional
>Information Sharing System (RISS).  The RISS system comprises six regional
>intelligence centers operating in various geographic regions, including all
>50 states and the District of Columbia.  The RISS system has created
>riss.net, the only secure internet-based national network for sharing of
>criminal intelligence among federal, state, and local law enforcement
>agencies.  RISS also operates secure WATS/patch and telephone
>communications for one-on-one contact with RISS.  RISS databases can
>provide criminal intelligence information and referral contacts for
>information exchange with other member agencies.
>
>         The Executive Office of United States Attorneys is undertaking a
>review of all law enforcement and intelligence databases in order to
>identify those that should be made available to each of the districts.
>
>         Information must be appropriately analyzed before it can be used
>to its full potential.  The proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2003 already
>requests funding for 93 analysts .   I hereby direct you to ensure that
>these analysts have access to the most recent and reliable information
>available through coordination with the designated CIO and your LECC.  All
>analysts must use the communications structures established pursuant to
>this Directive to facilitate their efforts in investigating and preventing
>terrorist acts.  The analysts will act as a conduit of information from
>federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to local law
>enforcement.  For example, the information gathered through the interviews
>regarding international terrorism would be processed and then disseminated
>by the analyst.
>
>         By working closely with state and local officials to strengthen
>and streamline our procedures for information sharing and analysis, we will
>make great strides towards preventing future terrorist acts and punishing
>those responsible for the September 11 attacks.  I thank you for your
>efforts in this ongoing fight to protect freedom through law and to deliver
>to the American people freedom from fear.

>Coordination
>
>
>         The Department is currently engaged in a multi-front effort both
>to prevent future terrorist attacks and to investigate the horrific acts of
>terror that occurred on September 11.   As we implement new tools for
>fighting terrorism in the recently enacted USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and
>continue our investigation, we must ensure that federal, state, and local
>law enforcement are properly trained to mobilize all available resources
>and deploy all appropriate weapons to win this war.
>
>          The need for training encompasses all issues involved in
>combating terrorism -  from gathering information to formulating the "first
>response"; from identifying valuable intelligence information to sharing
>it; from countering traditional explosives threats to responding to threats
>of biological, chemical, and other weapons of mass destruction.  Although
>our overriding goal is to prevent any further terrorist activity, we also
>must be ready at all levels to respond to any attacks in the safest and
>most efficient fashion.  Training must be made available to all who are on
>the front lines of this war, including police officers, firefighters, and
>other "first responders," as well as prosecutors and elected officials.
>
>         I have previously directed that guidance on the implementation of
>the USA PATRIOT Act, including the sharing of information with the
>intelligence community, be incorporated into the training of all
>Anti-Terrorism Coordinators within the U.S. Attorneys' Offices.  The first
>national training session of Anti-Terrorism Coordinators will occur
>November 13-15, 2001.  This training will supplement the training already
>being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with its Joint
>Terrorism Task Forces.  The materials from the training session occurring
>on November 13-15 and existing FBI counter-terrorism training should be
>made more readily available to these task forces.  Where appropriate, U.S.
>Attorneys' facilities should be made available to their FBI counterparts to
>ensure that such training is more accessible to local law enforcement.
>
>         I hereby direct that, by January 15, 2001, training similar to
>that of the Anti-Terrorism Coordinators be made available to local law
>enforcement participants in the Anti-Terrorism Task Forces either at the
>National Advocacy Training Center in Columbia, South Carolina, or through
>remote training at the 94 United States Attorneys' offices.  Each district
>should determine whether chiefs of police or other local law enforcement
>officers should also receive such training.
>
>         As the President has made clear, the war on terror must be waged
>on all fronts, by all hands, and using every available weapon.  The federal
>government will not fight this reign of terror alone.  Every American must
>help us defend our nation against this common enemy.  Every state, every
>county, and every municipality must join together to form a common defense
>against terrorism.  I thank you for making more effective our national

Bruce Smith and Clarence Major
Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington DC
Monday, November 26, 2001

Born in Philadelphia and raised on a combustible mix of football, jazz,
and American skepticism, Bruce Smith crafts the "broken music" of
late-century masculinity into poems that pop and swing. Smith writes
with a fierce intelligence and an ear for everything from K-Solo to
Catullus. Cited for the "vivid, steady grace" that also characterizes
his other three books of poetry, Silver and Information, The Common
Wages, and Mercy Seat, his most recent volume, The Other Lover, was a
2000 finalist for both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.

For over four decades, Clarence Major has captured the color and buzz of
everyday speech in wildly original works of poetry, fiction, essay,
anthology, and painting. A maestro of the Third Stream, defined in his
Juba to Jive: A Dictionary of African American Slang as "a type of
music...that reflects to a very noticeable degree both the European and
black technical experience," Major transgresses limits of race, genre,
and history with breakneck dexterity. His Configurations: New & Selected
Poems, 1957:30-1997:30, was a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award.

Reading, reception, and book sale, 7:30 p.m.

Hey folks.

Sadly, our esteemed Anti-Laureate is right.  We printed the corrupt
(though not corrupting) text of the Anti-Laureate chapbook, and shipped
hundreds of copies before catching on.  Yikes.  Mea maxima culpa.  Bad
dog.

So: everyone who received a copy of the chapbook with Samizdat #8 will
receive a corrected text wth Samizdat #9.

Shred the old ones!

Recycle them!

Let them re-enter the paper-processing stream and re-emerge as those
Starbucks cup insulators!

The Anti-Laureate wills it, and let His will be done!!!!!

By the way: the first two books from Samizdat Editions are available --
_Vectors: New Poetics_ and _The Possibility of Language: Seven New
Poets_.  Check out ordering info at Samizdateditions.com.

Call for Papers


The Department of English at the University of Calgary invites abstracts for
papers to be presented at the 2002 Graduate Free Exchange Conference:

imPOSTures
March 8-10, 2002
University of Calgary

Post is so ingrained as a prefix in the cultural exchange of information
that it risks being divested of significance by its very pervasiveness. Post
announces the death of totality and yet it has recently emerged victorious
as cultural and intellectual hegemony, engaging several disciplines as a
dominating prefix. So what does post signify? Has it become meaningless? How
does it continue to be useful? And what survives past post?

The title of this conference is intended to suggest a wide range of
postures, non-postures & impostures, as well as critical performances,
related to the idea of post-ism. We welcome both papers that make use of
post-isms and those that criticize them. Interdisciplinary papers are more
than welcome. Possible themes could include, but are not limited to:

.  specific post-isms such as post-modernism, post-colonialism,
post-feminism, post-humanism.
.  trans- and neo- identities and -isms
.  transgressions and border crossings
.  emerging identities
.  postscripts that challenge the authority of grand narratives or that
become newly authoritative narratives in their own right
.  post-ism as an empty signifier
.  the body, cyborgs, technology and simulation / simulacra
.  post as a means of creating art (post-isms, postcards, internet
postings.)
.  post as identity: what does it mean to come after?


Proceedings from the University of Calgary Free Exchange Conference may be
published. Please submit a 250-word abstract by January 8, 2002, to:

Graduate Free Exchange Committee
Department of English
University of Calgary
2500 University Dr. N.W.
Calgary, AB
T2N 1N4

or by e-mail to:  free-_exchange@yahoo.com

The submissions will be vetted blind, so please include your name on the
covering letter only.

Two announcements:

One--Happy Thanksgiving!  The Ear Inn Readings are on holiday Saturday,
November 24.

Two--World AIDS Day.  We'd like to commemorate World AIDS Day on Saturday,
December 1.  If you would like to read 1-3 poems to help us mark this
occasion, please drop me a note.  It would be great if we could get a
variety of perspectives from people who have been touched by the 20 year-old
epidemic in different ways, directly and indirectly.  Not all poems that are
read have to be "AIDS" poems.  The idea of World AIDS Day--which started as
a "Day Without Art" but has always been commemorated as a day of art,
awareness, and remembrance--is to engage in art as an affirmation of
perseverance and survival.  If you think you have something appropriate to
the occasion, you probably do and your voice should be heard.

Thanks.

Michael

The BELLADONNA* Series presents the final Fall reading:

Lynne Tillman, Abigail Child, Cheryl Pallant

Friday, December 7, 8:00 p.m.

PLEASE NOTE CHANGE OF TIME-there will be NO open reading

The reading will take place at Bluestockings; New York's only all women's
bookstore, located at 172 Allen Street, between Rivington and Stanton on the
Lower East Side.  For information and directions, call 212-777-6028.
***
Lynne Tillman is the author of the novels: Haunted Houses, Cast in Doubt,
Motion Sickness and No Lease on Life (National Book Critics Finalist 1998)
and two story collections, The Madame Realism Complex and Absence Makes the
Heart. Her nonfiction includes The Broad Picture, and The Velvet Years:
Warhol's Factory 1965-67. She was a co-editor of Beyond Recognition:
Representation, Power, Culture-Writings of Craig Owens. Her most recent
nonfiction book is Bookstore: The Life and Times of Jeanette Watson and
Books & CO.  Her fiction has been anthologized in, among others, The Norton
Post-Modern Anthology. DAP will soon publish a new collection of her stories
written in relation to artwork by over 25 contemporary artists.

Abigail Child is a writer and film-video maker.  Her films have been shown
extensively in solo and retrospective presentations, at venues such as the
Rotterdam Film Festival, the London Film Festival, ICA London, the Whitney
Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Modern Art NY among others. She
has 5 books of poetry including A Motive for Mayhem (Potes and Poets-1989),
MOB (O Press 1993), and most recently Scatter Matrix (Roof Books 1996).  She
has just completed new manuscript of critical writings about film and poetry
This is Called Moving.  Her newest film DARK DARK premiered at the 2001 New
York Film Festival. Both her film and writing are committed to a rhythmic
exploration the syntax: how words and images and sounds come into meaning,
how disruption of expectations can dislodge the old and renew meaning.

Cheryl Pallant is a multi-genre writer, dancer, and performing artist living
in Richmond, VA.  She teaches in the English and the Dance & Choreography
Department of Virginia  Commonwealth University and until recently, for the
International Program of Ottawa University in Malaysia.  She is also dance
critic for a Richmond newspaper.  Uncommon Grammar Cloth, published by
Station Hill Press, is her first book of poetry.  Her writing appears in
numerous literary and online journals throughout the U.S., in England,
Australia, and the Czech Republic in places like Confrontation, The Crescent
Review, Wormwood Review, and Lyric.
***
        The BELLADONNA*  Reading Series began in August 1999 at the then
newly opened women's bookstore (New York's only) Bluestockings.  In its two
year history, BELLADONNA* has featured such writers as Erica Hunt, Fanny
Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña, Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy and
Nicole Brossard among many other experimental and hybrid women writers.
Beyond being a platform for women writers, the curators promote work that is
experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content.  Alongside the readings, BELLADONNA*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event.  Please contact Rachel Levitsky if you would like to
receive a catalog or hear more about our salons.

Sun & Moon no longer supports a competition for its
New American Poetry series. The only books we now
publish (in that or other series) are books selected in
the National Poetry Series competition. Earlier books in
NAP were selected by the editor on a non-competitive
basis.

"What is attempted here is a life writing or life writing itself, the
biographer letting the documents speak, speaking throught them, impersonating
voices, senses of humor, ironies, sarcasms, hypocrisies. Rather than the urge
to ascertain certain facts, it is carried by the awareness of how our lives'
'events' inevitably come filtered through memory, of how imagination's
decaying sense constantly reinvents what we forget, even seconds after the
fact."--from the Preface.

Call for Submissions, Anomaly Magazine

Anomaly magazine seeks submissions of work other than
poetry, such as reviews, essays, interviews,
dialogues, experimental fiction...interested
contributors should contact the editor via email or
mail work to the snail mail addresses below. The
deadline for the Spring 2002 issue is February 1,
2002. Please direct inquiries to Lorraine Graham at
yakub_etc@yahoo.com, who looks forward to talking with
you and reading your work.

----------------------------------------------------

Anomaly is a print magazine of innovative/experimental
writing with a focus on poetry in the Washington, DC
metropolitan area. The history of innovative poetry in
DC is surprisingly long and varied, and the poetry
unexpected and diverse. There is no "Washington, DC
school of poetry", and no major artistic academic
institution associated with the city. Yet, poets
interested in innovative writing have been coming to
and living in the area since the early 70s.

The goal of Anomaly is to be a means of creating
dialogue, not only between writers in the DC area, but
also between writers in DC and elsewhere. Thus, while
a major focus of Anomaly is innovative poetry in the
Washington, DC metropolitan region, Anomaly actively
seeks contributions from writers throughout the world.


Each issue contains poetry, reviews, and at least one
essay or theoretical object. Anomaly is interested in
collaborations, interdisciplinary work, in any work
that is a deviation from the normal form/order/rule
(personal, academic, political, social, aesthetic…),
and work that is irregular and difficult to classify.

All poetry for the upcoming issue is by solicitation
only (subsequent issues will accept open poetry
submissions, which the editor looks forward to
reading). If you are interested in contributing work
other than poetry, such as a review, an essay, an
interview, a dialogue, experimental fiction...please
contact the editor via email or mail your work to the
snail mail addresses below.

The deadline for the Spring 2002 issue is February 1,
2002.

Please send submissions to:

19 November
2001
Ulla E. Dydo
Stein Textual Scholarship
     Upon the Stein Symposium of 6 October 2001 at New York University
some of us felt uneasy about discussions that addressed Stein’s life and
personality rather than her work. They relied on opinion without factual
information about what I call the context of her texts. As a result, we
tried to raise questions of her art, to offer information and to provoke
controversies to enlighten us.
     It was with this in mind that I spoke about Stein textual
scholarship, not as a report of an academic specialist buried in an
archive but as a matter of importance for any work on Stein texts. Much
of what I discussed is included in my book, The Language That Rises: The
Voice Of Gertrude Stein 1923-1934, forthcoming in 2002 from Norhwestern
University Press. In my talk at the symposium, however, I concentrated
exclusively on textual problems of which younger Stein students, who
take it for granted that reliable Stein texts are widely available, may
not be aware. What I said follows below.
     When I prepared A Stein Reader, between 1986 and 1992, I was not
only thinking about what should be in it, and how. I had a long-term
ulterior motive. I had learned, while working for years on Stein
manuscript texts at the Beinecke Library, that there were innumerable
discrepancies between manuscript, typescript and printed texts of many
works. Obviously these affect how we read the texts, how they sound, how
they look and come to mean. That was why I insisted that all pieces
included in A Stein Reader be checked against original manuscripts,
typescripts, and printed versions. The Reader was a first in showing the
importance of word-for-word reliability in Stein texts.
     My long-term hope was that the Reader might demonstrate the need
for a complete, reliable edition of Stein’s work, with accurate texts
and full notes on dates, variants, revisions, etc. In the seventies and
eighties, there was money for the slow, painstaking detail work required
for a complete edition of an author’s work. There was also an interest
on the part of the National Endowment for the Humanities in supporting
such efforts. An edition of Stein’s Works did not exist. In the
following years, funding became more precarious and even work on some
complete editions of major writers was abandoned. There is still no
Stein Works today, although we know that small mistakes in
transcription, typesetting, and even punctuation, can affect a text.
Without complete, reliable texts, it is difficult to read right, to
trust ones judgment, to interpret an author who does not follow the
rules. Criticism becomes guesswork. Can funding be the only reason for
the delay of a Stein edition?
     Just a few examples of how texts, notes, and critical study are
related: Only after 1970, when the complete, reliable text of Ezra
Pound’s Cantos was issued, could serious study begin. It took another
ten years before, in 1980, the Companion to the Cantos appeared, with
full notes on sources and on Pound’s knowledge of languages and
cultures. As a result of Pound’s war-time activities, his trial and
imprisonment, it was not easy to do this, but writers knew how important
his work was and fought for its publication to preserve its integrity.
     Or think of Joyce’s Ulysses. Printed in book form in Paris in1922,
but banned as indecent in America until 1934, an accurate edition could
not be prepared until the Joyce papers, manuscripts, typescripts,
revisions, page proofs, scattered in many archives and in private hands
in America and Europe, were identified and permission to copy and study
them was secured. When in the mid-eighties the Hans Gabler text of
Ulysses was finally published, it provoked immense and stimulating
controversy about how Joyce wrote, how the book was typed and revised,
about Joyce’s learning, his sense of language, mythology, history. Such
discoveries and disagreements continue to keep writers and scholars
engaged.
     Again, consider what had to be done to restore the poems of Emily
Dickinson, handwritten and sewn together by her in the small book
bundles we call fascicles from what pious family members and editors
interested in selling books had published in sentimentalized,
“corrected” but corrupt and erroneous volumes. In the late fifties
appeared the Johnson edition of her Poems and Letters, beautifully
produced but, as it turned out, still including misreadings and editor’s
mistaken guesses; only in 1981 did R. W. Franklin publish The Manuscript
Books of Emily Dickinson; and consider that Susan Howe spent years in
the eighties and nineties teaching students how to read not what earlier
books had printed but what Dickinson had actually written, when, why and
how.
     Let me here insert a note about annotation. I use Joyce as an
example. An enormous academic industry has grown upon the study of
Joyce’s work, the language which Joyce, with his wide knowledge of
history, mythology, popular culture, music, songs, and so on, endlessly
manipulates. Joyce texts offer a huge field--we might call it a market,
an enterprise worth investing in--for learned exploration, competent
annotation and the use that sanctions the scholar’s learning and tools.
Academic departments thrive on competition and promotion of theory and
specialized scholarly research talent.
     Today, we can find reliable editions of many major authors. They
give us accurate texts and include in notes information about how and
when works were created, how events, letters, biography, language and so
on are important and help explain the writing.
     And yet there is no complete, reliable Stein Works. Here is a
celebrated modernist, a collector, a famous figure in America and
abroad, an expatriate, lesbian, Jew. A public personality, she is better
known as the subject of the many portraits of her by painters,
photographers, memoirists, than as the writer of her own portraits of
them. Yet, with some notable exceptions, Stein’s texts have received
less attention than her personality. And the scholars’ investment in
training, knowledge and tools rarely help them gain access to Stein’s
language. Her vocabulary is simple, her references are rarely learned,
her organization seems irrational, and her ideas often sound more
ordinary than they are.
     If anything, hers are the words of a school primer, of nursery
school or children’s games. To follow her involves reading, rereading,
listening, playing, flashing repetitions before eye and ear--things that
do not demand the scholar’s tools and training of the scholar. She asks
the imagination to take a different path, one that children know but as
adults often forget. The deceptive simplicity of her work, often thought
plain silly, has resisted the usual editorial procedures. She has not
received the scholars’ attention that Joyce, Pound, Eliot, or Dickinson
have. As a result, how she wrote, how she gained access to words, how
those words function--details usually included in annotated textual
editions--have not been studied with care, and her manuscripts have only
begun to be looked at in detail. We gain access not through content and
ideas but only through words, followed not as signifiers but as things
in themselves.
     What are the problems of Stein texts?
     First, accuracy. For texts that constantly play with words and pun,
misprints are a great danger--part of the game. Stein wrote with
meticulous care, and Toklas had orders to type her writing
conscientiously. Still, discrepancies do show up that can be revealing.
Printing was not always accurate, and proofreading, including Stein’s
and Toklas’ own, was often deficient. If you have ever transcribed or
copied a Stein text, you may know how difficult it is--her words do not
follow the expected syntactical paths but spin about eye and ear,
weaving patterns in the mind that may be enjoyable but are not hers.
     Stein revised very little, for she did not believe in revision. Yet
some changes are visible in the manuscripts and must be identified. Most
of these are misspelled or miswritten words that she probably corrected
immediately; but others, especially in later works, appear to be
revisions. Moreover, she in part wrote with a strong visual sense, in
blank, lined, or graph manuscript books, and she relied on features of
the notebooks’ format as well as her own design against those of the
notebooks, to shape her texts. When she started in one notebook and
moved on to a second, third, or more, the move to a new book might enter
her text. Also, notions from illustrations or text on the covers of the
French school cahiers that she used sometimes worked their way into her
writing. In other words, it is sometimes possible to discover how Stein
wrote by looking with care at her manuscripts, lines, margins,
lineation, pen or pencil.
     A small number of tiny private pocket carnets have survived among
Stein’s papers (over the years there must have been many more that are
not preserved); in these she sometimes wrote sections of texts on which
she was working, usually marked, as well as lists of things to buy or
do, places to go, and small love notes to Toklas which Toklas sometimes
answered; later, the texts sections were copied into the manuscript
cahiers by Stein or Toklas. The small notes and lists sometimes add
context to the writing--where she was, what was happening, guests
expected, letters written, the weather.
     Annotating Stein texts requires detailed familiarity with all her
work. And while she wrote one huge book, the great immigrant novel of
The Making Of Americans, most of her other work consists of relatively
short, separate pieces with varied titles that do not describe content
and fail to fit traditional genre designations--poem, essay, story,
play. She rarely follows standard diction, grammar or paragraphing.
(When she first submitted Three Lives for publication--to a vanity
press--an agent appeared at her house to suggest that her language was
full of errors and needed an editor to correct it. She declined.) There
are reasons for how she wrote, and we cannot dismiss her ways as errors
though they go against authority.
     She rarely includes personal detail in writing that steers away
from the temptation to read literary texts biographically; yet Stein has
been admired and displayed as a personality--in her many friendships
with avant-garde painters, writers, composers, editors, and social
personalities throughout the twentieth century in Paris and America. The
“Charmed Circle” of James Mellow’s book is the public circle, not the
writer’s study. She herself helped to create the charmed circle by
writing, late in life, The Autobiography Of Alice B. Toklas, by going on
the American lecture tour of 1934-35, and by the huge publicity it
generated--yet none of this late “public material” explains much about
her composition.
     Stein’s work creates a sequence, and dating her pieces in sequence
is important. Preliminary dates were assigned to the works in the
so-called Yale Catalogue, done in the forties by Robert Haas, a Stein
student and admirer, with help from curators at the Beinecke Library.
But many of these dates turned out to be wrong, or follow an erroneous
order. Only detailed study of manuscripts and typescripts can establish
dates and discover sequences of writing.
     In Stein’s case dates of publication are useless since the history
of her publications is a dismal tale of endless rejections, delays, and
disappointments--not of a series of successful books and reviews. The
Making Of Americans, completed in late 1911, was not published until
1925, and then in a small printing of 500 copies that few could afford.
(Of these, 100 copies were used the next year, 1926, to make the first
American edition.) In 1934, to Stein’s great chagrin, an abridged
edition was published in New York. Libraries did not have the original
edition and readers could not find it. Not until the sixties did it
become possible to buy a complete text in America and England. Much of
her work, especially the early texts, remained unpublished until after
her death. Even when the eight posthumous volumes of Stein work were
issued by Yale University Press, from 1951 to 1958, manuscripts were not
consulted in detail; and pieces were haphazardly chosen, printed, and
arranged. Those volumes did not sell well and the Press saw no quick
profit. As a result, the early volumes were remaindered before the
series was complete; at no point was it possible to buy the whole series
in a bookstore. Remaindering relieved the Press of the obligation to pay
royalties, and Alice Toklas was cut out of sorely needed income.
     Only in recent years have her texts gradually begun to be looked
at, indeed discovered, in manuscript. We can now buy many Stein texts,
recently reprinted, that for years were out of print and unavailable.
But even of these many still do not offer accurate texts and give wrong
dates. When I began to work of Stein, in the seventies, it was
impossible to find her texts. I remember making a deal with someone
upstate who had a copy of Operas And Plays (published by Stein herself
in 1932, never reprinted). In return for a favor, a friend agreed to
photocopy this volume. Nowadays that does not sound like much, but in
those days photocopying was still new and far from perfect. I received
the text, in light grey print, and I worked with and annotated those
pages for years; once xeroxing improved, I made a better copy of the
copy. Only in 1987, when Station Hill Press reprinted the book, did it
become possible to buy it. However, this text, reprinted from the
original plates, included all the original errors. A correct edition of
Operas And Plays has not yet been produced.
     Stein has a cult following. One result is that her work has been
reprinted in its original forms, without careful editorial attention.
Take Portraits And Prayers, her 1934 volume, issued by Bennett Cerf of
the Modern Library to coincide with her American lecture tour. On the
cover is a Carl Van Vechten photograph of Stein, which, displayed in
bookstores, was sure to help sales. In New York people who had seen the
book in shop windows recognized Stein on the street and spoke to her.
There have been several unsuccessful attempts to reissue this volume,
beautifully produced and designed. Yet the pages include serious errors,
which readers still overlook as did the original designer.
     In recent years many Stein texts that for decades were utterly
unavailable have been reprinted. Stein appears to have come into her
own, be accepted by readers, studied by students and admired as a
modernist. In 1933, she published in her own Plain Edition 500 copies of
her early Matisse Picasso And Gertrude Stein with two shorter stories
(including “A Long Gay Book,” “Many Many Women” and “G. M. P.”); it did
not sell well. For years thereafter, you could not find these texts.
Only in 1972 was it reissued and is now available in paperback. Today,
several different publishers have made various reprints of Stein texts
available at reasonable prices. Yet none so far has engaged in a
complete Stein and none have corrected errors.
     For my own work, it was by the accidental discovery of textual
discrepancies--I now sometimes call it pure luck--that I began to
immerse myself in the handwritten work in the cahiers and carnets. And
that is where I began to hear what I call the voice of Gertrude Stein
and to write about it.

Hi,

I have a small favour to ask. I'd be very grateful to anybody who can spend
a little time responding to the following fairly straight forward questions
in respect of some research I'm conducting on discourse networks for
contemporary poetry/poetics. Please don't feel you have to answer all of the
questions. Any response will help me to begin at least a sketch towards
current attitudes and practice. PLEASE don't send responses to the list, but
back channel them to me : cris@slang.demon.co.uk

______________

What was the stimulus for you in joining your first e-list serv?

When was that?

Was your first e-list serv one dealing in contemporary poetry/poetics? If
not then what was its nominal subject?

How many lists are you on and which of them nominally engage with
contemporary poetry/poetics?

What have been the most interesting aspects of list participation for you?
Do you have any favourite 'moments' / exchanges / . .?

What has frustrated you most as a continuing participant?

Would you consider yourself:

- a practitioner

- one who is an enthusiastic 'reader'

- one who is interested in theorising/critiquing contemporary practice

- one who would use the word 'praxis' in respect of what you do

- or how would you describe your interest . . .

Do you have any thoughts at all on the following in respect of your practice
and experience of e-list servs:

- 'dominant' voices

- the e-list as a gendered space,

- writing technologies (technological inequalities and the impact of
emergent writing technologies on poetic practices and circulation of poetic
practice)

- local / translocal conversations / globalism

How do you feel about the archiving of such ongoing discussions, both the
importance of them and the ownership of them? Do you ever visit and or use
existing archives?

I sincerely hope you can see ways to respond to these question, it'd be
helpful and the help will be acknowledged.

it's for PhD research I'm working on and is not related to my own
participation on or co-ownership of any lists. All information will be
treated as confidential.

thanks in advance

Hi,

I am a contributor to 100 days and seem to remember that the price for
contributors was $8.95.  Is that price still in effect?  Please advise.

Thanks.

Ms. Dydo -- Thank you so much for this information, for your work.  Recently
looked at an apt in an old Oakland mansion in Stein's childhood
neighborhood, with a semblance of the thrill it must be to see her carnets &
cahiers!
Happy Thanksgiving.

>not be prepared until the Joyce papers, manuscripts, typescripts,
>revisions, page proofs, scattered in many archives and in private hands

>French school cahiers that she used sometimes worked their way into her
>writing. In other words, it is sometimes possible to discover how Stein
>wrote by looking with care at her manuscripts, lines, margins,
>lineation, pen or pencil.
>      A small number of tiny private pocket carnets have survived among
>Stein’s papers (over the years there must have been many more that are
>not preserved); in these she sometimes wrote sections of texts on which
>she was working, usually marked, as well as lists of things to buy or
>do, places to go, and small love notes to Toklas which Toklas sometimes
>answered; later, the texts sections were copied into the manuscript
>cahiers by Stein or Toklas. The small notes and lists sometimes add
>context to the writing--where she was, what was happening, guests
>expected, letters written, the weather.
>      Annotating Stein texts requires detailed familiarity with all her
>work. And while she wrote one huge book, the great immigrant novel of
>The Making Of Americans, most of her other work consists of relatively
>short, separate pieces with varied titles that do not describe content
>and fail to fit traditional genre designations--poem, essay, story,
>play. She rarely follows standard diction, grammar or paragraphing.
>(When she first submitted Three Lives for publication--to a vanity
>press--an agent appeared at her house to suggest that her language was
>full of errors and needed an editor to correct it. She declined.) There
>are reasons for how she wrote, and we cannot dismiss her ways as errors
>though they go against authority.
>      She rarely includes personal detail in writing that steers away
>from the temptation to read literary texts biographically; yet Stein has
>been admired and displayed as a personality--in her many friendships
>with avant-garde painters, writers, composers, editors, and social
>personalities throughout the twentieth century in Paris and America. The
>“Charmed Circle” of James Mellow’s book is the public circle, not the
>writer’s study. She herself helped to create the charmed circle by
>writing, late in life, The Autobiography Of Alice B. Toklas, by going on
>the American lecture tour of 1934-35, and by the huge publicity it
>generated--yet none of this late “public material” explains much about
>her composition.
>      Stein’s work creates a sequence, and dating her pieces in sequence
>is important. Preliminary dates were assigned to the works in the
>so-called Yale Catalogue, done in the forties by Robert Haas, a Stein
>student and admirer, with help from curators at the Beinecke Library.
>But many of these dates turned out to be wrong, or follow an erroneous

>      In Stein’s case dates of publication are useless since the history

>disappointments--not of a series of successful books and reviews. The

In December on the award-winning, public radio series, The Infinite =
Mind:=20

Art and Madness=20
FEED DATES: December 5 and 6=20
Images of the tormented artist, poet, painter and composer are familiar. =
but is there a verifiable link between madness and art? In this popular =
encore presentation, we'll hear from actress Margot Kidder, who has =
manic depression; Linda Gray Sexton, writer and daughter of Pulitzer =
Prize-winning poet Anne Sexton; and top researchers. With a performance =
(and analysis!) of music written by German composer Robert Schumann, and =
commentary by John Hockenberry.=20

Migraine
FEED DATES: December 12 and 13
The "take two aspirin and call me in the morning" approach to headache =
just doesn't work for people with migraine, a debilitating neurological =
condition that affects an estimated 30 million Americans. This encore =
presentation looks at genetics, treatment and advocacy, and includes a =
challenging discussion with neurologist, author and migraine sufferer =
Dr. Oliver Sacks. With commentary by John Hockenberry.

Weather and the Mind
FEED DATES: December 19 and 20
Are blue skies smiling above you? Or are you under the weather? Do you =
know which way the wind is blowing? We often talk about how we feel in =
terms of the weather, but how much does what's happening outside affect =
what is going on inside the human mind? This encore program includes an =
interview with Dr. Norman Rosenthal, who discovered Seasonal Affective =
Disorder, and a reading from award-winning author Jan de Blieu. Plus, =
Jungian analysis of our fascination with extreme weather, and we ride =
along with a tornado-chaser. Commentary by John Hockenberry.=20

Shyness=20
FEED DATES: December 26 and 27
Many people balk at the thought of public speaking. For some, any =
situation that calls for human contact can seem not just frightening but =
potentially devastating. This encore presentation explores the =
psychological and biological origins as well as the experience of =
shyness - from sweaty palms to full-blown social phobia. With commentary =
by John Hockenberry and a special performance by Suzanne Vega.

The Infinite Mind is the weekly, public radio series on the art and =
science of the human mind. It is hosted by Dr. Fred Goodwin and produced =
by the Peabody Award-winning Lichtenstein Creative Media. It is free for =
unlimited airplay to all public radio stations. The Infinite Mind =
currently airs on more than 170 public radio stations, and is produced =
in association with WNYC/NY.=20

Infinite Mind visit http://www.theinfinitemind.com/stations.htm. For =
more information, visit www.theinfinitemind.com or contact The Infinite =
Mind's Station Outreach Coordinator, Laura Newmark, at Lichtenstein =

A recent publication of mine may be of interest:

A hypertext "essay" that attempts to work against received standards for
document presentation along with linguistic standardization, it appears
under the title Daev. Gl=vulaa, "Hii-=perlexicoaorpara=][strophism..." in
_Postmodern Culture_ 12:1 (September 2001). To some extent, this reflects on
an earlier essay of mine titled "Hypercapital" that appeared in the same
journal about 5 years ago.

Most colleges, libraries and universities get this journal via Project Muse.
Members of subscribing institutions can access this via their library's web
gateway to Project Muse journals or via http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pmc.

There is also a stand-alone version of the "essay" that I maintain for those
outside of subscribing institutions:

City Lights has just published the first in a series of books related to the
Situationist International.

gave birth to the Letterist International. Great stories, with priceless
photographs and documentation.

The Tribe is shipping now and should be available in any good bookstore. You
can also order it directly from City Lights Bookstore. See
http://www.citylights.com for details.

Thanks, --James Brook

THE TRIBE
By Jean-Michel Mension

Conversations with Gerard Berreby and Francesco Milo
Translated from the French by Donald Nicholson-Smith

Contributions to the History of the Situationist International and Its
Times, Vol I

Between 1952 and 1954, Jean-Michel Mension haunted Saint-Germain-des-Pres as
a member of the legendary Letterist International, direct progenitor of the
Situationist International. In a series of conversations, Mension recounts
this very particular vie de boheme whiled away with Guy Debord and a rogue's
gallery of hard drinkers and thinkers.

The Tribe is a rare, vivid tour of a moment and milieu barely noticed at the
time by the tourists who flocked to the Left Bank for a glimpse of Sartre &
Co. The rich iconography includes many of Ed van der Elsken's celebrated
photographs of "the tribe" and a trove of Letterist leaflets and posters.

"The Tribe relates the Parisian wanderings of a heterogeneous group of
individuals who cultivated laziness and revolt, alcohol and talk, drift and
chance, creative hopes and encounters ... in quest of a Rimbaldian
derangement of all the senses, of detournement of art and daily life by the
defiance of order, by vandalism, by delinquency, but also by an altogether
contemporary quest for a supersession of Marxism." --Le Monde libertaire

Jean-Michel Mension (b. 1934) misspent his youth in Saint-Germain-des-Pres
in the early 1950s before joining the Communist Party in 1962 and the Ligue
Communiste in 1968. The Tribe is Mension's first book; he recently published
his second, Le Temps gage.

and develop your particular way of expression and break through the
fears associated with creation.

1...Creativity Workshop: General Information

This internationally renowned intensive workshop brings together people
of all backgrounds, cultures, and interests to discover new and
exciting tools for generating creativity and thinking and working in
new and exciting ways by using creative writing, visual arts, and
brainstorming techniques.

Process not Product
The Creativity Workshop is for anyone interested in expanding their
creative potential. The workshop is attended by educators, artists,
business executives, writers, lawyers, doctors, homemakers, advertising
and design people--all with the common goal of experimenting with their
imaginations and finding new ways to stimulate and expand their
creative potential. Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have developed a
series of exercises designed to help participants develop and recognize
their individual creative processes. Participants explore different
artistic materials and mediums in order to discover their own unique
ways of expression and to learn to break through the fears and
distractions that inhibit creativity.

Tools for a Lifetime
The exercises used in the Creativity Workshop are intended to become
the tools for a lifetime of creative expression. Participants are
encouraged to draw from all kinds of resources of creativity -such as
the oral tradition, dreams, childhood memories, sense perceptions and
intuition. Working both individually and in collaborative groups,
participants explore their imaginative potential through exercises in
writing, drawing, collage, map making, story telling and guided
visualization.

4...What people say about the Creativity Workshop

"The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn
their dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how
you can do this through their challenging and inspiring creativity
workshops...even a simple first contact will prove what these two
talented teachers can do for your own gifts." Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer,
Professor, Singapore Management University.

"The Creativity Workshop in Spoleto has been a very special experience
for me. It opened up new ways to look at my work and I found new
friendships. I spent 15 fantastic days in an incredible place. Shelley
and Alejandro are superb teachers!" Vera Eisenberg, painter, Argentina

"The Workshop was such a powerful experience for me, something I never
expected nor would I ever be able to repeat it." Rolfe Werner,
Engineer. Canberra, Australia.

"I found the workshop extremely valuable in generating awareness of my
creativity and in stimulating ideas." Jeanne Arthur, Executive Officer,
ACT Board of Secondary School Studies. Canberra, Australia.

"I feel as though I now have a focus, a method, a way of evolving my
ideas and that the means are just as important as the end. I have
created environments just to create in, and environments just to
display the work in. My vision of attending to each detail, sound,
smell, texture, substance... is starting to find a home. Thanks for
opening my eyes to these essential aspects of creating through your
guidance and example." Student. University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

"This class was THE MOST enriching, enlightening, inspirational class I
have ever taken. The way I work and what I create will never be the
same." Student. University of Iowa, USA.

"Shelley and Alejandro's Creativity Workshop is amazing in that it
breaks down all your fears about thinking and writing. If it wasn't for
them I fear I never would have finished my master's thesis. I was
blocked until I took this course." Francesca Salidu PHD candidate in
Shakespeare, University of Pisa. San Miniato, Italy.

"Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel taught their Creativity Workshop as
American Cultural Specialists under the United States Information
Service auspices. To say that they were extremely effective is a vast
understatement. I would unreservedly recommend their course. They have
abundant creativity, energy, and a wealth of skills." Gloria Berbena,
Asst. Cultural AttachŽ, US Information Service, US Embassy. Rome,
Italy.

"A special experience. Berc and Fogel opened us up to new and wonderful
ways of looking at our creativity." Belkis Bottfeld, PHD, psychologist.
Istanbul, Turkey.

"An unforgettable course!" Gulnur Ayaz, MD. Istanbul, Turkey.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

5...The teachers

Shelley Berc is a writer and teacher. She is a professor of the
International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. Her novels,
plays, and essays which include 'The Shape of Wilderness', 'A Girl's
Guide to the Divine Comedy' and 'Theatre of the Mind' have been
published by Coffee House Press, Johns Hopkins Press, Heinemann Books,
Performing Arts Journal and Theatre Communications Group Press. Her
plays have been produced by theatres such as the American Repertory
Theatre, the Yale Rep, and the Edinburgh Festival.

Alejandro Fogel is a visual artist and teacher working in painting,
site installations, video and digital art. He has exhibited his works
in galleries and museums in Argentina, Bulgaria, Cuba, France, Hungary,
Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United States and Germany. His
ongoing project 'Root to Route' chronicles his father's journey through
the Holocaust years. His work is in private collections and museums
around the world.

Berc and Fogel explain in theory and demonstrate in practice the
concepts of originality, 'appropriation', memory and imagination. Under
their guidance, participants explore their own creative processes
through different writing and drawing exercises. They emphasize the
intimate link between personal and public spheres, individual and
social practices, history and myth, dream and reality. The focus of the
workshop is on process not product and to help participants find
life-long tools of creative expression. Shelley Berc and Alejandro
Fogel have taught their Creativity Workshop internationally. They have
lectured on creativity and their own work at universities and cultural
centers throughout the world. They currently teach the Creativity
Workshop as an intensive semester long course at the International
Writing Program of The University of Iowa.

I'm happy to say my first collection - Duty - is now available in the US and
the UK. It's published by Paper Bark Press, along with Devin Johnston's
Telepathy and Martin Harrison's Summer.
Blurbs follow, then contact details for those who would like to buy a copy.

Geraldine

Duty -

Hear ye! Hear ye! Geraldine McKenzie is entering the hall of language
mirrors. Listen for the inflections of the reflections. Duty calls. And then
some.
                   Charles Bernstein

A rare bird indeed! Geraldine McKenzie is a new voice in Australian poetry.
She writes with passion and intelligence, coalescing space and time.
                  Dorothy Hewett

Telepathy -

Telepathy is a book about possibility, and Devin Johnston enters this realm
with great skill, navigating time and space. He is a poet who has learnt
from elders like Duncan and Creeley how to exploit what Olson called the
""Post Modern" and bring to light half-forgotten origins. How apt that this
powerful first book was written in the US and published in Australia.
Telepathy is brilliantly written and delightfully readable.
                   Robert Adamson

While his lexicon is rich and particular, Johston's line is severe,
unadorned, and keenly cut to measure out the subtle, counterpointed music
which so marks these poems. If he asserts that 'Souls never touch/ their
objects', Johnston's vision is nevertheless essentially phenomenological.
Despite the fact that they span nearly a decade of his writing life,  the
poems of Telepathy cohere around Johnston's intensely focused exploration of
a subject that is inextricably bound up in a physical world and mediated by
language. His words are equally "landmarks". Reading this remarkable book,
we take a journey that alters our perception and so remaps our lives.
                 Forrest Gander

I read these poems as lovely, strange, and mystico-historical...
                 Fanny Howe

Summer -

Harrison is concerned with the 'magic' of poetic sight and sound; with our
everyday perception being stretched almost to the point of non-perception.
                  David McCooey, Australian Book Review

Harrison re-creates 'livable' locales in his poems, utterly convincing
places where ordinary happiness might reside.
                  Nigel Wheale, London Review of Books

   I was Shanghaied out to the last day of the Joe Brainard Retro at P.S. 1...L.I.C. I once bought for a couple of bucks and still have a large cut paper floating collage of his and wanted to see what the market would bear.

   The third floor rooms were full of Brainard sellable framed stuffe...in all sizes shapes periods and styles. Flower, collage,d.j., cartoon, pencil, ossorio. If the purpose of art is to produce sellable product, then the purpose of art was served.

    I didn't much look at the framed stuffe..but the labels and ownership tags tell a different story. Big stock holders in Joe Brainard Inc are Kenward Elmslie, Ron Padgett and Wife and Jo Leseur. We're all hoping for a bull market. Bet on light, hedge on darkness.

    We went  to Astoria after and had moussaka. Good 'nuff....DRn...

Hi, all--

For a project I'm working on, I would appreciate some
feedback.  Basically, if I were to ask you think of a
list of the most important young (under 45) American
women poets, who would you name?  These should all be
women with at least one book out, winners of awards,
etc.  I am looking for all kinds of poets, not just
experimentalists -- poets of every style.  And I am
especially interested in getting names of regional
writers, writers of color, queer writers, etc.
(Please note that I am not trying to judge quality or
make a "best of" list -- I am just trying to get a
sense of who people are reading out there and who I
might have missed for this project.)

Top of mind is great -- just whatever comes to you
immediately.  Please backchannel to
ariellecg@yahoo.com.

Thanks so much,
Arielle

     4 pm: Panel Discussion
     8 pm: Reading

Slight changes to this event announced below

     The opener of our new Series X, investigating the enactment of
radicality and tradition in varying situations and for varying purposes.
Open Borders,  Series X: On Translation will include an afternoon panel
moderated by Michael Palmer with translators Pierre Joris, Jen Hofer,
Walter Lew, and Diane Weipert, as well as an evening reading of poetry
they've translated from North Africa, Korea, Mexico and Cuba, introduced

     Sunday, December 2, 2001 at 2 p.m.
     Crosstown Traffic -- Tanya Hollis & Amanda Hughen

     Visual artists Tanya Hollis and Amanda Hughen will present and
discuss their work and processes. Tanya Hollis attended New College of the
University of South Florida, receiving a BA in Religion with a thesis on
women's roles in slave religion in the South, and then SUNY-Buffalo for
her Masters in Library Science. She now resides in San Francisco, and is
currently the Acting Director at the California Historical Society's North
Baker Research Library. Hollis will be talking about her job as an
archivist and its implications in her work as a visual artist; she is also
a sculptor, using  mainly found objects, and is involved in the Bay Area
poetry scene. Amanda Hughen is a visual artist who looks at utilitarian
forms in the built environment, and explores the nuance that emerges from
the repetition of forms within a system. Hughen has shown throughout the
Bay Area, at such venues as the San Francisco Art Commission Gallery, The
Luggage Store, a.o.v., Refusalon, the San Francisco Art Institute, and
Southern Exposure.
 She has been an artist in residence at the DeYoung Museum Artists Studio,
and an affiliate artist at the Headlands Center for the Arts. Hosted by
Yedda Morrison.

Subject:      Soliloquy by Kennth Goldsmith from Granary Books
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1" ; format="flowed"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

Granary Books is pleased to announce the publication of Kenneth
Goldsmith's "Soliloquy" in an affordable trade paperback format. In
the tradition of Andy Warhol's "A" and David Antin's talk poems,
Goldsmith ups the ante on real speech as poetry. An unedited document
of every word Goldsmith spoke during a week in 1996, "Soliloquy"
quantifies and concretizes the sheer amount of language that
surrounds us in our daily lives. By turns intimate, profound, and
mundane, an autobiography of one man emerges, defined by the language
he produces as he goes about his business over the course of the
week: his relationships, his career, his love life - speech clings to
every contour.

ISBN 1-887123-53-9 - -489 pp. --  $17.95 - -

"Confronted with the matter of 'real' speech (not to mention its
content, which might prove more embarrassing than its stammers and
mumbles), we realize that we all sound a bit like George Bush..."
Gordon Tapper, zingmagazine



To help afford a peek into what exactly is spoken of in this book we
offer below the full index to the first edition (Editions Bravin Post
Lee, 1997).

Jim Cory's published six chapbooks of poems, most recently "the redheads,"
1997 by Insight to Riot Press. He's working on a book-length poem about
about American architecture. He likes cats and stays in a lot and can be
reached at coryjim@earthlink.net




37 x 1 x 2


A dullard in person is almost always a dullard in print.

     *

Envy was the base on top of which the rest of her psychological make-up had
been carefully applied.


     *

I'm on a diet. Allegedly.

     *

On yoga: I'd much rather eat a pretzel than be one.

     *

Whenever people are provided with an opportunity to demonstrate their moral
superiority, it's best to get quickly out of the way, because there's going
to be a stampede.

     *

You know what you know when you know it & that's all you know.

     *

It's better to be an honest nobody than a well-known charlatan.

     *



2.


The critic in his blurb calls the jejune writings of a particular novice
"scatological," unintentionally accurate in overlooking the fact that the
word is a 5 syllable synonym for shitty.

     *

The greatest compliment a person can give is his undivided attention.

     *

Fame is essentially an exalted form of vanity.

     *

Just because you find the work of certain artists enthralling doesn't mean
they're pleasant people.

     *

People will believe anything horrible about someone they envy.

     *

Jack was the kind of guy who turned every resentment into a lifetime
achievement award.

     *

Dogs have long since ceased to serve any useful purpose in Western society,
except to amuse children and console the inconsolable.

     *

Shelly had a past. And her past had a past.

     *

His face had long since left his hairdo in the dust.

3.


     *

Beware ingratiating people & the gift that keeps on taking.


     *

Ever notice that time has a whole different value when you don't have any?

     *

Mice are a lot like us. It basically comes down to eating and fucking.

     *

He was my rock and the pebble beneath my mattress.

     *

Philadelphia is a lot like a village, except that there's more than one
idiot.

     *

I'm not that interested in Surrealism. I had my fill of it growing up.

     *

He'd shot himself so many times his foot looked like a collander.

     *

The scariest thing about Oklahoma is how much it resembles the mind on those
days when we just don't want to be bothered.

     *



4.


Lou didn't so much drop names as shed them.

     *

The problem with being a bigshot is that you never notice the little things.

     *

He was a tidal wave of need looking for a human continent to crash into.

     *

Lisa was green with penis envy.

     *

Thrifty to the last and presciently anticipating a dearth of visitors, my
father ordered an inconspicuous plot & a tombstone not much bigger than a
thumbnail.

     *

Bill always looks as though he'd just stepped out of a different decade.

     *

Time is the only real editor.

     *

Philadelphia: the city that never sweeps.

     *


5.



What's the point of having anything if you don't know how to share it with
other people?

     *

Diane threw the ideological baby out with the party line bathwater.

     *

He went from the toast of the town to burnt toast in 6 months.

     *

That leather jacket Steve swiped from someone at the bar eventually wore him.

     *

If his life was an open book, mine was an unread newspaper.

     *

As I near the half-century mark, I only hope I'm not around when people go to
the supermarket for bottled air.

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An afternoon reading with
PIERRE JORIS

Thursday November 29
4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

** Note:  on Saturday December 1, Pierre Joris will be part of Series X: On
Translation, including an afternoon panel at 4 :00 pm moderated by Norma
Cole with translators Pierre Joris, Jen Hofer, Walter Lew, and Diane
Weipert, and an evening reading at 8:00 pm of poetry in translation from
North Africa, Korea, Mexico and Cuba.  Sponsored by Small Press Traffic, at
Timken Lecture Hall, California College of Arts and Crafts, 1111 Eighth
Street, San Francisco. **

As poet Nicole Brossard notes, "To read the poetry of PIERRE JORIS is to
listen to the ticking of the words, to observe them preparing to move and
alter themselves so as to expose the nature of what a split second of
fervor in language can do to meaning."  Mr. Joris's first major publication
of his own poetry in the United States is Poasis: Selected Poems 1986-1999
(Wesleyan University Press, 2001).  "This is a substantial volume both for
what it proposes and for the pleasure in fragmentary form it brings
forward.  It is an intimate book of data, personal confidence, theoretical
pursuit and perceptive vision. . . .  [Joris's poems] extend with urgency
and reflection a personal encounter with the complex and diverse faces of
modernism.  These poems work at times with delightful sonic care, melodic
staccato stanzas stacked with provocative imagery."  (Dale Smith, in Skanky
Possum, http://www.skankypossum.com)

This large new book follows on numerous acclaimed anthologies and over a
dozen translations, in several directions, into and from French, German,
and English.  With Jerome Rothenberg he coedited the massive two-volume
international anthology Poems for the Millennium (1995 & 1998), and the
collection pppppp: The Selected Writing of Kurt Schwitters (1993).  Besides
numerous contributions within those volumes, he is noted for his remarkably
nuanced translations of Paul Celan, Maurice Blanchot, and Edmond Jab=E8s,
among others.  Mr. Joris lives in Albany, New York.

PRESS RELEASE:

qui parle: literature, philosophy, visual arts, history

is pleased to announce the publication of

Volume 12, Issue 2:

A Special Issue on the Poetics of New Meaning
Guest-Edited by Barrett Watten

The essays presented in this issue are researches into the poetics of the
new, investigations of the literary and cultural status of new meaning.
Written by innovative poets and critics who have weighed the present
horizon of their work with the claims to innovation of earlier historical
periods, each asks: Is innovation still a primary goal, or is the new at
this late date a nightmare of precedence, a mere renewal of earlier
possibility, or a cataclysmic break? How do we recognize a paradigm shift,
and if one is granted, what are its implications for our position in
relation to it? is new meaning always outside us, or is it only "us"?

Contents:

Introduction:

Barrett Watten

Twice a year qui parle publishes provocative interdisciplinary articles
covering a range of innovative theoretical and critical work in the
humanities.  Past issues have featured authors such as Giorgio Agamben,
Judith Butler, Anne Cheng, Jacques Derrida, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe,
Avital Ronell, Kaja Silverman, Gianni Vattimo, and Slavoj Zizek.  Founded

In the midst of a NY Times story about the effect of the National
Book Awards on sales, now that UPC scanners are used in more retail
settings, sales figures for Alan Dugan's Poems Seven:

week ending Oct 28  - 60 copies sold
week ending Nov 4  - 10 copies sold
week ending Nov 11  -  20 copies sold
week ending Nov 18  - 250 copies sold

Monthly sales of 340 copies of a poetry book (which I assume is not
yet being used in classes, though that 60 copy week may show
otherwise) seems pretty good, but note, the winner in the children's
book category sold roughly half again as many copies in the same
period (470), the non-fiction winner sold about 14-15 times as many
(4,900), and in any ONE of these four weeks, the fiction winner sold
about a hundred times as many copies as the Dugan book did in the
four weeks total.

The chart in the print edition of the paper is, unfortunately,
apparently not online:

The electronic book review covers literature's becoming electronic. Over six
years of continuous publication at the Alt-X network, its interface has come
to incorporate image, code, and now sound. The current issue, "music sound
noise," features a number of cybernetically active essays. One by Trace
Reddell transforms the dj groove box into a machine for literary
speculation. Jeff Parker proposes a poetics of the hypertext link and
invites readers to submit examples of their own favorite link types. Sound
artist Elise Kermani limns the differences between noise, music, and sound,
and readers are invited to compare results in a database-driven survey.
Together, MSN's feature essays advance the ongoing debates on 'cybertext' -
not only by producing more theory, but by integrating cybernetic
possibilities into the form of the critical essay itself.

EKPHRASIS: EXPLORING POETRY/ART COLLABORATIONS

Featuring: Max Gimblett, Archie Rand, Eileen Tabios and John Yau

When: 6:30 p.m., Thursday, December 13, 2001
Where:  Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10021
Admission: $5
Sponsors: Asia Society and Asian American Writers Workshop

Through visual presentations, poetry readings, panel discussions and audienc=
e=20
question-and-answer opportunities, the two poets and two artists shall=20
explore poetry-artist collaborations.  This promises to be a unique event. =20
Befitting how the four participants transcend categories in their work, they=
=20
have generated a unique approach to collaborations. Max Gimblett's=20
collaborations with Eileen Tabios and John Yau occur in a psychic space that=
=20
obviates the constraints of physical place and time.  Archie Rand's and John=
=20
Yau's collaborations are marked by a spontaneous, often combustive, manner=20
that precludes the safety net of editing -- as exemplified in their=20
etchings-based collaboration, 100 MORE JOKES FROM THE BOOK OF THE DEAD=20
(Meritage Press), which will be launched at this event.  A new broadside=20
featuring an alchemical collaboration between Max Gimblett and Eileen Tabios=
,=20
FROM THE TIBETAN HALLWAY OF TRANSITION (Second Avenue Press), also will be=20
available.


BIOS:
MAX GIMBLETT's work is comprised largely of object based paintings, drawings=
=20
and sculpture in a variety of shapes: the oval, square, circle, and=20
quatrefoil. The surfaces combine the use of materials, polymers and resins=20
with precious metals such as gold, silver, moon gold, copper and bronze. =20
Gimblett's intention in these works is to explore the multiplicity of meanin=
g=20
attached to such revered materials and shapes. His philosophical position=20
embraces an Eastern and Western spiritual position in associating precious=20
metals with honour, wisdom, light and enlightenment.  An ongoing series of=20
more gestural paintings show Gimblett's interest in Eastern calligraphy with=
=20
the physicality of American Abstract Expressionism.  Shown in America,=20
Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Japan, Switzerland and Denmark, Gimblett=E2=
=80=98s=20
work is represented in over sixty museums, libraries and corporate=20

Council of New Zealand, as well as a former J. Paul Getty Associate at The=20
Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities and artist in=20
residence at the Rockefeller Foundation, Bellagio, Italy, he has collaborate=
d=20
with such poets as Robert Creeley, John Yau, Lewis Hyde, Eileen Tabios, Alan=

Loney and Stuart Horodner.  A major book on his artistic career, to be=20
published by Craig Potton Publishing, will be released in 2002; written by=20
Wystan Curnow and John Yau, the monograph will explore Gimblett's work from=20
the seventies to the present.  More information about the artist is availabl=
e=20
at his website WWW.MAXGIMBLETT.COM.

ARCHIE RAND began exhibiting at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in 1966 while he=20
was still a teenager. A painter, muralist, illustrator, and designer, he has=
=20
had more than eighty solo museum and gallery exhibitions, and participated i=
n=20
over two hundred group exhibitions worldwide. His work is represented in ove=
r=20
one hundred international and corporate collections, including the Art=20

Israel Museum; Jewish Museum, New York; Museum of Modern Art, New York; New=20

Collection.  In 1999, he received a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship and was=
=20
made a Laureate of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture, which also=20
awarded him a Medal of Achievement for Contributions in the Visual Arts. His=
=20
honors and grants include a National Endowment for the Arts Grant in=20

with John Yau on a wide range of projects, Rand has completed collaborations=
=20
with Clark Coolidge and with Robert Creeley.  A distinguished teacher, he is=
=20
currently Professor of Visual Arts at Columbia University.

EILEEN TABIOS has written, edited or co-edited eight books of poetry, fictio=
n=20
and essays as well as released a poetry CD since 1996 when she traded in a=20
banking career for poetry.  Most of her creative writing are inspired by the=
=20
visual arts.  In 2001, she began to explore ways to create poems with=20
physical bodies and multidimensional spaces. The results include sculptures,=
=20
drawings, installations, a performance wedding ceremony and collaborations=20
with other poets, visual artists and musicians which will be exhibited in=20

For some strange reason I can't seem to find your email address in the post.

I am embarrassed to say that there are mostly men on my poetry shelves.  I
didn't even realize how few women poets I had books of until I just looked.

The under 45 requirement makes it a little hard to come up with a good list.
I think maybe Susan Howe, Lyn Hejinian, Jena Osman, Thalia Field, Rosemarie
Waldrop, CD Wright, Liz Waldner, Leslie Scalapino, Anne Waldman, Alison
Deming, Barbara Hamby...in no particular order. These are mostly
experimentally-leaning poets, not because experimentalists are better but
because they are younger, and I am into that sort of thing these days.  I
read a lot of Marilyn Hacker (and she's a queer writer) at one point, but I
think she's too old. I hope I haven't left out people who are really good
and are on the Poetics list; it's a little embarrassing to make such a list
publicly...  But I would be glad to see other people's choices because it
might get me reading someone I haven't already heard of.

What's the project?

Millie

Hi, all--

For a project I'm working on, I would appreciate some
feedback.  Basically, if I were to ask you think of a
list of the most important young (under 45) American
women poets, who would you name?  These should all be
women with at least one book out, winners of awards,
etc.  I am looking for all kinds of poets, not just
experimentalists -- poets of every style.  And I am
especially interested in getting names of regional
writers, writers of color, queer writers, etc.
(Please note that I am not trying to judge quality or
make a "best of" list -- I am just trying to get a
sense of who people are reading out there and who I
might have missed for this project.)

Top of mind is great -- just whatever comes to you
immediately.  Please backchannel to
ariellecg@yahoo.com.

Thanks so much,
Arielle

(essay on sex.mywork for an offline magazine.)



k14% sex.mywork


k16% sex
ksh: sex: not found

k17% i'm not saying that sex is a foundation, originary impulse; only that
it retro-projects into the fantasm of an originary state. sex is neither
an irruption or disturbance within enlightenment contractuality - nor is
it intimate with violence, with pleasure, with desire.

in spite of aphanisis, its domain engorges, its symbols topple, it topples
symbols. it pervades appearance as perception peels layer after layer of
clothing, culture, speech, away from bodies turning supine.

it curls around the image. it filters through programs and protocols. our
names are lost; we are always among the missing. the greater our passions,
our arousals, the less our signifiers remain; we flow like wax into you,
taking your impressions.

it's politics. it transforms into the rhetoric of war and the strategy of
war. it's a game of substitutions. this is a window of displacements.

content curls around the image in a state of arousal. it creates uneasy
dreams. it may be portrayed as the game of bodies: give yours, take ours.
it's the beginning of transitivity: we will devour you, you will devour
us. and the beginning of an inverse economy in which value is devalued in
breathlessness.

sex uncurls the body; eventually everything is proffered, di/s/played,
exposed. you are given the ontology of the image, representation portrayed
and analyzed as function. the sexual image is oral, pre-oedipal, the
murmur of the world, the choratic stuttering into the construct of space
and time.

eventually it doesn't need anything at all, neither body nor viewer,
writer nor reader. plasma curls the image, the page, the computer, flesh
and its offerings. neither is it transcendent; it remains caught in the
throat; the throat surrounds it; the throat is distended; nothing
breathes, nothing speaks.

k3% work
ksh: work: not found

k4% everything turns to liquid; everything flows, cauterizes. the corro-
sive effect on the basin is to gnaw through to emptiness. within the aegis
of gravity, gravitas, it can flood through all pronouncement. it draws you
in. sex curls the screen, turns hard drives into replete translations,
fills hard drives with catalysts of the imaginary, turns our images into
part-objects, spreads us across your magnetic domains, your optical
domains, your fiber optics, your twisted copper wires. nothing touches
anything; the drives are sealed, abjection without.

"what we have is our presence in the cosmos; we can feel the weight of our
arms, legs, breasts, the heaviness of our head turned to one side or
another, the explosive gasp of air (surfacing), the violent inhalation
(going down once again). we are thrown into the flesh of other's; we claw
through it back to our original face." (banon)

our original face is never ours alone.

our original face is always elsewhere, always others. we are blind beneath
the surface; we carry atmosphere with us, refusing union. union alone
extricates the flesh from the flesh. our original face is flesh.

in "our" work, we work the original face. we play against technology,
memory, direct and indirect addressing. we participate in the irruptive
economy of desire, arousal, trembling.

the body shimmers in repetition: stutters / shudders / shivers / shatters
/ spatters / smatters / clatters / clutters. repetition is always inexact;
the noise of the other, chthonic domain, is always in emergence. in "our"
work, this trembling scatters; objects return to part-objects without
memory of the w/hole. the images / videos / texts exist on the lip.

the lip is the guard and guardian of the other. the lip, labia, is the
other's entrance. the lip is the emergence of the word. it is all of the
word of the lip; the world is tongued.

the face is nub; the tongue, nub of the nub. the material of the world is
a matter of pressure; substance is the same against the same; the nub is
the lip or edge of differentiation, difference. what emerges from the nub
re-enters the nub; what the nub differentiates, returns to the same.

the representation of sex in "our" work is as explicit as possible. it is
as delineated as possible. it withdraws from the medical into the fantasm,
withdraws from the anatomical into the anatomical. it wavers among
anatomies.

it is as if the presentation were itself a text or inscription of sex, as
if all sex, all culture, were inscriptive, were process. but the same
presentation collapses; the inscription is within self-erasure, self-
disclosure; the sex were chemical, full-on, the catalyst of incandescent
arousal. (as if to imagine us whispering in your ear; as if to imagine
this is for you, and you alone; as if to imagine you have us in our
fullness, the scent, touch, and taste of it; as if we were your pocket
imaginary; as if we were your imaginary process and procedure, protocol
and program; as if we were your imaginary corporation. our body becomes
your own; it is unbecoming, wayward, contrary, sassy; it speaks words that
should not be spoken, gives away secrets that should be kept hidden. it
remains parenthetical; it overturns content, inverts, as our holes are
inverted, as our mouths inhale the remnants of language: as if we, as if
you, were parenthetical; as if parentheses were contradictory, unstable,
destabilizing, naked, reversing at high speed: )()()()()()()( in a
simulacrum of that repetition from your interior that raises the alarm.)(

it is not the reduction of 0*S nor the splayed inversion S/0 but that
signal or warning of loss 1^S in a process of absorption, a false S of sex
and the subject, sex and the city contract. it is not the diminution of
0+S, nor the reaffirmation of S^1. it is not the symbol nor symbolism, nor
the symbolic nor the semiotic; it is the semiosis of the subject absorbed
by the trembling of the parenthetical, holding at bay, beyond the Pale,
what is most feared, that of indiscriminate fucking, desire penetrating
beyond the criminality of the family, terrorisms and explosions at the
heart of the continent, produced by continentals, for continentals, that
theater of the real which is always and simultaneously contained and
uncontained.

that which is always a loss and a gain, a matrix and lost terms.

With CHRISTIAN BOK making his long-awaited United
States appearance in Manhattan at the Drawing Center
this coming Tuesday, Dec. 4th,---

here's the URL for my little homage and parsing of his
invented extraterrestrial language:

http://www.geocities.com/jeffreyjullich/EUNOIAN.LITTLE.LEXICON.htm

(I apologize for what a poor job I've done with it
[and with everything in my life], but I thought the
good cause of calling attention to Bok's genius at
this time outweighed the ongoing public service of
concealing my incompetences.)

to understand what things meant would be tragic. A failure of =
nervousness. I cant gesticulate enough. Ape me you.          Thus =
I.Disastrous. A bolt. About this time the green and blue music entered =
on hurrying tip toe to a grandstand cacophony as if a nation had been =
slaughtered. Reality kept on: we  couldnt fix that, but there were =
pressing intrusions. I want you: youwant. He wants, she wants, they =
want. Everyone wants. There is a heaviness blacks the land. What is it =
with you? It's...Christ it's getting hot. Plant something. Are they =
caming?  Will they be caming? What's that? Who's this? And so on as a =
thousand vermilion vermin settled in. Ours of course to laud and chuckle =
over as the chairs rock unattended and vacant of personas. The wind, =
apropos of nowt, whips the air and all become involved in the drama with =
the chilling fingers and maybe the Laocoon. The death that young men =
yearn for. They keep wandering. A hundred thousand died last week and =
things are everywhere. And they flash or wink in a violent opposition of =
clangs, bangs, and clashes of shatter-light. All this and more: and =
still more, setting store and we are thus bereft to consider the clammy =
cells and the days of April: the days of yore when petrol pingle pangled =
out of Big Tree Cans until you fucked with various heads, fucker.=20

But all this is much more than it is. In fact it is much more than more =
than what it is. Much much more than more  you whore. All this being =
more: I being you and you seeking me and us as we seek you and indeed =
ever shall into endless edges. The great sea turns white. And why =
shouldnt it?  Nothing is. And yet the Thing playing about his frontage =
had sleight. Some sort of lusty legerdemain. Les Main Sales. They are. =
It all started with: "You dirty boy." The house leaked like a =
palindrome; but never completely as if a savage and incomprehensible =

Subject:      David Gascoyne Dies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 28 2001

One of the last survivors from the literary 1930s,
David Gascoyne once described himself as “a poet who
wrote himself out when young and then went mad”. Like
a not dissimilar predecessor, Chatterton, he was a
“marvellous boy” in his time, original and creatively
precocious in his youth and early manhood.
Like those two similarly precocious spirits of that
era, George Barker (a close friend) and Dylan Thomas,
he was essentially a neo-Romantic and had something of
the self-destructive impulse which went with that. In
the ultimate analysis he promised more than he could
deliver. But what he did deliver was, in the early
days certainly, completely unusual and arresting.

Like Barker and Thomas, too, and in contrast to the
other leading English poets of the age, Auden,
Spender, Empson, MacNeice and Day Lewis, he had not
been to university, a fact that may account for the
sense of inner spontaneity, a spirit completely free
of cleverness.

Yet Gascoyne was familiar with contemporary Europe and
European philosophical and artistic movements to a
degree many of his contemporaries were not, and was in
tune with Surrealism and Existentialism in their early
days. The involvement with Surrealism tended, in the
end, to hang like an albatross round his neck, and he
had to repudiate it. But gradually, as the years went
by, and he and his work emerged from beneath the wreck
of his early hopes, the scope of his lifetime’s
achievement as poet, translator and memoirist became
apparent.

David Emery Gascoyne was born the son of a bank
manager in Harrow in 1916 and educated at Salisbury
Choir School. There, his restless creativity somewhat
alarmed his stolidly bourgeois parents.

At Regent Street Polytechnic he met George Barker, who
was to become one of his greatest friends. But he
failed his exams and left in 1932.

Gascoyne was 16 in 1932 when Auden’s The Orators and
his own imagistic Roman Balcony and Other Poems were
published. It was the beginning of an auspicious
period for him: in 1933 A. R. Orage published Ten
Proses and Surrealist Cameos in The New English
Weekly; Geoffrey Grigson included Gascoyne’s first
purely “automatic” Surrealist poem, And the Seventh
Dream is the Dream of Isis, in one of the early
numbers of New Verse, which had appeared for the first
time that year; Alida Monro persuaded Cobden-Sanderson
to publish Gascoyne’s first and only full-length
novel, Opening Day.

The advance royalties made it possible for him to make
his first visit to Paris, where he spent his 17th
birthday. In Paris he made several new acquaintances,
including Cyril Connolly, visited the ateliers of S.W.
Hayter, Max Ernst and Jean Hélion, and met Paul Eluard
and Salvador Dalí. … By the mid-1930s Gascoyne had
become prolific as poet, novelist, essayist and
reviewer. Apart from New Verse his poems and
translations were printed in The European Quarterly,
The Bookman, the New Statesman and Nation and in the
Left Review symposium of 1937, Authors Take Sides on
the Spanish War, among others.

Gascoyne returned to Paris in 1935 to research a book
on Surrealism. He was already in correspondence with
Eluard, and he met André Breton who made a lasting
impression on him. His A Short Survey of Surrealism
(1935), with a dust jacket designed by Max Ernst, was
the first book-length historical account of the
movement in English. It was followed in 1936 by his
own collection of Surrealist poems, Man’s Life Is This
Meat, and by his translations of Breton’s What is
Surrealism? Back in England in 1936 he co-curated the
International Surrealist Exhibition with Roland
Penrose and Herbert Read at the Burlington Galleries
(where with the aid of a spanner he was able to
extricate Dalí from suffocation in a diving suit as he
delivered a lecture).

In November, and now a member of the Communist Party,
he travelled from Paris with Roland and Valentine
Penrose to Spain in the throes of civil war. In
Barcelona, he translated news bulletins during the
day, broadcasting them in English each evening for the
propaganda bureau of the Catalonian government, from a
studio near the port.

Gascoyne travelled backwards and forwards from England
to the Continent throughout the rest of the decade,
living in Paris for long periods between 1937 and
1939. His Journals of that time reveal friendships
with Dylan Thomas, Julian Trevelyan, Kathleen Raine,
Antonia White and Norman Cameron, who introduced him
to American poetry, which he found “more exciting than
English poetry”. Anäis Nin, Lawrence Durrell and Henry
Miller, too, were among his friends.

In the Journals he records his disenchantment with
Surrealism and search for a new poetic language and
sensibility; his struggle to come to terms with his
homosexuality; his growing amphetamine addiction; and
his engagement with Existentialist philosophy.

In 1937 he first made contact with the
poet-philosopher Benjamin Fondane and discovered
Pierre Jean Jouve. It was a significant turning point.
He entered into analysis for several months with
Jouve’s psychiatrist wife, Blanche Reverchon.
Gascoyne’s Hölderlin’s Madness (1938), with four
original poems interpolated in the “free adaptations”
of the German poet, was his response to Jouve’s Poèmes
de la folie de Hölderlin. In Gascoyne’s third
collection, Poems 1937-42 (1943, with eight striking
reproductions in colour by Graham Sutherland), he
found his mature voice and emerged as a religious
poet. Cyril Connolly claimed that the poems “take us
in their chill, calm, sensitive language as near the
edge of the precipice as a human being is able to go
and still turn back”.

Gascoyne failed his medical for military service, and
worked for a short time early in the war as a ship’s
cook, then joined ENSA. On his first postwar visit in
1947 to Paris and the café frequented by the
Surrealists he was “excommunicated” from the group by
Breton who, after reading his Ecce Homo, accused him
of being a Roman Catholic.

Gascoyne’s postwar work lacks his previous intensity.
His satirical one-act play, The Hole in the Wall, on
the state of English theatre (pre-Osborne and Pinter)
was produced in 1950, the year A Vagrant and other
poems was published. In autumn 1951 Gascoyne, Kathleen
Raine and W. S. Graham left for the US, where they
gave readings as “Three Younger British Poets”.

Back in Britain Longmans Green commissioned his Thomas
Carlyle (1952) for their series Writers and their
Work, but Gascoyne was suffering from writer’s block,
the first of several instances of the affliction.
Then, in 1953, Douglas Cleverdon commissioned Night
Thoughts for the BBC Third Programme. This he finished
and it was first broadcast on December 7, 1955,
offering to listeners the essence of his “religio
poetae”.

The following year he attended the first performance,
with Peter Pears as soloist, of his poem, Requiem,
written in Paris in the late 1930s for the composer
Priaulx Rainier as a text to be set to music.

Between 1954 and 1964 Gascoyne lived in France,
publishing very little. Then, after a serious
breakdown, he returned to England to live with his
parents on the Isle of Wight. He worried that his
parents must think him “a complete failure” and was
relieved when his Collected Poems appeared the
following year. After his father’s death acute
depression dogged him and over the next 11 years he
endured further periods in hospital.

His marriage, in 1975, to Judy Lewis, restored much
self-esteem. He began to write again, contributing
reviews, translations, and occasionally poems, to
newspapers and periodicals. The publication — in the
order of their mysterious reappearance —- of Paris
Journal 1937-39 in 1978 and Journal 1936-37 in 1980
brought enthusiastic reviews.

In May 1981 in Paris he took part in Homage to David
Gascoyne, organised jointly with the British Council,
and a selection of his translated poems became a
university set text, Miserere (Granit, 1989), in
France. He achieved public recognition in Italy, too,
where he was presented with the Premio Biella-Poesia
Europea for his translated collection La Mano del
Poeta (1982). In 1985 his translation of Breton’s and
Philippe Soupault’s Les Champs Magnétiques was
published as The Magnetic Fields.

The past ten years have seen the publication of
several works (some recovered from limbo): Selected
Poems (1994); Selected Verse Translations (1996);
Selected Prose 1934-1996 (1998); Encounter with
Silence: Poems 1950 (1998); A Short Survey of
Surrealism (reprint, 2000); and April: a novella
(2000). In 1996 Gascoyne was appointed a Chevalier de
l’Ordre des Arts et Lettres in London by the French
Minister of Culture.

In the 1990s he suffered a serious fall, breaking his
pelvis. From this he recovered, but his frail,
stooping but impressive figure became gradually less
mobile.

David Gascoyne is survived by his wife Judy.



David Gascoyne, poet, was born on October 10, 1916. He
died on November 25, 2001, aged 85.

-----------------

Poetry

This was a rich year for poetry, to which the country has begun to turn
as it comes to grips with the altered zeitgeist.

New translations and editions of work by the late Paul Celan, Eugenio
Montale and (further back) Horace were matched by important translations
of poets Tomaz Salamun (Twisted Spoon), Mahmoud Darwish (Syracuse) and
Christophe Tarkos (Roof). A collection of David Bromwich's elegant
review-essays and of James Fenton's Oxonian lectures furthered inquiry
into tradition and the individual talent.

Meanwhile, Anne Carson's The Beauty of the Husband and the ever famous
Seamus Heaney's Electric Light turned on readers old and new. Kevin
Young's ambitious To Repel Ghosts, riffing on Jean-Michel Basquiat's
life and work, should continue to generate attention, despite the demise
of its publisher, Zoland Books. Strong work appeared from Elizabeth
Alexander, Bruce Andrews, Wanda Coleman, Cornelius Eady, Forrest Gander,
Alice Fulton, Michael Gizzi, John Godfrey, W.S. Di Piero, Adrienne Rich,
Charles Simic and Keith Waldrop. There were terrific debuts by Taylor
Brady, Robert Fitterman, Judith Goldman, Camille Guthrie and Noelle
Kocot.

Rooms Are Never Finished by Agha Shahid Ali (Norton). Ali's third book
continues his laments for and meditations on his homeland of Kashmir,
occasioned this time by his mother's death and his subsequent journey
back with her body. Grief, religion and politics intermingle as they do
in real life, but here put through the tight, historically charged
ghazal form.

A Border Comedy by Lyn Hejinian (Granary). Pleasure, boundary,
barbarian, comedy--Hejinian's latest and possibly best book shows us a
contemplative path to firmer lexical ground, brilliantly mixing daily
reflection with modes of theory, drama, epic and fable. Yet Hejinian
never diminishes the real dangers of actual crossings, and argues
forcefully that our mental borders are directly analogous to the
physical.

Atet A.D. by Nathaniel Mackey (City Lights). Mackey is an
extraordinarily accomplished maverick poet, editor and critic, and this
third installment in the escapades of his Mystic Horn Society--a
fictional jazz ensemble that microcosmically concentrates the
ins-and-outs of verbal, spiritual, and musical relationships--has all
the charged verve of Henry James encountering Charlie Parker's Ko-Ko and
perfectly transcribing every note and nuance.

New and Collected Poems by Czeslaw Milosz (Ecco). This has been a good
year for valedictory volumes for working poets (Yusef Komunyakaa, Ann
Lauterbach, Paul Muldoon, Rae Armantrout, Gerard Malanga, Paul
Vangelisti) and late ones (Merrill, Cavafy, Empson), but this monumental
edition of the Polish-American poet's work, suffused with the 20th
century's darkest hours, speaks directly to the unfolding of the 21st.

Disobedience by Alice Notley (Penguin). Notley has been a poet's poet
since the late '60s and began to reach a wider audience with 1998's
Mysteries of Small Houses. This book should be the clincher: a
world-breakingly disobedient self trying to make sense of global systems
beyond our reach, but not our thought.

        Doubtless Adeena Karasick's most accessible - and to my mind best -
work

to date, The Arugula Fugues take off from the epigraph:


           Huddled in the shadow of these syllables
                dwells the troubled grammar of
                    so many sentences.


The Fugues that follow are a joy to read.  Funny and wonderfully punny,
Karasick's Fugues trip lightly through the labials of many cultures.
Though her language flows in ordered syllables that mirror the
grammatical constructions with which English-speakers are most familiar,
embedded in this "natural" sequence is a multilingual world of word-play
that suggests how we make words mean.

        While the riffs on Indian culture and comestibles in "Fugue IV" are
readily recognizable, as are many of the French and German words and
word-plays throughout these texts, what may not be so obvious to those
unfamiliar with Ashkenazi culture is the enormous wealth of Yiddishkeit
that imbues this work.  The title itself, for instance, can be read to
suggest not only the salad of choice among sophisticates of certain
social strata but the small, elegant, yeasted crescents redolent of
cinnamon - rugula pl. rugulach - that are a staple of Ashkenazi Sabbath,
bar mitzvah, and post-funeral tables.  Throughout Karasick's Fugues, the
wonderful melt-in-the-mouth sweetness of freshly-baked rugulach is set
off and balanced by the astringent and sometimes almost bitter bite of
the arugula.  This doubling and layering of meanings is typical of the
Fugues,  and in this instance provides keys and clues for reading them.

        As always in Karasick's writing, the oral/aural and the labial/labial
dance together.  The act of speaking/making meaning is sexualized, as
creative acts are in many  cultures, the paradigmatic act of creation
being procreation.  The gendered Hebrew god alone creates the universe
singly, asexually, by the act of invocation, thus forever sexualizing
language and acts of speaking and making.  Karasick plants herself
firmly in the traditions that have arisen from this vision, in The
Arugula Fugues combining the act of creation/invocation with an almost
shamanistic musicality.  The result is a process of hymnology wherein
the notion of the fugue constructs and permeates a verbal feast.  Thus
Karasick's Fugues  [polyphonic compositions "constructed on one or more
short subjects or themes, which are harmonized according to the laws of
counterpoint and introduced from time to time with various contrapuntal
devices"  (SOED quoting Stainer and Barrett)] might serve as psalms for
a multi-ethnic, multilingual community of readers bound by belief in the
primacy of language and the efficacy of invocation.

        All this comes packaged in full-mouthed, delicious syllables, glorious
glossals, frolicking fricatives used to send up current cultural
iconographies as well as to invoke a multitude of feasts and
traditions.  I love, for instance, Karasick's "Phat gerund!" and
"jubilato gelato latté" [Fugue III], her "ravaged in the frangipani
panji gange" and "Hey bo idly -  // Here we go dosa do" in Fugue IV.
Perhaps what I like best about this work is the
twinning/twining/fuguing/intertextualization of food and word/food and
world.  Food here mediates invocation and embodiment, word and world, a
use that mirrors both our everyday experience and a host of
mythologies.  Tastily, Karasick's Arugula Fugues  fill the mouth with a
mélange of exuberant erudition and votive vocatives.

A companion to My Way, Charles Bernstein=92s 1999 montage of essays,=20
conversations, and poems, With Strings is a compilation of sixty-nine poems=
=20
in various forms and styles, dating mostly from the 1990s. With its=20
fractured nursery rhymes, distressed mottoes, runcible riddles, and=20
inscrutable sayings, Bernstein takes us on a poetic trip that swerves from=
=20
the comic to the political, from the whimsical to the elegiac.

"In With Strings, Charles Bernstein plays 'Charles Bernstein' with furious=
=20
comedic virtuosity, very much as Lenny Bruce played 'Lenny Bruce' or=20
Charlie Chaplin 'Charlie Chaplin.' The comparison of this remarkable=20
collection of poems with the work of such serious and defiant comedians is=
=20
indicative of only one facet of Bernstein=92s writings, but it is apt: his=
=20
work is iconoclastic and revolutionary. Bernstein=92s poetry, however, is=20
driven by aesthetic as well as social passions. The poems that are With=20
Strings are addressed to the great questions perpetually facing art: What=20
is it? Why is it? How is it? And in this context, inevitably, the presence=
=20
of artlessness is discovered close at hand, never to be subsumed. It is in=
=20
poetry=92s encounter with what is never to be subsumed that the brilliance=
 of=20
Bernstein=92s work erupts." -- Lyn Hejinian

"Charles Bernstein is one of the finest poets writing today, and certainly=
=20
one of our greatest satirists. His poetry presents a profound and highly=20
individual critique of contemporary half-truths, speech forms, and modes of=
=20
expression, and does it so graphically and with such great good humor that=
=20
the reader is left breathless=97laughing and crying at the same time as the=
=20
shocks of recognition register." -- Marjorie Perloff

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present two compelling events this
weekend:

Saturday, December 1, 2001
Series X: On Translation
4 pm: Panel Discussion
8 pm: Reading

Slight changes to this event announced below

Open Borders,  Series X: On Translation will include an afternoon
panelmoderated by Michael Palmer with translators Pierre Joris, Jen Hofer,
Walter Lew, and Diane Weipert, as well as an evening reading of poetry
they've translated from North Africa, Korea, Mexico and Cuba, introduced
by Myung Mi Kim. Hosted by Elizabeth Treadwell Jackson.



Sunday, December 2, 2001 at 2 p.m.
Crosstown Traffic -- Tanya Hollis & Amanda Hughen

Visual artists Tanya Hollis and Amanda Hughen will present and discuss
their work and processes. Tanya Hollis attended New College of the
University of South Florida, receiving a BA in Religion with a thesis on
women's roles in slave religion in the South, and then SUNY-Buffalo for
her Masters in Library Science. She now resides in San Francisco, and is
currently the Acting Director at the California Historical Society's North
Baker Research Library. Hollis will be talking about her job as an
archivist and its implications in her work as a visual artist; she is also
a sculptor, using  mainly found objects, and is involved in the Bay Area
poetry scene. Amanda Hughen is a visual artist who looks at utilitarian
forms in the built environment, and explores the nuance that emerges from
the repetition of forms within a system. Hughen has shown throughout the
Bay Area, at such venues as the San Francisco Art Commission Gallery, The
Luggage Store, a.o.v., Refusalon, the San Francisco Art Institute, and
Southern Exposure. She has been an artist in residence at the DeYoung
Museum Artists Studio, and an affiliate artist at the Headlands Center for
the Arts. Hosted by Yedda Morrison.

        Hi I am back after what seems like an eternity away from the cyber world. I
am happily in my new home and things are well. I wanted to say thanks to all
who helped out in awful time. Things are now well. The cats are ok too. I am
sorry if I left any unfinished business web wise. I have been unplugged and
placing boxes. During the Thanksgiving holiday I wrote a series of poems.
They are based on TV shows. This is my gift to say thanks for all the
support over these past months. If you do not like them please return them
and get something you like. I still have the receipt. I hope you are all
well. Now to sift through 1543 messages.

A belated Happy Thanksgiving, Geoffrey

Gilligan goes down to the lagoon
and reflects fortune


The skipper will be mad
He is always mad


But I am his little buddy,
And his anger will fade .

It is my leaf to rot
under shaded grey palms

My shirt is red
The professor
wears white.
The Skipper blue

The first season we just were shades of grey

The Howell's have lost money

Again,   my fault.
I stumbled the radio went out. Even Ginger is upset.
Mary Ann's lip quivers

my fault
Would you care to have me in your home If it wasn't

Would I still be?

Funny

Fingers point and hats hit my head

But around me you keep
It is my leaf to turn

time spots for towered hearts




I am Gilligan and this is my island

our peril is comedy
Popular myths twist

Send a message from a seashell
Our logos is our struggle to come home

Our prison is paradise
And I foil all attempts to leave

A lagoon of blue
A coconut brown

Our paradise is prison
Ad astra per aspera

Beastmaster

For Jeffrey Jullich





It is the tale of snake and lion

Again

A blond man
A bald man
each holding a knife

The snake the natural king rides high under his horse.

Find that girl -- she is the only thing that stands
between me and him.

Our fight will be with knives.

The beast uses teeth and claw
The men need tools.

High above
their protector animal spirit evaporates against technology.

His blond hair matches his brown loin cloth

The snake is in black and the woman too wears brown cloth

You dare defy your king?
You were never my king!
Then you will die!


But he does not die. Nor does lion kill snake.
He leaves him for another day.

It is better to know your enemy lives
than have to face an unknown foe.



I die when the series ends and not a moment before.
This is part of the reason you watch.


At camp
The woman prepares to go

They both know
She cannot stay,
Our thin plot would thicken. And next week
we need a new object to fight over.


We will be again
When the sun is warm and the viewers respond

And the snake aligns for the lion

Again

Ab Ovo : A  Star Trek poem


Geordie in 10 forward




When I replicate an egg salad sandwich with olives

It tastes like egg salad


Its saw no brine
no feathers

Yeast doesn't live here anymore


the organic feeds from fiction





And there
is no need for profit

Why build wealth for some when all may participate

Starfleet provides improved community through technology and all things grow
from light --

like crystal made from stars
this sandwich eats me as much as I eat it.

Dodie Bellamy's Cunt-Ups is an endearing little book, snug, looking very
much like a stocking stuffer. A small mouse on its cover is peering into th=
e
darkness. That is, the eternal, glowing night of intense dedication to
eating pussy, to sucking cock, to getting fucked.

Edited Leni Riefenstahl-style, in a chopped-up litany of escalating desire,
Cunt-Ups constantly reorients: "In the sky I thought I might come," it
tenderly says more than once. This always new monster of sexual description
and intent is constructed as an homage to the cut-up technique of William
Burroughs and maybe more important the late Kathy Acker. Bellamy generously
describes her method at the back of the book. "I used a variety of texts by
myself and others." Then she divided each page of text into four squares an=
d
mixed the squares up so that each page was now two or three parts her own
work and one or two of someone else's. Which then she reworked.
Her reworking is where the excitement comes in. Bellamy's fresh use of this
staple of avant-gardism advances maybe the most important stage of feminism
yet: a gorgeous and excessive forgetting. Don't we need to dispense with
being only or specifically female to be fully human, to join and even
orchestrate the mess? Her seams of meaning are frequently sound: "I have a
cunt so that I can fit about the cloud plowed under. Puzzle." There are
other moments where it sounds like what is being constructed is faith: ". .
. your eyes will be open," her creature fervently promises. "There you woul=
d
be with tears and blood and crosses in my eyes. . . . " But the impish
sexual narrative always prevails: " . . . you would suck my lungs, and you
would." Like her previous books (Feminine Hijinx, The Letters of Mina
Harker, and in the anthology High Risk), she writes with the sheen of a
professional gambler. In Cunt-Ups, it's why her cut-ups rock. It's all art,
but her talking dirty makes us desperately want to play.

Here's something  D & M* from a real pro. BBC news says today:

"Poet laureate Andrew Motion has written a poem for the BBC's live coverage
of the Westminster Abbey service in memory of the British people who died
in the US attacks on 11 September. [....] His role includes marking special
state events with a poem, and previous works include the marriage of Prince
Edward to Sophie Rhys Jones and the Queen Mother's 100th birthday
celebrations."

Here it is:

                     The Voices Live, by Andrew Motion

           The voices live which are the voices lost:
           we hear them and we answer, or we try
           but words are nervous when we need them most
           and shutter, stop, or dully slide away

           so everything they mean to summon up
           is always just too far, just out of reach,
           unless our memories give time the slip
           and learn the lesson that heart-wisdoms teach

           of how in grief we find a way to keep
           the dead beside us as our time goes on -
           invisible and silent but the deep
           foundation of ourselves, our cornerstone.

THE HOSTAGE NATION

Hans von Sponeck
and Denis Halliday

Guardian
Thursday November 29, 2001

A major shift is occurring in US policy on Iraq. It is obvious that
Washington wants to end 11 years of a self-serving policy of containment
of the Iraqi regime and change to a policy of replacing, by force,
Saddam Hussein and his government.

The current policy of economic sanctions has destroyed society in Iraq
and caused the death of thousands, young and old. There is evidence of
that daily in reports from reputable international organizations such as
Caritas, Unicef, and Save the Children. A change to a policy of
replacement by force will increase that suffering.

The creators of the policy must no longer assume that they can satisfy
voters by expressing contempt for those who oppose them. The problem is
not the inability of the public to understand the bigger picture, as
former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright likes to suggest. It is
the opposite. The bigger picture, the hidden agenda, is well understood
by ordinary people. We should not forget Henry Kissinger's brutally
frank admission that "oil is much too important a commodity to be left
in the hands of the Arabs".

How much longer can democratically elected governments hope to get away
with justifying policies that punish the Iraqi people for something they
did not do, through economic sanctions that target them in the hope that
those who survive will overthrow the regime? Is international law only
applicable to the losers? Does the UN security council only serve the
powerful?

The UK and the US, as permanent members of the council, are fully aware
that the UN embargo operates in breach of the UN covenants on human
rights, the Geneva and Hague conventions and other international laws.
It is neither anti-UK nor anti-US to point out that Washington and
London, more than anywhere else, have in the past decade helped to write
the Iraq chapter in the history of avoidable tragedies.

The UK and the US have deliberately pursued a policy of punishment since
the Gulf war victory in 1991. The two governments have consistently
opposed allowing the UN security council to carry out its mandated
responsibilities to assess the impact of sanctions policies on
civilians. We know about this first hand, because the governments
repeatedly tried to prevent us from briefing the security council about
it. The pitiful annual limits, of less than $170 per person, for
humanitarian supplies, set by them during the first three years of the
oil-for-food programme are unarguable evidence of such a policy.

We have seen the effects on the ground and cannot comprehend how the US
ambassador, James Cunningham, could look into the eyes of his colleagues
a year ago and say: "We (the US government) are satisfied that the
oil-for-food programme is meeting the needs of the Iraqi people."
Besides the provision of food and medicine, the real issue today is that
Iraqi oil revenues must be invested in the reconstruction of civilian
infrastructure destroyed in the Gulf war.

Despite the severe inadequacy of the permitted oil revenue to meet the
minimum needs of the Iraqi people, 30 cents (now 25) of each dollar that
Iraqi oil earned from 1996 to 2000 were diverted by the UN security
council, at the behest of the UK and US governments, to compensate
outsiders for losses allegedly incurred because of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. If this money had been made available to Iraqis, it could have
saved many lives.

The uncomfortable truth is that the west is holding the Iraqi people
hostage, in order to secure Saddam Hussein's compliance to ever-shifting
demands. The UN secretary-general, who would like to be a mediator, has
repeatedly been prevented from taking this role by the US and the UK
governments.

The imprecision of UN resolutions on Iraq - "constructive ambiguity" as
the US and UK define it - is seen by those governments as a useful tool
when dealing with this kind of conflict. The US and UK dismiss criticism
by pointing out that the Iraqi people are being punished by Baghdad. If
this is true, why do we punish them further?

The most recent report of the UN secretary-general, in October 2001,
says that the US and UK governments' blocking of $4bn of humanitarian
supplies is by far the greatest constraint on the implementation of the
oil-for-food programme. The report says that, in contrast, the Iraqi
government's distribution of humanitarian supplies is fully satisfactory
(as it was when we headed this programme). The death of some 5-6,000
children a month is mostly due to contaminated water, lack of medicines
and malnutrition. The US and UK governments' delayed clearance of
equipment and materials is responsible for this tragedy, not Baghdad.

The expectation of a US attack on Iraq does not create conditions in the
UN security council suited to discussions on the future of economic
sanctions. This year's UK-sponsored proposal for "smart sanctions" will
not be retabled. Too many people realize that what looked superficially
like an improvement for civilians is really an attempt to maintain the
bridgeheads of the existing sanctions policy: no foreign investments and
no rights for the Iraqis to manage their own oil revenues.

The proposal suggested sealing Iraq's borders, strangling the Iraqi
people. In the present political climate, a technical extension of the
current terms is considered the most expedient step by Washington. That
this condemns more Iraqis to death and destitution is shrugged off as
unavoidable.

What we describe is not conjecture. These are undeniable facts known to
us as two former insiders. We are outraged that the Iraqi people
continue to be made to pay the price for the lucrative arms trade and
power politics. We are reminded of Martin Luther King's words: "A time
has come when silence is betrayal. That time is now."

We want to encourage people everywhere to protest against unscrupulous
policies and against the appalling disinformation put out about Iraq by
those who know better, but are willing to sacrifice people's lives with
false and malicious arguments.

The US Defense Department, and Richard Butler, former head of the UN
arms inspection team in Baghdad, would prefer Iraq to have been behind
the anthrax scare. But they had to recognize that it had its origin
within the US.

British and US intelligence agencies know well that Iraq is
qualitatively disarmed, and they have not forgotten that the outgoing
secretary of defense, William Powell, told incoming President George
Bush in January: "Iraq no longer poses a military threat to its
neighbours". The same message has come from former UN arms inspectors.
But to admit this would be to nail the entire UN policy, as it has been
developed and maintained by the US and UK governments.

We are horrified by the prospects of a new US-led war against Iraq. The
implications of "finishing unfinished business" in Iraq are too serious
for the global community to ignore. We hope that the warnings of leaders
in the Middle East and all of us who care about human rights are not
ignored by the US government. What is now most urgently needed is an
attack on injustice, not on the Iraqi people.

Hans von Sponeck was UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq from 1998 to
2000; Denis Halliday held the same post from 1997 to 1998.

This looks like a superior poetry contest to me.  Too bad an institution
like
SF State has to charge poets to enter it.  My boilerplate on this is that if
you
don't appreciate poetry enough to publish poets or award prizes to them
without charging them money to submit their work, you should go way.

of the considerate


consider just for the moment, for the play of words; as if this were
written in linux, i'd go back already and change everything in the world

this isn't a poem, literature; this is a request; consider just for a
moment, for the play of the moment, the benefits of mass destruction

elimination of every man, woman, child, on the face of the planet

stranded astronauts

even miners going beneath within; the violent disease-bearing clouds of
radiation flooding; consider this, the benefits for all of us - the end of
all information and media; yes, now we can theorize endlessly about this

there are vast curtains in the sky, they are slowly closing

in one or several centuries, in millennia, things growing, clawing back,
like it was, nearly like it was

almost a model of how it had been, but something not there, something on
the order of furious perception

nothing, perhaps a rock or stick or stone; nothing, perhaps sand or mud or
bark; nothing, perhaps a vine or clay or branch

health upwells from the submerged womb of the planet; almost health; now
we can theorize endlessly; then, we shall be silent; then, we shall
declare nothing; then, neither relative nor absolute, neither defined nor
erased, neither subject nor object

not even the tiniest name; but a glance, a knowledge of determination;
among friends now

consider just for a moment no human alive; ideology, pollution under
erasure; value always already the result of a past posterior of
absolutely no account; there are no ruins; an enormous planet; sunrise
sunset; lunar phases; storms of infinite night and day; comets close to
the presence of sound; storms

we may sleep tonight in comfort recognizing the curtains; they close from
above; they close from side to side

we may sleep dreamless, just for once, just this very night

before the stage recedes, from the presence and gathering of the world

It's a time of giving, and as you think about what you want to support as=20
this difficult year comes to an end, please think about supporting a=20
literary small press by making a book purchase for you or friends.

For those interested in the book as an object and in a tradition of fine=20
imaginative bookmaking, and for those interested in reading contemporary=20
works of imagination, Chax Press has chosen some possible gifts for the=20

=20
visual and literary gifts.

1. Chartings, by Lyn Hejinian and Ray DiPalma
         First released in 2000, these twenty collaborative poems are each=
=20
printed letterpress on handmade Japanese paper that is torn and collaged=20
into an oversize book whose pages have been printed with large wood block=20
letters and numbers, the whole forming a spacious realm in which meaning=20
floats and seems uncontained. The binding is made of two signatures sewn=20
and pasted into boards that have been covered with red Moriki paper. We=20
have a few copies remaining.
Retail: $320
This offer: $210

2. Levinas and the Police, by Benjamin Hollander
         In this book, the pamphlet of letterpress-printed poems and a=20

=20
and sewn into Japanese mulberry paper. This structure is housed in Fabriano=

painter Bracha Lichtenberg-Ettinger. This is our newest book
Retail: $110
This offer: $80

published in 1984 as the final book of Charles Alexander's Black Mesa Press.
Retail: $75
This offer: $40


Also, from Chax's trade paperback offerings, please consider the following.

4. Traffic, by Gil Ott
         John Taggart writes:
         =93The book is looking forward with empty hands, toward you.=94 So:=
 a=20
sort of gesture, perhaps a sort of supplication. What is being asked? Only=
=20
that you enter =93the place in between, where poetry occurs.=94 As an=
 architect=20
of the gap, Gil Ott provides many doors whereby this place may be entered=20
and whereby you may encounter and be part of the =93traffic=94 of that=20
occurrence. It=92s not a house of many mansions, but it is poetry, a place=
=20
which may not take place unless you enter. So: a different sort of gesture,=
=20
one of welcome invitation. Think it over. What have other hands offered you=
=20
lately?

         from Traffic:
She=92s here. Hold
in my hand, that comprehensible
image, weight and intent her
true record left fixed
light and shadow, the muscle
bought relaxes. We=92d make



succession of faces over eight pages. If you can pay for it, you have every=
=20
right. You=92re a fool if you can=92t decide. Watch your fingerprints. The=
=20
paper alone is enough.=94

Retail: $14
This offer: $10

5. 3 of 10, by Hank Lazer
         Jack Foley writes:
         The excitement of this writing, this =93lyricism of reading,=94 is=
 its=20
ability to track the course of a drive towards freedom. In opposition to=20
Keats=92s problematical evocation of the imagination, =93magic casements,=20
opening on the foam / Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn,=94 Lazer=20
asserts that poets are =93portals multiply open.=94 3 of 10 gives us=
 something=20
of the story of how he arrived at that formulation. It is a formulation=20
deeply involved with a perception about mythology, for to think=20
mythologically is to think chordally, in clusters of simultaneously-sounded=
=20
=93tones.=94 That is the kind of thinking =97 and writing =97 we =93hear=94=
 in this=20
deeply conscious, deeply self-conscious work.
Retail: $14
This offer: $10

6. Demo to Ink, by Ron Silliman
         This book includes six consecutive works from the author=92s=
 ongoing=20
The Alphabet project. Silliman=92s work is one of the most provocative,=20
moving, joyful, challenging, and profoundly architectonic projects of our=20
time.

         Hank Lazer writes:
=93The words combine, forming meaning.=94 We witness it, and we know we are=
=20
witnessing; therefore, we are not merely witnesses, but participants,=20
collaborators, accessories. Playing a blue-jeaned Wittgenstein, he revels=20
in the endless variety of how sentences come to mean. His books are poems,=
=20
we are reading poems, we are asked to think about it. =93Think here: you are=
=20
reading a poem // =97 already this defines you.=94 Not this: flip the pages,=
 he=20
reached for her whatever, she responded, castle or condo in the background,=
=20
it was so real I thought I was really there, I didn=92t even know I was=20
reading a book. Instead, the integrity of the line and of the sentence:=20
=93That each line be created equal is contra-narrative.=94 What might such=
=20
citizens do? Let=92s see. Cheetahs never prosper. I learned quickly to love=
=20
his love of puns and to respect the necessity of their interruption of=20
other more consecutive forms of logic. Who only can lecture should not have=
=20
children. A love of melopoeia makes a good daddy (enough to sustain the=20
love of twins, of w hich punning is such a love). What was I about to say?=
=20
I=92ll think of it again later. That very word =93later.=94

Retail: $11
This offer: $8

7. A Reading 8-10, by Beverly Dahlen
         Jessica Grim and Melanie Nielsen write:
         Here her true unlike-anythingness, hear her see through, somehow=20
about you, the =93privacy in invention=94 becomes a reading. Dahlen=92s is a=
=20
gorgeous argument, methodical, indexed by an intricate thinking. Historical=
=20
and future, desire and emptiness. Simple. Mythical. =93the antithesis of=20
primal words=94 is primal too. A reading how it goes out remnants,=
 resistant,=20
her far and wide a future tense timed swing shift speaks up, generative =97=
=20
expect something else. =93here was twisting, all kinds of thorniness.=94
         Careful. A normal heroine astounds.

Retail: $12

Apologies for Cross-Posting

Information Aesthetics: Paranoia or Paradigm?

Thomas Pynchon defined paranoia as "the realization that _everything is
connected_, everything in the Creation..." For celebrants of chaos theory,
massive quantities of data pose the joyous possibility of achieving a state
of 'maximum information' or reveal the potentialities of 'pattern
recognition' as an organizational structure. The new media arts, hypertext
and the World Wide Web often toy with information overload and the
exuberant wealth of database systems to unite information with an aesthetic
dimension. Is there an aesthetics of information? If so, what forms does it
take and how does it function? What are the implications for the artforms
of the new media? Does it produce paranoia, nested networks, new modes of
organization, or...?

Your investigation might consider:
spatial and/or temporal navigation
hyperlinking
search engines, databases and/or archives
sequence, randomness, repetition, lists, series
narrative, anti-narrative, games
transparency, interactivity and/or control
speed, delay, friction
shape, colour, sound and/or noise
spacetime, depth, surface, interface
waves and particles
fractals, quantum computation, geometry
memory and/or forgetting
architecture, photography, cartography

Charles Bernstein

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A companion to My Way, Charles Bernstein=92s 1999 montage of essays,
conversations, and poems, With Strings is a compilation of sixty-nine poems
in various forms and styles, dating mostly from the 1990s. With its
fractured nursery rhymes, distressed mottoes, runcible riddles, and
inscrutable sayings, Bernstein takes us on a poetic trip that swerves from
the comic to the political, from the whimsical to the elegiac.

"In With Strings, Charles Bernstein plays 'Charles Bernstein' with furious
comedic virtuosity, very much as Lenny Bruce played 'Lenny Bruce' or
Charlie Chaplin 'Charlie Chaplin.' The comparison of this remarkable
collection of poems with the work of such serious and defiant comedians is
indicative of only one facet of Bernstein=92s writings, but it is apt: his
work is iconoclastic and revolutionary. Bernstein=92s poetry, however, is
driven by aesthetic as well as social passions. The poems that are With
Strings are addressed to the great questions perpetually facing art: What
is it? Why is it? How is it? And in this context, inevitably, the presence
of artlessness is discovered close at hand, never to be subsumed. It is in
poetry=92s encounter with what is never to be subsumed that the brilliance of
Bernstein=92s work erupts." -- Lyn Hejinian

"Charles Bernstein is one of the finest poets writing today, and certainly
one of our greatest satirists. His poetry presents a profound and highly
individual critique of contemporary half-truths, speech forms, and modes of
expression, and does it so graphically and with such great good humor that
the reader is left breathless=97laughing and crying at the same time as the
shocks of recognition register." -- Marjorie Perloff
