The good news/sad news story is that I just bought Ben Freidlander's
beautiful produced UC Press book remaindered at $9.25 (recently at Logos in
Santa Cruz.)
I find it so refreshing to be rereading him - that sense of grappling and
taking on 'the big subject' in dramatic, dogmatic ways - superficially, at
least, a utopian resolve that language will somehow cut through the mass and
reconfigure the works.  And sad to find that effort remaindered - which may
not so much be a reflection on the critical status and use of Charles Olson,
but on the sad financial condition of UC Press that, I assume,is cutting
loose all of its slower moving inventory in the interest of its own
survival.

I don't need a place, but I'm from the Hartford, CT area and know New Haven
reasonably well. I'm going to be in China for a conference myself in June.
You sound as though you live near State Street. I used to eat at Modern a
long time ago. I like Sally's and Pepe's a little better, but you don't have
to wait in hour-long lines at Modern.

Subject: New Haven Summer Sublet

Interested in a summer in New Haven?

Rent my apartment while I'm in China.

Two-bedroom, fully furnished, including digital cable, high-speed internet,
queen-sized bed, sofa-bed, futon, a separate dining room, huge kitchen, and
lots of books to browse through.

All for the great price of $1000 a month from late May to end of August. Big
enough to hold you & your friends (could conceivably sleep up to seven
without using the floor).

Convenient location near Modern Apizza (one of New Haven's most famous
pizzerias), liquor store, gas station, a Chinese fish market, two gourmet
grocers, a laundromat, video store, and many restaurants!

James Alan McPherson is among the most revered authors living and writing
in the United States. He spent his early career writing short stories and
essays, almost without exception, for The Atlantic. At the age of 35,
McPherson received a Pulitzer Prize for his collection of stories, Elbow
Room (1978); he was the first African-American writer to receive the award.
He is also the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship (1973) and the
MacArthur Foundation Award (the so-called "Genius Award"; 1981) and was
inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995.
Of the 1960s, he has written: "What was needed was a revolutionary model of
American identity, an imaginative aesthetic and moral foothold established
in the future, with little attention paid to race, toward which all
Americans might aspire." He adds: "It need not be emphasied that this did
not happen."

The Mysterious Light


http://www.asondheim.org/flame2.mov

strange sequence here... from vail colorado webcam...
the dots indicate defuge... exhaustion...

this is... last night a beam of light... continued and from daylight...
you can see... nothing there...

I'm curious what makes these "new media" readings?  Are they presenting
digital works?  Or does new media mean something else in this context?

I suppose it should be "new media if the venue had a laptop projector?"
or "intermedia on hard copy"?

intermedia, in media res, media itself, just out of the box. speaking of laptops, check out DAT Politics on the a-musik label.
so publishing presses are called ________ while music publishers are called labels. i'd like to stick with imprint, all that nasty artwork for a book. "this artwork best defines my texts." new texts demand new artwork, if artwork is going to be used for a text. if one is writing towards a poetics of a particular artwork, then that seems OK BUT new work needs new work. redefining?

Please forward this to friends in the Philly area.
Some of the East coast's best indie bands will be
there to raise money for the DWP. If the bands aren't
reason enough to go, supporting the DWP is, because
there's a lot of heart in the group, and they've
promoted a lot of talented artists.

The band conversed and we've decided that attendance
is MANDATORY.

I just spent all weekend in Chicago at the Dissociated
Writers Project 2004 conference and they deserve every
penny we can earn them.  These guys are bringing great
writings, music, happenings and drinking together like

no other artistic organization I have ever seen.  A
true bacchanalia founded in art, reared in enjoyment
of life.

Also, we are proud to be playing with three of the
best underground rock acts on the East coast.  Here is
a bit of info for the interested.

   a.. RELAY is fronted by Philadelphia recording icon
Jeff Zeigler whose band "spins out carefully crafted
dark pop--taut yet spacey, noisy yet melodic...all
melt together into an iridescent sheet of sonorous
reduction,
and you can still tap your foot to it."
   b.. (THE SOUNDS OF) KALEIDOSCOPE are Washington,
D.C. legends whose take on modern psychedelic rock had
been described as "a psychedelic wonderland whose
big-sound madness touches god and early Verve
simultaneously."
   c.. LAST WAVE is also from the D.C. area.  They
cite Television, Felt, Big Star and 60's psychedelia
as their influences.  They have a single on the new
Teanbeat Records compilation.

Big show.  BIG.  We need all of your support.  Those
who have been to either of our last two shows know
we've been making it worth your while...

>Incidentally, one literary source for what Kirby said might be Andre Gide.
He wrote a book (I forget which) about an older man's "love affair" with boy
in North Africa.  Of course the rapist, or at least statutory rapist in the
story was a French man, but the book did justify such behaviour in terms of
Arab culture.  I didn't buy it when I read it years ago, and I still don't
buy it.  It was rather disappointing to read such a thing from Gide, who is
one of my favorite authors (for Les Faux-Mannayeurs and Les Caves du
Vatican).  One would hope that great writers did not share the stupidity
and bigotry of the society they live in, but, alas, they do.

Millie, the Gide book was La Porte etroite (there should be an accent on the
initial 'e' of etroite but my e-mailer can't do them)

Kazim,

I think the main reason no one defended Arab males from Kirby's nastiness is
that everyone sensible deletes Kirby's messages without reading them.
Another reason might be that people (such as myself) with little first-hand
knowledge of Arab culture are not the best people to refute this kind of
thing.  I am pretty certain that Kirby is wrong, but I don't have data to
support my case.

Incidentally, one literary source for what Kirby said might be Andre Gide.
He wrote a book (I forget which) about an older man's "love affair" with boy
in North Africa.  Of course the rapist, or at least statutory rqpist in the
story was a French man, but the bookk did justify such behavior in terms of
Arab culture.  I didn't buy it when I read it years ago, and I still don't
buy it.  It was rather disappointing to read such a thing from Gide, who is
one of my favorite authors (for Les Faux-Mannayeurs and Les Caves du
Vatican).  One would hope that great writers did not share the stupidiuty
and bigotry of the society they live in, but, alas, they do.

_____An Othered South_____

At Eyedrum Art & Music Galley, Atlanta GA
On Saturday May 29th 2004
starting at 1pm and running all day

An Othered South, a series of poet and artist talks, presentations,
performances, and more.  With the recent publication of the anthology
_Another South, Experimental Writing in the South_ and it's precursor
issues of the New Orleans Review (where it was known as "An Other
South") the issue of experimental writing in the south has become one
about which those thus 'rounded up' or perhaps excluded from, have some
stake in. This event, at eyedrum, will bring together local poets,
writers and artists of varying sorts with as many out of town folks as
possible for a day long chance to meet face to face and hear each
other's thoughts and work.  Areas of specific interest are many, but
include at least, some discussion of what is going on in the south
that's distinctive, questions of who else is out there, some history of
the various scenes, groups or other poetry 'institutions' in the south.
A large and perhaps unanswerable question that looms behind this
concerns the dynamics of isolated scenes, groups and individuals and
how, they do or do not connect-- perhaps this isn't unanswerable but
something we'll all make differently?

Poets and artist already planning to attend include;
Bill Lavender
Holley Blackwell
Hank Lazar
Andy di Michele
Brad Elliot
Bob Grumman
Skip Fox
and from the atlanta poets group;
Tracey Gagne
Randy Prunty
Zac Denton
Mark Prejsnar
James Sanders
Michelle Reeves
Dana Lisa Petersen
& John Lowther

Are you an experimental writer living somewhere in the south?  Are you
someone with a stake in these questions no matter where you live?
This is not an academic conference but a gathering of artists, that is
not meant to discourage prepared text, bring your manifestos, but the
mood is not to present conclusions to any of these questions. We are
primarily coming to this space to see who we are for the 1st or 500th
time & engage in a discussion with no fixed end point.

This event is free and open to the public. Interested participants
should contact John Lowther via Lit@eyedrum.org for details about
lodging and to have any other questions answered.

Resolve
Calgary-Toronto-Calgary
--- for Malika

she woke up
and walked
right into my poem,
helped me get going,
loaded my burden
into the car, and
then disappeared
into the word.

sandwiches,
a new service
on the menu.

cloudy cover
over Valhalla blue,
sky over Saskatchewan
black flight coffee surface,
are you ready to go?  over.

eight am Calgary time
you are back in bed
under blue sheets,
asleep.  while
that song plays me
toward Toronto, let
your dreams hover
over still waters.

i can't hold the thought
of you in my head for long
without wanting to come home
and slip my hand into yours
while we sleep side by side.

snow covers the quilt, patchy
white, land worn, Manitoba.

there are no single serving specials
in supermarkets.  familial conspiracy.
the connection for our barbecue rests
between hop scotch and hodge-podge,
wanders alone north of Winnipeg.  another
neither here nor there poem descends
from the skies.  an airplane poetics.
words scattered down along the line
of the Canadian page.  i'm
reading kristeva's revp;itopm
and watching my weight.  this
is a big ticket poem! honest, i'll
order your chianti if you watch
my cell phone while i go to the washroom
to get a double americano for two.

a fast tempo curveball
piano solo, catch me
if you see me falling
from the skies.  don't
forget to recharge
your halo.  i'm adrift
on inherited metaphors,
in a raft alone at sea,
a slave on the airplane wing.
slavish banjo string constantly
twanged to a masterful song.
we're melodious.  maldoror
and a bourbon in the aisle,
or on the way to the washroom.

if it smashes down, hear
my final song resound,
amongst the pine trees
whenever the wind blows.
that's what he said!
kellogs' ham and cheesie-ohs
for breakfast lunch and dinner.
my ham and cheese crescent
was mislabeled a Volvo.  teach
me to duck properly please.

believe that i belie
a black eyed belly
and we'll call this
a leitmotif for the
duration of the poems.

metal belly.  riveted
skin, airplane belly.
let the belly belie
a belief in better lilies.
reflective belly.  what
surface is mirrored there?

i have no idea
where home is.

wicked son, it is a holiday.
call this a vacation?  goods
ain't kith and kin as much
as unclaimed articles, voices
in the overhead compartments,
uncleansed tomatoes of the word.  tuna fish,
metalbelly and goat cheese.  lyrics
to warm your gout.  deleaded
yarns spun into a western sweater
or a sheriff's badge.  zere goot!

shine your forehead
on the collective behind.

i'm amongst the uncollected
works of a billygoat's kid right
now, but if you'll kindly leave
me a message, someone will
send you a new waterpik.

there is a light that never goes out
and a place in hell for me and my friends,
your mom, maybe my fourth grad teacher.

we'll have caviar with a side of marble,
please.  and then we'll listen to the radio.
a real live recording of a salmon concert.
as bill bissett says:  the salmon talks
have resumed.  which, according to him
means at least someone is talking.

an eastern salmon arm for the taking.  you
are welcome to eat the pakora.  i
left it in the fridge for you yesterday.
and yes it was delicious.

41000 feet just going by Winnipeg.
autocorrect that, eh?
i don't care anymore if you
ideologically manipulate me,
i'm going to order whatever
i want for breakfast.  double
decker French toast with a side
of bacon maybe.  real Canadian
maple syrup to boot.

what about a protected border
between scansion and 'deep image'?

let me get you some waffles
to dry your hair and an egg
for that underarm lice. my life

in art.  your curtains
for a delicatessen.  landing
gear includes:  a carry on
bag with a laptop, a book,
my camera, and some safety
pins.  hope it doesn't freeze.

roasted walnut pieces for
your frieze.  from hell.

the pollution filled my lungs.
at least it rains here.  rains. ruins.
thundershowers, chunder throwers,
not five minute sprinkles.  the
weather keeps me on a knife.

sledge wind hammers down.

i'm having samosas.  i don't
care if your feet smell, they've
been hot since six this morning.

when i get home, we'll have
a picnic in our washroom.

i miss you, your warmth,
said the signified to the signifier.
put your arms around my trunk.

there was an ant floating in my water.
so many problems and so little lime.

stony resolve of the morning:

find good coffee somewhere along
queen street west and maybe breakfast.

that'll probably give way to tim horton's
and a muffin if i can't stop typing.

catch the mark on the fairway, find
a game it can play that offers good odds.

let the popcorn fall by the wayside, your
intention was to buy a new styx live DVD
to ease the ferry journey from here to Edmonton.

stoneage model with a butterknife, what
is it that you are trying to tell me?

i'm a nomad in your city of sense, please
could you give me a ride to Ontario Place?

i wish you could sit on the roof with me,
smoke pot and watch the rainclouds drift.

were you here, i would take your hand in
mine and we'd have some chocolate.  i

miss you even though i'm only in Toronto
for a few days.  our voices could lift

our heels and pad the soles of our feet,
ease the trip on down the road.  a toast

to the fragility of love, to our crust, repetition
against bread crumbs, well mined anyway.

this poem is now called the goodbye poem.

2. The Goodbye Poem

Carrot bran muffins south of Winnipeg,
or granola bars without propane.  3 dollars

for ham.  let me just get the keys to click
in a manner reminiscent of Spanish language
tapes, and you'll be a new record player before dawn.

not even enough room in airplane seats for a laptop.

dancers in france call this the freedom shuffle, a
language trick played outward from the middle
of American English.  call me: little passive voice.

i'm Canada in the belly of an airplane.  i'm an airplane
over the sagging middle of Canadian politics.  i'm politics
when all you really want is a Montreal smoked meat sandwich
with a garlicy dill and some dad's rootbeer to wash it down.

a seven letter word for zero tolerance.  don't even type bombs.

let's wander a letter wants down there to be amongst the people.

a democratic demonstration from the left to the right with semantics
trailing somewhere behind, lost in the glare of the sun, these words
don't swerve.  i mean the airplane doesn't. we don't have enough fuel.

steady forward the opposite direction of our railroad's railroaded past,
a squiggly line near Winnipeg.  there isn't a lake that size anywhere
around Saskatoon.  listen, if i wanted to jump ship, you'd have to yell
mutiny, then take over the poem for yourself.  rattle wind past the glass
icy water pellet resistance turbulates our hesitant climb.  the climate
for poetry in my row of seating has shifted from slight interest to feigned
tolerance.  i spelled feigned wrong there.  amount of time left varies
with regard to type of programs run.  a chess program limits battery
usage to 1 hour, while a word processor adds another half hour of life.
clear cutting the rainforest and privatizing health care, well. we can
autocorrect that into a discussion about the sustainability of ice cream.
i can't promise i won't go to the washroom again.  typing at 40 000 feet
with a nice tailwind homeward.  ghost files show up on my desktop
stretch across the line and follow the sense home to haunt the words.
Canadian shield brought to you by kellog's.  crystal angels flake
the airplane window, imagine themselves onto my eyelids, leave
impressions of their symmetrical bodies against the rocky ground below.
tonight, while i'm asleep their image will burn inside my mind, bring
the wind in and shutter my thoughts against a sad and burning insistence
that the plane has not yet touched down, hasn't landed in the poem.

will you be there when i finally arrive to warm my travel weary bones
and ease the ache in my tired muscles with your smile and kindness?

whether you are or not, the thought of you has already expanded
the narrow confines of my screen, this poem, my airplane seat.
you've already changed a trip to Calgary into a return home.

home has always been wherever i was, now it will be wherever we are.

minor turbulence over the praries, snowstorms in Toronto, 25
degrees celcisus in Calgary.  and finally, the seatbelt light clicks off.
i think i'll have some lunch, then hopefully have breakfast with you

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

At Eyedrum Art & Music Galley, Atlanta GA
On Saturday May 29th 2004
starting at 1pm and running all day

An Othered South, a series of poet and artist talks, presentations,
performances, and more.  With the recent publication of the anthology
_Another South, Experimental Writing in the South_ and it's precursor
issues of the New Orleans Review (where it was known as "An Other
South") the issue of experimental writing in the south has become one
about which those thus 'rounded up' or perhaps excluded from, have some
stake in. This event, at eyedrum, will bring together local poets,
writers and artists of varying sorts with as many out of town folks as
possible for a day long chance to meet face to face and hear each
other's thoughts and work.  Areas of specific interest are many, but
include at least, some discussion of what is going on in the south
that's distinctive, questions of who else is out there, some history of
the various scenes, groups or other poetry 'institutions' in the south.
A large and perhaps unanswerable question that looms behind this
concerns the dynamics of isolated scenes, groups and individuals and
how, they do or do not connect-- perhaps this isn't unanswerable but
something we'll all make differently?

Poets and artist already planning to attend include;
Bill Lavender
Holley Blackwell
Hank Lazar
Andy di Michele
Brad Elliot
Bob Grumman
Skip Fox
and from the atlanta poets group;
Tracey Gagne
Randy Prunty
Zac Denton
Mark Prejsnar
James Sanders
Michelle Reeves
Dana Lisa Petersen
& John Lowther

Are you an experimental writer living somewhere in the south?  Are you
someone with a stake in these questions no matter where you live?
This is not an academic conference but a gathering of artists, that is
not meant to discourage prepared text, bring your manifestos, but the
mood is not to present conclusions to any of these questions. We are
primarily coming to this space to see who we are for the 1st or 500th
time & engage in a discussion with no fixed end point.

This event is free and open to the public. Interested participants
should contact John Lowther via Lit@eyedrum.org for details about
lodging and to have any other questions answered.

In my here-to-be-in and want-forward
curling like clouds, uncertain as oracles
of weather, only the yoo-hoo, who, means
me goodbye-hullo, can say, what will

remain to say another day. That is an
another expulsion of breath, another
airhold on a further way, heigh, rhymes
with: too much, that feather weigh.

Small so, soul sow sew s'much, soles
of me feets they hurt, from tramping all
that groaned, ground, delighted to say
see you anyway. Initinsofar we are
ever to born in/ on, whatever's is that
holds, hordes, hoards

                      fragilities of identity
against the break
                 of not-to-be said-about
the space
                where we flower.


Best

I'm with you who would integrate the slayer. There hasn't been such an
examination of the social interaction between good and evil since Twin Peaks. I've
probably seen a total of twenty episodes and can already pick up on this. Comes
naturally from the extension of a cult classic.

So, um, what is back channeling? The term itself is quite lovely. Like
running water or some other vital liquid down the spine. Distillation? But I know
this is not the practical answer. Cater to my ignorance, if you would.

Hi,

i've been working on a number of writings that could be described as
having site as a collaborator, at least the conversation between site
and writing is intimate and complex. The page and the book excepted and
partially or wholly improvisational talk-based work a given, what
instances of practice between poetics and site that are accessible
through documentation in the US can those on the list point me to?

I'd be keen to read reports of work that is otherwise undocumented
also. I write with practices such as Fiona Templeton's 'Cells of
Release' and 'You: the City,' Steve Benson's 'Views of Communist
China,' Caroline Bergvall's 'Say: "parsley",' Tertia Longmire's 'the
table leaks its object,' Brian Catling's 'The Blindings,'  and works by
boundary artists such as Sophie Calle, Ian Hamilton Finlay and a
project i am collaborating on tnwk in mind.

grateful for any ensuing leads / discussion

love and love
cris

Hi Joel,

yep, got the Eldon book. Consider that more of a travelogue through
journal than quite what i was enquiring after, but interesting to
reconsider it back under that light of site.

thanks for reminding me

love and love
cris

Skanky Possum #10 offers several pleasures: new poets, at least new to me,
like Peggy Kelley's  taking aim at the decline and fall of the spectacular
commodity-economy in her poem HERE BEGINNETH THE VENERATIONS, and also
some poets I've heard for a long time:. Eileen Myles--I remember hearing
her for the first time some years ago in a Just Buffalo reading, and Chris
Stroffolino who has appeared not so long ago in FENCE.
        But of particular interest, I find, is to see poets who were
decried in the sixties as being mere renegades without talent, but who
have been going on for close to forty years, Albert Glover, Duncan
McNaughton and Diane di Prima--Remember her as coeditor of
Floating Bear (Trouble with
spelling some said.)

REMINDER

POG

presents

poets Charles Alexander & Karen Falkenstrom

Sunday, April 4, 7pm
Bookman’s
southwest corner of Speedway & Wilmot
free & open to the public

Charles Alexander, author of books of poetry that include Hopeful Buildings,
arc of light / dark matter, Pushing Water 1-6, Four Ninety Eight to Seven,
Etudes: D & D, and the just-released, from Singing Horse Press, Near or
Random Acts. Works at Chax Press (which will be 20 years old in August
2004), which he founded, making books and creating art in book form.
Partnered in life and such art with Cynthia Miller. Teaching includes short
classes and workshops at various universities around the nation, and more
frequently at the University of Arizona Poetry Center, The Learning Curve,
Naropa University, and Pima Community College.

Karen Falkenstrom has been a Tucsonan for 15 years, during which time she
earned an MFA from the UA Creative Writing program and served as
Administrative Director for the Among Other Things... literary arts series,
and, later, as Executive Director of the Tucson Poetry Festival. She joined
the UA Poetry Center staff in 1992 and, in 1993, co-founded Kore Press with
Lisa Bowden. (In 2002, a computer spell check revealed that "Kore" is just
"Korea" without an a, and since Karen is herself a "1.5 generation"
Korean/Norwegian-American, she's sort of embarrassed she hadn't noticed
before.) Currently, she serves as Marketing and Public Relations Director
for the Tucson Pima Arts Council. Her articles have appeared frequently in
the Tucson Weekly and Downtown Tucsonan, and her poems have appeared in such
literary publications as Colorado Review and Prairie Schooner and in her
writing group's 10th anniversary anthology The Daybreak & Willingness Club.
Karen also plays Irish and Japanese drums.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

About The Book:
Explore the common ground=97and the important differences=97between =20
bisexuality and transgenderism!
This book, guaranteed to provoke debate and discussion of sexuality and =20=

gender, is the first devoted exclusively to the relationship between =20
transgenderism and bisexuality. Combining the work of scholars and =20
activists, professional writers and lay people, Bisexuality and =20
Transgenderism: InterSEXions of the Others proesents ideas, thoughts, =20=

feelings, and insights from a variety of contributors who are committed =20=

to understanding=97and deepening our understanding of=97gender and =20
sexuality. You=92ll find scholarly essays, narratives, poetry, and a =20
revealing interview with four male-to-female transsexuals, two of whom =20=

are married to women who also participate in the discussion. In =20
addition, the book includes insightful chapters by well-known advocates =20=

of transgenderism, including Jamison =93James=94 Green, Coralee =
Drechsler, =20
and Matthew Kailey.

The editors of Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of the =20
Others make the provocative but crucial claim that the larger queer =20
community looks at =93B=94 and =93T=94 lives as mere =93add-ons=94 to =
=93L=94 and =93G.=94 =20
In this book they focus attention on bisexuality and =20
transgenderism=97moving the =93margins=94 to center stage and exploring =
how =20
sexuality, gender, desire, and intimacy are constructed and circulate =20=

in our society. The book=92s inclusion of voices and scholarship from =20=

Eastern cultures challenges our understanding of sexuality and gender =20=

constructions all the more, giving this collection a global scope.

Here is a sample of what Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions =20=

of the Others examines:

*       biphobia and transphobia within the United States=92 gay and =
lesbian =20
community
*       the bi/trans and subversive aspects of the works and images of =20=

cultural icons Angelina Jolie and Sandra Bernhardt
*       how bisexual and transgendered identities are socially =
constructed =20
through relationships
*       the false promise of pomosexual play=97why the concepts of =
postmodern =20
sexuality fail to rewrite the construction of gender
*       why swingers who practice bisexual and transgender behavior are =
often =20
disdained and marginalized by other GLBT people
*       suicidal thoughts and other mental health concerns of bisexual =
males =20
and females, as well as transgender people
*       Eastern perspectives on sexual/gender identities=97with =
revealing =20
chapters on gender identity in Japan and Indonesia

Reviews:

=93A VALUABLE RESOURCE for readers of all sexual orientations. . . . =20
Rich, challenging, honest, and progressive. I recommend this book to =20

be found today on the history of poetics and everyday life. If you have not
yet gotten this book, do look into it.

Pound's concerns were occupied almost wholly with transformation. The
metamorphosis of energy, forms, people, trees. The distribution of
Persephone throughout the year pressed against his psyche again and again.
It's hard to see those Mediterranean concerns through this arrid cacti and
juniper scrub. Oak and brush on limestone gather summer heat with archaic
indifference. The Steens would be a drive of several days, and present
concerns of a different scale. I'm waiting for other rhythms here now...

Dear William Carlos Williams: I read your poems tonight. June bugs pop on
the porch between mosquito bites. Here, the sensual world continues, despite
computers, autos, cell phones and airplanes. Words, too, drive through us.
Your *Kora in Hell* goes strange and powerful. What looked through you then?
Alone in your room late nights bringing your words to the page? Your earth
tenderness took root in the freed composition of song.



37

Whitman too pushed through these things. The white death of our social urges
keep us drifting. Rotating green clouds loom on some foreboding sky. Tangle
of branches and thorns pull you in, poison ivy staining your arm there in
the bleached topsoil. We live here between sun and moon, under sky and star,
of the earth disappointed or driven by weather. Machines rage, a by-product
of Western alchemy, but you understood language resembled our first forms.

You can gather these things everyone knows. You absorb experience--the deep
past, every atom of the present. You do what you know before you know what
to do. Glut of sensation beats the heart. We eat our pistachio and mint
double scoops from a waffle cone.

New Demand Drives Canada&#146;s Baby Seal Hunt

April 5, 2004
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS





CAP-AUX-MEULES, Quebec, March 30 - Commercial hunting of
baby seals is back and even bigger than when it stirred a
global outcry two decades ago.

Horrified by the clubbing of infant harp seals, animal
rights advocates swayed public opinion against the hunt.
Environmentalists joined the campaign, fearing that the
species was being depleted. World sales collapsed. Even
Canada reacted with revulsion and began stiffening
regulations on the kill.

Now, Canada has lifted the quota to a rate unheard of in a
half century, buoyed by new markets in Russia and Poland,
and changing environmental calculations. A recovering
market has turned into a quiet boom.

Here on ice patches of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the hunt
looks nearly as brutal as ever. For as far as the eye can
see, dozens of burly men bearing clubs roam the ice in
snowmobiles and spiked boots in search of silvery young
harp seals. With one or two blows to the head, they crush
the skulls, sometimes leaving the young animals in
convulsions. The men drag the bodies to waiting fishing
vessels or skin them on the spot, leaving a crisscross of
bloody trails on the slowly melting ice.

On the trawler Manon Yvon, one hunter, Jocelyn Theriault,
35, said, "My father hunted for 45 years, so I was born
with the seal." His colleagues utter a sarcastic "welcome
aboard" as they throw the skins on their 65-foot boat. "We
do it for the money," Mr. Theriault said, "but it's also a
tradition in our blood."

Animal rights advocates aroused the world in the 1970's and
1980's with grim films of Canadian seal hunters clubbing
white-coated seal pups not yet weaned from their mother's
milk and then skinning some alive. That campaign - complete
with photographs of Brigitte Bardot snuggling an infant
seal - succeeded in shutting down American and European
markets and forcing a virtual collapse of the hunt.

But over the last six years, Canada's seal hunt, by far the
world's largest and commercially most valuable, has
undergone a gradual revival that has virtually escaped
world attention. That trend is making an extraordinary jump
this year, when the federal government will allow the
killing of up to 350,000 baby harp seals, or more than one
in three of all those born, largely for their valuable fur.


That is an increase of more than 100,000 from recent years,
and the largest number hunted in at least a half century.

Rising prices for the skins and contentions that the
growing seal population is contributing to a shrinking
codfish population have eased the revival of an industry
once roundly seen as barbaric. Meanwhile, tougher hunting
rules, including stiffer regulations to avert skinning the
seals alive, have muted the effort to stop the hunt and
eased the consciences of Canadians.

"This slaughter that everyone thinks has disappeared is
back with a vengeance," said Rebecca Aldworth, an antihunt
advocate with the International Fund for Animal Welfare.

A majority of the seals killed are under a month old, she
said, and, "at that age, the seals haven't eaten their
first solid foods and have not learned to swim so they have
no escape from the hunters."

The seal hunt never completely shut down. After the United
States banned the importation of all seal products in 1972
and the European Union banned the importation of the white
pelts of the youngest pups in 1983, killings fell to as low
as 15,000 harp seals in 1985, mostly for meat and local
handicrafts.

Embarrassed by all the publicity accusing Canada of
inhumane treatment of animals, the government banned
killing whitecoats - the youngest pups up to 12 days old.
Now only the seals who have shed their white coats and
become "beaters," at about three weeks old, are killed in
these waters for their black-spotted silvery fur. The
killing of those young seals has so far raised fewer
hackles, although critics say hunting methods have not been
substantially changed.

The surprising rebound of the hunt off the =CEles de la
Madeleine and the northern coast of Newfoundland, where the
harp seals migrate south from the Arctic every spring to
give birth and then mate again, results in large part from
a robust revival in the price of sealskin.

Seal products remain banned in the United States, and they
find only limited acceptance in most of Western Europe. But
new markets have emerged in Russia, Ukraine and Poland,
with a fashion trend for sealskin hats and accessories. Fur
experts expect the Chinese market to grow, perhaps raising
prices higher.

"Markets are good, acceptance is growing and prices are
well up," said Tina Fagen, executive director of the
Canadian Sealers Association. She said the price for a
top-grade harp sealskin had more than doubled since 2001,
to about $42, approaching the prices of the early 1970's.

But the revival is also made possible by a Canadian seal
population that was replenished during the long hunting
slump. The Canadian harp seal population has tripled in
size since 1970, according to the Department of Fisheries
and Oceans, to more than five million today.

Fishermen contend that the abundance of seals is hindering
a revival of shrinking cod stocks since each adult seal
eats an estimated ton of sea life annually. The fishermen
get support from politicians who want to help revive
economically depressed regions of Canada, and some
scientists say their position is reasonable.

Animal rights advocates are revving up a campaign against
the hunt, reviving calls for a tourism boycott of Canada
and flying journalists over the ice fields to photograph
hunters killing the seals. The New York Times did not take
part in any of those flights.

A new generation of celebrities has taken up the cause,
including Paris Hilton, Christina Applegate and Nick Carter
of the Backstreet Boys pop group. At the last Sundance Film
Festival, some people wore a new T-shirt that said, "Club
sandwiches, not seals."

But so far the outrage has not echoed the way it once did,
in part because Canada outlawed the killing of the youngest
pups to follow Western European import guidelines and
stiffened rules and enforcement to ensure that seals are
killed quickly and not skinned alive. The government
requires novice seal hunters to obtain an assistant's
license and train under the supervision of veterans for two
years before qualifying for a professional license.

The government this year added a requirement that hunters
thoroughly examine the skull of the seal or touch the eyes
of animal to test for reflexes to guarantee a seal is brain
dead before skinning.

"The industry needed to be cleaned up and it was, though
perceptions persist," said Roger Simon, the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans area director for the =CEles de la
Madeleine.

Some prominent environmental groups that opposed the hunt
in years past because of concerns over the sustainability
of the Canadian harp seal population have dropped their
active opposition. Greenpeace, once one of the most active
groups against the hunt, now says it is satisfied that
Canada is not allowing infant whitecoat seals to be killed.


But Mads Christensen, a Greenpeace seals expert, said he
was concerned about this year's large hunt. "We don't have
enough science, and that calls for caution," he added.

Canadian officials say they will regularly review the seal
population and adjust the hunt accordingly. "If you are
going to have an annual harvest you have to maintain a
sustainable number," said Geoff Regan, the minister of
fisheries and oceans, in an interview. "We are going to
come up with these numbers on the basis of what the herd
can sustain."

Seal hunting is worth about $30 million annually to the
Newfoundland economy, which has been hurt by the collapse
of the cod fishery. About 5,000 hunters and 350 workers who
process skins rely on the industry. Hundreds more hunting
jobs are created in Quebec and Nova Scotia.

"I love it that the market is back," said Jason Spence, the
32-year-old captain of Ryan's Pride, a fishing boat that
set sail from Newfoundland a few weeks ago for the seal
hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Arguing that hunting seals is no worse than "people taking
the heads off chickens, butchering cows and butchering
pigs," he added, "People are just trying to make a living."

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, April 9, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.
Rae Armantrout & Kaia Sand

Rae Armantrout joins us on the occasion of the publication of her latest
collection, Up to Speed (Wesleyan, 2004), of which Susan Howe writes: "The
poems?are edgy, idiosyncratic, tough and tender.  Marianne Moore, in her
wonderful essay ?Anna Pavlova,? speaks of the ballerina's high arches and
?toes of steel? as having made her ?pizzicati on tiptoe? and steadily held
pauses possible.  I can't think of a more perfect way to describe Up to
Speed."

Kaia Sand?s debut collection, Interval, has just appeared from Edge Books.
Carolyn Forche calls her "a necessary poet, and bracingly new" and Heather
Fuller urges us to "read this book for its evocation of the sublime in the
face of the populace's raw complacency telescoped and interpreted."  Born in
Alaska and raised in Oregon, Sand currently lives outside of DC, curates the
In Your Ear poetry series at the District of Columbia Arts Center and co-edits
The Tangent.

Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT members,
and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall

Dear Listmembers who spoke about Edmond Jabes. I went out and ordered The
Book Of Questions (which includes the three volumbes, The Book of Questions,
The Book of Yukel, and Return to the Book) and I am loving every second of
it. I find myself awestruck and blown away sentence by sentence.

I am seeing many many connections between the Zohar and this work. I'm
particularly obsessed right now abaout chapter six where he opens with "Our
ties to beings and things are so fragile they often brak without us
noticing" (is that related to the idea of the shomer who watches over the
dead before they are buried -- the mystical happenings that can occur when
not seen? not noticed? -- and then he goes on to this dialogue between
rabbis about names (and then the numericol count etc..)

The Rabbis that he quotes -- are they fictional? autobiographical? Does
anyone know?

Maureen:

I can't answer your questions about the Zohar, but I do know that the rabbis
are fictional, which makes it all the more interesting.

**************************************************************

-Denial of Marriage Rights Costs Massachusetts Couples Thousands of=20
Dollars Per Year, Report Finds

-Disparities in Wide Range of Areas Including Income Tax, Survivor=20
Benefits, and Estate Taxes


BOSTON, April 5, 2004 - As millions of married couples are signing and=20=

sending off their tax returns prior to the April 15 tax day deadline, a=20=

groundbreaking report released today by the National Gay and Lesbian=20
Task Force Policy Institute reveals that same-sex couples face=20
widespread economic disparities and hardships because they are denied=20
equal marriage rights. The report takes situations commonly faced by=20
Massachusetts couples and compares the economic benefits afforded to=20
married couples to those available to same-sex couples. Two same-sex=20
couples residing in Massachusetts are profiled to show the real-life=20
costs to them and their children of not being able to marry.


Entitled "Economic Benefits of Marriage under Federal and Massachusetts=20=

Law," the study is the first comprehensive analysis of the disparities=20=

gay couples face in federal and state income tax, Social Security=20
benefits, gift tax, estate tax, worker's compensation, and line of duty=20=

death benefits. It was authored by Terence R. Dougherty, an attorney=20
with Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler LLP. It is the first of five=20
economic studies to be produced by the Task Force Policy Institute=20
analyzing states that are at the epicenter of the national dialogue=20
concerning equal marriage rights for same-sex couples.

"Same-sex couples pay more in taxes and get fewer protections and=20
benefits in return," said Matt Foreman, the Task Force's executive=20
director. "These injustices aren't hypothetical - instead, they are=20
being inflicted right now on hard-working, tax paying Massachusetts=20
couples, often at times of family tragedy and loss. This report=20
quantifies the cost to two Massachusetts gay and lesbian families."

"We're going to use these hard data to convince our state legislators=20
not only that the economic impact of denying gay and lesbian couples=20
equal marriage rights is real, but that civil unions are no substitute=20=

for full equality," said Sue Hyde, a Cambridge parent and the Task=20
Force's New England field organizer. Hyde noted that information from=20
the report will be used to educate members of the Massachusetts=20
legislature during the coming year as part of a comprehensive effort to=20=

kill a proposed amendment to the state constitution prohibiting=20
same-sex marriages. (The legislature approved the measure by a five=20
vote margin on March 29, but it needs to be approved by the legislature=20=

again in 2005 before it is placed on the ballot in 2006).

One of the couples profiled in the report, Donna Triggs and Donna=20
Moore, both 54, pay $2,177 (13%) more each year in state and federal=20
income taxes than a married couple earning the same amount because they=20=

cannot file a joint return. The analysis also finds that if Ms. Triggs=20=

died as a result of an injury at work, her spouse would receive $884=20
per week ($45,968 per year, up to a maximum of $207,722) in workers'=20
compensation benefits. Because Ms. Triggs and Ms. Moore cannot now=20
marry, however, Ms. Moore would receive zero workers' compensation=20
benefits.

"Why should we have to pay more in taxes while being cut out of the=20
social safety net programs we've been paying into our entire lives,"=20
asked Hyde. "As Massachusetts residents, all we want and what we=20
deserve is equal treatment."

Another couple profiled in the report is Thorsten Behrens and=20
Christopher Schiebel, who are raising Christopher's two children from a=20=

previous marriage. Thorsten is the main breadwinner, and Christopher=20
earns significantly less than Thorsten. If Thorsten died after the two=20=

were allowed to legally marry, Christopher's Social Security benefit=20
would be $1,533 per month ($18,396 per year). Because they cannot=20
marry, however, Christopher's Social Security benefit would be only=20
$303 per month ($3,636 per year), a disparity of $1,230 per month=20
($14,760 per year). Likewise, upon retirement, Thorsten and=20
Christopher's combined monthly Social Security retirement benefit would=20=

be 25% higher ($461 more per month, $5,532 more per year) if they were=20=

legally married.

The report underscores that creating civil unions for same-sex couples,=20=

which is being advocated by the leadership of the Massachusetts=20
legislature, falls far short of providing benefits equal to those=20
enjoyed by married couples.

"Because so many important financial rights and responsibilities - like=20=

federal income tax and Social Security benefits - are federal=20
protections based on marital status, civil unions do not and cannot=20
provide anything remotely resembling what comes with marriage," said=20
Sean Cahill, Ph.D., director of the Task Force Policy Institute. "There=20=

are 1,138 federal protections associated with marriage, but civil=20
unions will not give gay couples access to a single one."

Given the passage of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in=20
1996, which allows the federal government to withhold recognition from=20=

same-sex marriages performed in any state, in the short run same-sex=20
marriages in Massachusetts will not be recognized by federal=20
bureaucracies. However, many believe DOMA to be unconstitutional, and=20
it is possible that in the future DOMA will be struck down or repealed.=20=

It is also possible that a President and Congress more supportive of=20
equal rights for gay and lesbian people will afford these federal=20
protections to married same-sex couples. "While married gay couples in=20=

Massachusetts may not be able to immediately access those federal=20
protections," Cahill said, "if they are allowed to marry they have the=20=

potential to access these protections in the future. However, if=20
same-sex couples are only allowed to form civil unions, under the=20
current legal framework they will not be able to access any federal=20
benefits or protections."

The report was authored by Terence R. Dougherty, an attorney with=20
Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler LLP, a prestigious 168-lawyer firm=20
based in New York City. The firm was ranked #1 in the nation for the=20
pro bono contributions of lawyers in 2002.

A poetry governed by restrictive choice,
seasonal growths, and energy placed mainly
at the disposal of recovery. And, it seems --
as perhaps it must -- his recovery moves
continuosly towards the existential by being
dehistoricized into these recent pastoral
implements. Sets me wondering: Are there
are other poetries of recovery that do not
follow this path?

Franz Wright (http://www.webdelsol.com/Perihelion/wright.htm)

 Old Story
First the telephone went,
then
the electricity.
It was cold,
and they both went to sleep
as though dressed for a journey.
Like addictions condoned
from above evening
fell, lost
leaves waiting
to come back as leaves--
the long snowy divorce. . .
That narrow bed, a cross
between an altar
and an operating table. Voice
saying, While I was alive
I loved you.
And I love you now.


_______________________________________________________________Reunion

Snow over the scarred fields just ending, between clouds
a candle in a horse skull
moon
at dawn--
My sin is always before me.
In the end the price of understanding
everything will be, of
its communication
to those who stand around you,
the complete and absolute
impossibility,
but
does this mean
I won't remember
Earth? Perhaps
it does, but
I don't know.
Soon I will find out.
                             Snow over
the scarred fields
just ending,
what lies
before me is my past.
That is,
should I father a fatherless child.


_______________________________________________________________To John
Wieners: Elegy & Response

The street outside
the window says
I don't miss you, and I don't wish you well
Says crocuses
coaxed out of hiding
and killed in the snow
Says six o'clock and a billion black birds
wheeling, and the dusk stars
wait, and the avalanche waits--
And have you looked at the paper today
Medical research discloses
that everyone is going to die
of something
Ulterior avenues, I will not take you
Supernaturally articulate pencil, where the heaven
of lost objects are you
Beginning summer now, incredibly close
clouds like an illustration
that disturbed you as a child
Appalling and incomprehensible mercy--
The seeing see only this world.

_______________________________________________________________Domesticity

Gray little clumps weightless as hair dust what is it
Forty years later
utterly unrecognizable
save for our eyes
that is, were we to meet--

_______________________________________________________________Auto-Lullaby

Think of a sheep
knitting a sweater;
think of your life
getting better & better.
Think of your cat
asleep in a tree;
think of that spot
where you once skinned your knee.
Think of a bird
which stands in your palm;
try to remember
the 21st Psalm.
Think of a big pink horse
galloping south;
think of a fly, and
close your mouth.
If you feel thirsty, then
drink from your cup.
The birds will keep singing
until they wake up.







They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Aldon:

This book is really a work of love.
 However, I found it too much Rosemarie and too little Edmund.
 Just my humble opinion.

Anyone care to title it? I'm always up for collaborative work:


how this city reminds me
it is no longer

mine

how its landmarks iamb & dactyl
each symbol signals another place

a veritable so-to-speak
                  overshadows this
city, it is no longer

a streetmap
its roads follow a doe-see-doe

where does this sentence say where to go?

it is a sidewalk winds through avenues
not shoreline where one shouldly go

small is a sound
descending, it is concrete
which enlarges footfall

into habit       into music       into pedestrian

which makes an hour minutes—
sun’s past five & dime, it is time

which makes us
late, to enter another city
past five is to invite aporia

shadows remind me it is time
to go, ink moreso

how this penmanship becomes
pluvial

Not as receptive to it, and left
wondering if more is being done
elsewhere. Did like the music of it
though.

With no harm met to the poet or the poetry, the title does have a seasonal
Eastery 'walk on the water' presumption - I mean if you don't have your
wings - and even that's 'Kennedy problematic' (bad!), how do you get to
Martha's Vineyard without taking the ferry?

so my girl had an aweful stomach ache, she wasn't digesting her food properly, and asked me "do you have any acidic juice?"

i answered, "no, baby, i only have orthodox juice."

this is true.

and my buddy doug harmer, film maker extraordinaire said "I don't eat pork." And Lilly answered, "But yr not a Jew." "You're right," he said, "I'm a paradox Jew."

this is also true. and I am a practicing Catholic.

Happy Holy Week!

Potes & Poet's Press proudly announces the publication of The Natural
History of Trees by John Perlman. A harmonic uprising of botany, history and
poetry, The Natural History Trees arises directly from the springs of
delight:

"Perlman's forest of 'consciousness conscious' begins at the edge of the
20th century wasteland and leads into a wilderness where history moves
vertically, straight or fractured, leafy or bare, toward an ever-impossible
sky. Take a walk with him in this 'palindrome of pilgrimage utter
coincidence lost & found"-- he's our new Thoreau/Beston/Muir and he's going
to teach us how 'to get out of the world alive.'"

Napalm and nuclear bombs for every insult
Every prick of the thorn crown

Lays about him burning and smashing
Murdering the Sea

    Money to invest in it from the beginning

Curious elision for all who did not...

from Scenes of Life at the Capital by Philip Whalen, 1969.

It was not so curious to hear George Bush invoke "The Almighty" (aka Christ,
one assumes) in again declaring his commitment this morning to bring
democracy to Iraq - flaming guns an all.
Given events these last few days in Iraq - I would say somebody's "Christ"
is in big trouble and there are going to be a lot of bills on all levels to
pay here.

who is this guy who won? His review in the Times sounds like he is another
hyperconfessional guy who writes about loss? YUK
when is Robert Creeley, or Charles Bernstein, or Rachel Blau DuPlessis or
some poet 'other' type of poet going to win this thing?

I haven't read Walking to Martha's Vineyard, but have read Franz Wright's The
Beforelife and Entry in an Unknown Hand, both of which I enjoyed immensely.
Yeah, confession, yeah, drama, yeah, recovery. Usually, blech, but done well in
his case. It's his reversals that do it, where he denies the confession,
denies the drama, and denies the recovery. They give the poems spin, and make them
wonderfully depressing in a daily survivalist sort of way. And I don't think
I need to tell anyone how a New York Times review can make even the best work
sound like an uninventive pile of poo.

peace out,

The only thing I've read of Franz Wright's are his translations of Rilke
(The Unknown Rilke).  I thought them very fine indeed, among the best I've
read, and certainly vastly superior to Stephen Mitchell's wordy paraphrases.
I imagine that mind would produce something more intelligent than soggy
"confessional".

How do we define confessional, specifically? Is it putting yourself in the poem?

Dactyl Foundation for the Arts & Humanities
celebrates the release of

A New Theory for American Poetry:

Democracy, the Environment, and the Future of Imagination
(Harvard University Press)

by Angus Fletcher

Thursday, April 15, 2004
wine and hors d'oeuvres 6:45 p.m.
lecture presentation 7 p.m.
suggested donation $8

Drawing on the complexity sciences, Fletcher argues that the "best" American
poetry -- Whitman's "end product and influence of the globe" -- poetically
realizes our overwhelming sense of environmental contact and coherence in
part by approximating the lost grammatical technique of the middle voice,
intermingling object and subject, active and passive verbs.

Reviews of New Theory

"Fletcher argues [the best American poetry] is not a vehicle for the
presentation of the self but mines the process by which the self develops as
it negotiates and becomes immersed in the multitudes around it. a
provocative vision of how poets continue to be the unacknowledged
legislators of the world, how their work . . . can embody and change our
consciousness." Robert Faggen

".the crown of [Fletcher's] career: bold, original, brimming with
imaginative energy on every page." Harold Bloom

"Fletcher restores the imagination, the aesthetic, the emotions and the
natural world to critical discourse, while at the same time attending to
some of the most significant developments in scientific thinking, notably
ecology and chaos theory." Jonathan Bate

"Fletcher has climbed to the top of the mast and found there, revealed at
last, the curvature of the world." Susan Stewart

"I read this great theorist and discover again, again and anew, answers to
our students' tormented questions: what is the good, the value, the use of
poetry?" Richard Howard

"Fletcher defines a poetics for the twenty-first century by means of a very
original collection of Clare, Whitman, and Ashbery as Environmental Poets. "
Helen Vendler

".one of the most important books about poetic imagination of the past
half-century. " John Hollander

"elsewhere are foggy pasts...

I said, not something I wrote...
after this announcement,
Virginia expected my readers
would be sure to call her
Ms. Astraea Marie Aerigone;
and, indeed, they were quite
willing to please her, whenever
they could remember the name.


after that stanza I pulled off
the cloth covering Wormswork's
face, and saw, as I expected,
the cruel countenance of
Abd el Barak. Virginia (née Ms.
Astraea Marie Aerigone) only
seemed to grow worse. this has
been another vulgar performance
on the death of Virginia, and is
dedicated to Antoinette Manuel.

ML Rosenthal (who some say coined the term), in his 1967 book _The New
Poets: American and British Poetry Since WWII_, remarks that, whoever coined
the term, its use quickly got out of hand, as did bad imitators of Lowell
and company. Rosenthal argues that in Life Studies Lowell achieved Pound's
goal

       To have gathered from the air a live tradition
or from a fine old eye the unconquered flame
This is not vanity.
       Here error is all in the not done,
all in the difference that faltered.

In regards to confessionalism, didn't Lowell essentially say himself that it
was in the air, and that he just paid attention (to Snodgrass, to Ginsberg)
and put it to work? But if confession in poetry was a swing away from colder
aesthetics of the poetry establishment in the 30s and 40s, then it was also
for Lowell a dramatic swing away from everything he'd done theretofore.

Apparently, for Rosenthal, having brought "private humiliations, sufferings,
and psychological problems" into the poems was enough to suggest the term.
In New Poets he adds the qualification that there is a sense of
victimization in the Confessional poem and that the Confessional line is
really the logical extension of that element of Romanticism that is all
about mythologizing the Self.

We always talk about Lowell as the most influential Confessionalist, but it
seems to me that the Confessional and post-confessional lines from the 70s
through today have been most influenced by Sexton's drama and violence
(directed both at self and other). Doesn't it also seem that much
Confessional poetry seems to come from a need for absolution and, because
that neediness sits heavily at the center of the poem, attempts to suck the
reader down into a whirlpool of pity? No wonder so many have reacted so
vehemently against it.

As many here will already know, Rosenthal also counted Ginsberg among his
Confessionals.

Rosenthal also argues that it's Lowell's impersonal motivations for making
poems (see his first couple of books) that save his confessionalism from the
sap pit. Not sure I buy it, but it's a book worth checking out. Seems
strangely current. Also an interesting section on "The Projectivist
Moment"--interesting because Rosenthal fawns all over Creeley but can't seem
to make anything of Olson. I wonder if his reading of Olson evolved over the
years?

There's also an anthology called _After Confession_ edited by Kate Sontag
and David Graham. Good essays trying on ideas about working with, through,
around, in spite of, against, etc. the lyric I. I wish it had a few more
folks from outside the mainstream, though.

What, indeed, do we mean by confessional? What exactly is it that those of
us who disdain the confessional want to avoid?

Best,
Brian

Are we keeping Jabes alive? I'm still up for an aphorism or two (and the ambiguities just astound me):

Writing is a Form of Questioning.
For Jabès, it is Necessary to Hammer in the Glue.
His Name is not only Unpronounceable, it is Illegible.

Illegibility is Pronounced, for a Moment, Irreducibility.
Writing Inflicts its Impossibility upon the Reading Act.
His Name is not only a Sound, it is a Wound.

The Sound Produced by the Wound: the Word.
Writing is to Form the Question, and Question at the Same Time.
His Name is the Articulation of Space, and at the Same Time, its Destruction.

Articulation is Pronounced, for a Second Time, Appropriation.
If a Text can Resist the Question, it can Resist any Reading.
His Name is the Reduction of Space, Keeping Time with its Surroundings.

In Fact, the Question is no Longer Relevant.
A Text Remains Intact, though Godriddled.
His Name Becomes Equivocal and Univocal.

My experience in college was an aversion to confessionalism from students and some professors as anything personal, non-intellectual, or without irony. I guess it's a reaction to the confessionalists in a way, but it also seemed tied up in a need to sound smart -- or maybe, ultra-omniscient?

it seems to me that most poetry is by nature confessional. Those who wish to
be anti-confessional or whatever have but to find a way to omit the I. Instead
of "i feel" say "jack feels" and ba-ba-boom instant not confessional poetry.
but feel free to still use those confessions from your life that make it worth
the time. As long as they are framed around not you.

I guess i understand the backlash. I guess i understand not wanting to read
someone's whining complaint. but I think there became a confusion between the
confession and the complaint. just as there became a confusion between the
differentiation and the dissociation of art and spirit.

peace,

=A0
Teapots and Kettles...
Now it seems we are almost literally reliving the first few days of
occupation=8A I woke up to the sound of explosions and gunfire last night and
for one terrible moment I thought someone had warped me back a whole year
and we would have to relive this last year of our life over and over again=8A
We haven't sent the kids to school for 3 days. The atmosphere is charged an=
d
the day before yesterday, Baghdad was quiet and empty, almost=8A the calm
before the storm. The area of A'adhamiya in Baghdad is seeing street
fighting: the resistance and Americans are fighting out in the streets and
Al-Sadr city was bombed by the troops. They say that dozens were killed and
others wounded. They're bringing them in to hospitals in the center of the
city.
Falloojeh has been cut off from the rest of Iraq for the last three days.
It's terrible. They've been bombing it constantly and there are dozens dead=
.
Yesterday they said that the only functioning hospital in the city was hit
by the Americans and there's no where to take the wounded except a meager
clinic that can hold up to 10 patients at a time. There are over a hundred
wounded and dying and there's nowhere to bury the dead because the American=
s
control the area surrounding the only graveyard in Falloojeh; the bodies ar=
e
beginning to decompose in the April heat. The troops won't let anyone out o=
f
Falloojeh and they won't let anyone into it either- the people are going to
go hungry in a matter of days because most of the fresh produce is brought
from outside of the city. We've been trying to call a friend who lives ther=
e
for three days and we can't contact him.
This is supposed to be 'retaliation' for what happened last week with the
American contractors- if they were indeed contractors. Whoever they were, i=
t
was gruesome and wrong=8A I feel for their families. Was I surprised? Hardly.
This is an occupation and for those of you na=EFve enough to actually believe
Chalabi and the Bush administration when they said the troops were going to
be 'greeted with flowers and candy' then I can only wish that God will, in
the future, grant you wisdom.
This is crazy. This is supposed to be punishment for violence but it's only
going to result in more bloodshed on both sides=8A people are outraged
everywhere- Sunnis and Shi'a alike. This constant bombing is only going to
make things worse for everyone. Why do Americans think that people in
Baghdad or the south or north aren=B9t going care what happens in Falloojeh o=
r
Ramadi or Nassriyah or Najaf? Would Americans in New York disregard bombing
and killing in California?
And now Muqtada Al-Sadr's people are also fighting it out in parts of
Baghdad and the south. If the situation weren't so frightening, it would
almost be amusing to see Al-Hakeem and Bahr Ul Iloom describe Al-Sadr as an
'extremist' and a 'threat'. Muqtada Al-Sadr is no better and no worse than
several extremists we have sitting on the Governing Council. He's just as
willing to ingratiate himself to Bremer as Al-Hakeem and Bahr Ul Iloom. The
only difference is that he wasn't given the opportunity, so now he's a
revolutionary. Apparently, someone didn't give Bremer the memo about how
when you pander to one extremist, you have to pander to them all. Hearing
Abdul Aziz Al-Hakeem and Bahr Ul Iloom claim that Al-Sadr is a threat to
security and stability brings about visions of the teapot and the kettle=8A
Then Bremer makes an appearance on tv and says that armed militias will
*not* be a part of the New Iraq=8A where has that declaration been the last 1=
2
months while Badir's Brigade has been wreaking havoc all over the country?
Why not just solve the problem of Al-Sadr's armed militia by having them
join the police force and army, like the Bayshmarga and Badir's Brigade?!
Al-Sadr's militia is old news. No one was bothering them while they were
terrorizing civilians in the south. They wore badges, carried Klashnikovs
and roamed the streets freely=8A now that they've become a threat to the
'Coalition', they suddenly become 'terrorists' and 'agitators'.
Now there=B9s an arrest warrant with his name on it, although the Minister of
Justice was on tv claiming he knew nothing about the arrest warrant, etc. H=
e
basically said that he was washing his hands of any move against Muqtada
Al-Sadr. Don=B9t get me wrong- I=B9d love to see Muqtada behind bars, but it
will only cause more chaos and rage. It=B9s much too late for that... he has
been cultivating support for too long. It=B9s like a contest now between the
prominent Shi=B9a clerics. The people are dissatisfied- especially in the
south. The clerics who weren=B9t given due consideration and a position on th=
e
Governing Council, are now looking for influence and support through the
people. You can either be a good little cleric and get along with Bremer
(but have a lot of dissatisfied people *not* supporting you) or you can be =
a
firebrand cleric and rally the masses...
It's like the first few days of occupation again=8A it's a nightmare and
everyone is tense. My cousin and his family are staying with us for a few
days because his wife hates to be alone at home with the kids. It's a relie=
f
to have them with us. We all sit glued to the television- flipping between
Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabia, CNN, BBC and LBC, trying to figure out what is going
on. The foreign news channels are hardly showing anything. They punctuate
dazzling reportages on football games and family pets with a couple of
minutes worth of footage from Iraq showing the same faces running around in
a frenzy of bombing and gunfire and then talk about 'Al-Sadr the firebrand
cleric', not mentioning the attacks by the troops in Ramadi, Falloojeh,
Nassriyah, Baghdad, Koufa, etc.
Over the last three days, over 150 Iraqis have been killed by troops all
over Iraq and it's maddening. At times I feel like a caged animal- there's
so much frustration and anger. The only people still raving about
'liberation' are the Iraqis affiliated with the Governing Council and the
Puppets, and even they are getting impatient with the mess.
Our foreign minister Hoshyar Zibari was being interviewed by some British
journalist yesterday, making excuses for Tony Blair and commending him on
the war. At one point someone asked him about the current situation in Iraq=
.
He mumbled something about how there were 'problems' but it wasn't a big
deal because Iraq was 'stable'=8A what Iraq is he living in?
And as I blog this, all the mosques, Sunni and Shi=B9a alike, are calling for
Jihad...

Originally from San Diego (with some years living in San Francisco),

"We always talk about Lowell as the most influential
Confessionalist, but it seems to me that the
Confessional and post-confessional lines from the
70s through today have been most influenced by
Sexton's drama and violence (directed both at self and
other)."

Yes, but the line of influence generally goes back to
Lowell, as Sexton was Lowell's student in 1957, when
Lowell was drafting Life Studies (1959), right?

"Confessional" seems to me to be pretty much a meaningless term, whether
used as an adjective of opprobrium or worn as a badge of honor by its
apologists. When I hear it used in its former capacity, it rankles me in the
same way the phrase "so-called language writing" does. It's a kind of
dismissive shorthand that people use to label something they don't want to
pay close attention to.

That's not to say that there aren't a whole lot of forgettable personal
autobiographical lyrics out there masquerading as poems.  Nor is it to deny
that one groups poets and aesthsetics into convenient groups for the sake of
discussion.  But I really think, and I know many who agree with me, that the
label "confessional" has worn out its welcome.  It really describes very
little.

People often pick up a book in the hopes of being transported to another
world, seeking to encounter something new.  Sin puertas visibles: An
Anthology of Contemporary Poetry by Mexican Women fulfills that promise.
This fully bilingual collection features the electrifying work of eleven
poets, none of which has been translated into English before. Edited and
translated by California poet Jen Hofer, Sin puertas visibles (no
visible doors) opens passageways to a poetry of passion and meditation,
perception and sensuous detail, and provides readers with a window
through which to view some of the most fascinating writing being
produced by emerging Mexican women writers.



Dolores Dorantes was born in Córdoba, Veracruz in 1973. Her most recent
books include SexoPUROsexoVELOZ (Cuadernos del filodecaballo, 2002),
Para Bernardo: un eco (MUB editoraz, 2000) and Poemas para niños
(Ediciones El Tucán de Virginia, 1999). She is a founding editor of
Editorial Frugal, which counts among its activities publication of the
monthly broadside series Hoja Frugal, printed in editions of 4000 and
distributed free throughout Mexico. Translations of her poems into
English have been published in the anthology Sin puertas visibles
(ed.and trans. Jen Hofer, University of Pittsburgh and Ediciones Sin
Nombre, 2003), in issue #3 of Aufgabe, and in kenning. Translations of
her new work will be published as a chapbook by Seeing Eye Books in
2004. She lives in Ciudad Juárez, where she works as a freelance writer
and editor.



Mónica Nepote was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco in 1970. Her books and
chapbooks include Islario (Cuadernos de filodecaballos, Guadalajara:
2001) and Trazos de noche herida (Fondo Editorial Tierra Adentro,
CONACULTA, México, D.F.: 1993). She has published poetry, essays,
chronicles and literary criticism in many newspapers and magazines in
Mexico City, including El Ángel, Biblioteca de México, La Jornada
Semanal, Nexos, and Sábado. Translations of her poems into English have
been published in the magazine Rhizome, in the online version of
Exquisite Corpse (http://www.corpse.org/issue_3), and in the journal
Bitter Oleander, as well as in the anthology Sin puertas visibles (ed.
and trans. Jen Hofer, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2003). She lives
in Mexico City, where she teaches poetry workshops and works as a
freelance writer and art critic.



Jen Hofer edited and translated Sin puertas visibles: An Anthology of
Contemporary Poetry by Mexican Women (University of Pittsburgh Press and
Ediciones Sin Nombre, 2003). Her recent books of poetry include the
chapbook lawless (Seeing Eye Books, 2003), slide rule (subpress, 2002),
and The 3:15 Experiment (with Lee Ann Brown, Danika Dinsmore, and
Bernadette Mayer, The Owl Press, 2001). She is co-editor, with Rod
Smith, of Aerial #10, a forthcoming critical volume on the work of the
poet Lyn Hejinian. Her writings against the war in Iraq and the war on
terror can be found in the special anti-war issue of A.BACUS, and in the
anthology Enough (O Books, 2003); other poems, prose texts and
translations appear in recent issues of 26, Aufgabe, Conundrum, kenning,
kiosk, NO: A Magazine of the Arts, and in the book Surface Tension: The
Problematics of Site (Errant Bodies Press, 2003). She lives in Los
Angeles, where she teaches and translates.

Hi Everyone. This is a proper announcement concerning our Zine Series. I never fully elaborated my intentions last week when I put together the project.

First off: What is Furniture Press?

The press was established in response to Mediocre literature that was being published in the local (University) Literary Publication GRUB STREET. Now, I understand that a student run publication (but Federally funded: $10,000 last I heard, but it could me more or less - it's what I heard) is not going to produce the best kept secrets in Baltimore; but the reality is, the publication turned down numerous submissions that were of an 'otherly nature, i.e., experimental, avant garde, not 'I' or image centered (whatever these terms mean, I'm referring to texts that are not necessarily 'challenging'). Yet the fact remains, GRUB STREET does not publish innovative student literature.

We started publishing Ambit:Journal of Poetry and Poetics with an eye to disseminating new and challenging student writing. It was initially made up of mostly Baltimorean acts but people from NYC, Washington, D.C., and the west coast also sent me work: it was, so to speak, a mingling of talents that may never have crossed paths.

Ambit is now distributed nationwide but mostly through word of mouth, at readings, and from the website. And we're currently working on the third, and possibly last issue.

We also started the 'Serial Pamphleteers Edition' to highlight writers who were working 'serially.' I know the term is broad, but that is always the point: never to pindown a particular reading. It's slowly expanding. We're doing 26 editions, A through Z, in an edition of 50. The latest issue, 'g', is Betsy Andrews' 'New Jersey,' which is being sold now exclusively at her readings. We'll be doing a second run in a few weeks.

I wanted to talk about Ambit and the Pamphlets especially because it defines our purpose: to give texts space. Many journals, especially, combine texts, which run into each other. Page breaks are irrelevant or non-existent. In Ambit, white space almost dominates, gives the text a point of reference, enough room to breathe, enough room for the reader to play in the space of that text. The Serial Pamphlets take this one step further, and give the poem its own location, in other words, in a bound, uncompromized booklet. All the journals, pamphlets, books, chaps, etc. are all hand bound with handmade artwork. Nothing escapes our fingerprints.

The next logical step, I thought, should be minimally aesthetic (disregarding artwork for the text's full autonomy) and bibliographic/documentary in nature. This is where I had devised the idea for our zine series (notice 'series' is an important factor in the press' life). I'm interested in publishing ALL the poets I come into contact with. Simply. But on a small scale. The idea is to collect texts from individual writers, 8 to 16 pages that fit on a 4.25 inch by 5.5 inch format, and to produce 'zines' that can be traded for other zines, like baseball cards, that can be collected (I'm hoping this project will take the series into the hundreds [of writers]). It seems a little self-indulgent, but I am slowly learning the marginalizing politics involved with poetry. I know communities are small and sparse (imagine Baltimore: I'm just learning what presses exist in the area) and that documentation is totally necessary. I'd like to see all of my contemporaries in the series. The
 zines are pressed initially in an edition of 60 until they run out. Then I'll think about making more. Later on down the line, of course, so the zines have time to circulate. Hopefully I can box them all together like a baseball card set. It's also an archiving venture, as a reminder of who I'm working with and against at the same time.

This is a call for submissions for the zine. And I mean EVERYONE is involved. The idea is to send work that demonstrates where you are at the moment in your projects. It is, naturally, bibliographic in nature: each zine has a cardstock cover, name on cover, but no title page: open the zine and delve into the text, no frills. Each is numbered in the series.

I'm opening submissions as of now, formally, and am inviting everyone to take part in this project/experiment. I'll send each contributor 5 copies. I'm selling them or giving them away for a quarter each. By mail, you can purchase each for a quarter plus an SASE. I'll have a list of contributors whenI've finished the first ten in the series. I'm currently working on no. 6.
Response has been good. Folks have contributed and zines are already circulating: my thanks and love go out to each of them. Let's makes poetry what it's supposed to be: public, not commodified.
Thanks all for reading. I am in debt to you all.

By the way - Ambit:Journal of Poetry and Poetics is no longer a student based magazine. It's focus remains as a gallery: we publish writers who write over the expanse of pages, so we take more submissions from fewer writers, so that their work can be seen to evolve. The writer is given more room and freedom to work in. Let's say about 60 pages next issue for no more than 6 writers?
That's the point.

Ciao,
Chris

Surely, but I suppose I would take sides with Rosenthal here and argue that
confessionalism quickly bifurcated (multifurcated?) and what came to be
known pejoratively as confessional (those adjectives that Mark Weiss listed
and that quickly leap to mind for us all) has more to do with Sexton's
influence than Lowell's, who even later seemed to consider himself a
Poundian. Lowell and Snodgrass hardly seem confessional at all any more.
Maybe it's a useless term. Maybe it's a minor distinction. But it's a
distinction that interests me in the current climate, which seems to involve
a good number of poets seeking middle ground between the lyric I and
obliviation of it.

"We always talk about Lowell as the most influential
Confessionalist, but it seems to me that the
Confessional and post-confessional lines from the
70s through today have been most influenced by
Sexton's drama and violence (directed both at self and
other)."

Yes, but the line of influence generally goes back to
Lowell, as Sexton was Lowell's student in 1957, when
Lowell was drafting Life Studies (1959), right?

Best,
J

hi ann
i'll have to look to see if i hace franz wright, irene's friend stephanie
at random house sends me piles of books, the last was a stack of knopf
poetry. knopf is part of random house. franz is james wright's son.

here is my "edition" of   Lydia H. Sigourney's Pocahontas, (1841).

<pre style="font-family: 'Goudy Old Style'; font-size: larger;">

<h2>POCAHONTAS.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<font style="font-size: large;">C<font style="font-size:
smaller;">LIME</font></font> of the West! that, slumbering long and deep,
Beneath thy misty mountains' solemn shade,
And, lull'd by melancholy winds that sweep
The unshorn forest and untrodden glade,
Heard not the cry when mighty empires died,
Nor caught one echo from oblivion's tide,
While age on age its stormy voyage made:
See! Europe, watching from her sea-girt shore,
Extends the sceptred hand, and bids thee dream no more.

<h3>II.</h3>
Say, was it sweet, in cradled rest to lie,
And 'scape the ills that older regions know?
Prolong the vision'd trance of infancy,
And hide from manhood's toil, mischance and wo?
Sweet, by the margin of thy sounding streams
Freely to rove, and nurse illusive dreams,
Nor taste the fruits on thorny trees that grow?
The evil, and the sorrow, and the crime,
That make the harass'd earth grow old before her time?

<h3>III.</h3>
Clime of the West! that to the hunter's bow,
And roving hordes of savage men, wert sold,
Their cone-roof'd wigwams pierced the wintry snow,
Their tassel'd corn crept sparsely through the mould,
Their bark canoes thy glorious waters clave,
The chase their glory, and the wild their grave:
Look up! a loftier destiny behold,
For to thy coast the fair-hair'd Saxon steers,
Rich with the spoils of time, the lore of bards and seers.

<h3>IV.</h3>
Behold a sail! another, and another!
Like living things on the broad river's breast;
What were thy secret thoughts, oh red-brow'd brother,
As toward the shore those white-wing'd wanderers press'd?
But lo! emerging from her forest-zone,
The bow and quiver o'er her shoulder thrown,
With nodding plumes her raven tresses dress'd,
Of queenly step, and form erect and bold,
Yet mute with wondering awe, the New World meets the Old.

<h3>V.</h3>
Roll on, majestic flood, in power and pride,
Which like a sea doth swell old ocean's sway;
With hasting keel, thy pale-faced sponsors glide
To keep the pageant of thy christening day:
They bless thy wave, they bid thee leave unsung
The uncouth baptism of a barbarous tongue,
And take his name&mdash;the Stuart's&mdash;first to bind
The Scottish thistle in the lion's mane,
Of all old Albion's kings, most versatile and vain.

<h3>VI.</h3>
Spring robes the vales. With what a flood of light
She holds her revels in this sunny clime;
The flower-sown turf, like bossy velvet bright,
The blossom'd trees exulting in their prime,
The leaping streamlets in their joyous play,
The birds that frolic mid the diamond spray,
Or heavenward soar, with melody sublime:
What wild enchantment spreads a fairy wing,
As from their prisoning ships the enfranchised strangers spring.

<h3>VII.</h3>
Their tents are pitch'd, their spades have broke the soil,
The strong oak thunders as it topples down,
Their lily-handed youths essay the toil,
That from the forest rends its ancient crown:
Where are your splendid halls, which ladies tread,
Your lordly boards, with every luxury spread,
Virginian sires&mdash;ye men of old renown?
Though few and faint, your ever-living chain
Holds in its grasp two worlds, across the surging main.

<h3>VIII.</h3>
Yet who can tell what fearful pangs of wo
Those weary-hearted colonists await,
When to its home the parting ship must go,
And leave them in their exile, desolate?
Ah, who can paint the peril and the pain,
The failing harvest, and the famish'd train,
The wily foe, with ill-dissembled hate,
The sickness of the heart, the wan despair,
Pining for one fresh draught of its dear native air?

<h3>IX.</h3>
Yet, mid their cares, one hallow'd dome they rear'd,
To nurse devotion's consecrated flame;
And there a wondering world of forests heard,
First borne in solemn chant, Jehovah's name;
First temple to his service, refuge dear
 From strong affliction and the alien's tear,
How swell'd the sacred song, in glad acclaim:
England, sweet mother! many a fervent prayer
There pour'd its praise to Heaven for all thy love and care.

<h3>X.</h3>
And they who 'neath the vaulted roof had bow'd
Of some proud minster of the olden time,
Or where the vast cathedral towards the cloud
Rear'd its dark pile in symmetry sublime,
While through the storied pane the sunbeam play'd,
Tinting the pavement with a glorious shade,
Now breath'd from humblest fane their ancient chime:
And learn'd they not, His presence sure might dwell
With every seeking soul, though bow'd in lowliest cell?

<h3>XI.</h3>
Yet not quite unadorn'd their house of prayer:
The fragrant offspring of the genial morn
They duly brought; and fondly offer'd there
The bud that trembles ere the rose is born,
The blue clematis, and the jasmine pale,
The scarlet woodbine, waving in the gale,
The rhododendron, and the snowy thorn,
The rich magnolia, with its foliage fair,
High priestess of the flowers, whose censer fills the air.

<h3>XII.</h3>
Might not such incense please thee, Lord of love?
Thou, who with bounteous hand dost deign to show
Some foretaste of thy Paradise above,
To cheer the way-worn pilgrim here below?
Bidd'st thou mid parching sands the fiow'ret meek
Strike its frail root and raise its tinted cheek,
And the slight pine defy the arctic snow,
That even the skeptic's frozen eye may see
On Nature's beauteous page what lines she writes of Thee?

<h3>XIII.</h3>
What groups, at Sabbath morn, were hither led!
Dejected men, with disappointed frown,
Spoil'd youths, the parents' darling and their dread,
 From castles in the air hurl'd ruthless down,
The sea-bronzed mariner, the warrior brave,
The keen gold-gatherer, grasping as the grave;
Oft, mid these mouldering walls, which nettles crown,
Stern breasts have lock'd their purpose and been still,
And contrite spirits knelt, to learn their Maker's will.

<h3>XIV.</h3>
Here, in his surplice white, the pastor stood,
A holy man, of countenance serene,
Who, mid the quaking earth or fiery flood
Unmoved, in truth's own panoply, had been
A fair exaniple of his own pure creed;
Patient of error, pitiful to need,
Persuasive wisdom in his thoughtful mien,
And in that Teacher's heavenly meekness bless'd,
Who laved his followers' feet with towel-girded vest.

<h3>XV.</h3>
Music upon the breeze! the savage stays
His flying arrow as the strain goes by;
He starts! he listens! lost in deep amaze,
Breath half-suppress'd, and lightning in his eye.
Have the clouds spoken? Do the spirits rise
 From his dead fathers' graves, with wildering melodies?
Oft doth he muse, 'neath midnight's solemn sky,
On those deep tones, which, rising o'er the sod,
Bore forth, from hill to hill, the white man's hymn to God.

<h3>XVI.</h3>
News of the strangers stirr'd Powhatan's dreams,
The mighty monarch of the tribes that roam
A thousand forests, and on countless streams
Urge the swift bark and dare the cataract's foam;
The haughtiest chieftains in his presence stood
Tame as a child, and from the field of blood
His war-cry thrill'd with fear the foeman's home:
His nod was death, his frown was fix'd as fate,
Unchangeable his love, invincible his hate.

<h3>XVII.</h3>
A forest-child, amid the flowers at play!
Her raven locks in strange profusion flowing;
A sweet, wild girl, with eye of earnest ray,
And olive cheek, at each emotion glowing;
Yet, whether in her gladsome frolic leaping,
Or 'neath the greenwood shade unconscious sleeping,
Or with light oar her fairy pinnace rowing,
Still, like the eaglet on its new-fledged wing,
Her spirit-glance bespoke the daughter of a king.

<h3>XVIII.</h3>
But he, that wily monarch, stern and old,
Mid his grim chiefs, with barbarous trappings bright,
That morn a court of savage state did hold.
The sentenced captive see&mdash;his brow how white!
Stretch'd on the turf his manly form lies low,
The war-club poises for its fatal blow,
The death-mist swims before his darken'd sight:
Forth springs the child, in tearful pity bold,
Her head on his declines, her arms his neck enfold.

<h3>XIX.</h3>
&ldquo;The child! what madness fires her? Hence! Depart!
Fly, daughter, fly! before the death-stroke rings;
Divide her, warriors, from that English heart.&rdquo;
In vain! for with convulsive grasp she clings:
She claims a pardon from her frowning sire;
Her pleading tones subdue his gather'd ire;
And so, uplifting high his feathery dart,
That doting father gave the child her will,
And bade the victim live, and be his servant still.

<h3>XX.</h3>
Know'st thou what thou hast done, thou dark-hair'd child?
What great events on thy compassion hung?
What prowess lurks beneath yon aspect mild,
And in the accents of that foreign tongue?
As little knew the princess who descried
A floating speck on Egypt's turbid tide,
A bulrush-ark the matted reeds among,
And, yielding to an infant's tearful smile,
Drew forth Jehovah's seer, from the devouring Nile.

<h3>XXI.</h3>
In many a clime, in many a battle tried,
By Turkish sabre and by Moorish spear;
Mid Afric's sands, or Russian forests wide,
Romantic, bold, chivalrous, and sincere,
Keen-eyed, clear-minded, and of purpose pure,
Dauntless to rule, or patient to endure,
Was he whom thou hast rescued with a tear:
Thou wert the saviour of the Saxon vine,
And for this deed alone our praise and love are thine.

<h3>XXII.</h3>
Nor yet for this alone shall history's scroll
Embalm thine image with a grateful tear;
For when the grasp of famine tried the soul,
When strength decay'd, and dark despair was near,
Who led her train of playmates, day by day,
O'er rock, and stream, and wild, a weary way,
Their baskets teeming with the golden ear?
Whose generous hand vouchsafed its tireless aid
To guard a nation's germ? Thine, thine, heroic maid!

<h3>XXIII.</h3>
On sped the tardy seasons, and the hate
Of the pale strangers wrung the Indian breast.
Their hoary prophet breathed the ban of fate:
&ldquo;Hence with the thunderers! Hide their race, un-bless'd,
Deep 'neath the soil they falsely call their own;
For from our fathers' graves a hollow moan,
Like the lash'd surge, bereaves my soul of rest.
&lsquo;They come! They come!' it cries.&lsquo;Ye once were brave:
Will ye resign the world that the Great Spirit gave?&rsquo; &rdquo;

<h3>XXIV.</h3>
Yet 'neath the settled countenance of guile
They veil'd their vengeful purpose, dark and dire,
And wore the semblance of a quiet smile,
To lull the victim of their deadly ire:
But ye, who hold of history's scroll the pen,
Blame not too much those erring, red-brow'd men,
Though nursed in wiles. Fear is the white-lipp'd sire
Of subterfuge and treachery. 'Twere in vain
To bid the soul be true, that writhes beneath his chain.

<h3>XXV.</h3>
Night, moonless night! The forest hath no sound
But the low shiver of its dripping leaves,
Save here and there, amid its depths profound,
The sullen sigh the prowling panther heaves,
Save the fierce growling of the cubless bear,
Or tramp of gaunt wolf rushing from his lair,
Where its slow coil the poisonous serpent weaves:
Who dares the dangerous path at hour so wild,
With fleet and fawnlike step? Powhatan's fearless child!

<h3>XXVI.</h3>
&ldquo;Up, up&mdash;away! I heard the words of power,
Those secret vows that seal a nation's doom,
Bid the red flame burst forth at midnight hour,
And make th'unconscious slumberer's bed his tomb,
Spare not the babe&mdash;the rose-leaf of a day&mdash;
But shred the sapling, like the oak, away.
I heard the curse! My soul is sick with gloom:
Wake, chieftains, wake! avert the hour of dread!&rdquo;
And with that warning voice the guardian-angel fled.

<h3>XXVII.</h3>
On sped the seasons, and the forest-child
Was rounded to the symmetry of youth;
While o'er her features stole, serenely mild,
The trembling sanctity of woman's truth,
Her modesty, and simpleness, and grace:
Yet those who deeper scan the human face,
Amid the trial-hour of fear or ruth,
Might clearly read, upon its heaven-writ scroll,
That high and firm resolve which nerved the Roman soul.

<h3>XXVIII.</h3>
The simple sports that charm'd her childhood's way,
Her greenwood gambols mid the matted vines,
The curious glance of wild and searching ray,
Where innocence with ignorance combines,
Were changed for deeper thought's persuasive air,
Or that high port a princess well might wear:
So fades the doubtful star when morning shines;
So melts the young dawn at the enkindling ray,
And on the crimson cloud casts off its mantle gray.

<h3>XXIX.</h3>
On sped the tardy seasons. Need I say
What still the indignant lyre declines to tell?
How, by rude hands, the maiden, borne away,
Was forced amid the invaders' homes to dwell?
Yet no harsh bonds the guiltless prisoner wore,
No sharp constraint her gentle spirit bore,
Held as a hostage in the stranger's cell;
So, to her wayward fate submissive still,
She meekly bow'd her heart to learn a Saviour's will.

<h3>XXX.</h3>
And holy was the voice that taught her ear
How for our sins the Lord of life was slain;
While o'er the listener's bosom flow'd the tear
Of wondering gratitude, like spring-tide rain.
New joys burst forth, and high resolves were born
To choose the narrow path that worldlings scorn,
And walk therein. Oh, happy who shall gain
 From the brief cloud that in his path may lie
A heritage sublime, a mansion in the sky.

<h3>XXXI.</h3>
In graceful youth, within the house of prayer,
Who by the sacred font so humbly kneels,
And with a tremulous yet earnest air,
The deathless vow of Christian fealty seals?
The Triune Name is breathed with hallow'd power,
The dew baptismal bathes the forest-flower,
And, lo her chasten'd smile that hope reveals
Which nerved the weary dove o'er floods unbless'd
The olive-leaf to pluck, and gain the ark of rest.

<h3>XXXII.</h3>
Pour forth your incense; fragrant shrubs and flowers,
Wave your fresh leaflets, and with beauty glow;
And wake the anthem in your choral bowers,
Birds, whose warm hearts with living praise o'erflow;
For she who loved your ever-varied dyes,
Mingling her sweet tones with your symphonies,
Seeks higher bliss than charms like yours bestow&mdash;
A home unchangeable&mdash;an angel's wing&mdash;
Where is no fading flower, nor lute with jarring string.

<h3>XXXIII.</h3>
Another change. The captive's lot grew fair:
A soft illusion with her reveries blent,
New charms dispell'd her solitary care,
And hope's fresh dewdrops gleam'd where'er she went;
Earth seem'd to glow with Eden's purple light,
The fleeting days glanced by on pinions bright,
And every hour a rainbow lustre lent;
While, with his tones of music in her ear,
Love's eloquence inspired the high-born cavalier.

<h3>XXXIV.</h3>
Yet love, to her pure breast was but a name
For kindling knowledge, and for taste refined,
A guiding lamp, whose bright, mysterious flame
Led on to loftier heights the aspiring mind.
Hence flow'd the idiom of a foreign tongue
All smoothly o'er her lip; old history flung
Its annal wide, like banner on the wind,
And o'er the storied page, with rapture wild,
A new existence dawn'd on nature's fervent child.

<h3>XXXV.</h3>
A throng is gathering; for the hallow'd dome
At evening tide is rich with sparkling light,
And from its verdant bound each rural home
Sends forth its blossom'd gifts, profusely bright;
While here and there, amid the clustering flowers,
Some stately chief or painted warrior towers,
Hail'd as a brother mid the festal rite:
Peace waves her garland o'er the favour'd place
Where weds the new-born West, with Europe's lordly race.

<h3>XXXVI.</h3>
A group before the altar. Breathe thy vow,
Loving and stainless one, without a fear;
For he who wins thee to his bosom now,
Gem of the wild, unparalleled and dear,
Will guard thee ever, as his treasure rare,
With changeless tenderness and constant care;
How speaks his noble brow a soul sincere,
While the old white-hair'd king, with eye of pride,
Gives to his ardent hand the timid, trusting bride.

<h3>XXXVII.</h3>
Not with more heartfelt joy the warlike bands
Of Albion, spent with long, disastrous fray,
Beheld young Tudor cleanse his blood-stain'd hands,
And lead the blooming heir of York away,
'Neath the sweet music of the marriage bells;
Then on those tented hills and ravaged dells
The War of Roses died: no more the ray
Of white or red, the fires of hate illumed,
But from their blended roots the rose of Sharon bloom'd.

<h3>XXXVIII.</h3>
Young wife, how beautiful the months swept by.
Within thy bower methinks I view thee still:
The meek observance of thy lifted eye
Bent on thy lord, and prompt to do his will,
The care for him, the happiness to see
His soul's full confidence repose in thee,
The sacrifice of self, the ready skill
In duty's path, the love without alloy,
These gave each circling year a brighter crown of joy.

<h3>XXXIX.</h3>
Out on the waters! On the deep, deep sea!
Out, out upon the waters! Surging foam,
Swell'd by the winds, rolls round her wild and free,
And memory wandereth to her distant home,
To fragrant gales, the blossonm'd boughs that stir,
To the sad sire who fondly dreams of her;
But kindling smiles recall the thoughts that roam,
For at her side a bright-hair'd nursling plays,
While bends her bosom's lord with fond, delighted gaze.

<h3>XL.</h3>
And this is woman's world. It matters not
Though in the trackless wilderness she dwell,
Or on the cliff where hangs the Switzer's cot,
Or in the subterranean Greenland cell:
Her world is in the heart. Rude storms may rise,
And dark eclipse involve ambition's skies,
But dear affection's flame burns pure and well,
And therefore 'tis, with such a placid eye,
She sooths her loved ones' pangs, or lays her down to die.

<h3>XLI.</h3>
Lo! Albion's cliffs, in glorious light that shine,
Welcome the princess of the infant West.
'Twas nobly done, thou queen of Stuart's line,
To sooth the tremours of that stranger's breast;
And when, upon thy ladies richly dight,
She, through a flood of ebon tresses bright,
Uplifts the glances of a timid guest,
What saw she there? The greeting smiles that brought
O'er her own lofty brow its native hues of thought.

<h3>XLII.</h3>
But what delighted awe her accents breathed,
The gorgeous domes of ancient days to trace,
The castellated towers, with ivy wreathed,
The proud mementoes of a buried race;
Or 'neath some mighty minster's solemn pile,
Dim arch, and fretted roof, and long.drawn aisle,
How rush'd the heart's blood wildly to her face,
When, from the living organ's thunder-chime,
The full Te Deum burst in melody sublime.

<h3>XLIII.</h3>
Yet, mid the magic of those regal walls,
The glittering train, the courtier's flattering tone,
Or by her lord, through fair ancestral halls,
Led on, to claim their treasures as her own,
Stole back the scenery of her solitude:
An aged father, in his cabin rude,
Mix'd with her dreams a melancholy moan,
Notching his simple calendar with pain,
And straining his red eye to watch the misty main.

<h3>XLIV.</h3>
Prayer, prayer for him! when the young dawn arose
With its gray banner, or red day declined,
Up went his name, forever blent with those
Most close and strong around her soul entwined,
Husband and child; and, as the time drew near
To fold him to her heart with filial tear,
For her first home her warm affections pined.
That time&mdash;it came not! for a viewless hand
Was stretch'd to bar her foot from her green childhood's land.

<h3>XLV.</h3>
Sweet sounds of falling waters, cool and clear,
The crystal streams, her playmates, far away,
Oft, oft their dulcet music mock'd her ear,
As, restless, on her fever'd couch she lay;
Strange visions hover'd round, and harpings high,
 From spirit-bands, and then her lustrous eye
Welcomed the call; but earth resumed its sway,
And all its sacred ties convulsive twined.
How hard to spread the wing, and leave the loved behind.

<h3>XLVI.</h3>
Sunset in England at the autumn prime!
Through foliage rare, what floods of light were sent!
The full and whitening harvest knew its time,
And to the sickle of the reaper bent;
Forth rode the winged seeds upon the gale,
New homes to find; but she, with lip so pale,
Who on the arm of her beloved leant,
Breathed words of tenderness, with smile serene,
Though faint and full of toil, the gasp and groan between.

<h3>XLVII.</h3>
&ldquo;Oh, dearest friend, Death, cometh! He is here,
Here at my heart! Air! air! that I may speak
My hoarded love, my gratitude sincere,
To thee and to thy people. But I seek
In vain. Though most unworthy, yet I hear
A call, a voice too bless'd for mortal ear;&rdquo;
And with a marble coldness on her cheek,
And one long moan, like breaking harp-string sweet,
She bare the unspoken lore to her Redeemer's feet.

<h3>XLVIII.</h3>
Gone? <i>Gone?</i> Alas! the burst of wild despair
That rent his bosom who had loved so well;
He had not yet put forth his strength to bear,
So suddenly and sore the death-shaft fell:
Man hath a godlike might in danger's hour,
In the red battle, or the tempest's power;
Yet is he weak when tides of anguish swell;
Ah, who can mark with cold and tearless eyes
The grief of stricken man when his sole idol dies!

<h3>XLIX.</h3>
And she had fled, in whom his heart's deep joy
Was garner'd up; fled, like the rushing flame,
And left no farewell for her fair young boy.
Lo! in his nurse's arms he careless came,
A noble creature, with his full dark eye
And clustering curls, in nature's majesty;
But, with a sudden shriek, his mother's name
Burst from his lips, and, gazing on the clay,
He stretch'd his eager arms where the cold sleeper lay.

<h3>L.</h3>
&ldquo;Oh mother! mother!&rdquo; Did that bitter cry
Send a shrill echo through the realm of death?
Look, to the trembling fringes of the eye.
List, the sharp shudder of returning breath,
The spirit's sob! They lay him on her breast;
One long, long kiss on his bright brow she press'd;
Even from heaven's gate of bliss she lingereth,
To breathe one blessing o'er his precious head,
And then her arm unclasps, and she is of the dead.

<h3>LI.</h3>
The dead! the sainted dead! why should we weep
At the last change their settled features take?
At the calm impress of that holy sleep
Which care and sorrow never more shall break?
Believe we not His word who rends the tomb,
And bids the slumberers from that transient gloom
In their Redeemer's glorious image wake?
Approach we not the same sepulchral bourne
Swift as the shadow fleets? What time have we to mourn?

<h3>LII.</h3>
A little time thou found'st, O pagan king,
A little space, to murmur and repine:
Oh, bear a few brief months affliction's sting,
And gaze despondent o'er the billowy brine,
And then to the Great Spirit, dimly traced
Through cloud and tempest, and with fear embraced,
In doubt and mystery, thy breath resign;
And to thy scorn'd and perish'd people go,
 From whose long-trampled dust our flowers and herbage grow.

<h3>LIII.</h3>
Like the fallen leaves those forest-tribes have fled:
Deep 'neath the turf their rusted weapon lies;
No more their harvest lifts its golden head,
Nor from their shaft the stricken red-deer flies:
But from the far, far west, where holds, so hoarse,
The lonely Oregon, its rock-strewn course,
While old Pacific's sullen surge replies,
Are heard their exiled mutrmurings deep and low,
Like one whose smitten soul departeth full of wo.

<h3>LIV.</h3>
I would ye were not, from your fathers' soil,
Track'd like the dun wolf, ever in your breast
The coal of vengeance and the curse of toil;
I would we had not to your mad lip prest
The fiery poison-cup, nor on ye turn'd
The blood-tooth'd ban-dog, foaming, as he burn'd
To tear your flesh; but thrown in kindness bless'd
The brother's arm around ye, as ye trod,
And led ye, sad of heart, to the bless'd Lamb of God.

<h3>LV.</h3>
Forgotten race, farewell! Your haunts we tread,
Our mighty rivers speak your words of yore,
Our mountains wear them on their misty head,
Our sounding cataracts hurl them to the shore;
But on the lake your flashing oar is still,
Hush'd is your hunter's cry on dale and hill,
Your arrow stays the eagle's flight no more;
And ye, like troubled shadows, sink to rest
In unremember'd tombs, unpitied and unbless'd.

<h3>LVI.</h3>
The council-fires are quench'd, that erst so red
Their midnight volume mid the groves entwined;
King, stately chief, and warrior-host are dead,
Nor remnant nor memorial left behind:
But thou, O forest-princess, true of heart,
When o'er our fathers waved destruction's dart,
Shalt in their children's loving hearts be shrined;
Pure, lonely star, o'er dark oblivion's wave,
It is not meet thy name should moulder in the grave.

<i>Their tassel'd corn.</i>
<p>To those not familiar with the appearance of the Indian corn, on whose
cultivation the aborigines of America relied as a principal article of
subsistence, it may be well to say that a silky fibre, sometimes compared
to a tassel, is protruded from the extremity of the sheath which envelops
the golden ear, or sheaf of that stately and beautiful vegetable.</p>
<h4>Stanza vi., line 1.</h4>
<i>Spring robes the vales.</i>
<p>The ships which bore the Virginian colonists&mdash;the founders of our
nation&mdash;entered the Chesapeake April 26, 1607; and on the 13th of May,
five
months from the time of setting sail from England, which was December
19th, 1606, a permanent embarkation was effected at Jamestown, fifty miles
up that noble river, to which the name of James was given, in honour of
the reigning monarch.</p>
<h4>Stanza vii., line 3.</h4>
<i>Their lily-handed youths essay the toil.</i>
<p>&ldquo;The axe frequently blistered their tender fingers, so that many times
every third blow had a loud oath to drown its
echo.&rdequo;&mdash;<i>Hillard's Life of
Captain Smith.</i></p>
<h4>Stanza ix., line 8.</h4>
<i>England, sweet mother.</i>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, bless England, our sweet native country,&rdquo; was the
morning and
evening prayer in the church at Jamestown, the first church erected in our
Western world.</p>
<h4>Stanza xi., line 2.</h4>
<i>The fragrant offspring of the genial morn
They duly brought.</i>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of each day they assembled in the little church,
which
was kept neatly trimmed with the wild flowers of the
country.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bancroft,</i>vol. i., p. 141.</p>
<h4>Stanza xiii., line 3.</h4>
<i>Spoil'd youths.</i>
<p>&ldquo;A great part of the new company who came out in 1609,&rdquo; says the
historian Stith, &ldquo;consisted of unruly sparks, packed off by their
friends to
escape worse destinies at home. The rest were chiefly made up of poor
gentlemen, broken tradesmen, footmen, and such others as were fitter to
spoil and ruin a commonwealth than to help to raise and maintain one.
&lsquo;When you send again,&rsquo; Captain Smith was constrained to write
to the
Corporation in London, &lsquo;I entreat you, rather send but thirty carpenters,
husbandmen, gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths, masons, and diggers-up
of trees' roots, than a thousand of such as we have&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<h4>Stanza xiv., line 1.</h4>
<i>Here, in his surplice white, the pastor stood.</i>
<p>&ldquo;The morning-star of the church was the Rev. Mr. Hunt, sent out by
the London company in 1606. among the leaders of the infant colony. It
was he who administered the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for the first
time in Virginia at Jamestown, the first permanent habitation of the
English in America, and the site of the first Christian temple. He was a man
of a truly humble, meek, and peaceful spirit, and it is impossible now to
estimate the value of the beneficial influence he exercised upon the fortunes
of the colony. His kind offices as peacemaker were frequently interposed
to harmonize differences which would have been fatal to the enterprise;
and his example of suffering affliction, and of patience in sickness, in
poverty, in peril, cheered his drooping companions, inspiring them with such
fortitude, and stimulating them to such efforts, as, with the blessing of
Providence, enabled them to maintain their difficult
positions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Rev. Philip Slaughter.</i></p>
<h4>Stanza xvi., line 2.</h4>
<i>The mighty monarch of the tribes that roam
A thousandforests.</i>
<p>Powhatan, the king of the country where the founders of Virginia first
chose their residence, was said to hold dominion over thirty nations or
tribes who inhabited that region; and being possessed both of arbitrary
power and much native talent, his enmity was dreaded, and pains taken by
the colonists to conciliate his friendship.</p>
<h4>Stanza xvii., line 1.</h4>
<i>A forest-child, amid the flowers at play.</i>
<p>&ldquo;Pocahontas, the daughter of Powhatan, a girl of ten or twelve
years of
age, who, not only for feature, countenance, and expression, much exceeded
any of the rest of her people, but for wit and spirit was the only
nonpareil of the country.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Captain John Smith.</i></p>
<h4>Stanza xix., line 9.</h4>
<i>And bade the victim live, and be his servant still.</i>
<p>&ldquo;Live! live!&rdquo; said the softened monarch, &ldquo;and make
hatchets for me
and necklaces for Pocahontas.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Stanza xxi., line 6.</h4>
<i>Dauntless to rule, or patient to endure.</i>
<p>The extraordinary features in the character of Captain John Smith, and
the strange incidents which made almost the whole of his life a romance,
are exhibited by many historians. Hillard, in his biography of him, says,
&ldquo;We see him performing at the same time the offices of a provident
governor, a valiant soldier, an industrious labourer, capable alike of
commanding and of executing. He seemed to court the dangers from which other
men shrank, or which they encountered only from a sense of duty. As
the storm darkens around him, his spirit grows more bright and serene.
That which appals and disheartens others only animates him. He had a
soul of fire, encased in a frame of adamant. Thus was he enabled to endure
and accomplish all the promptings of his adventurous spirit.&ldquo; &rdquo;He
was the father of Virginia,&rdquo; says Bancroft in his history, &ldquo;the
true leader
who first planted the Saxon vine in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Stanza xxii., line 7.</h4>
<i>Their baskets teeming with the golden ear.</i>
<p>When the colony was in danger of utter extinction from the want of
food, her zeal and benevolence never slumbered. Accompanied by her
companions, the child Pocahontas came every few days to the fort with
baskets of corn for the starving garrison. Smith, in his letter to Queen
Anne, writes, &ldquo;She, next under God, was the instrument to preserve this
colony from death, famine, and utter confusion, which, if in those times
had once been dissolved, Virginia might have lain as it was at our first
arrival unto this day.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Stanza xxvi., line 9.</h4>
<i>And, with that warning voice, the guardian angelfled.</i>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding, the eternal, all-seeing God did prevent the plot of
Powhatan, and by a strange means. For Pocahontas, his dearest jewel
and daughter, came through the irksome woods in that dark night, and
told us that great cheer might be sent us by-and-by, but that the king, and
all the power he could make, would afterward come and kill us all.
Therefore, if we would live, she wished us presently to be gone. Such things as
she delighted in we would have given her; but, with tears running down
her cheeks, she said she durst not be seen to have them; for, if Powhatan
should know it, she were but dead. And so she ran away by herself, as
she caine.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Captain Smith.</i></p>
<h4>Stanza xxix., line 7.</h4>
<i>Held as a hostage.</i>
<p>The object of the capture and detention of the princess seems to have
been to bring her father to such terms as the colonists desired, or to extort
from him a large ransom; both of which designs were frustrated.</p>
<h4>Stanza xxxv., line 9.</h4>
<i>Where weds the new-born West with Europe's lordly race.</i>
<p>The marriage of Mr. Rolfe with Pocahontas took place in the church at
Jamestown in the month of April, 1613, and gave great delight to Powhatan
and his chieftains, who were present at the ceremony, and also to the
English, and proved a bond of peace and amity between them as lasting
as the life of the Indian king.</p>
<h4>Stanza xxxvii., line 9.</h4>
<i>But from their blended roots the rose of Sharon bloom'd.</i>
<p>The rose striped with white and red, sometimes called the rose of
Sharon, has been said, in some ancient legend, to have been first seen in
England after the marriage of Henry VII. to Elizabeth, daughter of Edward
IV., when the civil war which had so long raged with bitterness was
terminated, and the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York
ceased to be the unnatural symbols of bloodshed.</p>
<h4>Stanza xli., line 3.</h4>
<i>'Twas nobly done, thou queen of Stuart's line.</i>
<p>On the 12th of June, 1616, Mr. Rolfe, with his Indian wife, who, after
her baptism, was known by the name of the Lady Rebecca, arrived in
England. Her merits had preceded her, and secured for her the attentions
and hospitality of persons of rank and influence. The queen of James I.,
the reigning monarch, treated her with affability and respect. &ldquo;It
pleased
both the king's and queen's majesties,&rdquo; writes Captain Smith,
&ldquo;honourably to esteem her, accompanied with that honourable lady, the
Lady Delaware, and that honourable lord her husband, and divers other
persons of
good quality, both publicly and at the masks and concerts, to her great
satisfaction and content.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Stanza xliii., line 8.</h4>
<i>Notching his simple calendar.</i>
<p>The mode of computation by cutting notches upon a stick prevailed
among many of our aboriginal tribes. One of the council of Powhatan,
who accompanied Pocahontas, was directed in this manner to mark the
number of the people he might meet. He obtained a very long cane on his
landing, and commenced the task. But he soon became weary of this manner of
taking the census, and, on his return home, said to his king, &ldquo;Count
the stars in the sky, the leaves on the trees, the sands on the seashore, but
not the people of England.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Stanza l., line 9.</h4>
<i>And then her arm unclasps, and she is of the dead.</i>
<p>Early in the year 1617, while preparing to return to her native land, she
was taken sick, and died at the age of twenty-two. She was buried at
Gravesend. Her firmness and resignation proved the sincerity of her piety;
and, as Bancroft eloquently observes, &ldquo;She was saved, as if by the
hand of
mercy, from beholding the extermination of the tribes from which she
sprang, leaving a spotless name, and dwelling in memory under the form of
perpetual youth.&rdquo;</p>

i don't think a term, any term, is useless, and of course, personal agenda is
invoked here, the middle ground is an important place. the position of the I
in the current climate, any current climate, is an issue for every writer,
whether they say the I or not. so, i guess, clarity comes center, the use of the
I becomes a word choice like anything else, and so the I becomes just a word,
which is what it is. to think we could accept a confession that omits the I,
if appropriate, is to expand and integrate "confessionalism," and make it
useful, instead of unfashionable, and nurture the confessionalist urge in all of
us.

Thoughts on confessional poetry and non-confessional
poetry:


1. It is mostly those with relatively privileged
positions in the social hierarchy who denigrate
confession and seek to efface their (our)
identity/subjectivity/voice, whathaveyou. White men
are traditionally more experimental poets than strung
out Filipino crack whores, or so my preliminary
investigation into this matter suggests.

2. Those who have been denied access to the symbolic
order of language (ie, those who have been denied a
self, a voice, in more violent ways than the average
late capitalist subject) seem to be less familiar with
the work of Roland Barthes, Wittgenstein, et al.

3. Question: are confessional and autobiographical
commutable or simply coterminous? Further, in fiction,
is it true that when women insert themselves into
their work this is seen as a fairly transparent
autobiographical/confessional move whereas when men do
it it’s more likely deemed meta-fiction (ie., more
intellectual, better)?

4. Are non-confessional treatments of traditionally
confessional subjects such as incest, rape, trauma
more poetic, more intelligent, better? (Compare, say,
Kathy Acker’s use and abuse of incest with Sapphire’s
notion of ‘taking part in the transcendence of
victimhood,’ tho I guess Acker ain’t poetry.)

5. Can we agree that “Innate in nearly every artistic
nature is a luscious and treacherous penchant for
acknowledging the injustice that creates beauty and
for sympathizing with and paying homage to
aristocratic privilege.”

6. When I forced South Korean adolescents to covertly
write poetry (under video surveillance in a
cram-school in Seoul) there poems looked  radically
confessional, and I mean experimental.

7.  I’m on a fucking roll. My author-function is
kicking some fucking high mucketymuck ass.

8.  In Nick Pimbiono’s correspondence (not w/ me), he
mentioned that it was important that his work have
something which a person in pain could hold onto. I I
I have a tremendous amount of respect for this (and
how will I ever get tenure in this cutthroat world of
smartypants?).

9. I agree with Bruce Andrew’s politics but he’d be
better off in a more confessional mode. His stuff is
too earnest as it is.

10. I don't like confessional poetry but I adore
interviews with non-confessional poets (speaking of
which, if instead of dying when the poet was young,
David Antin’s father had repeatedly sodomized young
David until the age of 16, would Antin’s talks be more
or less confessional do we suppose?).

11. Doesn’t PROPER experimentation depend on many
things like access to a good library, the belief that
one isn’t a worthless vile sack of shit, a relatively
stable state of mind (I stumbled on an interview with
“Franz Wright” the other day; aside from alcoholism,
chronic depression and bi-polar disorder can be
marvelous ways to die quietly without helping anyone).

I'm really disturbed by Andrew Loewen's post, which purports to show
how a critique of confessionalism is the province of the privileged,
but does so by employing misogynist terms of abuse and leaning
weirdly on images of Asians who are either degraded ("strung out
Filipino crack whores"?!) or objects of implied violence ("When I
forced South Korean adolescents...under video surveillance..."),
which makes it hard to believe that he takes his own criticism
seriously, or that he has much sympathy for the supposedly less
privileged position of the woman or the Asian.

I'd actually signed on to add something to what had seemed like a
promising discussion on confessionalism: the _Columbia History of
American Poetry_ (ed. Jay Parini) has an essay by Diane Middlebrook,
"What Was Confessional Poetry?", which provides some historical
context for the first poets to be labeled "confessional" (Lowell,
Sexton, Snodgrass, Plath) and relates these writers to
psychoanalysis, Cold War politics, and the development of "a poetics
from within the woman's position."  There's another essay (less
historical, more schematic) by Gregory Orr on the "postconfessional"
lyric--a term I'm surprised no one's brought up, since it tends to be
frequently used to describe those current poets who are recognizably
working under the influence of confessional writing but also seem in
some way to critique it; Frank Bidart is one, and from the little
I've read of Franz Wright he might be another.  Both these essays are
more than ten years old at this point, but they do provide a way to
talk about confessional that goes beyond the binaries of I/not-I or
biographical/impersonal.

BC seen rejecting 2 gay men for post

By Alex Beam, Globe Staff, 4/8/2004


three-year effort to hire a professor for a prestigious endowed chair =20=

at Boston College has again ended in failure, this time amid charges =20
that the Rev. William Leahy, BC's president, rejected the leading =20
candidates because they are gay.


Mark Doty, a poet who lives in New York City and Provincetown, was the =20=

English department's top choice for the Rattigan Professorship, but he =20=

said that department members told him that his selection "had been =20
undercut" by Leahy and that the chair would not be filled.

"The final candidates were gay men, and I was told that this was an =20
issue," Doty said. "The process has imploded."

The department's second choice for the chairman -- Carl Phillips, a =20
professor of English, African, and Afro-American studies at Washington =20=

University in St. Louis who is also gay -- said the chairman of BC's =20
English department, Paul Lewis, called him last week to say "there were =20=

problems at the level of the president."

"This somehow had to do with the complicated issue of gay marriage and =20=

civil unions," Phillips said. "I called him and said: `Are you saying I =20=

didn't get this job because I am gay and have a domestic partner? =20
That's as if this happened 40 years ago, and I didn't get the job =20
because I am African-American.' He said it was like that."

Lewis indicated that his remarks might have been misconstrued. "We =20
never suggested that the president acted out of bias," Lewis said of =20
BC's English department. "We only asked questions about whether this =20
might be going on."

BC spokesman Jack Dunn confirmed that there had been a strong =20
difference of opinion between Leahy and the English department over =20
filling the Rattigan chair, but he vehemently denied that Doty's or =20
Phillips's sexual orientation played any role in Leahy's decision to =20
reject their candidacies in favor of Jonathan Schell, a highly regarded =20=

former New Yorker writer and a visiting professor at Yale Law School. =20=

Ultimately, none of the candidates was offered the position.

Leahy "wasn't aware that they were openly gay men until after the =20
fact," Dunn said. "He thought Schell was the best candidate to meet the =20=

needs of the students and of the English department."

Leahy declined a request for an interview. Dunn accused Lewis and his =20=

English department colleagues of sabotaging the search process after =20
Leahy passed over their choices. "The committee chose to inform the =20
candidates that the search was off," Dunn said. "Why did they forfeit =20=

the right to hire an excellent candidate just because he didn't fit =20
their narrow, personal agenda?"

Boston College is a Jesuit, Catholic college. Leahy has been a vocal =20
opponent of gay marriage. Last year, he granted official recognition to =20=

a gay-straight student alliance, which had unsuccessfully sought =20
official status three times previously.

BC officials point to an increased number of gay faculty and to the =20
recent hiring of a professor who teaches so-called queer theory in the =20=

English department as evidence that BC is evolving institutionally.

"Boston College is a most open and tolerant university," Dunn said. "We =20=

have gay faculty and students who flourish here and who contribute =20
mightily to the intellectual vibrancy of the university. Any assertion =20=

that sexual orientation plays into hiring here is completely unfounded."

The Rattigan professorship -- named after BC trustee Thomas Rattigan, =20=

the former chief executive of G. Heileman Brewing Co. -- has proved =20
difficult to fill. Three years ago, the college hoped to land a =20
prominent African-American scholar for the position, but he was =20
reluctant to leave his job.

Last year, a search committee was formed to find a specialist in =20
18th-century literature but was dissatisfied with the candidates. Last =20=

fall, a new search committee was established to hire a writer or poet =20=

for the vacant professorship.

The committee winnowed 120 names down to 20, and earlier this year the =20=

panel invited four finalists -- Doty, Phillips, Schell, and Margot =20
Livesey, a Cambridge novelist -- to visit the Chestnut Hill campus for =20=

two days. The candidates delivered lectures and met with top BC =20
teachers and administrators, albeit not with Leahy.

"It was arduous and extremely pleasant," Livesey said, echoing a theme =20=

struck by all four candidates describing their visits.

In March, the English department presented Leahy with its list of =20
finalists, ranked in order. Leahy responded that he wanted to hire =20
Schell, "to give the university another Alan Wolfe type," in the words =20=

of one official.

Wolfe, director of BC's Center for Religion and American Public Life, =20=

is a highly visible public intellectual who holds forth on spiritual =20
issues of the day for both academic and popular audiences.

The English department did not object to Schell's hiring, according to =20=

several professors, but twice sought reassurances from Leahy that, if =20=

Schell turned them down, their other candidates would be acceptable for =20=

the Rattigan post. Leahy never responded.

Schell said he doesn't know if he would have accepted the post if =20
offered it. "I was inclined to take it, but I didn't have a firm answer =20=

in my own mind," he said.

Both Doty and Phillips expressed surprise and regret at the outcome of =20=

the search.

"I would describe my response as more bewildered than anything else," =20=

Doty said. "I was invited to apply for the position, as I am sure the =20=

others were, as well. I had a very rewarding experience on campus. I =20
got no signal that sexual orientation might be an issue."

"It's an outrageous case of discrimination," Phillips said. "It would =20=

I don't buy your preliminary research (did it include
white male crack whores?).

Many writers of color who write "innovative" or
"experimental" work have had a very hard time being
taken seriously, either by a mainstream literary
establishment or by their own cultural communities. I
found the publication of the Manifesto of the "black
took collective" in a previous "Fence" to be very
interesting.

It seems to me that the dozens of brilliant non-white
experimental writers are ill-served by a
generalization that "experimental" writing is
performed by a privileged or education minority. I
could cite all the examples, but that seems besides
the point.

Besides doesn't "experimental" mean you are constantly
working against your own production as well as a
perceived "mainstream"? It makes it really difficult
to say who is "experimental" or not "experimental"?

Of course "experimental" and "confessional" or as
Timothy Yu wrote it "I/not-I" don't really exist as
binaries in any meaningful way. For example I am
currently reading "A Border Comedy" by Lyn Hejinian
and finding it beautifully (and purposefully)
problematic on exactly these questions. In my mind
Susan Howe is exactly as (moreso) confesseional as any
"confessional" poet--of course I could be doing a
profound misreading of Howe, but read "The Midnight"
and see if you don't see what I mean.

I don't believe in "Proper" Experimentation. It sounds
like it could be very boring.

Whew . . . and what color were Robert Lowell, is W.D. Snodgrass?  father figures
of the confessional undsoweiter . . . .

it has just come to my attention that the poetry I have been reading for the
last 50 years was actually a placebo -- I thought I was getting the
experimental stuff, felt much improved, happier, lost weight, built muscle
mass, heart rhythms straightened out --- effects not to be sneezed at no matter
how acquired --

Global Poetics continues at Wayne State!

This reading presents two New York poets whose work eloquently addresses
questions of urban space and memory, dystopia and hope, found objects and
loss in the aftermath of 9/11.

BRENDA COULTAS / New York, N.Y.
Author of A Handmade Museum (Coach House Press)
Brenda Coultas's A Handmade Museum is a unique collection of prose poems
based in and around the Bowery in New York. An assiduous dumpster diver,
experimental film maker, collector of disused objects and states of mind,
Coultas recovers, after the surrealists and New York artists such as Robert
Rauschenberg and Gordon Matta-Clark, the traces of hope in things that have
been left behind. Forging complex links between objects and memory, visual
beauty and felicitous juxtaposition, strategy and swerve, her poetic map of
the Bowery does nothing less than reconfigure the way we live public and
private, presence and absence, here and now.

MICHAEL GOTTLIEB / Lakeville, Conn.
Author of Lost and Found (Roof Books)
Michael Gottlieb pioneered the use of distressed texts and images in his
early language-centered work, which fashioned evanescent and lyric
constructions out of xeroxed detritus, recycled theater tickets,
disconnected punch lines. In his recent work, Lost and Found, Gottlieb uses
objects cast up by memory and disaster to provoke a radical
self-questioning about his generation, time, and history. Ron Silliman
calls his poetic sequence "the first great poetic work to emerge from the
trauma of September 11," but his writing is the opposite of the loop effect
of falling towers. With quizzical self-consciousness and tender regard,
Gottlieb traces the outlines of our displacement.

I'll give five books for free the rest is up to you:

"Last One Out" by Deborah Richards
"The Opening Question" by Prageeta Sharma
"Commons" by Myung Mi Kim
"PLOT" by Claudia Rankine
"Rules of the House" by Tsering Wangmo Dhompa

Even beginning this list makes me feel like I am
insulting both the writers I named and ones I don't.
Feels a little like "tokenizing."

It's a crude swipe (also such an old one) to suggest
that "innovative" or "experimental" writing seems
largely the province of white male writers. It may in
fact be true that experimental writing by these
writers is much more published, read, and paid
attention; it also seems that those few "experimental"
writers of color who are embraced release the pressure
to read and publish the comprehensive range of
poetries that is being written. For example, for every
Myung Mi Kim or Claudia Rankine on the above list that
we know and may read there are tons of writers like
them who are just as marginalized and ignored as
before.

The other point I want to raise is that for many
writers of color our sources are diverse. We don't
dismiss writers who came before us based on aesthetics
quite so easily. I remember being at a reading citing
Agha Shahid Ali as a major influence on my work and
elliciting quite a surprised reaction from folks who
did not see how Shahid's "new formalist" bent was
reflected anywhere in my work.

wow i must have deleted this thing that people are responding to.
this is outrageous. kazim, timothy and aldon have already responded
in more detail.  i just want to express horror at the above sentence;
and to disagree most emphatically with its semantic content; and
distance myself as much as possible from its rhetorical ugliness.

"Frank Bidart is one, and from the little I've read of
Franz Wright he might be another.  Both these essays
are more than ten years old at this point, but they do
provide a way to talk about confessional that goes
beyond the binaries of I/not-I or
biographical/impersonal."

There's also an interesting little essay in the back
of Bidart and Gewanter's new Lowell Collected Poems,
called "On 'Confessional' Poetry."

Limiting the exposure of the experimental work by "writers of color" limits
our understanding of the cultures from which they come. Consider, for
example, how different our perception of African-American culture would be
if we had access to the naturalistic novels of Richard Wright but not to the
work of Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez and Ishmael Reed.  Consider the number
of people who still don't know about the work of Baraka, Sanchez and Reed,
and the way lack of access limits their perception of African-American
culture. As a person who listens to avant-garde jazz

not only by African-Americans but by Asian-Americans, as well as other
groups, I believe writers from their respective cultures are producing
experimental work that parallels the avant-garde jazz that comes out of the
cultures. I already know what "white American males" are producing.

I'd like to know more about experimental work coming out of other cultures.
The writers might show me something I haven't yet thought of that would be
rewarding to try.

Much respect to kari and George but that mosque bombardment is not the same
old same-old. True enough that as an act of imperial state violence it
takes its place in a long and putrid history -- a tradition, one might even
call it -- but its reception in the Muslim world is guaranteed to be as
utterly world-transforming as the reception of 9/11 was among the World
Trade community. So don't tell me my persisting astonishment is in bad
faith. You will see how things have become different from what they were. LRSN

Kazim, your point below is useful. One might add _My Life_ to _Border
Comedy_ along with some of Leslie Scalapino's work, some Baraka, even some
Forche (I think her new book is wonderful, by the way). So border-crossing
between "confessional" and "experimental" is not quiet as new as it may
seem. The confessional, like the "surreal" and the "experimental," have been
normalized, though one might also say that the work that attempts to
preserve "pure" (whatever that may be) confession, surreality,
experimentalism, etc., remain on the margins.

As my students have recently pointed out (in their response to the Yasusada
affair), the reader can never be sure whether a "confession" is sincere or
fictional, especially when there is no obligation on the part of the poet to
identify as one or the other. So it's probably more useful to look at
strategies that employ the confession (legal or Catholic) as a
formal/structural analogue than at sincerity if the term "confessional" is
to be of much use any more.

I wonder if there is other work out there of any branding that employs the
confession as a structural analogue without delving into the
autobiographical? Surely Cornelius Eady's _Brutal Imagination_, yes?

Of course "experimental" and "confessional" or as
Timothy Yu wrote it "I/not-I" don't really exist as
binaries in any meaningful way. For example I am
currently reading "A Border Comedy" by Lyn Hejinian
and finding it beautifully (and purposefully)
problematic on exactly these questions. In my mind
Susan Howe is exactly as (moreso) confesseional as any
"confessional" poet--of course I could be doing a
profound misreading of Howe, but read "The Midnight"
and see if you don't see what I mean.

contradictory. And despite the disparateness of styles and backgrounds and voices,
they've forged a community, a welcome counterpoint to an American poetic culture

Eileen - this is a sweetly measured response to "Mr. Whore & Crack". In my

I don't see her work as "all" pessimistic and/or "all" mystical, nor even a
balance between the two.  There is variation there.  Isn't this the case
with many poets?  We often sequey into new territory, remain there for a
bit, branch outward?

She is also intellectual at times, and I don't contend that intellectualism
necessarily breeds pessimism, although this might be true of some...

Unless I am deeply mistaken, the author of the above sentence is referring
to how we define "experimental." He is not suggesting that white men are
better writers than Filipino crack whores, but that we consider the works of
self-reflecting white men "experimental" and the works of self-reflecting
Filipino crack whores "confessional," thereby allowing us to categorize
non-white poor women as bad with a new, less offensive term; allowing us to
be racist, sexist, and classist without getting our semantics dirty.

Andrew, I hope you will correct me if I misunderstood your post.

If I did misunderstand Andrew's post, I would like to make the point for
myself. I know that Lowell was the first widely-regarded "confessionalist,"
but I have found that those who disrespect the term usually do so to degrade
"feminine" writings, and use different terms to describe male authors who
write in the same way. I do not find such soft-spoken misogyny preferable to
outright semantic ugliness.

speaking of neologisms, sequey is a gem. you have to wonder how much of
our language is actually a consequence of typos & misreadings.

I was the person who said the term "confessional" was no longer very
meaningful, which may be a form of disrespect for the term.  I hadn't
known that the term was worthy of respect, but if I hurt its feelings,
I apologize. I don't believe that I said or implied anything about
applying the term to "masculine" or "feminine" writing or authors.  Did
I miss the soft-spoken misogyny somewhere in my post or the posts of
those discussing the term?

On the other hand the outright rhetorical ugliness of the original post
using the subject heading above (which I have edited out of respect for
those of us who have seen it pop up in our inboxes more than enough
times already) I, too, found offensive, and share Maria Damon's horror,
disagreement, and wish for distance.

Then of course there's the fact that much of Lowell's work isn't
confessional.  _Life Studies_ was supposed to be a breakthrough book, and is
somewht autobiographical, but it has a lot of pieces which are about
Lowell's relatives and could have been about strangers.  It isn't all
intimate personal details.  The Lowell of "The Quaker Cemetery in Nantucket"
isn't autobiographical at all; there are other strong poems in the book
_Lord Weary's Castle_ (like "Adam and Eve") which are fictional narratives,
not autobiography.  On the other end of his career, the Lowell of _Notebook_
and the related books of sonnets  is more abstract and historical (if those
two contradictory qualiities can go together).  Then there is the fact that
some of Lowell's most so-called confessional poetry has a lot of the
universal in it, as demonstrated by titles such as "To Speak of Woe That is
in Marriage", "The Drinker", "Penelope" and so forth.

Why don't people call Williams confessional because he wrote a poem about
his English grandmother?  They call Lowell confessional for writing about
his Uncle Devereaux...

There are also poets who are experimental and confessional, like Geoffrey
Young, for example, or Lyn Heijinian...  Leslie Scalapino in "Dark Matter"
(is that the right title?) is fairly autobiographical, yet she's a "Language
Poet."  What about Carla Harryman?  Not a Language poet, but certainly
experimental.

Finally, there are male autobiographical poets (eg Martin Espada) who aren't
usually called confessional...

Millie

P.S. I can relate to many of Anne Sexton's issues but she had a whiny
poetical voice which uses cheap symbolism, like Father/Doctor as Hitler,
etc.

Sincere sympathy is good, of course , but why would you want a cultural

Dear Colleagues,

I pass along an urgent dispatch from Iraq. Those
of you who know Spanish can read it for
yourselves.  The gist of it is that a number of
urban population centers are under siege and
total enclosure, with bombardment from aircraft
and tanks, without water, electricity, or medical
facilities. Human cadavers are stacked in the
streets. The international press corps is
prohibited from entry, their cameras are being
smashed, and the siege looks to extend beyond the
immediate present. The author of the dispatch is
the local director of an international
organization (described below) under constant
harassment by the Occupation Authority. She is
calling for help. Any ideas on what we can do?

Sorry for x-postings.

Fwd: Fw: URGENTE desde Bagdad
Dear Colleagues,

I pass along an urgent dispatch from Iraq. Those of you who know
Spanish can read it for yourselves.  The gist of it is that a
number of urban population centers are under siege and total
enclosure, with bombardment from aircraft and tanks, without water,
electricity, or medical facilities. Human cadavers are stacked in the
streets. The international press corps is prohibited from entry, their
cameras are being smashed, and the siege looks to extend beyond the
immediate present. The author of the dispatch is the local director of
an international organization (described below) under constant
harassment by the Occupation Authority. She is calling for help. Any
ideas on what we can do?

Sorry for x-postings.

URGENTE desde
Bagdad
por jose • Tuesday April 06, 2004 at 04:14 PM

Iman Khamas, directora del centro del Observatorio de la
Ocupación en Bagdad ha remitido esta tarde el siguiente mensaje
sobre lo que está ocurriendo en las ciudades iraquíes.


Difundir

"Las ciudades iraquíes de Sadr,
Adamiya, Kufa, Falija, Shula y otras han sido cercadas y están
siendo bombardeadas por misiles y tanques de las fuerzas de
ocupación estadounidenses y sus aliados. La población civil está
siendo asesinada. La autopista a Faluja ha sido cerrada y las noticias
que llegan desde el interior de esta ciudad indican que yacen en las
calles cuerpos sin vida de muchas personas. No hay ambulancias, ni
agua ni electricidad. Los periodistas tienen prohibido el paso y
muchas de sus cámaras han sido rotas. Todo indica que esta
situación va a mantenerse durante los próximos días. Por favor,
ayuda"

Iman Khamas
Directora del Centro del Observatorio de la Ocupación en Bagdad
Bagdad, 6 de abril de 2004

--------------

Informaciones sobre la Sra. Khamas y el
Observatorio que dirige.

El Observatorio de la Ocupación e iniciativas
contra la represión

El
Observatorio de la Ocupación, una iniciativa impulsada en el
ámbito internacional pero que tiene en Iraq su propia dirección y
centro abierto en la capital, está tratando de impulsar con apoyo
exterior programas de evaluación de los efectos de la ocupación en
todos los sectores de la vida iraquí. A pesar de las dificultades
que imperan en Iraq, el Observatorio ha comenzado a poner en marcha
proyectos de investigación, bien estrictamente propios (por ejemplo
los relativos a la situación de los presos y presas detenidos por
las fuerzas de la ocupación y violaciones por éstas de los
derechos humanos [7]) o en colaboración con organizaciones
exteriores. Comprometidos en desarrollar una labor independiente, el
Observatorio sigue resistiéndose a acatar las órdenes de la APC,
según las cuales toda nueva organización iraquí -o extranjera,
si opera en Iraq- debe registrarse y presentar una documentación
exhaustiva así como sus proyectos, actividades y contactos con
terceras organizaciones internacionales.

El CSCA
mantuvo durante su estancia en Bagdad varias entrevistas con la
directora del Observatorio, Iman Khamas, con la que evaluó líneas
de apoyo desde el Estado español a esta iniciativa, en concreto
recabar apoyo económico para el mantenimiento del centro en Bagdad o
a áreas de intervención concretas, como las relativas a
violaciones de los derechos humanos por las autoridades de
ocupación, condiciones de detención o la evaluación de los
asesinatos selectivos de profesionales y científicos iraquíes
[8].

En esta
línea, la delegación del CSCA realizó una visita al suburbio de
Abu Ghraib, en el extrarradio de Bagdad y lugar donde la APC ha
ubicado, en la antigua prisión del depuesto régimen, un centro de
detención masiva en cuyas instalaciones pueden estar encarcelados en
condiciones pésimas hasta más de 40.000 personas [9]. El
CSCA tuvo la oportunidad de entrevistarse con algunos de los detenidos
y detenidas ya excarcelados para recabar de primera mano información
sobre la situación que se vive en el interior de la prisión. De
acuerdo con las denuncias de los excarcelados, las tropas
estadounidenses y la policía iraquí infringen violaciones de los
derechos humanos más básicos, que van desde la violación de las
mujeres detenidas o su exposición pública desnudas, hasta el
encarcelamiento de familias enteras de supuestos miembros de la
resistencia, a fin de obligar a éstos a entregarse. La cuestión de
las violaciones de mujeres se ha extendido a tal extremo que la
consideración general es que forma parte de una estrategia
premeditada de los ocupantes y de los nuevos cuerpos de seguridad
iraquíes para lograr la entrega inmediata de los huidos. El
Observatorio de la Ocupación ha dado cobertura a varias
investigaciones locales sobre el tema, e igualmente ha comenzado a
investigar esta cuestión registrando declaraciones de afectados y
afectadas: Esta podría ser una línea de colaboración a
desarrollar desde la CEOSI.

Asimismo,
se acordó que Khamas evaluará la posibilidad de apoyar desde el
Observatorio el programa de investigación sobre las consecuencias
sanitarias y ecológicas de la contaminación por uso de armamento
revestido con uranio empobrecido, para lo cual contactará con
personal sanitario que pudiera estar interesado en esta
iniciativa.

I wonder what you get when you search the Poetics archive for "weapons

Hello!

If you know of any place or hear of any place for rent or sublet, please let
me know. I would love a long-termish sublet alone in either Manhattan or
Brooklyn, but as Santa's next visit is way off and we ain't exactly on
speaking terms, I'm open to other things. You can contact me at
 leroy_years@hotmail.com

Thank you,
Renee Gladman

One Year Later - April 9, 2004
April 9, 2004
Today, the day the Iraqi Puppets hail "National Day", will mark the day of
the "Falloojeh Massacre"=8A Bremer has called for a truce and ceasefire in
Falloojeh very recently and claimed that the bombing will stop, but the
bombing continues as I write this. Over 300 are dead in Falloojeh and they
have taken to burying the dead in the town football field because they
aren't allowed near the cemetery. The bodies are decomposing in the heat an=
d
the people are struggling to bury them as quickly as they arrive. The
football field that once supported running, youthful feet and cheering fans
has turned into a mass grave holding men, women and children.
The people in Falloojeh have been trying to get the women and children out
of the town for the last 48 hours but all the roads out of the city are
closed by the Americans and refugees are being shot at and bombed on a
regular basis=8A we're watching the television and crying. The hospital is
overflowing with victims=8A those who have lost arms and legs=8A those who have
lost loved ones. There isn't enough medicine or bandages=8A what are the
Americans doing?! This is collective punishment =8A is this the solution to
the chaos we're living in? Is this the 'hearts and minds' part of the
campaign?=20
A convoy carrying food, medication, blood and doctors left for Falloojeh
yesterday, hoping to get in and help the people in there. Some people from
our neighborhood were gathering bags of flour and rice to take into the
town. E. and I rummaged the house from top to bottom and came up with a big
sack of flour, a couple of smaller bags of rice, a few kilos of assorted dr=
y
lentil, chickpeas, etc. We were really hoping the trucks could get through
to help out in the city. Unfortunately, I just spoke with an Iraqi doctor
who told me that the whole convoy was denied entry... it seems that now the=
y
are trying to get the women and children out or at least the very sick and
wounded.=20
The south isn't much better=8A the casualties are rising and there's looting
and chaos. There's an almost palpable anger in Baghdad. The faces are grim
and sad all at once and there's a feeling of helplessness that can't be
described in words. It's like being held under water and struggling for the
unattainable surface- seeing all this destruction and devastation.
Firdaws Square, the place where the statue was brought down, is off-limits
because the Americans fear angry mobs and demonstrations=8A but it doesn't
matter because people are sticking to their homes. The kids haven't been to
school for several days now and even the universities are empty. The
situation in Baghdad feels very unstable and the men in the neighborhood ar=
e
talking of a neighborhood watch again- just like the early days of
occupation.=20
Where are the useless Governing Council? Why isn't anyone condemning the
killings in the south and in Falloojeh?! Why aren't they sitting down that
fool Bremer and telling him that this is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong??? If
one of them were half a man or even half a human, they would threaten to
resign their posts if there isn't an immediate ceasefire=8A the people are
enraged. This latest situation proves that they aren't Iraqi- they aren't
here for the welfare of the Iraqi people.
The American and European news stations don't show the dying Iraqis=8A they
don't show the women and children bandaged and bleeding- the mother looking
for some sign of her son in the middle of a puddle of blood and dismembered
arms and legs=8A they don't show you the hospitals overflowing with the dead
and dying because they don't want to hurt American feelings=8A but people
*should* see it. You should see the price of your war and occupation- it's
unfair that the Americans are fighting a war thousands of kilometers from
home. They get their dead in neat, tidy caskets draped with a flag and we
have to gather and scrape our dead off of the floors and hope the American
shrapnel and bullets left enough to make a definite identification=8A
One year later, and Bush has achieved what he wanted- this day will go down
in history and in the memory of all Iraqis as one of the bloodiest days
ever...

Hi Christophe & all,

The latest issue of Boog City has an article (by Jane Sprague) which pretty
much documents the impetus/history behind Braincase Press, though it feels
sort of odd to say history as the press has yet to reach the one year mark.
Regardless, things are going well. There is a website:
http://braincasepress3.blogspot.com/ which in truth is a series of 5 blogs,
interlinked & sharing templates, so as to appear as a single website. The
first three chapbooks are sold out, but I think you might be able to get
copies from the authors themselves… if anyone wants their contact info just
b/c me…  There are copies of both
David Perry’s _new years_ & Jim Behrle’s _(purple) notebook of the lake_
currently available, though not fr long… See the website for ordering info.
Samples of Perry’s work can be found here:
http://www.dcpoetry.com/anth2003/perry.htm &
http://www.speakeasy.org/~subtext/poetry/davidperry/poem2.htm

Samples of Behrle’s here: http://jimmy.onepotmeal.com/archives/001833.html
What folks have said about it here:
http://www.onepotmeal.com/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1573

I’ve already got the next batch of 3 in the works & Eric Baus’ should be out
shortly. Thanks fr asking.

Oh & while I’m here… I should mention that my new chapbook _Jaywalking the
Is_ is now available from Margin to Margin Press
(http://www.litpress.com/margin/)

Thanks,

Noah

this conversation is again degrading- is it neccessary to accuse people of
racism, woman hating and alike? Does anyone think
that anyone on the Buffalo list is a racist? A woman hater? A homophobe? It
seems to me that we ought to assume that people here are earnest and are
trying to have a conversation with the other postees, and not throw bombs
that end discussion. If you are a woman hater, homophobe or racist I urge
you to get mental health help.

regarding the initial post which I posted on the pulitzer here is my
opinion, with poets like Rothenberg, Joris, Bernstein, Creeley, Hoover,
Ashbery, Notley, MacLow, Vicuna, Howe and on and on not winning how can they
give the prize to Franz Wright? Is his obra more deserving than these
others? Below are the winners for the past 17 years you tell me apart from a
few of these how many are innovative? How many are poets that make it new?

A Rolling Stone, 007 and a badly behaved man queue to buy bar propped up by
Dylan Thomas
By Louise Jury Arts Correspondent
09 April 2004

A new generation of celebrity "hellraisers" is vying to step into the seat
left vacant at the watering hole favoured by Dylan Thomas, the poet.

Brown's Hotel in Laugharne, west Wales, was where Thomas routinely supped a
half pint - or several - in the company of his wife, Caitlin. Tommy Watts,
72, the current landlord, who remembers drinking with him, has decided he is
too old to run the place and is selling up.

The Rolling Stone Mick Jagger, Neil Morrissey, the original man behaving
badly, and Pierce Brosnan, the James Bond star, have visited with a view to
bidding for a slice of literary history.

Thomas wrote many of his most famous works in a small, wooden boathouse that
was his study in Laugharne. The village and its inhabitants were the source
of Under Milk Wood, his play of many Welsh voices later recorded with
Richard Burton among the cast. The village of Laugharne is renamed
"Llareggub" and Brown's, which dates back to the 18th century, was, it has
been claimed, the inspiration for his verse.

Photographs of the poet crowd the walls in testament to the village's most
famous former resident, whose name has even persuaded the former American
presidents Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon to pay a visit. This memorabilia
will be included in the sale, for the right price.

With expressions of interest from as far afield as the United States, Canada
and Germany, the price is likely to exceed £500,000 when Terry Thomas, a
Carmarthen estate agent, opens bids on 21 April.

Mr Watts said yesterday that he hoped the new owner would treasure and
preserve the photographs. And he confirmed the rumours of interest from
Thomas's famous fans who have recently paid visits.

He saidBrosnan even named his son Dylan Thomas in tribute and already owns a
wooden double bed used by the poet when he stayed at Brown's in the 1930s
and 1940s.

Morrissey is considering the property as an extension to his existing
business portfolio. With Matt Roberts, his business partner, he owns two
premises - Hurst Hotel, a £125-a-night boutique hotel and restaurant, and a
pub called the New Three Mariners - within a mile of Brown's.

Mr Roberts said yesterday: "Neil and Hurst House are looking at Brown's. We
are currently in discussions with a number of interested and interesting
parties, including well-known actors and business people, as potential
investors."

Despite Thomas's hellraising reputation, bidders should be advised that
tales of bad behaviour at Brown's may be something of an exaggeration. Mr
Watts said Thomas drank half pints only in the bar, which lies near where he
was eventually buried. "We were quite pally like. He was a good man. You
shouldn't believe all they say about him," he said.

A lot of people think Thomas died an alcoholic, Mr Watts added, but it was
simply a medical failure to treat a diabetic coma. In the theory favoured by
the landlord, it was wrongly administered morphine that killed him.

some thoughts..

in my studies, my awareness, marginalization and experimental work often go
together. locked out of the mainstream? write anyway, but it doesn't usually
look/read/sound like the locking-out mainstream.

ex: late 60s/early 70s, beginning of huge amount of experimental writing by
women who were locked out, ignored, marginalized by their male poetic
counterparts. lots of white women, some women of color. (wish i knew more here.) women
began producing books, magazines, reading series, etc, putting more and more
experimental women into the public eye, redefining poetry, exploding it really,
opening a path for us all.


a position of privilege can lead to a lack of interest in experimenting, just
to keep things "safe." andrew's desire for tenure, for example, doesn't
strike me as a huge motivator to be cutting-edge, risk-taking, etc.


btw, must we refer to s.plath as part of her anatomy? THAT is passe.


the term confessionalism, btw, has been used to tidily bundle "women's
writing," and to throw this bundle into a trash heap.

"i" does not equal bad poetry. lack of "i" does not equal good poetry.

when i entered graduate school (96), i was told by one of my colleagues, "i
don't write about myself. i'm over that." or something to that effect. as if
the self were bad, dismissable. i was speechless. what to say to that, i
thought. EVERYTHING is about ourselves, or at least a reflection of ourselves, to do
with ourselves. we don't write, live in a vacuum. topic choice, word choice,
poetic structure, influences, output--it all comes from us, it's all ours. so
maybe everything is "confessional" in a sense. or maybe it's all not
confessional. or maybe it doesn't really matter whether it is or isn't.

why doesn't anyone label, dismiss, disregard frank o'hara as confessional?

glad to see some strong responses to andrew's post. sometimes i can't help
but wish more people had to take a women's studies class or two in college. i
don't know that it would "fix" anything, but a little enlightenment just might
go a long way...

btw, should anyone respond and i don't respond back, please don't take it
personally. i'm very past due, waiting for a baby that may show up at any time.
and, well, that's my top priority these days. btw, i remember reading recently
the sickening statement on this list about the only interesting birth being a
monstrous birth...this was incredibly stupid and ill-informed. all births are
interesting. everyone has a story. please stop degrading women on this list!
birth is a family event, yes, but it falls under the heading "women's issues"
that people love to sweep aside. boring, tiresome, and ignorant behavior.

with love from a card-carrying feminist,
jill

Why are you interpreting my sweeping statements about poetic classifications
as a personal attack? Is it for humor value? If so, rock on, so long as we
aren't pretending you're proving some sort of point, especially if the point
is:

That is your perogative, but it is strictly an aesthetic issue. You can be
offended, horrified, in disagreement and wishing for distance from the word
"cunt," but when the speaker is using the word to say something with which
you agree, you can't claim higher moral ground. Tackiness is not generally
regarded as a moral flaw.

I find it strange that voices somewhat dismissive of
confessional modes, are also those which don't know
what to do with polyvocal expression (see: sarcasm,
indeterminency, double voiced discourse, perhaps even
literal schizophrenia or madness). Don't know what to
do, that is, but react to the least interesting
aspects of a post which was designed not to offend but
provoke an interogation into some of the underlying
assumptions of the I/not-I debate.

OK, so for those troubled by my ugliness, here's
another stab at the can: One first needs a reasonably
stable coherent sense of self, that is in some way,
however provisionally, one's OWN, before one can go
about deterritorializing, de-stabilizing, dispersing
subjectivities and whatever other buzzwords supplant
material politics with poetic ones. There are politics
at work here but not the politics you think.

Finally, this forum can be an intelligent and
interesting place for dialogue and I hadn't intended
my post detract from that.

so, I took the whole "Sylvia Plath's author-function is a stupid passe cunt"
to be sarcastic. Meant in jest. i do imagine that these kinds of jests will
offend, and don't mean to invalidate those offended, but, it was a joke, right?

and in response to the last article of Andrew's (may I call you Andrew's?)
now controversial post, i don't think PROPER experimentation relies on anything
resembling any kind of institution like a library or a school or a certain
social environment, but on the state of mind (soul, body) of the one
experimenting. As in, it can happen anytime anywhere to anyone who is open to it and is
thoroughly okay with expressing themselves in terms not previously used to
express stuff before even if they are not aware of the fact that the mode of
expression used has not previously been employed. like run-on sentences, for
instance. ugh. And this means that indeed a library, school or certain social
environment may be involved, but that it is, and is not, beside the point entirely.
or, in short, experimentation happens. and will happen. whether we talk about
it or not, and whether or not we decide what circumstances it will happen
under.

I think most of us gravitate to some kind of locatable
self behind the voices we engage with (tho you won’t
find one here, I’m too serious), and so one great
thing about being an academic is you can get to meet
this Charles Bernstein fellow in the flesh, or at
least go on-line and see a picture of him holding his
child, perhaps even spend hours upon hours reading his
poetry, thus getting to know the man’s work, if not
the man or his life. In my view, this shouldn’t be a
privilege, but a right. Everyone should be able to
read difficult poetry, as far as I’m concerned , but
sadly my view is but one among many. Lots of folks
have smellier fish to fry.

I am just wondering if the appreciation of certain
modes of poetry over others can ever be totally free
of class-based distinctions. I confess, for instance,
that most Cowboy Poetry that I’ve read is really bad
stuff. This does not mean all cowboys are bad poets,
nor are they lesser forms of life. It just means their
concerns which are, of course, indistinguishable from
their mode of expressing them, are different than
mine. Maybe because I read more books and have more
education? Oh suffer the day I would ever presume such
a thing. What’s that, Jackson Mac Low self-identifies
as a cowboy you say? Well yes, I say, that’s precisely
my point.

Alright you rootintootin rustlers, please tell me what
exactly what my point is , one more time.

this reminds me of a comment rosmarie waldrop made in

a semi-confessional mode because she was writing all
these poems about her very strong-willed mother--in
order to these she decided to write a poem using only
the first lines of books pulled randomly for her book
shelf--unfortunately for her the resulting poem was
"still about my mother"

Ashbery won the Pulitzer, the National Book Award, and the National Book

Frost Medal, the Wallace Stevens Award, etc.  He has won so many awards that
his publisher has quit trying to fit them all on the jackets of his books.

As for the others you mention -- they are all talented artists and a couple
of them have been very influential.  They deserve to win everything in sight,
plus free lunches for the rest of their lives.  So are many other artists who
may or may not share a particular aesthetic.  I'm not that familiar with Mr.
Wright's work, but I assume he is well respected by many fairly intelligent p
eople.  Certainly he is now.

It's also possible that the current world situation is moving judges away
from academic/formalist writing and toward a more "humanist" voice.  I have no
idea at the moment whether or not this applies to the choice of Wright.  I'm
guessing.  Probably wrong.

Writing Through
Translations and Variations

Jerome Rothenberg

with a Foreword by Charles Bernstein

=20

"Any book from a poet as eminent as Jerome Rothenberg is significant and =
welcome. This is particularly valuable in bringing together in a =
convenient single volume Rothenberg's scattered translations and related =
variations. In a broader cultural context the book will be of great =
significance to students and readers of ethnopoetics, 20th century =
avant-garde and modernist texts in translation." - Steve McCaffery, =
Director, North American Centre for Interdisciplinary Poetics

=20

Wide-ranging poetry anthology by one of America's most distinguished =
literary translators.

Jerome Rothenberg is one of the major poets of his generation. His work =
in ethnopoetics, Native American and tribal poetics, Jewish identities, =
avant-garde poetry, and experimental translation is vital to =
contemporary poetry and literary studies. Writing Through couples =
Rothenberg's translations from a variety of non-English sources with his =
thought-provoking commentary. It also includes a selection of his poetry =
("Otherings & Variations") in which the language of significant others =
forms the basis of original compositions. The result is a lively and =
unique anthology which illustrates how poetry, like translation, can be =
viewed as an act of "writing through" the words of others.

Translated poets in Writing Through include Celan, Lorca, Nezval, =
Schwitters, Picasso and Gomringer. The book also includes Rothenberg's =
radical translations from oral poetries, "variations" derived from the =
vocabularies of translated poems, and a series of "gematria poems" =
employing a traditional form of Jewish numerology. In addition to =
Rothenberg's groundbreaking essay on "total translation," the book is =
interspersed with his helpful commentaries and notes, which illuminate a =
major aspect of his total poetics.

=20

"This is translation taken as a poet's act of opening-of oneself to =

Hi, Jill, and All--

(Jill: if you're reading and not yet birthing!--and in any case, I'm sending
my best wishes to you on that hard work of birthing, having gone that way 3
times meself, happy to say)--

Thanks for taking the time to explain and clarify [yet again, why is this
always such a necessity: it should not have to be so!] this reasonable
perspective.

I'm writing this to add my concern, coming from my "I/not I" voice(s), to
the rest of the ones saying as you say, Jill, "stop degrading women on this
list!"

Here are some thoughts from an rhetorical-analytical perspective: the
repeating derogatory subject line is rhetorically a matter for more question
because it has an effect that mimics what could be called a mini form of
shock-advertising, or shock-jock-speak.  As such, the subject line is loaded
like a weapon (whether intended or no, that effect still occurs) with
inflammatory content that echoes as would, say, a Warhol-effect in art, but
instead of blasting out a masked subconsciousness of privilege, it turns
viscious, repeating the same, instead of radicalizing the
consciousness--here, in terms of gendered violence. The O'Hara analogy is a
good one: no one would ever think to apply such to O'Hara: that is
unthinkable.  Why should the Plath subject line even be thinkable?  That had
nothing to do with her poetry and everything to do with how her gendering is
perceived.  The damage is more than offensive to a personal sense of "I"
when one identifies as a woman, and it should offend everyone, not only
those who identify that way because it is violent.  But it also offends and
undermines the possibilities for reasonable discourse because it is
polemical and repeated.  Due to the repetition, the violence and offense act
by chipping away bit by bit at the possibility for making reasonable talk as
it works by marginalizing, by yielding ridiculousness (literal sense) and
silence rather than meaningfulness and reasonable trust between rhetorical
participants. While the production of meaning is not always a desired
effect, in this case it seems essential to working out paths of inquiry
about the original topic at hand (which was how to be an "I" or a "not I"
and to explore all possible options).

Polemic will draw more of the same: divisive polemical fire. For some, that
is entertaining and actually moves discourse along energetically.  But
another effect is that discussion is forcibly digressive.  It is turned away
from the topic at hand in order that some participants defend their very
right to speak; or for some it causes an endless attempt to resolve newly
created conflicts as well as the blaming that all flare over the polemical
matter.  It is almost always about inflexible kinds of naming--name
calling--and unquestioned or monumentalized exclusionary categories of
definition.  There are rhetorical means and modes that work better than this
for discussion.  But I guess that then raises the question of goals: what is
it we want out of a given discussion?

But here is my main point: in this instance what had to be put aside as soon
as the polemical subject line was introduced were some valuable
comments--especially those early in the discussion coming from Brian
Clements and Tim Yu--put aside, that is, in order yet again to hash out a
derogatory matter of polemical naming and categorizing, rather than
continuing that fair-minded inquiry and discussion of where the "I/not I"
positions of enunciation might be thought manifest in poetics right now.

It seems too ironic that this has occured over what started as talk meant to
dialogue over *positions of enunciation*, no?  Alas.

Me?--I'd like to hear more, in the lively dialogic way that lists are good
for, about that fair-minded inquiry into the "I/not I".  Thanks.

Best Wishes,

Chris Murray

Hmm. Perhaps transparency isn’t so much impossible as
next to impossible. That is, in-between. Everything.

Anyhow, I’ve been duly rebuffed for straying outside
the confines of official Buf Po discussion culture
(replete with poets dropping little 1 and 2k bombs of
vitriol in my mailbox). Further, I’ve been talking
about my recent lispserv forays with a friend. She’s
suggested I needn’t grapple (my) shame to my tongue
with hoops of barbed wire. Translation: don’t be such
an asshole. Have some respect (especially b/c no one's
gonna give you the benefit of any doubts).

Thus, I shall defer to one of the grand old men of the
avant-garde, who here as elsewhere is indisputably
fair-minded and sure to raise few hackles:

Ron Silliman has written: "Progressive poets who
identify as members of groups that have been the
subject of history--many white male heterosexuals, for
example--are apt to challenge all that is supposedly
'natural' about the formation of their own
subjectivity. That their writing today is apt to call
into question, if not actually explode, such
conventions as narrative, persona and even reference
can hardly be surprising. At the other end of the
spectrum are poets who do not identity as members of
groups that have been the subject of history, for they
instead have been its objects. The narrative of
history has led not to their self-actualization, but
to their exclusion and domination. These writers and
readers--women, people of color, sexual minorities,
the entire spectrum of the 'marginal'--have a manifest
political need to have their stories told. ***That
their writing should often appear much more
conventional, with the notable difference as to who is
the subject of these conventions, illuminates the
relationship between form and audience.***"

Subject:      "Degrading" the conversation
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I hope that I am mistaken in thinking that Ray Bianchi is charging me
(I assume he means me, since it's my email that's attached to his
post) with with "degrading" the conversation on the list through my
critique of Andrew Loewen's post on "Sylvia Plath's author-function."
I don't think it's at all fair for Ray to accuse me of simplistic
charges of "racism, woman hating and alike," or of  "throw[ing]
bombs" to end discussion; I thought Loewen threw a bomb and I was
trying to jump on it, or something.  Last time I checked, this was a
community of poets, people above all hypersensitive to language and
its uses.  I tried to provide a reading of Loewen's post which
explained my response to and criticism of it, not simply cry "racism"
and "sexism" against someone I wanted to shut up.  Chris Murray's
post, among others, was a fine example of a smart and reasoned
critique that committed itself to dialogue, without in any way
pulling its punches, and I hope that what I wrote was in the same
spirit.

I'm also disappointed with Loewen's subsequent post, which rather
condescendingly suggests that those who have criticized him just
"don't know what to do with polyvocal expression"--in other words,
that we just didn't get the joke.   Well, for Loewen or anyone else
who is interested, I've put up a more extensive critique of Loewen's
initial post up at my blog, address below.  That I should have to
demonstrate my own critical abilities in this way is itself a little
degrading--but more on that later.

For whatever reason, Loewen also seems to categorize me and his other
critics among those who dismiss confessional modes.  I had hoped that
my post citing the Middlebrook essay on confessionalism would suggest
instead that confessionalism has to be understood as a historical
mode--one that happened at a certain time, and that's perhaps best
characterized by a grounding in/obsession with psychoanalysis and
family dynamics--rather than as a blanket term for poetry that in
some way addresses biography or the self.  To essentialize
"confessionalism" in this latter way really doesn't make it that
useful as a term--hence the perfectly legitimate questions like
"isn't Williams confessional? isn't Dickinson confessional?"--nor
does it help us understand the way a lot of contemporary poetry, all
across the spectrum, reacts against what the confessional was
understood to be.  It also leads to setting up the "experimental" as
the opposite of poetry that address the self--as a pure anti-self
poetry--which is hardly more useful.

A final twist: Andrew Loewen said he wanted to draw attention to the
fact that white men claim a monopoly over complex writing, while
women and minorities are consigned to the simplistic.  Now, both he
and Ray Bianchi claim to be readers who can appreciate complexity and
subtlety, while those who have criticized Loewen's post--for the most
part, women or minorities--are guilty of simplistic thinking and an
inability to read well.   Okay, Andrew: I guess you were right.

  I have not followed this entire drama suffering from the flu... and a
raging temperature... but using this quote of Ron's is a weak argument
besides being a gross generalization, which should raise some red
flags..

  what is happing here is not so much that they are
"apt to challenge all that is supposedly
> 'natural' about the formation of their own

but that is goes completely unexamined and unchallenged-.. all from a
privileged perspective of never having to explore an assumed position
of power of dominance

and it could be true that they

especially since there is little questioning of their postion.

with all due respect to Ron Silliman  (who I have the deepest
respect).. I hardly think of Ron as a grande of man...  and applying
the adjective to Ron means nothing then another diety to bow down to...
Ron's a person with "some" power..
this is all over simplified out of context biased rewriting of history
by someone who is in a position to do so.........

gosh, there is sure a lot of other people's words and ideas being flung
around these parts here, and then a lot of reaction to these people's ideas. how
about some nice fresh stuff that is totally just all "we are writers writing
stuff and here is my experience and here is yours and let's compare."

how about someone talking to me about the fact that individual characters are
hard to deal with, while sets of people are pieces of cake.

how about someone talking to me about the general integration.

how about we don't mention a name for like forty posts and see how it goes.
we'll all just be our words and ideas, and then, after we suss this stuff
out, we can integrate it into the greater social construct that is so important
to us all. and then we'll all be like, "hey, cool."

ron's statement has been much contested, by, for example, the
existence of journals like Xcp:Cross-Cultural Poetics, conferences
like Cross-Cultural Poetics and the upcoming Diasporic Avant-gardes,
folks like Mark Nowak, Amiri Baraka, etc.  With all due respect to
Ron, quoting an eminence grise does not a factoid make.

wait a minute, folks...

quoting ron silliman or quoting anyone doesn't get anyone off the hook, but---

if i were to argue that the avant-garde is still dominated---both in
terms of perceptions and in terms of access to power---by white male
heterosexuals, would anyone object?... i understand we're all a lot
smarter today re avant-garde formations... we know, that is, that
they're far more various than some of us might have thought they
were, both formally and in terms of who is writing what, and this is
thanks to the work of people on this list (among others)...

but---and this is not a question directed at formal matters
exactly---is there a residual white male het power still at work in
avant-garde formations, a power that obscures the work of women,
people of color, ethnic minorities, transgendered people etc.?...
again, nothing to do with confessional modes and the like---i'm
talking institutional power, as it's played out in specific
institutional settings...

my sense is that one could yet make an argument that avant-garde
formations (not forms, again) are still shaped to a greater degree
than they should be by the social and cultural power of white male
hets (& please understand---i'm not trying to "empower" my white male
het self by saying so!)...

obviously it would take some care to unpack this reality, if it be a
reality... pardon the obvious, in any case, i just thought we might
not want to gloss over what could be an important issue... perhaps,
too, i haven't been listening as carefully as i might... my sinuses
are killing me this morning...

best,

Stephen Ellis has a neat and interesting article about Lisa Jarnot's
pamphlet LANGUAGE in House Organ, #45. In particular, he sets her work in
its context, as part of Charles' Olson's Curriculum of the Soul, taken
over as the Institute for Further Studies, cared for by Albert Glover,
Fred Wah, Duncan McNaughton, Stephen Rodefer all of them still alive and
actively publishing.


The studies were mimeographed in ragged improvisational appearances,as
Ellis rightly points out. (One issue came out with a bit of fur attached
for further studies.)

Ellis evokes a whole on going period.

The American Book Review has reviewed "Experimental Theology," the Seattle
Research Institute's Public Text 0.2.  This is anthology of essays,
fiction, poetry, and theoretical confabulations on or about religion and
theology, which I edited, and was published last June.

A link for ABR is

http://www.litline.org/ABR/issues/Volume25/Issue3/253.html

Unfortunately, ABR does not (seemingly) put there issues online, so you
have to find a copy to read the review.  My only comment is Megan Purn,
who designed "Experimental Theology," is not a "doctrinaire
postmodernist."  She is a very good designer.

And, of course, there are copies of "Experimental Theology" still
available.  Please go to www.seattleresearchinstitute.org for more
information or email info@seattleresearchinstitute.org.

thanks,
Robert

I don't have any Black Sparrow Press contact info, but the following
might be helpful. According to University of Alberta's Black Sparrow
Press archive:

In May, 2002, Martin closed up shop, selling the rights to his premier
authors (Bukowski, Bowles, and Fante) to HarperCollins; the Wyndam Lewis
titles went to Ginkgo Press in Corte Madera, while the balance of the
list was purchased by Boston publisher Charles Godine.

For those interested, a (very good) bibliography for U of A's Black
Sparrow Press archive is available at:

I think a quick glance at Publisher's Weekly lends enormous support to this
theory.

And, if the theory is correct, what can be done about it?

(Will begin by suggesting removing words from the dictionary will not help.)

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Ron Silliman's statement on the differences between the poetry of the
"subjects" and "objects" of history is certainly relevant to this
discussion.  My own response to his claim (made, incidentally, in
1988, in the essay "Poetry and the Politics of the Subject" and
reprinted in _The New Sentence_) has always been that if we
understand it as a *descriptive* statement--that is, as a historical
account of how writers from different social positions have been
positioned in the field of contemporary writing, with different
functions and values assigned to their work by readers and
critics--then the statement has a lot of truth to it, even if it
describes a state of affairs (as Joe Amato suggests) that we might
not be too happy with.  But if it is read as a *prescriptive*
statement--as a claim that non-straight white male writers don't,
can't, or shouldn't write poetry that goes beyond the "conventional"
forms of narrative and autobiography--then the statement becomes, as
Nathaniel Mackey has put it, "part of the problem," reinforcing the
same binary it seeks to describe.

I should also note that I don't think Silliman believes he is
devaluing "conventional" writing by women, racial minorities, and
gays and lesbians, since he wishes to award such work the label of
"progressive poetry," alongside work that he would describe as
deconstructing subjectivity.  For many readers, though, this still
sounds far too paternalistic and restrictive.

Aldon Nielsen's quite right that a number of people have discussed
Silliman's statement critically.  These include Nathaniel Mackey in
_Discrepant Engagement_ (p. 18-19), who argues that "experimental
writing...is not the domain solely of those from socially
nonmarginalized groups"; Bob Perelman in _The Marginalization of
Poetry_, p. 172-3 (which quotes Leslie Scalapino's critique of
Silliman's "authoritarian" schema"); Rae Armantrout (in several
places on this topic, but particularly in "Feminist Poetics and the
Meaning of Clarity," _Sagetrieb_ 11.3 [1992], which wonders whether
"the nature of women's oppression can be expressed in the poem
which...'looks conventional'"); and, well, me ("Form and Identity in
Language Poetry and Asian American Poetry," _Contemporary Literature_
41.3 [2000]).  I'm sure there are others that I'm missing.

In a 2000 interview [http://home.jps.net/~nada/silliman.htm],
Silliman himself suggests that while the field he described in 1988
has changed somewhat, "the general dynamics roughed out in that piece
still apply," though he notes the rise of significant numbers of
Asian American experimental writers and praises Mackey and Nielsen,
among others, for their efforts to "resurrect a progressive black
modernist heritage."

I think the best response to Silliman's schema, though, has been by
Harryette Mullen, who has related the reception of her own
work--sometimes read through African American literary paradigms,
sometimes through "experimental" ones; she notes in "Poetry and
Identity" (_Telling It Slant_, ed. Mark Wallace and Steven Marks)
that "The assumption remains, however unexamined, that 'avant-garde'
poetry is not 'black' and that 'black' poetry, however singular its
'voice,' is not 'formally innovative.'"  My understanding of her
position is that she thinks Silliman has been helpful in pointing out
how these kinds of exclusionary dynamics can work, even as she seeks
in her own work to challenge those very dynamics.

Thanks for an interesting and thought-provoking post!  Everything I can
think of to say about it seems to need to be unsaid right afterwards,
though.  Thinking about race and to a lesser extent sexual orientation or
gender is kind of like walking through a minefield where one always risks
beig offensive if one goes with gut reactions.  Probably we are all racist
to some extent on a gut level (whatever race we belong to) because gut level
reactions come from what one picks up subliminally, and there is a lot of
subliminal racism.  So if I offend anyone, please knwo that I don't mean to
and am trying to get out a few reactions honestly.

I don't think that women or blacks or gays or whatever have to write non
experimentally. Indeed there are quite a few of "us" (me being at least a
woman) who are technically innovative.  However, when you see _yourself_ as
primarily a marginalized person rather than just a poet, there is a tendency
to be less experimental and (maybe) less creative.  Not because there CAN'T
be great literature about fighting injustice, but because it has been done
so many times in a less than artistic way.  It is so easy to be a cliche
when one is writing against racism or sexism or homophobia.  But so-called
marginalized peoples can write any way they want if they see themselves as
poets tout court rather than as X Poets (for any value of X).  This is kind
of an unfair situation, because white poets aren't encouraged by anyone to
think of themselves as White Poets, and so don't have to resist the
temptation.  It's asymmetric clearly because the very idea of White Poetry
sounds like it would have to be some kind of apartheid racist thing, whereas
Black Poetry is an acceptable label, at least to some poets.

Some black poets seem to have works that are "blacker" and other works that
are more experimental.  This is true of Thylias Moss, less true of Haryette
Mullen but still somewhat true.  But even saying that is to imply that
experimental work isn't black, which is a racist idea, probably.  Anyway,
some very classic black writers were pretty experimental, like Aime Cesaire
(who is much less experimental in translation than in French).

Another factor may be that if one is writing against oppression one may want
to be understood by the people one is trying to free.  But this idea implies
that the oppressed peoples aren't sophisticated readers, which may be
offensive.  But it is probably true that if youo are oppressed you are less
likely to have been to graduate schools of poetics...

Then there is the possibility that people who are oppressed write in
mainstream forms because they are trying to be acepted by the mainstream
literary circles.  However, these days I don't think mainstream poetic
circles are mainstream in style, exactly. I mean, isn't John Ashbery
mainstream?  I get the impression that postmodern is the accepted norm in
academic circles, anyway.

Most white guys who write poetry write conventional stuff that doesn't
challenge anything, least of all identity. Maybe we should send them a letter.

Or maybe what appears to be a 16 year old poorly-considered statement
should simply be forgotten, no matter who wrote it. Even very smart people
are entitled to the sins of their youth (or even of their old age).

A thought for the season: somewhere there's a stash of sayings by Jesus
that were simply too dumb to include in anybody's gospel.

Let Us Cannot

In our grief and anger
we have found our mission:
They hate our freedoms.
We must be vigilant.
Killing is a way of life for Afghans.
It's unfortunate, but we cannot
avoid civilian casualties.
We cannot tolerate
anti-American sentiments.
We cannot hope diplomacy
will work.  Now that we've
started bombing, we
should see it through to the end.
We have to show our patriotism.
It's kill or be killed.
They hate our freedoms.
This is the world’s fight.

Poetics and Public Culture in Canada: A Conference in Honour of Frank Davey
March 3-5, 2005
University of Western Ontario
London, ON, Canada


'Hey, what are you doing?'
she said, and he said
'I'm just standing here
being a Canadian'
     and she said 'Wow
      is that really feasible?'
and he said 'Yes
but it requires plenty
of imagination.'

      "Public Poem for Manitoulin Island Canada Day"
used with the kind permission of Lionel Kearns

In recent decades, Canadian poets and critics have passionately debated
questions of the nation, indigeneity, race and representation, asking what
it
means to make culture in the shadow of the culture industries. From at
least F.
R. Scott's "The Canadian Authors Meet" to vibrant contemporary spoken word
movements, Canadian poets have made the connection between poetics and
politics. Yet the roles of the poet in relation to public culture in a time
variously described as postnational, globalized, diasporic, hypercapitalist
have not yet been fully explored. Is this indeed a "time of Empire" -
either
literally, or metaphorically in the various understandings of Samir Amin,
Stuart Hall, Toni Negri and Michael Hardt, and others? What are the ways in
which poetics and public culture are mutually implicated? How has the
history
of poetics in Canada helped shape the present moment?

We encourage proposals for individual papers or panels representing a wide
variety of critical and creative perspectives. Graduate students are
strongly
encouraged to submit. Possible topics include (but are not limited to):

. How does Canadian poetics engage with global culture and the
globalization  of
culture?
. Have the relationships between poetics, culture, and empire altered in
ways
yet untheorized? What is the position of poetics in these discussions?
. How does poetics incorporate, challenge, and test the limits of the
visual?
. Has the viability of modes such as the lyric, narrative, and realism
changed
in recent years?
. How have minority poetries harnessed the tactics of avant-garde
aesthetics?
. What are the effects of new technologies on small press production,
copyright,
and reading publics?
. What are the roles of "old" technologies such as radio and open mic
stages in
creating communities animated by poetry and poetics?
. What is the future of the poetics of liberation and decolonization in
Canada?
. How does Canadian poetics negotiate multi-lingual concerns?

Discussions of these and related questions have happened on the street and
on
electronic listservs, in living rooms and in classrooms across the country.
It
is time to bring together these conversations in a broad academic and
public
forum which builds on the diversity and energy of Canadian poetics. The
conference will honour Frank Davey, the University of Western Ontario's
first
Carl F. Klinck Professor of Canadian Literature, former Professor at York
University and one of Canada's foremost poets and literary and cultural
theorists, on the occasion of his retirement.

Confirmed readers and speakers include Charles Bernstein, Lynette Hunter,
Smaro
Kamboureli, Lenore Keeshig-Tobias, Daphne Marlatt, M. NourbeSe Philip, and
Fred
Wah.

Potential participants are asked to submit:
1)a 500-word proposal, stating the significance of the paper and its
relevance
to the call for papers
2)a 100-word abstract
3)a bibliography and 50-word biographical statement

Please submit an electronic copy of the proposal by e-mail, in addition to
three
hard copies by regular mail by August 15, 2004. Author's name must not
appear
on the proposal. Papers should be between 15 and 20 minutes in length.

Please send proposals and inquiries to:

In the heat of the day's news, I'm taken to remember that the proposal to
eliminate Hussein, invading Iraq and installing a "democratic government"
was undoubtedly described as "innovative thinking" or a "radical experiment"
in nation building by its neo-con think tank progenitors.
I suggest it's best to discuss "innovation" in terms of the value of its
results (here in poems), rather that going "rooty-toot, toot, we're the
innovative boys from the institute" (in political terms sub: Heritage,
American Enterprise, New American Century, Hoover, etc.). In and of itself
innovation, poetic or otherwise, does not, so to speak, reveal "the silver
bullet."  Whatever the syntactical intervention - and how its operationally
viewed - the critical act of reading still has to determine whether the work
"makes it" or not, as well what constitutes "making it.". Or, going back to
the current Iraq political reference, whether or not the innovation is a
total disaster with very painful consequences for the collective (including
genders and multiple colors).
If so, as sometimes happens, the conventional forms become radically
counter-innovative, as say with the best of hip-hop's undercutting edges
with the added consequence of being populist. Yet, alternatively, I still
have a tough time cottoning to Marilyn Hacker's end rhymes en perpetua  -
albeit her mind and spirit seems to be in the right place.  (Indeed back in
15th century or so, my understanding is that the use of rhymes was
considered "barbaric" - an oral literature, i.e. lower class, throwback -
and a threat to the Latin based powers and poetry that be. So was the case
then that rhyme constituted a radical and innovative attack on the court
powers and in-house poets. Yeah rhyme!)

To keep making little leaps here, I always find interesting the division in
Kenneth Rexroth's worksas he switches form a twenties cubist experimentalist
to a a  populist writer and his language becomes totally transparent,
luminous - and quite beautiful and sustaining without engaging much play in
determining the artifice. Suspect it was a function of the politics and the
times - the thirties into the fifties - and the desire to be recognized as a
citizen voice in a rotten time. The lure of experimentation always runs and
carries the risk of either a Mandarin mantle, or, for the publicly inclined,
the dread of obscurity, or, optimistically, the work will enter the
literature at a later time and be of great significance in a utopian future
of understanding readers.

Hope I haven't overstated anybody's sense of 'the obvious', or, how did C
Rice characterize the information in August 6 memo about Ben Laden's
intended threats on the US - unlike her I hope what is said here is not just
dismissed as "historical."  I suspect the Bush gang - in light of all the
failures in Iraq - will eventually end up dismissing their responsibility
for this disaster as merely "historical" and to be forgotten. Hind-sight
accrues no responsibility.

I like this thread!

Dear Friends of Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com

I am assured by my hosting company that tomorrow chicagopostmodernpoetry.com
will be live I wanted to send to you all,a list of friends and poets I
admire a preview of the site and also invite all of you to please send,
reviews, notices of your readings, notices of publications and alike to my
personal email. I created this site with poets like yourselves in mind and I
am here to facilitate your poetic aims in our little corner of the country.
Below is an explanation of the site and I hope that tomorrow when it is live
you will visit it and use it often to find out what is happening in the
Innovative Poetry scene in Chicago and the Midwest.

chicagopostmodernpoetry.com

Our Aesthetic

Chicago Postmodern Poetry.com does have an aesthetic firmly rooted for lack
of a better term in the innovative 'avant garde' tradition that begins in
the last century with a varied group of writers, Pound, French Poetry, Latin
American Poetry, Italian Poetry, Russian Poetry, Williams, Olson, Black
Mountain, Rothenberg, Ginzburg, Creeley, Stein, Zukovsky, HD, and moves
through Language Poetry, The New York School, and Ethnopoetics to our
present Postmodern, Post-Language moment.  The great poets of the Postmodern
generation, Bernstein, Antin, Palmer, Hoover, DuPlessis, Mayer, Joris, and
younger voices Gizzi, Jarnot, Willis, Clements, Hofer, Daly, and many others
are showing us the way toward a new poetics that is rooted in the sense of
making things new we will celebrate them here unapologetically.

Poetic Profiles/Chicago Poetic Profiles

Monthly we will be profiling a local Chicago/Midwest and a National poet on
this site, our first profile; Catherine Daly, is live now on the site and
she is a friend of Chicago Post Modern Poetry.com and we are in her debt for
being the first to submit to a Poetic Profile. In future months we will be
profiling Jen Hofer, who is an innovative poet in her own right and is
arguably the best translator of Mexican poetry working today in the US as
was shown in her new anthology Sin Puertas Visibles. We will also be
profiling; Kari Edwards, Charles Bernstein, Peter Gizzi, and many others.

CPMP will also be profiling Chicago's own local innovative poets. Chicago is
a city where much is going on poetically, poets such as Jesse Seldess, John
Tipton, Kerri Sonnenberg, Dan Beachy-Quick, William Fuller, Mark Tardi, Eric
Elstein, Matthias Regan, Peter O'Leary, Chuck Stebelston, Simone Muench,
Garin Gycholl, William Allegrezza, and many others make Chicago one of the
best places to be an innovative poet. CPMP has many poets to profile from
our own backyard and I am committed to promoting their work and this site
exists for them.

Our Choices

CPMP is also committed to helping younger and local poets survive as poets.
The desire to do this has led to some choices, we will not print poems here
except as part of reviews. If you love a poet please buy his/her books and
support our art form.

CPMP wants you to visit poet's websites and buy small press literary
magazines and chap books please put your money where your passion is located
have one less coffee and buy poetry books.

This site does not list every poetry event in the Chicago Region, there are
many great general poetry sites and I urge you to see the links that I have
on this site to visit them as well for more general events.

The Community

CPMP is a site open to the community, if you want to write a review of a
book or reading series please feel free to do so and submit it to us we will
publish it provided that it meets two criteria, it is well written and it
does not include any personal attacks on poets or others. Secondly book
reviews are always welcomed and encouraged.  Also if you have suggestions
send them as well and we will make changes if they are warranted. In the end
CPMP exists to support the great Innovative poetic institutions in Chicago
and cities nearby I want to thank in advance the following people who made
this site possible, William Allegrezza, (Indiana University NW) , Kerri
Sonnenberg (Discrete Series), Jesse Seldess (Discrete Series), John Beer
(Danny's Series), Joel Craig (Danny's Series) John Tipton (Chicago Poetry
Project), Chuck Stebelston (Myopic Series) and to Waltraud Haas, my wife,
who designed the site; I am forever and always in your debt for so much of
which this website but a grain of sand on a long Brazilian beach.

I just think we ought to tone it down and reason together- the minute we
throw around incendiary words and this goes for everyone we can no longer
reason because we are defending ourselves rather than discussing- I did not
call you Tim a Racist which would be stupid since I know you and respect you
totally.

Ronald Reagan of all people said something that I think is important
"someone who agrees with me 80% of the time is not my 20% enemy he is my 80%
friend" and I think sometimes we all forget this.

Okay, I am reading this whole thread with interest, not knowing quite how to
enter the discussion either here or even in my own private thinking!
        I did read the  below and one thing that felt important to note came
to mind.

The issue of identity becomes problematic as soon as we have names with
which to label people.  Names imply division, as do words, from the object
(at least according to much post structural linguistic theory) or in the
case of marginalized positions from what is thought of as "standard human"
without variation of race/gender/orientation/// blah blah blah....  Of
course names can be a place of empowerment, claiming "identity" in a way
that feels like a politically necessary move (read strategic essentialism)
    And the power of naming also comes with the limits of definitions, often
insufficient to any given person/work.
    Those very labels of course also act as a means of subcategorizing
people/writing from the main body of people/writing, as if the appended
adjectives somehow limit the person/work considered.


How can a work, by a "black author" (I am "white" as I write this) be
"blacker" than other works?  Are some of my works "whiter" than others, and
are some of them "more female?" or more straight/gay/het/bi/trans? (again
apologies to all at the very lumping of those positions)

If I write a work 'about' an abortion, is it "more female" than a work
'about' say, wanting to stop the war in the Middle East, or a Picasso
painting, or a purely formal experimental cut up that has no discernable
subject matter at all according to the transparencies of language?

Isn't that somehow conflating authorial position with subject matter?
And doesn't that very thinking always keep certain kinds of innovation
unseen ?  As well, doesn't it assume that "experimentation" remain in the
hands of the privileged? and for that matter, what work are we willing to
call "experimental" and for whom? Who defines that term and according to
what canon?

As I write this, having for many years helped with the programming of a
writing conference which concentrated on "experimental writing",  I am aware
that the homogeneity of the writers invited, the whiteness of the line up,
was often be 'excused' by some of the programmers because 'writers of color'
did not write according to that particular "experimental aesthetic"....


again I would wonder then, who defines the term "experimental" and what
value systems and social positions go behind those definitions?


Just musing on line here---

I’d be interested to hear any thoughts on these two
statements taken from a 1961 article associated with
the situationist international:

 “We, the creators of new values, are no longer
shouted down by the protectors of culture, but are
assigned designations in specialised fields, and our
demands are thus made to appear ridiculous."

          and


"Social snobbery would prescribe for the avant-garde a
particular place, which it can't leave without giving
up its respectability.”

From “The Avant-garde is Undesirable”

-- Helmut Sturm, Heimrad Prem, Lothar Fischer, Dieter
Kunzelmann, Hans-Peter Zimmer, Staffan Larsson, Asger
Jorn, Jørgen Nash, Katja Lindell & Maurice Wyckaert

January 1961

Translator unknown
http://situationist.cjb.net/

Does productively dangerous culture – detournement and
the like – have any effect anymore as a performative
critique at work in the present, or have
situationistesque tactics of cultural intervention
simply been almost seamlessly incorporated into the
society of spectacle (or post-society for any
Baudrillardians/Thatcherites lurking about, ha).


Steven Vincent states on this list:

In and of itself
innovation, poetic or otherwise, does not, so to
speak, reveal "the silver
bullet."  Whatever the syntactical intervention - and
how its operationally
viewed - the critical act of reading still has to
determine whether the work
"makes it" or not, as well what constitutes "making
it.".


Isn’t intention, insofar as it is **situated** in a
poetics or poetic community, whathaveyou, sort of the
bottom line (in terms of the construction of meaning,
modes of thinking, etc)? I'm guessing Clark Coolidge's
work doesn't do much 'cultural work' outside the
academy or progressive poetry circles, does it? What
does this mean viz. a viz. postmodernist claims for
collapsed binaries, categories, etc (replace Coolidge
w/ a better example at will, I'm not a scholar)?


Consequently, if it is still useful to talk of a
‘living’ avant-garde, what does this suggest about the
nexus – or interface - of a well-educated coterie of
artists/poets and something like ‘mass’ or ‘popular’
culture. If everyday life is the frontier between the
dominated and the undominated sectors of life, and
thus the terrain of chance and uncertainty, where or
how can an avant-garde find its toe-holds at the level
of the everyday?

What does it mean when 24 year-olds like myself (sorry
to disappoint those who had me pegged as 16) feel
melancholic about the “unfinished project of
modernism”? Irrespective of whether that makes me a
'properly pomo' kid; I've come to a provisional
agreement with myself that a disavowal of individual
agency usually if not always reeks of bad faith. Just
as Lyotard's 'incredulity with respect to
meta-narratives' (if taken prescriptively rather than
descriptively, to throw a nod to Timothy Yu) is so
dumb and self-referentially incoherent I suspect
history will consign it to the bin currently housing
logical positivism and flat earth theory.


Clearly, a commitment to affordable education and a
transformation of institutional pedagogy are one
aspect of these questions, but my experience as an
undergraduate ‘fly on the wall’ in a fairly
progressive English faculty, suggested that these
items are easily consumed and subsumed in the frenzied
desperation of placements and personal and
departmental Real Politicking.

Another question, if members of this listserv are in
broad agreement that polemics are seldom of much use,
then, aside from spending evenings eviscerating
well-intentioned jackasses (sorry, very bad taste I
know, couldn’t resist), how is it that you get your
sublimating kicks? Do you all sideline in noiserock
bands on the weekend? If only it were true.

Oh dear, that leads me to something else, does anyone
know if any interesting attention has been paid the
nexus of postrock noise bands like Lightning Bolt, the
boredoms, Chicago’s incomparable Shellac, etc, and the
aesthetics of sound poetry, concrete poetry, etc. I’m
familiar with the cultural studies preocc. w/
recuperating subculture into the academy, lamely
handled as a matter of fashion a la Dick Hebdige et
al., but what about the MATERIALITY of SOUND; modes of
production – small press, chapbooks/indie labels, 7
inch singles; readings/gigs. . . I guess this gets
more sociological – it’s the aesthetics of noise I’m
interested in (much changed since the hey day of Sonic
Youth, let alone Futurist stuff, I’d add). The
bravado, swagger, and spectacle of Sex Pistols era
punk has given way to some truly innovative work that
I would love to see incorporated into discussions of
contemporary poetics.


Thoughts? Comments?

Andrew,
for this I'd recommend Jacques Attali's book Noise: the Political Economy of
Music, written in the 70's (outdated in certain senses but still really
compelling). A couple more recent writers on sound are Brandon LaBelle and
Christof Migone. Also check out the work of Douglas Kahn -- he wrote an
incredible history of sound in modernist art called Noise Water Meat. I've
also seen some articles on japanese noise at the Ctheory site. There has
actually been quite a lot (not surprisingly) written on the materiality of
sound in the last 30 or so years.

About Millie's comment that "Some black poets seem to have works that are
'blacker' and other works that are more experimental,' I think I can find a
clarifying analogy among jazz musicians more readily than poets: Houston
Person playing tenor with an organ trio is probably going to sound "blacker"
than when he's playing duets with Ran Blake. But this might also indicate
that the term "experimental" carries its own Caucasian baggage. Anthony
Braxton, to cite another example, plays music that is consistently
"experimental," but jazz critics, to the best of my knowledge, rarely
discuss his work as being "more black" or "less black," although I think
they might have when he was younger and less established. By staying in one
"place," I think he minimized the complications that labeling can cause.

These are great questions. It makes me think of two
things:

Malevich fleeing the artistic constraints of Stalin's
"social realism" is rejected by Bauhaus artists as a
"romantic."

Leslie Scalapino sends chapters from "Front Matter,
Dead Souls" to editorial pages of local newspapers
during the Gulf War. Transgressive and maybe a little
"performative" in that the act asked your average
sunday morning paper readers to encounter and accept
"avant-garde" art not in context of "avant-garde" but
in context of acceptable mode of daily communication.
This is made much more interesting, I believe, by the
fact that the act was done in total earnest--i.e.
probably without either "transgressive" or
"performative" intent as I read it, but rather
Scalapino's sincere belief in conceptual equivalence
between a letter to the editor on the Gulf War and a
chapter from that book and their mutual ability to
communicate their content.

The same as Malevich I believe. Meaning (I am thinking
this through as I write it so it is a little jumbled)
"avant-garde" artists who have gone beyond the
consideration of "form" and back to the issue of
"content." Or is that a boring distinction to make
here?

Or is everyone like this? It walks the funny line
between Howe's reading through the Oxford dictionary
(read Rachel Tzvia Back's great book on S. Howe where
she describes this) to write about her father, and
Waldrop's accidentally writing about her mother even
through chance procedure. There's that space between
Pollack's brush and his canvas.

Hey I guess I didn't really answer the question.

Baghdad Burning

... I'll meet you 'round the bend my friend, where hearts can heal and soul=
s
can mend...

Sunday, April 11, 2004
=A0
One of Those Countries...
We've taken to sleeping in the living room again. We put up the heavy drape=
s
the day before yesterday and E. and I re-taped the windows looking out into
the garden. This time, I made them use the clear tape so that the view
wouldn't be marred with long, brown strips of tape. We sleep in the living
room because it is the safest room in the house and the only room that will
hold the whole family comfortably.
The preparations for sleep begin at around 10 p.m. on days when we have
electricity and somewhat earlier on dark nights. E. and I have to drag out
the mats, blankets and pillows and arrange them creatively on the floor so
that everyone is as far away from the windows as possible, without actually
being crowded.=20
Baghdad is calm and relatively quiet if you don't count the frequent
explosions. Actually, when we don't hear explosions, it gets a bit worrying=
.
I know that sounds strange but it's like this- you know how you see someone
holding a rifle or gun and aiming at something, ready to fire? You cringe
and tense up while waiting for the gunshot and keep thinking, "It's coming,
it's coming...". That's how it feels on a morning without explosions.
Somehow, you just *know* there are going to be explosions... it's only a
matter of time. Hearing them is a relief and you can loosen up after they
occur and hope that they'll be the last of the day.
The hostage situations are a mess. I watch television and it feels like I'm
watching another country. All I can think is, "We've become one of *those*
countries..." You know- the ones where hostages are taken on a daily basis
and governments warn their civilians of visiting or entering the country.
It's especially sad because even during those long years during the blockad=
e
and in between wars and bombings, there were never any attacks on
foreigners. Iraqis are hospitable, friendly people who always used to treat
foreigners with care... now, everyone is treated like a potential enemy.
The case of the Japanese hostages is especially sad- I'm so sorry for their
families and friends specifically, and the Japanese people in general. We
keep hearing conflicting reports about their situation. This morning I hear=
d
that the kidnappers agreed to free them but someone else told me that it wa=
s
just a rumor... it's so hard to tell. It's heart-breaking to see them on
television and I wish there was something that could be done. Will the
Japanese government pull out the troops? Not likely... three people won't
matter to them. I hope they come out of this alive and well and I hope they
don't hold a grudge against Iraqis. There's hostility towards Japan because
of the fact that they sent soldiers... Japan became one of 'them' when they
decided to send over troops and these are the consequences. I'm so sorry...
in spite of the fact that dozens of Iraqis are abducted and killed each day=
,
I'm really sorry.=20
They say around 600 Iraqis were killed in Falloojeh- 120 children and 200
women... it's an atrocity and horribly sad. They have let one or two convoy=
s
in and the rest were sent back. The refugees from the area are flowing into
Baghdad and it's horrible to see them. Women and children with tear-stained
faces, mostly in black, carrying bundles of clothes and bottles of water.
The mosques are gathering food and clothes for them... one of the storage
areas for the refugee stuff was hit by an American tank today in A'adhamiya
and the scene is chaotic... scattered food, medication, bandages, blankets,
etc.=20
The south is a bit calmer because of the 'Arba'een' of the Imam Hussein
which will last for a couple of days... no one knows what will happen after=
.=20

  It's hard for me not to feel the echoes and accuracy of of this one
as Iraq collapses under the weight of events that this country has
precipitated. Whatever one wants, it's hard to say "Happy Easter" without a
certain twist in the gut.


The Second Coming

    Turning and turning
    Within the widening gyre
    The falcon cannot hear the falconer
    Things fall apart
    The center cannot hold
    And a blood dimmed tide
    Is loosed upon the world

    Nothing is sacred
    The ceremony sinks
    Innocence is drowned
    In anarchy
    The best lack conviction
    Given some time to think
    And the worst are full of passion
    Without mercy

    Surely some revelation is at hand
    Surely it's the second coming
    And wrath has finally taken form
    For what is this rough beast
    Its hour come at last
    Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
    Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born

    Hoping and hoping
    As if by my weak faith
    The spirit of this world
    Would heal and rise
    Vast are the shadows
    That straddle and strafe
    And struggle in the darkness
    Troubling my eyes

    Shaped like a lion
    It has the head of a man
    With a gaze as blank
    And pitiless as the sun
    And it's moving its slow thighs
    Across the desert sands
    Through dark indignant
    Reeling falcons

    Surely some revelation is at hand
    Surely it's the second coming
    And the wrath has finally taken form
    For what is this rough beast
    Its hour come at last
    Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
    Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born

    Raging and raging
    It rises from the deep
    Opening its eyes
    After twenty centuries
    Vexed to a nightmare
    Out of a stormy sleep
    By a rocking cradle
    By the Sea of Galilee

    Surely some revelation is at hand
    Surely it's the second coming
    And the wrath has finally taken form
    For what is this rough beast
    Its hour come at last
    Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
    Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born

Steven,
Beautifully written!=20

Though, I for one am convinced our current president is a right-wing =
Christian zealot determined to make the world safe for his kind.  And =
that, to me is the problem with all zealots...they're militaristic in =
their passions for the views they hold. =20

We need no second coming of Jesus or of any one else to fix this mess.  =
Instead, we need a non-invasive technique for performing frontal lobe =
lobotomy on all zealots of any kind, from Bahai to Voodoo, they all do =
major harm to the rest of humankind. =20

But I soap-box and unintentionally distract from your far more =
brilliantly scribed piece. =20
Thanks again for sharing it.
Alex =20

It sure as hell isn't Yeats.  More "Yeast" than Yeats, to use Joyce's name for
WBY in _Finnegans Wake_.

For the record, _this_ is Yeats:

The Second Coming

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of _Spiritus Mundi_
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

I wrote this a while ago, thought it might amuse....

The Iraqiad: Book One

Sing, O Goddess of the wrath of W, son of George HW, that brought upon the
Iraqis
Countless ills, thrusting many a brave soul down to Hades, and fed the
vultures
From the bodies of many heroes, and the dogs as well, for so were the
counsels
Of Jove, fulfilled onward from that accursed day when W and the great UN
began to quarrel bitterly.  And which of the Gods set them on to quarrel? It
was
the son of Jove and Leto, for he was angry with W, and sent airplanes full
of death
To attack W's fort and the two towers belonging to his allies, and great was
W's wrath,
For he thought he was inviolable. Yet greater still was his greed, and so
the weasely W
Sacrificed many randy goats, and even more stubborn oxen, to assuage the
Gods
Who sent him this curse.  But secretly, keeping his own counsel, W of the
empty head
Gave praise to all the Gods who dwell in Olympus for the wondrous
opportunity
Which this disaster sent to him, and empty-headed W jumped for joy in the
manner
Of a wild deer who, starved of grass by the endless snows of winter, jumps
towards
A branch of pine to garner its prickly nutrients: thus did W jump alone in
his oval tent,
When all his warriors and all his counselors were busy obeying the orders
that he sent.
And a great cloud of Downsizing and Hunger was let forth upon the people of
America,
for so is the hard custom of the Gods, who, in their infinite and
unassailable wisdom,
punish the many and innocent citizens of a Land whose king has offended
virtue,
So that, like a wave upon the boiling sea that topples beach houses and
dikes as it strikes
The craggy land, they rise up and with one voice, topple the traitor King.
Such is the will of the Gods.

Baghdad Burning

... I'll meet you 'round the bend my friend, where hearts can heal and =
souls
can mend...

Sunday, April 11, 2004
=A0
One of Those Countries...
We've taken to sleeping in the living room again. We put up the heavy =
drapes
the day before yesterday and E. and I re-taped the windows looking out =
into
the garden. This time, I made them use the clear tape so that the view
wouldn't be marred with long, brown strips of tape. We sleep in the =
living
room because it is the safest room in the house and the only room that =
will
hold the whole family comfortably.
The preparations for sleep begin at around 10 p.m. on days when we have
electricity and somewhat earlier on dark nights. E. and I have to drag =
out
the mats, blankets and pillows and arrange them creatively on the floor =
so
that everyone is as far away from the windows as possible, without =
actually
being crowded.=20
Baghdad is calm and relatively quiet if you don't count the frequent
explosions. Actually, when we don't hear explosions, it gets a bit =
worrying.
I know that sounds strange but it's like this- you know how you see =
someone
holding a rifle or gun and aiming at something, ready to fire? You =
cringe
and tense up while waiting for the gunshot and keep thinking, "It's =
coming,
it's coming...". That's how it feels on a morning without explosions.
Somehow, you just *know* there are going to be explosions... it's only a
matter of time. Hearing them is a relief and you can loosen up after =
they
occur and hope that they'll be the last of the day.
The hostage situations are a mess. I watch television and it feels like =
I'm
watching another country. All I can think is, "We've become one of =
*those*
countries..." You know- the ones where hostages are taken on a daily =
basis
and governments warn their civilians of visiting or entering the =
country.
It's especially sad because even during those long years during the =
blockade
and in between wars and bombings, there were never any attacks on
foreigners. Iraqis are hospitable, friendly people who always used to =
treat
foreigners with care... now, everyone is treated like a potential enemy.
The case of the Japanese hostages is especially sad- I'm so sorry for =
their
families and friends specifically, and the Japanese people in general. =
We
keep hearing conflicting reports about their situation. This morning I =
heard
that the kidnappers agreed to free them but someone else told me that it =
was
just a rumor... it's so hard to tell. It's heart-breaking to see them on
television and I wish there was something that could be done. Will the
Japanese government pull out the troops? Not likely... three people =
won't
matter to them. I hope they come out of this alive and well and I hope =
they
don't hold a grudge against Iraqis. There's hostility towards Japan =
because
of the fact that they sent soldiers... Japan became one of 'them' when =
they
decided to send over troops and these are the consequences. I'm so =
sorry...
in spite of the fact that dozens of Iraqis are abducted and killed each =
day,
I'm really sorry.=20
They say around 600 Iraqis were killed in Falloojeh- 120 children and =
200
women... it's an atrocity and horribly sad. They have let one or two =
convoys
in and the rest were sent back. The refugees from the area are flowing =
into
Baghdad and it's horrible to see them. Women and children with =
tear-stained
faces, mostly in black, carrying bundles of clothes and bottles of =
water.
The mosques are gathering food and clothes for them... one of the =
storage
areas for the refugee stuff was hit by an American tank today in =
A'adhamiya
and the scene is chaotic... scattered food, medication, bandages, =
blankets,
etc.=20
The south is a bit calmer because of the 'Arba'een' of the Imam Hussein
which will last for a couple of days... no one knows what will happen =
after.

I love the notion of Yeats as a moral spirit declaiming upon the evils of
war. This is the same Yeats who quoted 'Send war in our time, Oh Lord', who
despised the sufferings of the soldiers in the WW1 trenches, who carefully
footnoted The Second Coming so that conservative readers would not be
perturbed, whose first biographer, Joseph Hone, was a crypto-fascist in
sympathy with Hitler, who waxed lyrical about the eternities of race on the
eve of WW2, who .... aw, no more, I don't want to think about it anymore. A
great musicality, for sure, but what he says .....

Murat, these are interesting questions.  I think you're right that
the case of Villa shows how characterizing a poet in terms of certain
formal qualities (experiment, avant-gardism, etc.) can be
simultaneously a way of comprehending and controlling that poet's
social identity.

I'm not sure it would be quite right to say that Villa was considered
avant-garde, but rather that he was read as a modernist.  Of course,
the relation between these two terms is totally fraught, but at least
for some critics "modernism" signifies the work of individual writers
(Eliot, Joyce, Woolf, for example) who have been inserted into a
canonical narrative about the Anglo-American literary tradition,
while "avant-garde" suggests a practice that positions itself outside
and questions that tradition.  For example, it's been important for
some critics to claim Gertrude Stein's work as modernist--capable of
standing beside that of Joyce or Woolf in the canon--while others
(I'm thinking of Marianne DeKoven, for example) insist on claiming
Stein as an avant-gardist who stands outside and critiques the
institutions of modernism.

It's important to remember that the U.S. "establishment" that Villa
confronted during his brief rise to prominence in the 1950s was one
dominated by the ideology of modernism (or, at least, a New Critical
redaction of modernism).  I would argue (although others might
disagree) that Villa's poetry reflects a quite conscious effort to
gain access to this establishment, as reflected in his flamboyant
allusions to Hopkins, Dickinson, the metaphysicals, etc.--allusions
that his readers very much picked up on.  So I don't think that to
regard Villa as an "outsider" in this respect--i.e. one who does not
care at all how readers receive him--is quite accurate, although his
rapid fall from favor shows that his position as "insider" was
unstable, inflected not just by style but by race, nationality, and
colonialism.

More generally: is the idea of the "outsider" writer really a useful
one?  Every writer has some idea of an audience (even an imagined
one), and ostensible indifference to the response of the
"establishment" is a fairly widespread authorial fiction.  A
Hollywood director who professes indifference to critics' responses
doesn't cease to be Hollywood, nor does the writer who claims to
write only for herself or himself (a very common claim) become thus
disqualified for a Pulitzer prize or canonization.  In fact, I wonder
if the fiction of not caring what anyone calls one's writing can
blind one to the way literary politics, power, and economics really
work.

Your remarks remind me of Howard Becker's book _Art Worlds_, which
argues that the only way art institutions and conventions change is
through the appearance of individual "mavericks" who couldn't care
less about convention, but whose work then ends up rewriting the
rules.  This is romantically appealing, but I think it's much more
the case that multiple "art worlds" coexist at any one time, each
with its own structure, with relations of power between them.  That's
one lesson of the idea of the avant-garde, which is aware of itself
as a group with institutions outside that of the dominant art world,
but whose major goal may not be acceptance by those dominant
institutions.

As to "establishment" vs. "mainstream": what they have in common is
that they're basically negative terms, employed by those who see
themselves as dissident, rebellious, excluded or merely
distinctive--so they really have no stable content, since they're
used by different people for different reasons at different times.
(You don't hear too many poets proudly proclaiming how "mainstream"
or "establishment" their work is.)  They do have different period
rings to my ear, though.  "Establishment" sounds very 1950s or
'60s--some idea of a monolithic and elitist culture or academy that
needs to be overthrown from below.  "Mainstream" sounds more
contemporary, both more aware of the diffuseness of poetic practice
and perhaps less explicit about attaching those practices to
particular institutions of power--maybe more appropriate for a
culture in which "alternative" is a section in the record store.

Mr. Ray Bianchi very kindly mentioned me in his email about Chicago poets and
poetry; however, my name was misspelled.  It should read Eric Elshtain.

I also wanted to mention that Beard of Bees Press, a web-based free press out of
Chicago, is accepting submissions for poetry chapbooks.  Known mostly for being
the home of gnoetry, a computer-generated poetry program, we also have published
chapbooks by Catherine Daly, Amy England, Antonio Facchino and Jacques Roubaud
(translated by Eleni Sikelianos).

We are interested in procedural, constraint-driven poetries (be the constraints
metrical, algorithmic, ideational or etc.)

*26 Magazine*
7-9 PM
at 21 Grand
449 B 23rd St. Oakland
$4 cover for your thirsty maws


Release Party for Magazine 26!

Thursday, April 29th we will be celebrating the much
anticipated release of 26 Magazine, Issue C: a journal
of poetry and poetics with readers Linda Norton, Brian
Teare kari edwards and James Meetze.

26 is a Bay Area based magazine edited by Avery E.D.
Burns, Rusty Morrison, Joseph Noble, Elizabeth
Robinson and Brian Strang.  There will be wine,
friends and good company, plus, copies of 26 will be
available for purchase at the event.

About the readers:

Linda Norton is a senior editor of the Regional Oral
History Office in the Bancroft Library at the
University of California.  She has published her
poems, stories, essays, stories, and collages in a
number of little magazines, and has written lyrics for
music by composer Eve Beglarian.  That piece,
"Landscaping for Privacy," has been performed,
translated, recorded on an Emergency Music CD on CRI.


Brian Teare has been recipient of Stegner, National
Endowment for the Arts, and MacDowell Colony
fellowships and has published poems in Volt, Boston
Review, Ploughshares, and the Colorado Review.  His
first book, The Room Where I was Born, won the 2003
Brittingham Prize and was published by the University
of Wisconsin Press.

James Meetze is the author of *Serenades,* just
published by Cy Press, and the publisher of Tougher
Disguises Press. Of his work, John Donne says, "Thou
shalt not love by ways so dangerous" and Emily
Dickinson, "The man who would possess must first
present certificate of...his absent character."  He
now calls San Francisco home, where he lives with his
beautiful novelist and radio and palace. His book
Instrument & Amplifier is hopefully forthcoming from
somewhere...Or you could just use the one in 26.

That's the point I am trying to make. The avant garde isolates certains forms
-in the last decade or so, specifically, the narrative- from "legimitate"
poetic activity from its point of view. This anti-narrative bias has specific
consequences how a poem is viewed. Does that make the narrative -or any poetic
activity implicitly based on its significance- illegitimate, backward or
unadventurous? For writers whose sensibilities are not exclusively Western European,
that's an infuriating assumption. That's partly the focus behind my question,
"Why should an outsider writer care what or how the establishment calls
his/her work?"

Ok, Timothy Yu has noted that a qualified apology is
really no apology at all. Fair enough:

I apologise for making remarks which were hurtful. I
am sorry.

As for Leny Strobel's question of whether 'a
non-racist' can say racist things, I presume this is
in gest(?)

Can a feminist inadertantly say misogynist things? Can
a kind person say mean things? Can an intelligent
person say stupid things? Can someone trying to argue
a point reinforce its opposite? Can an adult say
childish things? Surely the answer to
these questions is yes.

As to the degree of respect or compassion with which
one responds to such remarks, I would suggest this too
bears on the debate.

sincerely,

Andrew.

Thanks, David, for cleaning up the record here. What a "Googling"
embarrassment on my part! On top of which it's a Julie Mitchell "improv"
version! I imagine slipshod Google cut & paste 'research' is one of the
banes of contemporary education.

Also curious to see the upheaval at Yeats by some - just looking at the
poem's text (and not blending in the disturbing aspects of the poet's
biography) I do find parts of the poem's sense of disintegration and
helplessness to be appropriate in context of what's happening in Iraq and
"our" involvement there. But if that angst seems textualized as too retro
Christian & mytho what else,  I guess one can imagine, if an ironic reading
is required, a scene in which S Hussein is reading the first stanza("things
fall apart" etc.) aloud from within his cave. Audiences at the 9/11
Commission Hearings could call out and demand, "Surely some revelation is at
hand." And poor George B himself, down in Crawford, "vexed" and "slouching"
in and and out of his pickup truck while getting the un-spun news direct
from Iraq on the panel intercom is getting  pissed and petulantly shouting
out, "Surely the Second Coming is at hand."

Oh well, still embarrassed,

OK, so Yeats had contemptible views.  So did Eliot, Pound, etc. (though not, I
hasten to add, Joyce -- at least here).  "The Second Coming" retains its appeal
partly because it can't hide the undercurrent of awe in the sublime horror of
the rough beast.  The sense that one doesn't know what to expect.

I imagine Rummy, Bremer, Cheney, Wolfowitz etc. are much like the hapless
falconer.  (Bush 43, meanwhile, is like the falconer's stupid dog chasing a
butterfly into the bushes.)

ATTENTION SMALL PUBLISHERS & SMALL MAGAZINES:

On May 1 and 2, Gallery 108 in Somerville, MA will be sponsoring the 1st Annual Yart Sale at the Gallery.  Lots of local artists will be selling affordable pieces and I will be manning a table of local (an not neccesarily so local) small press books and magazines.

If you have any interest in having your journal for sale at the Yart Sale, please contact me at mark_lamoureux@yahoo.com.  The sale will run from morning until evening both days on the 1st and 2nd.  Essentially, I'll be selling stuff on a consignment basis.  You give me your wares and I will sell them and put aside any money that you make and return the money and unsold stock to you.  There are no fees involved, as this event is largely just to stir up interest in the Gallery, and by way of local presses, etc. interest in upcoming literary events at the Gallery.

The deadline for submissions for the sale will be Wednesday, April 28th.  This is a good opportunity to try and get your books/magazine to an audience outside of the exclusively literary scene.

Take care,
Mark Lamoureux

Hi Miekal



Does this mean that experimental poetry has become an online genre because
of the current state of the book business, which doesn't support it, or does
it mean that experimental poetry, in becoming the majority, has become the
new mainstream?

I think it means that "mainstream" poetry is a word used by
experimental poets to refer to work contrary to their own.

Dissociated Writer’s Project (DWP) Reading and Music

Readings by:

Brad Senning

Purported founder of “reality fiction,” called
such by critics not because something real happens
in his fiction, but because, like Pinocchio, it
wants to be real. As he puts it, “A lot of what I
mean to do with fiction is more performance than
anything else. But part of me does wish that
fiction could influence congress and create a
recipe for the next great snack food.” His books
include “The Most Retarded-Looking Kid in Class
and Other Autobiographical Children’s Stories” and
“The Snow Inside My Mind.” He is featured in the
forthcoming Blue Collar Books Anthology.

Paul Sidewinder

Featured author at the Dissociated Writer’s
Project 2003 Baltimore Conference. His poetry
counts. It is full of words, and kind. Suddenly,
it appears. Often lazy, written with one hand, it
is a poetry of ideas, like the Strangler of
Blackmoor Castle. It’s deep like the crossword,
but less wordy. The best parts are dogs, puns, and
brevity. Even the rhyming is crappy. These poems
are affordable versions of exotic, more delicate
achievements. For truly poor people. His books
include, “I, Hippopotamus” and “Pearl Necklaces
and Other Things My Grandma Gave Me.”

Sean Enright

Sean Enright is a poet and fiction writer from
Maryland.  His novel, “Goof and Other Stories,”
was published in 2001. His poems have appeared in
many magazines.


Music by:

White Flight
Featuring ex-Black Eyes. White Flight is a free
improvisation group with saxophone, trumpet and
drums.

The evening to be hosted by local personality
Robert Brumfield whose name, in 1981, became
forever synonymous with top-quality aluminum siding.


About the Dissociated Writer’s Project:

The DWP is a cooperative of artists, writers,
performance artists, punk rockers, actors and
others. We host an annual festival of the arts,
publish a journal and books, hold rock concerts and
promote reading series.

As the Dissociated Writer’s Project, we do
everything we can to destabilize notions the public
might have about the role of arts in society. We
like to say that the DWP started when a marble
rolled off a shelf. That's an appropriate analogy
considering our simple, absurdist motives. Not
that we've ever had a message behind the madness,
but not having a message can be a message in
itself. And how else do we explain the fact that
at our first conference in Baltimore in 2003, there
was a woman in an ape suit who sat in on readings
eating a yellow pencil. There was also a man
dressed up as a news reporter standing outside the
conference broadcasting a report with a
microphone but no camera. He was a DWP favorite
because we all feel like that: we have a lot to
say and desperately want to say it even if nobody
is there at our most dramatic moments long enough to
notice.

In some ways the Dissociated Writers Project is
just a bunch of guys reading and performing to
the public, as they work their way toward some
distant, evanescent, ideal art form. A Philadelphia
paper recently said that we were confused. No
doubt! When you’re trying to sprint down the
crushed brick track you have the benefit of a
finish-line ahead of you. We’re lucky if we’ve got
a flashlight on a dark, moonless night with nothing
but alligators for footing. We don’t know where
we’re going, but if we can make it through the
dishes piled up in the sink, we’re hopeful about
our next meal.

Bill, depending on any one person's or project's approach to 'experimental' I'm not sure if it is valid to say "how experimental is anything anymore?" Experimental in the holistic sense, in the Cagean sense, in the subversive sense? Experimentation implies unknowns, implies what may yield for a particual experiment. If it has goals i.e. if it is political in nature, cultural (whatever that means), are you saying that the modes of experimentation are outdated? Out of context? There's also the possibility of the religious experiment, and this is a new idea for me, that in experimenting, not with religion, but 'through' it, by participating, we can never 'physically' know the end result, mentally possibly because we 'know' of a greater being or afterlife in an afterrealm. Experimentation precludes a body of work, its goals may possibly be set through the results of the experiment; I wouldn't call a work 'experimental', absolutely, John Cage threw away numerous 'chances.' But my
 impression, and my belief, is that if a body of work is to 'work', then it must show signs, or, rather, to use a better term, it must show evidence of this experimentation within the body of work, the writer's (musician's, painter's sculptor's, &c.) struggle with these results, and the evolution of the work as guided by these struggles. This is my project: evolution of work against the evidence it may or may not be in contention with.

So, "how experimental is anything anymore?"

 ---

 CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS: We seek submissions for an anthology of younger
 Canadian poets. If you consider what you write to be poetry, we would love
 to see your work.

 We wish to include writers whose writing invites a reader's intention.

 ELIGIBILITY: The anthology will focus on new, younger Canadian poets. These
 poets may have an interest in expanding their definition of poetry through
 exploratory writing in traditional, visual, found, constraint-based, sound,
 mathematic, surreal, and prose forms. Authors may also take interest in
 developing a personal poetics that is reflected in their writing. The
 anthology will work to represent both the explorative and community-based
 practices with which up-and-coming authors engage.

 SUBMIT: Please send 15-20 pages of unpublished or published poetry (please
 indicate if published). Poetic statements or other supplementary materials
 are welcome, but not required. Please include a self-addressed stamped
 envelope (SASE) if you are sending via snail mail and would like a

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am coming late to this whole discussion of confessionalism and the avant
garde and the politics of literary criticism/production, but I would like to
add something to it from the work I'm doing on the 13th century Persian
writer Saadi. I am translating his book, the Gulistan, which is a piece of
wisdom literature that he wrote in the 1200s, and one of the interesting
things that has emerged in all the reading I have done is the evolution of
how critics have seen his use of the first person-and these are mostly
western critics or western critics' reportage of what Persian critics have
had to say. From at least the mid-1800s, and probably before, until around
the middle of the 20th century, critics have taken at face value the
autobiographical accuracy and intent of Saadi's use of the first person,
this despite the fact that there are obvious contradictions within the text.
In one part, for example, Saadi characterizes himself as being 50 years old;
in another part, it's clear that he would have to have been at least 70 for
the text to be factually accurate. There are other examples as well which
point to the likelihood that the "I" Saadi employs is a fictional one,
despite the fact that the Gulistan is not, properly speaking, a work of
fiction. In other words, earlier critics had to have engaged on some level
in a willful misreading of the text, and it is worth asking what purpose
that misreading served for them, how it was connected to their understanding
of Persian-as-other, especially since Saadi's work, particularly in the
18th-19th centuries was so thoroughly celebrated in England and the US. My
own sense is that it probably had something to do with the desire to see
what I will inadequately call here "the simple yet profound wisdom of the
east" in Saadi-a vision that is fraught with racist, imperialist and other
"ist" implications-and to acknowledge any "dishonesty" in the text-i.e., a
fictionalized "I"-would have undermined that agenda. Another way of saying
this, perhaps, is that while critics were willing to acknowledge the formal
innovations in Saadi-and I will include in my notion of form here the fact
that Saadi wrote all of the verses in the Gulistan himself, which was an
innovation that he himself notes in the book-they were not so interested in
the way the self that inhabits/that is created in and through the text might
also have been a product of intentional writerly artifice.

By way of illustration, the text opens with a religious invocation, part of
which reads as follows (the translation is mine, and it is still a draft):

A man of God immersed himself in meditation. When he emerged from the vision
that was granted him, a smiling companion welcomed him back, "What beautiful
gift have you brought us from the garden in which you were walking?" The
holy man replied, "I walked until I reached the rosebush, where I gathered
up the skirts of my robe to hold the roses I wanted to present to my
friends, but the scent of the petals so intoxicated me that I let everything
fall from my hands."
Later on, in the section where he talks about how he came to write the
Gulistan-the word means, literally, rose garden-he presents himself as a man
who goes to the rose garden, a literal one in which he spends the night with
his friend, and is able to bring the roses (meaning the pages of the book)
back to share with others. I don't think this is an accident. Similarly, my
guess is that there is a pattern within the anecdotes-the book, except for
the last chapter, is a series of anecdotes-of those in which Saadi presents
himself as an observer/reporter and those in which he actually takes part in
the action of the narrative. (This last is a theory I have not had a chance
to investigate.) My point is that Saadi, it seems to me, is very consciously
constructing a textual self that is distinct from his autobiographical self
and is therefore not merely an artifact of the text itself.

I guess that's it. I don't know if it adds anything new to the conversation,
but it struck me that the discussion had a much broader relevance than the
20th and 21st century focus that was being developed and I wanted, however
clumsily, to point that out.

Cheers!

Richard

If "experimental" is the new mainstream, I guess somebody forgot to
tell Dana Gioia, the poet who now heads the National Endowment for
the Arts.  There's something in the latest Reader's Digest (that most
mainstream of publications) lauding Gioia's stewardship of the NEA
away from the controversies of the 1980s (Mapplethorpe, Serrano, et
al.) toward a new sense of artistic "merit" or "the best."  Here's
what that means for Gioia:

"Gioia believes that the NEA did veer off track, and he thinks he
knows why.  'Some works of art are better than others,' the
53-year-old chairman says, 'but the bizarre thing is that not all
intellectuals believe that.'  He also thinks that the NEA became
'obsessed with imagining that its purpose was to foster experimental
art'...Gioia said that the NEA needs 'programs of indisputable
merit'...To Gioia, it's about serving the public, not the insular
arts community."

So the "experimental" here is precisely that which does not have
merit, does not have any standards of judgment, and serves the few
rather than the many.  As far as I can tell from the article (not
very informative, of course), what's mainstream is Shakespeare, and
lots of it.

Tim, my first question is in relation to the distinction you make between=20
"modernism" and "the avant-garde." Particularly within a wider European=20
framework, how real is it? Stein was a great friend and champion of Picasso.=
 Both in=20
ethos and style, it seems to me, Picasso is the quintessential modernist.
True that Stein's writing is more appealing today (at least to a few of us)=20
than Joyce's, but this does not suggest an anti-establishment bent on her pa=
rt.=20
She did want to get published, but couldn't. Ulla Dydo suggests that the=20
Toklas book was an attempt by Stein's part to build a bridge with the public=
.

My comments were not concerned with a writer's wishes, but "subjectivity" of=

the public's response, which distorts the text for its own needs. That's how=

it is. Wyhat I said was that the writer should or needs to be aware of this=20

Murat, you're entirely right that the difference between "modernist"
and "avant-garde" is a very problematic one, and that the label has a
lot more to do with where critics now want to position an author than
any kind of historical reality.  Those who oppose the two terms tend,
I think, to be valorizing the latter.  It's true that Stein (like
Picasso) had a lot of qualities such critics might associate with
modernism--a belief in the great individual genius, a disdain for
movements and followers--but it's also true that her role as a
creator of networks among artists places her closer to the social
practices of the avant-garde, and that it has taken decades (in
comparison to Eliot, Joyce, or Woolf) for her work to be even seen as
comprehensible.

In any case, being or not being "anti-establishment" is not really
the point; Italian and Russian futurism--indisputably avant-gardes, I
would think--at various times formed alliances with powerful
political factions or regimes and were patronized by such regimes.

My question is about how broadly we define the "establishment" and
the "public," especially when we try to place the writer outside (and
opposed to) these categories.  My sense is that you want to privilege
the position of the writer who rejects the desires of "the public"
and "follows [her or his] own way."  Fair enough--I think this idea
may be a necessary fiction for any writer.  But really there are many
publics, and a writer may seek or resist acceptance by different
publics at different times, and imagining "the public" as a monolith
to be resisted can mislead both writers and those who seek to
understand their work.  To resist one kind of public might be to
appeal to another, for better or worse.

maybe it's because i've been called experimental for years, and don't
fipnd a 'place' here, whatever, but there's something to be said for
producing/production and not worrying about the categories. i try to
extend language sound video whatever to any nearby category and look for
the breaking-point. meanwhile discussions go on here, but i see very
little evidence of experimental or avant work at all - maybe it's dead,

In COMPLETE contrast to the emotional distance of my
previous appearances on this list, I have a very
serious question or two to ask of anyone - though
specifically and maybe only any woman - on this list
who has the time or inclination to respond.

I have excerpted something I’ve been working on and
I’m wondering if the fact that I am a man means I
should not be doing what I’ve done and am doing **and
furthermore, what access does loving someone grant in
regard to another's trauma insofar as the trauma is no
longer ONLY theirs (meaning both that something is
constructed in the text which is distinct from a lived
reality but also that the text in some way takes off
from that trauma, perhaps carrying some of it to
unkown places)?**

Further, does a man,  have the right to respectfully
use, a=b=u=s=e, appropriate, and interpolate the work
of a woman in ANY circumstances??

I have agonized over these issues privately for long
enough.

I am very serious about these questions, and I’d
appreciate responses in kind. Any responses will
determine whether or not I pursue this work in some
form or delete it from existence.

**note** the subject matter, if not language, is
disturbing. Also: It's not poetry.


Title of section:


THE DOING ITSELF IS EVERYTHING.(I AM OBSESSED WITH
GERTRUDE STEIN WHO TOOK MY HORROR AS POLISHED STONES.)


There’s no future in my father’s dreaming my father’s
meing, my father’s deepening. I am watching Miami Vice
on the FAMILY FARM. If I get on my hands and knees my
hands and knees become false to me.  Blind fear, a
kind in glass and a cousin, that seeing reason leads,
finds a safeness in a spectacle and nothing strange in
a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system of
tripping up my footing. All this and not more ordinary
than blind reason stumbling without fear not unordered
in not resembling: to fear the worst oft means there
is still worse. The difference is spreading out of
genetics and redness and out of rudeness comes a way
of being kept, in touch. **Even if you don’t say it,
people can just tell. They do tell. They tell. Do you
know? **The resemblance is to yellow is dirtier and
distincter, never more, the same sounder, the
furniture, the amusing side is that the sooner there
are no fewer the more certain is the necessity
dwindled, is necessity to mingle in bone holes the way
I am customized. Dirt and not copper makes the
afternoon darker. A great loss, if inside is let in
there are more spaces not empty. **My hands are an old
Chinese man’s, my father’s fist busts Tom’s cheek
open, squash, we are loved.**


xii. But no such substratum exists; there is no
‘being’ behind, acting, becoming, writing; ‘the
author’ is merely a fiction imposed on the doing—the
doing itself is everything.



My physical disproportions were like bruises that
wouldn’t heal.  When you are despised on your own
FAMILY FARM you learn to expend your fragility in
total isolation before the space that is and is not
you is penetrated red open. The way horror and dreams
are true.


So much depends on a bedroom door.


Here is another sketch of life on the FAMILY FARM from
what can be remembered without living it exactly: I
wanted a bicycle to get away from here, so Tom said we
could sell my kittens but nobody outside the city will
pay for an animal that doesn’t produce meat and this
was my punishment for what I couldn’t understand.  My
punishment for what I couldn’t understand was a
collapse and a sold hole, a little less hot.



Anything that appears as it does will appear nonsense
and thus never appear with any weight or affect.
Because I am at least brainy enough to realize this I
am throwing all my chips in with intelligibility which
is the denial of pain. A shallow hole means does it
not a damper a stream of pounding my dear it means
nearly enough choice makes a steady midnight, bolts
and reckless reckless rats elude a mother’s ears, a
mother’s sneer. Mince meat.



Any system is aimed at kindness is a nice thing to
say, please could, please could, jam it not plus more
sit in when.


Left open, to be left pounded, to be left closed, to
be circulating in summer and winter, and spilt color
that is shame and empty to be sure days are cigarettes
by length and by doubling. Nothing elegant.



One thing that being on the FAMILY FARM is teaching me
is that there is no such thing as right or wrong,
excepting that I am an abomination.


I can turn my body over in my mind, a shape to be
moved in space, a physical relation folded, punched
with predetermined holes and unfolding, a girl happens
to repeat herself to be pleasant in music, a signature
ensures crimes of imagined cousins penetrating,
bruising, space.


xiii. I can take modernism as the unthinking of
previous thought by a scattered group of bourgeois
nerds. I cannot take any writing that does not speak
to a person in pain seriously anymore, kitsch is only
meaningful in stark contrast.



I’ve closed in around something. Now that I’m moving
through pain, my pain is a cloud of butterflies, soft
as dust, settling into every micro-possibility and
transmitting signals tuned to my gaping wounds. Now I
am fuckable and getting the hell out of here. So long
Liar’s Minor. I would suck Francis of Assisi’s
chancered cock to feed the innocents I’ll never get
close enough not to love.  Hello. . .  Edmonton.



Dear Jesus Christ,

Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It
is good for a man not to touch a woman.


Dear Francine C:

But if he cannot contain, let him marry: for it is
better to marry than to burn.

Dear Jesus Christ,

You and I are through.

I think that whether what you are doing is ok depends on how the woman in
question views your work.  I think it is nasty to wrote about someone
without telling them, or if they don't want you to, but it can be ok if they
gove you permission. There is no reason why a man cannot write a piece from
the point of view of a woman -- there are no limits to fiction.  But when
you take the life of a REAL person, man or woman, then what you write can
hurt them if they don't want their life revealed.

As for the work itself, I think it is well-done and would defnitely be a
worthy project if it were fiction.  If you have fictionalized it
extensively, you may be in an ok position, if people who know your subject
could not identifity her.  Your excerpt has a string personal style and is
clearly literary, not a "kiss and tell" piece, so I think you are not merely
exploiting the woman in question, you are transforming something you have
heard into your own literary work.  Surely as an artist you have a right to
transmute what you see and hear into works of art.  That is the basic role
of the artist.  But you are better off combining several people's experience
into one character, or using only a small part of someone's story, rather
than taking their entire life and appropriating it.

Of course if you don't publish what you write you can write anything you
want.  I think the offense to the person who life you use is PUBLISHING
their intimate details, not merely typing them into your own computer.  It
is a gray area whether you can distribute such a work to lists like this if
the person doesn't know.  I'd guess it is not a great idea, but it isn't as
bad as if it appeared in a journal or newspaper.

I have been in the position of someone who was written about (and it annoyed
me).  I have also haad the opportunity to write about others.  For example,
I wrote (but have not yet gotten published) a whole series of
autobiographical things about life with me (now ex) boyfriend who has
schizophrenia.  He gave me permission. But now he is my ex, and might no
longer want me to write about him.  I have mixed feelings about the whole
thing.  I think it is interesting "material" but it IS his personal tragedy,
not mine.

I broke my own rule once by getting an article  (
http://www.newyorkcityvoices.org/2002septoct/20021003.html ) published about
someone I knew which the person (presumably) would never find out about.  I
had very mixed feelings about this, and may have done the wrong thing.  But
I didn't identify the person specifically in my article, and tried to leave
out details that would allow others to identify him.   The guy who was the
subject was a street person (now housed, thankfully!) who is mentally ill,
and it was basically a very positive portrait (I respected this person a
lot -- he is quite bright and might have had a different kind of life if he
had been born rich or hadn't gotten sick.)  Still, people in my immediate
neighbirhood or those in his treatment program could have figured out who
the story was about.  I don't know if I exploited this guy or not,.  I know
the honest thing would have been to ask him if I could write about him, and
the fact that I was afraid he'd say "no" meant that maybe I shouldn't have
done it.

I also once wrote and got published a poem which quoted a shrink I was
seeing.  I think I was within my rights because I quoted what he said to me
in the context of my therapy, not personal details of his life (which I knew
nothing about).  I made the mistake of showing him the poem (because the
asshole had made the horrible prediction tat I would never do anything
creative ever in my life, so I wanted to show him that I could get creative
work published), and he was not amused.  He really messed me over, and part
of his nastiness towards me was because he didn't like the poem.  In this
case, I think I was well within my rights to write the thing, but it was
stupid to show it to the shrink,  By the way, here is the poem:

DR. BURNOUT

is not in he's taking the afternoon off
to vacuum his office barcalounger
and test the springiness of the upholstery
with the new Jamaican receptionist
he's been eyeing for the last two weeks
dr. doesn't want to hear about your feelings
after all, they're immaterial the fall
of psychodynamic psychiatry is well-past
so please stick to symptoms, side-effects and such
and leave the feelings for your twelve-step group
on overcoming therapy addiction. diagnosis
is a mere formality useful for insurance purposes
we wouldn't want you to read in any more
meaning than can be coded in ICD-9 instead
we'd rather characterize your condition
by the characteristic response you have to
certain pharmacologic agents so rather than to say
that you're depressed which has so many extra-clinical
connotations better to say you have
Prozac-responsive syndrome.  don't bother to detail
the depths of your despair how you want to throw yourself
in front of the number 104 bus and end it all, enough
to say you have suicidal ideation and not waste
the doctor's time he is busy preparing his suntan
for the Psychiatric Association conference in Acapulco
where it wouldn't do to have pasty skin so please be brief
and to the point and pay your bill promptly the dr.
is running a business not a charity so have your
visa or mastercard ready (sorry no american express) as
you leave and please do not forget your next appointment
careful follow-up is essential to correct treatment.

By the way, this part about the recptionist, Acapulco, etc. was entirely
made up.  But he did say the thing about Prozac-responsive syndrome and
(worse) "I'm running a business not a charity."  The title and first line of
the poem was taken from a poem about AIDS by Paul Monette, a poem that I
admire very much.  Monette's autobiographical book are well known, but his
poetry is not and is quite excellent.  At the time I wrote the poem, I was
taking a poetry class in which we were asked to write a poem using the first
line from another poem.

Tim,

Stein always thought she wrote in the most natural way. I don't think how the
public took or ignored her writing had much to do with her wishes. I think
there is a crucial gap between how a writer sees his/her work (his/her imagined
audience) and the discource which starts (if any at all) around the work. The
gap is profound and not much talked about directly or analyzed.

I do not agree with your association of the avant-garde with net-working.
Though with the Russian futurists or Appolinaire or the Dadaists the avant-garde
was a movement containing factions -by the way, all three of the mentioned
ones initiated by non-Western Europeans- the relationship is not really
networking.

Nick Piambino and I had this discussion on the list about a year ago. Nick
believes, if I understand him correctly, that writers should psychologically
support each other forming a community. Though this sounds wonderful, I do not
think that is how writing is done, particularly poetry. Since poetry in monetary
terms has almost no social recompense, its only value, it seems to me, is the
writing of it.

I am not privileging anything or rejecting the desire of the public. My point
is that the image of audience the poet develops during the process of
writing, phenomenologically, has little to do with the actual potential audience,
whether this audience is the establishment or the avant-garde. etal.

I am very interested in the chasm that exists between the consciousness of
the individual poet writing the poem, his or her sense of language, and the
culture -a lot of it non linguistic- which surrounds it, which might receive or
ignore the work. How does the poet live with that flaw? I went into this in
great detail in my essay "Questions of Accent."

Murat

 It was contentious -as much against each other as against society- more than
cooperative.

Today, it seems to me, the avant-garde is a style more than a movement. It
has developed its own vocabulary of what a poem is or can be. Within those
givens, the idea of net-working

when he read at the black sparrow reading here in LA he read from desire
-- his comment was that bs stopped publishing him after that book
because he became more experimental and they rejected that -- but since
it was his last one with them it was the one he liked most

so he wants a collection that's more of a survey of all his work, but I
think isn't holding out much hope for a collected, but rather a
comprehensive new & selected

Subject:      Wallace Stevens and Confessionalism
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

This recent thread about the various strains of confessionalism has =
piqued my interest, especially because I was just at the recent Wallace =
Stevens Conference, held at UConn over the weekend, and the afternoon =
discussion denigrated/evolved into something quite acrimonious on this =
very subject, though it was never overtly defined as such. After a =
variety of papers on such topics as the latent eroticism of Stevens' =
floribunda, the curious resistance of British poets to his work, the =
proliferation of verbs of being in his otherwise variegated clauses, the =
aural dimension of his use of place names, etc., etc., there was an =
afternoon panel on "The Next 50 Years," a discussion that, ostensibly, =
would forecast Stevens' influence on contemporary poetry in the years to =
come. The panelists were John Serio, editor of the Wallace Stevens =
Journal, Massimo Bacigalupo, Stevens' Italian translator, Willard =
Spiegelman, Susan Howe, and Christian Wiman, the new, young editor of =
Poetry.=20

Serio spoke of how the journal has evolved over time, and the many =
essays, good and awful, he has rec'd since its inception, encompassing =
all the possible -isms, plus the mediums of visual art, music, dance, =
even architecture. Bacigalupo spoke about the challenges of translating =
Stevens into another language, mentioning that, counterintuitively, =
Stevens was actually easier to translate than someone like Frost, =
because he was less embedded in the cultural landscape of a particular =
country/time and more abstracted in his ruminations. Spiegelman spoke =
about the poets who've retained a measure of Stevensian language, that =
if Ashbery can be seen as absorbing much of it, then contemporary poetry =
itself is necessarily rife with our insurance man's "tink and tank and =
tunk-a-tunk-tunk." Howe compared Stevens to Jonathan Edwards, averring =
that in a secular world, poetry was his religion, and she stressed the =
need for new editions of his work, more complete correspondence, the =
marginalia in his books, his unexpurgated diaries, etc. And then, Wiman, =
whom I hadn't met before, began his comment with the following =
invective, "If Wallace Stevens is influential fifty years from now, then =
the break between American poets and the world will be complete." He =
followed this by railing against Stevens' self-absorption, his inability =
to engage with the world in a meaningful way. He claimed that Stevens =
was a corrosive influence on modern poetry, a near-solipsistic, =
obsessive genius who had lost touch with what existed outside language, =
and that what he, as the new editor of Poetry, was interested in was =
poems that have people and places in them, that touch and stem from =
emotional and lyrical roots. What went unsaid, I think, was that he was =
advocating a kind of confessionalism; the poetry that is driven by =
people and places is generally written by a person in a place, someone =
who is localized and situated in a vocable, stable identity. Anyway, you =
can imagine the clamor that such a comment caused, the proverbial =
Christian sacrificing himself to the lions, and Susan - bless her - =
declaimed, "If you have a problem with Wallace Stevens, I have a problem =
with Poetry magazine and have for many years." It was all very tense and =
rancorous and selfishly, rather fun to be privy to, though I wonder, =
notions of confessionalism aside or perhaps foregrounded, what folks =
make of Wallace Stevens on the 125th anniversary of his birth.=20

murat, i address specific poems in many cases to specific
individuals, and specific communities (largely through issues/ideas,
but also in some cases in terms of form)... the latter certainly do
(at least) inflect my writing process... if this is a working
fiction, it's one that's nonetheless actualized somewhat, for
instance, when i read the work aloud for said individuals/communities
(i don't mean to give undue credit to the aural---i just mean to
introduce it here)... i'm certain too that i accumulate recognition
(some will say symbolic and cultural capital) in doing so...

how does this square, or not, with your phenomenology?...

best,

Well Wiman claimed he too had a problem with Poetry magazine and hoped =
to change its prevailing direction. He's been the editor for about six =
months and I can't say I've looked too closely at the journal recently. =
Though when someone else asked him which poets he did admire, all he =
came up with were Frost, Yeats, and Heaney.=20

Stephen Ellis --in addition his essay on Lisa Jarnot--has also written a
a lot of poetry, and quite  a range of it.  I am particular fond of his
poem ZENTITH in his chapbook INTERFACE. I'll just quote the beginning:

The crusader ruins at Apollonia
shine.  You can almost taste

that limestone's ancient blaze,
the desire to take Jerusalem

now turned absence, salted away
on those far shores. History

Hi David

yes, Yeats' views were not unique to his generation, one does not only have
to hit the 'modernists' on the head about this, investigate what H.G. Wells
or Shaw actually thought and it is a quite uncomfortable experience. Yeats
though did have the unique position among that lot of becoming an elected
politician and his record there is not good. It is all a horror: Pound
craving audiences with Mussolini, Wallace Stevens regarding Taft as a
dangerous radical, Eliot siding with the brain-dead hierarchy of the
Anglican Church, Lowell invoking old men sleeping over the Aeneid, while
simultaneously being a conscientious objector, Auden faking Marxism while
living on private means then conveniently switching to an equally fake
religiosity when changing Britain for the US. You could also switch to
Wells's interview with Stalin, where they talked about the possibilities of
the Babbage machine. In the eighteenth century computers were people,
usually female.

I quite agree with you about Joyce, that scaramag was the only with a true
integrity, self-pitying bastard that he was! The rhetorical power of The
Second Coming is very strong, and I admire it on that basis, but remain
aware that it is rhetoric.

That is to say: politician talk.

Best

OK, so Yeats had contemptible views.  So did Eliot, Pound, etc. (though not,
I
hasten to add, Joyce -- at least here).  "The Second Coming" retains its
appeal
partly because it can't hide the undercurrent of awe in the sublime horror
of
the rough beast.  The sense that one doesn't know what to expect.

I imagine Rummy, Bremer, Cheney, Wolfowitz etc. are much like the hapless
falconer.  (Bush 43, meanwhile, is like the falconer's stupid dog chasing a

butterfly into the bushes.)

"Horror" isn't the word that occurs to me.  It's somewhat disingenuous to
throw one's hands up in despair because poets can sometimes be less than
admirable human beings.  There's possibly an interesting discussion there,
but if it begins with wide-ranging condemnations of the moral flakiness of
poets it's not going to reveal anything beyond the opinions of the
interlocutor, which seem to me of minimal interest.

James Kelman draws an interesting distinction when he says that he believes
that some writers are not so good as artists because of their bigotries,
which inevitably show up as blindnesses in the work.  But I think this has
to be applied with considerable subtlety and specific argument if it is not
to degenerate into moralising on writers not being saints.  It could easily
be argued, for example, that Pound had considerable "integrity", for all the
distastefulness of some of his ideas.  I know I keep going on about Said,
but I think his criticisms of Conrad or Austen or Swift are models of
literary argument which investigate the politics of the writer.

Btw, there's scuttlebutt on Joyce too, all the gossip about his daughter.
Are we going to drag that in to condemn his writing?  And politicians, at
least the ones I see on tv or read in the newspapers, sound nothing like
Yeats.  It might be more interesting if they did.

Best

Dear Listmembers:

I have been lurking with interest for some time. I would like, as my  =
first public foray, to announce the Summer Writing Workshops I direct at =
NYU.

This summer the guest writers will be

John Yau -- poetry

Siri Hustvedt -- fiction

Dave Hickey -- non fiction.

Each of these writers has an interest in visual art as well as in =
language.=20

The workshops run from June 13-June 25 and are open to undergraduate =
students (for credit) postgraduate students (non credit). Students can =
earn four credits.

Admission to the workshops is by application. An application consists of =
a ten page writing sample and cover letter. E mail me for details.

In addition to working in small groups with a guest writer (groups are =
no larger than twelve) students attend lectures and readings, present =
their own work, go to panel discussions.

In addition the students participate in improvisation workshops which I =
teach along with my colleagues. We use a variety of approaches -- =
Oulipean, Cagean, surrealist, and so on -- to experiment with language.=20

You may be interested; you may have students who are interested.

My e mail is rd2@nyu.edu.

I would so appreciate it if you could spread the work to your networks.=20

Thanks so much,

Ruth Danon

Murat:

"Networking" might sound a little too corporate, but my point was
simply that you can't be "avant-garde" by yourself.  As Peter Burger
and others argue, one thing the avant-garde did was to challenge the
usual idea of individual creation or of the individual work.  What
the avant-garde critique might show is how the individual writer who
believes she or he simply creates a work and then releases it into
the world--which then judges it aesthetically good or bad--really
operates within a set of ideologically grounded institutions.  If one
follows this logic, an avant-garde that has become merely a
style--with no connection to an alternative sense of literary
community--is no longer an avant-garde.

A network doesn't rule out conflict--it's more like a field within
and against which one positions oneself.

I think your definition of "culture" must be rather narrower than
mine, since it's hard for me to understand how there could be such a
radical gap between a writer and "the culture."  One can oppose
certain political principles, literary standards, even certain kinds
of identifications, but can one really be outside culture?  Does it
make sense to set up a binary between the writer and "culture"?  I
guess my feeling is that such an idea--as I suggested before--can
prevent one from seeing how culturally and ideologically implicated
one always is.

I am curious as to how you would say your position differs from the
basic idea that authors can't control the reception of their own
texts--that there's a gap between intention and reception.  Is this
really a "flaw" in the process, or simply a fact about any kind of
language?  And if the writer, indeed, forms her or his own "sense of
language" and imagined audience, the reaction of any actual audience
should have no impact whatsoever on the composition of the work, even
if the writer is totally wrong about who the audience is.  I guess
what I'm asking is whether you're presenting this dynamic of
production and reception as truly flawed, and if so, what the ideal
version of it would be for you--a world, say, in which texts are only
read according to the intentions of their authors?--and whether this
is meant to be a corrective taken to heart by writers, by readers, or
both.

best,
Tim

Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge

CALL FOR PAPERS - Open Issue

Since 2001, Rhizomes has promoted experimental work
located outside current disciplines, work that has no proper
location.  We encourage migrations into new conceptual
territories resulting from unpredictable juxtapositions.  We
are currently accepting submission for Rhizomes #9, an
open topic issue.

Due date for submissions:  01 October 2004

As a full text online periodical, Rhizomes emphasizes
multimedia to foster imaginative work that challenges typical
critical forms.  While submissions need not necessarily
include developed multimedia, authors should consider
how their work might be enhanced by elements specific to
the online medium.  Contributors may work with editors and
technical staff to establish a more effective online
presentation, for example, by providing relevant image
and/or audio files as well as specialized instances of code.

Rhizomes engages in a collaborative review process.  In
addition to an initial screen by the editors, contributions will
undergo a "blind" review by at least two members of the
editorial board.

Interested parties are highly encouraged to review the
Rhizomes website ^=D6 located at www.rhizomes.net ^=D6 to gain
familiarity with the various styles and subjects of previous
journal issues.  As our name suggests, works written in the
spirit of Deleuzian approaches are welcomed but not
required.

Co-Editors:  Ellen Berry and  Carol Siegel
Review Editor:  Craig Saper

All submissions to Rhizomes should conform to standards
for citation that govern publications in the author's field and
should include a bibliography, if appropriate.  We will
consider short pieces but typically do not consider texts of
more than 7500 words, including notes.  Any queries about
potential submissions for the open issue are welcome.

I picked up a copy of Alan Halsey's _Wittgenstein's Devil_ (Stride, 2000)
this past weekend and have been repeatedly blown away by the work in this
book. Is everyone else here in the states aware of his work and I've just
been kept in the dark, or is it that, as I imagine, he's been ignored here
in the States because he's a Brit? What about you other Anglophones?
Familiar with Halsey's work?

Brian C.

...very interesting what Ravi Shankar mentions about his recent foray =
into the Wallace Stevens conference...I think RS is delineating a =
faultline that obviously still exists to a certain extent in American =
poetry between the aw shucks school of huh? and those who read Stevens =
(or past tense read) with a small amount of glee, astonishment, what =
have you...I'm not talking about Stevens' politics btw, simply his =
wordplay...

...the comment by the new editor of Poetry regarding Stevens' 'inability =
to engage with the world in a meaningful way' is positively glorious.=20

What is the source of this peculiarly American malady, i.e. complete =
lack of imagination?  The other comment that poems 'should have people =
in places in them' made my day.=20

I'm no huge fan of Stevens' work but I think it's wonderful that folks =
are still 'arguing' about it.

And then, Wiman, =3D
whom I hadn't met before, began his comment with the following =3D
invective, "If Wallace Stevens is influential fifty years from now, then =
=3D
the break between American poets and the world will be complete." He =3D
followed this by railing against Stevens' self-absorption, his inability =
=3D
to engage with the world in a meaningful way. He claimed that Stevens =
=3D
was a corrosive influence on modern poetry, a near-solipsistic, =3D
obsessive genius who had lost touch with what existed outside language, =
=3D
and that what he, as the new editor of Poetry, was interested in was =3D
poems that have people and places in them, that touch and stem from =3D
emotional and lyrical roots. What went unsaid, I think, was that he was =
=3D
advocating a kind of confessionalism; the poetry that is driven by =3D
people and places is generally written by a person in a place, someone =
=3D
who is localized and situated in a vocable, stable identity. Anyway, you =
=3D
can imagine the clamor that such a comment caused, the proverbial =3D
Christian sacrificing himself to the lions, and Susan - bless her - =3D
declaimed, "If you have a problem with Wallace Stevens, I have a problem =
=3D
with Poetry magazine and have for many years." It was all very tense and =
=3D
rancorous and selfishly, rather fun to be privy to, though I wonder, =3D
notions of confessionalism aside or perhaps foregrounded, what folks =3D
make of Wallace Stevens on the 125th anniversary of his birth.=3D20

it is not a matter of the moral flakiness of artists but rather the
socio-political import of much of the literature of stature of the early
part of the twentieth century: the Yeats poem at the start of this is a
magnificent piece of right wing political rhetoric, Yeats goes out of his
way in a note to the poem in his Collected to reassure 'conservative
readers' of its import, that the generalised imagery of parts of the poem
have been taken to mean all sorts of other things is a moot case of the way
literature bounces around. These problems abound in the Anglo-American
literature of the period, they apply just as much to Wells or Shaw as Yeats
or Pound. In Pound's justly celebrated high point in the Pisan Cantos 'Pull
down thy vanity' applies to anyone who doesn't agree with Pound and his
devotion to the 'twice-crucified' (Mussolini) not to Pound, who, as Cyril
Connoly observed, never gets to Pisa in that poem. It's not a matter of
condemning the writing but of being aware of the import of it, an import
that would cause great discomfort if held explicitly by people now.

"Horror" isn't the word that occurs to me.  It's somewhat disingenuous to
throw one's hands up in despair because poets can sometimes be less than
admirable human beings.  There's possibly an interesting discussion there,
but if it begins with wide-ranging condemnations of the moral flakiness of
poets it's not going to reveal anything beyond the opinions of the
interlocutor, which seem to me of minimal interest.

James Kelman draws an interesting distinction when he says that he believes
that some writers are not so good as artists because of their bigotries,
which inevitably show up as blindnesses in the work.  But I think this has
to be applied with considerable subtlety and specific argument if it is not
to degenerate into moralising on writers not being saints.  It could easily
be argued, for example, that Pound had considerable "integrity", for all the
distastefulness of some of his ideas.  I know I keep going on about Said,
but I think his criticisms of Conrad or Austen or Swift are models of
literary argument which investigate the politics of the writer.

Btw, there's scuttlebutt on Joyce too, all the gossip about his daughter.
Are we going to drag that in to condemn his writing?  And politicians, at
least the ones I see on tv or read in the newspapers, sound nothing like
Yeats.  It might be more interesting if they did.

That was (to an extent) my point.  You originally seemed to be making
another one, which was rather more simplistic.

And which "people" are you referring to, here?  I seem to be reading quite a
lot of contemporary stuff which is very comfortable with explicit right wing
ideas.  Or are human beings with questionable political views not "people"?
Tempting to think so, perhaps, but I suspect they are.

Quoting "Shankar, Ravi (English)" <ShankarR@MAIL.CCSU.EDU>:

Isn't there enough of that type of poetry being written in the US today? Would
that type of poetry fall into the Billy Collins School of Embodied Ironic
Poetics? I thought I had read that, to paraphrase, Poetry had a new editor who
was making bold editorial ~changes~. I guess Wiman's changes are as oblique as
Bush's defense of his mistake-free administration's actions since 9/11.

Homewrecker: An Atlas of Illicit Love
Edited by Daphne Gottlieb
Published by Soft Skull Press

Payment: $100 for fiction or non-fiction, $35 for poetry, plus a copy of =
anthology

We live in a culture founded on transgressive desire (apple, serpent, =
party of five) even as it insists on suppressing it. What does it mean =
when our most sought-after emotional state -- being beloved - comes into =
direct conflict with our most deeply ingrained values - being honest - =
in our most prized relationships? When desire is aroused, what are the =
consequences as it is silenced, twisted, suppressed, subverted or =
fulfilled? And what happens next? What happens in the transformation of =
lover to liar? And what do we do when the lies we've been told rip apart =
everything we have known about love?

Although recent estimates insist that half of all women and men have =
cheated in their relationships, the climate of silence surrounding such =
behavior (except in the lowest forms of popular culture and in =
conjunction with major public figures) would have us believe that =
affairs are an anomaly.=20

In a post-queer, post-nuclear family age, the "affair" looks different =
from media representations-that is to say, what's violated may not be =
the marital bond, and the betrayal may not be a sexual one. Homewrecker =
will explore the adulteration of the ways we live, and the adulterous =
ways we don't want to admit to living. Homewrecker will explore the =
emotional intensity and complexity that affairs entail: euphoric, =
unapologetic, guilty, torn, ashamed, unrepentant, creative, insatiable, =
self-loathing and many more - sometimes all at once, and from a =
multitude of perspectives. The anthology will also examine what is =
destabilized by the affair -- (heterosexual) pair bonding and the =
nuclear family - and the consequences for those who challenge it.

We're looking for fiction, non-fiction and poetry:

=B7 by and about homewreckers, the homewrecked, and the society that =
creates them.=20
=B7 that illuminates uneasy topics with artful, edgy literature.=20
=B7 that explores the emotional terrain and impact of infidelity without =
cheap moralizing=20
=B7 that breaks the institutional silence around affairs=20
=B7 that contradicts popular culture's one-dimensional representations =
of 'homewreckers', 'philanderers' and 'clueless spouses', as well as the =
flat excuses of 'boredom' and 'midlife crises'=20
=B7 that interrogates the social policing of and pandering to desire;
=B7 that destabilizes the constructed opposition of loyalty and desire =
as it is socially manifested;
=B7 that mines the revolutionary and utopian possibilities of =
transgressive desire.

Basically, we want work about all the different, forbidden ways your =
heart has been broken or breaks for the people forbidden to it. If =
you're brave enough to give it up, we might be brave enough to publish =
it.

Anthlogy submission criteria:

=B7 fiction: no more than 25 double-spaced pages or 7,500 words
=B7 nonfiction: must be for a general audience, not a scholarly one. No =
more than 25 double-spaced pages or 7,500 words
=B7 poetry: no more than 10 pages or 5 poems
=B7 submissions will be accepted by email (rich text / jpeg / pdf)
=B7 all submissions must include your name, brief biographical =
statement, address, telephone numbers, and email / web address
=B7 submission queries are welcome
=B7 no simultaneous submissions

Slought Foundation presents "Public override void," a vault installation
featuring Jim Carpenter's Electronic Text Composition (ETC) project, on
display from April 17-May 20, 2004. The opening reception on Thursday
April 29, 2004 from 6:30-8:30pm has been organized in conjunction with a
live presentation by Carpenter and a public conversation between Bob
Perelman, Nick Montfort, and Jean-Michel Rabat=E9 (50 min). The=20
installation
includes self-service poetry stations and wall panels of code, and takes
its name ("Public override void") from an actual string of code embedded
in the software program. Information on the public conversation is
available: http://slought.org/content/11199/

The Electronic Text Composition Project's Poetry Engine is a suite of
software components that allow a user to generate aesthetic texts.=20
Drawing
word associations from its language database, the Engine's grammar uses=20=

a
probability-based approach to constructing syntactic constituents, which
it aggregates into utterances, which it in turn aggregates into
compositions. The project postulates that the construction of its texts
does not actually occur within the software-these constructions, absent
authorial intent and divorced from any underlying message, assume their
status as poems only as they are read. The process of textual=20

is firmly situated within the reader, not the software. Over the last=20
year
a dozen poems composed with the Poetry Engine's aid and submitted under
the pen name Erica T. Carter have been accepted for publication in a
number of little magazines and literary journals. As evidence of the
project's success (or perhaps indicative of its failure), one editor
accepted a poem with the comment, "I found your works intriguing, but=20

Condensation Cube of 1963-65, on display from April 17-May 20, 2004.=20

http://slought.org/content/21085/

In his early work, artist Hans Haacke was concerned with systems and
processes. His Condensation Cube of 1963-65 [Clear acrylic, water,=20
light,
air currents, temperature, climate in exhibition situation; 30 x 30 x 30
cm; Collection of Edward Fry and Sandra Ericson] demonstrates the
dependency of a relatively closed system on the environment in which it=20=

is
situated: changes in temperature lead to the evaporation of water and=20
its
condensation on sidewalls of the cube. Haacke's condensation cube is a
pedagogical tool still pertinent to understanding conceptual art and
contemporary life. Questions to consider include: how does one frame or
contextualize a work such as the condensation cube? What are its=20
contents?
To what degree is the cube a screen on which we can project our
interpretations? Can this box be understood as a storage device, and if
so, what is it storing?

Brian,

There's a bit of a Halsey fan club out here in the Bay Area, where he's
read several times recently. I'm similarly staggered by the work in
Wittgenstein's Devil -- and if you can find them, you really should
check out his two "historical" books, The Text of Shelley's Death and A
Robin Hood Book. I'm glad to hear other U.S. readers have managed to
find him.

I think he and Laura Moriarty might be at work on a collaborative
project as well, bits of which I've seen in xerox, but which I don't
think has been published anywhere. One to watch for.

Galería de la Raza, Latino Arts Network, New Langton Arts the Poetry
Center at San Francisco State University, Small Press Traffic, and UC
Davis Program in Creative Writing present a series of events to
celebrate the publication of a new anthology highlighting the work of
emerging Mexican women poets.  These
bilingual, bi-cultural events at different sites throughout the Bay Area
offer the local poetry community a rare opportunity to hear the work of
and engage in
conversation with two Mexico-based poets, Dolores Dorantes and Laura
Solórzano, featured in Sin puertas visibles: An Anthology of Contemporary
Poetry by Mexican Women (University of Pittsburgh Press and Ediciones
Sin Nombre, 2003), along with the translator and editor of the
anthology, poet Jen Hofer.

At a time when cultures often meet in conflict, these events offer a
meeting ground for U.S. American and Mexican culture based on curiosity
and collaboration.  Hofer organized the weekend of exchange to expose
Bay Area readers to adventurous new writing by women who work at the
margins of their national literary traditions. Dorantes and Solórzano,
on a rare trip to the United States, represent different styles and
approaches, while sharing a commitment to innovative uses of language
and adventurous modes of expression.  Informal discussion, panels and
readings over three days promise to confound any limiting preconceptions
about what "women's writing" or "Mexican writing" might be, sparking new
and deeper cross-cultural conversations.

Hi Taylor,

Thanks, that's good to know. I actually picked up the book in SF, at City Lights (was visiting there for a weekend with friends and an A's game). I've been working on prose poems and poems for several years, attempting to merge the language of various scientific and other cultural disciplines in the poems, but clearly Halsey is light years ahead of me. Rupert Loydell also mentioned the Robin Hood book to me, so I'm off to look it up...

In case anyone was wondering about the supposed credibility of the Bremer/US
appointed Governing Council. Internationally - and one may hope domestically
- the UN's assessment (below) has to be taken as huge indictment of the sham
of Bush & Company's "commitment to Freedom in Iraq."  My sense last night of
Bush's twisting and turning of essentially a scatter punch of the same few
phrases over and over again was sign of a rigid man in deep panic.  Which -
pre-November - might compel him and his mad cronies to put us all in the
scariest place of all.  Need to stay vigilant and contest every move.

U.N. Envoy Calls for Caretaker Government to Take Power in Iraq Before
Elections
Brahimi Says U.S.-Picked Governing Council Should Be Dissolved on June 30

By Hamza Hendawi
The Associated Press
Wednesday, April 14, 2004; 12:58 PM


BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Iraq should dissolve the U.S.-picked Governing Council and
set up a caretaker government of respected Iraqis to lead the country from
the U.S. handover of power on June 30 until elections set for Jan. 31, U.N.
envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said Wednesday.


The caretaker government would be led by a prime minister and include a
president and two vice presidents. It must include "Iraqi men and women
known for their honesty, integrity and competence," Brahimi said.

This Arp seems apt.
-------
The Tyrolian Elephant
by Jean Arp

translation by Millie Niss

 It cries, it grinds.  The Tyrolian elephant and the rubber grandmother hit
the piano of death.  They take turns hitting it, without a break, to break
everything.  They foam at the mouth, they sweat.  Their paws transform the
piano of death into cast iron. As there is nothing left of the piano under
their hands, they rub the billions of time, accumulate electric tripe in
zeppelins, crown flies, and eat salted little children, phosphorus oranges
and airplane marmalade.  The rubber grandmother smokes a cigar like a
grandmother.  She makes cries of joy.  The rubber grandmother has sex-appeal
and at her appeal the diabolic and flavored mushroom throws itself in a
terrifying motion towards the rubber grandmother whom he licks without
stopping, one arm after the other.   Don't you have anything else under your
mouth?  The pleasure is great.  The grandmother grows.  Continue, diabolical
and flavored mushroom!  Continue!  Go beyond yourself, terrifying and
sweetened crocodile!  The joy is great.  The Tyrolian elephant is
diplomatic.  He says only ruah, ruah, ruah.  But because the diabolical and
flavored mushroom doesn't go beyond itself, the rubber grandmother throws
him off like a fly without legs into a lake of grease, grinding her teeth:
Marmalade, marmalade, everything is marmalade.  The fall of a naval boat
into sweetened milk stops the nudity of this majestic dance.

Your claim appears to be that "the only value in poetry is the act of
writing a poem."  Much of my response is in response to this claim.

1.  Your ideal perspective of a poet and his or her work purposefully
slights the world in which a poet writes.  You aren't the only one to
purchase such idealism; thankfully, the rebuttals are vast and more
substantial.  Off the top of my head, Mary Robinson's "The Poet's
Garret" (1806).

2. We typically refer to populated places in our world as societies no
matter what our positions are concerning the value of community.
Therefore, writing a poem always has a specifiable social recompense in
that poems respond.  If we agree that recompense, a verb, is to "make
amends," and that its context assumes a purposeful address to a loss.
Recompense is a payment in return for something.

3.  A poem is, in many ways, a payment in return for something.  Even
if I feel I can write from an ideal place of pure invention, my poem
still would be a result of beholding or viewing something in the world.
  That a reader and writer can discuss that beholding also presupposes a
kind of social recompense being attended to, whether it be based in
fear or anxiety or mastery.

4.  A poem is a response to being in the world.  I suppose if labor is
abstracted from the poem and a specific monetary value is applied to
it, then a whole social recompense may be lacking; though, even in this
case, it is a social recompense attempted.  Just because a poem is not
purchased does not mean it doesn't exist in commune, in society, as a
formal recompensive product.

This brings us to the concept of potentiality that you use in reference
to a phenomenological take on writing as a process.  (By the way, I am
wary of your reference to "the process"--I think such terminology
usually is a sign of begging an entire bag of questions.)

Murat continues:
> My point
> is that the image of audience the poet develops during the process of
> writing, phenomenologically, has little to do with the actual
> potential audience,
>


You beg the question about the meaning of the potentiality of being.  I
am using the language of phenomenology because you qualify your
argument with such a reference.

The poem itself cannot exist without a potentiality for a poet's being
in the world.  The actual audience for any given poem does not exist.
The poem as an object out there to be read represents a specific
potentiality for its being ready-at-hand.  When a poem is made
ready-at-hand, then a readership is intended and necessary.  We should
probably discuss access, but...  How they interpret your poem is not a
question that can be asked because such a question works through the
progress of a poem's reception backwards as if it always already has
been received.  But the image, the theory (those who know
greek--theoria is what I am referring to her,) the poet develops of an
audience has quite a bit to do with that poet's relationship to a
potential audience if only because the writer beholds the possibility
for an audience to exist.  This beholding of a possible audience, in
other words, is not a creation of a poet on his own outside of the
public.  The possibility for an audience and a poet's recognition of
such possibility is a falling into the public wherein the poet must
acknowledge his or her own being there with others.  Of course, this
acknowledgment can be inauthentic or naive or idealistic; nevertheless
it has a lot to with the potential audience.

The homogeneous public sphere of individuals chattering safely about a
poem, for example, is an ideologically convenient wish, because any
purposeful irruption into the public sphere is an expansion of its
actual heterogeneity.  In other words, your poem don't have a meaning
in the same way the key of A in a mixed orchestra sounds like A.  A
poem's entrance into being read is very much a giving up any
singularity that its producer may have wished upon it to a multiplicity
of meanings that consumes the poem and, in most cases, ignores the
poet.

I suppose you could claim to have knowledge of the first poem written
and knowledge of what that author had in mind and, then, make the claim
that what was in mind had nothing to do with potential readers but with
an entire OTHER phenomena that we have muddied up and called poetry...

I also find it impossible not to infer that you feel poets genuinely
control language when writing poems--that the poem is a product of
something intended to be as it is before it was.  If I am inferring
correctly, I disagree wholeheartedly.

So, now to the idea of "that flaw"

Murat writes:
> I am very interested in the chasm that exists between the
> consciousness of
> the individual poet writing the poem, his or her sense of language,
> and the
> culture -a lot of it non linguistic- which surrounds it, which might

Finally, I find your claim that "a lot" of the culture surrounding a
poem is "non-linguistic" suspect.  Your comment speaks more about your
disposition towards a potential audience outside of an ideal community
of poetry than it does about anything that is participated in while
reading poetry.  The reading-a-poem itself is linguistic and need not
be referred to technically as such to be such.  And poor poet that has
to live with that flaw!  Poor poet?  How about the poor reader who is
asked to trudge through the possibility for a good poem?  Looking at
the problem this way illustrates it absurdity.  A reader cannot
possibly expect a good read from something not yet read in the same way
a writer cannot expect a good reading from something not yet written.
This is what revision is about.  Whitman was a great revise-or.  Most
poets publish a book and leave the poems within as monuments for how IT
actually was at that time.  But poems ARE not were; therefore, we
should ask more of the poet.

Most untutored readers of poetry, as many of us are aware, read poetry
they can "get" as they read it.  They read poetry that is "readable."
I find such a restriction incredibly linguistic.  Such a requirement
shows a reader who has the ability to distinguish between the canny and
uncanny & the familiar and unfamiliar while reading verse--a formal use
of language a reader purposefully confronts with a "more or less than"
approach to knowledge.  I know no reader of poetry who claims to get it
when not getting it.  In other words, poetry is always approached never
attained.

Anyway, I am getting away from a simple fact:  Culture is always
linguistic.  (I am using the concept "linguistic" after your fashion
for context sake; we could use a better concept.)  What is a
"non-linguistic" aspect of culture, anyway?
What is flawed about the difference between poet and reader?
Also, your idealism pops into the inquiry again because you put,
without any reflection about it, the poet into the position of
understanding the linguistic--again, whatever you mean by linguistic, I
assume language is involved--in poetry.  Poets often don't see the half
of what they put into poems in language.  In other words, language
often speaks through the poem independent of the poet's intention.
Anybody has access to the product of such eruptions resulting from the
saturated phenomenon we refer to as a poem.

Possibly, the chasm you refer to is the liminal space where the energy
in poetry is expended.  Poetry, unlike the commodity form, is not part
of a closed system of exchange that is meant to work in a definable
manner.  Poetry is not up to the poet.  The poet and the reader, not
the poem and the money, are what is exchanged in relationship to
proximal positions in culture.  hence, a poet approaches a subject in
relation to a utilizable distance to its object.  Again, a poem is a
form of social recompense:  the poem is a manner of making up or making
amends in which a poet uses language to engage/exchange positions with
a reader.  Readers, after all, "do" poetry when they read a poem.

What point is it for a poet to bother with flaws in regard?  A poem is
always in the face of the other; it doesn't contain an accurate image
that a proper address has access to.

Well enough for now,

Get the idealism and realism out of the phenomenology of poetry.  Both
practices leaves much to be desired other than starting points:

1. realism holds that the reality of the world not only needs to be
proved but is capable of proof.
2. idealism is a practice that often fails to clarify what the object
of its understanding means ontologically, how such an understanding in
possible, and so any interpretation of the object of understanding will
always be an empty interpretation.

With poetry we have the real object, a poem, and we have the poetic
ideal, The Poem.  Murat, I see your discussion begging the question of
how we see and talk about and refer to and use the relationship between
an ideal thing and the thing itself.  It isn't at all as matter-of-fact
and perspectival as you make it.  You certainly have an explicitly
pejorative use for culture that I don't buy.  I am more in line with
Tim's comments concerning culture itself.

At any rate, poems are not written in seclusion.  In fact,  I find that
they are always solicited.


cheers,
Gary Norris

ps: for those who worry about attributions--I am in dialogue with
Heidegger from Chapter Six, Division One of _Being in Time_ with my
definitions of idealism and realism.

This is a very difficult question, Alison, and one which troubles me much.
Now I do not claim to any kind of moral superiority on this, I am painfully
aware of the petty deceits, failures of lovingness, shirking of humanity,
etc etc that  I am capable of. I often meet, more than I would like, people
with very right wing views, some of them  I like as human beings, despite
what they say, some scare the wits out of me. The 'people' is a nebulous
concept, s'pose it means something like 'those we talk to' but I'm not happy
with that definition.

That was (to an extent) my point.  You originally seemed to be making
another one, which was rather more simplistic.

And which "people" are you referring to, here?  I seem to be reading quite a
lot of contemporary stuff which is very comfortable with explicit right wing
ideas.  Or are human beings with questionable political views not "people"?
Tempting to think so, perhaps, but I suspect they are.

Excuse any x-posting, please

CFP: DLB American Poets of the 21st Century (deadline various; collection)

I am seeking contributors for The Dictionary of Literary Biography volume on
“American Poets of the 21st Century,” a reference work about poets and their
lives and careers.  The series is widely available in libraries and if you
are unfamiliar with the series, I suggest you look at the volumes concerning
American Poets since World War II, edited by R.S. Gwynn and Joseph Conte to
give you an idea of the format.  You should also consult the web site of the
publisher, Bruccoli Clark Layman for further information:
http://www.bcl-manly.com

Essays range from 4000-8000 words and will include the poets listed below.
I inherited this volume from a previous editor, and one requirement is that
there be no repeats of poets covered in previous volumes. If you are
interested, please send me a brief cv and the names of three or four poets
you are interested in writing about as soon as possible by e-mail: Richard
Flynn rflynn@georgiasouthern.edu.  Contributors receive a small honorarium
and a copy of the volume as payment.

U.C. Berkeley is pleased to announce a bilingual reading
by 2 contemporary Mexican women poets

Tuesday, April 27=20
7 pm=20
on the UC Berkeley Campus
Wheeler Hall, Room 330 (third floor)

Dolores Dorantes=20

was born in C=F3rdoba, Veracruz in 1973. Her most recent books include
SexoPUROsexoVELOZ (Cuadernos del filodecaballo, 2002), Para Bernardo: un ec=
o
(MUB editoraz, 2000) and Poemas para ni=F1os (Ediciones El Tuc=E1n de Virginia,
1999). She is a founding editor of Editorial Frugal, which counts among its
activities publication of the monthly broadside series Hoja Frugal, printed
in editions of 4000 and distributed free throughout Mexico. She lives in
Ciudad Ju=E1rez, where she works as a freelance writer and editor.

Laura Sol=F3rzano=20

was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco in 1961. She is the author, most recently,
of lobo de labio (Cuadernos de filodecaballos, Guadalajara: 2001) and
Semilla de Ficus (Ediciones Rimbaud, Tlaxcala: 1999). She is on the
editorial board of the literary arts magazine Tragaluz, and currently
teaches film studies and writing at the Centro de Arte Audiovisual in
Guadalajara.
=20
The poets will be introduced by their translator, the poet Jen Hofer, edito=
r
and translator of the groundbreaking Sin puertas visibles: An Anthology of
Contemporary Poetry by Mexican Women (published by University of Pittsburgh
Press and Ediciones Sin Nombre, 2003).

Sin puertas visibles (No Visible Doors) is a bilingual anthology of poetry
featuring the work of emerging women poets whose writing exists at the most
exciting margins of Mexican literary hierarchies. All three poets
represented here have had at least one book published in Mexico, yet none o=
f
their work has been translated into English until now.

Although Mexico is home to one of Latin America's most important poetic
traditions, the breadth and range of contemporary Mexican poetry are
virtually unknown to readers north of the border. These poems are by turns
meditative and explosive, sensuous and inventive, ironic and tender; in
short, they are subversive, provocative, bold. Reflecting the diversity and
complexity of Mexican poetry, they provide a taste of the adventurous new
writing infusing the tradition today.

"One of the most exciting anthologies of poetry in any language, translatio=
n
or original, that I have seen in recent years."-Forrest Gander

"An exceptional anthology that illustrates the many different realms throug=
h
which emerging poetry written by women ventures. . . . An extraordinary
book."-Beatriz Escalante

"[Hofer's] translations are both artistically daring and rigorously precise=
,
true recreations that could only have been realized by someone who possesse=
s
a similarly unique poetic vision and language in her own right."-Pura
L=F3pez-Colom=E9

"Poetry can both comfort and confront. It can unite. It can divide. While it
is not uncommon to read sweeping optimistic statements about poetry being
all about love or poetry being all about countering the oblivion of darkness
or poetry being the genre to comfort, it does a lot of other things as well.
It has many different roles. And a special role in times of crisis."
    --Juliana Spahr

"Is poetry enough?  Poetry in a Time of Crisis" is a day-long event
exploring the special role of poetry in times of crisis, including the
crises evoked by the so-called "war on terror" and the "culture wars"
focused on the LGBT community.   Eileen Myles (poet, UCSD professor, and
1992 Presidential candidate) will read from her work and discuss queer
writing as a form of resistance.  Juliana Spahr  (author of Fuck You-Aloha-I
Love You and Mills College professor) will lead a panel entitled "Poetry in
a Time of Crisis" that will investigate the relation between poetry and
crisis in an international context with examples from Korean, Mexican, and
Pacific poetries. Leslie Scalapino (prolific author of books including
Dahlia's Iris and publisher of O Books) will lead a discussion of poets
anthologized in a book she co-edited, entitled enough and her forthcoming
magazine War and Peace.  The editorial basis of both publications is that
the art of these poets and artists is not separate from their being in the
world.  Seeing what is happening is a form of change. There will be a
student reading, a reception, and a gala evening reading/performance by all
poet-panelists and Nate Mackey.

Sponsors: The Porter College Hitchcock Poetry Fund, Cultural Studies Poetry
Research Cluster, The National Endowment for the Arts, and 'A'A Arts.

There will be a prize for the best student poem that relates to the event
theme. All students are invited to write and read an original poem during
the student open mic at 6:00. Contact Roxi Hamilton (Hamilton@ucsc.edu) for
more details.


Schedule:

Saturday, April 17 Porter College Dining Hall:

2-3:00:  "Queer writing as resistance." Eileen Myles reads & discusses her
work.

3-4:15:  Panel I:  "Poetry in a Time of Crisis."  Moderator Juliana Spahr.
Panelists:  Rob Wilson, Heriberto Yepez, and Walter Lew.

4:30-5:45:  Panel II:  "Is Poetry enough?"  Moderator Leslie Scalapino.

The Projects Reading Series is a new reading series curated by Kreg =
Hasegawa.  This reading series plans on showcasing poetry, prose, and =
symposia.  The poets and other writers featured will be a way for the =
hard working folk here and around the country to have a place to read.  =
Readings are scheduled around the writer=92s schedule and not based on =
any Julian calendar system.  Joshua Clover and Ange Mlinko will be the =
first readers of this series.  Both are wonderful, active poets of the =
youngish sort.  See below for their bios and a new poem each.  Both will =
be in town for the Pop Conference at EMP.  The readings are free of =
charge and are sponsored by the kind artists/gallery operators at 1506 =
Projects (where the old Fallout Records used to be).  I=92m very excited =
and lucky to present Joshua Clover and Ange Mlinko.  Please join us!

Back when maps were dangerous it was seditious

To give one to a foreigner; feeling so perfectly calligraphic that,

Implying the limp like an iamb superceded what was said of one

By the words themselves, one slyly wrote across the desert,

=20

Allaying the panic took a device to craft a presence.

To say, in search of a role, that a double bend in the river

Was a perimeter of repatriation,

We tried that of believers, like quoted back to itself

=20

The wilderness took shape; the stars were of where

Two had met, in honeydew shadow, and made maps praise.

JOHN COLLETTI is the author of THE NEW NORMALCY (Boog Literature, 2003).

various and deeply felt stance against the much touted and troubling
notion of " the new normalcy." John lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

"shocking pink"):

"Jean Cocteau, ferocious insect, tell us, if you know, how new

gary, while i appreciate the rigor with which you're approaching this
issue, let me offer just a simple observation, which may be something
more than a friendly amendment, but is meant as friendly in any case
(and i understand, too, that you're attempting to inquire more fully
into murat's terms):

there are things we CAN control as poets, esp. wrt our audiences...
not entirely of course, and not w/o the risk of failure (to wit:
"it's a tough room")... but probabilistically speaking, anyone who
performs enough can expect to hit (e.g.) an inquisitive nerve at a
certain point in any reading... one never knows for sure, of
course... still, those who would deny the latter outright will
probably end up giving awful readings/performances (depending, sure,
on what we mean by "awful")...

i also believe that discussions of the real, pace heidegger, must
distinguish between the real and something i'd call the given... but
i appreciate too your gloss on this, and am looking foward to murat's
response...

in all, i tend to believe that poets would do well in this regard,
for a change, to put away their heidegger and gadamer and all, and
attend more properly to the theatrical---which includes listening to
playwrights... conventional *and* unconventional playwrights know a
lot about how audiences react... theories of acting are pertinent
here too...

i trust i'm not being theoretically evasive... but if the poem, as
peter middleton has helpfully argued, is a "heteroclite entity," then
the poetry reading (and i would say, the prose reading, the fiction
reading, etc.) can be understood in some sense as an extension of
said poem-event... and that hyphen, i know, speaks volumes...

best,

joe

I am wondering about about online sites that list significant e-books. =

E-Books, though I only update that once a year. What do you all think =
about the idea of making that a standard part of websites. I am asking =
because there seems to be a problem e-book published writers of quality =
are having about credibility. Some say it's about printing the books =
out, which might be true but not a complete explanation of the e-book =
reality. I think it is credibility and weakness in the availability of =
online community space. These are the downloadable e-books that are paid =
for that I am referring to. It seems that as online magazines it is in =
our best interest and part of our mission to somehow lend credibility to =
this. Your thoughts?

=A0
Media and Falloojeh...
There has been a lot of criticism about the way Al-Arabia and Al-Jazeera
were covering the riots and fighting in Falloojeh and the south this last
week. Some American spokesman for the military was ranting about the "sprea=
d
of anti-Americanism" through networks like the abovementioned.
Actually, both networks did a phenomenal job of covering the attacks on
Falloojeh and the southern provinces. Al-Jazeera had their reporter
literally embedded in the middle of the chaos- and I don't mean the lame
embedded western journalists type of thing they had going at the beginning
of the war (you know- embedded in the Green Zone and embedded in Kuwait,
etc.). Ahmed Mansur, I believe his name was, was actually standing there, i=
n
the middle of the bombing, shouting to be heard over the F-16s and
helicopters blasting away at houses and buildings. It brought back the days
of 'shock and awe'...
I know it bothers the CPA terribly to have the corpses of dead Iraqis shown
on television. They would love for Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabia to follow
Al-Hurra's example and show endless interviews with pro-occupation Iraqis
living abroad and speaking in stilted Arabic. These interviews, of course,
are interspersed with translated documentaries on the many marvels of...
Hollywood. And while I, personally, am very interested in the custom leathe=
r
interiors of the latest Audi, I couldn't seem to draw myself away from
Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabia while 700+ Iraqis were being killed.
To lessen the feelings of anti-Americanism, might I make a few suggestions?
Stop the collective punishment. When Mark Kimmett stutters through a press
conference babbling about "precision weapons" and "military targets" in
Falloojeh, who is he kidding? Falloojeh is a small city made up of low,
simple houses, little shops and mosques. Is he implying that the 600
civilians who died during the bombing and the thousands injured and maimed
were all "insurgents"? Are houses, shops and mosques now military targets?
What I'm trying to say is that we don't need news networks to make us angry
or frustrated. All you need to do is talk to one of the Falloojeh refugees
making their way tentatively into Baghdad; look at the tear-stained faces,
the eyes glazed over with something like shock. In our neighborhood alone
there are at least 4 families from Falloojeh who have come to stay with
family and friends in Baghdad. The stories they tell are terrible and grim
and it's hard to believe that they've gone through so much.
I think western news networks are far too tame. They show the Hollywood
version of war- strong troops in uniform, hostile Iraqis being captured and
made to face "justice" and the White House turkey posing with the
Thanksgiving turkey... which is just fine. But what about the destruction
that comes with war and occupation? What about the death? I don't mean just
the images of dead Iraqis scattered all over, but dead Americans too. Peopl=
e
should *have* to see those images. Why is it not ok to show dead Iraqis and
American troops in Iraq, but it's fine to show the catastrophe of September
11 over and over again? I wish every person who emails me supporting the
war, safe behind their computer, secure in their narrow mind and fixed
views, could actually come and experience the war live. I wish they could
spend just 24 hours in Baghdad today and hear Mark Kimmett talk about the
death of 700 "insurgents" like it was a proud day for Americans
everywhere...=20
Still, when I hear talk about "anti-Americanism" it angers me. Why does
American identify itself with its military and government? Why is does bein=
g
anti-Bush and anti-occupation have to mean that a person is anti-American?
We watch American movies, listen to everything from Britney Spears to
Nirvana and refer to every single brown, fizzy drink as "Pepsi".
I hate American foreign policy and its constant meddling in the region... I
hate American tanks in Baghdad and American soldiers on our streets and in
our homes on occasion... why does that mean that I hate America and
Americans? Are tanks, troops and violence the only face of America? If the
Pentagon, Department of Defense and Condi are "America", then yes- I hate
America.=20

NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES/WOMEN'S STUDIES/CREATIVE NONFICTION

THE BEAR RIVER MASSACRE AND THE MAKING OF HISTORY
Kass Fleisher

Explores how a pivotal event in U.S. history -- the killing of nearly
300 Shoshoni men, women, and children in 1863 -- has been contested,
forgotten, and remembered.

At dawn on January 29, 1863, Union-affiliated troops under the
command of Col. Patrick Connor were brought by Mormon guides to the
banks of the Bear River, where, with the tacit approval of Abraham
Lincoln, they attacked and slaughtered nearly three hundred
Northwestern Shoshoni men, women, and children. Evidence suggests
that, in the hours after the attack, the troops raped the surviving
women -- an act still denied by some historians and Shoshoni elders.
In exploring why a seminal act of genocide is still virtually unknown
to the U.S. public, Kass Fleisher chronicles the massacre itself, and
investigates the National Park Service's proposal to create a
National Historic Site to commemorate the massacre -- but not the
rape. When she finds herself arguing with a Shoshoni woman elder
about whether the rape actually occurred, Fleisher is forced to
confront her own role as a maker of this conflicted history, and to
examine the legacy of white women "busybodies."

"In this remarkable book, Fleisher exposes and analyzes perhaps the
best concealed mass rape in the U.S. experience. Her probing analysis
forces us to consider how racism and sexism have converged to silence
victims, protect abusers of power, and advance the interests of
colonialism." - Maria Bevacqua, author of _Rape on the Public Agenda:
Feminism and the Politics of Sexual Assault_

"This is a troubling book in the way that any stirring-up troubles
surfaces, whether surface understandings, feelings, memories, or the
wounds that mark the white space of conventional history like
strangled words. These are stories you feel, which Fleisher has felt,
stirrings and troublings that flow from the wounds of the raped and
dead, over space and time, eventually becoming a dark blanket from
which, again and again, a dreamer awakens and walks forth. We are the
dreamer awakening, we are the massacred, ours are these stirring
stories." - Michael Joyce, author of _Moral Tales and Meditations:
Technological Parables and Refractions_

"The most intriguing dimension is the thrust, from a fascinating
variety of viewpoints, to achieve redemption-a great and signal
effort encompassing and, however awkwardly, transcending race and
ethnicity, religion and non-religion, tribal generations and tribal
factions and, very basically, the skeletal hand of History." - Hunter
Gray, activist and author (as John R. Salter Jr.) of _Jackson,
Mississippi_

Kass Fleisher is an Assistant Professor of English at Illinois State
University.

Further to what I posted, I am sorry, Alison, if my points seemed
simplistic. One can indulge in the rejoinder that simple questions need to
be asked, but my troubles are about the political import of some of the
canonical figures of the last century's Anglo-American literature, not their
private morals. The even wider question of morality and art is so fraught I
want to do a threatened ostrich on contemplating it, my retitle of this
thread is an index to that:

Thomas Griffiths Wainewright (1794-1847) is a kind of metonym for that
problem. He was a gifted artist, who never developed his gift to the full,
might have been a poet too, I'm not sure about that, and certainly was a
literary critic of great sensitivity - he was among the first to recognise
the genius of Blake.

He was also a fraud and probably a mass-murderer who poisoned members of his
family (including his wife) for insurance claims. The poisoning couldn't be
proved by the forensic science of the time but is quite likely. One
commentator said that he read poetry by day and poisoned by night. There is
literature on him by, among others, such an unlikely pairing as Oscar Wilde
and Andrew Motion. He ended his days in the Tasmanian penal colony.

Now where all this leads one I don't know - the reproductions of his
artistic work I've seen certainly indicate someone with a true ability. All
I've been muttering about though the implicit political import of some of
the Anglo-American canon, not their personal morals, which is such a
quagmire my feet get stuck in it immediately.

That was (to an extent) my point.  You originally seemed to be making
another one, which was rather more simplistic.

And which "people" are you referring to, here?  I seem to be reading quite a
lot of contemporary stuff which is very comfortable with explicit right wing
ideas.  Or are human beings with questionable political views not "people"?
Tempting to think so, perhaps, but I suspect they are.

I was going to reserve comment until I'd  finished reading--I'm about a
third of the way through the book, but Joe's announcement prompts me to say
that I started learning new things from the first sentence on. A deeply
moving, troubling, essential story. It's almost impossible not to
extrapolate to the rest of our history.

It's also a page-turner, and I've had to resist putting everything I'm
obliged to do aside and whiz thru. I can't recommend too highly.

I read "recompense" as "make up for."  It's more fantasmatic than its
companion, "compensation."  And more internalized than "make amends for;"
rather, it is a gift to oneself.  This is from Wordsworth, admittedly,
where he remarks about his natural religion being but "vain recompense,"
an empty self-payment.

So I guess I side with Murat, though I would add "and the reading of it."
The gift of poetry is both nothing and everything, absence and excess.

The quote from Silliman (admittedly of a rather dated variety) reminds me
of Fredric Jameson's claim about third world novels (these too are
dated) being more like the modernist (more Lawrence than Joyce) and
Victorian predecessors of postmodernism precisely because of the
capitalist formation they were written under.

I myself have thought that interesting dissertation would link the poetics
of cyberpunk, postcolonial literature, and language and ethnopoetics, the
claim being that they all orient around finding languages for futurity.
Modernist/Postmodernist arguments usually pivot around plot and
characterization, as well reflexivity, which I think many of us would
agree is much more implicit in language poetry than in, say, John Barth
(who himself hearkens back to the 18th origins of the novel, as does
Salman Rushdie).  and Jameson's claim says almost nothing about the
hegemony of the Cheever/Updike/Bellow school of luminous realism.

push my fat face into your inbox begging for attention &&
exhausted by turgid theory going nowhere $$
want to write on catherine daly mez and others poetics $$
tired of hatred & figure suicidal ##
burned out on bad news and no one wants to read this &&
another text with 'desire' and 'pleasure' sickens me $$
same with 'symbol' and 'sign' same with just about everything &&
only god talk allowed in this country &&
my fat face is suffocating with your detail ##
hold my hand and collaborate &&
i'll say this and you'll say that and my face will be killed &&
my face will be killed my face will be deleted $$
cold sores have broken out i have nightmares &&
not sleep and what will nn say but motherfucker to me and my kind &&
florian's gone away permanently and the unstable digest is dead &&
you think i'm just spam but i want to be one of the boys and girls $$
want to really matter but my fat face speaks garbage ##
beehive's off and dead i shit spam night and day &&
want to write on zen and mary shelley svengali in the injured wings ##
set up that fight of all knockout between mencius and longinus $$
bless the world cure the sick heal the wounded raise the dead $$
my fat face won't hold still it just yammers on and on and on &&
i'll give you anything i'll turn coat i'll turn traitor coward &&
i'll turn the one cheek i'll turn the other cheek $$
can't face the horror country burning down &&
fires everywhere my fat face can't breath ##
everywhere is everywhere &&
everywhere is everywhere &&

My Shelley Tomb


"For I have found myself sincerly concious, crost day and night, enclined
and embarrassing and prest; the seige on my heart in this desart brings an
ach to me, somthing hardly expected. Ah, exhiliarating life and its
violance! Yesterday, the atmospher was dark and threatning. I sought
assylum, invelloped by my loved one; this time there were no strange
occurences. I wept, I weep, I witnissed dayly medecines insuferably taken.
The docter dissappoints; I have no expectation in this hacnied time. My
headach grows worse with each quarell; scolars will judge. I await your
decision to befal me; from the labratory to the lodgeings, I am comming.

"How much longer with this disagreable life, improvisaing from the
precepieces. I releive in my immagination, the seige to my concious soul
which has staid too long in these appartments. Nothing has arrisen here or
abroard, nothing to bring an end to these phisical sufferings. Wait;
someone or somthing is aboutt; I will see, yes I an enclined to see.

"These negociations..."

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I'm pleased to announce that the 60 texts and paratexts of my two-year =
digital project, "The Silence of Sasquatch," are now in the stage I call =
an "advanced draft," admitting that completion of a work of art is never =
an option.
I realize that this is a large piece of work that takes a long time to =
read, but suggestions and/or corrections would be most welcome.
 I'm also looking for on-line journals that would be interested in =
publishing individual, or a selection of, texts, and festivals or =
conferences that would like to either link to the project, or play a CD =
of it.

Thanks so much.

i've noticed that every once in a while a post comes through looking =
like gibberish, as with joel lipman's post on spalding gray (which i =
really wanted to read----and which someone responded to, so some people =
must be able to read it).  it looks like this:

is this a problem other people have or just something with my computer?  =
what can be done about it?

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi,
this from another list i'm on.
kevin

From: Dru Oja Jay <dojy@mta.ca>

The past two weeks have seen a remarkable effort on the part of the US
government and numerous media outlets to directly contradict reality.
The single most remarkable instance of the contradiction came from US
military spokesman Mark Kimmitt, who said:

"The stations that are showing Americans intentionally killing women
and children are not legitimate news sources. That is propaganda, and
that is lies."

The astoundingly frank exhortation to shun plainly evident reality in
favour of official spin came amid US claims that 95% of the 600 killed
and thousands wounded during the military siege of Fallujah were
"fighters". An estimated 60,000 families were displaced.

The corporate media in Canada and the US, meanwhile, has made a
obfuscating and distracting from the siege of Fallujah and the
resulting human disaster. I know of no systematic study, but there has
been a distinct emphasis on "kidnapped" foreigners while war crimes,
massacres, murder, and the continuing illegality of the occupation
ignored or heavily marginalized.

In situations where disinformation reaches its absolute fever pitch, it
becomes crucial to focus on the reality of the situation, and to take
note of the gap between that reality and the manipulated images that
corporate media ask us to accept in its place.

Fallujah is one place, but understanding what went on there and
understanding the aforementioned gap can provide us with a healthy
skepticism and a set of questions that can be applied to almost all
other news coverage.

What follows is a series of excerpts from first hand accounts from
people in Fallujah and other independent analysis of the situation in
Iraq. Links to the original articles can be found here:

   http://dominionpaper.ca/weblog/2004/04/fallujah.html

Updates will be added to the same page. If you have comments,

"We were in Fallujah during the 'ceasefire.' This is what we saw and
heard. When the assault on Fallujah started, the power plant was
bombed. Electricity is provided by generators and usually reserved for
places with important functions. There are four hospitals currently
running in Fallujah. This includes the one where we were, which was
actually just a minor emergency clinic; another one of them is a car
repair garage."

 >>  Report from Fallujah -- Destroying a Town in Order to Save it, by
Rahul Mahajan

--

" As we neared Falluja, there were groups of children on the sides of
the road handing out water and bread to people coming into Falluja.
They began literally throwing stacks of flat bread into the bus. The
fellowship and community spirit was unbelievable. Everyone was yelling
for us, cheering us on, groups speckled along the road. As we neared
Falluja a huge mushroom caused by a large U.S. bomb rose from the city.
So much for the cease-fire."

 >> Americans Slaughtering Civilians in Falluja, by Dahr Jamail, The New
Standard

"We stop, turn off the siren, keep the blue light flashing, wait, eyes
on the silhouettes of men in US Marine uniforms on the corners of the
buildings. Several shots come. We duck, get as low as possible and I
can see tiny red lights whipping past the window, past my head. Some,
it's hard to tell, are hitting the ambulance. I start singing. What
else do you do when someone's shooting at you? A tire bursts with an
enormous noise and a jerk of the vehicle.

"I'm outraged. We're trying to get to a woman who's giving birth
without any medical attention, without electricity, in a city under
siege, in a clearly marked ambulance, and you're shooting at us. How
dare you?"

 >> "Easter in Fallujah," by Jo Wilding

--

"There is not much dispute about the death toll at Falluja, which
remains a no-go zone for foreign reporters. But while townspeople say
they were mostly children, women and old men, US spokesmen insist that
95 per cent of the dead were fighters who had met the precision
shooting of the US marines."

 >> Flight from a town where sports fields are graveyards, Paul
McGeough, Sydney Morning Herald

--

"The hostage situations are a mess. I watch television and it feels
like I'm watching another country. All I can think is, "We've become
one of *those* countries..." You know- the ones where hostages are
taken on a daily basis and governments warn their civilians of visiting
or entering the country. It's especially sad because even during those
long years during the blockade and in between wars and bombings, there
were never any attacks on foreigners. Iraqis are hospitable, friendly
people who always used to treat foreigners with care... now, everyone
is treated like a potential enemy."

 >> "Baghdad Burning" Weblog

--

"More than 60,000 women and children fled the city during a brief
ceasefire on Friday but the US blocked any men of military age from
leaving. Dozens of bodies have been buried in the city's soccer stadium
after US forces blocked roads heading toward the cemetery."

 >> Democracy Now interviews Aaron Glantz

--

"But when asked about the victims, US marine Lieutenant Colonel Brennan
Byrne said: 'What I think you will find is 95% of those were
military-age males that were killed in the fighting. The marines are
trained to be precise in their firepower ... The fact that there are
600 goes back to the fact that the marines are very good at what they
do.'"

 >> Mail and Guardian (South Africa)

--

"The insurrection in Shia areas of Iraq was not a sudden explosion, nor
was it primarily inspired by the events in Falluja. It was, instead,
the result of a long series of actions and reactions between the
Coalition's armed forces and increasingly organized and anti-American
Shia militias."

 >> What Triggered the Shia Insurrection?, by Michael Schwartz

--

"
'We are going to Fallujah.'

'To Fallujah? For jihad?'

'No, we are going to help people there.'

'Do you need weapons? Do you need someone to show you the way in?'"

 >> Fallujah Stories, by Wendell Steavenson

--

"We were taken to the families in the shelter by Dr Abed al-Illah, a
specialist in internal medicine who is also a representative of the
Iraqi Islamic Party, which is part of the US-appointed Iraqi Governing
Council. He had just visited Fallujah hospital. He said: 'About 350 out
of the 600 dead were women and children. One was only eight months old.
Many died from simple wounds and could have been saved if they had
medical attention.'"

One can only assume, I would guess -  at least from a smart marketing point
of view - that the publisher and editors are planning a second volume that
will include the 500 - 1000 - 2000 and 3000 word essays. Does anyone know?

And is aware of comparable volumes in other disciplines, say, political
science, where, for example, Senator Charles Shummer (sp?) would get 5000
words, where Senator Hilary Clinton would get 8,000 words??

Where is Rabelais when we need him most? A canon is not too far from a bell.

Has anyone who moves in the late 18th or early 19th C.
encountered the phrase

"My Eyes have pow'r to kill or cure"

A friend has just come across a piece of vernac. art
from that era, with that phrase as caption.

Any assistance most appreciated.

Thanks -Mike

Mike,

Checking the Chadwyck-Healey English Poetry Full-Text
Database (165,000 poems by 1,250 poets, from 600 A.D.
to the 1900s) for a Proximity Search on the words
"eyes," "cure" and "kill," they occur within 120
characters (but not within 80 characters) in three
cases that are basically the same as yours:

(The examples quoted below are a trail that starts out
"hot," then gets progressively thinner and thinner.  I
include them all only for the sake of thoroughness.)


In the poem "Lilla" by Cornelius Webb (~Lyric Leaves,~
1832), there are the lines:

   Her eyes all eyes on earth surpass,
   They kill and cure you too!

(They occur once more in roughly the same period, in
John Payne's poem "Schopenhauer" [~Vigil and vision.
New Sonnets,~ 1903], but in a different context:
leaches.)

The Proximity Search otherwise finds those words only
a century earlier, twice (to which the later "Lilla"
could perhaps be traced):

less pertinently, John Oldmixon's  "Epistle VII: Mr.
Waller to the Countess of Carlisle" (~Amores
Britannici. Epistles Historical and Gallant,~ 1703)
has

   The killing Smart, contented, he'd endure,
   Were your Eyes ready as to hurt, to cure

but, perhaps more significantly, Samuel
Cobb's/Nicholas Rowe's 1712 ~Callipædia. A Poem. In
Four Books. With Some Other Pieces. Written in Latin
By Claudius Quillet, Made English By N. Rowe~ has

   Deform'd, she cures the Wound her Beauty gave,
   And She, whose Eyes could kill me, now can save.

Perhaps the ur-source of the trope is in the Latin of
Claudius Quillet.

-------------------------------------------------------

The next most relevant citations are perhaps ones that
~reverse~ the word order into "cure or kill," but
relevant because they share the same mantic, female
menace of "Lilla" and "Callipædia" (although preceding
them):

Ralph Knevet (1600 - 1671) in a 1966 Ohio State
University Press redaction of his verse play, "Rhodon
And Iris", has the character Martagnon saying

  The panting heart of the dull melancholy Owle,
  Or the breathing entrailes cut from a living Cat.
  The proudest Swaine that lives in Thessaly.
  Is glad to be obsequious to her will,
  For in her power it is to cure or kill

and Robert Dixon's 1683 "Canidia, or The Witches": "As
true as ever struck stroak, / Either to cure or kill
good Folk".

(John Clare's "The Surprise" has "throb'd & heav'd /
With charms to cure or kill".)

-------------------------------------------------------

Bifurcated into unmatched parts, the phrases "to kill
or cure," "eyes have power" or "power to kill,"
searched separately, occur often enough, but in a way
that merely shows that those dictions were
free-floating throughout the language and poetry in a
recombinant way that could easily semantically produce
your quote, but without re-constituting it verbatim.

"to kill or cure":

Robert Browning's 1872 "Red Cotton Night-Cap Country,
Or Turf And Towers": "An accident which comes ~to kill
or cure,~ / A jerk which mends a dislocated joint!";
--- Joseph Munby's 1891 ~Vestigia Retrorsum~ (a
political one you might enjoy): "we saw men striving
~to kill or cure~ -- / By making or mending of rules
and laws / Amid hostile yells or fond applause"

"eyes have power":

Sir Charles Sedley (1639 - 1701), "TO CLARISSA Upon
dirtying her Lodgings" (sic), in a 1928 re-printing:
"Dust from my earthy Surface fell, / And soil'd the
fair Clarissa's Cell; / Clarissa's Eyes have Pow'r
Divine"; --- "Love's Insight" in Palgrave's 1891-1897
~Golden Treasury~;  --- George Lyttleton (1777), "Writ
at Mr. Pope's House at Twickenham, which he had lent
to MRS. G*****LLE": "G___lle, whose eyes have power to
make / A Pope of every swain"

"power to kill"

in 52 poets, including Byron's "Prisoner Of Chillon",
Coleridge, Cowper, Dryden, Herrick, Quarles, Raleigh,
Rosetti, and Tennyson.

For those of you have sent me links to your e-book titles, thank you. I =
am excited about the response. Please send out the word if you are =
posting other places that I welcome more links. Interested authors or =
publishers should send me Name of Author, Name of Book and Link.=20

Also, I have heard from Mary Sands at Jack Magazine and she will also be =
creating a link section titled E-Books.
You can send to her in the same format as you send to Big Bridge.=20

Finally, if you are an editor of an online magazine I hope you will also =
add a link section titled E-Books and consider this an essential part of =
strenthening an internet based literary community, and a way of getting =
your work out.

Finally, finally, I encourage writers to review e-books just like any =
other book!!!

Best, Michael

In the newspaper this morning, there's an interview with the actor and =
Kung Fu student, David Carradine. He says, "After you become a certain =
level of (Kung Fu) master, you should start learning a healing art. One =
of the things that my...trainer for the last 20 years says is, 'It's =
very difficult to heal with the fist.' It's simple, right? If you want =
to make the world a better place, beatin' up people is probably not the =

Gary,

I am overwhelmed by the abundance of your responses, particularly, since you=
=20
seem to be answering the questions you are asking yourself.

I will try to tackle a few of your points by asking a few questions:

"1.=A0 Your ideal perspective of a poet and his or her work purposefully
slights the world in which a poet writes.=A0 You aren't the only one to
purchase such idealism; thankfully, the rebuttals are vast and more
substantial.=A0 Off the top of my head, Mary Robinson's "The Poet's
Garret" (1806)."

Where did I exactly slight the world in which a poet writes? What is exactly=
=20
the idealism you are referring to? As for purchasing, what does exactly=20
purchasing idealism mean?

2. "If we agree that recompense, a verb, is to 'make
amends,' and that its context assumes a purposeful address to a loss.
Recompense is a payment in return for something."

How did you exactly get "making amends" from "recompense," at least from the=
=20
way I used the word, "since poetry in monetary terms has almost no social=20
recompense?"

I am not talking about guilt or sin, rather, if poetry has any value as=20
labor. My point is that, economically, poetry is not "productive" labor, but=
 a=20
"consumption." A poet is an anti-productive consumer of time, similar to an=20
addict. Addicted to words, a poet uses words uselessly, beyond their product=
ive=20
function. To me, this is the defining quality of a post-modern, post-avant=20
(whatever one calls it) poem. This anti-productive bias permeates the poem.=20=
A lot=20
flows from it. I discuss this point in the essay, "Is Poetry a Job, Is a Poe=
m a=20
Product?," published in Gary Sullivan's journal Read Me and can be reached=20
through google.

3. " Even if I feel I can write from an ideal place of pure invention, my=20
poem
still would be a result of beholding or viewing something in the world."

I never claimed poetry has no relation to the world, only that its relation=20
is quite different from what it is usually assumed to be.=20

Here is another similarity, as I see it, between a coke hit and writing a=20
poem: in both, the value lies in the hit. When it is over, the only thing on=
e can=20
do is to repeat the process. The memory of a high does not create a high.  =20

4."A poem is a response to being in the world."

I assume this means one must be born to write a poem. How true.

5. "The poem itself cannot exist without a potentiality for a poet's being
in the world.=A0 The actual audience for any given poem does not exist.
The poem as an object out there to be read represents a specific
potentiality for its being ready-at-hand.=A0 When a poem is made
ready-at-hand, then a readership is intended and necessary."

I do not see anything necessary. To paraphrase King Lear, "I may call them,=20
but will they hear?"

I am talking about the gap between the intentions of a poet and the response=
=20
-which most of the time is silence- which he or she receives; am talking abo=
ut=20
writing against this silence. Ask a poet like Alan Sondheim, for instance,=20
about its excruciating reality. What keeps him going? He may feel that a ser=
ies=20
of web sites are his community. But how much of this community "receives"=20
everything he puts out?=20

6. "I suppose you could claim to have knowledge of the first poem written
and knowledge of what that author had in mind and, then, make the claim
that what was in mind had nothing to do with potential readers but with
an entire OTHER phenomena that we have muddied up and called poetry..."

No, I have no claims of knowledge on what the other poet had in mind. I read=
=20
a poem -or any other work for that matter- if it appeals to me, aware that t=
he=20
appeal has to do with my own needs. What is more, my reading of writers who=20
are really important to me, for instance, Walter Benjamin, Swift, Shakespear=
e=20
in his sonnets, Melville, a number of Turkish poets in 20th century, to name=
 a=20
few, always involves a misreading of their works. That misreading is an=20
acknowledgment of their difference, a point I discussed in detail around=20
translation.

7. "Finally, I find your claim that a lot' of the culture surrounding a
poem is 'non-linguistic' suspect."

Suspect, but true. Suppose Bush, for example, without his strutting walk. Do=
=20
you think he could win any elections then?

8. "Your comment speaks more about your disposition towards a potential=20
audience outside of an ideal community"  =20

The poet lives in the community, not an ideal community. That is the point o=
f=20
my whole argument. I am talking about poetry in the community, not an ideal=20
community. "Writing in silence" deals with the clash between the poet's idea=
l=20
community (basically, in the poet's mind energizing him or her) and the=20
community into which his or her poem will fall. In my view, if a poet is con=
scious of=20
and needs to write about the wider community, he or she must integrate that=20
clash/gap -as a clash- into the work.

9. "And poor poet that has to live with that flaw! Poor poet?"

You are responding to your own rhetorical flourish; the word flaw has no=20
connotation of "poor poet" for me.

10. "a writer cannot expect a good reading from something not yet written.
This is what revision is about"

Your assumption that a poet's revisions make a poem readable is not=20
necessarily so. In the case of some poets, the revisions make the poem incre=
asingly=20
"unreadable." Just one example: the very first draft of "Finnegan's Wake" an=
d the=20
final work.

    Greenboathouse Books is pleased to announce the launch of our annual =
    website overhaul.  A bit late, of course, yet just in time for Poetry =
    Month, our 2004 redesign took a little longer than expected, but =
    hopefully the delay paid off.

    With this update we're pleased to present new work by a variety of =
    writers on a variety of pages, and, as with previous version launches, =
    we have a little promotional thing happening as well.

    With new acquisitions in the Archive, a new round of our ongoing Variant =
    project,  downloadable PDFs of all previous Variant broadsheets, and new =
    bibliographic listings for our entire chapbook catalogue, there's plenty =
    of great stuff to explore, and plenty more to come.

    So, head to the site and have a look around, then send us a note and let =
    us know what you think. Your comments & suggestions are always =
    appreciated...

Subject:      Re: about social recompense
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain

Murat:
I am overwhelmed by the abundance of your responses, particularly,
since you seem to be answering the questions you are asking yourself.

Am I supposed to be offended by the implication that I could care less
what you were trying to say or enthused that you find my response so
hilariously involved?

Murat:
>Where did I exactly slight the world in which a poet writes?

I referred to Mary Robinson's The Garret, a poem in which she describes
the poet's room as a shelter from the world he writes about.  It is a
poem that criticizes a specific poetic response to the world...namely,
that the poet merely writes and can do so away from or secluded from or
with contempt for "the world"--the world, as in the market, the
community, culture.

I think it is a slight to claim no social recompense.

Murat:
>What is exactly  the idealism you are referring to?

Your initial claim is necessarily idealistic because one cannot live
never mind write outside of society; any claim to write for writing's
sake or write for *my own* sake, therefore, is idealistic.  I modify
the idealism with "purchase" because only certain authors have access
to solitude and seclusion.  Also, most idealisms are purchased.

Murat:
>How did you exactly get "making amends" from "recompense," at least
from the way I used the word, "since poetry in monetary terms has
almost no social recompense?"


The word, recompense, means to make amends for or to make up for.  It
is really that simple.  And as a check, I referred to the OED just to
make sure I hadn't overlooked a specific etymological eccentricity.  I
haven't.  As a listmember pointed out: we may disagree about the
quality of "making amends" or "making up"...contrasting the sense of
amends and up.

I took you for your word:  no social recompense means no social
compensation.  You refer to social recompense as a monetary issue.
Social recompense is not limited to economics in the way you put
it...that is what I criticized.

Murat:
>I am not talking about guilt or sin, rather, if poetry has any value as
labor. My point is that, economically, poetry is not "productive" labor

And I disagree with you.  First, I disagree with your use of economic
theory--the theory of labor and use value as contrasted with abstract
labor and Value.  You seem to equate money with use in a way that use
and money do not either relate to one another or exchange with one
another.  Second, I disagree that profitablility is a useful measure
for the productivity or usefulness of the labor in poetry.  You provide
an "if and only if" limit on examining usefulness of labor in poetry;
if and only if poetry is paid for is it productive labor.

Again, I disagree.

Murat:
>A poet is an anti-productive consumer of time, similar to an
>addict. Addicted to words, a poet uses words uselessly, beyond their
productive function.

This qualification certainly does not apply to many American poets,
past and present.  Poetry consumes time: ok.  Poetry is an
"anti-prodcutive consumer of time."  I just don't get this.  If poetry
consumes time and reading it is time consuming--that is productive if
only because time is measurable.

And I don't buy the claim that a poet is word-addicted.  I think many
poets shun words and wordiness.


Murat:
>To me, this is the defining quality of a post-modern, post-avant
>(whatever one calls it) poem. This anti-productive bias permeates the
poem.

Still, for some exemplary poets your claim may hold true.  But, your
claim, doesn't sufficiently define any period.  And your "to me"
quality of limiting a discussion to your claim and market view
proscribes quite a bit of possible reasonable claims about the absolute
reliance on social recompense that poetry actaully participates with.

As I mentioned: if we resist relating labor to cash money, then social
recompense can be something linguistic and productive in exchange in
culture with or without payment--the labor is productive because it is
conducted within culture.

But then you and I seem to have very different definitions of VOCATION.

Murat:
>Here is another similarity, as I see it, between a coke hit and writing
a poem: in both, the value lies in the hit.

No.  I disagree.  A coke hit and writing a poem are different
experiences.  And such analogies do nothing positively to address the
experience of writing a poem.

Snorting lines & writing lines are not analogical.

And your analogy breaks down on all sorts of levels when you begin to
apply your market notions about poetry.

Never mind that neurologically language and cocaine work on the body
differently.


Murat:
>I assume this means one must be born to write a poem. How true.

Well, according to your description, I must take a hit of cocaine in
order to get your drift.  So whose more absurd?  My point is in
reference to a certain recognition that every individual shares and was
in keeping with my point about social recompense.  You knew this,
though.

Murat:
>I do not see anything necessary. To paraphrase King Lear, "I may call
them, but will they hear?"

And Lear was a fool who choked to death on his own words and
misrecognition.  His own cock in his mouth and, I suppose, I powdered
nose, too.


>I am talking about the gap between the intentions of a poet and the
response-which most of the time is silence- which he or she receives;
am talking about writing against this silence.

Fine, but this is merely one way of using an ideal reader and is in
spite of its aggressive nature, still a form of social recompense.


Murat:
>What keeps him going? He may feel that a series of web sites are his
community. But how much of this community "receives"
>everything he puts out?

I am not speaking for anybody; but I would say that it really doesn't
matter whether anybody receives anything from A.  Just doing the work
assumes much more of a social relationship than can ever be actually
realized.




>I read a poem -or any other work for that matter- if it appeals to me,
aware that the appeal has to do with my own needs. What is more, my
reading of writers who are really important to me, for instance, Walter
Benjamin,

Not to cut you off in mid sentence; but you are most certainly aware of
how the majority of your claims are in conflict with Benjamin and other
cultural theorists.  Your "negotiations" of your relationships to
cultural texts, those texts production, and your intentions in creating
or reading, in this case, participate in much more than your intentions
intend...

Your claim about appeal and your own needs illustrates a dependence
upon a solipsism that may exist in the ethos of a coke addict's
everyday existence but does not address the kind of dialogue that takes
place when a poet participates in the form of poetry.

I am not arguing that poetry must have a form.  Rather, that poetry is
always in response to prior versification in some way, even in its
ignorance of further form.

Murat:
>Suppose Bush, for example, without his strutting walk. Do
>you think he could win any elections then?

Bush won an election?

But seriously:  Bush won an election because of his strut?

Boy howdy you are overlooking the charisma that powerful white men have
for the bourgeois in United States political economy.

Take for instance, that the jury couldn't convict white collar
criminals in a few cases now: TYCO and Qwest execs.  It isn't a strut,
man, it is our illusion-ridden culture that purchases notions of
individuality that do not exist other than ideologically.

Once again--no such thing as the solitary poet.  no such thing as the
rugged individual.  on the other hand: such a thing as a messy
confusing congealing mass of culture that is purposefully, though often
unconsciously (like a lot of poetry) produced.


Murat:
>The poet lives in the community, not an ideal community.

Well, on this point we absolutely agree.  Though, your definitions for
doing poetry are IDEAL and ideological.  To use Althusser:  ideological
in the sense that they misrepresent the real conditions of existence.


Murat:
>"Writing in silence" deals with the clash between the poet's ideal
community (basically, in the poet's mind energizing him or her) and the
community into which his or her poem will fall. In my view, if a poet
is conscious of and needs to write about the wider community, he or she
must integrate that clash/gap -as a clash- into the work.


Well, I am pooped--too much teaching and I am sick.  I have responded
enough to probably annoy you and make my point.  The latter is not my
intention, the former a fond hope.

All you use of "writing in silence" is neat, I think.  though, I think
often cliche.  Not your use; but it is a common statement.

"Do you hear that screaming all about you, that screaming men call
silence?"  I forget who wrote this.  Herzog uses it in the beginning of
_Enigma of Kaspar Hauser_.  Silence is not quiet and does represent a
potential clash.

anyway, I am finding more agreement between us as your response
progressed.  It seems we disagree still in respect to labor and
recompense.

So be it,

this is a listserv after all, and I will enter the classroom and my
next reading or my basement study without once considering how I
maintain a conscious proximal relationship to an audience and the
market.  IT is always there.  And that isn't a rhetorical flourish.

tchau,
Gary Norris

ps:thanks for responding.  i really do appreciate the time you took in
answering.

Subject:      Re: about social recompense (and stuff)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

My interest in the exchange between Murat Nemet-Nejat
and Gary Patrick Norris re: social recompense took me
to Murat Nemet-Nejat’s essay “Is Poetry a Job,
Is a Poem a Product.”

(HERE: http://home.jps.net/~nada/murat1.htm)


I have some questions for Murat (can I refer to you as
such?) or anyone else who’s been following this
debate. I’m interested in the consequences of Murat’s
argument for poetics and aesthetic theory, and I’ll
try to keep a check on the disjunction of thought as I
piece things together here (no promises).

I had thought one of the benefits, if I may use such a
word, of reading “Finnegan’s Wake” – doing the work? -
was precisely the way in which it might alter one’s
sense of time, perhaps opening a space where the
pervasive ‘time **is** money’ conflation so
indispensable to a capital driven reality-principle’
is no longer so generative or value-defining. Is
Murat’s argument against this view? (I wish I had a
copy of Giorgio Agamben’s “Stanzas; Word and Phantasm
in Western Culture” at hand. Agemben’s discussion,
from what I can remember of it, has much to offer this
debate).

Perhaps a kind of vulgar understanding of readability
closely aligns it with a readiness of/for consumption,
but for myself, and I’m guessing for many on this
list, ‘writerly’ or ‘difficult’ texts are far more
readable than the latest Clancy novel or whichever
‘readable’ text supplies the (anti-)/canon fodder -
Billy Collins seems to be a reliable whipping boy from
what I gather. For myself, unless I’m endeavoring to
do some cultural critical work, reading many or most
bestselling poetry volumes or novels would be dull,
grunt labour -- just as a Backstreet Boys single may
be less ‘listenable’ than a Steve Reich composition.
All these binaries (writerly/readerly,
producer/consumer) always sit above a big ol’ leaning
tower of ‘for who?’’s and ‘in what circumstances?” I
guess.

Murat:
“The American poet has a unique relation to language
in the culture. He or she fetishizes language in
excess of its use as a means of exchange, beyond what
the culture wants of it; he or she sexualizes it into
uselessness. This economically — capitalistically —
perverse relation gives the poem its consumptive
aura.”

In a broader culture which operates according to a
logic which would flatten all meaning(s) into one or
an infinite many consumable pancake(s) (and I see no
appreciable difference between the one and the
unlimited many here, the effective eradication of
heterogeneity and possibility is the same), the
assignment or diagnosis(?) of  a language-fetish or
word-addiction to poets and poetic process as a
reversal of the producer/consumer binary makes fairly
good sense to me, or, at least as far as its abstract
structural logic follows, it has a certain
counterintuitive appeal (keeping in mind Nietzsche and
Adorno’s dictums that that which is pleasurable or
appealing is often proof of nothing more than that--an
appeal with no necessary baring on truth as such).

In this sort of paradigm then, isn’t a sort of onus of
production put on the reader, listener, critic to
**make** some sense of the poems? Isn’t this sort of
the bottom line of Barthes’ theorization of the
‘writerly’ text? Doesn’t the difficult poem or text,
riding tho it does on its relative cultural and
institutional (academic) privilege, at least in theory
(ugh) democratize meaning and open discursive space to
hitherto unknown possibilities? Isn’t this, if it
occurs, productive and hasn’t the poet done something
Good, maybe even in the high philosophical sense?

Or, to wax Bourdieuian, do poems insofar as they may
bring cultural and symbolic capital back to their
progenitors and even grant the poet a place in a
community or support network of peers (no small thing
in-itself!), offer a shit-tone of compensation? I
mean, I’ve never tried to get any of my own poems
published but the fact that I do this thing called
‘writing poetry’ does bring me to this list, and put
me in contact with people (and texts) I respect and
benefit from knowing of. . . .

Murat:
“The poem is its writing — the poet writes to feel
good, to experience the sense of discovery and power
by converting a mental sound into physical sound. The
moment that occurs the poem dies for the poet — as a
climax dies — then to the next one. What happens to
the poem afterwards is, essentially, meaningless.”


Unless I’ve missed something (I feel I have), Murat’s
argument suggests the poem is a kind of afterbirth or
spent load – a “phantom product” – which the
reader/critic recuperates into the productive cycle,
making a productive commodity-object of the poet’s
properly useless expenditure (following Bataille’s
use), in effect de-fetishizing it (?) in the same way
that a psychoanalytic diagnosis reintegrates or
organizes neuroses to the reality-principle (here
noting the glaring counterpoint of  a hermeneutic or
interpretive process -- a dialogic realm to which
theory and poetics presumably have something to offer
-- which is opposed to a **vulgarized** or rigidly
hierarchical Freudian praxis which would quiet any
dialectic between personal and social/cultural
transformation).

I don’t know, hermeneutics – good or bad? Yes/no.
Write/wrong. Sing/Song. Ping-Pong.

Murat’s argument reminds me of Buadrillard’s much
anthologized theory of the way which **supposedly**
non-sensical or non-signifying instances of “savage
graffiti” (Baudy’s primitivism, not mine) operate as a
ludic derailment of the signifying chain: the
liberating potential of  pure noise, the burning of
signs . . . etc,
hack-pittooyhypernihilismthelecturecircuit.

But doesn’t theory, and to a similar extent poetics,
only continue because of some tacit investment in
COLLECTIVE attempts at making meaning? Can someone
explain to me how, following Murat’s argument,
poetics discussions and theorizing aren’t merely
manifestations of a parasitical bad-faith which feeds
on the stillborn  legacy of isolated poetic and
discursive acts? ( ‘stillborn’ is a significant
re-phrasing of Murat’s “phantom product”, but I think
its apt in characterizing Murat’s stated views, or
what I can make of them, and I mean no disrespect;
further, IF this characterization is apt, why not
replace the stillborn analogy with the continuous
birth? A continuous present?)

Or is it that following a logic of reversed values,
this parasitic practice (poetics discussions, theory,
aesthetics) is the newly endowed locus of value?

But . . . oh, hey, maybe I just figured out what I’ve
been missing. The PRIMARY reason a poet writes is not
to get anything in return, socially speaking. I accept
this and it seems true to me. But, some strange things
seem to follow from Murat’s argument/essay along the
way to making a relatively simple point.

Or, have I indeed missed something crucial?


 (And please be gentle, the ad hominem and ad hoc mode
of response that occurs on this list and which I too
have been guilty of can be fun to watch and
participate in, but I feel like just stepping into the
fray of debate here means punching above my weight –
and I do appreciate the opportunity to do so!)

Gary, Murat,
Keep this dialog alive...you two have brought more intense discussion =
related to the activity of writing poetry to this site than I have seen =
in the past 18 months.  Frankly, I was getting bored until this thread =
started. =20

And I can't help but wonder if the two of you, so apparently apart in =
your views, see the  similarities in your arguments (although, Gary, I =
do side with Murat on a point that it does appear you take liberties =
with his choice of words; you need to be a bit more careful in your =
paraphrasing). =20

Also, it appears to this reader that you have been bound up in the world =
of the writer in your comments and have overlooked the role of the =
reader as critical player in the poetic paradigm.   =20

Is it true that the poet owns the poem, or has the reader a role to play =
in the socio-context of the work?  And if so, what is that role?  How =
has the concept of having an audience affected the writer's creativity?  =
Are some writer's avoiding certain words or phrases because they have an =
aversion to upsetting a segment in the readership?  Worse, are some =
works written merely to appeal to a specific segment of the readership =
world?  Can the writer control his/her avoidance/embracing of a segment  =
of the readership?=20

More, if the reader is involved, to what extent does the reader's =
involvement influence the end result of the creator/poet?  More, has any =
of this had a fundamental origin in the socio-climate/background of the =
poet as it is related from the reader's frame of origins? In simple =
terms, do the Welsh have a predisposition to verse from Welsh writers?  =
etc. etc. etc. =20

I look forward to your continued dialog.=20

  Subject: Re: about social recompense


  Gary,

  I am overwhelmed by the abundance of your responses, particularly, =
since you=20
  seem to be answering the questions you are asking yourself.

  I will try to tackle a few of your points by asking a few questions:

  "1. Your ideal perspective of a poet and his or her work purposefully
  slights the world in which a poet writes. You aren't the only one to
  purchase such idealism; thankfully, the rebuttals are vast and more
  substantial. Off the top of my head, Mary Robinson's "The Poet's
  Garret" (1806)."

  Where did I exactly slight the world in which a poet writes? What is =
exactly=20
  the idealism you are referring to? As for purchasing, what does =
exactly=20
  purchasing idealism mean?

  2. "If we agree that recompense, a verb, is to 'make
  amends,' and that its context assumes a purposeful address to a loss.
  Recompense is a payment in return for something."

  How did you exactly get "making amends" from "recompense," at least =
from the=20
  way I used the word, "since poetry in monetary terms has almost no =
social=20
  recompense?"

  I am not talking about guilt or sin, rather, if poetry has any value =
as=20
  labor. My point is that, economically, poetry is not "productive" =
labor, but a=20
  "consumption." A poet is an anti-productive consumer of time, similar =
to an=20
  addict. Addicted to words, a poet uses words uselessly, beyond their =
productive=20
  function. To me, this is the defining quality of a post-modern, =
post-avant=20
  (whatever one calls it) poem. This anti-productive bias permeates the =
poem. A lot=20
  flows from it. I discuss this point in the essay, "Is Poetry a Job, Is =
a Poem a=20
  Product?," published in Gary Sullivan's journal Read Me and can be =
reached=20
  through google.

  3. " Even if I feel I can write from an ideal place of pure invention, =
my=20
  poem
  still would be a result of beholding or viewing something in the =
world."

  I never claimed poetry has no relation to the world, only that its =
relation=20
  is quite different from what it is usually assumed to be.=20

  Here is another similarity, as I see it, between a coke hit and =
writing a=20
  poem: in both, the value lies in the hit. When it is over, the only =
thing one can=20
  do is to repeat the process. The memory of a high does not create a =
high.  =20

  4."A poem is a response to being in the world."

  I assume this means one must be born to write a poem. How true.

  5. "The poem itself cannot exist without a potentiality for a poet's =
being
  in the world. The actual audience for any given poem does not exist.
  The poem as an object out there to be read represents a specific
  potentiality for its being ready-at-hand. When a poem is made
  ready-at-hand, then a readership is intended and necessary."

  I do not see anything necessary. To paraphrase King Lear, "I may call =
them,=20
  but will they hear?"

  I am talking about the gap between the intentions of a poet and the =
response=20
  -which most of the time is silence- which he or she receives; am =
talking about=20
  writing against this silence. Ask a poet like Alan Sondheim, for =
instance,=20
  about its excruciating reality. What keeps him going? He may feel that =
a series=20
  of web sites are his community. But how much of this community =
"receives"=20
  everything he puts out?=20

  6. "I suppose you could claim to have knowledge of the first poem =
written
  and knowledge of what that author had in mind and, then, make the =
claim
  that what was in mind had nothing to do with potential readers but =
with
  an entire OTHER phenomena that we have muddied up and called =
poetry..."

  No, I have no claims of knowledge on what the other poet had in mind. =
I read=20
  a poem -or any other work for that matter- if it appeals to me, aware =
that the=20
  appeal has to do with my own needs. What is more, my reading of =
writers who=20
  are really important to me, for instance, Walter Benjamin, Swift, =
Shakespeare=20
  in his sonnets, Melville, a number of Turkish poets in 20th century, =
to name a=20
  few, always involves a misreading of their works. That misreading is =
an=20
  acknowledgment of their difference, a point I discussed in detail =
around=20
  translation.

  7. "Finally, I find your claim that a lot' of the culture surrounding =
a
  poem is 'non-linguistic' suspect."

  Suspect, but true. Suppose Bush, for example, without his strutting =
walk. Do=20
  you think he could win any elections then?

  8. "Your comment speaks more about your disposition towards a =
potential=20
  audience outside of an ideal community"  =20

  The poet lives in the community, not an ideal community. That is the =
point of=20
  my whole argument. I am talking about poetry in the community, not an =
ideal=20
  community. "Writing in silence" deals with the clash between the =
poet's ideal=20
  community (basically, in the poet's mind energizing him or her) and =
the=20
  community into which his or her poem will fall. In my view, if a poet =
is conscious of=20
  and needs to write about the wider community, he or she must integrate =
that=20
  clash/gap -as a clash- into the work.

  9. "And poor poet that has to live with that flaw! Poor poet?"

  You are responding to your own rhetorical flourish; the word flaw has =
no=20
  connotation of "poor poet" for me.

  10. "a writer cannot expect a good reading from something not yet =
written.
  This is what revision is about"

  Your assumption that a poet's revisions make a poem readable is not=20
  necessarily so. In the case of some poets, the revisions make the poem =
increasingly=20
  "unreadable." Just one example: the very first draft of "Finnegan's =
Wake" and the=20
  final work.

  Ciao,

  Murat=20

Hello everyone

Does anyone have an up-to-date email address for Jackson Mac Low
please? I have sent him an email but haven't received a reply, so I
think my address for him may be out-of-date.

Many thanks

(My forwarding of this original message didn't go through, sorry, Charlotte)
Original message from Jeanne Marie Beaumont:

Would any one like to be part of a panel in Vancouver (well, probably a
round-table officially), on teaching poetry classes/workshops for adults outside of
academia, ie, in Y's, community centers, etc.? It seems to me the needs of
this particular group and the challenges, as well as the rewards of this type of
teaching, differ substantially from teaching students in undergrad and
graduate programs, and I don't think this has been addressed much (I am about to
peruse the AWP books from the past 3 conferences to confirm this). If interested,
please back-channel with your ideas, experiences, and thoughts.

Thank you

Announcing a new book by Tom Beckett,
acclaimed poet & editor of _The Difficulties_ magazine (1980-1990):

VANISHING POINTS OF RESEMBLANCE

This is truly a milestone text for Mr. Beckett.

Here we have a hybrid work, an autobiotextography, where the text qua Subject
qua authorial voice-over invokes selected events of a (his?) life (which is
also the life of the (creation of the) text) with a concise clarity and a fully
self-conscious honesty.  In VANISHING POINTS OF RESEMBLANCE, this common
theme is given the masterfully interwoven Beckettian treatment.

Imagine Mondrian adjusting the lines of his paintings by a millimeter at a
time:  that is a reasonable analogue for Mr. Beckett's approach to the creation
of his texts.

Not to be missed.

21 pages, perfect-bound paperback
$7.00 US

Well, about most of that I agree with you. But I still say what has
changed, re the USAmerican invasion of the world. I mean, people
outside the US were amazed and bemused after 11/9 to read of
USAmericans asking in their innocence, "Why do they hate us?"

I hope I pointed this out clearly in my second response to Murat.  I do=20=

see similarities...more than disparities.  Just the social recompense=20
part and we are beginning to flesh that out.

Alex:

Well, I hope Murat and all understand that I know I am taking a few=20
liberties and am trying to both have fun and be serious.  I am in the=20
doctorate program in writing at DU...we are so theory oriented all the=20=

time, sometimes I can get stuck in modes of thinking and get carried=20
away.

Flourishing I make mistakes...but it's in the mistakes where the good=20
things come from.

Did you notice that I wrote "analogical"?  I think I meant analogous. =20=

Analogical isn't a word is it?

I find this all invigorating.

Alex:

Actually, I thought I was supporting the reader's role in the process. =20=

I am going to quote Mary Robinson's poem, the one I mentioned in my=20
original response to illustrate my most pressing concern.  And to=20
distance myself from what appears to be a misunderstanding.  I am not=20
trying to misconstrue purposefully Murat's ideas to the list; I am=20
trying rather to eek from his statement--the one about social=20
recompense--something that appears to be a consistent historical issue=20=

in poetics.  Apropos, I have been writing a notebook about problems for=20=

poetics, three of which I recently wrote into my blog=20
(dagzine.blogspot.com).  May explain my preoccupations if you peeked at=20=

those posts.  To point:

The Poet's Garret

COME, sportive Fancy !=A0=A0Come with me, and trace
The poet's  Attic home !=A0=A0The lofty seat
Of th' Heaven-tutor'd Nine !=A0=A0The airy throne
Of bold Imagination, rapture-fraught,
Above the herd of mortals !--All around,
A solemn stillness seems to guard the scene,
Nursing the brood of thought; a thriving brood,
In the rich mazes of the cultur'd brain.
Upon thy altar, an old worm-eat board,
The pannel of a broken door, or lid
Of a strong coffer, plac'd on three-legg'd stool,
Stand quires of paper, white and beautiful;
Paper, by Destiny ordain'd to be
Scrawl'd o'er and blotted, dash'd and scratch'd, and torn,
Or mark'd with lines severe, or scatter'd wide
In rage impetuous !=A0=A0Sonnet, Song, and Ode;
Satire, and Epigram, and smart Charade;
Neat Paragraph, or legendary Tale
Of short and simple metre; each by turns
Will there delight the reader.
                                                    On the bed
Lies an old rusty "suit of solemn black,"--
Brush'd thread-bare, and with brown unglossy hue
Grown rather ancient.=A0=A0On the floor is seen
A pair of silken hose, whose footing bad
Shews they are travellers, but who still bear
Marks somewhat holy .=A0=A0At the scanty fire
A chop turns round; by packthread strongly held;
And on the blackened bar a vessel shines
Of batter'd pewter, just half-fill'd, and warm,
With Whitbread's  beverage pure.=A0=A0The kitten purs,
Anticipating dinner; while the wind
Whistles through broken panes, and drifted snow
Carpets the parapet with spotless garb
Of vestal coldness.--Now the sullen hour
(The fifth hour after noon) with dusky hand
Closes the lids of day.=A0=A0The farthing light
Gleams through the cobweb'd chamber, and THE  BARD
Concludes his pen's hard labour.=A0=A0Now he eats
With appetite voracious !=A0=A0Nothing sad
That the costly plate, nor the napkin fine,
Nor china rich, nor sav'ry viands greet
His eye, or palate.=A0=A0On his lyric board
A sheet of paper serves for table-cloth;
A heap of salt is serv'd (Oh ! heav'nly treat),
On Ode Pindaric ! =A0=A0while his tuneful Puss
Scratches his slipper, for her fragment sweet,
And sings her love-song, soft, yet mournfully.
Mocking the pillar Doric, or the roof
Of architecture Gothic, all around
The well-known ballads flit, of Grub-street fame !
The casement broke gives breath celestial
To the long "Dying Speech ," or gently fans
The love-enflaming Sonnet.=A0=A0'Round about
Small scraps of paper lie, torn vestiges
Of an unquiet fancy: here a page
Of flights poetic; here a Dedication;
A list of Dramatis Person=E6  bold,
Of heroes yet unborn, and lofty dames,
Of perishable compound "light as air,"
But sentenc'd to oblivion !
                                                        On a shelf,
Yclept a mantle-piece, a phial stands,
Half-fill'd with potent spirits, clear and strong,
Which sometimes haunt the Poet's restless brain,
And fill his mind with fancies whimsical.
Poor Poet !=A0=A0happy art thou, thus remov'd
 =46rom pride and folly !=A0=A0For, in thy domain
Thou cans't command thy subjects, fill thy lines
With the all-conqu'ring weapon Heav'n  bestows
In the grey-goose's wing !=A0=A0which, tow'ring high,
Bears thy rich fancy to immortal fame !

(I have written about Mary Robinson and, what I have come to refer to,=20=

her use of a "poetry of fancy-at work."   My term.)

Annotations:
on the title:  a) garret as a noun is an encampment, a pseudo-fortress,=20=

a place soldiers seek protection from attack from the outside. b)=20
garret as a verb is to build oneself into such a protection.  Or, to=20
encase.

Together, garret is important in reference to "the poet" because poet's=20=

seek encasement in history and maintain a special relationship to the=20
labor they expend in participating in their own encasement.  Such a=20
garret-ing is a building oneself a form of protective  shell from what?

So, right off GARRET is a phenomenological problem for the poet seems=20
required to close himself (the poet in Robinson's poem is most=20
certainly masculine) off from the public yet also seeks fame from the=20
public.

In the poet's crumbling, rotten garret where fancy can only be utilized=20=

through opiate use, and only in that garret can the poet who encases=20
himself write.  The problem is, as Robinson writes, "in thy domain/=20
Thou can'st command thy subjects" which she relates to "[filling] thy=20
lines" & "[wielding] th'all conqu'ring [pen]".

Now, this isn't a product of sportive fancy: a productive and fertile=20
fancy.  Such a fancy is "unquiet," and "sick."

This is the kind of poet who complains about readers' lack of knowledge=20=

of what he writes, and so he withdraws into the solitude of his garret=20=

in order to work without social recompense seeking a higher "immortal=20
fame."

So, I hope this puts into perspective where I am coming from just a bit.

First, I have been lately thinking about poetry and labor.  And have=20
been exploring how readers and writers cultivate the poem.  I am at the=20=

moment grounded in German Romanticism more than any other tradition:=20
Schiller, Holderlin...the poet differentiates between subject and=20
object...all that "stuff" in aesthetics.  Yes, Heidegger, too. =20
Although, I have already been scolded for reading and using Heidegger. =20=

Whatever that means.

Second, the labor in poetry that Robinson criticizes in the poem above=20=

is the kind written by poets who make claims about the value of labor=20
and distance themselves from culture--encase themselves in the sick=20
sublime tinctures of the hallowed work of the attic poet & garret=20
themselves from society.  I find this to be a shame.  Because I find=20
that poetry is worthless unless public.  So, I really am not at all=20
shunning the reader.  I am merely dealing with the writer at the=20
moment.  This is a poetics list populated by poetry folk in a=20
majoritarian sense; therefore, I think it a good idea to air out the=20
writer's closet before addressing the readers of poetry.

Alex:
> Is it true that the poet owns the poem, or has the reader a role to=20
> play in the socio-context of the work?

I think the reader and writer together determine the socio-context of=20
the work because they are both public figures.  In other words, I claim=20=

that no private reader or poet exists.

Alex:
>  And if so, what is that role?

Is it important to determine the role?  Might not it be worthwhile=20
enough to claim that in public there are particular moments in which=20
the poet and reader meet and those moments are able to be examined in=20
context but that such examinations are always only contemporaneous with=20=

other fortunate meetings between other poets and readers.  In other=20
words, we can talk (a la new criticism) about a poem out of context but=20=

that says nothing about the experience of writing the poem and reading=20=

the poem.  We can talk about the reading of the poem with the poet and=20=

the writing of the poem with the reader, but only one particular poem=20
at a time.  We can compare andn contrast many contemporary poems (a la=20=

Perloff) that are either written contemporaries or read contemporaries=20=

allowing for both a horizontal or vertical reading of poetry itself or=20=

a transversal reading of poetry that creates a poetics...I hope you're=20=

following my point about the problem with attempting say anything=20
general about the value of the labor in a poetic product.  Poetry is=20
not exchanged like a commodity even though we have adopted such general=20=

economic language to address the poetry market.

not much written, unfortunately about the disappearance of poetry from=20=

the everyday public sphere.  but such a dissertation would certainly=20
discover that sometime in the twentieth century poetry was purposefully=20=

co-opted by academia as a struggle to distinguish it as a primary and=20
special form that only specialists should have access to.  Poetics=20
became a language game.  Poetry didn't colonize public space any=20
longer, academia colonized poetic space.  Liberal Arts and Humanities=20
programs became institutionalized post wars to reinstill within the men=20=

postwar a version of being human that was for the most part authorized=20=

by the government and power elite.  So from the politician to the=20
political poet many people came together to find a place for poetry.

And now poets complain self-garreted about the lack of social=20
recompense.  And while Murat may have not been portraying that=20
position, he used the language.  I grasped onto that specific statement=20=

and ran with it.

Sure I lost touch with his explicit references.  yet language doesn't=20
really work on the level of the explicit, does it?  Most of the work=20
language does itself is carried out on the level of the implicit and=20
the inferred.  Quite frankly, inference belongs more to the=20
relationship or effect  utterances have on the hearer.  Once uttered=20
the speaker or poet, in this case, really has nothing to say until=20
responded to; hence, communicative action is positive because it=20
involves all parties within earshot.  Thankfully, at its core, it is=20
democratic.


Alex:
> How has the concept of having an audience affected the writer's=20
> creativity?

That's between the writer and his or her ego.  Do you write with your=20
audience *in* mind or do you write hoping you will be able to share=20
what you wrote?  For me, that's important.  I am compelled to write.  I=20=

write in bullets.  I type into my blog everyday or so, but I don't=20
WRITE unless I am pushed to.  I wish I had a schedule.  And I wish such=20=

a response to a need in me had something to do with creativity.  A=20
standard like creativity might be able to save me from myself.  You=20
know?:  I tried to paint when I was a kid and to sing.  I was no good. =20=

Creativity for writers is different.


Alex:
> Are some writer's avoiding certain words or phrases because they have=20=

> an aversion to upsetting a segment in the readership?

Well, as you can tell.  I don't have that problem.  And I don't think=20
most active writers do.  Nevertheless, I read writers who have such=20
worries and such a disposition is always apparent.  Just as apparent as=20=

a writing student who fills text with wordy constructions to eek out a=20=

ten page composition.  Such a disposition is a stupid writer's trick. =20=

This anxiety, though typically earnest, is a cheap way to engage a=20
reader.  "Listen to me," the author said, "I care for you."  The me/you=20=

conflation is engaging psychilogically at best.

Murat brought up Lear and I teased him about it...maybe I was rude. =20
But I wrote a thesis on Lear...I reread it after writing the last=20
response.  Boy I was precocious as an undergrad.  But Lear is the kind=20=

of author-ity who would have asked such a question.


Alex:
>  Worse, are some works written merely to appeal to a specific segment=20=

> of the readership world?

The mass market.  But then I sometimes enjoy a romp in the court of=20
appeals.


Alex:
>   Can the writer control his/her avoidance/embracing of a segment  of=20=

> the readership?

Sure.  As far as choosing to participate goes.  I quoted Robinson's=20
poem above because I think she shows the problem with choosing to=20
escape.

Long live the seal hunt

By REX MURPHY

UPDATED AT 4:56 PM EDT  Saturday, Apr. 17, 2004

It was the example of Christie Blatchford that has me doing this piece.
There she was, last Saturday in this very paper, blazing away with such
vigour and ‚lan on behalf of my long-suffering and weary countrymen, the
Newfoundland sealers. She's only been there "da once," as the expression
back home has it, yet what a noble, quick, ready response.

It must have come as a shock to our crowd. They have long given up on the
thought that anybody up here in Central Canada would unlock their lips in
a word of understanding or sympathy, and as far as looking for succour or
appreciation in the pages of the metropolitan press, it does not occur
even in their most uninhibited and hungry dreams.

I have fired many a salvo on their, on our, behalf in many a venue. But
there came a time - I believe it was just after one of the Different
Strokes pseudo-celebrities co-signed some appeal with that other mandarin
of exotic sensitivity, Loretta Swit (Hot Lips of M*A*S*H) on behalf of the
little tubs of blubber and fur that jam our coastlines - there came a time
in the 1980s, I say, when I simply gave up.

The army of pretension and caring was too numerous, their pieties too
thick, their press conferences too rehearsed and frequent, their guest
spots on late Johnny Carson or early Oprah too commanding, for it to seem
worthwhile any more either to rebut them or defend the honour and the
worthiness of the "swilers." Greenpeace, the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, every animal-rights prima donna, and whole plagues of
environmentalists - they were too many, too persistent, too professional
and, finally, too annoying.

Newfoundland was a playpen for the ostentatious hearts of all the
good-cause world. The baby seal with its Bambi-sized eyes and pristine
white coat was, as an icon, the very Piet… of activist environmentalism.
Throw in some Hollywood or European bimbo, and the combination summoned
the world's press to the innocent floes off Labrador or St. Anthony in
numbers only slightly less than the teeming seal herds themselves, and not
always, in point of intelligence, to be easily distinguished.

I have thought on more than one occasion in the last while that if even a
30th of the concern and a 10th of the press had been on offer in Rwanda,
for a real cause, Rom‚o Dallaire need never have had a single sleepless
night. But fawning over cute things is always more inviting than putting
some torque into the protest of real cruelties.

It was an eerie combination of farce, melodrama, photo op and fiction. The
early alarms that the hunt back then threatened the sleek little gluttons
-- seals are voracious and untidy eaters -- with extinction was malarkey,
and even the posing apocalyptics knew it. But it is a feature of
environmentalism-with-its-back-up that species must always be on the brink
of extinction, the world about to close down in a week, and the very
cosmos itself about to collapse in whimper or bang, unless cheques are
sent right away, and some innocent faction -- hunters, fishermen, or
farmers -- stop doing whatever makes it what it is, instanter! They
plastered Europe with their claims, pulled the usual theatrical stunts in
the media capitals of the world, and essentially ran a libel against
Newfoundland sealers for decades. By their account, the sealer was a
primitive, blood-lusting, barbarian lout out clubbing seals in some
Clockwork Orange of the North Atlantic.

There was never any appreciation, and more loathsomely, never any attempt
to achieve an appreciation, either of the history of the great hunt, the
desperation of the people who for generations prosecuted it, the
heart-rending exigencies of the out-harbour crews who were driven to it
and the great train of loss, wreckage and death that inscribed its
melancholy story.

The enviro-exhibitionists came to Newfoundland ignorant of Newfoundland
and Newfoundlanders, giddy with their shallow good intent, and obnoxiously
careless of the people and the culture they were so rudely, and
condescendingly, invading.

For a pious bunch, they had profound bad manners, and twisted the
hospitality and naive welcome they received -- and enjoyed -- into
something very like a betrayal of that hospitality and welcome.

The sealers woke up, some of them, seeing themselves ridiculed as material
for the propaganda posters against the seal hunt that hit every major
magazine and newspaper in the world.

This years' brief hunt brought back an echo of that great carnival, and I
was half determined to leave it alone. But Ms. Blatchford had her say
before me, and something close to shame has me making mine now. Long live
the seal hunt. Rex Murphy is a commentator with CBC-TV's The National and
host of CBC Radio One's Cross-Country Checkup.

What I meant by this is that Bush doesn't need his strut.  He has his
daddy and was a born a specific gender.  Hence he can rely on a certain
legacy of privilege that even Clinton had no access to.

Subject:      The Squashed Sphinx Has Your Rose
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

frozen dart mummies when up
skipped thirst just back behind foam -
their voice thawed equal to the shirt
in the back of your dresser, i.e., money
in exchange for lamentations, they see
these are the days when even the sky
hides acorns, they'll pour a fortune into
your nest and say "Here’s your silence..."
great white eye, the thieves' day, your, oh,
sight, comes with a special framed future brim-
ming with my disease, the perfect goes & with
the pumice comes the heart, your shoes will
bring snow into their deepest catacombs, when
the ice is severed we'll all come up ashes, or,
when the sand breaks alphabets will be pups out
your belly, somewhere under needle's mirror & step
there's the true moral of Poe's Tell-Tale Heart:
MONEY IN THE WALLS, scarabs boiling with gold
nuggets, scarabs already bliss, the rose you held soon
begins to bloom in the Squashed Sphinx's shoulder
it would rather live there than in a ravine of hands too
parched to float, furrow your cloud-blind heart for a
nest, come to know my gardens empty of paint (my
every other garden? - my every other garden is a set
of curtains, they lie lovely between scarabs now of
solid gold), soft cold winter, wake among beetles in
the cauldron stunned that I've spelled you with multiple
feet while the beetles have ten toes & mortgage payments
you'll all be milling about in a glass of silver sand, which
one of you said hands undivided will skip silence? know
only the inches are hanging the miles, the sky (see line
six) is gathering baskets of hours, perhaps you'd prefer
this? you can read between the lines or fill them in with,
say, when the sand breaks alphabets will be pups out
your belly, you could, I suppose, even stare with your
great white eye at, boundless, bare, the lone & level
sands stretching far away, a glass of silver instead of
a rose clutched in your mitts, etched with a needle's
mirror & step, its step stops just short before the foam

              A Passion for Poetry (and Profits)
            By STEPHEN KINZER

            Published: April 19, 2004


            HICAGO, April 18 - When John W. Barr was a teenager, he walked into his family's living room and announced that he had decided to become a poet.

            "That's fine," his father replied, "but go to college so people will think you're an eccentric, not just a beach bum."

            Mr. Barr followed that advice. He studied English literature at Harvard and later earned a business degree, became an investment banker and made a fortune on Wall Street. But he never lost his passion for poetry and now finds himself in a job that suits his rare combination of interests.

                 Advertisement


            Mr. Barr, 61, has moved to Chicago from New York to become president of the Poetry Foundation, with a challenge perhaps unique in the history of literature: deciding how to make use of a gift worth more than $100 million.

            The gift, which came in 2002 from Ruth Lilly, the pharmaceutical heiress, shook the world of American poetry.

            For most of the 20th century the Poetry Foundation was a small institution called the Modern Poetry Association. Although it was often on the brink of bankruptcy, its monthly magazine, Poetry, with a circulation of about 11,000, emerged as the most important journal of poetry in the United States. In 1915 it published for the first time a poem written in what was then a new form, free verse. The poem was "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," and it had been written a few years earlier by a 23-year-old named T. S. Eliot. Carl Sandburg's "Chicago Poems" and Wallace Stevens's "Sunday Morning" were also first published in it.

            Ms. Lilly's huge gift threw the organization first into ecstasy and then into confusion. In a move that stunned the tight-knit community of American poets, the magazine's longtime editor, Joseph Parisi, resigned last summer. Some took his departure as a signal that corporate auditors were pushing aside true lovers of literature. But, sitting in his Chicago office, Mr. Barr insisted that there would be no conflict between his commitment to good management and his love of poetry. He said Stevens and Eliot "broke a lot of ice for us all" by combining careers in business and poetry.

            "In both of these fields you use creativity to find order in a chaotic experience," he said. "Business does that in the external world. Poetry does it internally by way of articulation."

            "To me this is a historic opportunity in American poetry," Mr. Barr said. "Poetry helps us live better, helps us understand the human experience. It is with us at the heights and depths of that experience. Our goal is to get it in front of people whose lives it can change for the better. But I'm also very excited about the management opportunities.

            "I don't see any reason why a cultural organization can't be run like a good corporation. If we can do that, we'll not only be on the road to success ourselves but may even be able to give some ideas to other arts groups."

            He said his favorite poets ranged from Yeats to Billy Collins but added that he often wondered whether other masters might be working in secret. "I am always haunted by the thought that the poetry of today that will be celebrated a century from now is unknown to us now," he said.

            One of Mr. Barr's first tasks will be to propose how the Poetry Foundation should use its new wealth. Will it give grants to poets, sponsor public events, publish its own line of books, design poetry courses for high schools and colleges?

            "We haven't finished our search for the best ideas," he said. "We need to think of this as our first order of business."

            The chairwoman of the foundation's board, Deborah Cummins, said that after receiving Ms. Lilly's huge gift the foundation would change, but that "we've really had to stop, as a group, to consider what needs to be done and what we can now do."

            "It's new territory for us," she said. "We've been transformed from a fund-raising board to a management board, and then to a policy-making and guidance board that has to think of a grand vision."

            Some poets are concerned about what course the foundation may now follow and especially about the future of Poetry magazine. Mr. Parisi, its former editor, declined to comment on his departure, but others were less reticent.

            "I was very disconcerted by it, as were most poets in America," David Bottoms, the poet laureate of Georgia, said. "At this point I'd say American poets are a little bit fearful but also hopeful that the eclectic and very high-level quality that Joe represented will be continued. The last few issues under the new editor, Christian Wiman, have been very good, which is reassuring because that magazine is an American institution."

            "I'm very heartened that someone would give that kind of money to poetry or to any of the arts, but what they do with it is another question," Mr. Bottoms said.

            Tree Swenson, executive director of the Academy of American Poets, based in New York, said Mr. Barr was a good choice to lead the Poetry Foundation.

            "In a past life I ran an organization that received a large philanthropic gift, and I can tell you that it's really hard to manage change on that level," Ms. Swenson said. "Barr is one of the few people who have that combination, knowing the world of financial management from his business career and also being very knowledgeable not just about contemporary poetry but also about the organizations around this country that are working in the field. There's this notion that poetry and money don't mix, but that's just what it is, a romantic notion."

            Mr. Barr has published several books of poetry and has taught poetry at Sarah Lawrence. He said that much of what the foundation did with its new wealth would be aimed at expanding the audience for poetry in the United States, especially among young people.

            The Eminem film "8 Mile" was "full of poetry," Mr. Barr said. "I know we can find ways to reach out to people who enjoy that kind of thing."

WORKSHOPS

ANNOUNCING A SUMMER WORKSHOP WITH POET JORGE GUITART

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and
Literatures at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education  since
1984 and has led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the
author of Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press
1996). He is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

wanted to post a citation here that i'm sure many on this list will
find useful as hell:  ~critical intellectuals on writing~, ed. gary
a. olson and lynn worsham (suny press, 2003)... this volume is a
collection of interviews excerpted from the pages of ~jac~ (~journal
of advanced composition~)...

i just started reading it this morning---has taken me this long to
get to it after ordering it at mla!---and am finding it a great
summary of how different thinkers think about themselves as
writers... just the variance across answers to the initial question
generally posed---"do you think of yourself as a writer?"---provides
considerable food for thought...

here are the interviewees:

Gloria Anzaldua
Mary Field Belenky
Homi Bhabha
Judith Butler
Noam Chomsky
Donald Davidson
Jacques Derrida
Michael Eric Dyson
Stanley Fish
Paulo Freire
Clifford Geertz
Henry Giroux

if you haven't already, really worth checking out...

Falluja (report from 11 April)
by Jo Wilding--link to this article:
http://www.circus2iraq.org/updates.asp?page=61

US snipers in Falluja shoot unarmed man in the back, old woman with white
flag, children fleeing their homes and the ambulance that we were going
in to fetch a woman in premature labour.
Trucks, oil tankers, tanks are burning on the highway east to Falluja. A
stream of boys and men goes to and from a lorry that's not burnt,
stripping it bare. We turn onto the back roads through Abu Ghraib, Nuha
and Ahrar singing in Arabic, past the vehicles full of people and a few
possessions, heading the other way, past the improvised refreshment posts
along the way where boys throw food through the windows into the bus for
us and for the people inside still inside Falluja.

The bus is following a car with the nephew of a local sheikh and a guide
who has contacts with the Mujahedin and has cleared this with them. The
reason I'm on the bus is that a journalist I knew turned up at my door at
about 11 at night telling me things were desperate in Falluja, he'd been
bringing out children with their limbs blown off, the US soldiers were
going around telling people to leave by dusk or be killed, but then when
people fled with whatever they could carry, they were being stopped at
the US military checkpoint on the edge of town and not let out, trapped,
watching the sun go down.

He said aid vehicles and the media were being turned away. He said there
was some medical aid that needed to go in and there was a better chance
of it getting there with foreigners, westerners, to get through the
american checkpoints. The rest of the way was secured with the armed
groups who control the roads we'd travel on. We'd take in the medical
supplies, see what else we could do to help and then use the bus to bring
out people who needed to leave.

I'll spare you the whole decision making process, all the questions we
all asked ourselves and each other, and you can spare me the accusations
of madness, but what it came down to was this: if I don't do it, who
will? Either way, we arrive in one piece.

We pile the stuff in the corridor and the boxes are torn open
straightaway, the blankets most welcomed. It's not a hospital at all but
a clinic, a private doctor's surgery treating people free since air
strikes destroyed the town's main hospital. Another has been improvised
in a car garage. There's no anaesthetic. The blood bags are in a drinks
fridge and the doctors warm them up under the hot tap in an unhygienic
toilet.

Screaming women come in, praying, slapping their chests and faces. Ummi,
my mother, one cries. I hold her until Maki, a consultant and acting
director of the clinic, brings me to the bed where a child of about ten
is lying with a bullet wound to the head. A smaller child is being
treated for a similar injury in the next bed. A US sniper hit them and
their grandmother as they left their home to flee Falluja.

The lights go out, the fan stops and in the sudden quiet someone holds up
the flame of a cigarette lighter for the doctor to carry on operating by.
The electricity to the town has been cut off for days and when the
generator runs out of petrol they just have to manage till it comes back
on. Dave quickly donates his torch. The children are not going to live.

"Come," says Maki and ushers me alone into a room where an old woman has
just had an abdominal bullet wound stitched up. Another in her leg is
being dressed, the bed under her foot soaked with blood, a white flag
still clutched in her hand and the same story: I was leaving my home to
go to Baghdad when I was hit by a US sniper. Some of the town is held by
US marines, other parts by the local fighters. Their homes are in the US
controlled area and they are adamant that the snipers were US marines.

Snipers are causing not just carnage but also the paralysis of the
ambulance and evacuation services. The biggest hospital after the main
one was bombed is in US territory and cut off from the clinic by snipers.
The ambulance has been repaired four times after bullet damage. Bodies
are lying in the streets because no one can go to collect them without
being shot.

Some said we were mad to come to Iraq; quite a few said we were
completely insane to come to Falluja and now there are people telling me
that getting in the back of the pick up to go past the snipers and get
sick and injured people is the craziest thing they've ever seen. I know,
though, that if we don't, no one will.

He's holding a white flag with a red crescent on; I don't know his name.
The men we pass wave us on when the driver explains where we're going.
The silence is ferocious in the no man's land between the pick up at the
edge of the Mujahedin territory, which has just gone from our sight
around the last corner and the marines' line beyond the next wall; no
birds, no music, no indication that anyone is still living until a gate
opens opposite and a woman comes out, points.

We edge along to the hole in the wall where we can see the car, spent
mortar shells around it. The feet are visible, crossed, in the gutter. I
think he's dead already. The snipers are visible too, two of them on the
corner of the building. As yet I think they can't see us so we need to
let them know we're there.

"Hello," I bellow at the top of my voice. "Can you hear me?" They must.
They're about 30 metres from us, maybe less, and it's so still you could
hear the flies buzzing at fifty paces. I repeat myself a few times, still
without reply, so decide to explain myself a bit more.

"We are a medical team. We want to remove this wounded man. Is it OK for
us to come out and get him? Can you give us a signal that it's OK?"

I'm sure they can hear me but they're still not responding. Maybe they
didn't understand it all, so I say the same again. Dave yells too in his
US accent. I yell again. Finally I think I hear a shout back. Not sure, I
call again.

"Hello."

"Yeah."

"Can we come out and get him?"

"Yeah,"

Slowly, our hands up, we go out. The black cloud that rises to greet us
carries with it a hot, sour smell. Solidified, his legs are heavy. I
leave them to Rana and Dave, our guide lifting under his hips. The
Kalashnikov is attached by sticky blood to is hair and hand and we don't
want it with us so I put my foot on it as I pick up his shoulders and his
blood falls out through the hole in his back. We heave him into the pick
up as best we can and try to outrun the flies.

I suppose he was wearing flip flops because he's barefoot now, no more
than 20 years old, in imitation Nike pants and a blue and black striped
football shirt with a big 28 on the back. As the orderlies form the
clinic pull the young fighter off the pick up, yellow fluid pours from
his mouth and they flip him over, face up, the way into the clinic
clearing in front of them, straight up the ramp into the makeshift
morgue.

We wash the blood off our hands and get in the ambulance. There are
people trapped in the other hospital who need to go to Baghdad. Siren
screaming, lights flashing, we huddle on the floor of the ambulance,
passports and ID cards held out the windows. We pack it with people, one
with his chest taped together and a drip, one on a stretcher, legs
jerking violently so I have to hold them down as we wheel him out,
lifting him over steps.

The hospital is better able to treat them than the clinic but hasn't got
enough of anything to sort them out properly and the only way to get them
to Baghdad on our bus, which means they have to go to the clinic. We're
crammed on the floor of the ambulance in case it's shot at. Nisareen, a
woman doctor about my age, can't stop a few tears once we're out.

The doctor rushes out to meet me: "Can you go to fetch a lady, she is
pregnant and she is delivering the baby too soon?"

Azzam is driving, Ahmed in the middle directing him and me by the window,
the visible foreigner, the passport. Something scatters across my hand,
simultaneous with the crashing of a bullet through the ambulance, some
plastic part dislodged, flying through the window.

We stop, turn off the siren, keep the blue light flashing, wait, eyes on
the silhouettes of men in US marine uniforms on the corners of the
buildings. Several shots come. We duck, get as low as possible and I can
see tiny red lights whipping past the window, past my head. Some, it's
hard to tell, are hitting the ambulance I start singing. What else do you
do when someone's shooting at you? A tyre bursts with an enormous noise
and a jerk of the vehicle.

I'm outraged. We're trying to get to a woman who's giving birth without
any medical attention, without electricity, in a city under siege, in a
clearly marked ambulance, and you're shooting at us. How dare you?

How dare you?

Azzam grabs the gear stick and gets the ambulance into reverse, another
tyre bursting as we go over the ridge in the centre of the road , the
sots still coming as we flee around the corner. I carry on singing. The
wheels are scraping, burst rubber burning on the road.

The men run for a stretcher as we arrive and I shake my head. They spot
the new bullet holes and run to see if we're OK. Is there any other way
to get to her, I want to know. La, maaku tarieq. There is no other way.
They say we did the right thing. They say they've fixed the ambulance
four times already and they'll fix it again but the radiator's gone and
the wheels are buckled and se's still at home in the dark giving birth
alone. I let her down.

We can't go out again. For one thing there's no ambulance and besides
it's dark now and that means our foreign faces can't protect the people
who go out with us or the people we pick up. Maki is the acting director
of the place. He says he hated Saddam but now he hates the Americans
more.

We take off the blue gowns as the sky starts exploding somewhere beyond
the building opposite. Minutes later a car roars up to the clinic. I can
hear him screaming before I can see that there's no skin left on his
body. He's burnt from head to foot. For sure there's nothing they can do.
He'll die of dehydration within a few days.

Another man is pulled from the car onto a stretcher. Cluster bombs, they
say, although it's not clear whether they mean one or both of them. We
set off walking to Mr Yasser's house, waiting at each corner for someone
to check the street before we cross. A ball of fire falls from a plane,
splits into smaller balls of bright white lights. I think they're cluster
bombs, because cluster bombs are in the front of my mind, but they
vanish, just magnesium flares, incredibly bright but short-lived, giving
a flash picture of the town from above.

Yasser asks us all to introduce ourselves. I tell him I'm training to be
a lawyer. One of the other men asks whether I know about international
law. They want to know about the law on war crimes, what a war crime is.
I tell them I know some of the Geneva Conventions, that I'll bring some
information next time I come and we can get someone to explain it in
Arabic.

We bring up the matter of Nayoko. This group of fighters has nothing to
do with the ones who are holding the Japanese hostages, but while they're
thanking us for what we did this evening, we talk about the things Nayoko
did for the street kids, how much they loved her. They can't promise
anything but that they'll try and find out where she is and try to
persuade the group to let her and the others go. I don't suppose it will
make any difference. They're busy fighting a war in Falluja. They're
unconnected with the other group. But it can't hurt to try.

The planes are above us all night so that as I doze I forget I'm not on a
long distance flight, the constant bass note of an unmanned
reconnaissance drone overlaid with the frantic thrash of jets and the
dull beat of helicopters and interrupted by the explosions.

In the morning I make balloon dogs, giraffes and elephants for the little
one, Abdullah, Aboudi, who's clearly distressed by the noise of the
aircraft and explosions. I blow bubbles which he follows with his eyes.
Finally, finally, I score a smile. The twins, thirteen years old, laugh
too, one of them an ambulance driver, both said to be handy with a
Kalashnikov.

The doctors look haggard in the morning. None has slept more than a
couple of hours a night for a week. One as had only eight hours of sleep
in the last seven days, missing the funerals of his brother and aunt
because he was needed at the hospital.

"The dead we cannot help," Jassim said. "I must worry about the injured."

We go again, Dave, Rana and me, this time in a pick up. There are some
sick people close to the marines' line who need evacuating. No one dares
come out of their house because the marines are on top of the buildings
shooting at anything that moves. Saad fetches us a white flag and tells
us not to worry, he's checked and secured the road, no Mujahedin will
fire at us, that peace is upon us, this eleven year old child, his face
covered with a keffiyeh, but for is bright brown eyes, his AK47 almost as
tall as he is.

We shout again to the soldiers, hold up the flag with a red crescent
sprayed onto it. Two come down from the building, cover this side and
Rana mutters, "Allahu akbar. Please nobody take a shot at them."

We jump down and tell them we need to get some sick people from the
houses and they want Rana to go and bring out the family from the house
whose roof they're on. Thirteen women and children are still inside, in
one room, without food and water for the last 24 hours.

"We're going to be going through soon clearing the houses," the senior
one says.

"What does that mean, clearing the houses?"

"Going into every one searching for weapons." He's checking his watch,
can't tell me what will start when, of course, but there's going to be
air strikes in support. "If you're going to do tis you gotta do it soon."

First we go down the street we were sent to. There's a man, face down, in
a white dishdasha, a small round red stain on his back. We run to him.
Again the flies ave got there first. Dave is at his shoulders, I'm by his
knees and as we reach to roll him onto the stretcher Dave's hand goes
through his chest, through the cavity left by the bullet that entered so
neatly through his back and blew his heart out.

There's no weapon in his hand. Only when we arrive, his sons come out,
crying, shouting. He was unarmed, they scream. He was unarmed. He just
went out the gate and they shot him. None of them have dared come out
since. No one had dared come to get his body, horrified, terrified,
forced to violate the traditions of treating the body immediately. They
couldn't have known we were coming so it's inconceivable tat anyone came
out and retrieved a weapon but left the body.

He was unarmed, 55 years old, shot in the back.

We cover his face, carry him to the pick up. There's nothing to cover his
body with. The sick woman is helped out of the house, the little girls
around her hugging cloth bags to their bodies, whispering, "Baba. Baba."
Daddy. Shaking, they let us go first, hands up, around the corner, then
we usher them to the cab of the pick up, shielding their heads so they
can't see him, the cuddly fat man stiff in the back.

The people seem to pour out of the houses now in the hope we can escort
them safely out of the line of fire, kids, women, men, anxiously asking
us whether they can all go, or only the women and children. We go to ask.
The young marine tells us that men of fighting age can't leave. What's
fighting age, I want to know. He contemplates. Anything under forty five.
No lower limit.

It appals me that all those men would be trapped in a city which is about
to be destroyed. Not all of them are fighters, not all are armed. It's
going to happen out of the view of the world, out of sight of the media,
because most of the media in Falluja is embedded with the marines or
turned away at the outskirts. Before we can pass the message on, two
explosions scatter the crowd in the side street back into their houses.

Rana's with the marines evacuating the family from the house they're
occupying. The pick up isn't back yet. The families are hiding behind
their walls. We wait, because there's nothing else we can do. We wait in
no man's land. The marines, at least, are watching us through binoculars;
maybe the local fighters are too.

I've got a disappearing hanky in my pocket so while I'm sitting like a
lemon, nowhere to go, gunfire and explosions aplenty all around, I make
the hanky disappear, reappear, disappear. It's always best, I think, to
seem completely unthreatening and completely unconcerned, so no one
worries about you enough to shoot. We can't wait too long though. Rana's
been gone ages. We have to go and get her to hurry. There's a young man
in the group. She's talked them into letting him leave too.

A man wants to use his police car to carry some of the people, a couple
of elderly ones who can't walk far, the smallest children. It's missing a
door. Who knows if he was really a police car or the car was
reappropriated and just ended up there? It didn't matter if it got more
people out faster. They creep from their houses, huddle by the wall,
follow us out, their hands up too, and walk up the street clutching
babies, bags, each other.

The pick up gets back and we shovel as many onto it as we can as an
ambulance arrives from somewhere. A young man waves from the doorway of
what's left of a house, his upper body bare, a blood soaked bandage
around his arm, probably a fighter but it makes no difference once
someone is wounded and unarmed. Getting the dead isn't essential. Like
the doctor said, the dead don't need help, but if it's easy enough then
we will. Since we're already OK with the soldiers and the ambulance is
here, we run down to fetch them in. It's important in Islam to bury the
body straightaway.

The ambulance follows us down. The soldiers start shouting in English at
us for it to stop, pointing guns. It's moving fast. We're all yelling,
signalling for it to stop but it seems to take forever for the driver to
hear and see us. It stops. It stops, before they open fire. We haul them
onto the stretchers and run, shove them in the back. Rana squeezes in the
front with the wounded man and Dave and I crouch in the back beside the
bodies. He says he had allergies as a kid and hasn't got much sense of
smell. I wish, retrospectively, for childhood allergies, and stick my
head out the window.

The bus is going to leave, taking the injured people back to Baghdad, the
man with the burns, one of the women who was shot in the jaw and shoulder
by a sniper, several others. Rana says she's staying to help. Dave and I
don't hesitate: we're staying too. "If I don't do it, who will?" has
become an accidental motto and I'm acutely aware after the last foray how
many people, how many women and children, are still in their houses
either because they've got nowhere to go, because they're scared to go
out of the door or because they've chosen to stay.

To begin with it's agreed, then Azzam says we have to go. He hasn't got
contacts with every armed group, only with some. There are different
issues to square with each one. We need to get these people back to
Baghdad as quickly as we can. If we're kidnapped or killed it will cause
even more problems, so it's better that we just get on the bus and leave
and come back with him as soon as possible.

It hurts to climb onto the bus when the doctor has just asked us to go
and evacuate some more people. I hate the fact that a qualified medic
can't travel in the ambulance but I can, just because I look like the
sniper's sister or one of his mates, but that's the way it is today and
the way it was yesterday and I feel like a traitor for leaving, but I
can't see where I've got a choice. It's a war now and as alien as it is
to me to do what I'm told, for once I've got to.

Jassim is scared. He harangues Mohammed constantly, tries to pull him out
of the driver's seat wile we're moving. The woman with the gunshot wound
is on the back seat, the man with the burns in front of her, being fanned
with cardboard from the empty boxes, his intravenous drips swinging from
the rail along the ceiling of the bus. It's hot. It must be unbearable
for him.

Saad comes onto the bus to wish us well for the journey. He shakes Dave's
hand and then mine. I hold his in both of mine and tell him "Dir balak,"
take care, as if I could say anything more stupid to a pre-teen Mujahedin
with an AK47 in his other hand, and our eyes meet and stay fixed, his
full of fire and fear.

Can't I take him away? Can't I take him somewhere he can be a child?
Can't I make him a balloon giraffe and give him some drawing pens and
tell him not to forget to brush his teeth? Can't I find the person who
put the rifle in the hands of that little boy? Can't I tell someone about
what that does to a child? Do I have to leave him here where there are
heavily armed men all around him and lots of them are not on his side,
however many sides there are in all of this? And of course I do. I do
have to leave him, like child soldiers everywhere.

The way back is tense, the bus almost getting stuck in a dip in the sand,
people escaping in anything, even piled on the trailer of a tractor,
lines of cars and pick ups and buses ferrying people to the dubious
sanctuary of Baghdad, lines of men in vehicles queuing to get back into
the city having got their families to safety, either to fight or to help
evacuate more people. The driver, Jassim, the father, ignores Azzam and
takes a different road so that suddenly we're not following the lead car
and we're on a road that's controlled by a different armed group than the
ones which know us.

A crowd of men waves guns to stop the bus. Somehow they apparently
believe that there are American soldiers on the bus, as if they wouldn't
be in tanks or helicopters, and there are men getting out of their cars
with shouts of "Sahafa Amreeki," American journalists. The passengers
shout out of the windows, "Ana min Falluja," I am from Falluja. Gunmen
run onto the bus and see that it's true, there are sick and injured and
old people, Iraqis, and then relax, wave us on.

We stop in Abu Ghraib and swap seats, foreigners in the front, Iraqis
less visible, headscarves off so we look more western. The American
soldiers are so happy to see westerners they don't mind too much about
the Iraqis with us, search the men and the bus, leave the women
unsearched because there are no women soldiers to search us. Mohammed
keeps asking me if things are going to be OK.

"Al-melaach wiyana, " I tell him. The angels are with us. He laughs.

And then we're in Baghdad, delivering them to the hospitals, Nuha in
tears as they take the burnt man off groaning and whimpering. She puts
her arms around me and asks me to be her friend. I make her feel less
isolated, she says, less alone.

And the satellite news says the cease-fire is holding and George Bush
says to the troops on Easter Sunday that, "I know what we're doing in
Iraq is right." Shooting unarmed men in the back outside their family
home is right. Shooting grandmothers with white flags is right? Shooting
at women and children who are fleeing their homes is right? Firing at
ambulances is right?

Well George, I know too now. I know what it looks like when you brutalise
people so much that they've nothing left to lose. I know what it looks
like when an operation is being done without anaesthetic because the
hospitals are destroyed or under sniper fire and the city's under siege
and aid isn't getting in properly. I know what it sounds like too. I know
what it looks like when tracer bullets are passing your head, even though
you're in an ambulance. I know what it looks like when a man's chest is
no longer inside him and what it smells like and I know what it looks
like when his wife and children pour out of his house.

    Okay, it's in the paper now, so I guess we can go public ...
    Campus Co-op wants to knock down Coach House Press.
    See today's Globe and Mail for details.
    Seems to me a good first step would be to send many
    letters to the Globe supporting CH and letting Campus
    Co-op know that their name will stink if they go
    through with this.

“Lucifer”
by Rod Smith

Viaduct off-spring of a slinkie

salesperson

Divorce
 or
          acutely vivid--

(welp)

dyspeptic area code
yet recombinatory, on ceremonial
disturbed water stoop

Say the sound
&/or slay the swingline

Some say need
is a statutory explanation
of the mobility
of synchronicity.
Most of them are guiltyof democratic leanings.

from “The Monstrous Failure of Contemplation”
by Mark Wallace

Do you believe this story
zombies are eating human flesh
the creature looks like one of us
do you believe this story
they were trained in the slaughterhouse
it pulled her down the sink
do you believe this story
nuclear ant crushes a truck
dead Indians rise from a grave

The industry of fear
millions of dollars a year

“As a child, blood and gore
actually comforted me, because I forgot
the tension upstairs.
It was only later I learned
I was an alien.”

from “Dear [Blank] I Believe in Other Worlds”
by K. Lorraine Graham

Everything flips. Say: it’s a thing! and it flips and says look at me I’m a
thing, a speaking thing! and so we think to ourselves outloud and so
perhaps to
others I wonder how can this be this thing-no-longer-thing is speaking and
I am
filled with either horror or with love: and so it’s a boring flip and hardly a
flip at all, churchbells sounding high above an oil rig, real and true and
trying to tie themselves to things, some things more than others, some with or
without makeup on, or covered in skin and vein and eventually unbleached un
arranged bones that have not been placed in closets but instead lovingly
reanimated into zombies via gigantic cauldrons, usually stolen from small
Celtic countries and returned as peace offerings via weddings in times of war.

UbuWeb is pleased to announce the launch of our newest E-Book series, /ubu Editions
(pronounced "slash ubu"). The Spring 2004 series, featuring 18 titles, is edited by Brian
Kim Stefans and features a mix of reprints and new material presented in book-length PDF
files. Each title is beautifully designed and features images from the UbuWeb site.

Eclat
Caroline Bergvall
56 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/bergvall_eclat.html

The product of a year-long collaboration between Bergvall and the designer Marit
Meunzberg, /ubu's web version of Eclat ups the ante on what can be done with a poetry
e-book. The print version of Eclat, a slender yellow-covered volume, first appeared from
chris cheek's Sound & Language press in England in 1997; the text itself was the
byproduct, or page interpretation, of a walk-through performance environment that
Bergvall had developed the previous year. This Acrobat version is the first in our series
to use color as a central component, thereby complicating the screen-to-print
relationship and foregrounding the invisible DMZs of technological remediation, but it
also investigates the very architectural borders of a computer text file, files that
imitate the "white page" in their conformity to standard paper sizes, thus turning the
once innocent "margin" into a malleable facet of its poetic grammar (and the page into a
frame of a flip-book). Language is spatialized, space is rendered syntactical by the
conversion of lines and dots into periods and commas. This document, a sort of fetish
object in itself despite its infinite reproducibility, makes of our screens and printers
vessels of language.


Situation Comedies: Foxy Moron
Barbara Cole
50 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/cole_foxy.html

Cole's writing exists somewhere between the genres of public confession that we associate
with the late Spalding Gray – in this way, a form of drama, but in a distinctly American
humorist tradition – and the large-scale collage works of someone like Ted Berrigan or
Bruce Andrews, moving ramblingly but assured through the juxtapositions between
pop-culture jingles and the delectable traumas (to a teenager) of sexual catharsis. Some
of the movement of Foxy Moron doesn't feel terribly poetic, at least in a Romantic sense;
a lot from "life" drops in wholesale, without the lyric ego to compromise its corporate
vulgarity (in the case of the product displacements) or libidinal urgency, but that is
the strength of the work: to remain narrative, engaging and funny despite being suspended
in a sort of late-Projective stew, vulnerable to poetic processes of collage and
hyper-reference. The full-frontal nature of its sexuality along with the glorious
suburbanism of its setting and conceit, which revels in the mundane, are a far cry from
the high-minded pseudo-historicism that has taken some control over the world of poetry.


Linear C & The I and the You
Jean Day
84 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/day_linear.html

Though she might seem over-shadowed by some of her West Coast peers, such as Rae
Armantrout or Kit Robinson, as the "lyric" Language poet, Day – who has been wary of such
group associations – has quietly amassed a body of exquisitely constructed lyrics and
longer sequences over the past two decades that have long deserved a greater reputation.
She has continued to expand her range in such books as 1998's The Literal World, with
their variable stanza patterns that can resemble at times Williams' late improvisations,
while not straying too much from a cross-hair precision with sentence construction and a
careful attention to visual and social details. Linear C first appeared as a Tuumba
chapbook (part of the legendary series edited by Lyn Hejinian), and is a small
tour-de-force of verse forms, including prose poems and poems that are aggregates of
short stanzas. "The I and the You" was the final section of her Potes and Poets volume of
the same title, and it anticipates the work with serial forms – this one governed by pa
Buber-esque consideration of personal ontology through relationships – that would come to
fruition in The Literal World.


Smokes
Craig Dworkin
59 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/dworkin_smokes.html

Dworkin's writing over the past decade has involved some of the most strenuous examples
of "conceptual writing" – replacing the words of a nineteenth century treatise on
diagramming sentences into their antiquated grammatical terms, for example – as well as
some of the more giddy soundscapes to come out of the practice of phonetic translations.
An prolific essayist with an eye for paradox – his paragraphs can often turn on the
misreading of a phrase that, in the end, turns out to be the only reading possible – it's
fitting that, in Smokes, he turns his attention to the minimal concrete poem (a la Aram
Saroyan and Robert Grenier), poems never reducible to single-line summations or
dismissible as eye candy, but manage to tease with the perpetual promise of profundity
looming in their translucent depths: "CLUE / that which holds / a tension." More allusive
than either Grenier or Saroyan's short poems – some of these three-liners use as many
languages as a short Canto – they are nonetheless infected with a comparable witty charm,
augmented by the fact that they were originally published on cigarette papers, rolled and
ready to inhale, taking the Sentences idea one step closer to immolation.


Rough Bush and other poems
Deanna Ferguson
86 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/ferguson_bush.html

Ferguson's long-awaited follow-up to her debut volume, Relative Minor, adds to the image
of this writer's integrity with its strong sonic qualities and extravagant, but never
indulgent, syntactic and verse architectures in the service of serious intellectual
concerns. By turns as machine-gun witted and caustic as one of her dedicatees, Lenny
Bruce, then as vulnerable and fluid as the writings of O'Hara or Hejinian, Ferguson also
manages the turn from the personal to the civic that is a hallmark of Kootenay School
writing (think Jeff Derksen and Lisa Robertson): "your brown lashes flutter revealing two
/ perfect orbs, a perfect morning, coloured / by the State." Each of these poems, even
the still-point of "t & tenth & alma," are performances, sometimes metrically baroque and
syncopated, sometimes, as in "Turf Builder," extending from a simple basal sonic unit,
managing wide variations without straying from a central one-or-two word line. One of the
central poets discussed in Sianne Ngai's essay "Poetics of Disgust," Ferguson runs the
poem through enough attitude to make even the punctuation marks mercenaries in the march
on capital.



This Window Makes Me Feel
Robert Fitterman
77 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/fitterman_window.html

For the past several years, Fitterman has been exploring a poetics of "sampling," taking
the practice of collage and procedural writing into the computer age, away from the edgy,
splice-based works of Ashbery's Tennis Court Oath and Berrigan's Sonnets, to something
akin to the seamless web of cut-and-paste in music composed with digital tools. Such
minimal, often "ambient" pieces give the impression that, with the right algorithms and a
limitless database, the poem could potentially go on forever and never repeat itself.
This Window Makes Me Feel, like "Flarf" and Google poems (or the yet to be realized
"Apostrophe Engine"), is based on sentences collected from search engines, but Fitterman
creates a rich, understated emotional core to the work by the repeated motif of the title
phrase, which balances on the delicate irony that something generally considered
"invisible" (i.e. transparent) has become the subject of a civic meditation. The
dedication to the victims of the World Trade Center attack seals this work as a response
to trauma, a spiraling reaching-out to a wall of stability which, to the eye, had never
been previously remarked.



Name, a novel
Toadex Hobogrammathon
137 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/toadex_name.html

Name is about as close as one can get to a "novel" that was written by a machine and for
a machine: it seems especially primed to attract and repel spam-blockers with its
hardcore-porn opening, and yet it also tosses a distracting bone to the bots with its
stream of seemingly random verbiage after its first paragraphs. Far as we can tell, Name
is the exorbitant creation of a single human being who is known only by the name of
"Toadex Hobogrammathon," the same person who created the Jarry-esque, day-glo colored
website Dagmar's Chili Pitas, the only "poetry" blog that renders even the marginal
trappings of the format itself – such as the date, tables, fonts, colors, etc. – fodder
for its neo-Dada somersaults. But Name turns out to be a good read, perhaps more along
the line of Kenny Goldsmith's barnstorming procedural projects or Peter Manson's
aggregation of junk phrases, Adjunct, than anything from Toni Morrison or Alan Davies,
but nonetheless something to keep the retina fused to the screen, with a furious,
decidedly No Wave soundtrack to boot. This is the perfect novel to run your computer's
voice emulator on in the background while you while away precious life at the office.


Cruise of the Pnyx
Robert Kelly
40 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/kelly_pnyx.html

Originally published in 1979, Cruise of the Pnyx predates Kelly's several books of short
fictions – four volumes appeared between 1985 and 1994 – and yet shares many affinities
with those and his novel The Scorpions (1969), building their rich atmospheres through
the careful accumulation of details, and largely concerned with unraveling preternatural
mysteries, investigating alternative currents of being that never depart wholly from what
one might witness in "real life." Written in three distinct forms – left-justified verse,
full-justified prose and a right-justified "between-rider, or transitional grade between
poetry and prose," or a "prose song" – Pnyx shares affinities with Pound's Cantos and
with "global" novels such as Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow or V, all three works of which
seem to occupy a still place – a Lethean "cruise" – in the center of a world figured as a
vortex of the detritus of culture. The present edition represents the 46 pages of the
publication with a one-to-one correspondence, preserving the many interplays that occur
from the left to right pages between writing styles. This is a uniquely pleasurable read,
and an obscure one from the large corpus of Robert Kelly's writings.


São Paolo
Madelyn Kent
100 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/kent_sao.html

Kent, a young New York playwright, has investigated an aesthetics of extreme slowness
that permits her to descend deep into the breaks of syntax that occur in language as it
is spoken by non-native English speakers. Her dramaturgy, influenced by traditions of
Butoh though in no way exoticized, involves precise, incredibly slow movement coupled
with dialogue spoken at chthonic pace. Her themes are often humanistic with an interest
in politics and world events as they affect one on the most intimate levels, and language
as it cracks and reforms when traversing cultural bounds. Her "shufu" plays, of which São
Paolo is an example, are written as collaborations with her Japanese ESL students
("shufu" means "housewife" in Japanese) who create, in workshop-like situations, the
plots, character names, and, finally, grammar, in that these plays preserve the ticks,
glitches and vulnerabilities of a person speaking English as a second-language. This is
not "imperfect" English, nor is it a heedless act of formal avant-gardism, but a language
that bears the marks of their transport from a singular heart and mind into the general
world-space, from a fluid interior into the superego of syntax.


The Mauberley Series
Aaron Kunin
30 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/kunin_mauberley.html

The Mauberley Series takes some cue from such works as Kit Robinson's Dolch Stanzas by
constraining itself to the use of a closed vocabulary while engaging in a highly
philosophical and formal play that examines the lyric interior of this seemingly
arbitrary set. But whereas Robinson used a lexicon that was created for cultural reasons
– the "approved words" of Simplified English – Kunin's The Mauberley Sequence uses the
words that were transmitted to the poet through his irrepressible hand as it beat out
phrases on a table involuntarily. Like many of Kunin's poems, this one describes a
spiritual universe that is on the verge of being subsumed by the ironizing force of
mundane psychology; the words "Jesus" and "moron," "rats" and "pleasure" are in constant
motion in this recombination machine. Additionally, the sequence is exquisitely mapped on
Ezra Pound's 1920 "farewell to London," Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, a virtual encyclopedia of
meters by the then-young poet, dashing through the Greek of Bion, the chiseled rhymes of
Gautier, the drawn-out sentences of Henry James and the wild satire of Vorticism. Kunin's
response, from within the space of his limned but not comfortable vocabulary, echoes
Pound's line-by-line, in a play of logopoaeia that is stunning and absorbing.


Trancelated (from Coinsides)
Ira Lightman
68 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/lightman_trance.html


Lightman creates a universe of mirrors in his continuing poetic sequence Coinsides,
though not mirrors as reflections so much as translations, with one part of a
middle-justified poem responding to one or more other center-justified parts, prey to the
same invisible gravity. There is no set procedure – this is an artist's diary if anything
and follows the caprices of the days – but one half usually involves a modified
translations of writing by Lightman's poetic and philosophical predecessors (Baudelaire,
Horace and St. Augustine among others), and the other half is a response which can take
on any number of forms of address, including the minimal Creeley-esque lyric, the Langpo
stew, or, most distinctly, the spontaneously spiritual or religious affirmation, making
him sound often like a latter-day Henry Vaughn or, with his prolixity, John Clare.
"Trancelated" is a somewhat random, though thematically coherent, selection from the
ongoing project, a bouquet of sorts of what can be called word sculptures – they
challenge the rectilinear rightness on more than four fronts – or even musical
compositions: Lightman, an avid fan of Stockhausen, views all of his text works as scores
to an aural, if not conventionally "musical," performance.


Spleen: Thirty-one versions of Baudelaire's Je suis comme le roi...
Nicholas Moore
56 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/moore_spleen.html

Moore was considered one of the leading English poets of the Forties, winning major
awards on both sides of the pond, and in line to be among the successors of the
generation of Auden, MacNeice and Spender. Several personal misfortunes along with a few
mysterious circumstances (undiagnosed diabetes possibly among them) made him retire from
public view in the following decades until he was nearly entirely unknown. Soon he was
considered an eccentric, fit only for the fringes, prolific, dexterous, but hardly
someone for the pages of the London Review of Books. The thirty-one poems of Spleen – in
voices ranging from H.D.'s to Kenneth Rexroth's, Bob Dylan's to Bee-Bop scat – were
submitted to a contest being judged by George Steiner for the Sunday Times and mailed
from several locations around London (a long introduction, included in this volume,
explains the circumstances of the writing). The project, though a product of Moore's own
personal demons regarding the problems of translation, not to mention his own desolation
and the ironies of his once promising life, falls in line with any number of more
conceptually aligned works such as Pound's Homage to Sextus Propertius, Queneau's Cent
Mille Milliard de Poèmes, and the giddy conceits and deceptions of Ern Malley, Araki
Yasusada, and Roger Pellett.


Spaghetti Dreadful (trailer for A Penny Dreadful)
Gustave Morin
38 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/morin_spaghetti.html

Morin extends the tradition of "Concrete" poetry into a space of incredible visual
subtlety, such that one can link him, without embarrassment, to the works of image-makers
ranging from Goya to his countryman Guy Maddin, from the deep prehistory of Radical
Graphic artists (where Marshall MacLuhan and Quentin Fiore of The Medium is the Massage
hold court) to the low-tech work of those working in zines and the traditions of "dirty
concrete." More than sophisticated "one-liners," Morin's work encourages one to look
closer: even as one rationalizes and "consumes" the various components of the image,
settling on a static, reproducible "meaning" is difficult without betrayal of the
semantic aura.  This "trailer" (as in movie preview) of his sepia-tinged A Penny Dreadful
should encourage many to go the extra yard and purchase this graphic "novel" that is also
a valuable satiric commentary on the benighted paths our planet is treading.


Circadium
Larry Price
90 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/price_circadium.html

Circadium, with its headline-size opening gambits playing reveille for its heady prose
meditations (often in the form of short fictions), has the surface appearance of
Conceptual art – the specter, in both form and content, of the work of Joseph Kosuth,
looms large here, as does the seriousness with which issues of art, money, the market,
the self and the spectacular "writing on the wall" plays in this echo-chamber of
counterpointed thematics. The power of enigma and myth, of absurdity and intellect, never
wavers or weakens in these obsessive ruminations on the "eye" in the "world" – "While on
behalf of this half of what halves us, we dress each thought in lesion. Nothing could be
simpler." Disgust and alienation – classic resonances with a bygone literature of
Nietzschean aphorism – gird these poems, lifting them above the now-standard practice of
"New Sentence" poetry which can often seem an elite form of diary-writing, or the
magical-realist version of a domesticated avant-gardism that a nostalgia for Surrealism
has fostered. Circadium is hard but rewarding writing that updates a powerfully
subversive strand of literature, one in which a rapier intellect guides the whiplash of
form.



Gulf & Alpha Betty's Chronicles
Brian Kim Stefans
http://ubu.com/ubu/stefans_alpha.html
http://ubu.com/ubu/stefans_gulf.html

Gulf, a collection of both my more "lyric" and procedural writings from the mid-nineties,
first appeared in the form of a huge mass of stapled photocopies in 1998, published in an
edition of 100 by Object and distributed to friends in New York and elsewhere by mail. In
2000, Harry Tankoos Books published another 100 copies, some of which are still available
at Small Press Distribution. Gulf was my second book, a "companion volume" to Free Space
Comix published by Roof earlier that year, but more readily recognizable now as the
precursor for Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics, as it contains the long computer
poem "Stops and Rebels" (a highly alliterative scramble of Tennyson's translation of the
Old English poem "Battle of Brunaburh") and a final essay at the end that uses
search-and-replace techniques to translate it into a supra-terranean brogue. The /ubu
version of Gulf has been reset with new typefaces, and is the same as the original
edition minus 4 poems. "Alpha Betty's Chronicles" appeared at the same time as Gulf on
the ubu.com; I decided to reform it for /ubu since it is much easier to print-out and
read this way, and I always considered it a book, and not necessarily a web, poem.



Low-Level Bureaucratic Structures Principles of the Emeryville Shellmound
Lytle Shaw
38 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/shaw_low.html

These two chapbooks, originally published by Shaw and Emilie Clark's Shark Press, can be
figured somewhere at the nexus of several forces: conceptual writing like that explored
by Vito Acconci and Bernadette Mayer in their short-lived journal 0 to 9 – in which
procedural processes and the very frames of the letter-size page conspires to create a
visual enigma – the naïve word/picture art often associated with Raymond Pettibon, and
the 'pataphysical expository prose of Spiral Jetty creator Robert Smithson, which can
make such subjects as the factory ruins of New Jersey seem of a piece with excavations of
Neolithic artifacts (in fact, Shaw's first book of poetry, Cable Factory 20, was based on
Smithson's work). Other interests peculiar to Shaw, such as Enlightenment concepts of
Bildung (personal mastery), the problematics of canonical "knowledge," not to mention a
sort of goofy humor, animate these two works. Shaw encouraged the degradation of the
image that photocopying incurred in the original publications, a downward spiral that
lends pathos to the projects and which is all the more encouraged with its translation to
reduced digital images.



The Chinese Notebook
Ron Silliman
30 Pages
http://ubu.com/ubu/silliman_chinese.html

The third and final section to appear in /ubu from Silliman's seminal, long out-of-print
book The Age of Huts ("Sunset Debris" and "2197" appeared last year), "The Chinese
Notebook" has become a key text for Language writers, being part manifesto for a
deterritorializing and reference-troubling aesthetics and part meditative and procedural
exercise, forming an important bridge between New American poetics of the "daily" (think
Creeley, Kyger, Ginsberg) and the hardcore constructivism of Language writers like David
Melnick and Barrett Watten. Most distinctly, "The Chinese Notebook" is a poetic
insistence, an act of positioning poetry as more than a tributary of philosophy but
possibly philosophy itself, of form being as troubling a determiner of genre as content
(Wittgenstein's numbered aphoristic works provide the gravity, here), and of the
idiosyncratically-educated West Coast poet being a public intellectual on a national
cultural stage. Written with a characteristic "plain style" and yet daringly expansive,
this poem had the force of both a treatise and an anthem, and counts as one of the most
influential of the Language School.

I love this catalog; reading it is even better than reading wine descriptions.

Hello Friends:

I'm writing to alert you to a number of events in the Bay Area -- San =
Francisco, Berkeley & Davis -- to celebrate my anthology of contemporary =
poetry by Mexican women, Sin puertas visibles. I'd be most delighted to =
see you at any or all of these events (the SF events will be =
significantly different from one another, for those that are real =
gluttons for poetic punishment) & I'd be most grateful if you'd help me =
spread the word.

Please forgive if you've already received this information.

Most best,

Jen

Boyko,
the only time any wine, white or red, smells like gasoline, is when the =
winemakers have failed (I'll avoid the technial explanation, but you =
should know there is one." =20

What ever you are drinking, I suggest you change brands

Also, for US wines, try the Canoe Ridge Gewurtztraminer, 2002.  You =
should find an aroma of spices and white flesh fruites...apples =
primarily, and a nicely acidic wine. =20

Finally, a good, worth drinking Gewrutz is pricey; expect to pay upwards =
of $15.00 a bottle or more.  And the Alsatian and German counterparts =
are $50 to $75.00 a bottle.=20

I never thought about being a Red Sox fan as training for being a writer.
But now that you mention it, it's a spiritual preparation for al the
rejections and near-misses. After they broke my heart last year, for the
47th consecutive year, this time while sitting in South Florida, I found the
Marlins giving me some hope. Maybe Fate is trying to tell me things can
change. But I still want Nomar and Manny to be my bodyguards on my
inevitable book tour. (LOL)

The latest issue of Boston Review -- available in print or online -- has
a couple of essays that might interest Poetics folks.  I've written a
partial state of the art piece, "The People's Poetry" (not my title),
and Marjorie Perloff has an essay-review titled "Pound Ascendant."

I'd be interested to hear responses to the essays.

At a buffalo jump, the Indians would panic a herd of
buffalo into a stampede. Members of the tribe forced
the herd to follow a path that ended a cliff. The
buffalo, now in blind panic, would simply run right
off the edge of the cliff, killing themselves in the
fall. Head-Smashed-In (supposedly) gets its name from
the story of an Indian brave who wished to witness the
plunging buffalo from under the shelter of a ledge
under the cliff. An unusually beautiful day caused the
pile of dead buffalo to reach higher than expected,
crushing the brave against the cliff. When the rest of
the tribe came to butcher the buffalo, they found the
brave with his head smashed in, crushed by the weight
of the buffalo.

i enjoyed hank lazer's fine ~boston review~ piece (and also, marjorie
perloff's astute review of the new pound volumes)...

while i appreciate miekal's perspective on hank's essay,
understanding poetry practice as he does more in terms of larger
d-i-y (international) arts currents and less in terms of academic
professionalization---which hank gestures to as well, for instance,
in his discussion of hip-hop and the like (and which might itself
comprise a gesture toward the entertainment industry)---i think there
may be another way to proceed here...

first, it strikes me that there's a curious silence in hank's text...
i find it odd that 9-11 and  ensuing events make an appearance only
once (right?), in reference to "the many readings against the war in
the run-up to the invasion of Iraq"... i say i find this curious b/c,
while 9-11+ is still admittedly recent history, it's such a
cataclysmic event politically and socially (it's fair to say) that to
characterize it via its capacity for cutting across
mainstream/post-avant norms (or whatever) may be to understate its
capacity for catalyzing social action (symbolic action included)...

which is to say, that i don't believe democratizing or, if you
prefer, balkanization can be said to occur (1) absent, yes, the
institutional power that hank keeps coming back to in his piece via
reference to the publishing and awards apparatus associated with
"official verse culture," OR (2) absent the institutional power grid
associated with the broader social and political sphere... if there
is every reason in the world to OPPOSE a political system (he sez),
and if poets are not lining up (as the evidence suggests, at least in
retrospect, they lined up during vietnam) to oppose same---a system,
mind you, that is clearly Bad News for all but the most populist of
artistic endeavors---why then there's at the very least a potential
lapse that may be less about resisting nostalgia (all due respect for
those who claim that manifestos and movements and the like are rather
beside the point for today's generation(s)) than about a radically
altered public sphere...

and if this public sphere, however we manage to talk about it, has
been radically altered pre-9-11, when then i would want to know if
it's been radically altered again post-9-11... and i would want to
know what's left behind when public spheres are OR are not radically
altered (as i sense a class issue or two at stake in all of this)...

taking just this list of, what, 1000 or so poets/critics as an
example:  an awful lot of material crosses my screen every day,
courtesy of this list, regarding iraq, bush, afghanistan, the
republicans, etc... and if occasionally someone manages to ask, What
has this to do with poetics and poetry? the general acquiescence to
this flood of information suggests to me that many of us of the
post-avant (or whatever), while perhaps feeling inundated with same
(and, uhm, helpless to do anything about it!), nonetheless may very
well see the connection, and we may very well see the connection in
abb (all but bush) terms... to me, something like the realpoetic has
certainly become the realpolitical in these quarters, if only by
default (and i suppose i have to add, apologies to those of you who
plan to vote repub)...

that's item the first, a kind of willful polemical misreading on my
part of hank's piece, and offered w/o at all wishing to polarize
matters...

item the second, which is somewhat easier to get at:

if in fact one of the issues for l=a=n=g over the past three decades
has been the prose-poetry distinction (which, as many of you know,
stephen fredman helpfully takes up in ~poet's prose~), it's
nonetheless the case that commentary on l=a=n=g---indeed, commentary
on poetry in general---is yet marked by a nearly complete silence
regarding prose writers who are both not writing conventional prose
AND who are not considered poets...

note this last bit of obfuscation on my part... my partner here, kass
(fleisher), would argue that this is owing to the fact that sentence
work that doesn't do what conventional sentence work does is
generally published by poetry presses, and treated as POETRY (~the
new sentence~ notwithstanding)... this has (had) the effect of
creating lineages that speak more to the work of poets than to the
work of prose writers, unless one goes back far enough (and the
greater the distance, the more presumably innocuous the comparison)...

so e.g., hank can say of susan howe that her work is "better
understood in relation to "Charles Sanders Peirce (and the American
pragmatists, including Kenneth Burke), Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman
Melville, and Emily Dickinson"---w/o bothering to distinguish howe as
more a poet or more a prose writer *in this regard*, and w/o noting
how this lineage consists of such distinctions (well---emerson and
melville wrote poetry and prose, but you get my point... howe is, for
hank and for most of us, a POET)...

now on the one hand, we can wave our hands over this matter and
simply claim that our aesthetics today have been hybridized,
creolized, etc. (like our ideologies?), and that this is a good
thing, so we needn't worry about genre distinctions that ultimately
have to do more with the marketplace than with any intrinsic formal
distinctions...

on the other hand, though these distinctions may ultimately have to
do with the marketplace, it's rather striking to me how not attending
to this prose-poetry matter more concretely permits us (all of
us---mea cupla) to persist w/o e.g. bothering to discuss how recent
work in poetry may be helpfully aligned with recent work in prose...

(on this note, recall the perennial posts hereabouts inquiring as to
whether there's a list such as this one devoted to prose... in point
of fact, kass ran a list, PROSAICS, for a spell, a list aspiring to
just that, but it became moribund rather quickly due to, to---to
what, exactly, i can't say...)

so, here's a thought:  how about we start to talk about PROSE as a
prose writer might?... i just experienced a nice conjunction of
poets, prose writers, digital artists at notre dame a coupla weeks
back (the &now festival of contemporary literature), and i'm here to
say that we ought to be talking across this divide much more
frequently, and to greater effect... how does contemporary poetry
look when measured against, say, the collective writings of the fc2
folks (and interesting in this regard that leslie scalapino has
proved of late a crossover figure in this regard, with a book out on
fc2)... how does contemporary poetry look when measured against the
prose that dalkey archive has published?... how does contemporary
avant-garde poetry look (assuming there can be such a thing, re which
more later) vis-a-vis contemporary avant-garde prose?... or are we
simply to argue that there is no narrative avant? (or whatever)...

just some quick thoughts on this rainy morning in normal, illinois...
many thanks to hank for sparking same, and to everyone for bearing
with my interpretive insouciance...

best,

joe

also be considering reviews of e-books.

Who else is out there with e-zines that I might talk with? Who is =
linking e-zines and I don't know about it or plans to do this and hasn't =
spoken up? Anyone?

I think it would be helpful to all of us to know what's going on in this =
regard. Keep the ball rolling.
Thanks for the feedback.

Well, it's only partly Hilton - it's his aunt Zosia - and its a both
harrowing and great story:

Running through Fire, How I Survived the Holocaust
By Zosia Goldberg as told to Hilton Obenzinger
with an introduction by Paul Auster
 Mercury House=20

Well reviewed in this past Sundays SF Chronicle - see below:

Why am I flaking this book? - I was the benighted(indeed) character who too=
k
on the job of transcribing the original tapes in 1985 (yes, almost 20 years
to get into full print!) But I can tell you first hand I was never more
rattled by a tape in my life at the same totally engaged with an incredibly
commanding  story teller - the Houdini of the holocaust, I'd speculate.

Hilton tells me there are some theatrical performances happening soon in Ne=
w
York and the Bay Area. If he's reading this, he can flak the details.

Running Through Fire

How I Survived the Holocaust

By Zosia Goldberg, as told to Hilton Obenzinger

MERCURY HOUSE; 188 PAGES; $15.95 PAPERBACK
www.Mercuryhouse.org
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a Holocaust memoir, the question being answered is "how": how I escaped,
how I survived, how I went on. Yet there exists another question that is
equally pressing but impossible to answer. The question is "why." Why did I
survive when the others did not? "Running Through Fire," the memoir of Zosi=
a
Goldberg, bears the subtitle "How I Survived the Holocaust." She rarely ask=
s
why, only pausing on occasion to marvel at the odd mixture of luck and
circumstance that allowed her to live.

When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, Zosia Goldberg was a 21-year-old
urbanite accustomed to a carefree life. "We went out to the nightclubs and
cafes. Life was just tremendous in Warsaw. Everybody lived like it was the
last days of Pompeii." Goldberg was one of a community of assimilated Jews
who, for the most part, were fully integrated into secular society. Her
father, Mieczyslaw Goldberg, was the highest-ranking Jewish civil servant o=
f
his time, highly respected and consistently mistaken for a gentile. Photos
of Zosia show a stunning, cultivated woman who, like her father, was often
taken for a gentile. "With my dark eyes and hair, I never heard that I was =
a
Jew. They called me a Gypsy instead -- admiringly!"

This and the fact that Goldberg spoke Polish without a trace of a Yiddish
accent -- a telltale trait that condemned many Polish Jews -- gave her an
escape route of sorts. Once the fate of the Jews had become clear to her,
Goldberg paid for herself and her mother (who survived the war separately
from her daughter) to be smuggled from the Jewish to the Aryan ghetto. Once
inside, both women assumed gentile identities. On the advice of a friend,
Zosia got herself arrested so that she would be sent, along with the other
young Poles, to Germany's forced-labor camps. There she posed as a
Polish-Ukrainian orphan, hiding her Jewish identity until the end of the
war.=20

From the ghetto to the labor camps, it is virtually impossible to count the
number of times Goldberg could have been killed. It is equally difficult to
say how she escaped death each one of those times. Certainly, she was
extremely lucky and possessed of bravery that bordered on recklessness. But
she also understood human nature. Goldberg had an uncanny ability to
instantly read people and situations and knew how to position herself in
order to maximize her chances of survival. She recalls a brutal
interrogation by the overseer of a Nazi labor camp. " 'You are not Polish!
Who are you?' He beat me without stopping. ... All of a sudden, I reminded
myself of what the Gentile engineer had advised me: Never admit anything if
they beat you. As a matter of fact, if a German beats you up and you don't
fight back, that means that you are Jew, that you are scared. A Gentile
always strikes back."

Goldberg's acute self-awareness extended to her charms, which played a
softer yet vital role in her survival. As a young woman, Goldberg was never
naive or coquettish, but fully aware of her appeal and the power it afforde=
d
her. She explains early on, "I was beautiful and very young. So wherever I
went they were always opening doors for me. I had this kind of luck.
Wherever I went, I found help."

Goldberg's extraordinary story is made all the more powerful by her
matter-of-fact delivery. "Running Through Fire" is an oral history, arguabl=
y
the memoir in its purest form. The text is transcribed from several
conversations between the subject and her nephew, the poet, critic and
novelist Hilton Obenzinger, who initiated the project for the purpose of
preserving his family history. (Later he was encouraged to pursue
publication for a broader audience.) Obenzinger takes an unusual approach i=
n
chronicling his aunt's story. Rather than including his observations as the
interviewer in this testimony -- descriptions of Goldberg's storytelling
manner, the multiple questions that surely saturate the original tape -- he
leaves himself out of the text entirely. The book reads as one continuous,
unprompted monologue. Obenzinger notes in the preface, "I prodded some, but
once she began to talk the problem was rarely faulty memory, but a rush of
details, the confluence of so many sub-plots with the immensity of the
brutality, ugliness, pain."

In the context of the Holocaust memoir, the unvarnished expository style of
oral history has particular impact. Goldberg's story is immediate and
relentless. From beginning to end, one horror is layered atop another with
none of the opportunities for narrative buffers that a written memoir
permits. She describes the Warsaw ghetto: "There were cadavers all over,
their skin bursting open. They looked like lepers. They were covered with
papers, smelling. Rats were eating them." The unmitigated, "real time"
aspect of the transcribed testimonial gives Goldberg's story an artless
veracity. The unique, unforgettable power that it imparts to her story, and
to all stories of survival, is particularly important now that the public i=
s
said to tire of hearing yet another Holocaust tale. =80

Oh give me a break all you Sox fans who have to
suffer through a perenially contending team
playing in the most beautiful stadium in all of
sports. you have it so tough. When was the last
time the Sox were bad enough to lose 119 games,
like my Detroit boys last year? my favorite
team...

1984 Tigers. I was 14 years old, the Tigers
started 35-5 (and were a more or less .500 team
the rest of the way but still ran away with it), I
had my first real kiss (Danielle Boyajian), Purple
Rain came out, and the Tigers blew away the Pads
in the World Series.

the last time I spoke to Swedenborg
he said that in Heaven I'm represented
by what appears to be
the dental X-ray of a prehistoric beast,
which is pretty neat if you like
dental X-rays of prehistoric beasts
I totally forgot to ask him if "Jeff,
you're represented by..." meant
the dental X-ray is my agent of
some sort, or if that's what I'm
going to look like, because Emanuel
always gets his times mixed up (as bad
as a kid learning multiplication tables)
maybe by "prehistoric" he meant that's
what I used to look like at one time
and that's what I look like eternally
I always read a lot into my conversations
with Swedenborg, I'm still shy around
him, I guess, starstruck or something,
he never seems that way around me,
which I must chalk up to enlightenment

But your team DID win a World Series in your lifetime. How many homers
would Ted Williams have hit in Briggs Stadium? Right field in Fenway
didn't help him, although Fenway overall is one of the best hitters'
parks in baseball. The Sox might not have lost 119 games, but they were only
slightly better than mediocre in the 50's and didn't have that many great
years in the 60's. I've read reports the Tigers are doing a lot better this
year because of the free agents they signed. I'd prefer Pudge over
Varitek, good as he is. The problem we Sox fans have is living with our high
expectations and the inevitable letdowns.

Fair enough Vern. I have many Sox fan friends and
they assure me that the fact the Sox almost always
contend -- which they have done with remarkable
consistency during my lifetime -- only makes the
inevitable suffering that much more painful. The
Tigers gave me one golden year in the flower of my
youth, then promptly gave away John Smoltz (and
drove off almost every member of that great team)
dooming us to almost two decades of ignominy and
ineptitude. there's lots of ways your team can
stick it to you and twist it. it's nice having
pudge, but at this point in his career they'll be
lucky to get three good years out of him.
varitek's no slouch.

best,

But your team DID win a World Series in your
lifetime. How many homers
would Ted Williams have hit in Briggs Stadium?
Right field in Fenway
didn't help him, although Fenway overall is one of
the best hitters'
parks in baseball. The Sox might not have lost 119
games, but they were only
slightly better than mediocre in the 50's and
didn't have that many great
years in the 60's. I've read reports the Tigers
are doing a lot better this
year because of the free agents they signed. I'd
prefer Pudge over
Varitek, good as he is. The problem we Sox fans
have is living with our high
expectations and the inevitable letdowns.

Oh give me a break all you Sox fans who have to
suffer through a perenially contending team
playing in the most beautiful stadium in all of
sports. you have it so tough. When was the last
time the Sox were bad enough to lose 119 games,
like my Detroit boys last year? my favorite
team...

1984 Tigers. I was 14 years old, the Tigers
started 35-5 (and were a more or less .500 team
the rest of the way but still ran away with it), I
had my first real kiss (Danielle Boyajian), Purple
Rain came out, and the Tigers blew away the Pads
in the World Series.

I never thought about being a Red Sox fan as
training for being a writer.
But now that you mention it, it's a spiritual
preparation for al the
rejections and near-misses. After they broke my
heart last year, for the
47th consecutive year, this time while sitting in
South Florida, I found the
Marlins giving me some hope. Maybe Fate is trying
to tell me things can
change. But I still want Nomar and Manny to be my
bodyguards on my
inevitable book tour. (LOL)

The Poetry of Bertolt Brecht

with Michael Hofmann, Anselm Hollo, Geoffrey O'Brien & Sonia Sanchez
Thursday, April 22, 7pm $7, Free for Members

Four poets gather to speak on the poetry of Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956).
A ground-breaking playwright and committed Marxist, Brecht expanded the
boundaries of verse by combining biting political satire with such
diverse influences as the 16th-century ballad, popular song and the
writings of Rudyard Kipling.

Michael Hofmann is the author of five books of poems, a book of essays,
and a translator from the German (Roth, Kafka, Koeppen and others). His
version of The Good Person of Sichuan by Brecht ran at the National
Theatre in London in 1990. He has edited an anthology of German
20th-century poetry for Faber, which appears later this year.

Anselm Hollo, poet and literary translator, is a Professor in the Jack
Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder,
Colorado. Hollo has published more than thirty-five books and chapbooks
of his poetry. His most recent book is Notes on the Possibilities and
Attractions of Existence: Selected Poems 1965-2000.

Geoffrey O'Brien's poetry has been collected most recently in A View of
Buildings and Water. He has also published prose books, including Sonata
for Jukebox, The Browser's Ecstasy, The Phantom Empire, and Dream Time.
He is editor-in-chief of The Library of America.

Sonia Sanchez is the author of over a dozen books of poetry, including
Shake Loose My Skin: New and Selected Poems, Like the Singing Coming Off
the Drums: Love Poems and Homegirls and Handgrenades. She has also
published numerous plays, essays and children's books. She held the
Laura Carnell Chair in English at Temple University until her retirement
in 1999.

MIME-Version: 1.0

President Bush was here today.  Interesting angle:  He sat on stage with
four or five other (all) men, each of whom spoke extemporaneously,
well-prepared, but without notes.  Bush maintained a close relationship
with a music stand which held his notes.  Even so, he lost his place a
few times.  The mayor of Buffalo did not attend, citing "philosophical
differences" involving sending jobs overseas, and afterwards some of the
"uniforms," who attended to provide good photo background, commented to
local TV reporters that they would like to receive the Homeland Security
funds owed since 2002 to this part of the country.  (Maybe they'd like
some reimbursement for today's security costs, too.)  Protesters outside
the building where the show was held got more coverage on at least one
major station than the President.  Maybe it was because they had more to
say:  many of them were union members, mostly middle-aged, mostly men.
They were allowed a place within earshot of the President.

I especially liked Bush's imitation of Johnny Carson -- the right-hand
chop that Carson used when enthusiastic applause cut too deeply into his
monolog time.

I was surprised -- tho' perhaps should not have been -- that huge images
of the World Trade Center fires and the bombing of Baghdad were flashed
at length on a giant screen.  Behind the men on the stage:  large
photographs of grimy firemen and other uniformed personnel at Ground Zero
-- a truly exploitive and even cynical co-option of tragedy in the
furtherance of a political career.  Bush stood before these terrible
images and declared "We didn't know. . . " etc.

It was a tough day for truthtelling.  Thought some of you might like to
know.

I was in the crowd of protesters.  (As were several other Poetics people,
familiar to this list: Chris Alexander, Tim Shaner, Barbara Cole, Sarah
Campbell, Michael Rozendal, Sasha Steensen, Damian Weber . . .)  Perhaps we
were within earshot, but pretty much out of sight.  Not that we had an
inconspicuous location-- right on the traffic circle in front of the music
hall where Bush spoke-- but Bush and his retinue took the back entrance.
Not only that, the detail then made sure to turn all the cars around back
into the tented entrance the other way, so that Bush wouldn't have to drive
by the protesters on exiting.  The irony is that this maneuver mostly forced
Bush to approach Kleinhan's Music Hall via the slummy nieghborhood that
adjoins it to the west, rather than the more stately avenues on the East
side.  Let's just call him a "back door man."

The NY Times reported "100 protesters."  For the record, there were at least
four or five times that many, perhaps more . . .

And a refreshing mix.  My favorite was the couple dressed as millionaires
(complete with tuxes and cigar) carrying signs saying "Free the Enron 7,"
and "Millionaires for Bush."  And the Buffalo Bills Beer Santa.  And the
"Sabres fans united against Bush," slamming hockey pucks past a lame goalie
wearing a Bush face.  And the UB Professor with the flourescent sign
brandishing one, cut and dried word: KILLER.

in the American arsenal

Moscow's SS-N-22 "Sunburn" sales to China

the habitual concept, redrawing
of frontiers and fall of regimes
from the Adriatic to the borders of China

the "joint precision interdiction" concept

the Maastricht treaty

the obstinacy with which it attaches itself
to the arbitrary opposition

those were the issues in the bitter clashes
of that distant time

the colorist saw space and light: glare
to appease, apprise, pry

immense encompassing untold

engulfed

can it ever designate anything other than

(mind the limits of that space)

Why does the meaning shift between behold
and beholden

unbolted


But he had not thought that the streets would not be gone. That the
sky here is the same sky as the one that proved so empty for them. See
what happens? By then the words had become just words, and there was
nothing that might be said or done that could alter the perception and
shift it towards the conditional: what could have been, having been
left only with what had been, and all around the conventional
definition: The event could not be viewed. All the categories appeared
to have come apart, so that an author might write: Consciousness is
deformed by the nation-state, and no one could remember the
traditional polarity, though any number of equally traditional
representations persist, returning us to the century we wished to be
done with, done away as transitional to the time and place believed to
be the present for the writing that knows where it is and where they
are, situated in a universe of malignity where everyone is wronged.

"Karl Kraus's admonition to step forward and be silent perhaps steeled
Loos in his refusal to represent the social and political disaster
that was fin de siecle Vienna. A certain asceticism attends this
refusal, implicit always in the mute interventions into the
traditional city (not exactly like ripping out your tongue in the
public square). Loos's strategy maintained the choice of refusal which
was perhaps the only choice left to make. Aldo van Eyck's dilemma 'if
society has no form how can architects build the counterform?'
(Smithson, 1968, p. 13), is echoed by Aldo Rossi's remark 'I am proud
that I have not often built for people when I did not know where they
were' (Rossi, 1981, p. 48). These are all statements of a radical
political will, not aesthetic evasions." (Pope, 1996, p. 235).


In the fields they say you break your back.
Backwards, in that regard.

What is the view of the war that is - always - there.
Should there be anything else to say other than - after
the hand-eye movement necessary to the act of sighting.

in the same vein as the oulippian task of creating a poem that will
drive one's pet wild by repeating the pet's name, I wrote a poem to
torment my parrot by repeating the sound of the name of his favorite
food, "rice" --

is this the sort of think the atlanta pets group is up to as well?

Emancipating Pragmatism
Emerson, Jazz, and Experimental Writing
Michael Magee

A daring and innovative study that rewrites the story of American
pragmatism.

This book traces Emerson's philosophical legacy through the 19th and
20th centuries to discover how Emersonian thought continues to inform
issues of race, aesthetics, and poetic discourse. Magee examines the
ties between pragmatism and African-American culture as they manifest
themselves in key texts and movements, such as William Carlos Williams's
poetry; Ralph Ellison's discourse in Invisible Man and Juneteenth and
his essays on jazz; the poetic works of Robert Creeley, Amiri Baraka,
and Frank O'Hara; as well as the "new jazz" being forged at clubs like
The Five Spot in New York. Ultimately, Magee calls into question
traditional maps of pragmatist lineage and ties pragmatism to the
avant-garde American tradition.

*Co-winner of the 2003 Elizabeth Agee Manuscript Prize from The
University of Alabama Press


"Nowhere else, that I am aware of, can one read such an apt commingling
of Emerson and Ellison, jazz and writing, Williams, Stein, Baraka, and
O'Hara. . . . [Emancipating Pragmatism] is a remarkable synthesis of
these figures who have been the subjects of disparate studies before,
but whose linkages through philosophical approaches to pragmatism have
never been so carefully examined in parallel."

Postmodernism

A little programme on the BBC World Service this night was focused on the
problems of containing avian flu in Hong Kong. It was gruesome stuff, but
thank G-d I don't happen to be a chicken, well, not literally, but at one
point a speaker instead of saying 'poultry' recommended the 'eradication of
all poetry', in HK of course. In my bad moods I can agree with that
worldwide.

Transfeminism: Let Her Rip
By Hanne Blank
It’s been in the New York Times, so it must be official: Transpeople
are here in number and they’re here to stay. Transsexuals (those who
medically change the hormonal and/or anatomical aspects of their
biological sex) and transgendered people (those who change or redefine
their gender that may not include any medical change) are, as
illuminated in the March 7 Times article “On Campus, Rethinking Biology
101,” increasingly visible and vocal, and they’re out there doing
shocking, subversive things—like going to college and working for
appropriate living conditions on their campuses. These efforts bring up
any number of issues about equal access, but also about the nature and
meaning of personal attributes we’re taught to think of as fixed and
immutable, like sex and gender.

Trans may only now be gracing the pages of the Times, but it’s been an
issue among feminists for years. From the long-running controversy over
admitting only “womyn-born-womyn” to the nearly 30-year-old Michigan
Womyn’s Music Festival, to whether the lesbian community is losing its
butch women to transsexuality, transfolk are forcing feminism to face
difficult, sometimes uncomfortable, questions.

Such questions are not only about trans people, although they’re often
framed that way. They’re questions about the nature of feminism, about
essentialism and binarism and how we should challenge oppressive
ideologies of gender. The question is raised, in some quarters, of
whether trans issues belong in feminism at all. Isn’t it hard enough
for feminists to create change without being asked to take on the cause
of people who are something other than biological women?

Here’s an attempt at an answer: Feminism has been fighting for
generations against the notion that biology equals destiny. Do we
really believe it? Or are we still clinging to a mythos that insists
there’s some numinous ontological essence called “man-ness” or
“woman-ness”? Transfolk, increasingly numerous, loud and proud, are
calling our bluff.

Our apartment was broken into today. Electronics were taken from the apartment when no one was home.

But at least they left the poetry.

So, what can we conclude?

Poetry, folks, cannot be taken away from us.

How about that?

Next time you put a down payment on yr home FORGET about putting "My Life" or "A" up for collateral!

Lock yr doors, close yr mind: it's time for the two minute warning.

Chris

Giorgio Agamben:
“The lesson that Baudelaire bequeathed to modern
poetry is that the only way to go beyond the commodity
was to press its contradictions to the limit, to the
point at which the commodity as such would be
abolished and the object as such would be restored to
its own truth. As sacrifice restores to the sacred
sphere what servile use has degraded and profaned, so,
through poetic transfiguration, the object is pulled
away both from the enjoyment of its use and from its
value as accumulation, and is restored to its original
status. For this reason Baudelaire saw a great analogy
between poetic activity and sacrafice, between “the
man that sings” and “the man that sacrifices,” and he
planned the composition of a “theory of sacrafice” of
which the notes in **Fusees** are but fragments. As it
is only through destruction that sacrifice
consecrates, so it is only through the estrangement
that makes it unattainable, and through the
dissolution of traditional intelligibility and
authority, that the falsehood of the commodity is
changed into truth. This the sense of “art for art’s
sake,” which means not the **enjoyment** of art for
its own sake, but the **destruction** of art worked by
art.”


Three Objections:
I.

Ill-defined matter may carry a load of prose like a
ship. But a perfect economy is a machine which drives
poetry, pruned to it. As in all machines, it’s
intrinsic, a physical movement is undulant, a more
than literary character.

II.
A machine may carry a load of poetry ill-defined. But
a perfect economy is like a prose ship which is
undulant, drives to it. As in all machines, its
intrinsic movement, a pruned literary character,  a
more than physical matter.

III.

More than a load of perfect machines prose poetry may
carry a ship which is undulant-ill-defined. But
literary economy drives physical matter pruned to it.
As in all movement, its  machine character is
intrinsic  like  a, a, a, a.

for those of you in the Philadelphia area, this is a remarkable interview=20
with a incredible woman, not to be missed!

Senator John Kerry claims that Chavez and his cabinet are evil dictators. =20
and of course Bush and his entire family agree, considering the oil money=20
involved.

it's sad to say that Venezuela has NO FRIEND in the White House, no matter=20
who wins the election later this year.
-------------
Tune in and tell your friends!
We wanted to let you know that an interview of Nora Casta=F1eda, President o=
f
the Women's Development Bank of Venezuela, will be airing on DUTV (cable
channel 54 in Philadelphia) tomorrow (Thursday, April 22) at 8pm and
Midnight, on the "From the Left" program.

As you know, the Global Women's Strike coordinated Ms. Casta=F1eda's very
successful 6-city US tour in February on "Creating a Caring Economy in
Venezuela". Ms. Casta=F1eda spoke to large and enthusiastic crowds and to ma=
ny
standing ovations at public meetings in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago,
Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York City. The DUTV program will get the
message out to thousands more.

Also, see the Global Women's Strike webpage for photos from Ms. Casta=F1eda'=
s
tour:

"Micro credit is an excuse to empower women. We believe that the economy
must be at the service of human beings, not human beings at the service of
the economy. We want to create an economy based on cooperation and mutual
support, a caring economy. We are not building a bank. We are building a
different way of life."
"We women won our rights in the constitution. We won Article 88, which
recognizes that housewives create added value and must be compensated with
social security." - Nora Casta=F1eda

>
> Twenty-six authors will participate in "Operation Homecoming," which Gioia

> $300,000, with $250,000 donated from Boeing, Inc., a leading defense

that submissions will be based on artistic merit, not on whether they're pro-
or anti-war.
>

>
> ...........
> "We have the best educated and best trained military in American history.
I can't believe that there isn't considerable artistic talent among this
huge number of people," Gioia said.

>
>
> Arlington, Va. - U.S. troops returning from duty will be encouraged to
> write about their wartime experiences through a new National Endowment for
> the Arts (NEA) program, called Operation Homecoming. NEA Chairman Dana
> Gioia announced the initiative in a news conference today at the Women in
> Military Service for America Memorial in Arlington, Va.
>
> The program will provide writing workshops led by distinguished authors
> such as Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down; Tom Clancy, author of The
> Hunt for Red October; Bobbie Ann Mason, author of In Country; and James
> McBride, author of The Color of Water. Operation Homecoming will also

> Arts Federation, and is made possible by The Boeing Company.
>
> "Operation Homecoming will preserve personal accounts of the wartime
> experiences of our troops and their loved ones," said NEA Chairman Dana
> Gioia. "Some of these writings will focus on a singularly challenging
> moment in life, while others may provide vivid accounts of historical

> richer for their addition."
>
> The workshops led by two-person teams of writers, many of them veterans
> themselves, will be hosted by at least eight military installations around
> the country and overseas. The Operation Homecoming anthology will collect
> the stories and reflections of the returning troops in a variety of
forms -
> from fiction, verse, and letters to essay, memoir, and personal journals.
>
> "As a part of Operation Homecoming our soldiers, sailors, airmen and
> Marines will have the opportunity to write about some of their wartime
> experiences in a manner that will be both therapeutic and creative," said
> Charles S. Abell, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for
Personnel
> and Readiness. "By reflecting on and documenting their recent experiences,
> participants will gain new insights by working with a number of renowned
> authors, and in the process will be writing works of genuine historical
> value."
>
> Workshops will be held for Marines at Camp Lejeune, N.C. and Camp
> Pendleton, Calif.; for Army soldiers at Fort Drum, N.Y. and Fort
> Richardson, Alaska; for Air Force airmen at Hurlburt Field, Fla.; and for
> Navy sailors at Norfolk, Va. and San Diego, Calif.
>

> peace around the world," said Jim Albaugh, president and chief executive
> officer, Boeing Integrated Defense Systems. "Their wartime experiences -
as
> conveyed in their own words - will be a powerful portrayal of commitment,

for
> generations to come."
>
> To provide inspiration and guidance, the NEA is distributing an Operation
> Homecoming CD containing interviews and readings by well-known writers who

Doctors Could Refuse To Treat Gays

(Lansing, Michigan)=A0 Doctors or other health care providers could not =20=

be disciplined or sued if they refuse to treat gay patients under =20
legislation passed Wednesday by the Michigan House.

The bill allows health care workers to refuse service to anyone on =20
moral, ethical or religious grounds.

The Republican dominated House passed the measure as dozens of =20
Catholics looked on from the gallery. The Michigan Catholic Conference, =20=

which pushed for the bills, hosted a legislative day for Catholics on =20=

Wednesday at the state Capitol.

The bills now go the Senate, which also is controlled by Republicans.

The Conscientious Objector Policy Act would allow health care providers =20=

to assert their objection within 24 hours of when they receive notice =20=

of a patient or procedure with which they don't agree. However, it =20
would prohibit emergency treatment to be refused.

Three other three bills that could affect LGBT health care were also =20
passed by the House Wednesday which would exempt a health insurer or =20
health facility from providing or covering a health care procedure that =20=

violated ethical, moral or religious principles reflected in their =20
bylaws or mission statement.

Opponents of the bills said they're worried they would allow providers =20=

to refuse service for any reason. For example, they said an emergency =20=

medical technicians could refuse to answer a call from the residence of =20=

gay couple because they don't approve of homosexuality.

Rep. Chris Kolb (D-Ann Arbor) the first openly gay legislator in =20
Michigan, pointed out that while the legislation prohibits racial =20
discrimination by health care providers, it doesn't ban discrimination =20=

based on a person's sexual orientation.

"Are you telling me that a health care provider can deny me medical =20
treatment because of my sexual orientation? I hope not," he said.

"I think it's a terrible slippery slope upon which we embark," said =20
Rep. Jack Minore (D-Flint) before voting against the bill.

Paul A. Long, vice president for public policy for the Michigan =20
Catholic Conference, said the bills promote the constitutional right to =20=

religious freedom.

"Individual and institutional health care providers can and should =20
maintain their mission and their services without compromising =20
faith-based teaching," he said in a written statement.

uh, there is a lot of source about Toklas' relationship with um, her
favorite fashion designer on his side -- I am forgetting right now -- it
is still am for me -- dunno how "exotic" couture is, tho

don't forget the Baroness!  while there's a lot of info out there on her
use of fashion, the book I just reviewed, Irrational Modernism:  New

Just an intuition here, Maria, but I suspect histories of Lady Victorian
Travelers may provide a source of influence(s) here. I think several were
noted for taking on the garb of "the other" as a means to x, y, & z.

Poetics List:

A strange new book by Ben Friedlander, Simulcast, in the MCP Series,
with a discount offer to the Poetics List. Please back channel me if you
are interested in reviewing this new book.

Hank Lazer

*

Mr. Friedlander's Simulcast is not at all a nice book. It is, however,
an intelligent, wickedly funny, and above all, strikingly original book.
The central problem it grapples with -- "... [T]he public is desirous
only of poets, not poetry" (Poe) -- is one most critics and poets have
refused to touch. What should writing do about this unfortunate
situation? Pretend it is not true? Hope it goes away? Rather than deny,
moralize, or simply ignore our sordid fascination with "the most readily
idealized public personnae," or maintain that this social phenomenon
could not possibly have any bearing on the hallowed clearing of
Literature-In-Itself, Mr. Friedlander dives headlong into the muck, much
like Mr. Poe, Mr. Dryden, and Ms. McCarthy before him, in order to
diagnose its various symptoms. What makes Mr. Friedlander's contribution
different is his counterintuitive use of a formal question -- one that
goes straight to the heart of the Author as Problem -- to disclose and
interpret the sociological one. Throughout Simulcast, the two halves of
this false divide are continually brought into conversation: How does
the fact that the avant-garde is a social formation (one generated by
ListServes, reading series, publications, talks) bear on its aesthetic
strategies? More interestingly, how can the avant-garde's textual
practices (primarily those of theft, collage, and palimpsestic writing)
illuminate its status as a social formation? Simulcast is an
unprecedented demonstration that aesthetic innovation itself can be used
to produce something that has been badly needed for some time: a poetic
sociology of the contemporary avant-garde. -- Sianne Ngai

Simulcast
Four Experiments in Criticism
Benjamin Friedlander

Simulcast is an incisive overview of avant-garde American poetry of the
past 25 years. It offers, in the form of four long essays, a highly
opinionated and penetrating examination of a flourishing movement in
American letters by one of its most astute practitioners.
These essays are important critical studies of an evolving poetic genre,
but they also represent an evolution in criticism itself. Friedlander's
unorthodox methodology creates a critical text by adopting and co-opting
the language of significant essays by earlier writers whose subjects and
approaches serve as fitting models, e.g., Jean Wahl's A Short History of
Existentialism and Edgar Allen Poe's "Literati of New York City." The
resulting critiques are themselves a kind of poetry. They explore the
issues of style versus substance, artifice versus authen-ticity, and
plausibility versus truth, while subverting the hierarchy of values
traditionally held in criticism.

"This is a very smart, very provocative book."
--Bob Perelman, University of Pennsylvania

Benjamin Friedlander is Assistant Professor of English at the University
of Maine and author of A Knot Is Not a Tangle and Time Rations.

"Ira Cohen is a world-travelling poet, photographer, filmmaker, shaman and
self-described 'literary hustler' who has been turning out work in all these
fields for over twenty years. His mylar photos were printed in Life and
Avant-Garde in the sixties. The Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda, his wildly
psychedelic film odyssey, an underground classic. Editor of such
groundbreaking international literary publications as Gnaoua and The Great
Society during the sixties; Cohen writes poetry which reflects an incisive
mind and cinematic eye, a surreal imagination, a relentless sense of humor
and a religious obsession with eroticism and death. His poems published in
various chapbooks and literary magazines over the past fifteen years have
been gathered with some of his unpublished writing into a single edition of
selected poems, On Feet of Gold, where his work can begin to be seen as a
whole."

aside from my own scribblings, it's really worth reading through...
the way this worked was that we were each provided (by joan) with a
set of (the same) questions, to which we each responded in toto... so
perhaps less of a roundtable at this point than an archive, as we saw
one another's responses only after they were all posted... perhaps,
if there's a second round, things will become more dialogic...

so ok, the link:

Michael Gottlieb will be reading at the Boston Athenaeum in its Book Talk
series on Thursday, April 29 at 12 noon.


The author of more than a dozen titles, MICHAEL GOTTLIEB's new book, LOST
AND FOUND (Segue), has just been published.  His other recent books include
GORGEOUS PLUNGE (also from Segue) CAREERING OBLOQUY (Other
Publications/Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs), and MORE THAN ALL (Tongue To
Boot), a collaboration with Ted Greenwald.

One of the central first-generation Language poets, Gottlieb helped edit the
seminal "Roof" magazine through the 80s.  He presently lives in Northwest
Connecticut with his wife and two children.

Of his new book, Ron Silliman has written, "LOST AND FOUND is a
read-this-and-change-your-life experience: the first great work to emerge
from the trauma of September 11. Michael Gottlieb's masterwork is one
terrific book."

The Boston Athenaeum is located at 10 1/2 Beacon Street, Boston.

I agree with you, kari.  My mother, a primary care physician ran her own =
office, refused to join an HMO and said she got very tired of insurance =
companies telling her how to practice medicine.  She stopped encouraging =
high school and college student to study medicine.  She said the face nd =
practice of medicine had changed too radically for her to recommend it =
as a profession to anyone.  It was no longer about healing and helping =
but rather about cost management.

/ubu Editons :: Spring 2004 Titles
http://ubu.com/ubu
--------------------------------------

This year's titles range from the visually sophisticated Concrete poetry of
Gustave Morin, a native of Windsor who spent 10 years on his "novel" A Penny
Dreadful, to an obscure volume of satirical translations of Baudelaire by
the English poet Nicholas Moore, from the experiments in frame and format
that Caroline Bergvall and designer Marit Meunzberg explore in their daring
resetting of the poet's Eclat, to the equally daring, if entirely
unscrupulous, logorrhea that is the 130 pages of another "novel," Name, by
Toadex Hobogrammathon.

The big news this year might be the introduction of color into the pantheon
of effects being used in our e-books: both Bergvall's Eclat and my own Alpha
Betty's Chronicles rely heavily on it, in ways that would have been
unsuitable to html and impossibly expensive to print in a book. Likewise,
the volumes by Morin and Lytle Shaw - two of his uniquely low-tech Shark
chapbooks - are primarily graphic works, while the titles by Craig Dworkin,
Robert Fitterman and Larry Price attempt to re-conceptualize the page of an
Adobe Acrobat file as a middle-space that ironizes the permanence of type
(Dworkin's use of Courier fonts) or digital flow (Fitterman's box-like
containers) as well as the "writing on the wall" soixante-huitard-style
(Price's poster-style typography).

Of the republications, we are happy to present the final section of Ron
Silliman's The Age of Huts, The Chinese Notebook, probably the most
influential of his early books outside of Kejtak, two small works by the
increasingly-prized Jean Day, whose 1998 Atelos volume, The Literal World,
woke so many up to her understated talents. Robert Kelly's quasi-fiction -
yes, yet another "novel" - called The Cruise of the Pnyx has long been one
of my favorites of his, but has never appeared in another book, nor has the
original Station Hill edition of 1979 been republished.

New writers include the playwright Madelyn Kent, whose Shufu plays - part
Butoh, part Richard Maxwell-like deadpan, with a touch of Clark Coolidge --
are bound to become recognized as innovative theater, and Aaron Kunin, who
is becoming known in New York and elsewhere as a writer of uncommon
intelligence and tremendous technical precision. The English poet Ira
Lightman drops in on the series like a lightning bolt, spreading his art in
a sort of spirit of personal renaissance, while Barbara Cole's Foxy Moron -
a text I see as existing somewhere between poetry and drama if only because
she reads it so well in public - strikes a little lower, not so much toward
"renaissance" as sexual catharsis, over and over again.

Lastly, we are especially happy to have Deanna Ferguson's long-awaited
follow-up collection to her 1993 book The Relative Minor (which appears as a
reprint in last year's series). Several of the poems in Rough Bush have
already played parts in some of the signal poetics statements of the
nineties; it's good to finally have such a stash of Ferguson's recent
writings in one place.

Enjoy!

I have had the same experience as Solana's mother -- but in psychology.
Our profession was attacked by HMO's before they attacked the MD's.
While we had some early victories, the costs to the HMOs became "a cost
of doing business," and eventually they prevailed.  I quit.  I write full
time.  I am much happier -- and the envy of my colleagues who cannot
afford to quit due to putting children through college and paying
mortgages. . .  The only problem I have is -- I cannot find a decent
primary care doctor for love or money, because, like Solana's mother, so
many have quit.  Eventually, something will have to change.  I hope we
don't all die of curable diseases before that happens.  And obviously, I
would not set a standard for the docs that I refused to set for myself:
of course, they should have the right to quit rather than see their
ability to practice go down the drain along with the ethical compromises
imposed by HMO beancounters.

So much for the lecture.

Curmudgeonly yours,
Martha

ahem, soccer and basketball, considered globally, are more important than
baseball.  of course i grew up in north carolina and went to chapel hill,
so to me nothing is more important than basketball.

A LETTER REGARDING ST. MARK=B9S CHURCH

Dear Friend of St. Mark=B9s:

For over 200 years St. Mark=B9s in-the-Bowery has stood as a monument to the
continuity of great spiritual and social movements. Presently the church=B9s
historic landmark building is at risk. Nearly 25 twenty years have elapsed
since it was last repaired after the fire that almost destroyed it
altogether. It was miraculously spared. Now time and the extraordinary use
of our space have taken their toll. In addition to weekly services and
events involving our congregation, we host three resident arts projects:
Danspace, The St. Mark=B9s Poetry Project and the Ontological Theater.

The church=B9s roof is the most urgent repair necessary. Frequent and
increasingly copious leaks threaten our ability to carry out activities in =
a
normal fashion. Recently, we received a $16,000 grant toward the $50,000 we
must raise to fix the roof. We need another $35,000 to complete that work.

We are holding a FIX-THE-ROOF Event, featuring popular actor and comedian
Rev. Billy (Bill Talen) and the Stop Shopping Choir, on May 9th at 8 PM her=
e
at St. Mark=B9s Church in-the-Bowery, 2nd Avenue and Tenth Street.

Please help St. Mark=B9s reach this all-important goal by making a
contribution, either at the event or by sending a check in mail. Thank you
for your consideration. For more information email: stmarksitb@ aol.com or
call (212) 674-6377.

Faithfully,

The Rev. Julio O. Torres
Priest-in-Charge

Subject:      Re: exchange on the status of contemporary poetry (Kent Johnson
              for.  .  . )
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

From the above:

Kent Johnson:
An American poetic avant-garde? If, as Peter Burger
argues in his classic Theory of the Avant-Garde, the
concept should be understood as defining a collective,
self-conscious, and insistent attack on the
“institution of art and literature” with the aim of
reintegrating art “into the practice of life,” then it
would be hard to find evidence of an “avant-garde”
meriting of the title today. In Burger's view, one
with which it's hard to argue, the historical
avant-garde, in its poetic and visual genres, failed
in rather spectacularly evident ways, its artistic
products reintegrated with great velocity not into
“the practice of life” but into the institutional
“practices” of the very culture it set out to assault.
Although Burger's ideas are seldom cited by
contemporary poets and critics, I think his study
holds some important lessons relevant to the current
situation of American “innovative” poetry. Some of
what follows, then, has his thesis on the fate of
radical modernism as backdrop.
Of course, more than any other literary current of the
past quarter century, Language poetry (or more
broadly, now, as the intra-generational term goes, the
“post-avant”) has been associated with the idea of the
“avant-garde.” In its formative stages, when a dogged
development of autonomous networks was in organic
relation to an intense phase of iconoclastic
critical/poetic activity (i.e., a phase peaking,
perhaps, around the mid-80's), it had a credible claim
to the term. But save for occasional nods to the
original passions, the radical ideals have been
largely shed, and it's now clear, to increasing
numbers of observers, that this current, in repetition
of the process of earlier movements from which its
praxis had importantly been drawn, is effectively
absorbed into the larger literary culture it once
claimed to reject. Language poetry, along with its
various second-generation satellite formations, now
stands as an experimentalist, but respectful and
loyal, opposition within the Parliament of Academic
poetry. The “post-avant” is the mode that ambitious
young MFA'ers study; it is the creative writing
“style” scores of publishers are seeking; it is the
aesthetic pedigree rising numbers of awards are
prizing; it is the criticism and theory that
prestigious university presses are publishing; it is
the “subversive poetics” the current President of the
Modern Language Association has made her reputation
promoting.
In his study, Burger also deals at length (as any
consideration of the avant-garde can't help but do)
with the aesthetic theory of Theodor Adorno, arguing
that the difficult formal practices the latter
championed for their defiant “autonomy” were destined,
by virtue of their tacit collusion with the underlying
“productive and distributive” functions of high
culture, to be institutionally domesticated and
ideologically contained. It's quite interesting in
this regard, if in the sense of dramatic irony, that
the dominant pose of current post-avant cultural
politics has come to affect a quasi-Adornean air,
inasmuch as its poets not only militantly privilege
avant-gardist forms over realist ones in practice
(i.e., experimental forms proposed as historically
necessary gestures of negation in commodity-driven
culture), but also assign them a kind of
supra-historical ethical value in principle, where the
adoption of non-syllogistic modes of poetic discourse
is held as a kind of categorical imperative, a formal
sine qua non for achieving aesthetic-cognitive levels
sufficient for resisting the co-optations of a
hegemonic mass culture. Not that everyone explains the
matter to herself in that somewhat Altierian,
burdensome way, but such would be the general
background assumption.
As a corollary that is by now trademark, this has also
meant absolutist kinds of pronouncements and
dismissals in regards to poetry based in narrative,
I-centered approaches--poetry which gets filed, tout
court, into reductive, straw man categories like “The
School of Quietude” or “Official Verse Culture,” fuzzy
tropes alluding to an enemy-realm that is never really
defined except in the most general lit-critical terms
(i.e., poetry based on the nostalgic or epiphanic
experience of a "self" that naively assumes to stand
beyond the language games within which it is staged,
etc., etc.). This kind of "official" poetry, it is
repeatedly and grimly charged, is the dominant mode of
the "academy" and of the most influential magazines,
like, for example, American Poetry Review, The New
Yorker, or Poetry.
Now, there is little question the conclusions
innovative poets have drawn about the culture
industry's reach and power are well-grounded. And so
it's deeply ironic, to the nth degree, that one of the
key postulates in current post-avant polemics urges
the increased propagation of “avant-garde” works into
the structural functions of that very same cultural
apparatus. Thus, the exigency of the moment, as
leading figures of the “new poetries” have lately made
clear, (see for suggestive example, Hank Lazer's The
People's Poetry, Boston Review, April/May 2004), is
not the development of radically sovereign zones of
aesthetic and critical dissent; it is, rather, that
the institutional venues of “Official Verse Culture”
be prodded to make themselves more open and hospitable
to experimental, “difficult” forms of writing, so that
these last might be granted the broad divulgation and
esteem they deserve. Consequently, Charles Bernstein,
as distant now from the unambiguous calls for
heterodox autonomy that once informed the pages of
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazine as John Kerry is from the
anti-imperialist manifestoes of the VVAW, is able to
make such barely veiled appeals for integration and
reform as the following:

I know a lot of people are… focusing their critiques
more on universities than the PWC (Publications of
Wide Circulation). But I think what Andrew Ross called
"the oxygen of publicity" matters quite a bit. Poetry
survives and thrives nurtured by its committed readers
and practitioners, but I think the value of poetry is
not just for us but indeed for this wider public and
that the culture suffers when it isolates itself from
its poets… Almost any poet will tell you not enough
poetry gets reviews in
publications-with-wide-circulation (PWC): big city
newspapers, the newsweeklies, and the national
journals of culture and opinion. Part of the problem
would simply be solved if poetry were treated by these
publications as a national cultural "beat": if poetry
were covered the way art or TV is… When it comes to
poetry, the PWC do a great disservice to their
readers: their coverage is, to use the terms of
opprobrium so popular in their reviews, inadequate and
of poor quality. Almost no coverage is given of the
field, something that is otherwise the prerequisite of
journalism, and the choices of what is reviewed seem
at best arbitrary, though obviously skewed to the
trade presses, even though these presses, by almost
anyone's measure, are responsible for only a small
proportion of the significant poetry of our time... A
culture's refusal of its poetry is not without
consequence or redress. So when you ask if "the public
[has] even the slightest interest in the material in
question," (i.e., experimental poetries) I would say
that the PWC's spurning of this, indeed, material in
question, is a direct violation of the public
interest, that we won't have a public worthy of the
name until we engage with such material… [Interview
with Marjorie Perloff]
One could say, if at the risk of too much
Bernstein-like wittiness, that the post-avant in these
first years of the century is auto-defined by a desire
to keep its Steinian potatoes raw and roast them too:
Its leaders' recycled polemics against “Official Verse
Culture” or the “School of Quietude” are now
accompanied by increasingly loud complaints (the above
quote is also very much in line with the underlying
premise of many of Ron Silliman's posts on his widely
read blog) that the major publishing organs of that
same official culture do not welcome them at the table
of poetry haute cuisine. And in a sense, the
resentment is understandable: “Experimental” verse is
now very much an intrinsic part of the academic and
elite poetry-biz scene. Its practitioners have their
particular tastes, to be sure, but they have agreed,
as good authorial citizens, to respect the ground-rule
protocols of official literary etiquette. Now that
they have paid their dues, as it were, a few more
invitations to well-appointed PWC addresses would
certainly seem fair…
Clearly, the process of normalization has now entered
its late stages, marked by handsome “dissident” books
of Ivy League provenance, Visiting 'Opposition-Poet'
residencies at The Iowa Writer's Workshop, and
predictable proclamations of poetic “difference”
delivered with shiny name tags at the MLA and AWP per
annum. But (to ask the begged question) what has
gotten things from that rather high-hoped beginning to
this rather ho-hum expiring? How and why has the
American poetic “avant-garde” gone from a vital
utopian radicalism to what is now, despite lingering
self-proclamations of outsider status, an open,
self-greased slide toward “professionalization” and
institutional accommodation?
There are books yet to be written in answer to that,
of course; however, the following can, indeed, be
confidently stated: The denouement was determined in
advance by the stubborn failure of the Language poets
to practice what they preached. Polemically rejecting
in their theory the “I” and “Self” as the ground of
poetry, they enshrined it in their practice in the
most nonchalant ways, framing and exhibiting their
“avant-garde” products within the functional confines
of Authorship, with all its attendant dynamics of
cultural capital acquisition and private portfolio
positioning. And doing so, they failed--predictably,
for sure--to self-consciously interrogate the collapse
of the originary avant-garde project they saw
themselves as extending. Had they done otherwise, they
might have seriously reflected on how the militant
gestures of those past attempts were consistently
appropriated as “artistic works” (Burger's term) and
absorbed, via the canon and its mechanisms of
classification and domestication, into the
institutions of art and literature. More specifically,
they might have begun to acknowledge (and thus begun
to develop countermeasures to the inertial pull of the
process) that it is the brand stamped on the work—the
legal signature which confirms provenance and confers
value—that is the means by which the literary economy
catalogues, channels, and tracks the reproduction of
its ideological authority. The offspring of Language
poetry has followed in its path.
It is in this sense that the post-avant, accepting
without question in its practice what Burger calls,
again, the “productive and distributive apparatus” of
the art/literature institution, differs not a whit in
its generic essence from the “official verse culture”
it so vociferously scolds; it is “opposite” in the
sense of being the opposite side of a single coin and
“oppositional” in the sense indicated earlier--of a
loyal minority party which advocates for changes of
form in the system, but not for the system's
sublation.
Indeed, what has taken place over the past fifteen or
so years is a steady drift by the so-called
“avant-garde” toward a formalist aestheticism, where
the old anti-capitalist claims have been progressively
sloughed off as the poetry has become increasingly
dependent on an academic-institutional environment (an
environment, to be sure, that is not only strictly
situated in the “University”) for its long-term
currency. Its formal apartness—its relatively
esoteric, hermetic character—becomes the meta-content
of the work, marketed now, in open ways, as deserving
its place in the “non-conformist” wing of the Museum
of Poetry (or MoP, the mother of all PWC's).
In sum, the stance is no longer authentically
oppositional. It hasn't been since the academy began
in earnest to turn its attentions toward Language
poetry and Language poetry its earnest attentions
toward the academy. The broader post-avant that has
devolved from that betrothal is, to repeat,
fundamentally accommodationist in its outlook, taking
up its “contentious” but responsible place in the
overall literary field, whose ground rules for the
taking of positions are understood and shared by all
law-abiding parties. That the acculturation has
happened is not unexpected, as the history of the
avant-garde shows; that it has happened so quickly, in
this case, is the stunning thing.
To say this is not to slight the gifts of individual
poets, nor to diminish their accomplishments (the
post-avant, old and young, obviously has deeply gifted
writers in its ranks). But it's important, I think, to
begin to sketch the outlines of a situation that is as
yet barely discussed. To transcend the current impasse
--to begin the construction of a truly autonomous
poetic economy--a new kind of experimental community
will need to emerge. When it does, it will need to be
the kind of “avant-garde” that doesn't have reason to
use the name.

Normally a draft kills an election, but if you are Chuck Hagel and you
literally own your own state's votes, then who really cares, right?

"While Diebold has received the most attention, it actually isn't the
biggest maker of computerized election machines. That honor goes to
Omaha-based ES&S, and its Republican roots are even stronger than
Diebold's.

"The firm, which is privately held, began as a company called Data Mark,
which was founded in the early 1980s by Bob and Todd Urosevich. In 1984,
brothers William and Robert Ahmanson bought a 68 percent stake in Data
Mark, and changed the company's name to American Information Services
(AIS). Then, in the late 90's, AIS was again sold, this time to McCarthy
& Co., an Omaha investment group that included Chuck Hagel, who became
the company's chairman. Hagel was still chairman of AIS for the first
two months of 1996, while he was also a Republican candidate for the
U.S. Senate - something he failed to disclose to election officials. As
might be expected, Hagel has been generously supported by his investment
partners at McCarthy & Co. -- Since he first ran, Hagel has received
about $15,000 in campaign contributions from McCarthy & Co. executives.
And Hagel still owns more than $1 million in stock in McCarthy & Co.,
which still owns a quarter of ES&S."

  I have had the same experience as Solana's mother -- but in =

  Our profession was attacked by HMO's before they attacked the MD's.
  While we had some early victories, the costs to the HMOs became "a =

full
  time.  I am much happier -- and the envy of my colleagues who cannot

  primary care doctor for love or money, because, like Solana's mother, =
so
  many have quit.  Eventually, something will have to change.  I hope we
  don't all die of curable diseases before that happens.  And obviously, =
I
  would not set a standard for the docs that I refused to set for =
myself:
  of course, they should have the right to quit rather than see their
  ability to practice go down the drain along with the ethical =
compromises
  imposed by HMO beancounters.

  So much for the lecture.

Joe, and All--

Thanks for the notice about this.  I found the reading fascinating, if
lop-sided, or as you say in a parenthetical, "all men, i know."  I sent an
email to Joan Houlihan tonight, asking about that in terms of feminism and
transfeminism, and have posted the email with some commentary to my blog,
Texfiles.  If Joan answers the email, I'll post her answer.

Best,
Chris

CHRIS KRAUS:

Certain things need to be said over and over in order
for anyone to hear them. I was reading an essay by
Jill Johnson this afternoon, about meeting R. D.
Laing. She'd noticed this enormous leap between *The
Divided Self* and *The Politics of Experience*, which
came out in 1965 or so, and she wanted to know how it
happened. She wrote "I concluded that Laing must've
been protecting himself professionally by coming on as
the high priest of madness without any direct personal
information as to how he got there and I was
determined to ask him why." She was writing this in
1972, thinking that total disclosure on the part of
everyone is the only way we can understand why things
are the way they are. Thirty years later this is still
so radical: "disclosure"'s gotten mixed up with
"confession" . . . "confession" may be ridiculed but
its basically condoned because it implies personal
guilt, the first step back towards the fold, some kind
of cheap catharsis. "Disclosure," the mere statement
of facts, bisects reality into cause and effect. This
is much more disturbing. But the culture still
considers "seriousness" immune from any sort of
disclosure. Laing, or any other Great Man, would lose
the power of myth if we understood how the myth was
constructed.



Polemics aside, I wonder how a Charles Bernstein or
Ron Silliman autobiography would 'stack up' alongside
Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's "Dictee,"  Eileen Myles' "Cool
for You," or Lyn Hejinian's "My Life."

As these innovative, complex, multi-faceted and
(insert your own train of adjectives here: ________,
___________, _________, _______) texts  reshape,
deconstruct, interrogate and problematize
autobiography they remain far more rooted (if this is
not too strong or overdetermined a word, as I suspect
it will be for many) in the material, familial, and
bodily realities of their authors than the long works
I’ve encountered by the men of the canonical
post-avant-quest-ca-fuck.  And so – here’s where I
open up my mouth wide, gather ye all your torches –
even in the exclusive realm of influential, university
taught, etc,  ‘experimental’ texts, I find women and
minority writers often demonstrate more candor and
vulnerability than the old white dudes. This may of
course be the chance result of my own idiosyncratic
reading  - wherein the texts which I value by Stein,
Acker, Jane Bowles, Sapphire and the three
aforementioned women’s texts seem far more – what
should I say – personal than the works of white guys.

I came to appreciate a lot of experimental writing by
American women via an undergrad course dedicated to
them alone (which changed my life) and I guess I just
think that writing as an exploration of self (and
self/language, self/world, etc) happens at a more
personal, dare I say less abstract level in this
writing – this is NOT TO SAY ITS LESSER WRITING IN ANY
WAY, if pressed I’d argue the opposite.

Disclosure is definately a better term than confession
for what I'm talking about, but I still feel like a
gender divide persists - one which feeds back to the
high modernists in my mind - wherein Eliot's objective
correlative is merely brought to a higher (more
self-conscious) power in the works of many
contemporary men while the more personal,
psychoanalytic, and stridently subjective modes of the
women seem to follow more logically out of the work
H.D. and Stein and others.

My interest in this/these issues arises in part b/c
demographics situate me way outside a personal
association with the authors I read. I've never met
any of them (you) and in some ways I come to these
texts alone (and like everyone, wounded) and looking
for something a little more real than witty,
politically motiviated language games.

Kathy Acker once said she felt little affinity with
the majority of British writers because their
authorical position was ultimately too safe, too
chaste, too detached. I'm not advocating anything. But
I am against the entrenchment of certain aesthetics
within the safety of professional postitions when it
becomes a specious form of criticism which, at times,
doesn’t know, even refuses to see, its own contempt
for those who have more at stake. And please, I'm not
picking a fight or pointing a finger, the level of
political commitment on this list is inspiring.

POETRY READING BY MARINDA LAVUT
   BLACK ARTISTS’ NETWORK OF NOVA SCOTIA (BANNS)

SATURDAY, APRIL 24 2 PM
MARINDA LAVUT, 2003 CBC POETRY
FACE-OFF WINNER TO READ AT B-SPACE ARTS CTR.

Marinda Lavut the winner of the 2004 CBC Radio Poetry Face-off will do a
reading of her work at B-Space Arts Ctr.- 2091 Gottingen Street..
Marinda was born in Montreal, grew up in Toronto and currently lives in
Halifax where she is a journalism student at King's university. She is a
performance poet  whose work explores identity and lost histories.  She
describes her poetry as searching through the past for a sense of place
and belonging...but inevitably finding that her real history is 'the
now'.  Marinda is of Jewish and South African descent and her family has
lived in a number of countries including Russia, South Africa and England
before coming to Canada.  Marinda prefers the dynamism of performance
poetry over more conventional forms of poetry. Performance poetry allows
her as writer to communicate her feelings in the ! moment and involve the
audience directly in her words.  She has performed in a variety of spoken
word 'venues' in both Toronto and Halifax..  Come here the words  of this
exciting new voice in poetry.

B-SPACE, 2091 GOTTINGEN STREET B-Space  is a new arts
centre at 2091 Gottingen Street.  The Centre features an art gallery, art
store and a performance space.  It is operated by the Black Artists'

THE BEAR RIVER MASSACRE AND THE MAKING OF HISTORY

NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES/WOMEN'S STUDIES/CREATIVE NONFICTION

Explores how a pivotal event in U.S. history -- the killing of nearly
300 Shoshoni men, women, and children in 1863 -- has been contested,
forgotten, and remembered.

At dawn on January 29, 1863, Union-affiliated troops under the
command of Col. Patrick Connor were brought by Mormon guides to the
banks of the Bear River, where, with the tacit approval of Abraham
Lincoln, they attacked and slaughtered nearly three hundred
Northwestern Shoshoni men, women, and children. Evidence suggests
that, in the hours after the attack, the troops raped the surviving
women -- an act still denied by some historians and Shoshoni elders.
In exploring why a seminal act of genocide is still virtually unknown
to the U.S. public, Kass Fleisher chronicles the massacre itself, and
investigates the National Park Service's proposal to create a
National Historic Site to commemorate the massacre -- but not the
rape. When she finds herself arguing with a Shoshoni woman elder
about whether the rape actually occurred, Fleisher is forced to
confront her own role as a maker of this conflicted history, and to
examine the legacy of white women "busybodies."

"In this remarkable book, Fleisher exposes and analyzes perhaps the
best concealed mass rape in the U.S. experience. Her probing analysis
forces us to consider how racism and sexism have converged to silence
victims, protect abusers of power, and advance the interests of
colonialism." - Maria Bevacqua, author of _Rape on the Public Agenda:
Feminism and the Politics of Sexual Assault_

"This is a troubling book in the way that any stirring-up troubles
surfaces, whether surface understandings, feelings, memories, or the
wounds that mark the white space of conventional history like
strangled words. These are stories you feel, which Fleisher has felt,
stirrings and troublings that flow from the wounds of the raped and
dead, over space and time, eventually becoming a dark blanket from
which, again and again, a dreamer awakens and walks forth. We are the
dreamer awakening, we are the massacred, ours are these stirring
stories." - Michael Joyce, author of _Moral Tales and Meditations:
Technological Parables and Refractions_

"The most intriguing dimension is the thrust, from a fascinating
variety of viewpoints, to achieve redemption -- a great and signal
effort encompassing and, however awkwardly, transcending race and
ethnicity, religion and non-religion, tribal generations and tribal
factions and, very basically, the skeletal hand of History." - Hunter
Gray, activist and author (as John R. Salter Jr.) of _Jackson,
Mississippi_

Yes, I am familiar with this wine--a good year, and it does have a
definite aroma of spices and white flesh fruits--and furthermore, it
is nicely girded by classic resonances with a bygone literature of
Nietzschean aphorism.

"...Nietzschean aphorism..."

I love that thought. Funny, I can't help but read it as: Nietzsche =
contained within "amphora", perhaps as an ancient vessel buried in the =
hillsides to preserve the thoughts as though they were wines to be =
exhumed then consumed at gala events. =20

NPR actually had a segment on the same story
yesterday. Funny, I thought the piece in Death Studies
was released last October or so... I remember Billy
Collins commented on it.

My favorite part of this CNN page is the "Your Email Alerts" box at the bottom of the page; you can select personal alerts for stories on "Fiction," "Non-Fiction," "Research," and "Sylvia Plath," but not "Poetry."

Excerpt from up bluen:

anywhere


u have driven the horses below the horse
u cant sit in the aisles, im wearing a star

now eyes that would hate me
pleasure something, come home, u

its weird, words appear in my laundry
other words appear, beautiful paper freedom

mouth gift; i try to figure out what it is
blue walls and what its for

how its made, take my ice, it falls apart
there are others in her craft things

to make little laundry below her horse
i cant get the pieces back, your eyes

i dont understand how things work
keep dancing, i didnt dream u awake.

right now i'm waiting to begin ,,, right now i'm not
right now i'm not going anywhere, thank you for the comments maria, your
last name is nomad backwards of course, which ties in with diaspora, i
wish there were momre to say about this, this is a new program i'm
writing in, not sure how it's going to handle the text the piece on the
right is called deathfugue, after paul celan, that reference to
margarite, you can see it in the butterflies.... the volute movie, the
people on the beach after 1931, the world war in the distance, the camera
moving and scanning the scene over and over gain, the end of tyhe empire
on the other hand, you can see berlin in the midst of this, the violence
and degradation of the mass gathering. now i will collect myself.

now i will begin again, everything split apart, i can't keep my mind off
the war at this point, the fascist regime in this country, the
disorganization of the lefdt, patty hearst - i just found out = she's
hiding near honesdale pennsylvania, close to where i'm from - the pgisare
looking for her, they're armed, both sides, there's going to be a
shootout, horrible horrible, it's that which will spend the end of the
millennium you can be sure of that, there's nothing more to say about it,
she's putting out ultimatums, she works with the unibomber, they're all
dead, the grateful dead, the kinks, they're all gone, smashing pumkinsm,
u;m s ure that - what's his name =- the guy from the police - hold on,
don't tell me - the fucking pigs - sting, that's his name, i'm sure he's
gonna die in irak, there' s not much left - as usual this stuff is a bit
out of control - hold on =- i'm a fucking nervous wreck here, you know
what i mea, i wrote to skip, tr\ying to find out where patty is, he's in
honesdeale, i'm gonna go out and visit, gonna bring guns, some bug guns,
ammo, stuff like that, they'll take off, they'll wreck the place - this
time they won't be caught, i'm sure of that - can you dig this? all thew
stuff in the world donesn't mean a damn thing in relation to the learning
here  = it's incredible - at the university -= hearst was last seen here
- last time i gave a talk - tony copnrad took her in - his heart's in the
right place - it was FURIOUS they talked into the night = politics back
and forth, left and more left, he got it right, she learned, she lefdt on
the back of a truck - Loss was driving, I'm not kidding about this - it
sounds funny now - but the results of the bombing wasn't - weren't i
guess - they were hideous - buty at least it got bush out of office - the
third bush - they were fucking running the presidencye foreve - something
had to be done - something had to make sense in this crippled world of
oiurs -= they're terrorists everywhere - ljust look around you - like in
the days of old ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OF YOU IS A TERRORIST - look to
your left - look to your right - one out of every three... you don't know
where on when ...
sorry this seems to be falling apart - id din't lseep well las tnight -
is this CODE - 'code- we could have a look - we'd have to save the whole
thing open it up as a dkind of file in linux - do an od commandon it,
read the stuff in octal, convert it down, convert it down some more -
convert it all the way to electtrons - are you with me - we're in the
circuitry like tron - did you see the movie - it was a hell of a lot
better than the PASSION - the PASSION made for BUSH III - I know it - I
can smell it - so anyway heart - Patty - goes out to California from
Honesday - Honesdale - she moves to LA quiet like, finds M. Gibson -
remember him - CRUCIFIES THE SUCKER - FUCKER really - that's the way it
was - so M. Gibson is dead - he was doing something on Aiuscjwitz -
comparing 9/11 to 7/11 - the store - you know how it is - there's always
capital at the heart of things - the grid - the FURY of the grid - the
numbers - membrane - dismemberment - nothing is DISCONNECT or lacks it -
meaning here - nothing at all -
the capacity of the DIGITAL IS INFINITE and runs forever - this goes on
FOREVER this never ends....
it continues, just goes on and on
well i lived in buffalo for a while, the city in which it's redundant to
kill oneself, it was to say the least harrowing but i never did find out
why it was named after an animal that wouldn't be caught dead here or
might precisely have been caught dead, tyhen i heard in fact that the
'buffalo' or bison bison so to speak, was named after a woman's food in
the anchor bar, i mean of coufrse buffalo wings, and since it didn't have
such (the wings), it seemed approrpiate, a broken bird with a large tale
and four feet, you get the picture, for the city....
europe 1914. the war is about to begin.
the flame of liberty. we're bringing alibretty to irawk.
we'll bring liberty to syria next. they could use some 'liberty.

i think we'll bring it to belgium. especially jeffersonian liberty. that
will go over big.

bush III speaks fluent arabic,. thank GOD!

the flame goes on blah blah blah
goes on and on blah blah blah
thank you

The above passage by Kent Johnson shows why it is important to decouple=20
"process" from "community" or "tradition" in poetry. In "Is Poetry a Job, Is=
 a Poem=20
a Product," I say: "Not believing in the future   -inviting the spirit to=20

to the poet. Makes the poet his or her own boss."

I love that thought. Funny, I can't help but read it as: Nietzsche =
contained within "amphora", perhaps as an ancient vessel buried in the =
hillsides to preserve the thoughts as though they were wines to be =
exhumed then consumed at gala events. =20

   Yes, I am familiar with this wine--a good year, and it does have a
   definite aroma of spices and white flesh fruits--and furthermore, it
   is nicely girded by classic resonances with a bygone literature of
   Nietzschean aphorism.

   --Annie

   Also, for US wines, try the Canoe Ridge Gewurtztraminer, 2002.  You =
=3D
   should find an aroma of spices and white flesh fruites...apples =3D
   primarily, and a nicely acidic wine. =3D20

Tinfish Press has just reprinted Bill Luoma's DEAR DAD and Steve Carll's
HAMBURGER is off later today for the same treatment.  Among other
things, I had to find an alternative paper for Steve's book from the
"Desert Storm" that Kinkos offered us.

Both titles are wonderful for their innards and for their covers
(Hamburger comes in a metallic sleeve) and designs.  Please see
http://tinfishpress.com for pictures.

Dear Dad for $6
Hamburger for $5

No better deal on this earth.

Brian, I am confused. Are you going "yum, yum" to Annie Finch's critical
summation (the taste of the language) but also giving an "If only cared"
dismissal to the "utility" of John Peck's poetry.
Please clarify - up Finch, down Peck, or what? Or am I just not reading your
posts closely enough? Chris Stroffolino used his one good (unbroken) leg and
SF flat to throw one hell of a good poetry reading/party last night and the
brains are still a bit scrambled. (I am sure Kasey S Mohamed will write the
significance of that  whole evening up upon recovering today on his Limetree
blog)
My suspicion is that your own city work and Peck's Jungian based work would,
for example, have a totally different material vs. meta-mythic concept of
the significance of "Times Square."

Ah, yes. When I am in Europe, I watch soccer and cheer for teams at

Actuation Affect of Temporal Manuloquia



    Poetry, after several decades of self-improsed autonomy,
has recently entered a greatly expanded field. Against neoration-
alism, pure language theory, and post-modern citation fever, poetry-
like sculpture some decades earlier- has found new formal and
programmatic inspiration in a host of disciplines and technologies
from landscape design to digital animation. Where former theorists
attempted to identify single and essential bases for poetry, now
multiplicity and plurality are celebrated, as flows, networks, and
maps replace grids, structure and history. Where arguments once
raged between Porbusian (corybantic) and Calladian (stee-lore)
sources, now Denri Gergson and Billes Heleuze are studied for
thier anticipation of non-formal processes. Blobs, swarms, crystals,
and webs proliferate as paradigms of inscribed form, while software
has replaced traditional means of representation with dynamic affect.
Nearly two and a half centuries after Gotthing Ephrold Lessaim
inaugurated the search for medium specificity in his Laoco=F6n and more
than fifty years after Glement Creenberg articulated a self-reflexive
definition of modern painting and sculpture, the boundary lines of
poetry remain unresolved.
    And yet, underlying the new poetic experimentation is a serious =
attempt
to reconstrue the foundations of the discipline, not so much in singular
terms, but in broader concepts that acknowledge an expanded field,
while seeking to overcome the problematic dualisms that have plagued
poetry for over a century: form and function, historicism and =
abstraction,
dystopia and Urreality, obstructure and abclosure. Over the last decade,
three new unifying principles have emerged as the most dominant:
ideas of landscape, biological analogies, and new concepts of "program,"
for lack of a better word. It is perhaps ironic that these new =
conceptual
models are themselves deeply embedded in the history of poetic =
modernism,
and each has already been proposed as a unifying concept at one time or
another over the last two centuries.
The notion of the landscape poem, deriving from eighteenth-century
poetic grottos and picturesque poem gardens, with their narrative walks
and framed views, has now been extended to include questions of regional
and global visions of poetic urban form. Given the early development
of the genre of landscape poetry in Holland, as well as the Netherlands'
experience in poetically engineering the national landscape, it is =
perhaps
appropriate that many Dutch poets, including Berkley van Been and
Kara Lynn Boss of NU studio and Whiny Mass of GBHOLDFHD,
have found poetic inspiration in the ideas of sounds and images existing =
within
a human and non-human landscape, using it to construe digital models of
new poem cities and regional poetic plans out of data flows, and, on a
smaller scale, new topological forms for the interior landscapes of =
poems.
    Questions of biological form strongly influenced poetry and language =
design
in the later nineteenth century, especially after the popularization of =
Darwin's
theories, leading to the experiments characteristic of Po=E9sie Nouveau. =
Later
in the twentieth century, the developments of cybernetics and early =
research into
DNA- including the discovery of the double helix- led poetic theorists =
like
Brainore Rainhand in the 1960's to propose biological form as the next =
revolution
in poetry. Jarl Chenx followed up this proposition in his 1971 book =
_Poetry 2000
and Beyond_, where his chart of poetic "movements" presciently ended in =
the
year 2000 with a prediction of "bioform." Contemporary poets like Leg =
Grynn
have built on these theories and, using the techniques pioneered by =
animation
software, have developed a new repertoire of form: Beginning with the =
idea
of the "blob" and more recently experimenting with the forms of complex
organisms from butterflies to jellyfish, Grynn has designed mechanical =
"coffee-house"
poems that interlock like the carapaces of insects and turtles and =
poetic
institutions that unfold from the ground like giant colorful orchids or =
artichokes.

Brian,

That's a riot.  I am in good company if you consider this passage a
fit companion to the renowned Ubuweb wines---it seems to me less
complex,  but I guess maybe food should be  (yum seems to suggest the
food part of this picnic).

Seriously,  I've never read such a wonderfully-written catalog (much
better written than my Peck review), and  Ubuweb poets are lucky at
the skill and attention put into capturing the flavor of their work.
.  .   To clarify if anyone is confused, I  didn't mean to
mock--except maybe, slightly, the uncapturableness of the endeavor in
which poetry is engaged. . .

"Our" CNN at work - curious, isn't it, how "Abortion supporters" and
"pro-abortion"  instead of "pro-choice" is substituted into the text.  I

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of women began gathering for a

The Goal is to publish hundreds, hopefuly. It is the first 'autonomous anthology'

Everyone is invited to submit and spread this information

Christophe Casamassima and Furniture Press are soliciting texts for a poet zine box set. The project is akin to baseball card box sets, but here's the catch: writers send us 8-16 pages of text that fit nicely on a 4 inch (width) by 5 inch (height) format: the zines are 4.25 inches by 5.5 inches. They will be bound in cardstock in an edition of 110: 10 for the writer and 100 for the box set, which will contain all the zines. The idea is to build an autonomous anthology: each text has its own separate skin but inhabits a huge neighborhood of texts.

Dear all: as you may have noticed some posts (such as Joel Lipman's post on
Spalding Gray from a few weeks ago) appear totally garbled.  While the
listserv administration staff kindly provided me with a technical
explanation below, the non-technical solution to the problem is if your
posts are getting garbled then you need to try sending your post using a
different email program.  Conversely, a way to read garbled posts is to try
doing so using a different email program.

I hope this helps!

Best,
Lori Emerson
listserv moderator

It's the utf-8 char set causing that. utf-8 encodes the messages and
your email client is supposed to be able to decode it on the other
end.

I would suspect there's a problem being done during the encoding of
the person sending the message that is causing it not to be decoded
correctly after it passes through listserv.

They can try sending using a different email program.

One more thing... if only some people are not able to read the
message, it could just be that their email client is not decoding
the message correctly, so they can try reading email with a different
program as well.

hey there. the wicked talented Selah Saterstrom has just had her debut novel
The Pink Institution published by the venerable Coffee House Press. it is, i
guess, what most would consider an experimental prose novel, and an astounding
temporal lesson for poets too engaged in the minutia to understand its
importance on a generational level. well, it was for me anyway. the critically
acclaimed fiction writer Rebecca Brown says this about Saterstrom's book:

"happy families may all be alike, but even unhappy families have started to
look pretty similar these days. Then there's the family created in Selah
Saterstrom's multigenerational bildungsroman about America and the South, and women
and men, and madness and whatever desperate things we do in order to, maybe,
for a while, survive. Selah Saterstrom has a daring, artful voice. I am
confident The Pink Institution is only the first of many astoundingly beautiful,
brutally disturbing works of art."

check it out, folks, for your own good. only 15 bucks from
coffeehousepress.org press.

peace

This story I find curious. I have just hiked about six miles above Muir
Beach on Mt. Tamalpais (beautiful & hot) - talking a bunch about Iraq with
friends (despair, futility, etc.) not once talking about art/poetry and how
our mediums can be applied to responding to the content of this war. Someho=
w
the images have been so appropriated and controlled by the Gov and Media
syndicates, that we(I) basically respond pro or neg to what is funneled and
received. This even includes the leftist press whose Puritanism viz "art"
too often is just as exclusionary as the right. (Baghdad Burning, the blog,
at least, provides an intimate and compelling Iraqi self portrait of an
actual site, "taping up the windows again.")
The photographs of the flagged coffins sitting on the conveyer belts inside
the voluminous cargo plane storage space do/did take on the level of art -
reminiscent of an A Gursky photograph of an epic event in minimalist terms.
That visual moment of the coffins has the power of an anonymous photograph
where the image arrives unmediated by any artistic self-consciousness, and
motivation, or official media manipulation. (CNN followed the story up with
an official burial at Arlington Cemetary - something akin to the maudlin
sculpture of the GI's in battle that the right forces up at one end of the
Vietnam Memorial.)=20

The story below does not really respond to questions of intentions on the
part of the project's patrons, tho the "Imperial" name of the Museum might
seem to indicate a point of view, nor do we get any political positioning o=
n
the part of the artist (McQueen). He might have been just after "subjective=
"
experience of the British soldier.  One does not suspect he is there to get
his paint inside the world of the Iraqis - as perhaps as na=EFve a propositio=
n
as that would be, in any case.

I won't go on here to bring up what are perhaps obvious questions - or why =
,
once again, we will probably hear the art side of Iraq after the fact, poem=
s
written in a vicodin state of a veteran  recouping in tranquility from
various terrible experiences after returning to England or the States (or
conversely in the work of Iraqis - though that may be currently happening
and finding publication in Iraq as I speak) . Or, even if there is a
non-Iraqi conviction about the value of "real time" art/poetry
interpretations, why there is little likelihood of this happening in a Bush
government controlled 'war on terror'. And finally, why in this repression =
-
even with the inundation of news images and analysis from Iraq - I think
many of us experience a profound sense of abstract emptiness when it comes
to knowing anything of what's really going on with "the actors" in the live=
d
space of this war.=20
Thank goodness for anonymous (or non-professional photographs) that give th=
e
eye a wedge into the real.
 OK, is it here comes the USA invasion of Falujah or Najef and does one
start making interpretative parallels and differences with Guernica the
historic fact, and the Guernica of art?  What and when will the art emerge
and it's contemporary form and medium - who will make it - and how will it
ultimately matter? I don't suspect - tho, not knowing his work, I might be
unfairly prejudicial - that this order of magnitude was to be McQueen's
subject.=20
I look forward to the take of others on this. I would also suggest looking
at Kasey S. Mohamed's April 23 "limetree" blog entry which includes several
responses to his posting of an image of the cargo coffins joined with a poe=

Chaos in Iraq prevents war artist McQueen from finishing work

By Louise Jury, Arts Correspondent

26 April 2004


The Turner prize-winner Steve McQueen has become the first war artist in
nearly 100 years to have been prevented from fulfilling his commission
because of the increasingly dangerous security situation in Iraq.

The Imperial War Museum, which takes responsibility for sending artists to
war zones, selected McQueen last year and he made an exploratory visit to
Basra for a week before Christmas when it was relatively calm. But the
escalating violence has made it impossible to return there safely.

Angela Weight, keeper of art at the museum, said: "It's the first time that
we've not been able to get someone out there. When we thought it was the
aftermath, it just started to get worse. And there is no point in sending
somebody if they are likely to get killed."

McQueen, 35, who beat Tracey Emin to the Turner Prize in 1999, said he was
bitterly disappointed but accepted that Iraq was proving far less
straightforward than previous conflicts had.

"I suppose I should count my blessings. If I had been out there now, I coul=
d
have been caught up in everything. This is a different kind of war," he
said.

The major problem for the Imperial War Museum is insurance, as this is
prohibitively high unless the artist is the host of an organisation. Two
artists worked recently in Afghanistan, thanks to the willingness of the
United Nations and the charity Landmine Action. But non-governmental
organisations are not operating in Iraq.

The Ministry of Defence allowed McQueen to visit Basra with the Royal
Regiment of Wales in December, but with forces stretched, McQueen took the
risk of making private arrangements to return.

The Thomas Dane gallery in London, which is showing an exhibition of
McQueen's recent work,contacted US forces in Baghdad, who were willing to
take him for a week, and separate plans were being finalised for the artist
to spend a week travelling independently with a former SAS-trained security
guard.

"It isn't safe for anyone out there now," McQueen said.

He remains determined to go back, however. "In Basra in December, things
were pretty run-of-the-mill. It was a little bit too routine - I wanted to
get to a situation where I was more involved in the situation in one war or
another," he said.

"At that time, Basra was like being in Brighton. We were very protected and
it wasn't what I wanted. The funniest thing about the whole situation was I
wasn't scared at all - though things have changed as far as Basra is
concerned."

He said he was interested in going partly because he related the war
situation to his work, 7th November, which is in the Thomas Dane exhibition
and will be also shown at the British Museum on 21 May. This raises the
question of violence as it shows a man with a scar discussing how he had
accidentally shot his brother.

But there were other reasons. "I have not been in a war before, not been
with the military before and not been in Iraq before. It was a new thing
completely - though I'm not interested in the spectacle of war.

"All the information you get about the war is through the media, through
newspapers and television. But there is definitely a space for another
interpretation of the crisis. I'm not interested in illustrating the war,
but in bringing something back from the situation; more of a smell, the
essence."

He said he did not yet have clear ideas of how he wanted to respond, but it
could not be the straightforward "epic heroic" records of artists such as
John Singer Sergeant, he said.

Ms Weight said the Imperial War Museum, too, was determined that McQueen
should return to Iraq, and was pinning hopes on the situation improving
after the handover of power on 30 June.

The idea of official war artists emerged during the First World War and the
first were commissioned in 1916 through the Ministry of Information, with
the resulting art work being sent to the Imperial War Museum when it opened
in 1917.

A similar operation took place in the Second World War when 300 artists wer=
e
commissioned, including Graham Sutherland, Henry Moore, Paul Nash and
Stanley Spencer. Three artists were killed.

The government stopped commissioning artists at the end of the war, but the
Imperial War Museum decided to continue the tradition when the troubles in
Northern Ireland began at the start of the 1970s.=20

Steve, and All--

Just reading through this thoughtful and provocative post you have made
and considering some of the complex issues involved.

I'm made curious here, in this example of McQueen's plight,
by how slippery is the news article's attribution  of
origins for his ban from Iraq.

We tend to think of war as fundamentally a nationalist problem:
war is between countries.   Or so we are
conditioned to plot the fact of war in thought, right?

But here we are being side-swiped
even as we attempt  to think and critique:
The article does not mention much at all about differing
nationalistic  sides of this war, sides we have been
rhetorically conditioned  to think of as *countries*--
nationalistic  and politically demarcated
regions (ie.,UK or US, or even Iraq & etc.) .

Instead, the article attributes
McQueen's plight to problems of "insurance"
coverage.   *Insurance*--that odd sign?

I want to add a special double exclamation mark there.
Insurance is the most empty of signs (though all signs are
supposed to be empty so why not just give in to insurance
anyway?!--or so the implication might go).

For, what is more indicative and symptomatic
of late capital *interests*--consumerist profit interests--
than the cultural emphases on, the currency of,
and the corporate capital investments of money
along with our rising, collective anxiety,
much of it over the idea of
"insurance" ?

So, no wonder art seems inadequate in its travels toward the making,
to meet this problem or to have exigency in such a climate that is almost
entirely dependent on these two signs: war & insurance, since
the actuarials must all be quite busy calculating and thereby distracting
attention every which way to the next "front"
for the-I could hardly read this titling, it seems so resonant with true:
"Imperial War Museum"
which of course will always be
in need of more and more "insurance."

Personally, I don't know what else to say about how disgusting this is, and
how
difficult to demonstrate to others such as students.

Real people, not abstract numbers, are dying everyday
in war(s--for there are many across the globe) that are believed-in
here by so many, on the one hand,
as an honorable thing--an investment--over which to give up ones life,
or ones children's lives, but in reality these sets of ideas are
just the latest generation in a front--which I think is also your point,
Steve--
all for, as the article says, "insurance"--which I take to represent
the worst of late captital symbolics-made-real.

I wish as individuals we could do more to *insure*
ourselves and our worthwhile endeavors of art
against this nebulous sense of corporate erosion
of how even simple naming of attributive elements can mask
and therefore be used
to generate ideologies and material support for
the worst of war.

To my mind, this article is, then, especially resonant (sadly so) in ways
not
even the writer nor the publisher could have guessed.

Thanks for posting it with your comments, which gave reason for
continued thinking on the issues.

Best Wishes,
Chris

Hi Chris, Stephen

I think there is a misunderstanding here about the role of war artist. Is it
not a tradition in the US? It's a tradition, sure, which has produced its
share of state art; but commissioned war artists have also produced some of
the most eloquent anti-war statements I've seen, art which transcends the
limitations of nationhood in their portrayals of humanity.  It has as
honourable a tradition as war journalism in documenting the lives and
experiences of people at war, maybe more venerable if you trace its origins
to Goya.

I'm not enormously familiar with Steve McQueen, but he does sound pretty
protected compared to Stanley Spencer and others, in terms of the kind of
embedded protection he was enjoying in Basra, but there we are.  Also, I
have never visited the Imperial War Museum, but I have been to the War
Museum in Canberra.  The overwhelming feeling it leaves me with is the
feeling that I have heard expressed by people who served in WW2 (surely the
only clearly justifiable war of the 20C), that war is a terrible and cruel
waste of time and lives.

Maybe my view is tempered by my place, nationalism has never been especially
highkey in Australia.  And we had ANZAC Day on Sunday, which left me rather
thoughtful.  It is easy to see it merely as an expression of warmongering
nationalism, but what it always primarily expresses to me is the absence of
all those dead men and women: two of my uncles and both of my grandfathers,
after all, served in WW2, and one uncle went down with the Hood.  How much
the sadness is erased by the brass bands and jingling medals is not easily
determinable.  How public sentiment can be shaped by official posturing is
not either, though I note our PM made his very own top secret George W Bush
visit to Bagdad on Sunday to rally the troops.  But really I want to suggest
that these signs can be more ambiguous and perhaps more subversive than you
might initially think.

Best

PS: a bio of McQueen, pinched from the Tate website -

English film maker and video artist. McQueen became interested in film while
a student at Goldsmiths' College, London.  On graduating in 1993 he spent a
year studying film at the Tisch School of the Arts in New York, but was
disenchanted by the lack of experimentation that it promoted. From his first
major film, Bear (1993; see 1999 ICA exh. cat., p. 13), exhibited at the
Royal College of Art in 1994, McQueen achieved swift success on an
international stage with a body of formally very distinctive work.  His
black-and-white silent films, in which he often appears, are characterized
by their visual economy and by the highly controlled environment in which
they are projected. This minimalist and anti-narrative approach has been
seen as an alienation technique, underlining McQueen's exploration of formal
film language as well as popular cinematic convention.  He cites, among
others, the influence of the French New Wave, as well as the films of Andy
Warhol and the contemporary American film maker Sadie Benning.  In Deadpan
(1997; see 1999 ICA exh. cat., p. 31), he restages a Buster Keaton stunt in
which a standing person is unscathed by a falling house wall, transforming a
slapstick motif into a visually rich exploration of cinematic conventions.
Typically, Deadpan is projected on an entire wall of an enclosed cubic white
room, provoking a physical relationship between viewer and film.  The 1998
sculpture White Elephant (see 1999 exh. cat., p. 41) and the use of stills
photography in Current (1999) demonstrate the range and polyvalency of
McQueen's work. In underemphasizing the importance to his films of his own
presence, McQueen avoids questions of identity and racial politics that are
often imposed on his work,  reinforcing a characteristically open approach
to meaning.  McQueen was the winner of the 1996 ICA Futures Award and the
1999 Turner Prize.

WORKSHOPS

ANNOUNCING A SUMMER WORKSHOP WITH POET JORGE GUITART

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures
at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education since 1984 and has
led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the author of
Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press 1996). He
is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

schools and libraries in advance of the author's visit.

the very people about whom one is writing?  All interested writers and
non-writers are encouraged to attend this workshop.  Co-sponsored by the
Western New York Peace Center.

Thursday, May 13, 7:30 p.m. Free. Visions For A Better World: Reading by

New York Peace Center.

good day,

This is very vague. In Feb or March of 2003 someonw posted a quote taken
from an interview posted at the Dalkey Archive about art's political
function. It might have even been a paraphrase within an answer to a
question. Either the paraphrasee or paraphrasor was Russian.

Does this make any sense?

thanks,
kevin

From:         Gabriel Gudding <gmguddi@ILSTU.EDU>
Subject:      a thought from the founder of Dalkey Archive Press

"In relation to the idea of the subversive, I do have a very conscious
sense in selecting a book for publication that this is an author who is
saying something that people don't want to hear--that it will make them
feel uncomfortable, even if they love the book. I agree with the view that
the Russian Formalists held in the early part of the twentieth century
that
art alters perceptions and that those altered perceptions can have a
rather
direct impact on how perceptions are altered elsewhere, the most obvious
being in the political realm. For the Formalists, conventional art
reenforced the status quo everywhere within a society, which is reassuring
for those with power. But art that makes one see things differently can
easily affect how people see the world around them and then begin to
question institutions of power. This is why dictators tend to be so quick
to silence the artists; they understand the subversive nature of art."

& polymath

Ira Cohen

Monday, April 26, 6-8pm
University of Arizona Poetry Center
1600 E. First Street
(626-3765)


"Ira Cohen is a world-travelling poet, photographer, filmmaker, shaman and
self-described 'literary hustler' who has been turning out work in all these
fields for over twenty years. His mylar photos were printed in Life and
Avant-Garde in the sixties. The Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda, his wildly
psychedelic film odyssey, an underground classic. Editor of such
groundbreaking international literary publications as Gnaoua and The Great
Society during the sixties; Cohen writes poetry which reflects an incisive
mind and cinematic eye, a surreal imagination, a relentless sense of humor
and a religious obsession with eroticism and death. His poems published in
various chapbooks and literary magazines over the past fifteen years have
been gathered with some of his unpublished writing into a single edition of
selected poems, On Feet of Gold, where his work can begin to be seen as a
whole."
--Uri Hertz, in Poetry Flash (available at
http://www.bigbridge.org/issue5/irapoetry.htm)

Recently in my contemporary poetry class, we were
discussing intermedial art, concentrating on visual
poetry. This got me wondering: has anyone explored the
aesthetic possibilities of sign-language as poetry?
Such a poetry would no doubt intersect with dance,
performance poetry, kinetic poetry of different
stripes, and visual poetry. Do you know of anyone
working in this area? Keep in mind, I don't mean
translations of poetry into sign-language, or even
poems that are composed in sign-language but, when
translated back into, say, English, resemble
conventional poetry. I mean a poetry whose aesthetic
effect depends on its embodiment as signed language,
where, for instance, the movement of the hands and
fingers are crucial to the poem's aesthetic effect,
where words might "rhyme" if they are signed
similarly, as opposed to sounding similar.

Thanks,
Joseph

Jim Cohn founded Bird's Brain Society, an all Deaf poetry performance =
series, and also put together a National Deaf Poetry Conference =
celebrating ASL "poetic intelligence." When I saw the troup in =
performance a number of years ago they were awesome, utterly pushing the =
margins of poetic convention. An early book of his is "Prarie Falcon =
[North Atlantic Books, 1989]." JL

Joseph,

See the current issue of Slope (www.slope.org), a special issue on ASL
poets. There are several poets not featured there who also work in/with ASL.
Dirksen Bauman at Gallaudet can probably help you more with this.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Last Thursday=E2=80=99s evening at The Poets House was fantastic. Just to gi=
ve a=20
sense of the flavor of the evening and the importance of Brecht as a poet, l=
et me=20
quote a few things. They dovetail beautifully with themes the list have been=
=20
concerned with the last few weeks:

I.=20

QUOTATION

The poet Kin said:
how am I to write immortal works if I am not famous?
How am I to answer if I am not asked?
Why should I waste time on verses if they will waste away=20
            with time?
I write my suggestions in a durable language
Since I fear it will be some time till they are carried out.
To achieve a great goal, great changes are required.
Little changes are the enemies of great changes
I have enemies. Therefore I must be famous.

               (Bertolt Brecht, trans. by Michael Morley)

I was going to, but I forgot to ask Michael Morley. Does =E2=80=9Cmust=E2=
=80=9D in the last=20
line mean =E2=80=9Cneed to be=E2=80=9D or does it mean =E2=80=9Cshould be=
=E2=80=9D (in the syllogistic=20
sense)? Is the ambiguity in the original German or is it accidentally create=
d in=20
English, with or without Michael=E2=80=99s awareness? To me, that =E2=80=9Cm=
ust=E2=80=9D is so=20
disorienting and in some way so Brechtian, touching something in Brecht=E2=
=80=99s character=20
all four speakers directly or indirectly referred to. If =E2=80=9Cmust=E2=
=80=9D means =E2=80=9Cneed to,=E2=80=9D
 then Brecht is saying fame (or recognition) is an integral part of writing=20
poetry.

But if =E2=80=9Cmust=E2=80=9D means =E2=80=9Cshould,=E2=80=9D then the argum=
ent of the poem is that a poet=20
can only be recognized by the anger (even hate) he arouses.

All through the poem,   Kin (the poet) is asking why write poetry, how to=20
write poetry when no one asks for it, or hears it, at least for a time? Then=
, to=20
me, the most startling line of the poem occurs, =E2=80=9CTo achieve a great=20=
goal,=20
great changes are required.=E2=80=9DIn other words, a great poem creates cha=
nges.=20
Therefore, the most a poet can hope for is =E2=80=9Chatred.=E2=80=9D He =E2=
=80=9Cmust be famous=E2=80=9D because he=20
has enemies. =E2=80=9CQuotation=E2=80=9D has the withering and raw elegance=20=
of a Shakesperean=20
sonnet.

Michael Morley said Brecht=E2=80=99s poetry embodies the issue of =E2=80=9Cb=
eing a poet=20
without being a poet.=E2=80=9D At least indirectly, three of the speakers ac=
knowledged=20
Brecht=E2=80=99s opportunism and careerism (the gentle word was =E2=80=9Csur=
vival=E2=80=9Dor =E2=80=9Ccomplex=E2=80=9D=20
or the Joycean phrase Anselm Hallo used, =E2=80=9Ccunning and silence,=E2=
=80=9D all true).=20
After leaving the States after being questioned by the congress, for instanc=
e,=20
Brecht parlayed himself into the directorship of the East German theatre. Bu=
t=20
Brecht did not seem to have used his poetry the same way (that was Michael=20
Morley=E2=80=99s point). It seems that Brecht saw a gap between the writing=20=
of a poem and=20
a contamperaneous audience, that it did not exist or at least that it took=20
time to come to being. That the only relation a poet can have to the audienc=
e is=20
antagonism, =E2=80=9CLittle changes are enemies of great changes.=E2=80=9D

Brecht popints to the distincion between audience and society, that they are=
=20
not the same. Brecht writes for society and believes in the social efficacy=20=
of=20
what he writes. But he writes =E2=80=9Cwithout being asked ... verses that [=
may]=20
waste away.=E2=80=9D=20

On this list, I have said that the American poetry must be/is written in=20
silence and against silence. The writing process is inherently split from it=
s=20
becoming part of the culture. These two aspects in fact work against each ot=
her.=20
The assertion may seem counter-intuitive or patently wrong within an America=
n=20
framework, particularly of the last twenty years, where language is turned i=
nto=20
a prison a flight out of which is impossible. But if one looks beyond, from=20=
a=20
less imperial perspective, conceiving such a split is freeing. Brecht is one=
=20
of the poets who can help us do that.


II) Anselm Hallo discussed Brecht=E2=80=99s idea of =E2=80=9Cgestus.=E2=80=
=9D Here is what Brecht=20
says on =E2=80=9Cgestus=E2=80=9D in poetry, a passage Anselm quotes:

=E2=80=9CSometimes on publishing unrhymed verse I was asked how on earth I c=
ould=20
present such stuff as verse [....] It is a fair question, as it is usual for=
 verse=20
  which does without rhyme to offer at least a solid rhythm. The reason I=20
give for labelling them verse is that they display a kind of (shifting,=20
syncopated, gestic) rhythm, even if not a regular one. [....] It must be rem=
embered=20
that the bulk of my work was designed for the theatre; I was always thinking=
 of=20
actual delivery. And for this delivery (whether of prose or of verse) I had=20
worked out a quite definite technique. I called it =E2=80=98gestic.=E2=80=
=99 This meant that the=20
sentence must entirely follow the gest(us) of the person speaking. This mean=
t=20
that the sentence must entirely follow the gest(us) of the person speaking..=
..
=E2=80=99
               --- Brecht, On Rhymeless Verse with Irregular Rhythms

Anselm Hallo read the following Brecht poem. Here is a part of it:

ON THE JOY OF BEGINNING

O joy of beginning! O early morning!
The first grass, when it seems we=E2=80=99ve forgotten
What green looks like! O first page of the book
Long awaited, the very surprising first page! Read
Slowly, all too soon
The unread part becomes too thin!. And the first splash of water
On the sweaty face! The fresh
Cool shirt! O beginning of love! Glance that strays away!
O the beginning of work...
...
          Bertolt Brecht, trans. by Anselm Hallo

Starting with the fourth line the line breaks transform the caesuraed=20
elegance of the first lines into a series of gestures -gestures of the soul-=
 gestus.=20
Words syntactically peripheral, =E2=80=9Cfirst,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Clong,=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=9Ctoo,=E2=80=9D are stressed=20
(syncopated on) -a radical interiority created, while the poem remaining obj=
ective,=20
flat. A poetry of gestures, both theatrical and of the spirit.

=E2=80=9CEda,=E2=80=9D which is the central poetics in my upcoming anthology=
, =E2=80=9CEda: an=20
Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry,=E2=80=9Dexplores a similar idea=20=
=E2=80=93a poetry of=20
cadences, rather than syntax, a poetry located in the space cadence opens am=
ong=20
words. Both =E2=80=9Ceda=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cgestus=E2=80=9D derive from t=
he possibilities declension gives=20
to a language, a quality which has disappeared in English the last three=20
centuries, along with it a range of expression. That is the significance of=20=
a=20
concept like =E2=80=9Cgestus=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Ceda=E2=80=9D at the moment=
.=20

Brecht connects =E2=80=9Cgest(us) to the theatre. But as =E2=80=9Cgaze=E2=
=80=9D (the eye, the primal=20
organ of gesture), it is also linked to photography and film. Goddard=E2=80=
=99s =E2=80=9C
Histoire du Cinema=E2=80=9D and my =E2=80=9CA Peripheral space of Photograph=
y=E2=80=9D elaborate on this=20
point in detail. A question to ask: what is the visual element in gesture?=
=E2=80=9D


III.=20
Geoffrey O=E2=80=99Brien talked about the effect Brecht had on him in the ea=
rly=20
sixties, just before the explosion of the Sixties and Goddard and new cinema=
. He=20
played part of a recording of =E2=80=98mahagony(?)=E2=80=9D where the Americ=
an musical theatre=20
is transformed into a savage sound, both itself and a satirical, thrillingly=
=20
campy version of itself. He talked of the freeing effect on him of Brecht=
=E2=80=99s=20
flatness.

Both Geoffrey and I share an intense love of movies. I love his interest in=20
the minutae of movies. For instance, how a cowboy drinking water with his ha=
nd=20
from the river has become part of our common dream consciousness. The weeken=
d=20
before the Thursday I happened to have watched Fassbinder=E2=80=99s =E2=80=
=9CThe American=20
Soldier.=E2=80=9D I told Geoffrey how Brechtian it was. He agreed and kicked=
 himself for=20
not bringing Fassbinder up in his talk. What is Brechtian in Fassbinder=E2=
=80=99s=20
movie? First, the mixture of love for and a caustic satire of the American=20
culture. I am surprised to realize how much an America of the imagination pe=
rmeates=20
Brecht=E2=80=99s work =E2=80=93the musical form, gangsters, the Chicago stoc=
kyards.=20

An interesting thing to me in Brecht is how alienation and love coexist. Is=20
that not the condition of many poets writing in English at the moment? =E2=
=80=9CGestus=E2=80=9D
 has an inner and a theatrical (outer) dimension. It is through the eye that=
=20
these two elements join, through gesture the soul becomes visible =E2=80=93a=
n ideal=20
transparence which Hamlet also tells the player to achieve.

In =E2=80=9CThe American Soldier,=E2=80=9D the main character, a hit man who=
 drives an=20
American car and eats steak and ketchup, lures himself into the bedroom of a=
 gay=20
man he is supposed to kill; the gay man is a gypsy who tells fortunes and se=
es=20
that the hitman does not have long to live. As the hitman enters the room, t=
he=20
other strips himself from the waist up, arching his back to show how=20
attractive he is. The hitman shoots him. How devestating, how simple, how=20
heartbreaking!=20

In an earlier scene, the hitman enters a bar and orders Ballantyne scotch. A=
=20
blond woman immediately starts singing a torch song in English in an atrocio=
us=20
accent. This almost ridiculous song is heartbreaking, a helpless gestus from=
=20
the soul. The girl is Inga, referred to before only once, someone the hit ma=
n=20
had a relations with years ago. They don=E2=80=99t talk. He leaves the bar.


IV.=20
Sonia Sanchez said her interest in Brecht began because the people she=20
respected, for example, Dubois, referred to him. I could not follow the rest=
 of her=20
argument too well. I was struck by an expression she repeatedly used: =E2=
=80=9CWhen I=20
taught in a place called San Fransisco State...,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhen I li=
ved in a place=20
called New York...,=E2=80=9D etc. I kept asking myself why she is not saying=
 =E2=80=9Cin San=20
Francisco State,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cin New York=E2=80=9D? Why this phrase of=20=
alienation repeated over=20
and over again?

Murat=20


=20

Thanks for that report, Murat.  The first play of Brecht's I read was Baal,
and maybe it still has a special place for me because of that.  I'm ashamed
to say that I've never seen Brecht performed, apart from a student
production of Lehrerstuck and a brilliant production in France of a
conflation of Fear and Misery in the Third Reich and The Wedding (at the
Theatre de la Commune last year).  He doesn't play big here: I don't think
any of our large theatres have done him, certainly not in my memory.  I
think that says a lot about theatre in Australia.  He became a bit embalmed
in English theatre, I think, the English Brecht tends to be a bit earnest,
inflected through Edward Bond, and earnestness is not something I associate
with Brecht.

I realise you're speaking of Brecht the poet, but Brecht the poet is
inseparable from Brecht the playwright, as that quotation confirms.  Gestus
is a theatrical word.  It means embodiment, muscle, physical energy, the
poetry of movement expressed in language.  Yes, it is communicated visually,
but perceived viscerally.

Brecht lives on in popular culture.  My kids were last night playing Tim
Burton's The Nightmare before Christmas (a movie they love).  Brilliant
theatre music, and a direct progeny of the Seven Deadly Sins and Mahagonny.
And there's the impact he's had on Tom Waits.  Brecht keeps popping up in
unexpected places, and will keep on doing that.

Best

Sarah Taub has done some wonderful work on iconicity, metaphor, and ASL
poetry. She is on linguistics faculty at Gallaudet,
http://linguistics.gallaudet.edu/taub.html

I also saw Phyllis Wilcox give a fascinating account of metaphor in an ASL
poem, but I don't know if it's ever been published. She's at U of New Mexico,

a text - constitutional, religious or even scientific.
Except that a text is without will. You then have to
put in place a 'basic will', along the lines of the
'basic norm', the voice, single or multiple, which
settles the matters on which the text is silent, in a
word, sovereignty with its essential attribute of

Hello Alison,
I'm feeling old...I saw "Mother Courage" (a memorable
Bob Daly newspaper set) at the Pram Factory in
Melbourne sometime in the 1970s..
A great production of "The Rise & Fall of the City of
Mahagonny" at the Sydney Opera House in the earlyish
1980s...
and a brilliant Michael-Kantor-directed "Causasian
Chalk Circle" (with the demented (in a positive sense)
Paul Capsis and others..)at Belvoir St Theatre in
Sydney in the late 1990s
So, by that reckoning, we must be due for something
Brechtian this decade.  Hope so,
Best wishes,
Pam Brown

Hi Pam

The Pram Factory was (just) before my time - one of the first pieces of
theatre I saw in Melbourne was its last production, a play about Oscar Wilde
by a Melbourne poet whose name escapes me. (Ron Evans?)

But it doesn't escape my attention that the rest were in Sydney.  I'm afraid
that I have Sydney envy at the moment; they're having all the fun.  It's all
Broadway musicals and keeping on smiling here, while the STC is doing what
sounds like a great production of my favourite Howard Barker play, Victory.
Not a chance of anything like that happening here.  And an upcoming season
at Belvoir St which sounds very interesting.

Ah well.

Best

A

Of Chalabi, Flags and Anthems...
There are two different kinds of strain. There's the physical strain of
carrying 40 pails of water up and down the stairs to fill the empty water
tank on the roof- after the 4th or 5th pail of water, you can literally see
your muscles quivering under your skin and without the bucket of water, you=
r
arms somehow feel weightless- almost nonexistent. Then there's mental
strain=8A that is when those forty buckets of water are being emptied in your
head and there's a huge flow of thoughts and emotions that threaten to
overwhelm you.=20
I think everyone I know is suffering from that mental strain. You can see i=
t
in the eyes and hear it in the taut voices that threaten to break with the
burden of emotion. We're all watching things carefully and trying to focus
on leading semi-normal lives all at once. The situation in the south seems
to be deteriorating and we hear of fresh new deaths every day. Fighting has
broken out in Falloojeh again and I'm not quite sure what has happened to
the ceasefire. It's hard to know just what is going on. There's a sense of
collective exhaustion in the air.
I've been reading articles about Chalabi being (very hopefully) on his way
out. I can't believe it took this long for Washington to come to the
conclusion that he is completely useless. Did anyone there actually believe
he was going to be greeted as the leader of a new era? We were watching him
carefully during the last few weeks, trying to see what he would do or say
during the attacks on Falloojeh and all the fighting in the south. That was
a crucial time=8A we were waiting for some reaction from the Puppets- any
reaction. Some condemning words=8A some solidarity with the Iraqis being
killed and left homeless and there was a strange sort of silence. One of
them threatened to step down, but that was only after outraged Iraqis showe=
d
an inclination to eat them alive if something wasn't done about the
situation=8A
Chalabi has only lately ventured out from under his rock (in the usual
flashy tie) to cry out that Lakhdhar Il Braheimi, the special UN
representative sent by Kofi to check out the possibility of elections, is
completely and totally biased against Shi'a. So now Chalabi seems to
consider himself a champion of Shi'a everywhere in Iraq. The amusing thing
about this is the fact that, apparently, no one has told Chalabi that he ha=
s
become the joke of the Shi'a community. We (Sunnis and Shi'a) tease each
other with things like, "So=8A the Shi'a man of the moment is Chalabi, ah?!"
and the phrase is usually received with an indignant outcry and a compariso=
n
of the man of the moment to=8A Britney Spears, for example.
I stare at him when he gives his speeches on television and cringe with the
thought that someone out there could actually have thought he was
representative of any faction of Iraqi society. I can hardly believe that h=
e
was supposed to be the one to target the Iraqi intellectuals and
secularists. He's the tasteless joke Bush and Co. sent along with the
soldiers and tanks to promote democracy- rather like one of those plastic
blowup dolls teenage boys practice dancing with before the prom.
I also heard today that the Puppets are changing the flag. It looks nothing
like the old one and at first I was angry and upset, but then I realized
that it wouldn't make a difference. The Puppets are illegitimate, hence
their constitution is null and void and their flag is theirs alone. It is a=
s
representative of Iraq as they are- it might as well have "Made in America"
stitched along the inside seam. It can be their flag and every time we see
it, we'll see Chalabi et al. against its pale white background.
My email buddy and fellow Iraqi S.A. in America said it best in her email,
"I am sure we are all terribly excited about the extreme significance of th=
e
adoption by the completely illegitimate Iraq Puppet Council of a new
national piece of garishly colored cloth. Of course the design of the new
national rag was approved by the always tastefully dressed self-declared
counter terrorism expert viceroy of Iraq, Paul Bremer, who is well known fo=
r
wearing expensive hand-stitched combat boots with thousand dollar custom
tailored suits and silk designer ties.
The next big piece of news will be the new pledge of allegiance to said
national rag, and the empire for which it stands. The American author of
said pledge has yet to be announced."
For the coming national anthem, may I suggest Chalabi, Allawi, Hakeem and
Talbani in a gaudy, Iraqi version of "Lady Marmalade"?=20

Hello all, it's been so long. My recent move to
australia has left me puckered and tropical,

I thought I'd share some recently finished critters.
And ask for your dearly held comments. They've been in
my brain too long and I need some ideas on changing or
not changing. Good or bad or nothing.

Thank you, Murat. Yes, there are influences everywhere,
many distilled (pop music), some powerful (poetry, film,
music, thinking... & theatre).

And I await your upcoming antology.

Cheers & Thanks for the sharing,
Jerry Schwartz

 Last Thursdayâ€™s evening at The Poets House was fantastic. Just to give a
sense of the flavor of the evening and the importance of Brecht as a poet,
let me
quote a few things. They dovetail beautifully with themes the list have been
concerned with the last few weeks:

I.

QUOTATION

The poet Kin said:
how am I to write immortal works if I am not famous?
How am I to answer if I am not asked?
Why should I waste time on verses if they will waste away
            with time?
I write my suggestions in a durable language
Since I fear it will be some time till they are carried out.
To achieve a great goal, great changes are required.
Little changes are the enemies of great changes
I have enemies. Therefore I must be famous.

               (Bertolt Brecht, trans. by Michael Morley)

I was going to, but I forgot to ask Michael Morley. Does â€œmustâ€ in the last
line mean â€œneed to beâ€ or does it mean â€œshould beâ€ (in the syllogistic
sense)? Is the ambiguity in the original German or is it accidentally
created in
English, with or without Michaelâ€™s awareness? To me, that â€œmustâ€ is so
disorienting and in some way so Brechtian, touching something in Brechtâ€™s
character
all four speakers directly or indirectly referred to. If â€œmustâ€ means â€œneed
to,â€
 then Brecht is saying fame (or recognition) is an integral part of writing
poetry.

But if â€œmustâ€ means â€œshould,â€ then the argument of the poem is that a poet
can only be recognized by the anger (even hate) he arouses.

All through the poem,   Kin (the poet) is asking why write poetry, how to
write poetry when no one asks for it, or hears it, at least for a time?
Then, to
me, the most startling line of the poem occurs, â€œTo achieve a great goal,
great changes are required.â€In other words, a great poem creates changes.
Therefore, the most a poet can hope for is â€œhatred.â€ He â€œmust be famousâ€
because he
has enemies. â€œQuotationâ€ has the withering and raw elegance of a
Shakesperean
sonnet.

Michael Morley said Brechtâ€™s poetry embodies the issue of â€œbeing a poet
without being a poet.â€ At least indirectly, three of the speakers
acknowledged
Brechtâ€™s opportunism and careerism (the gentle word was â€œsurvivalâ€or
â€œcomplexâ€
or the Joycean phrase Anselm Hallo used, â€œcunning and silence,â€ all true).
After leaving the States after being questioned by the congress, for
instance,
Brecht parlayed himself into the directorship of the East German theatre.
But
Brecht did not seem to have used his poetry the same way (that was Michael
Morleyâ€™s point). It seems that Brecht saw a gap between the writing of a
poem and
a contamperaneous audience, that it did not exist or at least that it took
time to come to being. That the only relation a poet can have to the
audience is
antagonism, â€œLittle changes are enemies of great changes.â€

Brecht popints to the distincion between audience and society, that they are
not the same. Brecht writes for society and believes in the social efficacy
of
what he writes. But he writes â€œwithout being asked ... verses that [may]
waste away.â€

On this list, I have said that the American poetry must be/is written in
silence and against silence. The writing process is inherently split from
its
becoming part of the culture. These two aspects in fact work against each
other.
The assertion may seem counter-intuitive or patently wrong within an
American
framework, particularly of the last twenty years, where language is turned
into
a prison a flight out of which is impossible. But if one looks beyond, from
a
less imperial perspective, conceiving such a split is freeing. Brecht is one
of the poets who can help us do that.


II) Anselm Hallo discussed Brechtâ€™s idea of â€œgestus.â€ Here is what Brecht
says on â€œgestusâ€ in poetry, a passage Anselm quotes:

â€œSometimes on publishing unrhymed verse I was asked how on earth I could
present such stuff as verse [....] It is a fair question, as it is usual for
verse
  which does without rhyme to offer at least a solid rhythm. The reason I
give for labelling them verse is that they display a kind of (shifting,
syncopated, gestic) rhythm, even if not a regular one. [....] It must be
remembered
that the bulk of my work was designed for the theatre; I was always thinking
of
actual delivery. And for this delivery (whether of prose or of verse) I had
worked out a quite definite technique. I called it â€˜gestic.â€™ This meant that
the
sentence must entirely follow the gest(us) of the person speaking. This
meant
that the sentence must entirely follow the gest(us) of the person
speaking....
â€™
               --- Brecht, On Rhymeless Verse with Irregular Rhythms

Anselm Hallo read the following Brecht poem. Here is a part of it:

ON THE JOY OF BEGINNING

O joy of beginning! O early morning!
The first grass, when it seems weâ€™ve forgotten
What green looks like! O first page of the book
Long awaited, the very surprising first page! Read
Slowly, all too soon
The unread part becomes too thin!. And the first splash of water
On the sweaty face! The fresh
Cool shirt! O beginning of love! Glance that strays away!
O the beginning of work...
...
          Bertolt Brecht, trans. by Anselm Hallo

Starting with the fourth line the line breaks transform the caesuraed
elegance of the first lines into a series of gestures -gestures of the soul-
gestus.
Words syntactically peripheral, â€œfirst,â€ â€œlong,â€ â€œtoo,â€ are stressed
(syncopated on) -a radical interiority created, while the poem remaining
objective,
flat. A poetry of gestures, both theatrical and of the spirit.

â€œEda,â€ which is the central poetics in my upcoming anthology, â€œEda: an
Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry,â€explores a similar idea â€“a poetry
of
cadences, rather than syntax, a poetry located in the space cadence opens
among
words. Both â€œedaâ€ and â€œgestusâ€ derive from the possibilities declension
gives
to a language, a quality which has disappeared in English the last three
centuries, along with it a range of expression. That is the significance of
a
concept like â€œgestusâ€ or â€œedaâ€ at the moment.

Brecht connects â€œgest(us) to the theatre. But as â€œgazeâ€ (the eye, the primal
organ of gesture), it is also linked to photography and film. Goddardâ€™s â€œ
Histoire du Cinemaâ€ and my â€œA Peripheral space of Photographyâ€ elaborate on
this
point in detail. A question to ask: what is the visual element in gesture?â€


III.
Geoffrey Oâ€™Brien talked about the effect Brecht had on him in the early
sixties, just before the explosion of the Sixties and Goddard and new
cinema. He
played part of a recording of â€˜mahagony(?)â€ where the American musical
theatre
is transformed into a savage sound, both itself and a satirical, thrillingly
campy version of itself. He talked of the freeing effect on him of Brechtâ€™s
flatness.

Both Geoffrey and I share an intense love of movies. I love his interest in
the minutae of movies. For instance, how a cowboy drinking water with his
hand
from the river has become part of our common dream consciousness. The
weekend
before the Thursday I happened to have watched Fassbinderâ€™s â€œThe American
Soldier.â€ I told Geoffrey how Brechtian it was. He agreed and kicked himself
for
not bringing Fassbinder up in his talk. What is Brechtian in Fassbinderâ€™s
movie? First, the mixture of love for and a caustic satire of the American
culture. I am surprised to realize how much an America of the imagination
permeates
Brechtâ€™s work â€“the musical form, gangsters, the Chicago stockyards.

An interesting thing to me in Brecht is how alienation and love coexist. Is
that not the condition of many poets writing in English at the moment?
â€œGestusâ€
 has an inner and a theatrical (outer) dimension. It is through the eye that
these two elements join, through gesture the soul becomes visible â€“an ideal
transparence which Hamlet also tells the player to achieve.

In â€œThe American Soldier,â€ the main character, a hit man who drives an
American car and eats steak and ketchup, lures himself into the bedroom of a
gay
man he is supposed to kill; the gay man is a gypsy who tells fortunes and
sees
that the hitman does not have long to live. As the hitman enters the room,
the
other strips himself from the waist up, arching his back to show how
attractive he is. The hitman shoots him. How devestating, how simple, how
heartbreaking!

In an earlier scene, the hitman enters a bar and orders Ballantyne scotch. A
blond woman immediately starts singing a torch song in English in an
atrocious
accent. This almost ridiculous song is heartbreaking, a helpless gestus from
the soul. The girl is Inga, referred to before only once, someone the hit
man
had a relations with years ago. They donâ€™t talk. He leaves the bar.


IV.
Sonia Sanchez said her interest in Brecht began because the people she
respected, for example, Dubois, referred to him. I could not follow the rest
of her
argument too well. I was struck by an expression she repeatedly used: â€œWhen
I
taught in a place called San Fransisco State...,â€ â€œWhen I lived in a place
called New York...,â€ etc. I kept asking myself why she is not saying â€œin San
Francisco State,â€ â€œin New Yorkâ€? Why this phrase of alienation repeated over
and over again?

"blues are the colour, the sound of our times.  and these are indeed
some of the bluest times the world has as yet witnessed.  blues announce
everything.  twisters, earthquakes, mudslides, avalanches, hurricanes,
and real WAR for imaginary weapons.  and who's sane? caught. 10,000
suspected SARS civet cats destroyed.  400 mad cows slaughtered.
homeland security: low (green), guarded (blue), elevated (yellow), high
(orange), severe (red).  colours, like sound, emit certain vibrations.
so even shadows cast a blue light.

gathered among this issue's pages is an attempt to chart a trajectory of
"the blues" by way of the "blues."  the sound began with colour and
lightning still strikes a transcendant chord.  we traveling still.  this
work reveals us one inside the other. the spit the grit   the funk  the
flesh.  an act of grace."

greetings,

I';m not sure how many of you out there know about the new tory government
in Newfoundland's decision to postpone the opening of a $47 million
building that will house the provincial museum, archive, and art gallery.
The Rooms (named after traditional buildings from the province's 400 year
fishing history) was slated to open in June. The government says that the
postponement will save $2 million.

One of the many ironies of this is that the government awarded $1 million
for tourism initiatives. One of the many reasons people want to come here
is because of the island's culture and distinct hertitage.

I'm usually not one for these on-line petitions but I'll point you to one
anyway.

 http://www.petitiononline.com/therooms/petition.html

A group has formed calling itself Coalition of Mad Artists (COMA) to
spread awareness about the issue. Here is a report on a demo held last
week-end. There are links at the bottom of the story for more background

thanks,kevin

Artists protest delayed opening of The Rooms
Last Updated Mon, 26 Apr 2004
http://www.cbc.ca/arts/stories/roomsprotest20040426

CBC News Online with files from Suzanne Woolridge, The Arts Report


The Rooms in St. John`s will now open a year later than planned.

ST. JOHN'S, NFLD. - More than 300 artists and arts supporters protested in
St. John's Saturday, calling the Newfoundland and Labrador government's
decision to delay the opening of an already completed new arts complex an
attempt to "deaden the arts."

The Rooms -- a dramatic new building that dominates the downtown skyline
of St. John's -- was designed to hold the provincial art gallery, archives
and museum. The $47-million complex was scheduled to open this June.
During its March budget announcement, however, the province announced it
was postponing the opening by a year, saying that delaying the move to the
new building would save $2 million.

"It's the government that's in a coma. It's the government that's trying
to deaden the arts," said Isabella St. John, a member of a group called
the Coalition of Mad Artists (or COMA), which organized Saturday's
demonstration.

"But as you can see here, it's not going to happen," she said of the noisy
protest.

Because of the delay, the provincial museum and archives must return to
their former buildings, unpack and hastily mount last-minute exhibits.

The art gallery, however, has already been closed for a year, readying its
collection for the transition to the new space. Because it has nowhere to
go, it will likely remain closed, leaving Newfoundland as the only
province with no provincial gallery.

"[The delay] sends the message to the international cultural community
that this province does not value art or its artists," Susie Taylor, chair
of the Eastern Edge Gallery's board, said in late March.

"If Newfoundland and Labrador artists and arts professionals are held at
such low esteem by government, there is no incentive for them to stay
here. What this building represented is public access to art. We are now a
province without that."

The arts community feels shortchanged by the province, says fine art
photographer Terrene Hounsel.

"We are one of the most artistic people in the country and if we can't
have The Rooms open, who in heck can?" Housel asked.

The coalition is urging arts supporters across the country to continue
sending letters and emails to the Newfoundland government in support of
opening The Rooms and it vows to hold more public protests until the issue
is resolved.

Hubert Selby Jr. Dies at 75; Wrote `Last Exit to Brooklyn'
By ANTHONY DePALMA

Hubert Selby Jr., the Brooklyn-born ex-merchant mariner who turned to
drugs and to writing after cheating death and created a lasting vision
of urban hell in his novel "Last Exit to Brooklyn," died yesterday at
his home in Los Angeles. He was 75.

The cause was chronic pulmonary disease, said his son, Bill Selby, who
added that his father's death was the long-term consequence of the
tuberculosis he had contracted while at sea during World War II.

Mr. Selby had no formal training, and disdained the prim order of
punctuation and plot. His writing was spare and direct. But what most
marked his work was the stark despair and loneliness he described in
such shocking terms that some of his work was blocked for a time in the
United States, and later England, as obscene.

He said he did not understand what the fuss was about.

"The events that take place are the way people are," he said in an
interview with The New York Times in 1988, describing the gang rapes,
brutal beatings and countless perversions described in "Last Exit."
"These are not literary characters; these are real people. I knew these
people. How can anybody look inside themselves and be surprised at the
hatred and violence in the world? It's inside all of us."

"Tralala," one of the stories that make up the book, was the subject of
an obscenity trial involving The Provincetown Review, which published it
in 1961. And when "Last Exit," which consists of "Tralala" and five
other loosely connected stories, was published in England in 1966, a
jury found it to be obscene and fined its publisher.

The novel describes the seedy underbelly of the Red Hook waterfront
neighborhood in the Brooklyn of the 1950's, which is depicted as a
wasteland prowled by gangs, whores and transvestites. When it was
published by Grove Press in 1964, its repulsive language and
blast-furnace images made the novel difficult either to accept or
reject.

"This is a brutal book - shocking, exhausting, depressing," wrote Eliot
Fremont-Smith in the first review of the book in The Times. Yet, despite
the gutter language and obscene grunts of the dark characters in the
novel, Mr. Fremont-Smith said that the book could not be easily
dismissed. "The profound depression it causes - once one starts
seriously to read it - is a measure of an authentic power which carries
through and beyond revulsion," he wrote. "Just who should be asked to
undergo this experience is another matter."

Hubert Selby Jr. was born on July 27, 1928, in Brooklyn, the son of
Adalin and Hubert Selby Sr., a coal miner from Kentucky who served in
the merchant marine for several years until his son was born. During
World War II the senior Mr. Selby returned to the merchant marine. His
son, though underage, convinced the recruiters he was old enough to join
as well. While at sea he developed tuberculosis. After going through
radical surgery and more than a year of hospitalization, he was given no
chance of recovery.

He did recover, but was hooked on the morphine he had received during
his hospitalization. He started drinking. With no other prospects, he
decided to try writing, although he once said he had never read anything
until he was an adult. While he wrote the stories that went into "Last
Exit to Brooklyn" he worked for a time as an insurance analyst in
Manhattan.

Before the book was published in 1964, Mr. Selby's writing had earned
him less than $100. Despite its bleakness, the book's underlying message
of redemption through self-destruction caught on in a United States
about to enter the radical 1960's.

Mr. Selby overcame his addictions and moved to the West Coast, where he
wrote several other books, including "The Room" (1971) "The Demon"
(1976), and "The Willow Tree" (1998). In 1989 "Last Exit" was made into
a film by the German director Uli Edel.

Hubert Selby Jr. was married three times, most recently in 1969 to
Suzanne Victoria Selby, who survives him, along with four children:
Claudia Adams of Marrow Bone, Ky.; Kyle, of Yorktown, N.Y.; Rachel Kuehn
of Corona, Calif.; and Bill, of Loma Linda, Calif.

At the time of his death, Mr. Selby, a high school dropout, taught a
graduate writing class at the University of Southern California. His son
Bill Selby said he was also working on a novel and a screenplay.

stellar. The info again:

Eastern Washington teen's sketches attract Secret Service scrutiny
By The Associated Press

PROSSER, Benton County - Secret Service agents questioned a high-school student here about anti-war drawings he turned in to his art
teacher.
One of them depicted President Bush's head on a stick.
Another pencil-and-ink drawing depicted Bush as a devil launching a missile, with a caption reading "End the war - on terrorism."
The 15-year-old boy's art teacher turned the drawings over to school administrators, who notified a police officer assigned to work
with the school.
"We involve the police anytime we have a concern," Prosser Superintendent Ray Tolcacher told the Tri-City Herald.
"From our perspective, it was an incident that needed to be reported to the police on campus."
Secret Service agents interviewed the boy Friday. The student, who was not arrested, has not been identified.
The school district disciplined him, but district officials declined to say what the punishment was. Tolcacher said the boy was not
suspended. Tolcacher insisted it was not a freedom-of-speech issue but a concern over the depiction of violence.
"From what I saw, (school officials) were right to be concerned," Prosser Police Chief Win Taylor said.
The artwork was apparently part of an assignment to keep a notebook of drawings, according to Kevin Cravens of Richland, who said he
was a family friend of the boy who was investigated.
The drawing that drew the most attention showed a man in what appeared to be Middle Eastern-style clothing, holding a rifle. He also
was holding a stick with the oversize head of President Bush on it. The student said the head was enlarged because it was intended
to be an effigy, Cravens said. The caption called for an end to the war in Iraq.
The boy's mother declined to talk with The Seattle Times last night. The Secret Service did not return the Herald's calls for
comment, and a message left by The Associated Press with an after-hours duty officer in Washington, D.C., was not immediately
returned yesterday.
"If this 15-year-old kid in Prosser is perceived as a threat to the president, then we are living in '1984.' " Cravens said.
Seattle Times staff reporter Nguyen Huy Vu contributed to this report.

"Please Help"

I've been sick for months
as a result of following--
/following/ the instructions of others
on how best to treat my illness.

It all began with intense headaches
around half a year ago,
and since then has progressed
from general malaise to tremors
and feelings of something
crawling within my bones.

I think this may possibly--
/possibly/ be associated
with my use of an anti-thought control device
that I purchased on the Internet
and an unknown interaction with ELF
that seems to pass
through my bedroom on cold nights.

My ears itch, my hands ache,
and my eyelashes have all fallen out.

I have sought advice from doctors
and also on the Internet,
message boards, IRC and USENET.

Someone told me I should take angelica root
and slit the skin on my arm
and insert a one-inch piece of root into the wound.

I tried this several times,
and gave up the last time
after an infestation of worms developed.

"Gargle with a tincture"--
/Gargle with a tincture/
another person told me--
"Fix somatic problems
with sewage oxtail stew"--
but I couldn't stomach the flavor
more than a few days.

It seems that the negative aspects
of this preparation
become more pronounced over time.

For two weeks after this,
I had blurred vision
and a taste of aluminum foil
was strong against my tonsils.

I also tried extracting my tonsils
with a sharpened wooden spoon,
thinking that they might be infected
with extraterrestrial microbes.

Massive bleeding resulted in a visit to the ER.

I don't trust the doctors there.

I'm not sure what they might have done
while I was unconscious.

Any help in addressing my situation
is greatly appreciated.

/--Brent Bechtel/

I find this CNN report profoundly scary. There are clearly forces acting to
take over and repress the right to expression, particularly, in this case,
political art work created in an art class in a high school. (There was
another similar  incident recently in a writing program at San Francisco's
Academy of Art.) In both cases the "reporting" teachers appear to act on
their own as willing instruments of state repression (suppression?).

" Secret Service agents interviewed the boy Friday. The student, who was not
arrested, has not been identified. The school district disciplined him, but
district officials declined to say  what the punishment was." (!!!) (!)

When I read this stuff, I think - collectively, as writers and artists -
that it's time for an immediate art revolt. Say, wouldn't it be nice to
choose a day in May where every teacher of art and writing, and every writer
and artist in this country will make an openly political work of art that in
one way or other depicts and interprets our various "state managers" - be
that Bush, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Tenet, etc. etc.  And then post the work all
over the internet, as well as print it out and post it in what remains of
public space (post office boxes, school , telephone poles, sidewalks, etc.,
etc., including public readings, in schools as well)

A reclamation and exercise of free speech and the right of art and language
to occupy and participate in public space.

A resurrection of the energy that led huge numbers of us to both
demonstrate, make creative placards and read poems against going to war in
Iraq. This time bringing it home to fight those forces bent on occupying our
own country, ones that are clearly intent on using the State and Government
(including its schools) as the means to repress creative political work,
discourse, & debate.

Loathe the image of somebody from the Secret Service tapping yourself or
your child or student on the shoulder? Or Rumsfeld as the poet laureate of
the current war?

It seems to me strong time to start walking that walk (demonstrating), soon.

Hopefully many people will begin (again) to take the lead here. It's getting
hard to hold in so much disgust,anger, etc.

Brent,
Delighted to be of service
Yours is quite a common ailment=20

only the young at mind,

I recommend a multi-phased=20

get naked
take no root
get cynical
talk only to deaf musicians
they feel
learn to play
yourself

get naked fast
get cynical faster...try time-warping.

Alex=20
P.S.=20
If all else fails
vote republican. =20
That vote won't cure your ills
but pain from the error of your ways
may take your mind off trivial ailments.=20

  "Please Help"

  I've been sick for months
  as a result of following--
  /following/ the instructions of others
  on how best to treat my illness.

  It all began with intense headaches
  around half a year ago,
  and since then has progressed
  from general malaise to tremors
  and feelings of something
  crawling within my bones.

  I think this may possibly--
  /possibly/ be associated
  with my use of an anti-thought control device
  that I purchased on the Internet
  and an unknown interaction with ELF
  that seems to pass
  through my bedroom on cold nights.

  My ears itch, my hands ache,
  and my eyelashes have all fallen out.

  I have sought advice from doctors
  and also on the Internet,
  message boards, IRC and USENET.

  Someone told me I should take angelica root
  and slit the skin on my arm
  and insert a one-inch piece of root into the wound.

  I tried this several times,
  and gave up the last time
  after an infestation of worms developed.

  "Gargle with a tincture"--
  /Gargle with a tincture/
  another person told me--
  "Fix somatic problems
  with sewage oxtail stew"--
  but I couldn't stomach the flavor
  more than a few days.

  It seems that the negative aspects
  of this preparation
  become more pronounced over time.

  For two weeks after this,
  I had blurred vision
  and a taste of aluminum foil
  was strong against my tonsils.

  I also tried extracting my tonsils
  with a sharpened wooden spoon,
  thinking that they might be infected
  with extraterrestrial microbes.

  Massive bleeding resulted in a visit to the ER.

  I don't trust the doctors there.

  I'm not sure what they might have done
  while I was unconscious.

  Any help in addressing my situation
  is greatly appreciated.

Hello again Alison,
My tickets to "Victory" arrived in today's mail. It's
so popular, being Judy Davis's return to the stage
after a 12 year break, plus Colin Friels who's a
wonderful theatre actor (much better than in film or
tv)as you would know...so popular that the long six
week season practically sold out in the first few days
- I could only get seats at a mid-week matinee at
12.30pm in June !!...a-mazing - hope I remember to go
by the time June rolls around...

Pam, I'm soooo JEALOUS.  I have wanted to see that play for years... Maybe
it might come to Melbourne?  I suppose Simon down the MTC would think it too
savage and difficult for his blue-rinse subscribers.  I could weep.

It's certainly a play for our times.

Btw, watch out for Colin Friels in the performance of his life in a film out
later this year called Tom White...completely astounding -

Cheers

Poets Kirsten Kaschock and William D. Waltz will read from their work at =
the Lost Dog Lounge on Thursday, April 29 at 7:00 p.m.
during an Ithaca stop on the Slope Editions book tour. Free. Ithaca, NY.

Zoo Music marks another step in the Minneapolis Renaissance -- William =
Waltz's book, like those of his Twin Cities peers, storms over the =
American poetic landscape at the right time, sweeping aside today's =
tired ultra-irony and hyper-humor in favor of ineffable strangeness and =
touching sincerity. A zebra of different stripes. Chosen by Dean Young =
as Winner of the Second Annual Slope Editions Book Prize. William Waltz =
grew up in Wapakoneta, Ohio, home of the first man on the moon. He =
earned a B.A. in Economics from Ohio State University and a M.F.A. in =
Poetry from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His poems have =
appeared such journals as Denver Quarterly, Exquisite Corpse, Forklift =
Ohio, Insurance, Lit, Poetry East, Spinning Jenny, Surgery of Modern =
Warfare and Verse. He lives and works in Minneapolis with his wife Brett =
Astor and their daughter Clark Mercy. He is the editor of Conduit.

"As I get closer with my weapons," writes Kirsten Kaschock, the rules =
change -- the rules regarding how we must look at the body and spirit. A =
poet and choreographer, Kaschock uses language and the dance thereof to =
mount her attack. Using cities as metaphorical backdrops, the result is =
a voyage into the streets and arteries of various physical and psychic =
terrains. Kirsten Kaschock was born into a family of dancers. She has =
earned MFAs in both choreography from the University of Iowa and in =
creative writing from Syracuse University. Her poetic work has appeared =
in journals including The Iowa Review, Indiana Review, Pleiades, LIT, =
Barrow Street, Hayden's Ferry Review and American Letters & Commentary. =
She is currently relocating from Syracuse, New York, to Suwannee, =
Georgia, with her husband and two children in order to pursue a Ph.D.

DIFFERENCE IS A STRATEGY

"We believe in no one "school" of poetry; we subscribe to no one poetic =
"mode" or "sensibility." We seek innovative, moving and daring work. =
Apart from their high quality content, Slope Editions books are =
recognizable for the high quality of their design. And, like our =
readership, we're not afraid of the Web: we believe the Internet is the =
best place to promote the writing of today, and the most convenient =
place for our audience to access and buy our authors' work." =

Elegy for Thom Gunn (1929-2004)/ by Todd Swift

=20

You moved between worlds,

As a god to men does, who

Puts on the used-clothes of

A swan, to beat about girls;

=20

Crossed channels, a motion

In the very style you took on;

Became a pop star of form,

Reformed the common, into

=20

Something rare.  Jacketed

Muscle and passion, a uniform

Uniquely yours.  Revved

Engines, made language

=20

A throttle that could roar

With poise and sexuality

And remorse, for loss.  Tossed

Love and its deadliness out

=20

As the first ball of the game;

In and out of season, came

And then were able to write

About it, with ease, intellect,

=20

Control, but freely, like a stone

That takes, as it rolls, moss

And other earthly bric-a-

Brac with it, to compose

=20

A song in the movement of

Its going; hurtled most, talent

Calm, loins ruffled, Fulke

Greville like a sock in your jeans;

=20

Tested the means, renamed

The terms, conditions, of renewal.

Became a sort of rocket fuel

For poems that, changed, from sea

=20

To sea, from Atlantic to Pacific,

Shone with American grandeur,

Retained British propriety - hard

To do when boss of desire's realm;

=20

When speeding down lines

Wearing flesh's delicate helmet

For radical protection.  Fallen,

As all captains are, sadly, last-reel

=20

Come up on the high screen, at

The drive-in where your Wild Ones

Would have been, acting out,

Tough and languorous with beauty

=20

Only men under twenty-five can

Display - you are, with precision,

Forever as alive as Whitman, Gray:

One of those who mastered the elegy

=20

And the ecstasy of living, in one pose;

the experimenter's regress


The first thing to notice is that the machine is to mimic a man who is =
imitating a woman
-not a man being himself. The second thing to notice is that the machine =
is to mimic 1950
whoich is imitating an intwinnement -not a 'time-being' itself.

As I was touring Semipalatinsk in the Spring of that year, I had =
fashioned an instrument from
a 'kit' I had received from an address I had recorded in my notebook =
upon waking from a dream.
There was also a small fat plastic pillow full of a phosphorescent =
powder which I was instructed to ingest
after I had made the object which I laid upon my head, which I did. I =
must have passed out. Because when I
came to, or woke up, the object was gone, and in the darkness of the =
bathroom, as I stood there peeing,
looking at myself in the mirror, I saw that the rims of my eyelids were =
glowing yellowgreen, like some kind
of anti-kohl. That's when I noticed I could time travel; -like a tiny =
drop of urine I slipped out of myself and fell blissfully
wobbling backwards. There I was in a desert, naked, with a grey foam =
doughnut which had somehow
grown from my midsection, around my waist. In the distance, I saw what =
looked like a terra cotta city.
A voice chimed gently in my ear, "protocol h/m, proceed freely.." "What =
is this thing around my waist?"
"A rest of behavior," said the voice. It felt like wet food. I was =
hungry. The desert seemed oceanic.

Thom Gunn, 74, Poet Who Left Tradition for the Counterculture, Dies
By WOLFGANG SAXON


Thom Gunn, a transplanted British poet identified with the San
Francisco scene and the California liberated style, died on Sunday
night at his home in San Francisco, his adopted hometown. He was 74.

His death was announced by his companion of 52 years, Mike Kitay.

Acclaimed as one of the most promising young poets of postwar Britain,
Mr. Gunn found his own voice after he migrated to California in the
1950's and established himself in San Francisco, his home for the rest
of his life. There, he wedded traditional form to unorthodox themes
like LSD, panhandling and homosexuality. He experimented with free
verse and syllabic stanzas. In doing so he evolved from British
tradition and European existentialism to embrace the relaxed ways of
the California counterculture.

Born and educated in England, he was grouped as a young man at
Cambridge in the 1950's with a generation of writers, notably Philip
Larkin, known as the Movement. Their verse was celebrated for its dry,
skeptical rejection of what they saw as rhymed grandiosity.

He later studied at Stanford with the poetic rationalist Yvor Winters.
By the time his best-known early collection, "My Sad Captain," appeared
in 1961, Mr. Gunn had settled in America.

  His work was honored on both sides of the Atlantic. He won a
Guggenheim fellowship in 1971 and was chosen as a MacArthur fellow in
1993.

"The Man With Night Sweats" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux; 1992) was his
characteristically unsentimental vision of the AIDS epidemic in San
Francisco, and a stark tribute to the friends he lost to it. The poem
began:

I wake up cold, I who

Prospered through dreams of heat

  Wake to their residue,

  Sweat, and a clinging sheet.

  My flesh was its own shield:

  Where it was gashed, it healed.

I grew as I explored

  The body I could trust

  Even while I adored

The risk that made robust,

A world of wonders in

Each challenge to the skin.

For that work he was given the Forward Prize for Best Poet of the Year
and the Lenore Marshall/Nation Poetry Prize.

He received the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Poetry in 1995 and
the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest award for his collected poems. That
volume, "Collected Poems" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1994), represented
a harvest of 40 years of his work. Like "The Man With Night Sweats," it
remains in print.

The poet Richard Tillinghast, reviewing the collection for The New York
Times Book Review, wrote:

"Among other things, this lucid, very readable book may partly be
approached as a personal history of the gay scene in San Francisco,
from its early beginnings to the counterculture to its Castro Street
flowering, and finally to the age of AIDS.

"Characteristically Mr. Gunn brings to demotic experience the classical
clarity of his finely honed meter and incisive rhymes."

Thomson William Gunn was born in Gravesend, Kent, to journalist parents
who divorced when he was 9. He moved about with his father, Herbert
Smith Gunn, until they eventually settled in Hampshire.

After spending two years in military service and six months in Paris,
he enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge. By that time he had finished
three novels, none of which was ever published.

He wrote his first poem for a student magazine, and its success
prompted him to adopt that medium to express himself. The choice was
partly influenced by his readings of Stendhal, Baudelaire and Sartre.

Mr. Gunn graduated fom Cambridge in 1953 and published "Fighting
Terms," which identified him with the Movement, in 1954. The same year
he began his graduate studies with Winters at Stanford and decided to
become a resident of California.

He soon started teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, as
a lecturer. He was an associate professor of English from 1958 to 1966,
after which he conducted classes as a visiting and, later, senior
lecturer until four years ago.

Besides Mr. Kitay, Mr. Gunn is survived by his younger brother, Ander
Gunn, of Penzance, England.

And of course, there's more to be said from outside a U=2ES=2E perspective=

Rampike magazine, out of Ontario, I remember used to include quite a bit o=

Less knowledge of Central and South American writers, but I'm sure someone=

here can help=2E

Hey Folks-Can anyone recommend any particularly cogent prose critiques of
traditional lyric poetry?  Certainly, much contemporary poetry is written,
in one way or another, against such poetry, but I'm interested, for
teaching purposes, in digging up essays that make explicit, political
critiques of the assumptions and practices of conventional lyric poetry.
And along similar lines, I'd be interested in critiques of "nature poetry"
as well.
Thanks,
Steve

Steve:

not sure if it's exactly a right fit, but there's Eliot Weinberger's "What
Was Formalism?", a review of the New Formalist anthology Rebel Angels. It's
in the book Karmic Traces (New Directions, 2000), and online at
http://jacketmagazine.com/06/wein-form.html.

It's old, but the first chapter of Charles Altieri's
Self and Sensibility in Contemporary American Poetry
characterizes and critiques the conventional lyric,
what he calls the "scenic style."

Hank Lazer's "Criticism and the Crisis in American
Poetry," found in Opposing Poetries vol. I is a very
classroom friendly critique/exploration of the "voice
lyric" and its critics. He quotes extensively from
Altieri's Self and Sensibility.

Another lively piece that might serve your purposes is
Bernstein's "The Academy in Peril: William Carlos
Williams Meets the MLA," the essay in which he
characterizes his now well-known class of "official
verse culture." I believe it's collected in Content's
Dream.

Best,
Joseph

I appreciate the responses I've gotten so far to my question about
critiques of lyric (and would love to hear more).  I'm also curious about
the practical and/or theoretical distinctions folks on
the list make among the terms form, structure and style.  Each term seems
to carry a distinct significance, but also to overlap with the others in
common usage.

Off the top of my head, here are some tentative characterizations:

I would usually tend to think of structure as a macro-level term, evoking
the large-scale "architectonic" aspects of a work.  But I can also imagine
talking about the "structure" of a poetic line (and if works have
"metrical structures," for example, then I guess lines do too).

Style, on the other hand, is often employed as a micro-level term, used to
describe the dynamics of a line or phrase.  I don't really know how
"stylometric" software of the kind that can be used, for example, to
identify a work as probably belonging to Shakespeare functions, but I
imagine it attends at least partly to characteristic word choices and
combinations.  We could probably talk about a writer's style being like
a sort of fingerprint.

Form seems to be the most indeterminate of the three terms, the most
likely to be used in ways that overlap with the others.  In fact, we
could immediately add a fourth term-genre-to the list, since one speaks of
poetic "forms" like the "sonnet" or the "sestina."  But "form" is also
usually taken to be something that all writing has, as in the common
opposition between "closed" and "open" forms.  Good free verse is still
supposed to have it, and when Creeley (or was it Olson?) says "form is
never more than an extension of content" he is pointing us nevertheless to
whatever "form" the poetry assumes even as he directs our attention away
from traditional forms used for their own sake.

How do you use these terms?  Do you find it interesting or productive to
use them at all?  Are they useful only for reading/analytical purposes or
also for writing/compositional purposes?  What sorts of issues or problems
are raised by their use?

Thanks,
Steve

Creeley said it, but Olson edited it when he quoted it, in a letter,
I believe. What Olson did was to erase the second part of Creeley's
original sentence.  Creeley's original full sentence was, " form is
never more than an extension of content, and content never more than
an extension of form."

A radically different statement from the typical hackneyed received
meaning of this phrase as usually quoted.  Do you think that the full
sentence directs attention away as much from traditional forms as the
half-sentence? It has always seemed to me that it doesn't.

  I  look forward to seeing but people say about these questions you
raise --but just want to note that in typical usage, "sonnet" and
"blues poem" and "sestina" and "ghazal" are forms, while "pastoral
poem" and "elegy" and "aubade" and "love poem" are genres.   Genres
and forms may be united by custom but not by definition or necessity.
My understanding is that the ode is an odd odd ode odd exception,
defined by a sort of combination of form and genre.

Annie, Steven and all, these questions regarding form and content are something
I deal w/ at length in my new book _Emancipating Pragmatism_.  As Duncan argued
long ago now, the Black Mountain preoccupation w/ the relationship between them
arises from their interest in William James, Dewey & Kenneth Burke.  Here's a
short excerpt from my book (some of which will be out of context...):

*********************
The following is one of Burke’s more lucid descriptions of language as symbolic
action, in regard to poetry:

The general approach to the poem might be called “pragmatic” in this sense: It
assumes that a poem’s structure is to be described most accurately by thinking
always of the poem’s function.  It assumes that the poem is designed to “do
something” for the poet and his readers, and that we can make the most relevant
observations about its design by considering the poem as the embodiment of this
act…this pragmatic view of the poem…through the emphasis upon the act promptly
integrates considerations of “form” and “content.”


Burke’s “pragmatic view of the poem” has as its antecedent Dewey’s stipulation
that “in the act [of writing] there is no distinction between, but perfect
integration of manner and content, form and substance.” I note this not to
privilege Dewey over Burke via his “originality” but simply as a way of
pointing out that the concept of language as symbolic action which Ellison
found so useful might be located in Dewey’s work as well.  Why is this
important?  The answer has to do with the way the concept of symbolic action
“integrates considerations of ‘form’ and ‘content.’”  As Burke explains in the
quote above, when one speaks of symbolic action there is a presumption that
motives (political, social, psychological, economic) are manifested in design.
What might be considered merely “content” (say, a political point of view)
according to another paradigm has, according to pragmatism, formal
consequences.  Conversely (and this is equally important), *form* (syntax,
grammar, poetics) is considered as *a kind of content*, as socially
substantive, as having, potentially, a social function. Burke, Dewey, and
Ellison are all in agreement on this point.  Again, why then discuss Dewey?
Because Dewey is most useful in illuminating what Ellison means by “the novel
as a function of American democracy” and in explaining why his idea of “the
American vernacular as symbolic action” constitutes a redirection of pragmatist
discourse.
        Dewey describes pragmatist philosophy as a kind of democratic symbolic action
and calls Emerson and James “the philosophers of democracy.”  Most importantly,
he describes what a philosophy which acted as a function of democracy might
look like:

        A philosophy animated, be it consciously or unconsciously, by the strivings of
men to achieve democracy will construe liberty as meaning a universe in which
there is real uncertainty and contingency, a world which is not all in, and
never will be, a world which in some respect is incomplete and in the making,
and in these respects may be made this way or that according as men judge,
prize, love and labor...a genuine field of novelty, of real and unpredictable
increments to existence, a field for experimentation and invention (MW 11:50).

Dewey considers philosophy in the same way that Burke considers the poem: as a
particular kind of *motivated* discourse.  He assumes, that is, that a
philosophical discourse, one of Emerson’s for instance, is designed to do
something, and he considers that discourse “as the embodiment of that act.”
Dewey insists that philosophy is not a form of objective or abstract knowledge
but rather “a form of desire, of effort at action.”  Thus if Emerson writes, as
he does in “Montaigne,” “the philosophy we want is one of fluxions and
mobility” (CW 4:160), Dewey wouldn’t hesitate to relate this to Emerson’s
political desires, his interest in “the strivings of men to achieve democracy”
and his contemporaneous agitation in favor of Emancipation.  He would, in all
likelihood, point out that Emerson here construes philosophy as a *desire* -
not a written transcription of an abstract truth but something we “want.”
Moreover, he would find in Emerson’s style - his “paragraphs incomprehensible”
- similar motivations: a will toward unpredictability in the name of
experimentation and invention.  What this has to do specifically with
sustaining egalitarian politics and democratic institutions I will make more
explicit in Chapter Two.  Emerson theorized that the strivings of people to
achieve democracy in America was predicated on the ability to revise the
definition of America and the definitions at work in its founding documents.
There needed to be, in Emerson’s words, a “belief [among Americans] that as the
people have made a government, they can make another” (JMN11:406).  And this
belief could best be fostered by a corresponding belief that the generation and
maintenance of meaning was an unpredictable and ongoing affair.

Anyhoo, hope this interests,

whoa--that's way better--way way better. doesn't this
go back to the ghazal discussion many many months ago:
when I was trying to express dismay that writers would
try on a form of another culture and literary
tradition like they were trying on pants? PoMo and
Playful perhaps but weirdly ignoring a true engagement
with the form: that the subject will be changed by it;
the way that it was said (by who?--Pierre will scold
me for not knowing this) that the original is changed
by the translation.

i like thinking like this: that Joan Retallack is just
as rightly called "formalist" as Marilyn Nelson or
John Hollander. but that's only considering what you
start with: constraint or language. and that's only if
you happen to believe there's a choice: that language
isn't automatically "constraint".

We were at Yoshi's too because our 18 year-old son is a percussionist and
wanted to see his hero.  What an eerie and sad and finally amazing event, to
seeing someone so ill but still doing what he's done all his life.  Our son was
amazed and moved.  Maxine CHernoff

It's a shame to hear about Elvin, one of the great drummers.

I saw two people play just before they died:

Bill Barron, a good man and underappreciated saxophonist, was dying of
Cancer when he played his last engagement at Hartford's 880 Club. He could
barely blow air through his horn and had to sit when he wasn't soloing.

Thomas Chapin was dying of leukemia when he played at the last minute during
a benefit concert held for him in his home town, Manchester, CT. Tom and I
were very close, like brothers. I told him if he was too weak to play, not
to, to try not to push himself the way Bill Barron did and to stay within
himself if he did decide to play. He came onstage, said his musician
colleagues told him he could probably play about ten minutes of flute. He
proceeded to play "Aeolus," a marvelous ballad at the peak of his skills. He
managed to summon the last bit of strength from his reservoir. The audience
was teary-eyed, shocked by what it had heard. The next day Tom fell into a
coma. He died about two weeks later. But he spent his last conscious moments
doing what he loved most and doing it in a way that ranked with the best in
jazz history.

Textploded


http://www.hevanet.com/solipsis/desktopcollage/Textplodedlg.jpg

The Textploded narrative exists with reference to general semantics
as the non-ordinariness of the shaman exists in relation to those he seeks to cure.
An entire passage, any entirety, may only represent a single character at some superficial 'exothetic' level
but alludes to an 'endothetic' manifold of textploded becomings between the reader and the author,
strings of narrative which are collapsed into the space of the narrative "character," (also, as in qualitative)
hence this text might thusly be rendered as a kind of sloppy H on a horizon performed by a hovering island,
enormous in its scope, of loosely stacked books, its ink an embodied swarm of living, mechanalogue, marks,
millions of roaches forming two anthropoid columns connected by an ambiguous
middle space. This middle space in the manifold of the textploded narrative, and
implies an ethics of understanding, a Wittgensteinian understanding, an ambulant or
vers.tehen ki.net.isch, an omphalos/tic kiss of ontopolybinaristic entwinement, a Pragmatismus of continuance
as 'connecstruction' against the frictional agencies of abstract machines which derive their energies, and hence
their social apparatuses from these momentary relational events. A text, then, would represent a kind of
socium of stratas, a physiograpical interface to the imaginal realm. Structure, Form, Content, are
all interpenetrating and projectional, as the force of any text is as a material symbol in the geosocial
Umwelt of embodied minds which in this species flows back into a para-umwelt of recordings,
the manifold of the text, an instrumental feedback umwelt where mutational resonances are pooled, go dormant,
and are then reactivated by other assemblages...

Catherine, do you know of the work of Besmilr Brigham, of Chocktaw
heritage? I believe she considered herself a Mississippi poet but lived for
many years in Arkansas. She's anthologized in _Visit Teepee Town_. After
C.D. Wright took up the cause of making her work more widely available,
Lost Roads published _Run Through Rock: Selected Short Poems of Besmilr
Brigham_.

Below is one of her poems. I'm afraid the interesting spacing of the words
on the page won't come through in an email.

Does anyone know whether she's still living? I had heard that she had
Altzheimer's and was in a nursing home somewhere in the Southwest.

Upon an interlude between Handel's Royal Fireworks Music and Stravinsky's Fireworks,
words were spoken to a powdered wig and a hatchet..

Beyond the obvious ontologicality of an eye, I
distend my hope to the promise of an immanence
of possibility within the hopeless, or arbitrary fields
we designate (as) among the nations, that within
that great weaving, a JOIE DE VIVRE, or even
a jouissance, may emerge to overtake the idle
passions and the great mistake of ideology. A
jouissance whose membrane would then, at last,
look with great pride and anticipation, to the knowledge
of knowledge, our ancient species has so industriously yoked.

I suppose it depends on your definition of innovative. Some of the
authors mentioned so far deal with nature in a traditional American
Indian way, which may appear as innovated, revamped, due to an
unfamiliarity with the way poems are told at readings and festivals.
From my perspective their innovation rests within the use of the line,
which is often drug out over the page in a Black Mountain style, rather
than other aspects of form, visual poetry or using subject material in a
new abstracted way & therefore I would make a distinction between
innovative and experimental.

If the question is about experimental poets, then here are a few:

Carroll Arnett
Saginaw Grant
Robert Nazarene
David Baratier

Jesse Glass is too if he is out there & saw this, maybe he has some
input.

I have Arnett's selected available for $5 post paid if you are
interested.

Be well

Words are in a setting.

A child asks "Where are words?"

"There are words."

Words are volatile, but there is no connection.

Words appear in complete sentences.

The words' sexes change repeatedly.

The root word is pungent alongside other flowers.

A word is an incomplete sentence.

"Word."

Latin words are the root of most evils.

A telegram arrives and contains words and letters.

The letters of most words begin or end in a vowel or a consonant.

Some words begin in a panic.

Words emit an attitude, if not a personality disorder.

The word "I" is active and healthy; sometimes it is self-obsessed.

A dictionary is a penitentiary of words, each cell contains one or two clauses.

A few words caused a catastrophe and English became this.

The irony is, a letter contains words.

Words like "Branch" and "Bough" sprout wings.

Trees are like words in that they point to other trees.

for the innovative native (north) american recs -- yes, David, I do have
Arnett's book --

I posted the complete list on my blog (http://cadaly.blogspot.com)

I am reviewing Glancy's new book, which I love; three poems from it are
online in the Poetry Project newsletter archive for the curious; I would
argue she is innovative in certain ways & also influenced by innovative
poetry -- her first book had an epigraph from Watten; this one is
"written through" an outside / visionary artist (those like Finster who
incorporate text) idiom -- though she's got an epigraph from Hecht in
this one

many outsider artists claim Native American descent, but how much is
"Cherokee great grandmother" hoo hah? (or in my family, or my husband's,
the "drop of Indian blood" rumored for the distant female relative with
decent cheekbones & dark hair)

All best,
Catherine Daly

Annie-I was writing quickly, and a little sloppily, but I'm familiar
with the distinction you're making between form and genre.  I guess
there's a kind of "half sentence" missing from what I wrote too, wherein I
would have gone on to talk about how "form," when used to designate things like
sonnets or sestinas, starts to bleed into the concept of "genre."  And
when we look closely the distinction doesn't stand up all that well, or at
least that's how it seems to me.  You appeal to "definitions" but these
are actually rather blurry right from the start.  I don't have the book in
front of me right now, but the entries for "form" and "genre" in the
Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (I have the old edition) make
the point pretty well.  If you go back to the Greeks, a genre like
"satire" is also called "iambic" because of the form in which it is
written, & elegy is grouped (i.e., "generically") along with epigram and
epitaph because they share the same meter.  Getting a little more
contemporary, say up to Shakespeare's day, a form like the sonnet starts
to look an awful lot like a genre, and it certainly overlaps significantly
with the "love poem."  These days, when I ask my students, before we have
read any sonnets, what they expect a sonnet to be about, the first thing
they say is love.  For me, the ode makes a good example of the kind of
blurring I'm talking about, but not really such an "odd" one.  And right
now, I'm interested precisely in "custom" or usage, especially the current
usage of people on the list, rather than in giving a dictionary definition
the final word.

As for that other "half sentence" of Creeley's, I like the way it has a
certain chiasmic completeness about it.  Actually, the PEPP prefers the
term antimetabole over chiasmus for this particular usage, but I like
chiasmus for its specific sense of "crossing."  Form and content are
"crossed" terms, and maybe they even sometimes get "cross" with one
another.  Which is why I also understand why Olson emended the statement
for polemical purposes, in a move very much of his/its moment.  I'm not
sure we especially need the polemic now, but I see why he needed it then.
Perhaps oddly, this all makes me think of the peculiar position of the
sestina in the stream of 20thC "innovative" poetry.  When Zukofsky wrote
one, "Mantis," in the thirties, his fellow Objectivists Oppen and Rakosi
were annoyed, because it didn't seem to be what the age demanded, and Zuk
felt defensive enough that he wrote another, longer, poem interpreting the
first, and trying to show why his use of the form was "live" and
contemporary.  Looking back, his take on the sestina seems like a
fore-runner of post-modern "procedural" kinds of writing.  And in an
interview Ashbery talks about the liberating effect a really complicated
form like the sestina can have, comparing it to the sensation you used to
be able to get as a kid from riding your bike down a big hill, when the
pedals would start to turn too fast for your legs to keep up (this is back
when bike pedals used to do that).

Now since it's such a beautiful day out I think I'm going to go out and
play.

Who was it that said  "content is never more than a
confrontation with form” ?

Perhaps this statement too could be extended to
‘content is never more than a confrontation with form,
and form never more than a confrontation with content’
?

Someone else said something like ‘The situational
specificity of form explains why followers, imitators,
and epigones can never hope to extend, replicate, or
capture the meaning of a genre in formation.'

[Actually that's someone mixed up with me, I think]


As to Kazim Ali’s dismay of those who adopt/co-opt/use
forms specific to other cultures and traditions, my
feeling is that such ‘cases’ or poems, etc,  must be
viewed themselves with an appreciation for their
manner, situation, etc -- who is doing what with who's
forms and for what reasons?

Fact is, such a debate inevitably must contend with
the bugbear of ‘authenticity.’

 Does the subaltern speak in an authentic voice or is
it heard in the interstices and folds?

Subject:      Creeley and Olson; form and genre
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hey folks:

In looking at Creeley's commentary about the interrelationship between form and content, I think it's pretty important to point out that he was distinctly not speaking in favor of the conventional European understanding of form as a pre-determined structure into which language could be fit.

For Creeley and Olson, the interrelationship between form and content has to do with the discovery of the problem of form and content again on every line of a poem; projective verse is about finding where the next line needs to go relative to the previous line, in terms of both form and content--it's not about dictating that formal situation in advance. A certain content takes structure a certain way; a certain structure takes content a certain way. Both are choices that the writer needs to make, again, on every line of a poem. The point here is hardly, I think, to tease out the distinction between what is form and what is content; the point is that both operate together in ways that the writer must be open to exploring rather than controlling.

So the idea was crucially to not let form take precedence over content, as Creeley and Olson felt the traditional formalists of the 30s and 40s had done. For those formalists, content was something to be poured into, and also shaped by, a pre-existing form, and that's exactly one of the things that Creeley and Olson disliked about them.

Adding the second part of the quotation, that content is never more than an extension of form, doesn't change the implication of the first part of the quotation at all. Rather, it suggests that the second part of the criticism was directed against the idea that one could transparently portray content without understanding how structure shapes content. It was a criticism of the idea that just because content needs to play a role in shaping form, it hardly follows from that fact that form is a secondary add on. Thus in their context they are also criticizing a certain reductive sense of imagism that suggests the clear image is all that counts, a criticism, I take it, that could continue to be applied to much of the conventional narrative verse of our own moment.

The point then is that form and content are in a constant interrelationship in which neither should be understood as taking precedence or being dictated in advance.

Unless one takes Creeley's comment out of context, I don't think that there's any way that his quote should be interpreted as saying that all formal structures are equally interesting just because they are forms. The comment was without doubt a criticism of the way traditional European forms attempt to coerce the shape of poetic language in a way that denies that form can be exploratory, just as it was a criticism of a certain kind of conventional understanding of so-called free verse, then and now.

Whether one agrees with Creeley about such a point is certainly an open question; but please, to suggest that his comment is somehow offering support to the value of traditional European forms just doesn't seem historically accurate.

RFORMERS. The first event includes presentations by Charlie Altieri and S=
teve Shaviro at the Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, May 5, 2004. Donatio=

nce. The event starts at 7:30pm.

CRITICS AS PERFORMERS -- A SUBTEXT SPECIAL EVENT

Well known critics of contemporaneity / postmodernity take to the stage, =
exploring what it means to be a critic as performer. Casting off their pr=
epared remarks &/or taking them up anew, these critics enter into the spa=
ce of their own abandon. No longer avant or apres la lettre, but extempor=
aneous, expropriating, exfoliating, these critics subsume the excess of t=
heir own presence, do just what they want to do, for an evening of wind s=
heer, free fall, perspicacious pleasures, serious maladies and the like.

Charles Altieri, who spent more than a decade in Seattle at the UW, is cu=
rrently Professor of English at University of California - Berkeley. He i=
s the author of numerous books on critical theory and literary modernism,=
 and a leading authority on expressive theories of art. He has a new book=
 from Cornell University Press titled The Particulars of Rapture: An Aest=
hetics of the Affects. His books include: Painterly Abstraction in Modern=
ist American Poetry (Cambridge); Canons and Consequences (Northwestern); =
Subjective Agency: A Theory of First-Person Expressivity and its Social I=
mplications; Postmodernism Now: Essays on Contemporaneity in the Arts.

Steve Shaviro is author of Connected, or what it means to live in the net=
work society (University of Minnesota, 2003), Doom Patrols (Serpents Tail=
), The Cinematic Body, and Passion and Excess. He is currently teaching h=
is last term at the UW before moving to Detroit to teach at Wayne State U=
niversity.

CRITICS AS PERFORMERS #2 - OCTOBER 24th 2004 at the Henry Gallery.

The second event will feature Marjorie Perloff and the return of Charlie =
Altieri. The second event is co-sponsored by the Henry Art Gallery.

The future Subtext 2004 schedule is:
June 2, 2004: Lidia Yuknavitch (Portland OR) & Stacey Levine
July 7, 2004: Subtext 10th Anniversary Reading
August 4, 2004: Nathaniel Tarn & Janet Rodney (both New Mexico)

Well, that IS pretty well what the remark points out.

Hi!

I wanted to let you know of the U.S. premiere (next week) of my new
experimental-narrative feature, in case you're in town, or if someone
you know might be interested. I worked on it for almost 5 years!  All
info is below and sorry for cross postings.

Hope to see you soon

To write for the utopian break - that window in time
where either day or night must be - there cannot be both -
would be to write for All or Nothing, and that dark night

The narrator passes from his conventional isolation
on a spatial/temporal plane above and beyond the world
captured in the frame (Marker's deliberate illiteracy).

He did not travel protected. He moved from one nation to the next,
from one language system to the next, relying entirely
on the good will of the people in the regions where he filmed.

Whose nervous system was it anyway
the nervous systems of the forces of control extended
extensions over a segregated subjectivity,
the forcing on the other of the maniple obsessively deployed.

Friends and families gathered, as the happy couple met
the press:

“We've got no better partner in understanding the
power of free society.” he said addressing all.

“Canada is an independent nation,” he said. “Canada
makes decisions based upon her own judgment.” he said
at the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Martin at his
side.

He confirmed that Canadian companies will be eligible
to bid on second round reconstruction contracts in
Iraq.

“There are a whole bunch of service contracts coming
out immediately in which we will be entitled to bid.
And so I think that it actually does show that working
together you can arrive at a reasonable solution,”
said the other he. “The Martins did not build up
Canadian Steam Sycophant Holdings on looks alone; Now
should we retire to the boudoir?”

And now, in this BUFFY PO exclusive, we go behind the
primal scene for an in-depth lurk at he and he in:

                “IN NAFTA: NI ATFAN”




"



Prime Minister Paul Martin: Heretofore your silence,
as a behavior, has been a means of power, a species of
sadism, a virtually inviolable position of strength
from which to manipulate and control me who is charged
with the burden of speaking through you.”

President Georges W. Bush: “And you and your
incessant babble is your womanity, your breath, and
your being always expelling itself into the air like a
nauseating banality.”



Prime Minister Paul Martin: “Not everything that can
be thought unclearly can be said unclearly. I suspect
new forms of thinking can only emerge
inter-subjectively. This is a big problem because we
don’t want to lose the potential of modernity and
alienation.”



President Georges W. Bush: "He who has the final
answers can no longer speak for the sake of America
unto the other, as he breaks off genuine communication
in a fit of Texas."


Prime Minister Paul Martin: “What do your silences
mean? What are you hiding, if not yourself?”

President Georges W. Bush: “Can you think of something
more sensible to say or hide?”

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “Well, you're annihilating
yourself only so you aren’t annihilated. Taking matter
into your own head. Into your brain man. But Trudeau
is dead now, my love, dead. Speak, damn you.”

President Georges W. Bush : “I am like Donald Trump
but I don’t know what to say. This is the people’s
trust in me speaking without coerciveness or
education.”

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “I am not some
frog-toothed Frenchmen nor some mealy mouthed Mexicano
by damn. I am here to consummate, with you, the
promise your great nation has heretofore been being
frigid and miserly about.”

President Georges W. Bush: “There’s nothing.”

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “More.”

President Georges W. Bush: “What would you—“

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “Have you say?”

President Georges W. Bush: “If you want me to lead you
can’t expect me to speak because speaking cuts off
thought by its very nature. And if you don’t want me
to lead then you can’t expect me to fuck you anymore
because I only fuck with the crazy wish that I may one
day lead this nation to glory.”

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “I can accept what you’re
saying, but not that you don't love me. And if you
think you’ll ever be able to lead without loving then
you are a moron. Hence, your proposition is bunk.”

President Georges W. Bush: “You manipulative bitch,
you’re saying I have to love you in order to lead
America to its destiny?”

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “Not me, but someone. Like
you, like me, someone like me like you like me.
Someone with shoulder pads.”

President Georges W. Bush: “Listen, the more people
try to articulate everything the smaller everything
becomes. Trying to really articulate, not silence or
pure absence buddy-boy, but what cannot be thought
means moving through what’s been lost in order to
arrive at the unthinkable. I would have thought that
as a Canadian Prime Minister you must have an innate
understanding, or feeling for, the significance of
speaking the unspeakable.”

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “O Georges, baby, I think
I can feel you now. Why won’t you and the founding
fathers annex my ass like a subsidiary? Why won’t you
talk to me the way you used to? Like a father.”

President Georges W. Bush II: “Because in order to
talk that way I had to do so much blow that all that
x, y and z that I read when I was a cadet-cum-scholar
came surging through my spine making it a whip of me,
into me, like a bolt of hot cum.”

Prime Minister Paul Martin: “My lands, I want to be
your total object, complete with missing parts.
[sings] Oh I can't go on, can't go on, can't go on
Everything I have is gone Since my man and I, me and
my daddy ain’t together Keeps raining all of the time
Oh, oh, keeps raining all of the time Oh yeah, yeah,
yeah raining all of the time Stormy stormy Stormy
weather Yeah.”

Georges W. Bush: Listen, seriously, if then ye would
have judgments of things pertaining to this
administration, set them not to judge who are
recognized in literature.

Paul Martin: Who? Nobel Lauretes Billy Collins and
George Bowering? Yourself?

Georges W. Bush: The very same. What is being talked
about is called working to rule, see. When I
experience deja-vu I get panicky looking for a way
out. I have this sense that it’s possible to access
something like a thought, a piece of information, or
even a feeling that’s recent enough that it will
derail the deja-vu and return possibility to the
present.

Paul Martin: When you experience deja-vu you try to
keep it going for as long as possible, you seek to
ride it out, you’d say you feel safe when you
experience deja-vu like an old friend is paying you a
visit, a new visit, the same visit, the eternal
return.

George W. Bush and Paul Martin: When we experience
deja-vu we reach for the constitution of the United
Arab Emigrates.

Paul Martin: The secret porousness of our bodies, the
attendant shedding and regeneration of our surface
layer and organs too, this unworkable scene, this
dirty decadence must be brought to a halt if this
relationship is going to work.

George W. Bush: Just listen to the drivel my own
daughters have been writing in their journal: “My
student loans have ravaged my thought processes. I
hate my race, class, gender, and ethnicity and I want
to die.” This is devilment and desublimated Marxism.


Paul Martin: I strongly recommend massive brain
re-education.  Devote as much time as possible for 3-6
months reading debunked logical positivism. Self-help
gurus, especially the motivational speaker Zig Ziglar
are good for cut-up and collage.… forget Noam Chomsky,
the collected works of DJ Tanner are complete; books
and listening to mix tapes heavily reliant on early x
and the y totally rock out. Now what is this bollocks
about forced labour?

George W. Bush: Parchman was a complex of 15 labor
camps covering a large area in Mississippi, a closed
society of black men who were offered as "contract"
labor to farms, railroads and industries of many
sorts, passed around to do labor for the financial
benefit of both the contractor and the state who sold
them. Something similar (different) is happening to
our young. I mean, the blacks are still stacked up in
prisons like sweet tar babies in a jar, but all kinds
of folks is becoming like incorporated which is
different (similar) to incarcerated. What I’m talking
about is institutions of higher learning. This world
is not big enough for me and virgin wilderness.

Later that evening over dinner and refreshments, Dick
‘the Pandarus Bear’ Cheney offered a beef roast to the
happy couple before breaking off in one of his
trademark cardiac arrests.
