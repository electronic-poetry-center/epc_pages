Subject:      Tom Mandel's Sonnets
Comments: To: cap-l@tc.umn.edu

Tom Mandel's sonnet sequence Prospect of Release is out (Chax Press,
$12.95, direct from the publisher at chax@mtn.org or wherever good
books are sold...meaning SPD in Berkeley, Woodland Pattern in Milwaukee
and through Rod Smith at Bridge in D.C.) and I'm as blown away by this
work as I was when I first saw the manuscript. Mandel has found a
perfect contemporary value for this form in the elegaic. It's
remarkable that one can write 50 elegies to one man, even a
step-father, each of them so intense in feeling and ultimately
different from one another:

To one who dies the world begins again
followed by words to describe it.
Youth and age, luminous with restraint
cleaved rock or two not joined. The dead

unite the clods of dirt that cover them
with instruction, their bones without
bare hands. I will do for him what

my father did for his. Landscape is
imperfect, moonlight to make it so.
In unwitting contribution the scientist

has taken to himself with love this
dead thing, vibrating the conscious use
of his own social maladjustment to
reveal a living act of revision.

There are some tremendous things going on in this poem (just watch how
the "v" is used in the final line for example, how it's played off the
liquids there against its being paired with the long "i" and hard "b"
two lines earlier) as there are in every poem in this book.

Prospect of Release is also, to the best of my knowledge, the first
Chax Press volume in awhile to declare itself "Chax Press    Tucson
1996" although that would be a virtual Tucson I do believe -- Charles
and his family have not made the move back from Minneapolis quite yet.

     Yearbook has a CD, Apostrophe is out on tape, WE has a CD out (I think
     its issue 14) and write to Blank Gun Silencer (now nerve bundle

The Cacophony Chorus is pleased to present a reading by Chicago poet Marc
Smith, inventor of the Poetry Slam, in Minneapolis, Aug 14.

Smith, a guiding force behind the performance poetry movement in the U.S.,
will perform at the Bryant Lake Bowl. Energetic, explosive, and
entertaining, Smith's freewheeling readings mix the power of poetry with
the possibilities of performance into one seamless blend.

Smith will be reading and signing copies of CROWDPLEASER--his first ever
book of poems--in which he recreates the effect of live presentation on the
printed page with the help of vivid line drawings by Michael Acerra.

The Bryant Lake Bowl, located at 810 West Lake Street in South
Minneapolis, features an intimate cabaret theater with full bar and
restaurant service. Tickets are $6.00. Call (612) 825-8949 for
reservations.

The Cacophony Chorus is an ongoing performance series highlighting the
variety and vibrancy of spoken word talent in the Twin Cities of
Minneapolis and St. Paul.

RE: Language Poetry and "world" and "experience"--


from Lucaks on, world means something that points simultaneously to epic
and lyric--not mutually exclusive but epistemologically divergent
genres/modes--Watten's worldliness has much to do with what Thoreau and
Cage would have been like if they had been Marxists or Neomarxists instead
of post-Kantians--

again--with experience--you have a divergent configuration within a
Neomarxist (Althusser) sense of how experience is constructed by
culture--and this does not obviate what Emerson indicated by experience
and how that line points to (for example) Williams and Baraka and Wieners
and Fanny Howe--

perhaps words like world and experience can be experienced by poets as
passageways that lead simultaneously to different experiences of different
language-worlds--

Hey, Maria--

It's me again.  Crowdpleaser is being published by Jeff Helgeson/Collage
Press here in Chicago.  Marc Smith has a  Crowdpleaser web page, which I
believe has all the pertinent info.  But Snail Mail is Collage Press,
P.O. Box 1904, Chicago, IL  60690-1904 and phone is 312-764-0353.
Jeff's a great guy and the book is fab!

Subject:      Re: Spoken Word, LINEbreak, & the list

I am just back from a month mostly off-line (I did check in a few times
earlier in the month) and will soon read through the 1500 or so messages for
what once a slow month on this list.  Thanks again to Joel Kuszai who
watched over the list in my absence and will continue to work with me on the
list.  Questions about the list should be directed to us at
POETICS@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU.   At least for the moment.  The whole VMS
cluster at UB (our VAX system) is being dismantled this year so all those
"@ubvms" addresses will be changing to "@acsu.buffalo.edu".  Our IBM system
is also being dismantled and that means this list will be shifted over to a
UNIX machine, as "transparently" as possible, and that our new list address
will change either to Poetics@acsu or Poetics-L@acsu.  The "L" might be good
as point of clarification but then "poetics" alone remains appealing.  More
on this as we hear about it.

ON SPOKEN WORD, or as I would prefer to call it, poetry readings, as many on
the list will know, in 1994 I edited a CD called LIVE AT THE EAR, with
selections from 13 poets: Susan Howe, Ron Silliman, Leslie Scalapino, Ted
Greenwald, Rosmarie Waldrop, Alan Davies, Barrett Watten, Erica Hunt, Bruce
Andrews, Hannah Weiner, Steve McCaffery, Ann Lauterbach, and myself.
Remarkably, copies are STILL AVAILALE for the original $15.95 if you ACT
NOW.  Order from SPD or direct from the Elemenope Productions: 7 Market
Square, Suite 281 Pittsburgh, PA 15222 or use Elemenope's "800" number:
1-800-240-6980.

I posted some information, including technical details, on LINEbreak as my
last post in late June. But to repeat: These are a series of about 30
half-hour interview shows that I did over last year, produced by Martin
Spinelli; each include about 10 minutes of readings.  All the shows will be
put up at the EPC but we are also making cassettes available and we are also
working on a book version of the shows. The shows are now available through
the Public Radio Satellite Program and will be made available to independent
stations as well: however, radio programmers are not exactly lookin' to add
poetry to their schedules so the potential for this program to be heard over
the radio is sadly diminished.  For further information on LINEbreak, you
can contact Martin at linebrk@acsu.buffalo.edu. OUR URL is

bob, would you mind sharing your conception of what this "movement"
includes, or leaves out?  i've heard it most often in conjunction
w/ the slam scene; & hardly ever applied to sound poetry, fr
example...    "spoken word", and just plain old poetry readings,
seem to intersect but not completely overlap...    "movement"
seems like such a strongly loaded term to me (a marketing term,
to my ear), i wonder how its meant.  seems to be a number of
us here w/ interests in this direction--any other opins?

Huh?  Marc Smith invented the slam?  I thought Al Simmons and Terry
Jacobus invented the slam, with poetry readings in boxing rings, etc, in
Chicago around about 1980?  At least I was hearing about slams and them
back then.

Yes, you are perhaps correct, "Movement" is a _very_ loaded word -- one
person's movement is another person's obstacle. And yes, that post was
pulled from a recent news release we sent out, so some marketing tone
remained when it really wasn't necessary for this list. My apologies.

I used it because Marc has for over a decade been not only a poet and
performer, but a producer and organizer. He's the one who came up with the
poetry slam format at the Green Mill in Chicago many years ago -- yes,
there were previous poetry boxing matches -- but from my understanding, the
distillation that we now call a slam started with Marc.

For a more (in)complete history, check out:

     http://www.tezcat.com/~malachit/slam/

I think all this became part of a movement when folks like Smith, Bob
Holman (hi Bob), and Gary Glazner started the first National Slams in 1980.
Since then it has become an international event with hundreds of
participants and thousands of fans, as well as an uncounted number of local
unaffiliated slams.

Clearly, the merits of the slam format can be debated (I'm of very mixed
opinions myself, and I'm not really interested in going down that road).
Neither would I _ever_ argue that the slam is the reason that poetry has
regained some level recent cultural popularity.

No, the point being is there is now a whole nother access point to poetry,
one available to people outside the academia, and that these folks are
begining to network themselves across the country not merely through slam
networks, but regional publications/zines, schools/institutions, and other
avenues. (Take this list for example.) This is the "movement" I had in
mind, and I hope to think of it as inclusive, rather than exclusive.
Therefore, IMHO, we're all part of it to some degree or another.

(I should note here, I'm one of those heretical "spoken word" people, and
I'm grooving on the cross pollination that is taking place with text-based
works, whether it is poets, storytellers, or performance artists.)

If you're interested, I recently interviewed Boston Slam Master Michael
Brown about many of these same points:

Subject:      Fwd: Borders boycott
Comments: To: wr-eye-tings@sfu.ca

Dear folks:

The picketting in front of Center City Borders continues.  Please join
us on Saturday, August 10 beginning at 12 noon to show solidarity for
fired union activist Miriam Fried.  The picketting is taking place
every Saturday but we'd like to have a strong NWU showing there on the
10th. Border is located on Walnut St., between 17th and 18th Streets.

For those of you unfamiliar with the saga, here's a brief update.
The Center City branch of Borders recently fired one of their
employees, ostensibly for bureaucratic reasons.  But the truth is, she
spearheaded a union drive at the store.  After Borders brought in a big
union-busting firm, the union drive failed this last March.

The United Food and Commercial Workers have taken up the case, filing
an unfair labor practices suit on behalf of Miriam.  They are also
starting to sign up employees for another union drive (another election
can't take place until March 1997).

A number of unions in the city, including AFSCME, UFCW and IWW, are
supporting Miriam and the Borders boycott.

So please come out on the 10th, join the picket line, and show writerly
solidarity for a fired bookseller.

John

your query about "cancer poetry" while browsing the Medicine in Literature
messages pages on the internet.  I am the new editor of the South African
Family Practice Journal, and our October edition will be focusing on
cancer. If the person is interested in my having a look at the poetry to
see if it will "fit" with the other articles, they should feel free to
forward it to me via e-mail.  Unfortunately, we would not be able to pay
anything (and even if we could, the South African currency is so weak at
the moment, it would amount to very little in dollar terms). Also to be
taken into account is that the journal has a rather limited circulation at
present, even though it is 15 years old.  We're working on changing that.
I look forward to hearing from you, Roy Jobson (M.D.) Roy and Marje Jobson

>When is a movmeent just a recognition, a naming what has existed for

the reading that luanched the beats, with kerouac as dorman and designated

performance poetry/slams/spoken word have increased awareness of poetry's
conneciton with body, vernacular, and current media. some poets have always
worked this connection--like blake  mallarme   whitman.
what would be fantastic would be a wave to maintain the neregy level of
'performance/spoken' with syntax-deep, connotation-rich work (which might
not fit the slam's 3 minute limit or appeal to an audience if it was short
enough) that is, i believe, at the core of poetry:  unleashing the power of
language as it can tap collective and specualtive consciousness' in a wide
variety of peoples.

just a note to say that though i don't recall the person's name either (male and
from "down under" is all i recall, and not wystan or tony), i feel a glow of
pleasure at this possibility, and i like it that this list enabled a (potential)
publication of poems know one on the list knows (but cd be important to
someone), in a publication that (probably) no one on the list knows (but cd be
important to someone). md

One useful thing that's happening in the slams here in Dallas is that
we have featured poets, performing before the event and between the
rounds. While these are often visiting Slam poets and the like, they
frequently feature poets who work in different formats. It's a good
spot for people whose work tends to go on beyond the 3 minute limit
or does not have the competitive inyourfaceitude. My sound-poetry
ensemble, "Question Authority, the", are going to be featured a few
weeks from now. While we're definitely not Slam poetry (though some of
our members have slammed), we think what we do will get a good
reception (once people get beyond their initial confusion :-]).

I was wondering if you could do me a favor & post this to that Poem Chat
List that you frequent, & see if anyone could provide me with a bit more
information on this. (As per your suggestion, I've been considering
actually signing ON to that list; but I am not sure that I could get it here in
Italy? & anyway, who wants 100 pieces of email every day? I much
prefer just 'hearing' about it from you).

Well, on to my question. While in Rome recently, I caught wind of a
wonderful piece by Mr. H. Gould that appeared back in the States in
something that has been refed to as A POX OF THEM. Apparently it is a
perfect example of what the Geist has to say. This is a wonderful
question really, What in deed does the Geist say? Can anyone enlighten
me as to what a.) The Geist says? & b.) What Henry has said it says, if
you feel that a. & b. are substantially different?

{An email document of the text might suffice, but I doubt that a hard copy
would ever make it to me--has anyone out there ever tried to GO to the
Post-Office in Italy?}

Many thanks. Yours,

T.Door

     B.) Henry, following Hopkin's ruse, has made you believe in its
     plausibility, therefore: Just don't call it late for dinner. Or to
     re-phrase Pound in a pleasing manner, pilaster and perish!

     It's difference is well documented in music, say the differrance

While in Italy in the Fall of 1977, I saw television coverage of this event
(though I dont know whether this happened often). They showed a
bulldozer-like machine pushing mounds of mail into the flames.

        I was living in Arles, France in May '68.  There was no
Postes-Telegraphes-Telephones. A dog show drew huge crowds and the
Communists attempted to distribute truckloads of free potatoes--which the
Gypsies stole.  There was so much going on no one missed the mail.

        Re disgruntled former postal employees and buried mail, there's
Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, from which this:

        The report was this:  that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk
in the Dead Letter Office in Washington, from which he had been suddenly
removed by a change in the administration.  When I think over this rumor,
hardly can I express the emotions which seize me.  Dead letters!  does it
not sound like dead men?  Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone
to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten
it than that of continually handling these dead letters, and assorting
them for the flames?   . . . On errands of life, these letters speed to
death.
        Ah, Bartleby!  Ah, humanity!

Many years ago when I was a younger poet (and not yet fiction writer), I
wrote a prose poem on the subject of the dead letter office.  Text
follows:
                  Wistfulness covers the windows like drapes.  Ten men,
armed with hankies, sort the mail into two categories, letters that make
them happy, letters that make them sad.  Don't get me wrong.  These civil
servants, trusted with the awesome duty of burning millions of letters a
year, do not open the envelopes like a mortician prying into the life of a
client.  It isthe envelope itself that makes them sad.  Childish
handwriting scrawled to a deceased aunt makes them weep.  A letter from
overseas to a wife who has moved, unknown to her husband, creates such
tumult that the walls  quiver like jelly.  Few letters are happy ones, the
eviction notice never delivered, the lost bill.  But when a happy letter
comes into their possession, it's a red letter day.  The men cheer wildly,
tear up letters and toss them out of the window, tickertape fashion.  ANd
what bliss when something intervenes and a doomed letter, like a
terminally ill patient, is saved.

US fiction re the post office:

=46rom the Eudora manual, Version 1.5:

"When I was looking for a name for my new Post Office Protocol mail
program, I thought immediately of the title of a short story I=B9d read year=

of the story, Eudora Welty.

"'Why I Live at the P.O.' can be found in a collection titled A Curtain of

anything else you can find by Ms. Welty.  Her stories are funny, sad, and

        Re postal workers, memorials, unions--and dreams:

        An interesting book concerning postal workers and the male:

        Charles Olson's The Post Office  A memoir of his Father (Grey Fox
Press, available at SPD and Woodland Pattern) which concerns Olson pere's
efforts on behalf of the mail carriers' union.  These efforts were much
hampered, leading to the senior Olson's loss of joy in life and early
death according to his son, who also worked as a mail carrier during
summers off from school.

        The story of the father linked significantly to the "Pilgrim fathers":

         . . .  the trouble out of which his death came was born fourteen
years earlier . . . .
        I can date it that exactly because it was his determination to
take me to the celebration at Plymouth of the 300th anniversary of the
Pilgrim landing that aggravated the situation his superiors at the Post
Office had provoked.

The Italian Postal System

First all the envelopes are dipped.
For this purpose, giant scald cauldrons
Are used, the very ones that Caesar Augustus
Had ordered brought from Egypt for use as boneboilers
By the Capuchin monks. During the Dip
A strike probably occurs. The vats
Are then generally purged by all passing caribinieri
Whose uzis have been recently lost, but if not,
The steam, which has been clinging to the ever-
Changing ceiling frescoes, is revaporized
And thereafter recondensed several times by means
Of centrifugal coolants, with diffrent centrifugal coolant
Manufacturers employed in the North, Central
And Southern Postal Universes. This process quite often replicates
The original addresses directly upon the appropriate
"Lost While In Transit" cards. Thus ends the Dip.

The donkeys are led out, and attached to the carts,
Each bearing the Postal Code Numbers, or, for International,
A System of Carrots, the sizes and expressive shapes
Of which have all been translated into a Code of the
World's Regions.  Complex to the casual viewer, one
Italian family has been arranging these carrots
For centuries, and the Annual Festival of the Carrots,
Held in Gubbio but celebrated throughout Italy,
Is cause for great festivities throughout
The Postal System, and any letters in the carrot-id'ed
Carts during this period (usually the month of July,
But sometimes extending into August or even September)
Are treated like good friends and are never allowed
To leave.  Many other elements, remnants of previous Postal
Systems, abound, with meanings lost in time but which
Still provide glimmers of the ancient ways, and for many
Are, indeed, a palimpsest of life itself.  That
The whole actually functions, and that one can,
By placing one's tongue directly on the tiny wafer-
Like stamp, actually participate in this oldest
Of rituals, is a miracle open to everyone.

dear list,
        I know its summer for most of you all, but its peak season down
here and i've been asked to think about poetry and speed --not that
which you are on but what you are at. I wondered about developing 20 or
so propositions before putting out this APB but then speed IS of the
essence and why wait? So while I work at those I'd be grateful for any
tips, pointers, theories, multi-volume treatises you can put my way,very
grateful.
        yours in haste,

                        CALL FOR PAPERS AND CONTRIBUTORS


        The Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing
solicits proposals for its fifth annual conference and contributions for
its new scholarly journal, *Book History*.

        SHARP will meet 4-7 July 1997 at the University of Cambridge.  We
welcome proposals for papers dealing with the creation, diffusion, or
reception of script or print in any historical period.  There are no
limitations on topics.  Proposals for either individual papers (20 minutes
in length) or full panels (comprising a chair and three papers) may be
submitted.  We may also sponsor workshops devoted to shorter, more
informal presentations of works in progress.

        Proposals (one page maximum per paper) and inquiries about the
conference itself (including requests for advance booking forms) should be
sent to:

        James Raven
        SHARP Conference Programme Committee
        51 Sherlock Close
        Cambridge CB3 0HP
        United Kingdom

        The absolute deadline for receipt of proposals is 20 November
1996.  Four travel grants of $250 each will be offered to graduate
students who present papers at the conference: to apply, simply indicate
in your cover letter that you wish to be considered for this award.  All
other participants and presenters will be expected to pay their own
expenses, including the registration fee; so please submit proposals only
if you can arrange for your own funding.

        SHARP is also launching a new juried scholarly journal, *Book
History*.  It will be a hardcover annual edited by Ezra Greenspan and
Jonathan Rose, and published by Penn State Press.

        *Book History* is devoted to every aspect of the history of the
book, broadly defined as the history of the creation, dissemination, and
reception of script and print.  It will publish research on the social,
economic, and cultural history of authorship, editing, printing, the book
arts, publishing, the book trade, periodicals, newspapers, ephemera,
copyright, censorship, literary agents, libraries, literary criticism,
canon formation, literacy, literary education, reading habits, and reader
response.  *Book History* will be published in English, but it welcomes
articles dealing with any national literature.  Publication of the first
issue is scheduled for August 1998.

        Articles dealing with any part of the American hemisphere or the
Middle East should be submitted to Prof. Ezra Greenspan, Department of
English, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA,
ezra.greenspan@scarolina.edu.  Articles dealing with other parts of the
world should be submitted to Prof. Jonathan Rose, Department of History,
Drew University, Madison, NJ 07940, USA, jerose@drew.edu.  Send one hard
copy and a WordPerfect diskette for each article.

        To obtain information on joining SHARP and subscribing to SHARP
publications -- or to request a free sample copy of the SHARP newsletter
-- contact the Membership Secretary, Dr. Linda Connors, Drew University
Library, Madison, NJ 07940, USA, lconnors@drew.edu.

Hi, Wystan, do you mean maxims like :  "Get it down real quick, before
you forget it, or before you get waylaid by self-censorship".
That kind of speed?  It would be speedier to phone you, but yr

OK, here's one really obscure/abstruse for y'all: I need help tracking
down a children's song in Polish which is about crows and begins with the
refrain "Caw, caw, caw," although without any Ginsbergian "Lord Lord
Lord" in it. I swear this is for a poem. Please help a fellow Polack who
married Irish.

Dear list,
               this is good. Speed, poets, it not only a matter of rush
rush rush though. Vorticists are fast, projectivists are fast. What
IS the hurry? What about slow? Is slow also a value? I think I would
like someone to put in a good word for slow. Fast poems, slow readings?
Does poetry speed up or slow down relative to the culture? TV and movies
have been getting faster over the years and what does that have to do
with it?  There's some question of the general economy also. What
thoughts do you have on this tonight, good list people? I am at my post.

slowness.  there was a thread related to this about 9 months ago.  Talent
is often a very slow learner.  Slow, stubborn, meticulous.  Einstein,
Cezanne [there are probably better examples].  Stein, Whitman.  The slow
growth process bumps up against the speed-idols of the avant-garde.
The aged turtles often win the race (but it depends on what race you
think you're running). America, of course, they say is becoming a nation
of aged turtles (I don't know abt New Zealand). In a turtle race,
the FAST aged turtle wins.  (speaking of which, Herbert Huncke passed
away this week, age 81).

p.s. see
Frost's amazing wedding sonnet for his daughter, wish I could remember
the lines, about speed - how they will win by standing still, "wing
to wing and oar to oar".

Subject:      Slam Stats

Hey Maria,

I participated in some group performances of Hannah's work at the Church in
the late 70s-early 80s. They cry for multi-voice, eh? and each of us (I think
Bernadette and Sharon Matlin were involved) were different tones/speeds,
mainly using the map of the lines as a score.

But Hannah reads as she writes, like a journal, the Real Thing, just get it
down. She seems em on yr forehead, she writes em down. Also that amazing
journal when she was locked in the doorless room, fasting.

Offhand is the best brilliance. She did well at the Slam because she always
reads so true and affectless, the crowd was stunned into understanding. We
were welcome in her world. In another world there is a monotone, a matter of
factness belying the quickcutting synapse-leaping Stein-sinking poetry.

The Kurdish Iraqi poet Buland al-Haidari died on Tuesday in London where
he had been living in exile since 1982. He was 70. Early on a member of
the avant-garde group "The Lost Time Group," & one of first         f
proponents in Arab poetry during the 40ies. A communist sympathizer &
political activist he was exiled & fled to Lebanon in 1963.

His books include _The Throb of Clay_ (1946), _You came at Dawn_
(1961),_Steps in Exile_ (1965) & ,many more, though only a few have been
translated inti English. His last collection, _Alleyways of Exile" was
published last week in London. Here is the title poem from the 1968
collection _Journey of the Yellow Letters_, translated by John Mikhail
Asfour (in: _When the Words Burn: An Anthology of Modern Arabic Poetry
1945-1987_):

JOURNEY OF THE YELLOW LETTERS

For a thousand years, children of my poor village
we have been the yellowed letters
in the Torah
and the Qu'ran
and the New Testament,
the encrusted blade of the chisel
carving our frightful shadows in your eyes --
shadows you
worshipped in your hearts,
shadows that became a history void of men.
Each letter swells, and sometimes is
a minaret that stands in prayer;
a church, sometimes, in the dreary mountains;
sometimes black nooses
and ropes.
In sad villages your streets know them,
your sins know them.
For a thousand years
we have been the yellowed letters in the New Testament
and the Totah
and the Qur'an,
the letters of mould
daily manifested
in every shameful pregnancy,
in idols,
in the aoppressor's whip
in God, in Satan
but not once in a human being.

For a thousand years, children of my poor village
we have slept the long sleep of history
and worshipped our frightful shadows in your eyes

                                (September 1968)

Subject:      Speed and Hannah Weiner

Hannah Weiner is one of the truly great performers of the time.  The best
record of this is the New Wilderness Audiographics tape of Hannah reading
with Sharon Matlin and Peggy DeKoursey: Hannah reads the roman type (diary
voice), and Peggy reads the italics (mostly comments) and Sharon reads the
CAPS (give instructions); both italics and Caps are "words seen"for me it's
the best realization of polyvocality I know of.  James Sherry and I once
performed with Hannah and it was interesting to see how exacting her
directions for our reading were.  She had a very specific pace in mind and
also wanted a precise adherence to the text.  This is partly because she had
an auditory vision of exactly what the text sounded like.  (I have a copy of
this performance and someday may be able to put it up on the web as a
soundfile!)  Hannah is also featured on the Live at the Ear CD and you can
get some sense of her speed reading from that.
        Hannah always said to me she couldn't stand slow readers at poetry
readings and that applied to virtually all readings by fiction writers.  In
her earlier work she would fill the page up without any space or margin
partly to transmit the electric sense of speed that pulses through the
writing.  White space was a vacuum that she abhorred or sucked up.

I have a bibliography of Weiner books, mss and reviews that I did in 1990
and have today updated;  I will try to bring to put it up on the EPC as soon
as I can.  I will also send a version out to Poetics now.  There are a
couple of queries in that and no doubt some errors; any help appreciated.



***
As I think I probably mention on the list before, I wrote "Introjective
Verse" (now out in the new CHAIN) in response to the editors (Pierre Alferi
and Olivier Cadiot) of a French magazine "Revue Generale de Litterature"
wanting a piece on Olson's "Projective Verse" for an issue they were doing
on "speed".  I wanted to do something on slowing down, along the line Wystan
suggests in his post.

RE: poetics discussion

It would interest me to start a low-key discussion concerning a
range of postmodern poetics evoked by but not limited to the work of such
poets as John Yau, Fanny Howe, David Shapiro, Susan Howe--with reference
also to Amiri Baraka, Robert Creeley, Adrienne Rich--

I'm just wondering if there's a forum for
articulating and sharing concerns with lyric practice that cut across so
called party lines and (obviously) share a variety of kinds of concern
with poetic experimentation and politcal and cultural opposition--and--if
such a phrase doesn't seem so neutral--aesthetic and political thought--

so--

All Best,
Joseph Lease-

Subject:      New Books from Meow Press

Hi everybody, before we begin our (pause) "infomerical" (laughter from
audience) I'd like to take this moment to think back to Orono, you know,
Orono. I want to thank Orono for Melvin Tolson, whom I've found in the
Buffalo Public Library. Funny to think that you can't check out a book of
poetry in buffalo, most poetry existing behind closed stacks. The same is
true for music library too--and the ERie/County-Buffalo public main branch
has a great music section, a mix of 20th sentry music (probably lingering
from the good ol' days at the philharmonic (John Tesh coming this year,
Doc Severinson's holidy opus+)and an interesting selection of music from
around the world--both traditional and contemporary. They let you check
out 10 cds for a week and I'm gettin a real education in music this way.
Anyway, it is okay to have books stored away for safety, for some
future researcher, I suppose. Like music, you have to make the
books you need to read.

On that note, some books are finally available from Meow Press, which is
3years old this month. More books on the way include: Aaron Shurin, CODEX
(with in-laid color reproductions), Stephen Ratcliffe, SENTENCE, Noemie
Maxwell, THRUM, Charles Alexander, FOUR NINETY EIGHT TO SEVEN, Jorge
Guitart, FILM BLANC, Denise Newman, OF LATER THINGS YET TO COME, Deanna
Ferguson, ROUGH BUSH, David Carl, THE LIBRARY, and more (I don't have the
list with me).

Catalogs are available by mail: send queries backchannel to me.

no.

but: you might look in the index of John Shoptaw's book about Ashbery--I
recall that there are some remarks about Ashbery's Craven poem in DDOS--and
I think a footnote or two that might be of some use.

btw what do others make of the Shoptaw book?

Subject:      Re: Speed

Perhaps one should have david eggleton & melville (clarel) reading at the
same time. they are fairly silly examples. on the page, i am in favour of
slow, i like words to come out about the speed that i think. Talking is
pretty fast at the moment & poetry provides a greatly needed contrast. I've
been rereading long poems recently (for a project): the maximus papers,
patterson, homer they have a certain ponderousness which is part of their
reading pleasure. Aloud speed can have advantages but (if you'll excuse a
sport analogy) is more like boxing than sailing. Comes down to the mood i
guess. Sunday nights a slow poetry night.

Sleeping soon,

Dan

Subject:      My Home Pages

A while ago Mark Wallace mentioned my essay "Frame Lock".  With the
permission of Jerry McGuire, editor of College Literature, which published
the essay in 1994, I have now put it up on the EPC:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bernstein

In June I also put up some "HTML" poems I have been working on, and you can
find these at my home page as well, with links to Kenny Goldsmith terrific
ongoing anthology of visual poetry.  My idea for these works was to create
viusal texts that came out working within my word processing program, so
that the "visuality" was less pictoral and more a byproduct of the means
availalbe in this medium to visually represent language (and in this way
related to my other visual texts, such as "Veil" and "Language of Boquets"
that Kenny has samples on his site).  I have also put up the syllabus for my
Fall graduate seminar on the Poetics of Translation.

Regarding Arthur Cravan, I haven't gotten that far in the book yet, but
it seems that Carolyn Burke's bio of Mina Loy has a fair amount of info
about the boxer-poet Cravan, who was her second husband.

Also, for some reason I have always thought (don't know from whence this
information is derived) that Cravan was supposed to be the model for the
hero of Gide's Caves du Vatican (Lafcadio's Adventures).

Good language is always good at getting us to expand our sense of the
present, our presence. The media seems to be inhumanely good at
eliminating the present, and (once again) our presence.  A virtue I have
found in paying attention to language is that it puts me in a comfortable
relationship to time . . . enables evaluativeness. Not (an)esthetic, but
an esthetic sedation that helps the 'bash' of the high-threshold lows
created by the "blunting of the senses" that need hourly gratification as
Wordsworth says.  The world is too much with us, indeed.

I just heard some great lyrics today by a pretty good poet and not half
bad drummer on this subject . . . how humans, today, live in dog years:

"I'd rather be a tortoise from Galapagos
or a span of geological time . . ."

Subject:      lost in the supermarket

     Tristan,

     There is no present. A present is so close it seems obtainable but
     when it comes down to the gritty, just far enough of a length to have
     some downtime between interstices. Hence the reliance on endings, as
     if the history of circadian rhythms were a false premise because some
     whiteguy made a newfangled discovery. Throw it all away. Talk about
     speed, in the suburbs where to renounce speed through the act of
     walking (one which I might add furthers the connection with the
     present) is to conflict with the classist version of interior space,
     one where the landscape is not to be littered with such apparitions of
     outsiders, the marginalized, the crazy, the children walking to the
     supermarket. In similitude, the affliction of the lyric is sold to us
     as a renunciation of speed, that scenes of an uncertain action of
     disjunction should be upheld to create a violence on the eye of a
     potential reader whose distance is a recess. The multimedia
     elimination of the present (& prescence) is no different in vacuity
     than the false asssumption that we can fully appropriate an experience
     of the other, just because of the great textual I am. In terms of a
     post-modern syndoche,  the ghost of a part confronts us, while the
     compared whole, or solid core, has dissappeared.

     CB: Weiner has a healthy section of work in the new 6ix, including an
     essay by Marc DuCharme.
     Be well.

Subject:      go fast or go slow

It seems to me that there's not any inherent value per se in a poetry
that goes fast or a poetry that goes slow--statements like "I like it
fast" or "I like it slow" may tell us something about the taste of the
authors in question regarding the aesthetics of poetry or whatever else,
but in fact they tell us little more than that. The issue seems to me
rather how a certain "fast" or "slow" dynamic in various social contexts
pertains to those contexts and not simply to the dynamic of the writer
him or her self. Marinetti's interest in speed has to do with his
ideology of the machine; differently, the laconic nature of, say, Robert
Frost, has something to do with his rejection of modernist investments in
the machine, in favor of (equally problematic to me) a staunch
restatement of the condition and value of certain traditional moral
stances in the face of change--neither of these are meant as total
descriptions of their authors.
        I'm tempted to make a case for Hannah Weiner's speed, and her
 assault on white
space as pertaining to the way her work seems to argue that "blank space
is already written on," that is, far from representing some existential
silence, white space in her work is that place where ideology is in
charge of us; her ability to write against that white space seems almost
like a "talking back to" or "talking through and with" a set of voices
that might otherwise overwhelm her by forcing her to be silent. But that's
just what I'm thinking today.

     Permutations of the Gallery is an ambitious collection, even if
     recklessly so. Joshua McKinney's poems struggle against the confines
     of syntax and literal sense, in order to arrive at a uniquely clear
     grasp of the truces we must maintain with time and spacial existence.
     To attempt to paraphrase these knotty and paradoxical poems would be
     akin to stating that Wallace Stevens wrote about the weather. Don't
     search for narrative threads here, poems about Queen Anne's Lace or
     cicadas, or paeans for our humdrum, domestic lives. And don't expect
     to read this book once.
                                                        Naton Leslie

     Joshua McKinney knows that philosophy is not an abstract matter, nor
     in anyway separate from our everyday lives. His poems show that to
     engage the world intimately, we need to _think_ it in the most
     particular ways. In *Permutations of the Gallery* family friends,
     nature, and a troubling social world are not givens, but rather
     questions by which we explore the twisting, disruptive, estatic,
     sometimes even annihilating terms of our existence.

                                                        Mark Wallace

     A poetry held taut, that revels in economy and clarity, is filled with
     insights and syntactical compassion. I highly recommend *Permutations
     of the Gallery*.

I really like the point here--the Frost/Weiner contrast works
brilliantly--and the matrix shifts as well when one thinks of, for
example, Blake's anti-industrialism and the different kinds of poetics
that his work suggests--

question--though--

where would Pound's anti-industrialism fit in here--

Something of possible interest to the lis -- Pierre

G7 NATIONS PROPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS

HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH WARY OF OUTCOME OF TERRORISM CONFERENCE

At a meeting to discuss terrorism on 30 July in Paris, France the
G7 group of nations "endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet," reports Human Rights Watch (HRW). HRW
is part of two coalitions deploring "threats by the G7 to
restrict free speech and privacy rights." According to one
coalition, composed mainly of international divisions of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and HRW, "The G7 (United States of
America, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan)
called for "the prohibition or censorship of sources that may
contain `dangerous' information, restrictions on the electronic
speech of unpopular political organisations, and the imposition
of `key escrow' or other means of allowing governments to violate
privately encrypted correspondence."

The latest action, which HRW and its partners call
"anti-terrorist hysteria," springs from recent events in the US
such as the Olympic bombing and the Trans World Airlines (TWA)
crash. It is "another case in a long list of attempts to restrict
freedom of speech in electronic networks, of which there are
alarming examples in many countries including Australia, Belgium,
China, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and
Vietnam, under a variety of pretexts ranging from `pornography'
to incorrect political opinion to `terrorism.'"

HRW and the others point out that "`offensive' material being
targeted is no different from similar material available in
libraries and bookshops. As well, information on how to make
bombs, as well as other things that would be `banned,' is widely
available, often from the very governments pushing for
censorship." HRW et al opine that "banning such publications from
the Internet will not make it any less widely available. However,
it could become the tool for the censorship of any debate or
opinion which happens to displease the authorities, or `pressure
groups' that do not share those opinions."

HRW also belongs to the Global Internet Liberty Campaign (GILC),
which has pledged to fight these and other recommendations to
censor the Internet. HRW program director Cynthia Brown said,
"Free speech on the Internet is already under attack from states
like Saudi Arabia, China and Singapore, and with this agreement,
the G7 countries are only reinforcing that negative trend." The
GILC was formed at the annual meeting of the Internet Society in
Montreal. In addition to HRW, members of the coalition include
the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, the Internet Society, Privacy International,
and the Association des Utilisateurs d'Internet.

Further details on the G7 meeting are contained in a GILC press
release available on the Web at:

it's called

In an article about "Zork" a couple of years ago in the Times Book

article right now but don't remember him particularly backing the statement

Thanks very much for your excellent book _From the Other Side of
the Century: A New American Poetry 1960-1990_ (Sun & Moon Press, 1994).

A friend of mine, who recommended this book to me, said his letter
to Sun & Moon Press (at 6026 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California 90036) was sent back to him with the message "unknown address."
He said he used to be able to reach you with this address.

Could you tell me if this address is still valid?

P.S. I'm collecting Internet resources on
20th-century poets writing in English (with biographical data) at
http://www.lit.kobe-u.ac.jp/~hishika/20c_poet.htm
Your book mentioned above has been a tremendous help for
my page, thanks.

Hi Dodie, it's just a gang of us on a cc list, most are on Poetics as well.
Larry Price's idea. Some call it sub-poetics. I call it the A-list.

listfolks,

i'm interested in putting together a panel for the twentieth-century
literature conference to be held in louisville ky in february 1997.

my work on william carlos williams' early writing (roughly from tempers
through his collected 1921-1931) has got me looking currently at
imagism, objectiv-"ism," pound, zukofsky, periodicals and anthologies
from the teens into the thirties (and all the folks that went into
publishing those as well: kreymbourg, bodenheim, mcalmon), "minor" poets
of the period, etc.

submissions are not due until october, which give us plenty of time to
kick this around.  i'd welcome ideas for papers on any related and
sundry topics.  feel free to reply directly to the list or backchannel.

Thanks to all for the clarifications. And to George Bowering (I think): the
indigo Girls are a pop rock-folk duo from Georgia who write and sing
sentimental lyrics and rhythms that haunt me.

Dodie!
Of all the juicy rumors I gave you you chose the one specifically about
email to out?
Or maybe I delivered the juicier rumors to Kevin?
Or Rodrigo?
There is a subpoetics.
You can have your own subpoetics.
Feel free to add me in, I love to blab..
I go away for two weeks and the Kiev gets someone else to bake the challah.
Basically we wanted to talk about things on a smaller and a larger scale.
Anybody else stunned to see Hank Lazer's two new books and Bruce Andrews'
new book from who is it, Southwest Illinois Modernism Studies? Way cool.
Gettin to them right after I get to Samuel Delaney, who's had too many
hits on my 'who should I read page' to continue to ignore.
For instance, Dodie, you could talk about what I characterized as New
York's 'Bruce problem'.
That would be a real potato caliente, a jesus prepuce to end all whatevers.
Anybody (everybody?) read RH Blyth's Zen in English Literature?
O so mary burger does this great magazine called 'proliferation' and
there are a bunch of amazing autobio poems by Alice Notley in it.
That's one thing I learned in California.
How to start a subpoetics. Ask some people if they wouldn't mind being in
a subpoetics. Then send an email message ccing all the people who said no
they wouldn't mind. Next year this time I hope to have a server with
L-Soft running. Maybe then we can have a thousand poetics.
That was the idea behind poetics, no? To promote the individual indeces
of the real, in as decent a way as possible? Or was it to have a
listserv? either way cool.
Scared to see what's happened to the kasha varnishkas.
Also I learned photoshop.
Was the speed question an oblique tie in to the olympics? A little
marinetti action? Is kemp going to win?
Ach so many questions.
Oh right! Finally got to the famous 530 Page #2 which was even better
than they said. Missed the cordial Katie Lederer but caught the gracious
Anselm Berrigan--a cool lively presence, a Shakespeare play in himself.
Props to Kevin for his amazing intros and outros at New College. Kevin
Killian, of course. Got Stephen Ratcliffe's 'present tense' and wished I
had money for Carla harryman's city lights book.
Went to the antenym #what? steve? reading at Canessa Park, Steve Carll in
pink tuxedo shirt, shaky handed Eddie Berrigan read, read well, Elizabeth
Robinson read some great baby poems, Chris Daniels read a knockout Pessoa
translation.
The virtuality all connects to something! Yipes! Wow. So does that mean
there are as many imaginings caused by a reading of a work of poetry as
there are readers, the poet is the superintendent or the reader?
Did anybody offer poetics bill Luoma's Lisa Jarnot's Marcella Durand's Kevin
Davies's or my books?
I could make that offer. I could offer Steve Carll's and Ange Mlinko's
books too, but that may take an extra week to sort out.

End of performative east coast occasion.

Atlas Press '4 Dada Suicides' has useful discursions around Craven.

Wilde manuscripts.

The book presents selections from Craven's writings also. Worth checking.

Subject: speed & poetry


        The world as we see it is passing--Paul of Tarsus

        Re speed and poetry--one way to think of it is as speed in
poetry--as Susan Howe writes in an essay on Olson, "seeing in a poem".
        Speed in poetry has to do with perception and scale.
        For example, Emily Dickinson:

        To close the eyes is travel.

        I have but to cross the floor to stand in the Spice Islands.

        I do not go away, but the Grounds are ample--almost travel--to me.

        Emerson writes that "language is vehicular".  In "Nature", he
cites the use of mechanical means to attain a "low level of the
sublime"in order to over come "the blank or ruin" that is in the eye.
Through a change in view, the habitual is revealed as "original".

        Pound, Wiiliams and Olson urge writing that is efficient,
fast--Pound thought of X-Rays in relation to poetry (at one point his
nickname was X-Ray Pound), Williams the car and Olson the typewriter.
This speed is related to perception--"one perception following another"
faster and faster as Olson says.  High speed perception slows things
down  (as in a camera)--hence the slowness of reading required by the
notation used by Pound, Olson and Williams, their making long works of
fragments, their use of juxtapositons, "fast cutting" so to speak, among
masses of disparate materials, typographies, spaces.  High speed also
makes for the slowing, stopping of perception, so that the movement of a
rock through geological time may be presented.It also makes possible the
focusing on particulars, which, seen close up, slowed, change not in
appearance but in scale.
        An example of this is the poetry of Larry Eigner.  Eigner writes
often of his concern with "immediacy and force".  The speed of perception
opens space, opens a moment in time, "another time in fragments".
        Speed in poetry is concerned with immediacy. (hence the
documentary aspect in Pound, WCW, Olson, Eigner, Emily Dickinson, Howe).
        Immediacy is not transparency--hence the opacity, the "look" on
the page of these writers.  One does not see "through" the words to the
immediate.  The immediate is made present by the act of reading, which is
slowed, and focuses, makes one aware of, the attention.

        The opposite kind of speed is that of speed reading--which erases
particulars while asserting that it trains one to be able to absrob large
amounts of data.  The smooth surface of speed reading removes the
physical immediacy of opaque writing--"smooths out the bumps", "irons out
the rough spots".

        A paradox may be that writing concerned with the presentation of
immediacy is eidetic--simply by being an object that is opaque rather
than "transparent".

        Which paradox finds its most extreme manifestation in Kerouac,
the fast typer and passenger in Neal Cassady's fast cars.  Kerouac wants
to write spontaneous bop prosody, does sketching in front of objects and
scenes--yet is called "memory Babe", is obsessed by memory.

        Speed in poetry in relation to perception and opacity may also be
thought of as a resistance.  That is, if the opaque poem as object
engages the attention, makes one aware of attention--it directs one to
the question of the art object in relation to perception:  to whom does
it "belong".  (Both perception and object).

        Robert Smithson wrote:  A great artist can make art by simply
casting a glance.  A set of glances could be as solid as any thing or
place, but the society continues to cheat the artist out of his "art of
looking", by only valuing "art objects".

        Speed in poetry directs the attention to an "art of looking",
"seeing in a poem" that opens time, space in relation to scale--and opens
the question of who and what and how are time and space and objects being
turned from perceptions into territories, objects, histories that are
owned, bought and sold.

        (an examination of some of these questions may be found in Karl
Young's review of Olson's
Maximus to Gloucester, at the EPC Olson page.)

And in all that mess
the graciousness
of friends was necessary
sometimes going uncredited--

For instance Dodie Bellamy
lately outing subpoetics
of the 'Bruce problem'
discussions and the 'coigns'

Dodie thank you for setting
up the reading Mary Burger
the mysterious Robert Hale
and I gave at New College

It's a great room, good crowd
A mural painting friend of mine
arrived alerted by your
publicity, I was amazed

Maria for $100 I'll let you
have the subpoetics archives
on a zip drive Mr Filch
I am not java compatible

but you know how email is
so asychronous, a thread
will go along then someone
will come back to town

and answer thirty messages
it's not exactly abc!
Dodie I was amazed and grateful
for instance, the word 'beautiful'

is the topic right now
Lisa Jarnot refers to it
as the 'Special Ed Poetics List'
which I like better than a-list, Rod

it gets how we've totally missed
the point all along
because this is a publication
and that is a backroom

and both have their morning glories
and smoky zones the semi-privacy
affords some well not candor
but reaction Dodie if I pause

it's because my parents
come from different class backgrounds
Steve what do you make now of that
consistently coincidental laughter

and of anybody's failure to say hey
POETICS how are you, to say hello
four hundred people, there's a comfort
level like a middle distance race

not one to one and not Mussolini
at the balcony either tho sometimes
I get the feeling anyway
consciousness at 40 hertz

and A at 440
awake it's noon here and back
to work

--a couple of days ago I posted a message asking if anyone would be
interested in discussing a range of poets--a certain range but I tried to
word my message so as to leave the range open--ie, let the poets define
certain topics of discussion (sites of poetics)--and go for them--adding
poets whenever to the convesation whenever one wanted to--

--the response--and a very reasonable question--was--well, what makes
these poets a group--

--but of course I didn't say they were a group

--nor did I want them to be a group

--however, of course groups are necessary and real and useful and
generative--and of course people understand that there are differences
within groups as well as differences between groups--

--but a question I would like to read pursued is:--what are the ways that
poets can read poets from different and differently defined groups
together (or, as Whitman might put it, side by side)--

--for example (and I really only mean this as an example)--

--one pairing that seems fruitful to me is Amiri Baraka / Bruce Andrews

While that last missive from me wasn't as embarrassing as some of the
misdirected e-mail that accidentally goes out to the whole list, I didn't
need to bore all you folks with my request to Jordan.

So now I can bore with this too.  Sorry.

Maggie has been hanging in Berlin on a Fullbright fellowship & has seen
her work in Mirage & the Impercipient. She holds an AB from Brown.

Sam is an MFA holder from Brown and has a great reading style.

I thought Dave Chirot's post on speed was a good recent example of how
to think along these lines.  Trying to open up an overview
of different strains of 20th cent poetry - sense of historical development
and the general purpose behind certain techniques - how to
move toward a kind of simultaneous perspective
on the different traditions, their strengths & weaknesses...
Weakness, for example in the Pound/Wms/Olson quick-cut collage speed
perception poetry Chirot describes, might be that there are problems
with too-easy breakup of syntax & argument - problems of coherence
("it all coheres, all right, though my notes don't"), problems
of dramatic impact, problems of meaning (stevens, for example, faulted
both the over-scholarly "notation" style of Eliot & Pound as well as
the overly-impressionistic style of Williams - but his own version of
pseudo-statement & pseudo-argument (as in Ashbery) has its own
weaknesses.
  Who can fault these artists, I'm not saying anything was right
or wrong, but it might help to move toward new style-simultaneity
to keep in mind the kind of awareness on the level of aesthetic effect
that Chirot's post showed.  The same approach could be taken using
dramatic narrative speech & stanza effects.  And then you see how they bend
these various techniques toward artistic-political-"philosophical"
poem making (i.e. as you say Baraka & Andrews, for one example).
Chirot's paradoxical remarks on how speed of perception - sometimes
mechanically induced - produced "slowness" of aesthetic effect
& relate to immediacy & documentation - were very apropos.
How does this relate to the performance-overdrive poetry of
today (thinking of the Hannah Wieners posts)? - Henry Gould

Whether John Taggart's 'How to Construct a Clock' is still in print?

Shouldn't this discussion of speed and slowness (an interesting asymmetry
there) be also keyed to the paces of the other body zones, not just the
the mind and the sense organs?  Most obviously, the paces of other activities
such as walking, breathing, sex.

A very clever inversion of initials?

Political layer with language orientation or

Zack (R. Zamora) Linmark's "They Like You Because You Eat Dog" is all of
the below, and more, crazed cyborgian linkages of becoming muliple selves
from Manila to Honolulu to SF gay scene, plus the language is equal too
indeed exceeds all such fixities of what "growing up" or down or out
might me in US polity of Nick at Night acculturations. See "Rolling the
R's" (Kaya Press Productions, out this year) and/or work in Haggedorn's
anthology "Charley Chan Is Dead" etc and Walter Lew on the whole schmeer
of space and selfhoods (Premonitions); Zack has even wilder work on
cross-gender reinventions and recursive Catholicism (not as dessicated or
displaced as Jack Spicer machinics) in Hawaii Review 44 (Fall, 1995),
edited Sean Mac Beth, which has some demonic poems by Morgan Blair (ex
Faye Kicknosway socalled) for goodly measure of excess too. Hope this
helps a bit re below. Rob Wilson

        Anybody

Not to confuse the ether-ial with the real, but I was in Buffalo
last weekend and was struck by the number of ass-kicking chapbooks
from "Leave Press," which published several of the people on this
list.  Does anyone know who publishes "Leave" Books?

 Shouts out to JKuzai for hot chaps tambien.

 A general question placed to the field: Is the future of
poetry in the U.S. the 500 copy laserprinted chapbook?  Is this
the nascent node of the cultural production formerly known as "Poetics?"
I do not come bearing critique, here, just typing aloud, as it were.

 and thanks to those of us (ooh, bad english--, well,
how else would a collective mind talk to itself?) who caught hold
of the Ronald Johnson broadside firestorm.  (nudge)

South African Child Facing Legal Lynching, Civil Rights Activists Protest


        "Under Apartheid, under the state of emergency, Black children were tried as
adults," observed Elaine Salo, a South African doctoral candidate studying in
Atlanta.  "This case is very reminiscent of that situation.  He may not be
accused of a political crime, but they are not taking his age into
consideration.  This is really a child we are talking about."
        After surviving some of Apartheid's most turbulent years, Azikiwe Kambule a
10th grade South African child  is facing the death penalty in Mississippi
for a crime in which many say he was little more than a bystander.
        Despite having no criminal record, no history of violence, providing his
full cooperation to the authorities, and not being present when the killing
took place Azi has been charged as an accomplice to capital murder.
 Mississippi is seeking the death penalty against Azi-- a child who isn't
even old enough to buy a beer, let alone sit on a jury.
        Two local prosecutors, Hinds County District Attorney Ed Peters and Madison
County D.A. James Kitchens, have already acted to seal Azi's fate.
        In April, Peters was quoted in the Clarion-Ledger, a local daily newspaper,
as saying that because the "jurors in [predominantly black] Hinds County have
a reputation for refusing to vote for the death penalty," he and Kitchens
moved Azi's trial to Madison County where the outcome would be more certain,
if not predictable.
        The setting for John Grisham's A Time To Kill, Madison's racial environment
is notorious.  "That jury's gonna lynch 'em," says Charles Tisdale, publisher
of The Jackson Advocate.  "It's just that simple."
        With one of the largest white populations in Mississippi, Madison has become
a virtual haven for the state's less tolerant elites.
         "That county is home to this country's richest and poorest people," says
Tisdale.  "The white folks ran there to avoid desegregation, and the black
folks who've stayed have never received the benefit of their own civil
rights."
        Like his fictitious counterpart in Grisham's's novel, county officials say,
the current Madison County D.A. is hoping this high profile death penalty
case will advance his career.
        "Word is he's planning on running for Judge soon," said a county attorney
who asked his name not be printed.
        Azi's friends and supporters say they are concerned that the part-time
public defender who's defending him won't be up to the challenge.
        "Those attorneys are contracted-- they aren't paid anything extra to handle
capital trials," says Sheila O'Flaherty who was with the Mississippi Capital
Defense Resource Center until congressional Republicans eliminated its
funding earlier this year.  The office had been charged with making sure that
cases like Azi's didn't fall through the cracks.
        According to Steve Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty, court-appointed attorneys in southern states often
receive the equivalent of 4 or 5 dollars per hour to handle death penalty
trials.
        "Look at the facts," says Reverend Robert Abrams, a United Methodist pastor
from Gulfport, Mississippi, "and you will see this boy is more of a victim
than anything else."
        Azikiwe Kambule came to the United States two years ago with his mother
who had received a fellowship to finish her college education in America.
        "He was very excited," remembers his mother, Busisiwe Chabeli.  "He had
always heard us talk about America and he wanted the chance to see for
himself."
        As a student at Chastain Middle School in Jackson, Azi had no trouble
adjusting academically; he received excellent grades, was placed in honors
classes and joined the school choir.  Yet, Azi found himself under immense
social pressure -- he didn't look, speak or dress like other children in his
neighborhood.
        Azi wanted to "fit in" with his peers, and not be the subject of their
ridicule.  He met and started spending time with youth who were older and
very street-wise.
        While attending Jackson's Murrah High School, Azi's grades began to fall;
his  parents worried that his new friends were the wrong crowd.  Fearing the
worst, they decided to scrape together the funds to send Azi to a boarding
school.  Tragically, it was already too late.
        Last January, a week before he was to leave for the Piney Woods School,  Azi
found himself in the middle of a car-jacking in which a young African
American woman was kidnapped and ultimately killed.
        According to police testimony during a pre-trial hearing, Azi himself was so
far away from  the crime scene that he did not hear the gunshots.  When
arrested, he was the only one to cooperate with the police.  He fully
explained the terrible series of events that ended with the death of Pamela
McGill-- a young African American woman who was popular in the local
community.  After his arrest, Azi tried repeatedly to help the authorities in
their investigation.
        Civil rights activists say they fear that outrage about McGill's murder has
inhibited many people's ability to see the injustice being perpetrated by
local prosecutors.
        "While the tragedy of Ms. McGill's death is an emotional fire burning out of
control in our community, we must look at the larger political dynamic of the
prosecutors' decision to move this trial to Madison County to ensure these
two young people get the death penalty," commented L.C. Dorsey, assistant
professor of social work at Jackson State University and former executive
director of the Mississippi Prison Defense Committee.
        "It seems that their guilt has been decided even before the trial has
begun."
Scheduled to commence August 19, Azi's case is already beginning to attract
national and international attention.
        "The situation in which Azi finds himself speaks volumes about the use of
the death penalty against children," Hawkins says.
        "During this decade, only five nations in the world are known to have
executed persons for crimes they committed before their eighteenth birthday.
 Those countries  are Iran, Pakistan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia . . . and the
United States.  And America has executed more than the other four combined."
          According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, a
condemned child in the United States also tends to be of darker hue -- 66% of
those persons sentenced to death as children have been from racial
minorities.
        "Nowhere is the international rule of law more clear than the prohibition on
the use of the death penalty against children.  The International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, which the United States has ratified, clearly
states that the 'sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed
by persons below the age of eighteen'," Hawkins explains.   "Indeed, every
 major human rights treaty in the world has the same express wording."
        Rev. Abrams  says he is concerned that Americans have become so fearful and
angry about violence in their communities  that they're no longer
contemplating the consequences of their responses to crime.
        "There is a feeding frenzy going on in America right now"  he says. "And we
are feeding on our youth."

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEMON:
        Q.      Would you state your name, please.
        A.      James French.
        Q.      Where are you employed?
        A.      City of Jackson Police Department, Violent Crimes Task Force.
        Q.      How long have you been employed there?
        A.      I've been employed with the police department a little over 18 years.
        Q.      Have you had reason to investigate a crime involving a Rudy Rhodes and
Santonio Berry?
        A.      Yes, sir, I have.
        Q.      Did you also investigate a crime involving an Azikiwe Kambule?
        A.      Yes, sir, I did.
        Q.      And they are all related in the same crime?
        A.      Yes, sir.
        Q.      Do you understand that because Mr. Kambule's attorney is not able to be
here today because of a conflict we're only going to proceed on Mr. Rhodes
and Mr. Berry?
        A.      Yes, sir.
        Q.      Okay. What crime had you investigated the defendant Rhodes and defendant
Berry for?
        A.      The initial crime was simply a missing person.  They were--they have been
arrested and charged. Mr Berry has been charged with armed robbery and
kidnapping, Mr. Rhodes has been charged with accessory to armed robbery and
accessory to kidnapping.
        Q.      And where did this crime take place or begin?
        A.      1523 County Line Road, Somerset Apartments.
        Q.      Is that in the First Judicial District of Hinds County?
        A.      Yes, sir.
        Q.      Could you please tell the Court the involvement in the crimes as to Rudy
Rhodes and Santonio Berry; and when necessary please speak to defendant
Azikiwe Kambule, also.
        A.      Yes, sir. Initially Pamela McGill was reported missing on the 25th of
September [sic]. We obtained a bank photo from the Trustmark Bank at County
Line Road, an ATM machine, showing Ms. McGill--the last know time that we
know that she was alive at 5:55 P.M. on that date. As she drives through
the--away from the ATM a white Mitsubishi driven by Mr. Berry, a clear facial
shot of him, pulls through the ATM. From that point on Ms. McGill has never
been seen. She had a meeting set up for 6:20--6:15 that day. The person that
was supposed to meet her did not arrive at her apartment until 6:20. Ms
McGill was not there at that time. She's never been seen from again. The--Ms.
McGill at the time she went through the bank was driving her 1993 red Dodge
Stealth. She withdrew $50.00 in cash from the bank, and there was a debit
against her account for $51.00, the extra one dollar against the account. We
began looking for the vehicle. We received information that an individual
from Laurel and two from Jackson were trying to sell the vehicle in Laurel on
a street called Lucas Street. We contacted Laurel P.D. Laurel P.D. began
looking for the vehicle. They found the vehicle parked on a parking lot at
Howard Industries in Laurel. This was on the 5th of February around 5:00 P.M.
The vehicle was processed for evidence by the Mississippi State Crime Lab.
Items missing from the vehicle were the car radio, a set of floor mats, and a
cellular telephone--Dodge Stealth floor mats. Also found in the car was a
spent hull from a Makarov pistol, a 9 by 18 Makarov style--Makarov style
pistol. They recovered other pieces of evidence. February the 6th a Mr.
Preston Ramsey contacted us and advised that he had received information that
Rudy Rhodes and two individuals from Jackson had taken the red Dodge Stealth
to an Oscar George in Laurel. Detective Windham with the Laurel P.D. was
contacted and asked to locate Oscar George. In the meantime, members of the
task force went to Laurel. On the 6th special agent--FBI agent Artis and
detective--and myself interviewed Oscar George. Oscar George stated that Rudy
Rhodes and two individuals that he thought to be from Jackson had tried to
sell him this red Dodge Stealth for a thousand dollars. On the 6th members of
the Violent Crimes Task Force and the Fugitive Task Force arrested Rudy
Rhodes. At 8:30 P.M. Rudy Rhodes signed a rights waiver form. This was
witnessed by FBI agent Hal Neilson, Mississippi Highway Patrol investigator
Tommy Squires, and myself. Rudy Rhodes then gave a written statement as to
this incident.
        Q.      Without getting into the--exactly what was said in the statement, could
you please tell the Court the effect of that statement?
        A.      The statement indicates that Azikiwe Kambule and Berry showed up at
Rhodes' apartment. They were driving a red Dodge Stealth. Rhodes indicated
that as soon as he saw it he knew that it was probably a stolen vehicle. They
wanted to go to Laurel. He had already planned to go to Laurel, so he allowed
them to follow. Rhodes and his girlfriend, Pammy Porter, rode in Rhodes' red
Dodge--in a red Plymouth Laser; and the red Dodge Stealth driven by Berry and
a passenger, Kambule, followed. Pammy Porter spent the night at her mother's
house. Berry, Kambule, and Rhodes spent the night, the night that Ms. McGill
first--missed her first appointment. The next day, Friday, Rhodes stated that
he took Kambule and Berry to Oscar George's business which is a repair shop,
auto repair shop; and they did in fact try to sell the car for a thousand
dollars. Santonio Berry removed the radio from the vehicle and placed it in
the trunk of the red Plymouth Laser that's jointly owned by Rudy Rhodes and a
Stacy Roy. While in Laurel, Santonio Berry and Azikiwe Kambule told Rhodes
that they had followed a woman driving from a bank to some apartment. They
made the woman move over and drove toward Raymond. They turned off the
highway toward Raymond on a long, dark road, made the woman get out, and
drove off. They did not tell Rhodes, according to his statement, that they
had murdered her. Super Bowl Sunday, which I believe is the 28th--they came
back to Jackson on Saturday. Pammy Porter drove the Plymouth Laser, and the
three individuals were in the car with her. And Super Bowl Sunday Berry went
back to Rhodes and said he wanted to go back to Laurel. Rhodes and Berry went
back to Laurel and moved the vehicle from an individual's house to the
parking lot at Howard Industries where they left it. And that's basically
Rhodes' statement.
        Q.      Okay. Did any of the others make any statements?
        A.      Yes, sir. Azikiwe Kambule when he was arrested by special agent Neilson,
investigator Squires, and myself made a statement that he and--to the effect
that he and Berry had in fact observed Pam McGill on the parking lot of the
Trustmark Bank at the corner of County Line and Wheatley. They were standing
outside of Berry's car about to use an ATM card themselves. Ms McGill drove
around them, pulled in the machine. Berry made a statement that he wanted
that car. They got back into Berry's car, followed her to the apartments.
Kambule said that it appeared to him that Ms. McGill was getting out of her
vehicle as if to check the mail, and at which point--
        Q.      This is back at her apartment?
        A.      At Somerset Apartments. Kambule stated that Berry used his Makarov pistol
to force Ms. Berry [sic] back into the car. He forced here through the
driver's seat into the passenger's seat of this vehicle. Berry got in behind
the driver's seat with the weapon on Ms. McGill. Kambule indicated that he
got into the passengers door and almost had to lie down to get behind the
from seat--behind the seat on the passenger's side. Berry drove. Kambule
again was right behind the seat. Ms. McGill was in the right, front seat.
They left Berry's Mitsubishi at Somerset Apartments. As they drove, Pam
McGill kept begging for them to just take the car and take her money and let
her go. According to Kambule, they went to a road down toward Raymond. Berry
stopped the car, made the woman get out, and  he told Kambule to turn the car
around. Kambule stayed in the car. Berry walked the woman into the woods.
Kambule tried to turn the car around. He cannot drive a straight shift and
could not get it turned around. Berry returned shortly; and Berry
stated--according the Kambule, Berry said that he had shot--he had made the
girl kneel down and shot her in the back of the head. They then went,
according to Kambule, went to Rhodes' apartment. There they left the Dodge
and had Rudy Rhodes take them back to where they had left the white
Mitsubishi. Berry drove the Mitsubishi to his apartment on Poplar Avenue.
They then returned to Rudy Rhodes' home and then went to Laurel. Kambule
tried to point out the road that--where the--where Ms. McGill had been
placed, but he was not successful.
        Q.      Has anyone else attempted to assist the police or the authorities in
finding Ms. McGill's body?
        A.      In--no, they all--
        Q.      Concerning the defendants.
        A.      We got statements from Cedric Bernard Jones and from a Brian Cooley. They
were with all three defendants on the Saturday night--excuse me--on the
Friday night following the abduction; and Santonio Berry showed Brian Cooley
the firearm. All three defendants showed these two witnesses the vehicle. At
that time it was--when they saw it, it was parked on the parking lot at Jones
County Junior College. They talked about the incident; and according to
Cooley and Jones, they indicated that they had forced the woman into the car,
taken her to a long, dark road and made her get out. Jones and Cooley
indicated they thought the woman was still alive when she was put out of the
vehicle. Pammy Porter was interviewed by agents Neilson and Detective Rainey,
and she indicated that she had in fact gone to Laurel, that when she
first--on the night of the incident when she returned home, she walked into
her apartment and heard Santonio Berry saying something to the effect "two
shots, pow, pow." She went on into the apartment. They wanted to go to
Laurel. They followed Porter and Rhodes to Laurel, that during the weekend
she did in fact overhear them saying that they had taken the car--taken the
woman, taken the car and put her out on a long, dark road. On the way back
from Laurel that Saturday, Pammy Porter was driving the vehicle with the
other three individuals in it. She was stopped in Mendenhall-on Highway 49 at
Mendenhall and issued a ticket for driving with no tag.
        Q.      How did the two defendants that abducted Ms. McGill receive their vehicle
back that they had parked at her apartment complex?
        A.      According to Kambule, Rhodes--they went--after they put Ms. McGill out,
they went to Rhodes' apartment. They got into Rhodes' car. Rhodes took them
to Somerset Apartments. Berry got into the Mitsubishi, drove the Mitsubishi
to Poplar Street where he had an apartment, and this is prior to going to
Laurel.
        Q.      I'm sorry. Where were the items that were taken from Ms. McGill's car
found?
        A.      The radio that was taken from Ms. McGill's car was found in the trunk of
Rudy Rhodes' car. He identified it as being the radio that came out of the
car. The cellular telephone was recovered by Laurel Police Department. An
individual turned it in, and an individual there whose name escapes me now
identified it as being the phone that came out of that car. The floor mats
from the vehicle were found in a mini storage building in Clinton during the
serving of a search warrant. So that' the only three items we've recovered
from the car. The Makarov pistol we believe to have been used in the incident
was found in the possession of Mr. Berry at the time he was arrested by
Clinton Police Department...
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. FORTNER:
        Q.      Jim, I've just got a few questions. How long after Kambule was arrested
did you arrest Mr. Berry?
        A.      Mr. Berry was arrested somewhere in the neighborhood of 5:15, 5:30 in the
morning.
        Q.      Did Mr. Berry make any statements to the police?
        A.      No, sir.
        Q.      None at all?
        A.      To my knowledge, no, sir.
        Q.      Are you the only person that attempted to ask him any questions, or did
you attempt to ask him any questions?
        A.      I was not present during the time he was arrested. I did see him
following his arrest. They brought him up to our office for processing into
the jail. He was advised of his rights, but he didn't want to talk. So to my
knowledge he's not made any statements whatsoever.
        Q.      Did Mr. Kambule--is Mr. Kambule the only witness you've spoken to or the
only person you or anybody else has spoken to that says Mr. Berry told him
that he killed the woman?
        A.      Yes, sir.
        Q.      All of the other people that you've talked to, the people down in Laurel,
the names that you listed, all of those people only say that Kambule and
Berry said that they took her out on a road and put her out. Is that right?
        A.      Yes.
        Q.      Do we even know for certain what road we're talking about here?
        A.      No.
        Q.      So do we even know for certain that if this woman was killed it occurred
here in Hinds County?
        A.      We know that the crime began in Hinds County.
        Q.      But we don't know where it ended. Is that right?
        A.      Correct.
        Q.      Right now my client is not charged with murder. Is that right?
        A.      Correct.
        Q.      And is it your intention to try to present a murder charge against him to
the grand jury?
        A.      Yes, sir.
        Q.      Did Mr. Kambule--what time was it when they went through the ATM?
        A.      5:55.
        Q.      And what time was it when they got to Mr. Rhodes' apartment?
        A.      There's some discrepancy on that.
        Q.      What does Rhodes say?
        A.      I think Rhodes and--I believe Rhodes said around 8:00 or 9:00 P.M.
        Q.      What about Kambule?
        A.      He didn't say.
        Q.      And Kambule testified--or in his statement he told you that--he told you
that he did see my client with a gun. Is that right?
        A.      Kambule? Yes, sir.
        Q.      How long--you said that Kambule said that Mr. Berry left the car with Ms.
McGill; and he tried to turn the car around, couldn't do so, and Berry
returned shortly.
        A.      Yes, sir.
        Q.      What is shortly?
        A.      I don't know.
        Q.      Was he any more specific than that?
        A.      No.
        Q.      Did Mr. Kambule tell you that while Mr. Berry and Ms. McGill were outside
of the vehicle that he heard a gunshot?
        A.      He specifically said he did not hear a gunshot.
BY MR. FORTNER:  That's all.

MADISON COUNTY WILL TRY SUSPECTS IN MCGILL SLAYING

[Note:  This is a copy of an article that ran in Jackson, Mississippi's
Clarion-Ledger Neewspaper on April 5, 1995]

        Pamela McGill's suspected killers will be tried in Madison County, officials
said Thursday.
        Investigators said they don't plan to directly file charges related to
McGill's slaying against Santonio Berry, 21, and Azikiwe Kambule, 17, but
will present the case to the grand jury as a capital murder punishable by the
death penalty.
        "I requested the Madison County District Attorney take the case and he's
agreed to do that," said Hinds County District Attorney, Ed Peters.
        "The family, from the beginning, has expressed a desire that the people
charged get the death penalty and the best way is to send it to another
county," Peters said.
        McGill, 31, disappeared Jan. 25. Police say the incident began in Hinds
County, where she was kidnapped, and ended in Madison County, where she was
slain.
        "Both counties would have jurisdiction," Peters said.
        Police say Berry wanted her sports car and he and Kambule kidnapped her from
her Jackson apartment. Kambule told police Berry drove the car to a deserted
road outside Jackson and shot McGill in the head after making her walk into
the woods and kneel.
        Berry, Kambule and Rudy Rhodes, 19, were arrested Feb. 7. Berry and Kambule
were charged with armed robbery and kidnapping, Rhodes was charged as an
accessory.
        Rhodes is accused of arranging to sell McGill's red 1993 Dodge Stealth in
Laurel; investigators say Pammy Porter, 19, Rhodes' fiancee, also knew of the
crime. Porter also is charged as an accessory.
        Madison County Coroner Alex Breeland said an autopsy confirmed McGill was
shot in the back of the head. The body was released to her family Thursday.
        McGill's body was found Thursday in a wooded area near North County Line
Road just inside Madison County after Berry pinpointed the general location
for investigators.
        Two previous searches, based on Kambule's vague description of the site,
failed.
        Hinds County Sheriff Malcolm McMillin said he had no preference which county
will try the case.
        "My position is there's good judges and good juries in Hinds and Madison
counties," he said.
        Peters sees things differently.
        "The jurors in Hinds County have a reputation for refusing to vote for the
death penalty," he said. "Certain judges in Hinds County have gotten so
prejudiced against the prosecution that they won't even allow confessions to
be entered as evidence."

Hello POETICS --
(there, i did it)

Also might suggest _American Dreams_ by Sapphire, publ. by Vintage Books.
A wide range of voices from urban america, growing up, and a considerable
sampling of groups in our Tossed Salad.  Others on the list might know
more specifics on the book, as I've (eek) only read a handful of pages so
far.

Hey Maria et al,

I believe the Cullen poem is called "Incident."  Somone (I can't remember
the artist's name) covered it on an album recently.  I brought that in to
play for my class the day we discussed the poem, and it was a great way
to get the students into it.  It may have been Ani DiFranco--does anyone
know if that's right?  Also in the first Nuyorican anthology (the one
edited by Algarin and Pinero) there are two poems by a young poet, Jorge
Lopez, which may be interesting because they are actually written by a kid.

Perhaps the "speed" discussion has run its course but just wanted to point
out by way of postscript (sorry if it's already been mentioned) bp Nichol's
treatment of it in "Probable Systems 18" (_art facts_) -- an amazing series
of dream commentaries which constructs (to quote) "a number of numbered
energy routes and details them in terms of acceleration & deceleration."
What interests me is the way he *maps* his "Accelerator and decelerator
calculations", suggesting a treatment of speed (motion) and locale (space)
within the same equation.  "What this map gives us access to is an
understanding of 'the speed of thot'..."  ---> a speed map, which as he
writes earlier points to "the ability to analyze reading at a finer level of
detail i.e. the change of tempo from letter to letter in any cluster of
letters (be they words or more abstract groupings)."

An amazing poem (and book) for any who haven't read it.  (Available, by the
way, through Chax.)

For Janet Gray:

        Two writers who have much material which may be of interest, use
are Joseph Bruchac and Leslie Marmon Silko. Excellent writers both.
Joseph Bruchac has also written many childrens' books presenting Native
American texts.

        Though not poems (more prose poems, really) two excellent
presentations of growing up in a marginalized community are Jack
Kerouac's Visions of Gerard and Doctor Sax. Visions of Gerard especially
has a polyphony of sounds in its movement among Nashua and Lowell
Quebecois and American English.

        As my Pepere used to say, thank God for Kerouac--now Americans
know Quebecois can be more than hockey players and lumberjacks.

         Lowell now has along with the Quebecois and Greek and Irish
communities Kerouac wrote of a vital and growing Cambodian community.

        Comme on dit:   Vive les differences!

What do you see as the Andrews' two essentially different approaches?
I've always thought of his work as largely having all of its ducks in

I've looked at works like Corona (1973) and Film Noir (1978) as working with
reader/audience in ways significantly different from the work by Andrews that
I've seen over the last few years. Film Noir uses the page itself as instrument
of reception -- typography/layout questions carrying a certain amount of weight
This does not, it seems, become instrumental in the Andrews texts I've reviewed
more recently. The characteristics of Corona are just beyond my reach at
present -- I've not looked at it for some years, and shall make further
comments tomorrow once having done so -- but when I read anything else by
Andrews, that text always whispers to me as though from a separate carriage.

Perhaps others will remark on Corona while I revisit it.

Gale,

--in terms of politics and reception--how would you describe the force or
weight of Andrews's syntax--in recent work--

              <lease@HUSC.HARVARD.EDU>

In work from the early-mid period of this decade, I received the work as being
driven by a manic "found language" machine, fed by logical sentence structure
with unexpected content <I cheese my drawers>, unexpected turns within a
larger sentence structure <Most of life is just pre-school anyway; paste like
that, money should be detached from ego -- creme, no sugar, no urine, like the
junior mints of a previous century; I'm nothing more than a noise gate.> In
<I cheese my drawers>, which continues, there's something akin to a confession/
admission, but of what? With <Most of life...>, there's the kind of statement
start-point that could be the basis for a best-selling self-help book, but
what follows distracts the reader (or at least this reader) from staying with
that "thought" -- and becomes centered on "I'm nothing more than a noise
gate." So then, intersperse statements of "politics" -- <Woman's place =
sexual deviance, doesn't it have pockets?> <in America country means white> --
give the reader the open-door as to read something "ironically," "straight"
"meaningfully meaningless" <Stalin's genius consisted of not french-kising:
sometimes I want to be in crud.> -- the work in relation to the political pull
seems to be "in the mix" -- but how does "narrator" or "voice" play in
Andrews? The tone is awash with layers of urbanity, hipness, coyness,
reportage, quasi-reportage, etc. So, the poltical statements may resonate
when the poem is set down -- or the politics may be in destablizing the very
nature of received communication  (or at least opening up the potential).
The reader, depending upon the degree to which s/he has already come to grips
with "received communication structures") will converge upon the text in a
hermeneutics of deciphering. And what is deciphered has indicators, surely,
witness <Biko/Biko/Biko> as the repeated word possibly out of the mouth of
a parrot; it holds a primacy in visual space toward the end of the poem, so a
"mouthing" by the parrot seems to suggest the yearning of the reader for
a certain justice in South Africa pulls the political into focus once more.
Of course, the poem doesn't end there -- too determined for the reader, but
it resonates from there. (The poem I'm reacting to is Stalin's Genius,
selected as the Hoover anthology was most readily available as "Guide to
Bruce Andrews" this summer afternoon).

Now, spacing on the page plays a subtle role here. In Film Noir, for
instance, I sense spacing as my primary way into the text at hand.

Subject:      Re: growing up poems

Dear Janet S. Gray,
   The following most quickly come to mind as being fresh and accessible
without being simplistic:

Early 20th-century, Lower Eastside, NYC/Brownsville, Brooklyn Jewish
childhood:
Charles Reznikoff, Part III ("Early History of a Writer") of "By the Well of
Living and Seeing", available in _Poems1918-1975: The Complete Poems of
Charles Reznikoff_, Seamus Cooney, ed. (Black Sparrow 1989), pp. 137-78.

Bi-racial and sexuality issues from an Asian American feminist perspective,
set largely in NY and Hawaii:
KIMIKO HAHN, _Earshot_ (Hanging Loose 1992) and _Unbearable Heart (Kaya
Production1995), poems abt childhood scattered throughout.

Growing up gay, Filipino, and proto-diva in Hawaii:
R. Zamora Linmark, _Rolling the Rs_ (Kaya 1995)

Chinese American family life and searches to recover a personalized Chinese
American West Coast history:
Alan Chong Lau, _Songs for Jadina_ (Greenfield Review Press 1980, out of
print)

Childhood years in a Japanese American concentration camp during World War 2:
Lawson Fusao Inada, _Legends from Camp_ (Coffee House 1993).  (A wonderful
reader for student audiences by the way; teaches at Southern Oregon State in
Ashlans.)

From _Premonitions_ (WKL888, ed. [20% discounted copies can be ordered
directly from me]):
Growing up in 1960s NY Chinatown:
FRANCES CHUNG, first eight of the nine poems, pp. 50-57.
Lesbian schooldays:
ANN KONG, "Ponies and Spanish Guitars", pp. 152-54.
Childhood in Vietnam during the war and moving to the U.S. as an adoptee:
CHRISTIAN LANGWORTHY, five poems, pp. 206-220.
Sexual tensions and violence in multi-racial Hawaiian high school settings:
LOIS-ANN YAMANAKA, four poems, pp. 412-423.

Warning:
Although the huge _New Worlds of Literature:  Writings from America's Many
Cultures_ (Norton 1989, 1994) includes several genres of prose and poetry and
is pedagogically tempting to some for its breadth of ethnic constituencies,
Norton anthology-style questions, and teacher's guide, I find most of the
work plain boring-a prime example of homogenized, reduced, non-specific,
linguistically unadventurous textbook multiculturalism.  (The second edition
is, however, better than the first.)  Some of the work is good or useful
(including maybe my own poem!), but you have to wade through so much to find
it.

Hope this is of use.

You could try and get hold of one of Roma Potiki's books. (New Zealand Maori
poet) She is 'accessible', and also at times pretty bloody thought provoking
and good. Also for accessibility, Dancing on the Rim of the Earth. 'An
Anthology of Contemporary Northwest Native American Writing.' ed Andrea
Lerner. (Arizona Press) is pretty didactic at times, but also has some good
stuff. (Can pm me if you want more info about Roma Potiki)

>        A.      I've been employed with the police department a little over
18 years.
>        Q.      Have you had reason to investigate a crime involving a Rudy

>        Q.      And they are all related in the same crime?
>        A.      Yes, sir.
>        Q.      Do you understand that because Mr. Kambule's attorney is
not able to be

>        A.      Yes, sir.
>        Q.      Okay. What crime had you investigated the defendant Rhodes
and defendant
>Berry for?
>        A.      The initial crime was simply a missing person.  They
were--they have been
>arrested and charged. Mr Berry has been charged with armed robbery and
>kidnapping, Mr. Rhodes has been charged with accessory to armed robbery and
>accessory to kidnapping.
>        Q.      And where did this crime take place or begin?
>        A.      1523 County Line Road, Somerset Apartments.
>        Q.      Is that in the First Judicial District of Hinds County?
>        A.      Yes, sir.
>        Q.      Could you please tell the Court the involvement in the
crimes as to Rudy
>Rhodes and Santonio Berry; and when necessary please speak to defendant
>Azikiwe Kambule, also.
>        A.      Yes, sir. Initially Pamela McGill was reported missing on
the 25th of
>September [sic]. We obtained a bank photo from the Trustmark Bank at County
>Line Road, an ATM machine, showing Ms. McGill--the last know time that we
>know that she was alive at 5:55 P.M. on that date. As she drives through
>the--away from the ATM a white Mitsubishi driven by Mr. Berry, a clear facial
>shot of him, pulls through the ATM. From that point on Ms. McGill has never
>been seen. She had a meeting set up for 6:20--6:15 that day. The person that
>was supposed to meet her did not arrive at her apartment until 6:20. Ms
>McGill was not there at that time. She's never been seen from again. The--Ms.
>McGill at the time she went through the bank was driving her 1993 red Dodge
>Stealth. She withdrew $50.00 in cash from the bank, and there was a debit
>against her account for $51.00, the extra one dollar against the account. We
>began looking for the vehicle. We received information that an individual
>from Laurel and two from Jackson were trying to sell the vehicle in Laurel on
>a street called Lucas Street. We contacted Laurel P.D. Laurel P.D. began
>looking for the vehicle. They found the vehicle parked on a parking lot at
>Howard Industries in Laurel. This was on the 5th of February around 5:00 P.M.
>The vehicle was processed for evidence by the Mississippi State Crime Lab.
>Items missing from the vehicle were the car radio, a set of floor mats, and a
>cellular telephone--Dodge Stealth floor mats. Also found in the car was a
>spent hull from a Makarov pistol, a 9 by 18 Makarov style--Makarov style
>pistol. They recovered other pieces of evidence. February the 6th a Mr.
>Preston Ramsey contacted us and advised that he had received information that
>Rudy Rhodes and two individuals from Jackson had taken the red Dodge Stealth
>to an Oscar George in Laurel. Detective Windham with the Laurel P.D. was
>contacted and asked to locate Oscar George. In the meantime, members of the
>task force went to Laurel. On the 6th special agent--FBI agent Artis and
>detective--and myself interviewed Oscar George. Oscar George stated that Rudy
>Rhodes and two individuals that he thought to be from Jackson had tried to
>sell him this red Dodge Stealth for a thousand dollars. On the 6th members of
>the Violent Crimes Task Force and the Fugitive Task Force arrested Rudy
>Rhodes. At 8:30 P.M. Rudy Rhodes signed a rights waiver form. This was
>witnessed by FBI agent Hal Neilson, Mississippi Highway Patrol investigator
>Tommy Squires, and myself. Rudy Rhodes then gave a written statement as to
>this incident.
>        Q.      Without getting into the--exactly what was said in the
statement, could
>you please tell the Court the effect of that statement?
>        A.      The statement indicates that Azikiwe Kambule and Berry
showed up at
>Rhodes' apartment. They were driving a red Dodge Stealth. Rhodes indicated
>that as soon as he saw it he knew that it was probably a stolen vehicle. They
>wanted to go to Laurel. He had already planned to go to Laurel, so he allowed
>them to follow. Rhodes and his girlfriend, Pammy Porter, rode in Rhodes' red
>Dodge--in a red Plymouth Laser; and the red Dodge Stealth driven by Berry and
>a passenger, Kambule, followed. Pammy Porter spent the night at her mother's
>house. Berry, Kambule, and Rhodes spent the night, the night that Ms. McGill
>first--missed her first appointment. The next day, Friday, Rhodes stated that
>he took Kambule and Berry to Oscar George's business which is a repair shop,
>auto repair shop; and they did in fact try to sell the car for a thousand
>dollars. Santonio Berry removed the radio from the vehicle and placed it in
>the trunk of the red Plymouth Laser that's jointly owned by Rudy Rhodes and a
>Stacy Roy. While in Laurel, Santonio Berry and Azikiwe Kambule told Rhodes
>that they had followed a woman driving from a bank to some apartment. They
>made the woman move over and drove toward Raymond. They turned off the
>highway toward Raymond on a long, dark road, made the woman get out, and
>drove off. They did not tell Rhodes, according to his statement, that they
>had murdered her. Super Bowl Sunday, which I believe is the 28th--they came
>back to Jackson on Saturday. Pammy Porter drove the Plymouth Laser, and the
>three individuals were in the car with her. And Super Bowl Sunday Berry went
>back to Rhodes and said he wanted to go back to Laurel. Rhodes and Berry went
>back to Laurel and moved the vehicle from an individual's house to the
>parking lot at Howard Industries where they left it. And that's basically
>Rhodes' statement.
>        Q.      Okay. Did any of the others make any statements?
>        A.      Yes, sir. Azikiwe Kambule when he was arrested by special
agent Neilson,
>investigator Squires, and myself made a statement that he and--to the effect
>that he and Berry had in fact observed Pam McGill on the parking lot of the
>Trustmark Bank at the corner of County Line and Wheatley. They were standing
>outside of Berry's car about to use an ATM card themselves. Ms McGill drove
>around them, pulled in the machine. Berry made a statement that he wanted
>that car. They got back into Berry's car, followed her to the apartments.

Makarov pistol

>        A.      We got statements from Cedric Bernard Jones and from a
Brian Cooley. They

>County Junior College. They talked about the incident; and according to
>Cooley and Jones, they indicated that they had forced the woman into the car,
>taken her to a long, dark road and made her get out. Jones and Cooley
>indicated they thought the woman was still alive when she was put out of the

>Laurel. They followed Porter and Rhodes to Laurel, that during the weekend

Subject:      Re: speed & poetry (fwd)

Thanks D Chirot for comments on speed!  !!!    Slow reading has long
been a pleasure, like a couple of hours reading a page of prose (I
remember doing this kind of reading some years ago for preference
and being so delighted with it that I could not bear to read at
academic rates of page- per - 45 - seconds for many years).

 Regarding slow looking, looking like a painter looks and
similar thoughts see James Elkins: The Object Stares Back (Simon
& Shuster, NY, March 1996) which a friend put in my hands
 recently as a loan only. (Forcing fast reading on me, really.) The
 modes of attention with ears and eyes are various and too little
explored I believe.

  An hour looking at a Rembrandt portrait (say)
is barely a substitute for having the same portrait in your house on
your wall for thirty years, some days seeing it fleetingly with little
attention, some days absorbed by it for some indefinite time -- the
conditions of looking it was made for.

 Ill and in bed one black and white ink drawing on the wall
 opposite was enough to keep me happy for a couple of hours
one day this week.  I watched the six rough oriental-looking brush
marks and four ink splashes shift in their varied and incomplete suggestions
 of images, more engagingly than rabbit-duck readings of the "same" drawing.

For sheer slowness, Aram Saroyan one-word poems, or Clark Coolidge's
two word poems are of that order?

But then in midst of  longer texts I recall falling over the two words
"monopoly polopony" of Ron Silliman (isn't that in Ketjak?), a hook,
I'd say, on which I was hooked for quite a long while.

Memory is fun that way. Like dreams, so hard to get it all down as it
presents itself to the wandering "mind" (a retelling as story-teller
of the intimate contents, all that soul to soul intention of openness
of J Kerouac).  It all comes at you to quick and too dense and too
elaborate for slow sequential speech. Imagine telling what each image
in a quick-cut movie says before the next image hits.

Cough, cough cough, I'm going back to bed.

The sense of words floating -- having negative space to cushion -- will
perhaps increase the "slow reading" Tony Green was suggeting happens when
he looks at one-word or two-word poems -- & gives the words a level of primacy
I find less apparent in the denser text fields I've been more likely to
see from Bruce Andrews in more recent years. Better or worse? That is
not the point. What the reader is asked to do -- how gaps are formed, seems
more pertinent.

Bruce Andrews thread ad nauseum?

Corona seems to hold together a more fragile vocal register -- the swaggering,
propulsive energy in "stalins genius" (quoted from, in passing, yesterday) is
little be found here. There's a hitch in the swing, to use baseball lingo
here, where the poem becomes, at many turns, about the _hitch_.

find it
never have
have it

reads section 17 of this sequence, and the movement between search and
possession/and the possibility of possession leads to wonderment in a
precisely tentative ground.

To read section 19:

my costumes

is to read a form of self-representation that cannot be pinned down. The
"my" is a multivalenced and the "costumes" equally so. These two words,
then, could be read as "referential" in a "sincere" sense, "exploratory"
of what "sincerity" might represent, or simply a passing reference to
any _my_ (not necessarily the "speaker/author/narrator" -- possibly just
a passing "Joe"/"Joanne") or to no specific _my_ whatsoever. The "cosume" is
equally open -- a reader might think of the writer wrapping himself (in this
case a himself) in the costume of poet, of "a creature" (there's lots of
"nature" blooming or emerging in other passages), etc.

The driving force for me in the poem, is the energy constructions through
the specificity of word selections in a taut field -- so that the page
reverberates many pages later (and earlier) as one passes through from
one field to the next. Context is -- s p a c e d  o u t -- given a very
real breathing room. The gaps are laden. In later Andrews, the propulsion
factor seems the constructive force -- the gaps are in the inability to
process all of the information that comes careening toward the reader. So,
yes, I'd say that Andrews' work has changed over the last 20-some years.

Those of you who know Bruce Andrews and have talked with him about his work
can nod happily, saying, "Gale Nelson is an eccentric reader." But, alas,
this is where I'm at as such reader, eccentric, but interested.

Just an aside to Gale's meditations on Bruce Andrews: at the Hoboken
Russ-American conference, Andrews read right after Jackson Mac Low.
The similarities, to my uneducated ear (I'v read very little of either
of them) were interesting.  In both of them, the long riveted lines
of vocabulary, full of venom & glee, like a glossary of the Byzantine
empire read aloud by aliens from outer space.  Only Mac Low seemd
more wry & somber; in Andrews the glee factor was higher.  Ecclesiastes
& King David, respectively. - Henry Gould

All those new Northwestern collections, & much else.

1. _Paradise & Method: Poetry & Praxis_ by Bruce Andrews, Northwestern,
$16.95. Andrews' essays & interviews over two decades. "A syndicalism of
syntax and reference -- and of their intertwining that looks out beyond the
self-enclosures of the text toward an implicating of wider social (& bodily)
horizons. The vectors outward, an arrow array, love's body, from language's
social body."

2. _Why Write?_ by Paul Auster, Burning Deck, $10.
Little book of essays including title piece, wonderful reminiscence of
Reznikoff, & "Twenty-five Sentences Containing the Words _Charles

o' text too.

fine Kelsey St. artist/poet production. "The culture beats the brow with
equal parts spectacle and punishment, often in the same sitcom
(coming to a theater _in you_) . . .

5. _Opposing Poetries  Volume One: Issues and Institutions_ by Hank Lazer,
Northwestern University Press, $16.95. "A broad awareness of the
decentralization of poetry production, as well as an established critique of
the limited nature of today's professionalized and institutionalized poetry
writing, have had a salutary effect on attempts to describe American poetry."
This collection is varied & engaging. Thanks Hank.

6. _Opposing Poetries  Volume Two: Readings_ by Hank Lazer, Northwestern,
$16.95. Essays on Bernstein, DuPlessis, Silliman, Andrews, Hejinian, Howe,

Not that I've forgotten our last blissful night at the Bide-A-Wee in

George Starbuck died Thursday morning at his home in Tuscaloosa at
age 65 after a twenty year bout with Parkinson's disease.  A fine
poet and generous person, George directed the graduate writing
programs in creative writing at Iowa (where, ages ago, he hired
Kathleen Fraser) and at Boston University.  While at SUNY-Buffalo in
1963, he initiated a successful challenge of New York's Feinberg
loyalty-oath law.  After a semester as writer-in-residence, George
decided to live in Tuscaloosa.  For the past several years, he has
been a kind friend, much valued for his learning, his conversation,
and his advocacy of a wide range of poetries.

"Postmodern cyber criticism collides with cyber cool in this smart,
savvy, and, dare I say, hot looking journal of technology, media,
and society. The intention of _SPEED_ "is to contribute toward a
democratic discourse of technology and media, one that is always
focused upon the material conditions of life that technologies and
media constitute and demand, and yet does not lose sight of the
power of ideas to change those conditions." That is, wired culture
gets self-reflexive, and it's about time."

--from GNN, on-line Whole Internet Catalog

1. SPEED 1.3: AIRPORTS AND MALLS HAS ARRIVED

"The globe shrinks for those who own it; for the displaced or
dispossessed, the migrant or refugee, no distance is more awesome
than the few feet across borders or frontiers." -- Homi K. Bhabha.

"This version of the SPEED periodical/software concerns the
transformation of social space by information technologies, and the
value of dystopian mapping practices in accounting for the re-
locations of personalized politics that those transformations
demand....

"A sheer centralization of aesthetics signals an empowered domain
of inhabited information. Perhaps no social space serves to
exemplify this development more so than the airport. It stands for
the globalization of participant space under the sign of hegemonic
capital circulation, and of the standardization of capital and
circulation under the sign of information. The mechanical and
totemic work that it does in such service wishes to succeed at, and
complete, a utopian theater. But something is still messy. For Us,
the story that it, as a place, tells about itself and asks us to
play a part in, suffers a vanity of false resolution and improper
closure. Its utopian infantilization of our bodies which it
mediates does not finally succeed in convincing us that the global
system of temporized space it links is quite truly so seamless
and resolved. For most, this was never even a question. For all,
this is part of the rude claim made by the infomatic revolution
in the built environment....."

2. SPEED 1.4: SPECIAL ISSUE: ON PAUL VIRILIO

We are currently reviewing abstracts and proposals for articles for a
future transmission of _SPEED_ (WWW-specific projects encouraged)  on
the critical significance of the work of Paul Virilio. In extremely
diverse arenas Virilio's cybernetic systems theory of the social has
arranged the horizons of wildly unlikely moments of questioning.  As his
vision of interpretation/accusation crosses the spectrum of
disciplinary knowledges (while being at "home" in none), we now  hear
literary critics speaking of the military origins of the city-state,
newscasters phrasing a "Nintendo War," historians of science  commenting
on the phenomenology of electronic banking,  architectural theorists
conceiving "the velocity" of airport space, and computer industry
professionals discussing the political history  of the film projector.
Certainly these peculiar arrangements are not to  be entirely credited
to (blamed on?) Virilio, but they do suggest that  his vocabulary is
significant beyond the relatively narrow concerns  of a "Virilio
Studies." We hope, therefore, to both interrogate and  expand what it is
possible to make "Virilio" say.


-----------------------------------


3. SPEED 1.5: FETISHISM: HOW CYBORGS FUCK?

"Object Relations" becomes a difficult strategy for love in a
virtualizing world. Difficult, but still preferred. "Fetishism: How
Cyborgs Fuck?" will cut between the technologies of fetishism and the
fetishisms of technology -- from the techno-eroticism of B/D and S/M to
the B/D and S/M of postmodern advertising. Future Sex? Yes, thank you. As
long as we can keep our black patent-leather Newton PDA's! "That's a big
hard drive you've got there, General!" The issue is desire, or rather
desire transformed into technology's modes of enframing and poesis. The
moments that these actions are made for "devices" ("ooh, it's so smooth")
and not "technologies" ("we've got 98% efficiency, sir") become even more
to the point. This issue will include projects relating to, but not
exclusive to, Cyborg Studies, techno-psychoanalysis, transfeminism, S&M
Studies, CyberSex, the cinematics of just-in-time alienation, and all
other general economies of dissemination. WWW-based proposals are
particularly encouraged.

4. ABOUT SPEED

SPEED provides a forum for the critical investigation of
technology, media and society. Our intention is to contribute toward
a democratic discourse of technology and media, one that is always
focused upon the material conditions of life that technologies and
media constitute and demand, and yet does not lose sight of the
power of ideas to change those conditions. We feel that as media of
various kinds become more ubiquitous, what it means to live with
and talk about a "medium" changes and expands, and so do the
critical vocabularies of interpreting what those transformations
indicate. Our primary goal in that effort is to foster a cross-
fertilization of ideas between communities of people in the
"academy" and "industry" too often separated, not by interest or
common concern, but by artificially imposed disciplinary and
organizational boundaries. We think that _SPEED_ is a promising
step toward making these institutional boundaries more permeable,
and a critical politics of "mediated sociality" more powerful.

Subject:      poetry & speed; poetry on speed; & a 180 turn around for love

I don't think anyone has mentioned Alice Notley's texts with regards to
poetry/speed/slowness.
"it seems that" "their composition" "as compilations of" "quotes" "from
various" "though unknown" "sources are both" "interesting & resistent" "to
speed" "reading"
                  -& writing, I might add. typing all those quote marks takes
TIME. reading them does as well, which is my point.

poetry ON speed seems more fun. now, I'm not necessarily talking about
narcotics, certainly a possibility (& reality I'm sure), but other options
could be writing while driving, writing really fast, writing while driving
really fast, or reading/performing really fast. these would not be cultural
products of our hyper-whatever (hypertext?-writing that can be transmitted
very fast) society that demands instant access &c, but conscious decisions of
an inherent speed of some things, while there is a slowness to others. to
make the anology with colors: I can't imagine a slow red or yellow, nor a
fast brown. interestingly blue seems to swing both ways. (cf: bill gass "on
being blue")

as for the other: stand up & turn around. thanks deb.
see ya.

Does anyone know what is happenong (or has happened) to the art collection the

dispute between the two WCW sons as what to do w/ them. Wm. Eric Willaims, who
lived there, did not want to sell them, claiming they were part of his house.
Brother Paul, thought they should be put on the market. Any fan of WCW should go

I realize this is probably an old issue, but having tried to go to a few
"poetry slams", I find it is like watching wrestling on TV, and has very
little to do with poetry and a lot to do with the lowest common
denominator of audience entertainment/jacking off.  Does anyone else
feel this competitive/entertainment trend in poetry readings (in an
effort toward popularity) is the wrong direction to move in...?

Comments: cc: David Benedetti <dbenedet@UNM.EDU>

David,

Wow, what a treat to see your name.

A few years ago I saw you in front of E.J.'s and told you that I liked a
poem of yours that I had seen in some mag somewhere and you were kind
enough to give me a copy of your book "defense mechanism".

That night a friend of mine, whom I had been friends with for years, came
over to my place on Silver (or was it Lead?) and we sat around and smoked
and drank and read aloud your poems.  Actually I read them aloud and he
listened.  He was someone who had never ever expressed any interest in
poetry before the whole time I had known him.  He was quite taken by your
work, most particularly the poem 'REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS'.  After reading
your book he expressed an interest for the first time in reading some of my
writing.  Something he had never ever done before.

So I wanted to express my gratitude once again for your kindness.

As for slams I think it is important to realize that while there is a
certain amount of truth to what you say it is not the whole truth.  I have
on a few occasions been to slams where the winner is none other than the
best writer there.  The vast majority of the time the winner is the best
performer and sometimes the winner is someone who is equally good at both
writing and performing but sometimes, rarely, the writer wins out.

Rather than say the "wrong direction to move in" maybe it would be more
appropriate to say it is "another direction to move in".

Mayakovsky, while a still great writer, made his name when he started
because he was handsome and dashing and one hell of a performer, not to
mention a shrewd politician (which in my experience has a whole hell of
alot more to do with winning modern day slams than either writing skill or
performing ability).  And while some of the dadaists did some great things
outside of performance value it nevertheless played a vital role in their
work as well as in the "Theatre of Cruelty".  Also I believe Joy in your
department has expressed, in David's book last year, the sentiment that her
work with "Poetic Justice" is another form of her poetry, albeit with a
groove.  Perhaps slams are simply another media.  I don't know.

And actually in my experience slams and the spoken word movement has not
occured because of a desire towards popularity (certainly that plays a
role) so much as a desire to read and be heard in spite of being shut out
of the "academy" (refer back to politics).

There's actually a guy in Austin named Whammo who approaches his readings
like they were a wrestling match and he even looks like a wrestler and some
of his poems are some of the most interesting political word play skewers I
have ever heard.

in connection w/ a piece on slams i'm reading an essay by musicologist simon
frith called "the good, the bad, and the indifferent: defending popular culture
from the populists."  i'm struggling w/ the issue of "evaluation."  frith argues
something that seems obvious once it's said, but still sounds novel when i read
it; that everyone is making aesthetic judgments, but the criteria differ from
person to person, class to class, venue to venue.  he thinks that students and
scholars of pop and mass culture who disavow any need for acknowledgeing the
aesthetic are being disingenuous.  i haven't finished the article yet
(diacritics 1991) but it's easy to read and pretty smart.  talking to this
crowd, it might be old news, since POETIX seems by + large pretty invested in
aesthetic judgment, but for me it's useful.  so, slams are aesthetic events that
involve judgment (that's the whole format --ranking, judging, etc), but the
aesthetic criteria might differ overlappingly with/from other poetry contexts.

someone was telling me today about a kaja silverman book he was reading that
discussed a fassbinder movie in which a masochist has just had a sex change
operation to please his sadist/lover; his lover is humiliating him in front of
the mirror, taunting him/her about his/her new face and body and says, "what do
you see when you look in the mirror?"  the masochist responds, "I see myself
loving you."  silverman apparently cites this as an example of the egolessness
of the masochist who can only see his/her existence in relation to the other (or
something like that); to me, it was a moment characterized by its sheer
POETICITY.

i know there's a connection between the two preceding paragraphs but i'm too
tired to articulately theorize it.  something about context, reception,
understanding of what "poetry" is, and a corresponding aesthetic judgment. kinda
like seeing that 10yrold girl read that poem to her father at his funeral that i
wrote about here a few months ago.

Comments: To: FLUXLIST@scribble.com
In-Reply-To:  <199608161516.LAA03649@monticello.path.med.umich.edu>

        Interactive Technology suddenly begins to require governing
bureaucracies to be accountable to more than special-interest lobbies.
Other essential cultures will take longer to free themselves from
similarily imposed sanctions; keeping the channels of disbelief open will
only assist the maturation process. This is even apparent in the
academe-art-world where it is no longer possible to retract and posture
behind hallowed 'accredited' texts and papers. The usual claims of
singular intellectual and historically verifiable dominance in lieu of
anything-else, -- which can only be, after-all, facile emotional,
untested, unverifiable,... tripe!

        The World is now subsuming this haughty one-track regime; all
approaches are now equally valid. The bureaucratic 'art-speak' of the
old-world still indignantly bristles at the mention of any challenge. A
fresh critical language/practise has only begun to break from the ossified
jargon of the hierarchical/insipid academy. Already, the patentedly absurd
notion of 'art-movements and schools' is being parodied on IRC -- witness,
the Fluxus-Channel, in which participants deliver-up the
pseudo-intellectual posturings of yester-year, and thereby inadvertently
prompt the Fluxus-Artist-Bot to chime-in with its 'personal' anecdotes of
that pseudo-period. This mawkish humor is sure to spawn other similarly
'specialized' channels.

        Meanwhile, the remaining art-experts continue to parry, thrust and
quibble over verifiable historical details and 'textual evidence' that
either supports or dismisses their esteemed positions. But, who knows,
some of these players may still be real, and thereby motivated to cling to
the vestiges of this morbid, cloying ritual. Perhaps this is the sadistic
appeal of these 'period-channels'-- that suddenly, the predatory, selfish,
stagnant, internal mechanizations of the art-academy are laid-bare --
their crusty orifices now swollened shut...

        Which leads me to mention a current project of mine... (I
introduce it now in part because of an inherent elegance which exceeds a
cohesion of facts;) which is not to imply that art is yet possible-- real
practise must still 'span the current cultural spasm.' It's still not
clear whether art-presented through the Net escapes this stultifying
condition elsewhere-- that is to say, that art-now can be seen, but
then-instantly vanishes within the larger culture without reverberation or
consequence. Anyway-- I've finally 'realized' some ideas that I initiated
ten-years-ago; I've also found a probable-use for digital-art-image
filters. The work consists of a set of collected imagery through various
quirky industrial machineries which I've 'stylistically-generalized' with
Art-Effects Filters. Once on-screen they look especially appealing and
uneasily nostalgic from across the room. I think this imagery would be
well-suited to body-tattoos (blue-black as in the illustrations). Let me
know if you have one done!  <<http://www.teleport.com/~bbrace/bbrace.html

I'm growing to enjoy the slams more and more as time goes on. I
started out opposed to them, but have sort of come around. Last
night, my ensemble performed as the feature at the Dallas slam, and I
was one of the judges.

The poetry has a wider range than I might expect -- there's seeming
to be less in-your-face assault of late and more personal material.
As necessitated by the rules, the best of the performances are very
focused, some toward audience assault, and some much quieter
material. In fact, the older-style assault poetry is getting lower
scores of late, and everyone seems to be getting tired of the endless
array of Maggie Estep clones. This is leading to a wider range.

For a while, I hosted a quite popular poetry event that was pretty much the
anthithesis of the slams, and got much of its attendance from people
who, having started at the slams, were interested in moving into
other areas. (That it fell apart was due not to the material, but to
personality conflicts among the hosts.)

I think its very good that some poetry is moving toward audience
entertainment. Fortunately, it's not the only direction that it's
leading, and it's opening doors to other possibilities.  Our
ensemble's work is perhaps closest to the work of the Four Horsemen
than to anything else we've run across, and probably would not win a
slam, but much of our audience has come from the people who were
first turned on to verbal performance by attending slams.

There's nothing at all wrong with being popular or entertaining. And,
at least around here, it's doing more to help encourage other
poetries than it is hindering them.

Yeah! Wammo's dynamite (though he's looking much less like a wrestler
nowadays); he won a slam here in Dallas last week, and is heading off
to Portland with the Austin team. I've worked with him some, and he's
very clear about what he's doing and how he's doing it. One of the
best performers around. (I saw him opening for Lydia Lunch at South
By Southwest a few months back. He was captivating (while Lunch was
dull enough, going for the easy shots without much performance in it,
that we left soon into her set.))

From: Anselm Hollo

Emerging from my lair here, to salute the memory of George Starbuck, first
met in Buffalo thirty years ago, during my first summer there in the company
of G.S.,  Ann London, Robert Creeley, John Logan, John Wieners, Robert Hogg,
Basil Bunting, George Bowering, Jack Clarke, Al Glover, Duncan McNaughton...a
summer that definitely changed my life, as did George's subsequent invitation
to come and teach at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, whose director he then was.
 Cet ouvroir was a very different place during his tenure than what it had
been before, and, I believe, what it has been since.  Not only did he invite
Kathleen Fraser and her then husband Jack Marshall, he also invited Ted
Berrigan, Steve Katz, Seymour Krim, David Ray--all, at that time, regarded as
pretty 'cutting edge' makaris, somewhat threatening, even, to the post-Paul
Engle neo-Frostian/pseudo-WCWilliamsian 'Iowa' establishment.

George was a wit, an ironic master of traditional Anglo form, and a gentleman
of a wide and utterly non-provincial understanding of the art.  I believe
that he, Ted Berrigan, and your humble servant deserve credit in Poetry
Heaven for our work in that place and time (Ted was politicked out of there
after only one year, by the above mentioned establishmentarians; I outlasted
George by a couple of years, thanks to painter Hans Breder of the art
department who fixed me up with an 'interdisciplinary' gig for a couple more
years): the roll call of 'our' (and, yes, Kathleen's & Jack's & Seymour's &
Steve's) students looks pretty impressive today: Alice Notley, Robert
Grenier, Ray DiPalma, Merrill Gilfillan, Michael Lally, Darrell Gray, Barrett
Watten, Bob Perelman, Arthur Vogelsang.  (None of them, of course, quite as
famous in the Old Iowa Lineage as, say, Norman Dubie or Michael Ryan.)

So--Thank You, Captain George.

in response to the longish pro-slam post below from jzitt, when a discussion of
open mike readings (and by extension slams) came up about a year ago on the
list, there was much less acceeptance of "entertainment" forms of poetry than
there is this time around.  i like this shift, esp when narrated as below, from
someone who has given slams a chance and sees their value and also,
significantly, points out that they change over time; like any poetry, they're
not static.  interesting discussion, y'all; thanks! md

hey maria, hi!... happy to complicate things!... nothing wrong with
entertainment, hell no, but---

after sitting through most of the republican convention, and esp. elizabeth
dole's generally acclaimed oprah-"performance," i guess what i'd like to
ask is how, from a broadly cultural perspective, one might go about
aligning questions of public literacy with the recent success of oral
performance venues like slams (for that matter, i could ask a similar
question having to do with print or electronic poetry publication, or with
the production of literature generally---but the answers would no doubt be
somewhat different)...

that is, i'm asking (and mebbe i'm just being my contentious self here) how
we may gauge art-as-entertainment or art-as-performance not only in terms
of aesthetics, albeit this is valuable too, but in terms of its cultural
quotient---whether spoken word or workshop or what have you---and wrt the
macro-mainstreams of u.s. public life... which latter i understand, anyway,
as having gone much further Right politically while, for example,
performance venues would seem to have increased in popularity (which is
certainly not to suggest a causal relation...)...

i fully accept and appreciate the value of resistance in specific
communities, specific poetry publics... on the other hand, i guess i feel
as though this resistance has itself been progressively (or regressively)
displaced in much of our public domain... which has (only apparently?)
defused the political quotient of the literary, regardless how
performative... so it may be a matter of asking how something so vital in
one context can co-exist with a public (televised) 'arena' that mercilessly
utilizes the performative to its own ends...

anyway, this is an all-too-hasty post, but i wonder if there isn't some
benefit to speculating less about poetry-as-state-of-the-art and more about
poetry-as- state-of-the-union, esp. in an election year?...

As many of you already know, Small Press Traffic Literary Arts Center in
San Francisco has ceased being a bookstore and has been reborn as a
literary resource center.  In our office at New College we are creating a
non-lending library of small press books, available to everyone.  There is
a lounge area next door to our office where people can lounge and read
books.

Small Press Traffic's interns have been busily unpacking and arranging our
archive, and we have room for plenty more books.  A few local poets are
donating duplicates from their personal libraries to the archive, and some
presses are sending review copies to be placed in the archive.  We will
have some kind of opening celebration late fall/early winter.

Anyway, this is a call for donations to the Small Press Traffic Archive.
Small Press publishers/writers, please send us one or two couple copies of
your publications for our archives.  Archive lisitings will eventually be
posted at the SPT page at the Electronic Poetry Center.  We will also,
beginning with the next issue of our newsletter, list recent acquisitions
to the archive.

The next issue of the Small Press Traffic newsletter will be out in a
couple of weeks. This issue features reviews of books published by Hard
Press, O-Books, and Kelsey St.  In future issues our review section will be
opened up to everybody.  If you have a book you would like considered for
review, please send it to me.

$10 to the above address for a subscription.  The newsletter is available
in the Bay Area only to members of Small Press Traffic ($35 minimum/full,

hiya joe.  i do think that there is room for skepticism about the relationship
between the rise of the right and valuation of public poetries and other
representations of "diversity."  i think this is not the fault of the
diversifiers (though one could make a case for their complicity, but why bother)
but an instance of what walter benjamin speaks of as a proto-fascistic state in
which freedom of expression is allowed minus freedom of social and economic
opportunies, equal access to justice and resources, etc.--basically,
"aestheticizing politics" instead of the converse.  with regard to the
spectacularization of oratory that mobilizes folks, we have the examples of both
hitler and martin luther king jr. who had very diff agendas.  and again, i don't
think it's the oratory itself that does the political work.

motorcycle-jacketed, snotty, clumping (boots and dragged, slogging
stride), large, drunken man who brought a couple of tables full of
loud friends.  when he stood up to read an abominably rhymed, cliched,
'borrowed' without attribution to the point of plagarism, uh,
'offering' which, as he bragged and as was painfully apparent, was
written the night before, literally, on a cocktail napkin in a bar
while he was drunk, his friends loudly applauded and whistled.  they
were silent _during_ the performance.  this was more of a courtesy
than they offered the rest of the readers.  i read a sonnet afterwards
and he gave me a dirty look, refused to applaud (though that was much
like his response, sans dirty looks, to the rest of the readers).  at
the end of the evening, he lumbered over to me, tried in a
non-endearingly clumsy way to pick me up, then threatened a male,
black friend who had accompanied me.  my friend and i whiled away a
couple of beers later trying to parse whether the threat originated
because he was black and i was white, because i read a sonnet that i
hadn't had to 'borrow' to write, or because even though the lumberer
and his crowd sulked, i still got a reasonable amount of applause...

certainly this was the extreme end of things.  but, how to describe
this, ALL my slams were full of wierd extremes (there was the fine
writer, a woman, white, who read a complex, beautiful poem in a soft
voice and got almost no applause in the face of what was probably the
most original, strong work of the evening...  or the man, in costume,
who read badly rhymed poems to animals whilst acting the various
animals out (i am NOT making this up -- he paused for 2 minute
pantomime sessions.  this is responsible for at least six of my gray
hairs).  now, this was about 8 years ago, and things may (we can only
hope) have changed since.... and i WAS at in a phase where everything
seemed to end up in a sort of derida-ian carnival.

but, appropos "speed" and slams and performance, i've found the best reading
poems are long lists of images done in a slow voice to warm people up, then
fairly conversational works.  and the more dense the work, the more slowly
i need to read it to keep the audience from getting that glazed, suffering
look in their eyes.  i know i have the same needs as an audience...  on the
other hand, i'm not near as fond of conversational poems on the page as
i am of more dense work.

light (lite?) brigade, which is about making chocolate chip cookies; i feared
the worst, in terms of her reception, but she says she scored pretty high (tho'
the poem was longer than 3 minutes) and got nice applause,  this was in
boston/cambridge (kresge aud i think).  this was just a few months ago, so maybe
things have changed, or maybe, at an auditorium there's less potential than at a

For the third time in as many years, I had a student this summer
respond to _Spring and All_ with an off the wall anlysis of the
wheelbarrow poem that invoked the Cold War,  white armies, red armies,
(red wheelbarrow, white chickens--get it?) etc etc. All these students
had been taught this analysis in high school. Anybody else out there
ever hear this? Or have any idea where it comes from? I suspect an
issue of _The Explicator_ must be responsible and I thought perhaps
somebody might have encountered it.

Yo Filch et al--

FYI, Mouth Almighty Records is releasing a WAMMO (that's the way he spells
it) album in Oct... called "The Fat-Headed Stranger" it mixes blues, grunge,
rock and uh spoken word. Even a lil ol Laurie Anderson satire. Backchannel me
a snail and I'll ship you off a copy....

Wammo himself finished second in the individuals in last year's Nationals --
Austin looks very tough this year, w/ the WamMan as (self-annointed) Captain.

Maria, I read some of the Frith piece  in the Voice where he has (had?) a
column. The analogy many Slamsters use is of the editor who divides the
poetry mss into Yes No Maybe Never OK Possible-plus vs. the Judges at
Slams....

as for e's experiences ("but, how to describe
this, ALL my slams were full of wierd extremes ) I say amen. This is one
reason I go to Slams. To hear new unfettered is another. To be able to say to
the poet who has talentbut got a low score that you liked the poem is also
part of it. The best poet always loses is the only rule in Slam.

Slams, seems to me, function best as a way in to poetry. You hear some poems
you like, some you don't, you agree with judges, or you don't, it seems
anyone can do it, maybe you'll try, etc. One of the greatest things about
Slam is the work of the poets who've used the form and graduated, like Paul
Beatty, Willie Perdomo, Dael Orlandersmith, among others....

Some of us don't need trinkets to express the inexpressible, my dear
--what do you call yourself--Georgette?  Some of us, on a summer's
eve, have the freedom of our own thoughts and need not surrender to
idle jealousies.  Charles may do what he wishes with his heart; I
know I'll always have Peekskill, and my memories of the honeymoon
suite!  P.S. Keep your baubles--you may need to hock them for a few
maple leaves.

no direct comment on that, not having heard it myself (would be grateful to, at
least it shows an interest, i'm used to stolid silence in the classroom); but
another take on the red wheelbarrow from a friend who told me a student in one
of his classes insisted that "so much depends on" etc was about a farmer's
livelihood, and how much he depended on the wheelbarrow as part of his job.  my
friend thought this was totally off the wall, but hey, this is the great
heartland, where farm machinery really can make or break you...i also had a
student once who insisted that the elevator images in Crane's "The Bridge" were
about grain elevators, which literally surround our minneapolitan landscape
rather than NYcity-type means of transportation up and down skyscrapers.  just
goes to show, context really does shape a reading...md

maria, as in the thread earlier this year, i don't want to come out against
the artistic-poetic possibilities of slams---the unexpected, slams as a
more democratizing venue, the sorts of 'unfettered' experiences bob holman
is after...

but the trouble i have/am having/will probably continue to have with slams
(and may they continue to proliferate regardless my qualms) is the way the
venue works, the way it tends to give short-shrift, say, to the contested
basis of aesthetics... and this is sparked perhaps by the spectacle of it
all... critical reception, for me, is not an ebert-siskel
thumbs-up/down/sideways---which is more evaluation/judgment... and which
tends to promote---and here i'm being most harsh---a knee-jerk audience
response... at the same time, sure---it's not the 'diversifier's' fault, as
you suggest... or at least i'm not interested in 'blaming'... and sure, i
like to see folks get together even to gawk over wordplay, but----

i think slams tend to create an aura (i only hint mself at benjamin here)
in which, like any potentially powerful entertainment, one may be swept up,
down or aside... i am---very def. am---suggesting that the nature of the
venue itself plays to our cultural predisposition toward
entertainment/spectacle (this latter now an old argument)... not that the
structure may not be used against itself, so to say...

that many folks may (will?) exploit the slam scene, as it's currently
constructed, largely to the ends of self-validation seems to me a given,
and seems to me to further the sorts of simplistic identity formations that
have in many ways vitiated all sorts of poetic constructions---making slams
no worse, and no better, than much acclaimed poetry... believe me, i'm not
against occasionally thundering egos saturated with political righteousness
or sublime moments of resplendent logos voiced with utter and complete
sincerity... but to put the matter a bit obliquely (and based on my
experience):  when three-quarters or better of the folks at a slam begin
and end on such notes, often without the slightest hint of performance
anxiety, i find mself asking, to what do we owe such unmitigated
bravery?...

best,

Hey all--

I've taught The Red Wheelbarrow for a couple of years now, and tend to
teach it on a section on Imagism.  Before having them read the poem, I
give them Pound's definition of the Image as a framework for their
readings, along with Pound's In a Station of a Metro, some HD, some
Marianne Moore.  It usually works pretty well.  Iowa students tend to
really like this poem, though, because many of them either grew up on
farms or have relatives who live on farms, so they all have a very
immediate a personnal response to the complex of images that Wms. is using.

probably a lot of beer.
so a lot of people use slams to build up their egos.  how unlike the demure and
self-effacing academy; how unlike the demure and self-effacing AWP scene; how
unlike other performance forms, like acting, rock & other popular musics, and
"performance art," where humility and anonymity are the ruling ethos.

        Re: red wheel barrows and elevators:

        A barrow is a grave, stones marking a grave site

        A red wheel barrow:  a read/red grave

From In the American Grain, "Founding of Quebec" chapter:

        The land! Don't you feel it?  Doesn't it make you want to go and
lift dead Indians tenderly from their graves --to steal from them
--as if it must be clinging even to their corpses--some authenticity,
that which--

        Stealing and reading/writing-and graves--from The Great American Novel:

        There cannot be a novel.  There can only be pyramids, pyramids of
words, tombs . . .
        He smiled and she, from long practise, began to read to him,
porgressing rapidly until she said;  You can't fool me.

        he became very angry but understood at once that she had
penetrated his mystery, that she he was staeling in order to write words.

        I have only taught theis poem once--this was method I used as it
maeks connections among the read/red graves (read, and red as "red
Indians/"dead indians")--stealing in order to write--Williams' use of
womens voices ("out of the mouths of Polish mothers")(and where is
Flossie's voice--)--and WCW's sense that there is an interealtionship
between the landscape and the american idiom--longing for such, perhaps
to steal an authenticity from Indian graves . . .which could be used for
reading the Tenochtitlan chapter of In the American Garain for exaample,
which he said he tried to model in paragraph structure on the structure
of the masonry there--

        notice also the close placement of the words "lift" and "steal"
in the "Founding of Quebec \" quote above--lift is slang for steal--as
well as elevators--one cd think of lifts going up and down in buildings
in connection with stealing/finances/land speculations/the purchase of
manhattan--and grain elevators--a hoarding of booty etc--in that
hoarding, stock piling can be a form of stealing--driving up prices
through shortages etc.

        But this approach did open quite a series of good discussions in
class room.

        As you can think of stealing words in order to write in many
relations to sampling in music and "referencing" in music videos--which
now causing many legal problems, litigation/literature aspect of stealing
words . . .


        And--the question of stealing from the dead . . . who may not be
able to sue!

        anyway--some different approaches to directions opened by the red
wheel barrow

Yup -- at the Slam at the Generation X-Po festival here a coupla
weeks ago, the members of the Austin team won everything. I think
at this point, Wammo could do "There's Too Much Light in this Bar" in
his sleep, backwards, in Latvian, and still win.

Yeah. There's an article on judging Slams in the latest Omnivore (put
out by Su Broskowitz somewhere in Massachusetts) that shows, pretty
accurately, the way that some judges do it -- and it ain't pretty.

There's a hilarious article in the latest CyberSangha about a
(fictitious) Zen competition. The winner bellows at everyone: "I am
the most serene!" and gets high scores in levitation and
enlightenment.

Joe said......" and which it seems

That is part of how it is changing, albeit slowly, in that criticism is
becoming part of the scene.  Active critical attention is certainly
appropriate to the scene but lettuce not forget critics by and large don't
critique until something, in this case slams, is taken seriously.  Perhaps
we are going through a phase transition in which the need to critique &
understand the slam phenom becomes self evident.  Whereas before it has
been much easier to dismiss.

I wonder though if the economics of the academy will force this
reevaluation.  It seems as though from an admin point of view that having a
few classes here and there concerned with perform po & slams would
certainly be an attractive way to up enrollment ;  ) in moribound lit
departs.  Why they might even have to pull in some candidates from the
hinterlands of the system to keep up with the demand.


and..." seems to me to further the sorts of simplistic identity formations that
have in many ways vitiated all sorts of poetic constructions---making slams
no worse, and no better, than much acclaimed poetry... believe me, i'm not
against occasionally thundering egos saturated with political righteousness
or sublime moments of resplendent logos voiced with utter and complete
sincerity... but to put the matter a bit obliquely (and based on my
experience):  when three-quarters or better of the folks at a slam begin
and end on such notes, often without the slightest hint of performance
anxiety, i find mself asking, to what do we owe such unmitigated
bravery?..."

Simplistic identity formations engender simple people.  Hence the state of
the world.  Umitigated bravery is easy when your preaching to the
converted.  An audience at a slam could not be more converted.  It's easy
to read some witty verse deriding the state of society to a group of
sympathizers but take that same poem out onto the street corner with a
megaphone and see where the bravery lies.  When this starts happening, that
is when it will get interesting.

Subject:      ACLA 1997 panel

As a few of you already know, this year's convention of the American
Comparative Literature Association will be held in Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, from April 10-13.  This year there will also be a new format of
sessions, with 8-12 person "seminar" sessions in addition to the normal
3-4 person panels.  I am submitting a proposal for a larger session on
the topic "First World Poets/ Third World Cultures," which I think will
be of relevance to the conference's overall theme, "New Worlds for Old."
The panel will deal with poetry and poetics of any era, focussing on
interactions between poets of the "first world" and "third world"
cultures. Possible issues include cultural transmission of ideas and
myths, empire and (post)colonialism, translation, use of "other" cultures
to challenge or revitalize Western traditions.  Papers might also explore
contact(s) between poets and "third world" communities or subcultures
within "first world" countries.

In order to consider paper proposals for the panel, I will need paper
titles and brief descriptions by September 20.  These can be sent by
email (backchanneled to me) or by regular mail:  Professor Christopher
Beach, Department of English and Comparative Literature, University of
California-- Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717.

I hope some of you will come up with great ideas for the session!

Those of us who were looking for Humument criticism earlier (spring, I

Sackner essay, and two pieces by Daniel Traister. The (large) bibliography
unfortunately seems only to be of first publications of images from the

        This is familiar territory to many on list, but for those who
don't know it--an excellent assemblage of Phillips materials (interview,
writings by Tom Phillips, essays,reviews and bibliography) is to be found in
Open Letter Fourth Series, Numbers
1&2 Summer 1978:  Between poetry and Painting.  Other artists given similar
consideration are Joe Phillips and Ian Tyson.  The volume was edited by
Kevin Power and is Number 7 in The Margins Symposium Series edited by
Karl Young

        I'd highly recommend the collection to any one not yet familiar
with it.

        Thanks to those providing Web Site information for visual

Well, yes, Mike. Two or maybe three times in the last two decades I've had
students read it as a poem about Red Chinese economics -- which makes more
sense, maybe, in vancouver that it does in Toronna. But not much. An
ethnocentrism which gloms onto western material "progress" as the subtext of
the poem. The real difficulty is getting them to see how any coded reading
closes the poem down. But you get a hell of a lot of (useful) discussion in
class as a result.

I guess what I really object to is "judges" supposedly judging poetry as
better or worse--or even having the entire audience "vote" and thereby
judge "poetry performances" (slams)--and making the whole event
competitive.  Admittedly, this is my personal issue (at least)--I hate
the idea of competition, ranking, judging, hierarchizing, and all the
authority structures that implies--and most especially when this
oppressive crap is applied to poetry readings.
          Criticism points out all sorts of connections, and lack of
connections, (hopefully), and doesn't simple rank and judge on a
scale of one to zero (or minus one).
        I don't mind hearing or giving a forum and some time to the most
drunken lout nazi rip-off, as long as the setting is such that my
poem does not have to be compared to his.
        All the audience can appreciate/not appreciate the work (as they
do) and no ranking and judging is needed, or desired, (it seems to
me)...

as someone with such a weird ego that i can't send stuff out but need others to
(i hardly even send academic papers out now; rejection is so yucky), i can
relate to this.  i don't know if i'd ever participate in a slam unless i were
pretty well assured of the crowd as friendly etc.  i realize i've been coming at
this discussion as a critic/appreciator, rather than as a participant.  i've
been absorbing the common lore that the competitive aspect of slam is just a
pretext for getting folks involved; but of course, it gets me involved as a
spectator rather than as a participant.

by the way, is anyone interested in publishing a 25-page paper on lenny bruce's

the affirmative, if you've got a response.

The student in my class this summer told a nightmare story of having
ventured a tentative analysis of the poem only to be told by her high
school teacher that she was wrong, that the poem was really about the
cold war. According to my student, she gave up on poetry at that
point, since she felt she was too dumb to get it. Imagine her surprise
when she read _Spring and All_ and saw where the wheelbarrow actually
is parked.

The wide-spread nature of this particular "interpretation" leads me to
suspect that there's some more systematic conspiracy behind its
promulgation. I won't mention any names, but the initials "GB" came to
mind right away, not withstanding public attempts on this list by
certain poet/novelists in Vancouver to cast suspicion elsewhere.

Skeptically,

Mike

no, but lots of other entertaining shenanigans very reminiscent of the recent
culture wars and NEA/Jesse Helms stuff.  at one point the judge actually quizzes
the defense on the storyline of lysistrata.  and the prosecution pits the "long
beards at Berkeley" and the stevedores out with the boys against the regular
Americans.

Subject:      red Indian barrow

        Literal statements often conceal violent analogies.

--Robert Smithson

        In recent posts Julie Marie Schmid, George Bowering and Michael
Boughn refer to Williams' "red wheelbarrow".
        Peter Quartermain writes of "an ethnocentrism which gloms onto
western material "progress" as the subtext of the poem.  The real
difficulty is getting to see how any coded reading closes the poem down.

        The lines in the poem are:

        a red wheel
        barrow

        Barrow can also mean a grave site marked by stones.

        This grave opens up other readings in Williams' work in relation
to red/read  graves as "Red Indian" graves to be used in relation to
"western 'progress'"and "ethocentrism":

From The Great American Novel:

        If there is progress then there is a novel.

        There cannot be a novel.  There can only be pyramids, pyramidsof words,
tombs.

From I Wanted to Write a Poem:

        The Tenochtitaln cahpter (in In the American Grain) was written
in big square paragraphs like Inca masonry.

From In the American Grain, "Founding of Quebec" chapter:

        The land! Don't you feel it?  Doesn't it make you want to go out
and lift dead Indians tenderly from their graves, to steal from them--as
if it must be clinging even to their corpses--some authenticity--that which--

From The Great American Novel:

        He smiled and she, from long practise, began to read to him,
progressing rapidly until she said:  You can't fool me.
        He became very angry but understood at once that hse had
penetrated his mystery, that she saw he was stealing in order to write words.

        Concealing violent analogies in a literal statement: as "the red
wheelbarrow" or "a red wheel/barrow": coded readings or encoded readings
. . .

        open many "grave" questions:

From The Great American Novel:

        What difference is it whether I make the words or take the
words.  It makes no difference whatever.

        To steal authenticity . . . to make words . . . in relation to
"the land!"

        Benjamin's Aura . . . and sampling, referencing in videos . . .

        Nations and tribes fighting for the return of bones dug up from
graves in Sacred ground and placed in museums and laboratoires . . .

        "She saw he was stealing words in order to write" and "out of the
mouths of Polish mothers" . . .

        A red wheel/barrow as open grave for readings . . .

Walter Benjamin, "Theses on the Philosophy of History":

        There is no document of civilization that is not at the same time
a document of barbarism . . . (A historical materialist)  regards it as
his task to brush history against the grain.

        A red wheel/barrow read in the context of Williams' writing on
Indians, graves, writing and stealing may open up In the American Grain
to readings that "brush history against the grain".

        ---dave baptiste chirot

(Williams also writes of red in relation to misnamed robins in the essay
"The American Background".  Again, Williams is considering the relation
of "the land!" to the American language, the American idiom, as he does
in "The Founding of Quebec" chapter:  "Here not
there".)

Addendum to previous post: I think you have to try to find out what the
author is trying to say, because it's often very specific (and you have
to try, even if it's vague).  This is an outdated form of litcrit for
some people, I don't want to get into that... My own view is that Williams
was just writing sort of an "epiphany" - the poem is the things in it,
shining in the daylight, & that's all you need to celebrate.
   But once you get a sense (at least to your own satisfaction) of
what a poem is trying to do, it's legitimate to hear other things in it,
unintended meanings & overtones.  That's how I read the red/Red wheelbarrow
barrow "subtext".  Williams quite likely heard those overtones too -
but I don't see him making that under-meaning an integral part of the
poem.  Unless it is some kind of icon for his whole work as a poet -
a wheelbarrow is literarily a laboring tool, an earth-mover, lifting
the red (Native) earth barrow into view, full of life-rain, next to the
(very) white chickens...poetry as wheelbarrow...very well, I contradict
myself!  Would take some more Williams archaeology to decide this one.
   My point is to look for a middle ground between "No that's NOT what
the poem is about!" and "this poem means whatever I say it means".
You have to look for the author's intention (though Derrida might deride).
It's usually where the most subtle language effects are, anyway - depend upon
it. - H. Gould

Just thought I'd warn you - heard backchannel you've been targeted
by the sonnet police. You could get 14 lines to life for that.
Call Langpo Central after midnight if you need a place to lose your
authorial identity.

That is an "opening up"?
Now, what are you going to do with that red wheel.

You have a problem here because the red Insians did not have a wheel,
except for the toys made around Tenochtitlan.

But that wheel was used only for that. It was a kind of Bare O

wxh is another use of the sound "barrow".
So I figure that Williams is talking about the Aztecs. And all you have to
do is look at _In the American Grain_ to see his interest in the Aztecs.
And of course one is tempted to call his book _In the American Grave_.

"what the author is trying to say" - it bothers me too, now, but not for the
same reason.  It bothers me because it's such a tired cliche.  But to
try to answer your question...  in a poem, like other forms
of communication, but sealed in writing, the author may be trying to say
about a dozen things at the same time.  & sealing that in writing is not
so easy, may take some trying.  Especially if you're trying to say things
that are not so obvious, if you're trying to say things in a new or forceful
way. Of course, the author may try to say these difficult things in a way
which seems fluent & easy - not so easy to do!  Try & see! - Henry G

Subject:      Berkeley 1965

Does anyone know whether there are "official" records of the
proceedings of the Berkeley Poetry Conference of 1965? I've got the
published transcript of Olson's speech, several anecdotal
references from Ted Berrigan, and the usual mentions in literary
historical accounts. Could anyone direct me to more material on the
event? Perhaps there are people on the list who were there who would like
to share their experiences?

I'm interested in the tenor of the event as a whole--just how Zeitgeist-y
it actually felt. I'm
also particularly interested in the way Olson's speech was received, in
whether and how Zukofsky (in his absence) played a role, and in Ed Dorn's
talk on dead poets.

Any info would be great. Feel free to backchannel if this doesn't seem
fit for group discussion.

Wow, an explication war. I was just looking for an issue of _The
Explicator_.

Here's how WCW explains the poem in _Spring and All_:

                The fixed categories into which life is divided must
        always hold. These things are normal--essential to every activity.
        But they exist--but not as dead dissections.
                The curriculum of knowledge cannot but be divided into
        the sciences, the thousand and one groups of data, scientific,
        philosophic or whatnot--as many as there exist in
        Shakespeare--things that make him appear the university of all
        ages.
                But this is not the thing. In the galvanic category
        of--The same things exist, but in a different condition when
        energized by the imagination.

I think this is the final word on the damned poem, then--the
wheelbarrow is a symbol for Shakespeare.

Hermeneutically,
Mike

Dear Friends, Please forgive the form letter nature of this communication.
As Piya and I begin to map out the program of the Frontline Feminisms
conference, I just wanted to thank all of you for your interest and to say
that if you have not yet had a chance to send us a proposal and want to, we
would like to have something by the end of next week.  A paragraph to a
page would be fine.  You can send it by fax (909-787-6386), email, or snail
mail (Dept. of Women's Studies, UC Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521).  If we
have already discussed  submitting a proposal in early September, I have
duly noted this.  If you need more information, send a message to
charmer@wizard.ucr.edu.

At the same time, please take the opportunity to tell us whether and what
kind of financial help you might need to attend the conference.

We will make several kinds of lodging available including  hotels,
dormatory rooms, and the homes of hospitable community members.  The
airport serving Riverside most immediately is Ontario.  Further details
concerning transportation, housing, registration etc. will be forthcoming.

Everyday seems to bring exciting news about the way the conference is
shaping up.  Several publishers are interested in publishing the
proceedings, and we are exploring a recent offer to have the conference
audio-taped with radio tie-ins.

We will keep you posted, and please feel free to contact any of us at any time.

Sincerely,  Margie Waller,  Center for Women in Coalition

There is nothing in the poem, shining or otherwise.

There are no things. The things are in the place where
the words are heard as saying something
 to do with
some things.

The "intention" is unknowable; the
various effects are all you can get.
 How
 the rhetoric results in the read effects is
a matter for attention     -- even though these
effects are particular to this one piece.

 It's the only way to understand what happens to
 the reader as the reader reads.

The "intention" comes down to
 the varied possibilities opened
 by the text.
                     You might say that a certain breadth
of possibility was the "intention" since that was the
 way the writer had it put in print.

 I'd look at it as more
a question of  the use
of the poem, rather than the comm-
unication of the thought of the author
 concealed behind the poem.

Besides it's obvious as a doctor, Williams, with that red and white,
was really thinking about red and white blood corpuscles.

 Whatever, I realize now that it had to be a different Waller who taught it,

Maybe you are almost at something there; but I still cannot help but see a
patronising attitude in remarks about what the author is "trying" to say.
As if the critic or teacher knows more than the author, and the author is
putting up a good effort. There there, nice try, little fellow. I like to
see an author that really tries.

No, no, no. You will remember back before you and I were born, barbers were
also surgeons--hence the white and red barber's pole. Williams the doctor
was thinking about getting a haircut, and came upon this poem. The barber
always asked him how he wanted the sides, and you have seen pictures of
WCW. He always said, "Oh, bare," which said backward is of course "barrow."

        WCW, Spring and All:

        Either to write or comprehend poetry the words must be recognized
to be moving in a direction separate from the jostling or lack of it
which occurs within the piece.

        What direction might "a red wheel/barrow" move?

        WCW:

        As birds' wings beat the solid air without which none could fly
so words affirm reality by their flight.

        "No ideas but in things"--"to find out for oneself"--"to be
moving in a direction separate . . .from the piece"--"words affirm
reality by their flight".

        To read may be an act of the imagination that affirms the reality
of the poem.

WCW does in In the American Grain.

Dear Libbie,

I would suspect that the Bancroft Library on the UC campus would have
whatever "official" records there might be. Duncan was the poetry
consultant to the rare books collection there (which is how they got
some of those great Spicer letter/newspapers, for example). The fellow
who actually coordinated it, Richard Baker, old MBA grad out of
Harvard, went on to become Richard Baker-roshi, head of the SF Zen
Center for many years, now somewhere in the southwest I believe. I
doubt he did much in the way of archival stuff -- that's not his way.

I was 18 at the time, basically unaware of the literary politics of the
occasion (so that when Louis Simpson quit his job at UC and went public
in the press with how that event showed that there was no place for his
kind of writing in the Bay Area, it came as a shock to read this in the
Chronicle--maybe if Joyce Jenkins had been around in those days). I was
challenged by the awesome price (which was something like $40 for the
whole conference), so hung out around events more than at them. A poet
I was hanging out with, Paul X (later Xavier), had some success
seducing the best mind of a certain generation, so we got to go to
several parties that seemed to be a very fluid extension of the event
itself. It's those parties that stand out more now in my memory than
any individual event, other than sitting on the stage for Ginsberg's
reading which was packed to the rafters. I was surprised (for I was
very new to this -- it may have been the first "major" reading I'd ever
attended) that he read "new" work (to me at least) rather than the
classics of eight and nine years earlier.

But the scandal of the Olson reading or the way in which Spicer was
obviously ill at his reading (later reported in some depth in El Corno
Emplumado, an excellent little mag out of Mexico City then edited by
Margaret Randell and her husband) were lost on me. I sorta knew who
Olson was, but had never heard of Spicer. I didn't discover Zukofsky
until PBS did the TV show on him in 1966.

Had that event occurred one year later, it would have been a completely
different one for me. Such is the narrative of actual events...

Is this the standard way of reading poems now?  Seems kind of self-
limiting, despite the way it tries to make the text omni-vocal, depending
on whatever the reader brings to it (SO MUCH DEPENDS!)  But I would
think that in order to appreciate all the "effects" of a poem, you'd
want to try to hear from the author's place - from the motives &
communications & craft background from which the author is coming.
All the things that give you an approximation of intention, where
the poet is moving.  I agree with Dave Chirot that this is also
limiting, that the words take off from both writer & listener in
a new direction - but I think "where it's coming from" is also
important.  Looks like three large areas have been outlined:
the author's intentions; the direction of the poem itself; &
the varied responses it creates in the reader.

Is it patronizing to assume an effort at something difficult & extremely
hard to achieve?  I think the reverse is true.  Of course, if you put it
in the imaginary context of a critic who then sets out to "explain"
in a patronizing way what the author was trying to say, you're right.
But I think it's taken for granted an explication is kind of a prose
trot laying out in boring detail what the poem puts together in a
miraculous conjunction like an elegant theorem which leads on & on
beyond explications.  & the elegance of the theorem is precisely
in the tenuous balance the writer achieves by TRYING to say many
things at once in a flying formation.

All said, however, I repeat what I said before also: you're right,
"what the author is trying to say" is a terrible cliche which echoes
down through ages of high school english classes. - Henry Gould

Ange Mlinko's magazine Compound Eye has dedicated its most recent issue
(#10) to a long poem by Dan Bouchard, called "August." It is a very good
look at Boston, and as I read it I was reminded of the work of such poets
as Charles Reznikoff, Frank O'Hara, Robert Lowell, Beverly Dahlen, the list
could go on quite a while, but what are influences anyway? Ghosts? Do you
believe in ghosts? Like Ange, Dan pays close attention to what's going on,
to what he knows, and how to make it all go together. The poem's nine pages
(fifteen sections), this is section twelve:

        Muffled shouts of neighbors

        Boston is dank
        and dirty like a drained fish tank

        Skateboard kids learn
        their skateboard skill.

        Someday anthropologists will discover the car alarm
        and realize how ridiculous we are,
        but they will note seeing-eye dogs

Ange is moving to Providence shortly, so probably the Compound Eye address
(52 Park St, Somerville MA 02143) isn't durable. You can email me at

--just thinking about "unmitigated bravery" and "sympathizers," and also the
extent to which confrontation figures into the currency of poetry slams
--then to follow the notion of bravery (unmitigated and otherwise) amidst the
already-converted, then to the unconverted... well, we might find the
unconverted or the unsympathetic out on the street (as cf put it) but I
couldn't help thinking of the classroom as well --not that I'm at all
comfortable with the view of teaching poetry as missionary work but in my
experience the feeling's been inevitable sometimes.  While I'm all for the
possibilities of slams, think they're a blast to attend, eagerly await
evolving variations on the slam (as I've seen mentioned here) to show up in
Chicago, any recs. anyone? ...still, I've noticed the double-standard a lot
of students reveal when it comes to the reception of slam poetry and their
receptiveness in the classroom --and the poetry I'm thinking of here is not
so much the standard Norton stuff (from which slams provide a nice relief)
but language and post-language and experimental work, in short, stuff which I

interesting thots.  i used to have the same problem w/ resistance to langpo" in
the class room etc., and don't know why it's changed, maybe because i tend to
teach "women language poets" which gives a graspable ideological handle for why
language must be challenged from the ground up; or maybe it's cuz i'm teaching
more advanced undergrads for the most part.  a lot of my students just like
anything oppositional, so long as they understand the terms of the
oppositionality.  also, i teach folks like tracie morris and ntozake shange, who
are sort of "inbetween" cases, in that they definitely defamiliarize what
students have come to expect of "poetic language," and are challenging to listen
as performers, but also have some discernible oratorical and vernacular
tradition that bridge the gap between the wholly unfamiliar and the verbal
simplicity of much "people's" poetry" and middlebrow stuff like frost, rich and
sexton.  also frank o'hara.  some find his "cliquishness" to be "elitist"
(minnesotans' favorite putdown) while others find it liberating to see what
poetry can be and what constitutes legitimate material for poetic content.

during the composition of such a thing, I am not aware of my trying to say

Subject:      Scandalous Olson at Berkeley?

Dear Ron,

 the position of eye-witness is shown to be what it is by
your comment on the Berkeley Poetry Conference: dependent on the
preparedness of the eye-witness.

Wystan gave me a copy of the original printing of the Olson reading,
 one that he had found in San Francisco in the 70's. Innocently, I
 had not realised -- until it was mentioned by you -- that there
 was any scandal attached to it. Far far from the action I had
 assumed that it was understood at the time and at the place.

 It seemed to me to raise the question of what was the poem and
what was the reading, where to draw the line. Was it the whole
performance of the poet live on the platform. The kind of
 ruminating thought and the writing of poems in Olson's
practice seemed to converge there. The cries of "read the
 poem" etc from audience seemed to speak to a confusion
 about what the condition of making poetry was, extending
 as it did there to a long improvisation, which from time to
time included the occasional reading of already written and
printed products of this process.  (Criticised and revised as
 a process in the Beloit lectures.)  That was scandalous?

Although it does not coincide with practices of quertzblatz poetry of
the later 70s and 80s, which appeared to prefer constructed texts to
improvisation, does this practice of Olson's (as I understood it)
seem to be scandalous anymore?  To whom was it scandalous in 1965?
Was it scandalous that the improvisations were critical and in a
broad sense philosophical and sometimes commenting on politics and
not in verse form, therefore "not poetry"?  Would it be scandalous to
the slammers?

I think this is pretty straightforward.  Following on the heels of the
thread concerning red wheelbarrows and even the reference to the rap of
Snap! it follows that the majority of teaching when it comes to the
introduction of poetry in the United States at a young age comes through
the filter of "this is what the poet is trying to say" and "this is the
coding necessary to understand that poem".  Both of these statements set in
place the mindset and world view for both rap and slam poetry.  Rap / slam
has as one of its defining attributes an active hostility to the notion of
coding.  The defining attribute is IMHO narrative and any poem which
subverts or too easily confuses the narrative thrust is suspect and falls
beyond the pale for the genre of rap / slam.

The methodology of "this is what the poet is trying to say" and "this is
the coding necessary to understand that poem" is disempowering to the
reader and serves as the political springboard for rap / slam which has as
its concern the destruction of this disempowerment.  The case 'may' be
accurately represented that once a child has gotten to the point where they
are empowered with language and feeling 'in control' poetry is introduced
in a manner which "disempowers" them by delegating control of the coding
process to the authority figure of the teacher.

Crude rhyming and inelegant wordplay are quite often the 'language' point
used to support the 'political' point of empowerment and releasing of rage
because this complex serves as antidote to the aforementioned methodology.
The points of empowerment follow closely the narrative thrust because it is
neccessary to show that "you understand what's going on" despite assurances
from the teacher (poetry), politician (society), preacher (spirituality),
that "you don't know what's going on" unless you are given the key (i.e.
coding).  It follows as well that rhyming and alliteration, etc. are the
tools employed because it is absolutely necessary that the tools of the
oppressor - subjugation, rhyme, alliteration et al. be used to defeat those
who would disempower 'you'.

Given this reading, IMHO, it makes perfect sense why langpo is received
with hostility within the genre / world view of rap / slam.

Henry, Re  things and no things in red weel barrow poem(s) No
 contradiction, maybe a little paradox. The poem, is full and
empty, made of words and spaces, not of  things.  The "things" are what
you put into an image you make reading the poems. Even those are not
things in any very secure sense.  This is further proof  of the
difficulty of speaking adequately about representations, mediation
and/or figuration.
    One way to handle that is to have regard both for the process of
making a representation and the process of "reading" one, trying to
maintain what clarity one can all the way. This is not made easier by
using the term "things", but harder, as this exchange shows all too clearly.

Henry,  some more:  "Is this standard way of reading poems now?"
---?@#%ed  if I know. (How would I know, I don't read poems for a
living? " Que scais-je? " with a  cedilla.)

 My business with this is
the common problem in the arts,
representation". What is the common
understanding then of reading/writing,
it is not moving through text?
t is not surprising that the figure of a "writer"
 occurs to the reader
as a centre for coherence of text, but the "writer"
 is limited to being a figure appearing to the reader.
 Isn't that so? Dr Williams cannot
cure you of uncertainty as to the meaning of the text, I suppose.

But isn't it also the case that the "reader" is also a similar
"figure", not a single centered "I", rather something called into existence
by the text. Coping with the text, or not, is, in that case, a matter
of how effectively you can be the necessary kind of "reader" figure
to read that text.

This is how I figure it, but I suppose this is a complicated kind of
answer for e-mail. And subject to really too many unanswered
questions.

George, "hearing something" and "getting it down" squares with my
understanding of what goes on. I believe there is a confusion about
purposes emerging (Henry's confusion, not yours, needless to say).
There is a certain satisfaction in philosophically analytical writing
in applying rhetoric to getting an argument made effectively. Reading
that writing that does that, one asks all the time about the
implications for an argument of what is being said, the significance
and multiplicities and ambiguities of       "words"   meanign of
words used as "counters" or "terms.

 The poetries that aim to set down language (thought?) as it occurs
are not usually so concerned with words as terms in an argument.
Trying to read them as if they were, and taking the prose of analytical
argument and communication as standard and universal produces Henry's
sense that WCW in red wheel things has cunningly compressed a lot of
argumentation or argumentative thinking.

I may have missed a few posts on this, since this, Henry, but I think your
phrasing here sure opens a can of worms.

1. I'm not at all persuaded that a poem is a "form of communication," -- or
rather, I'm not at all sure what exactly "communication" might mean when it
comes to poems -- not, I'd say, the sort of instrumental language of
"Doctor, I get a pain just here when I put my left elbow in my Mouth" kind
of thing, nor even that of "The whites have slaughtered the Indians" (not
that anyone here, I know, has been suggesting this is the "theme" of that
Indian Barrow). A poem is  a machine made of words, I thought. Perhaps in
the sense of Hamlet, to Ophelia, "Yours, whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet."

2. Ditto re "sealed in writing." This suggests, does it not, some sort of
immutability to a "message" or "content" that  the poem somehow, hmmm,
"contains"? Or does "sealed" mean "hermetically" and therefore
"inaccessibly" sealed?

3. My own reading practice involves -- at least in part and so far as I am
able without being utterly pedantic about it (whatever pedantic means here
-- probably means "until I can't be bothered any more") -- an attempt to
"historicize" the text:  for instance (though this is clearly a childish and
utterly simplistic example) was "red" associated with revolution or with
communism in 1921 when WCW wrote the poem (we all know the answer to that
one, of course)? This is important to me because it's self-evident to me
that I know "more" than the poet knew -- by "more" here I mean something as
simple as "what the poet did not [and perhaps could not] know," and
sometimes we (I) need to rescue the poem from our knowledge. The corollary
is obvious: the poet knew "more" than I do..

At the same time, though, my own response when I read the poem -- especially
but not only for the first time -- may or may not have anything to do with
the actual compositional circumstance and history of the poem: the words say
what they say. The first time I read any Jabes, for instance, I had no idea
AT ALL who he was, thought he was possibly Spanish or even Biblical. And
that image of him still sticks, willynilly, when I think of him / his work.

And what then is getting "communicated"? It seems to me that when Bruce
Andrews writes, as a complete poem, "lost & found", he shows with great
exactitude how what is "communicated" depends on the context of the
hearer/reader as well as of the utterer/writer: meaning depends on context,
I think Maria Damon said on another thread not too long ago, and it sure as
sure doesn't exist "out there" somewhere, all us poor folks scrambling round
to find out what it is so we don't get left out in the cold when gift-giving
time comes round.

But of course, what I say is too simple anyway. Henry, or should I say Mike
Boughn?, you opened up an inexhaustible  can of worms.

someplace in the neighborhood of this thread belongs Kenneth Koch's story of
doing a  mini-residency somewhere, and attending a lecture, about his work,
in which the professor carefully explicated "Permanently" to his students:
the noun representing Christ, the adjective the Holy Ghost (or whatever); & etc.

others might have heard the story more recently and be able to tell it better.

There's a lot of truth to this, but it also seems one-dimensional to read
the classroom simply as a power structure and poems as power codes.
It sets up a binary "dialectic", like beats & new critics,
that makes for easy academic readings after the fact ("codes"?), with
beats & new critics completely symbiotic (where would the beats be without
their establishment foils?  where would slams be without high school
english class? etc.)  I remember nothing more boring, depressing &
disempowering than 9th grade english teach asking, "Well, what's the poet
trying to say here?"  But then again, there's always the option to
take him or her up on the call & "try" to figure it out.

This is ironic because a lot of the "coding" in traditional poetry that
is the most interesting is political coding, that "tries" to undermine
specific political oppressors & social repressions.  They who have
ears to hear, let them hear (saith the preacher).

This all makes a lot of sense to me.  I'm one on this list well-known
for re-stating new critical truisms as though deconstruction etc. never
happened.  Master-oversimplificator.  But in spite of uncertainty,
I still tend to read poems on a basic level, as a practitioner.  &
as a practitioner I'm moving in certain directions, drawing on past
methods & hangups & patterns, & adding new things, & I tend to read
other poets the same way - & try to see what they're doing.  Mandelstam
writes about future literary studies as pursuing the "impulse" behind
the text.  Maybe that's part (only part) of what he's talking about.
(It certainly isn't an autobiographical impulse he's referring to.)

The fourth eyeball helps (replaceable).  I don't see it as exactly

I agree with you.  This is what I said in a post yesterday: there's the

Libbie,

Ron was 18, I was 17 (and didn't know Ron, or anyone else; some things
don't change).  Since I had been  wrapped up in the Don Allen
anthology--to the point of having to hold it together with a rubber
band--being in rooms with these people had me completely agog.  In
retrospect I can see that it was a bit of a childhood fantasy: watching
a book come to life.  Unfortunately, because I *was* 17, half the time
I had no idea what I was seeing/hearing.  Stuff I remember vividly
(be warned that this will have the spotty quality of real memory):

Creeley and I believe Dorn in a small classroom, and Creeley commenting
on the irony and perhaps pity of holding this event at the University
of California (this in the context of the Free Speech Movement, of
course).

Sitting right behind Bobbie Creeley in that small classroom.  Why is
this as available as yesterday?  Perhaps because I was in a state of
near-religious ecstasy...I mean, the actual Bobbie of _For Love_ (okay,
you can laugh).  Beatrice.

Duncan sweeping around in his cape.  His extremely--eccentric--reading
style.  Walking from one place to another with the group, and noticing
Robin Blaser's beauty.

Ted Berrigan reading.  A revelation!  (Went home and ordered a mimeo,
I think, copy of _The Sonnets_, heartbreakingly eaten by insects on the
island of Oahu circa 1977.)

Lenore Kandel reading, I think at the same event?  In this case not so
much the poetry, but the energy, the buzz from the breaking of language
taboos.  Probably also vivid because it is a woman speaking.

The Olson reading:  mostly I can just see that commanding figure.  I
had no idea of the subtext, and remember being somewhat outraged by
the audience.  Duncan walked out (with others?).  I took notes during
all of this (and during the conference as a whole) but can only
shudder to think what sort of notes I might have taken at 17.  May be
able to find these if I undertake an archaeological dig of my
notebooks.

Watching Kenneth Anger movies.  This can't have been part of the event
proper, but I think a lot of poetry people were there.

And that's about it for the vivid stuff.  I paid $45 at an office on
Oxford St., I think, for all this--I know it was $45 because I still
have my ticket (according to the ticket, which does specify "Berkeley
Poetry Conference [Seminars] July 12-23, 1965," there was also a
$25 option).  I keep thinking that somebody might want to use this
ticket if there's ever an exhibit on the conference.  Let me know.

I'm not prepared to accept this subject line as a baseline for the
discussion of poetry. As Maria pointed out or quoted earlier (and I'm sure
I'm bending the meaning) there is an aesthetic judgment in every
judgment--and since we can read anything in terms of any category--for
instance, the picture of a self we get from Bruce Andrews, society in Susan
Howe, passion in Paul Muldoon--and I'm probably not prepared to accept
someone else's we, either--since anything can be read in terms of any
category, a reader, one has to decide whether to do the charitable thing
and decode the categories the writer is choosing to work in, on, through,
or whether to read the writer's work in contexts of one's own devising.
This latter choice I take it leads to that hallucinatory wheelbarrow. Does
it lead there necessarily? Or is there a set of critical selves one can
bounce among that will occasionally push one into the bumpers of the
writer's categories and then into the bonus targets of the world.

Which is to say, you read, you have taste, a taste anyway, and you argue

The issue is that it is there, one participates in one's own taste, even
when one rejects bland unexamined instances of other peoples' taste or
'sensibility'. So. One is open to evaluation on the terms of all categories
at all times. That is, one is available to be read by anybody always
already cough. One may wish to resist, to preserve the integrity of that
reading through closing gestures, error, erasure, hermeticism, ironic
cuteness/ugliness, but this may prove to be paranoia. What is at stake in
any reading, what power is there, why am I for one struggling so much to
achieve it/dismantle it. I suppose asking questions is the best way to
centralize power. Was Kurt Cobain a practitioner of the New Sentence? Are
you still reading. Is that a question it is important to ask? Shall we
overpraise the present and be done with it. Am I grateful for the
simultaneous expansion of vocabulary and relaxation of the sentence. Yes. I
am grateful for the opportunity to use any word I hear in any sort of
sentence I want to write. Am I even more grateful for the words I like
best, and the opportunity not to finish my sentences. Yes I am even more
grateful. Why. Because those give me more. That is, the cadence, the
development of the cadence. Grr. Does one feel the urge to be 'compulsively
readable'. Break it up. Does one feel the urge to ride a power mower. Oar
hour. Does one have to include more or less than is expected. Does one have
to include exactly as much as expected. Who is expecting? Blush. No, no
news. But what if there were. Would it be verboten, aesthetically,
intellectually? What part of the bandwidth permits that news its
nonstatistical centrality. This does seem a live issue. I am not asking.

A few thoughts on coding:

1) Is rap really that transparent?  I often find myself smiling at my
ignorance as I listen to it.  Coding doesn't strike me as uniquely a tool
of power in that sense.  Think, too, of the codedness of early Stein,
about which Catherine Stimpson has written well.

2) Probably the experience that got me into this mess was "decoding"
poems (and novels) in high school.  I remember Kubla Khan in particular:
we had a field day.  Of course, I had a good teacher, and that makes all
the difference.  But the message was unmistakeably, there's more here than
meets the eye.  He--Mr. Moceri, for the record, aka Mr. Mo,  of Parkway
North Senior High, Creve Coeur, MO--had a way of just reading the poem
aloud that nudged us to come to terms with what more might in fact be
there.

So, framing my answer in good Jeopardy fashion, isn't there a
difference between the impetus to decode (which, it seems to me, we have
to do all the time, in life and in poems) and the spirit in which we go
about our decoding (roughly, liberally or restrictively)?

By the way: went to one slam about four or five years ago and had a
wonderful time--it made more of an impression on me than most readings.
Maggie Estep won (at the Nuyorican), deservedly.  It was excellent
theatre.  I have to admit, I don't absorb poetry terribly well at
readings, but I remember an astonishing amount of poetry from that night,
including one introductory piece (out of competition) that began, roughly,
The lions at the New York Public Library roar at me  when I walk by them.
Anybody know who/what that was?  What was so striking was the way this
relatively small guy (as I remember him, at least) let loose this, well,
roar of words.  I was convinced, immediately, that these folks were
restoring something vital.

i agree; rap is often delivered at a speed and with vernacular inflections that
act as real defamiliarizations (for me anyway) of a language i usually think i
know.  and isn't "defamiliarization" an old r-formalist hobby horse
characteristic of "literary"/poetic language?  sometimes its messages appear to
be straightforward expressions of anger (fuck tha police etc) but there's much
more to it than that, lots of intertextuality (sampling) that presumes a deep
insider knowledge etc...

The poetry conference fit right in. I remember the Ginsberg reading was
packed. I mean packed. Ginsberg read this incredible poem about just being
crowned king of May in Prague by the Czech students, then getting arrested
by the Czech police, thrown onto to plane & thrown out of the country. He
was yelling & angry & tremendous. His reading was part of the
zeitgeist--here at Berkeley we students had stood up & gotten arrested. And
in Czechoslovakia the Czech students had also stood up & had to face their
police. Ginsberg's reading was a preview of coming attractions.

I also heard Lenore Kendale--she was the only woman poet I remember. I was
fascinated to hear her read in a poem about washing dishes! Terrific. I
hadn't read any woman poets before. Now here was a live woman poet!
Inspring!

I heard Olsen read--is that what you meant by Olsen's speech? I didn't know
who he was--just knew about the beats.He was a Big Man. He read & drank
from a bottle of whiskey in one of the auditoriums. It was shocking and
wonderful, as you weren't supposed to drink whiskey in a classroom. He kept
on reading & drinking. He got drunk. We in the audience loved it. A little
dean in a suit came in, to try to stop the reading. We in the audience were
against him & with the Big Drunken Poet. The little dean (I called him a
deanlet) went up the the Big Poet & tried to get him to stop. We in the
audience booed. The little dean slunk away in deafeat. We in the audience
felt:  another victory for students! Olsen kept reading and drinking. It
was a wonderful experience--oh yes, it fit right into the zeitgest.

Tony and others -- this particular strain (poetry and argument) has always
interested me.  I'm wondering to what extent a poem like WCW's (and much of
his work) can be read as argumentative without relying on the standards of
analytical argument and communication that otherwise might inform a reading.
To disagree a bit, i find that many of the poetries that "aim to set down
language (thought) as it occurs" are very much concerned with words as terms
in an argument.  But admittedly, the nature of the argument is a bit
different, skewed from the conventional sense of how argumentative rhetoric
works.  I'm thinking of the work of Lyn Hejinian and bpNichol in particular
(tho there are several other possible examples)--two strategies in writing
that i would say approach language from an argumentative angle, Hejinian's
through the logic (illogic) of association, Nichol's through paragrammatic
play--but both "following a line" to suggest a point or several points (if
not a neatly resolved conclusion).   A good reading on my part leads to a
place where i "get the argument," although i may not be able to trace its
development via conventional modes (cause/effect, etc.).  So i wonder how a
statement like "all writing is argumentative" would be met and challenged.
For me it would be helpful to expand the notion of argument to include more
than just the Aristotelian variety.

Interesting bk on this is Jonathan Kertzer, Poetic Argument
McGill-Queens U. Press, 1988.  though I think he takes narrower
position than you (values poems that make some kind of real argument).
(I could be wrong - read it a long time ago!)

also think of von Hallberg's book on Olson where he talks about 1st
part of Maximus as in form of classical oration.

I did not mean to imply that rap was transparent.  Nor is slam poetry

The coding of rap is an extremely interesting topic.  I still believe it is
distinctly different in intent than coding in langpo.

"act as real defamiliarizations (for me anyway) of a language i usually think i

yeah, that's just it---from one pov, it's ALL coded... one dominant
gradient in our public discourses asks us to construe meaning-making as a
process of en/decoding... part of this is a consequence (broadly) of
information technologies... you've all heard this before---'the information
is encoded, transmitted through a conduit, and emerges at the other end to
be decoded'... but to say this is to recognize, as well, the specifically
political dimension of communications apparatus... b/c the question, as a
few folks have suggested, becomes a matter of who possesses the
intelligence or counterintelligence cheat-sheet---who's doing the
en/decoding?...

nevertheless, this is a powerful means of manipulating demographics, of
transforming specific information into specific insider(-outsider)
knowledges...

what it's all about, in more dystopic terms, is constructing
audiences-markets predisposed to responding (or consuming) along certain
coordinates---political speeches, cereal boxes, poems, what have you... i
don't wish at all to naysay anybody's particular transgressive-resistance
hobbyhorse---but so long as you play primarily to this latter grid, you're
probably enjoying the interpretive fruits of a statistically-conceived
reality the likes of which one sees at work in every nook and cranny of a
vegas casino...

some of what comes out of such transactions *can* be of value, yes...

now, whether or how meaning is made is not necessarily the same thing as
persuasion... but if you persuade folks to make meaning in accordance with
an a=b rhetoric (-logic), it's likely their general response to the meaning
process itself can eventually be controlled... that is, you persuade folks
to accept thus & so *as* persuasion, however familiarizing or
defamiliarizing...

it seems to me that, in general, the performative these days seems to be
taken as itself (regardless *what's* said or acted or ____) a measure of
persuasive validity... again:  elizabeth dole may only have simulated a
get-down-and-dirty-with-the-people talk, but it mattered little---the
gesture itself, by stepping outside of standard performance criteria for
convention speeches, rec'd goo-goo-eyed acclaim even by more experienced
broadcast journalists...

which i trust won't be taken as an argument against persuasive poetics as
such...

Subject:      slams again; symbolic chicken in the classroom

cf writes:
Rap / slam

has as one of its defining attributes an active hostility to the notion of

coding.  The defining attribute is IMHO narrative and any poem which

subverts or too easily confuses the narrative thrust is suspect and falls

beyond the pale for the genre of rap / slam.

The methodology of "this is what the poet is trying to say" and "this is

the coding necessary to understand that poem" is disempowering to the

reader and serves as the political springboard for rap / slam which has as

its concern the destruction of this disempowerment.  The case 'may' be

accurately represented that once a child has gotten to the point where they

are empowered with language and feeling 'in control' poetry is introduced

in a manner which "disempowers" them by delegating control of the coding

process to the authority figure of the teacher.



Crude rhyming and inelegant wordplay are quite often the 'language' point

used to support the 'political' point of empowerment and releasing of rage

because this complex serves as antidote to the aforementioned methodology.

The points of empowerment follow closely the narrative thrust because it is

neccessary to show that "you understand what's going on" despite assurances

from the teacher (poetry), politician (society), preacher (spirituality),

that "you don't know what's going on" unless you are given the key (i.e.

coding).  It follows as well that rhyming and alliteration, etc. are the

tools employed because it is absolutely necessary that the tools of the

oppressor - subjugation, rhyme, alliteration et al. be used to defeat those

who would disempower 'you'.



Given this reading, IMHO, it makes perfect sense why langpo is received

with hostility within the genre / world view of rap / slam.


It does make sense.  Though it's the subversion of narrative that's the
appeal to teaching langpo et al in the first place --demanding more attention
just to elements (and I mean elements: space and punctuation and alphabet, to
name a few); introducing the concept of encountering a poem as just an
experience of reading rather than extracting "meaning". I think you can
pretty much carry over the same value to rap / slam  for usefulness in
emphasizing listening/voice over, say, speculating over what those damn
chickens symbolize, etc, --esp. when students intuit (see WCW thread) and
think they must, for the moment at least, adhere to a teacher's narrative
(just another in a world of competing narratives). I've always hoped that
showing students quote difficult poems unquote does a bit to mitigate the
presence of that narrative when they figure out for themselves why the author
is doing something that initially bothers them so much. I've seen the ones
that do --they become terrific readers/listeners of just about anything and
hence empowered; sometimes they remained bothered by the stuff, but in
getting it on their own terms, not defeated.

best, wm

This seems like a good description of what poetry is NOT about.
(I realize you're not saying it IS, Joe!)  As I
understand it, a poem is like a cognitive "solution" to
a set of images/concepts/things-that-are-important-to-the-writer - a set
which, without the poem, don't hold together, don't "make sense", are
vague & disparate & inchoate & skemanderlous.  And because that's so,
the poem contains a measure of difficulty, equal to concision.  What
was that phrase of Pound's, something like dictare = condensare (to
write is to condense?).  And the invention/discovery aspect of the poem,
it's newness, is also a discovery for the writer.  It's super-coded;
it's not a code manipulated & programmed for a particular use.
It's not power OVER; it's verbal power per se.  And verbal power
has consequences in all directions, & can't be pigeon-holed by a particular
socio-political theory. This is not to idealize or make the poem
"clean" : look at Pound's conglomerations for example.  But one
can ask whether the poetry in Pound dominated by fixed ideas &
stubborn assumptions is really new, really discovering anything.
Pound is just one example.  When a poem is ready to prove something
by rhetoric rather than discovery, we start to "see through" it,
it doesn't move much, it's dead.  It's a speech, a code. Does this
contradict what I wrote before about the poet trying to "communicate"
something?  Maybe not.  The poem is what emerged from the impulse to
communicate something; it's more than the impulse, but the impulse
can't be discounted. (The urge to kill for a cause in Pound is an
impulse; to kill for glory, for the right, for the epic.) But I think
there's a disinterestedness in real poetry; not indifference, but
a specific poetic energy that achieves something as-poem, in itself.

Briefly, sure.

Has to do with pointing towards truth, as opposed to worrying about
methodology of establishing same.  Or maybe its speaking from grounds of,

I was told personally by Ron Silliman that "Snorkling the Lotus" was about
him! Oh, I get it; you tell all your conquests that the poem was about
them. Well, some of us here in poetry-land think too much of our craft to
employ it in amatory adventures. Some of us, such as I, live a life of the
mind. What is Ron going to do when he finds out that you dalled with
Pierre, and heaven knows how many others? Ron Silliman is a sensitive man.
And he does not go around writing public poems about his affairs of the
heart.

MARK WALLACE

In Case of Damage to Life, Limb or This Elevator


Enthusiasm for secret doors
loses itself in the house
of redundant emphasis on the money
that wants to take over the day.
My best thoughts are ones
I stop myself from saying.
Who needs the state to censor me?
Across the courtyard huddles the empty
building of blatant charities
which knows what's not getting used to it.
Let's have our cake and eat our words,
inventing ghosts who hover in basements
uncovering useless crimes.
The world just isn't the mind
which keeps falling over the matter
of fact that wasn't there
when no one showed up.
Listening at night,
what do you hear beyond
the mangled psychodramas?
I never let myself think
in silence and the air-conditioning
of lives that go their own way.
Wind blows the pages apart.

Really now, Georgette--seems to me that Ron goes around doing little
else.  Reading him is an endless game of connect-the-nasty-bits ("Only a
minute after we agree that we're going to hop up, take a shower and not
make love this morning, you're on top of me, rubbing, gradually slipping
my penis in").  No, "Snorkling the Lotus" is all will-o'-the-wisp, all
gossamer and hardly bears comparison to that sort of tawdry retailing.
The affair you mention, if it happened at all, should have remained a
private matter between Ron and me (and possibly the night manager of
that place in Ossining).  Oh Charles, how could a few soft words on a
summer's eve result in such humiliations?  XXXOOO a few disconsolate
kisses in memory of my feelings.

is a real Silliman quote.  It's from _Under_, specifically the hunk
published in _B City_ #9, 1994, p. 4 (and I don't believe that Ron
has ever apologized for such passages).

hi guyzies i'm trying to theorize hannah weiner as 1) a jewish writer and 2) in
terms of trauma theory, or let me rephrase that: her texts seem to me to be
"effects" (hey that almost rhymes)  of the trauma of postmodernity.  and also of
being a jewish american girl (princess?) in the 40s and 50s --whose relatively
comfortable youth was concurrent w/ the Holocaust; this is a twist, i think, on
our earlier discussion of middleclass american women's "right" to use (the use
and/or abuse debate) the holocaust as touchstone for articulating their
experience: in this case it's not weiner but me who is trying to claim that as a
legitimate, if "silent teacher"ly subtext of her decentered, disavowed and
displaced writings-by-dictation.  whaddya think?  charles, you said something
once about a pasage in clairvoyant journal that was particularly germane to her
Jewishness; i can't recall/find what it was.  any thots, any won?

Subject:      Re: weiner again

I am sorry I don't have time tonight (first week of classes at UB and
acutely hectic for me) to respond more fully to Maria's thoughts about
Hannah Weiner, though I do try to touch on some of the same issues in the
LINEbreak interview I did with Hannah. But I think the reference Maria is
referring to is from her recent work "Paw" where she recounts that a magical
creature has followed her from Mexico to NYC and that this creature houses
itself in a small velvet-lined drawer inside her forehead. This, it seems to
me, is an image of the Tfellin* (the scripture that Orthodox Jews bind on
their forehead). Also: Hannah emphasizes, in respect to the Clairvoyant
Journal, that she see words on her forehead and the picture of her on the
cover of the book has WORD written on her forehead.  BUT, Hannah Weiner
herself makes no connection to any Jewish reference.

I think on the LINEbreak tape I pose this to Hannah and she notes that I
misremembered some of the details on "Paw" (which I heard at a reading about
two years ago but have not read). Problem is, with this speed of this
medium, to send this out now, and not in a month say, I am repeating the
same misremembered details, which, if adjusted to what is in "Pah" would, I
think, still hold. (I believe this poem is part of a ms that will be coming
out before too long. It's a marvelous --wild -- piece, kind of a cross
between Beatrice Potter and Magic Realism, but then again like neither one,
and presented by its author as actual. But I better stop before I
misremember more.)

*not sure if I spelled this right I checked my on-line dictionary here and
it suggests "Telling", the title of Laura (Riding) Jackson's book [The
Telling]. Weiner's method is also, of course, am image of a/the "telling".

The gematria I think is numerological (someone please correct me!) but
most of the Kabbalah is a study, not only of the words and letters, but
of the actual _shape_ of the letters related to the inner meanings of words.

Whoever keeps track of press coverage of the EPC Web site (I think that'd
probably be Joel Kuzsai, but what do I know) should check out p 191 of the
September issue of Wired, the one you can read standing around at news
stands right now.

Others on the list may also be interested in checking it out.  Besides the
positive verbiage on EPC there are URLs for some other poetry sites
including a cowboy poet site <http://www.westfolk.org/> & something called
Oyster Boy Review  <http://sunsite.unc.edu/ob/> which, from the look of it
(I haven't checked it out yet), is a Bukowski love feast.  You'll also find
a listing for Ocassional Screenful, an e-mail list that does nothing but
send a poem every few weeks (as opposed to Poetics-L which does everything
including sending a poem every few weeks).

Needless to say all of the graphics come from Oyster Boy, rather than the
EPC, even though the piece starts out with a slam on Quentin Tarantino.

Kabbalah comes to mind....

& a quick look at Johanna Drucker's _The Alphabetic Labyrinth_ mentions:
curses, spells defixiones, amulets, lamellae, kleromancy & alectryomancy

alectryomancy (credited to a follower of Pythagoras, Iamblichus): "divination
by means of a fowl. To use this method one scratched the letters of the
alphabet out around a circle in the sand and then sprinkled grain over them.
 The fowl was released and the pattern of its pecking was recorded. The
sequence of letters was studied for hidden meanings or messages."  --p. 68

Hi all.

Gematriya is indeed numerological-- but it *is* based on the correspondence
between the letters of the alphabet and their assigned number values.
The numbers serve to indicate equivalences (mystical and otherwise) between
words.

best,

O.

Two possible roots:
"Cheyn" means (more or less) "charm", a beauty not of aspect but of person.
Perhaps less interestingly (and probably further from the true etymology)
"Choneh" means to camp or pitch a tent; the past tense would be chana--
but the syllabic stress is different from the name-- Cha'nna the name,
chana' the verb.

Chet-nun-hay is to be gracious; it may be related to this. Chet-mem-shin
is the root of happy; hay-nun-hay is to be agreeable, pleased, pleasant;
for that matter, hay-nun-hay in the sense of hee-nay is behold or lo.

Alan - there are Arabic cognates as well.

I remember Hannah, the first time I met her, reading the word "poison" on
my forehead, and I thought at that point, it's also a weapon.

Just as depression (my own included) is a weapon.

That can't be overlooked.

Kabbalah - original meaning "to be opposite," then "to take that which is
opposite, to take over, to receive." Indication it might be related to
Akkadian words for "battle" and "middle," and Arabic "qalb" for "heart."

Check out Ernest Klein, A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the
Hebrew Language, for Readers of English, Macmillan, 1987. If you want
more traditional sources, I can find them.

I haven't seen much, in the Kabbalah writings that I've read,
referring to the meaning of the shapes of the letters. It sounds
intriguing -- can you point me toward a reference?

julie, there are two excellent books you should check out on small presses.
one is richard peabody's "Mavericks" (subtitle is something like: 7 renegade
publishers; whatever, its packed, sorry.) its very good & probably much
better than the other: "The Art of Literary Publishing" can't remember the
editor, but it strikes me as more pedantic than richard's book. both will be
interesting to you though. douglis.

I remember material in the Zohar discussing the name of God - it might
also be in tales of the Chassidim - in terms of the Hay needing support
from the yod (also means hand) for example...

-as I"ve said before, it's the act of writing or drawing
that counts.  I've seen this as a therapist and in my
own work.  The names and the theories you note are
just part of their own secret kabbalah.  Go get 'em!

        For word alchemy as performance score, see Emmett Wiiliams, The
Alphabet Symphony:

        This is a symphony in which you can spell "love" by smoking a
cigar, blowing a silent dog whistle, eating a chocolate eclair off the
floor on all fours.

        In The Alphabet Symphony, twenty-six objects are substituted for
the letters of the alphabet.  These objects, with instructions on what
the performer should do with them, are arranged on the stage in
alphabetical order.  The conductor draws a letter from a box.  He calls
the letter "E", for example, and the performer proceeds to the row of
objects, selects the "E" object, and does with it what the instruction
tells him to do.
        The objects and actions can vary from performance to performance
. . . it was the most popular of my performances in early Fluxus days . .
. (1962).
        The complete text may be found at:

        http://www.panix.com/~fluxus

                Instructions in a Symphony that varies from performance

that's what i thought, but so many folks have responded by pointing me to the
Kaballah that...uh-oh, it might be time for me to descend.  i've always been
fearful of not having the "right stuff" (by which i don't mean traditional
gender requirements, but a kind of energy for sustained longterm inquiry into
things more profound than imaginable, kinda like taking acid as a metaphysical
exercise).  not wanting to just cruise the surface, but aware of the
significance of diving deep. who'd a thot that a dinky-ass little conference
paper wd land me in the Kaballah.
thanks everyone, there's been lots of helpful response.

For maria d --

In the original edition of A BIG JEWISH BOOK I have a selectiion from Hannah's
Clairvoyant Journal -- set between an image of Wallace Berman's 1960s "Wall"
and a number of medieval Hebrew (masora) "calligrams."  The commentary on
Hannah begins: "Weiner's journals -- contemporary -- arise from an experience
of word-visualization reminiscent of those of the traditional poet-mystics:
'I see words on my forehead, in the air, on other people [etcetera].'  With
this the reader can compare, e.g., the appearance of the Hebrew letters
(above, p. 391) as "great mountains," or the oral manifestation to the
kabbalist Joseph Caro (1488-1575) of a maggid (heavenly messenger), who took
the name Mishna & a persona between male & female ..."
        It then goes on to quote Caro's description of the visitation, which
is in fact a gift of spoken rather than written words -- words that "will
speak in thy mouth & thy lips will vibrate."  The great mountains reference
from an anonymous 13th century author, describes an act of word kabbala
involving recombinations of the letters of the names of God & runs like
this:
        "During the second week the power became so strong in me that I
couldn't manage to write down all the combinations of letters which
automatically spurted out of my pen. ... When I came to the night in which
power was conferred on me, & Midnight had passed, I set out to take up the
Great Name of God, consisting of 72 Names, permuting & combining it.  But
when I had done this for a little while, the letters took on the shape of
great mountains, strong trembling seized me & I could summon no strength, my
hair stood on end, & it was as if I were not in this world.  Then something
resembling speech came to my lips & forced them to move.  I said: "This is
indeed the spirit of wisdom."

[This is probably the kind of thing Alan Sondheim had in mind in speaking
about the shapes of letters.]

I conclude the above quote with some more: "The range of approaches & names
("the whole Torah is nothing but the great name of God" -- thus J. Gikatilla)
should be clear in the images that follow.  From what is in effect a sacred
'concrete poetry.'"  And the conclusion to the commentary on Hannah: "The
lack of a similar context for Weiner's experience, etc., is a condition of
our time -- on which no further comment."

Anyway there's more in fact that could be said -- e.g. about gematria as
a field of both letters & numbers, etc. -- but it's a busy morning in San
Diego & about as far as I can go.

You might try the Blackburn archives at UC-San diego (Archive for the
New Poetry), which has all of Paul's tapes.  I'd guess the Cortland
Poetry events were a few years before Paul moved there, but there's a
chance (I'm just guessing) that he would have been there, and in that
case, there's every chance he would have come back with a recording.

The number is 619-534-2253, and the person to talk to is Brad Westbrook.

Meanwhile, Maria, I wonder about your theory. The themes in Hannah's

them would show late sixties tv and political issues, the fast,
lsd, family, friends, and isolation. Why not take her at her word?

The interest for me in Hannah's writing has always been her ability to
weave through inside and out without the usual membranes and transitions.
For Hannah much of what we call art comes quite easily to her once she
has put herself in a particular position, which I don't need to characterize.

Also see Maria Damon's essay in the new issue of <<Chain>>: Hannah makes
a pure play at consciousness by mixing genres. Sometimes she succeeds and
the reader is pleased.

George Bowering is right, we do have a good deal of information here
about both the Vancouver (1963) and Berkeley (1965) poetry conferences,
including tape recordings of the roundtable discussions and readings in
Vancouver and of the lectures and readings in Berkeley. The Berkeley
recordings are copies of those held in the library at UC Berkeley; the
Vancouver recordings are unique. And no, unfortunately we cannot make
copies of these recordings available to interested users without the
permission in writing of the participants/readers or their estates. If
you want to hear them, come to Vancouver!

Ralph Maud has been publishing a lot of useful material about the
Berkeley poetry conference, particularly about Charles Olson's
reading/talk. Several years ago, Ralph "published" for his own classes'
use a new, corrected transcription of Olson's talk at Berkeley which is
much more accurate and complete than Zoe Brown's _Charles Olson Reading
at Berkeley_, published in 1966 by Coyote. Ralph Maud's
transcription was eventually included in _Muthologos: the Collected
Lectures and Interviews of Charles Olson_, The Four Seasons Foundation, 1978.

Recently Ralph has been publishing material related to Olson's appearance
in Berkeley (as a kind of rebuttal to Tom Clark's account in his bio of
Olson), in _The Minutes of the Charles Olson Society_. I don't have the
exact issues at hand, but you can write to Ralph (snail mail only) at
1104 Maple Street, Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6J 3R6 with specific queries.
If you want issues or a subscription to _The Minutes of the Charles Olson
Society_, write to the Charles Olson Society at the same address. Single
issues are $2.50 a copy, a subscription to the current series (series 2)
is $25. Also, a transcription of the "Angel, Muse, Duende" discussion
featuring Olson, Ginsberg and Duncan, Vancouver, 1963, is published in
_Sulfur_ 33. There's also a memoir (from Duncan McNaughton, I think) of
Olson's talk at Cortland in one of the _Minutes of the Charles Olson
Society_.

If you have questions about materials held here in Special Collections,
Simon Fraser University, you can contact me backchannel at cwatts@sfu.ca.
A caution, tho: I'll be away from this screen and email address for the
next two weeks.

As a kind of perspective on the ever-mounting heap of compost in that
red wheelbarrow, look again at what Melville said about doubloons and

i'm not talking about thematics so much as effect; her writing as an effect of
post-holocaust (Jewish) subjectivity.  something like that.  not trying to
ferret out any subtext.  still, thanks for the list of identifiable themes.

Magic, alchemy and Kabbalism *are* based on exact formulas
of words and numbers or, more specifically, perfectly realized
paradoxes and complexities coded in letters and numbers. Blavatsky
once said, "God is math," (can't give you title or page number: I
find her prose insufferable), and the statement hardly originated
with her. *The Book of Numbers*, available in certain magic-related
book stores, even gives tables for the translation of words into
numbers. There is also ancient trick that is used to reduce the
the entire text of the bible (in the original Sanskrit) into
a sequence of permutations on a single formula.

My research had to do with the Sephira, Adam Kadmon, and Qliphoth,
but perhaps a few of my books will be useful to you.

Sources:

_The Saragossa Manuscript_ (both the film and the novel are brilliant),
 Count Jan Potocki,
_On the Kabalah and Its Symbolism_, Gershom Scholem
_The Book of Numbers_ (?)
_The Golem_, Gustav Meyrinck
_The Hidden Chakrahs_ (?)
_The Book of Imaginary Beings_ Borges, of course)
_Dictionary of the Kabalah
_The Astral World_, Panchadasi

Books with question marks were read or copied at the library.
This was a novella ("Val Demar's Pear," to be published by
Permeable Press in November) rather than a paper, so I didn't
keep meticulous footnotes.

I'm doing three albums and finalizing two books right now,
so if you don't see me here, it's because I don't even have

then went back into preproduction.

Someone was listening: This was part of the explanation as
given to me by a Blavatsky disciple. She (the disciple) maintained
that the Hebrew text of the bible came from a Sanskrit text, which
was said to be the origin of the permutated sequence she showed me.
Some people who study the occult, a few of whom I've met, maintain that
(and please don't kill the messenger) Kabbalism is a variant of Eastern
mysticism. No authoritative text that I've read verifies this--but
I have seen the bible-code idea referred to in _On the Kaballah and
Its Symbolism_, by Gershom Scholem.

But really, I'm not interested in getting into a discussion for the next
month or so. I haven't time. I was just trying to be helpful.

Subject:      Robert Sward etc missed by UTOPIAN FORMALIST round-ups

Does anybody on the list have any interest in
Robert Sward? Born in the USA, lived and wrote
(don't know if he@s still alive) in Canada,
selected poems 1957-1991, to give idea of
times he was writing, now out of print tho
full text available from a website. I've always
been privately very interested
in his work, came across it by luck when the
reference book, Contemporary Poets, fell open on
his entry when I picked it up idly once. He
rarely got into or gets into Books of Canadian
Verse etc anthologies, as USA born I suppose;
I got interested in him while living in New
Zealand, when I was "coincidentally" looking at
the issue of: Where Do You Get Noticed If You're
Not Part of a Movement (LangPo, New Formalism etc),
Not the big Mainstream Name, and, above all in New
Zealand, if You're Not Your Country's Nationality.

Have more perhaps heard of Daphne Marlatt? Far and
away my favourite Canadian writer, got into no
Canadian anthologies; as she was born outside
Canada; and I've often wondered if she only started
to get in because her work in the eighties
started to feel representative of a "minority
group", as a gay writer, as a feminist writer,
not just because she's a really good writer.

Anyone like Alan Riach? A Scot living in New
Zealand, also rarely gets put in Scottish
roundups or New Zealand roundups, but I think
his work is fabulous.

Shouldn't there be an anthology of the people
who don't usually get into anthologies?
The Poetry for the Millenium book just missed
all these emigres I'm mentioning -or others, like
David Miller, an Australian living in England.
And isn't it the case that ex-Brits Steve MacCaffery
and David Bromige are harder to put into
LangPo anthologies? Is it because those anthologies
are really American LangPo Anthologies, in
order to create a pure essence of LangPo utopia,
connected to the long tradition of Americans-
writing-up-their-enthusiasms-as-UTOPIAN-FORMALISM
 --------  rather than experimental-practice-
most-successful-and-appreciated-in-American-
experimentalism-consuming-practices (of which
there are nearly none in Britain and New
Zealand, in my experience, where it's still
poets in-joking to other poets, to the frustration
of a lot of great UK and NZ experimentalists!,
rather than artistic stimulation of consciousness
enjoyed by an active audience of other artists
and thinkers) ----------- rather than *actually*
look at how different
poets in english-speaking cultures with
different speech-writing relations
have foregrounded their relations
and the role of language with them?

Would anyone on the list nominate their
inclusions for such a book, or feelings
on this subject?


Best

        I once read that "Hannah" is an acronym for the three traditional
tasks of Orthodox Jewish women:  lighting Shabbas candles for the Sabbath;
going to mikva or the ritual baths in order to keep the laws of ritual
purity; and making hallah or white bread. Sorry, but I don't remember the
citation.
        I was named after my grandmother whose original name was Hannah.
After she moved to this country, she anglicized it to "Anne." I used the
above information in a poem I wrote about my name once called "The Songs of
Two sisters, Hannah and Galia." I also was named after my great-aunt whose
name was originally Galia & that got anglicized to "Julia."

NCADP CASE BRIEF:

Azi Kambule:  A South African 10th Grader Facing the Death Penalty in
Mississippi

Azi's Background:

        Azikiwe Kambule was born and raised in the black township of Soweto,
directly outside of Johannesburg in South Africa.  When Azi was 10-years-old,
his parents moved  to Spruitview, where he attended the Ridge School.
 Initially, school officials were concerned with Azi's admittance because he,
like many children in Soweto, had missed many days of formal instruction on
account of school boycotts in protest of Apartheid.  These concerns were
quickly alleviated.  Azi not only performed NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE--
well in his classes, but found the time to participate actively in sports and
sing in the school choir.  After matriculating at the Ridge School, Azi
attended Parktown Boys and was an exceptional student there as well.

        In January of 1994, when he was 15-years-old, Azi moved with his parents to
Jackson, Mississippi.  They came to the United States because Azi's mother,
Busisiwe, hacholarship to obtain a Bachelor's degree at Jackson State
University in Psychology.  Azi's father, Michael, joined the family a year
later.  Unable to find employment before his visitor's visa expired, Mike
returned to South Africa a year later determined to find a job that would
enable him to hire proper counsel for his son.

        Although Azi had done well in the rigorous educational program at the Ridge
School and Parktown Boys, the school authorities in Mississippi nevertheless
required him to be held back.  Azi was placed in 8th grade at the Chastain
Middle School in NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP
CASE--
Jackson.  Far from being educationally deficient, Azi was accepted into the
honors French class.

        In 1995, Azi began 9th grade at Jackson's Murrah High School.  He performed
well in his classes during his freshman year and enjoyed singing in the
school choir.  While Azi had no difficulty adjusting academically, there were
social problems.  Because of his foreign accent and mannerisms, his peers
would make fun of him.  These social pressures mounted by the time Azi
reached the 10th grade.  Wanting to be accepted, Azi befriended a group of
older youth who spent little time in class but  NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE--
were very street-wise.  When his grades began to fall, Azi's parents decided
to scrape together the funds to send him to Piney Woods, a well-respected
boarding school for black youth outside of Jackson.  Azi was set to begin at
this new school when tragedy struck.

Events Leading to Azi's Arrest:

        On January 25, 1996, Azi was riding in a car driven by Santonio Berry, a man
in his early twenties with a history of criminal behavior.

        According to Azi's statement to the police, Berry saw Pam McGill drive by in
a red sports car and stated that he wanted the vehicle.  Berry drove behind
Ms. McGill, and when she pulled into her apartment building's parking lot, he
got our of his car with a gun.  Berry forced Ms. McGill to move into the
passenger seat of her vehicle and told  NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
Azi to get in the back.  Berry then drove from Jackson into neighboring
Madison County.  He stopped the car, instructed Ms. McGill to come with him
and told Azi to stay in the car.  Berry took Ms. McGill deep in to the woods.
 Azi could not see or hear them.  He also could not leave because he did not
know how to drive the car.  Eventually, Berry returned saying that he had
shot Ms. McGill.

        Azi was arrested approximately one week later when an informant notified
police that Berry had been trying to sell Ms. McGill's car.  From the moment
of his arrest, Azi was cooperative.  He took the police out several times to
where he thought Berry had stopped McGill's car.    Azi -- a child from a
foreign county with no drivers license, no car, and no knowledge of the area
beyond Jackson -- was unable to pinpoint  NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
the location.  Eventually, some two months later, Berry took the police to
the crime scene.

        It was only then that authorities were able to verify that Ms. McGill had
been killed.  Azi was then charged as an accomplice to capital murder.  This
despite the fact that he had no criminal history; was not at the crime scene;
and had cooperated fully with the authorities.

Madison County and The Impossibility of a Fair Trial:

        The Hinds County prosecutor, Ed Peters, purposely moved Azi's trial to
Madison County to increase the chance of a death sentence.  As reported in
the local  NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
paper, Peters stated that he was moving the trial because the "jurors in
[predominantly black] Hinds County have a reputation for refusing to vote for
the death penalty."

        Madison County has become a refuge community for white police and civil
servants seeking to create a racially exclusive environment.  Middle-class
families in Madison tend to live in private communities where entry is
limited and private security companies often share the beat with local
police.  In the towns where there is some Black presence-- such as Canton,
the county seat -- public schools are almost devoid of white pupils.  White
children in these areas are routinely sent to low-cost private  NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
Christian academies to thwart efforts at school desegregation.

        Nor surprisingly, Madison County is the setting for John Grisham's A Time To
Kill.  Like neighboring Simpson County -- made famous in the late 1980s and
early 1990s by the frequency with which young black inmates were found
hanging by their belts and shoelaces -- law enforcement in Madison County has
historically been racially biased.

         In 1995, for example, amid wide-spread accusations of voter fraud and
intimidation, federal agents had to be brought in to relieve the Sheriff's
department of their election monitoring duties.  The Black candidate for
mayor of Canton had been expected to win and become the first African
American to hold the post since Reconstruction.  Under federal supervision, a
new election was held.  Shortly thereafter, Canton inaugurated its first
Black mayor in over a century.


        Earlier, in 1971, the Mississippi Supreme Court documented clear instances
 NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
in which Madison County officials had systematically excluded Blacks from
jury rolls -- decades after the United States Supreme Court declared the
practice unconstitutional.  Civil rights groups and defense attorneys say
that prosecutors in counties like Madison still routinely remove Blacks from
juries in capital trials.

The Criminal Justice System in Mississippi:

        Why is Azi-- a child with no criminal record (or history of violence), an
honor student and someone who cooperated fully with the police-- being tried
for capital murder?  The answer lies in the political rewards of seeking the
death penalty.

        It is not uncommon for prosecutors to use high profile cases to propel
 NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
themselves into higher office.  Madison County District Attorney John
Kitchens sees his political future as being intimately linked with his
ability to get harsh sentences in well publicized cases.  This view pervades
Mississippi politics.

        Mississippi Governor has stated unequivocally that he intends to make
Mississippi "the capital of capital punishment."  For Fordice, the future of
law enforcement and social control lies rooted in the past.  Fordice has
removed radios and televisions from prisons and reintroduced "zebra suits" as
inmate uniforms.  He also supported  legislation that would have required
violent criminals to receive six months of mandatory flogging upon entry into
the state penitentiary.  After Fordice's changes were  NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
implemented, the state penitentiary system experienced its biggest inmate
riots in years.

        Seeking the death penalty against Black youth under circumstances like Azi's
which do not warrant such extreme punishment is not rare in Mississippi.  In
the late 1980s a Black  teenage mother, Sabrina Butler, was sentenced to
death for allegedly bludgeoning her baby.  Sabrina's claim that she had given
failed CPR to her baby was not only ignored, but used to  argue that she had
no shame.  Only when private attorneys and medical experts intervened was it
determined that Sabrina was telling the truth.  After spending  years
fighting to clear her name and facing execution, Sabrina  NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
was found innocent and released.  She left Mississippi's death row this year.

Children on Death Row in the U.S.: A Human Rights Violation and Racially
Biased:

        The situation in which Azi finds himself speaks volumes about the use of the
death penalty against children.  During this decade, only five nations in the
world are known to have executed persons for crimes they committed when under
18-years-old.  Those countries  are Iran, Pakistan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia . . .
and the United States.  Of these five, America  has executed the most.  A
condemned child in the United States also tends to be of darker hue -- 66% of
those persons sentenced to death as children have been from racial
minorities.  In this century, 75% of all persons sentenced to death as
children have been African American.  Of the nine girls sentenced to death
 NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
in the history of the United States, eight were African American and one was
Native American.  Given these racially biased statistics, it is not
surprising that Azi has been chosen for the death penalty.

        And nowhere is the international rule of law more clear than the
prohibition on the use of the death penalty against children.  Nearly every
major human rights treaty in the world expressly forbids sentencing children
to death.  Significantly, the United Nations Covenant on Rights of the Child,
which the US has signed, clearly states: "Neither capital punishment nor life
imprisonment without possibility of parole shall be imposed for offenses
committed by persons below eighteen years of age"  If the Madison County
prosecutor is successful in his attempt to convict Azi as an  NCADP CASE
BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
accomplice to capital murder, either of the possible sentences will violate
international human rights standards.

Denied Bail, Azi Tries to Better Himself and Avoid Danger:

        Although Azi had no history of violence or arrest, he was denied bail.  He
is currently being housed in the Madison County Jail.  Since incarceration,
Azi has continued his studies, having passed with high marks the initial
tests for a general equivalency high school diploma.  Azi has also received a
letter of commendation from a correspondence Bible school.  While trying to
make the best of his terrible situation, Azi is also in great danger.  As
noted earlier, the Mississippi jail system has a history of Black teens being
found dead in their cells.  The occurrence has been so prevalent that  NCADP
CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
the United States Department of Justice conducted a full-scale investigation
just a few years ago.

        Azi is in particular danger because he has been assigned to share a cell
with a person who has already been convicted of a crime.  It is against the
law to keep pre-trial detainees like Azi in the same cell with persons who
have already been found guilty.  Azi's cellmate continuously harasses Azi and
threatens to do bodily harm to him.  Azi has also been denied access to a
spiritual adviser.  His minister was suddenly denied access to visit with
Azi; this is the first time in all his years of visiting persons in jail has
the minister ever been stopped from going inside.  Additionally, Azi has been
 NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE BRIEF--NCADP CASE-
denied proper access to a telephone.  The phone has been broken for several
weeks, making it impossible for him to call his mother.

4 THINGS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO HELP SAVE AZI:

1) FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS AND PRESS CONTACTS

2) WRITE THE D.A.:
---Azi is a South African child who has no history of violence or prior
run-ins with the law;  was so far away from the murder that he did not even
hear the gun shots;  and has fully cooperated with the police.
        There is no reason why DA Kitchens should be seeking to kill him or put him
behind bars for the rest of his life!

Subject:      Gematria

"a system of magic or divination based on words or letters,"


The term you are looking for, Maria, is Gematria. Doesn't Jerry
Rothenberg have a large book based on Gematria?

It's not really a matter of divination or magic, by the way, as
Kabbalah is also not really a matter of "the occult" (too much TV being
watched by someone?) as someone referred to it.

Gematria is a mystical practice of the determination of meaning and the
creation of meaning.

The word Kabbalah means, essentially, "tradition"

Scholem has an excellent introduction, smply called "Kabbalah", which
is a compilation of his articles on K-related topics for a Jewish
encyclopedia. It includes an essay on Gematria. His book "On the
Kabbalah and its Symbolism," referred to elsewhere in this thread is
one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read.  For those looking
for a long summer read (this is a little late of course), Scholem's
_Sabbatai Sevi, The False Messiah_ will help one think for a decade or
so. I could go on, but the simple way to put it is that anything by him
is worth reading.

Gwyn--

Embarrassed or not, I'm glad to hear that APR is interested.  I just
sent Tom a letter of gratitude for PROSPECT OF RELEASE (just released
from Chax).  Tom's book, which I had read in manuscript a few years
ago, is extraordinary.  Charles A did a beautiful design job, and the
cover design too is wonderful.

From my perspective, Tom's book does so many things that hostile
critics of "experimental" poetries say can't be found in such
poetries.  First, is the emotional intensity (which Ron Silliman
claims on the book jacket of PROSPECT, and which Ron already e-mailed
to Poetics).  In my opinion, Ron's claims ("these are the most
intensely felt poems I have ever read") are not hyperbolic.  Second,
Tom's work is attached to a significant, recognizable, and personal
event:  the death of his father.  Third, he risks moments of
didacticism and directness of statement.  Fourth, there is a
substantial and serious engagement with issues that might be called
religious (Jewish), metaphysical, and spiritual.

I do not know Celan's poetry very well, so I suspect that I miss
certain resonances in Tom's book.  Tom's series of fifty sonnets
strike me as most like Rilke's _Sonnets to Orpheus_--a similarly
grave engagement with death.  As someone whose own father died this
past winter, I found myself moved by Tom's book into reflection and
into new writing.  I hope that others on the List might take a look
at Tom's book, which ends:

One whom I thought abandoned me returned.

Another I asked to stay must leave.
From you I learn better and now know why
each mind must bend, but only to its task,
soul dancing at the prospect of release.

Actually, no one said that Kaballah was a "matter of the occult."
This is what I said:

Thus, what was referred to was an interpretation of Kabbalism, not
Kabalism itself.

BTW: Since the Kaballah itself was not referred to as "the occult," and since
I gave other sources for my information, it is misleading to refer to
my research as "too much TV-watching." Moreover, your characterization
of occult practitioners--people who study Blavatsky, Crowley, etc--as TV
phantoms might just as easily be dismissed as the result of "too much
TV-watching"--if I were inclined to make ad hominem accusations.

Much so-called white magic is based on eclectic interpretations of
Kabbalism. Various texts,some of which I've cited here, involve such
interpretations,
(see Blavatsky's _Treatise on White Magic_, if you can stand it--I can't),
as do taped lectures from the Theosophical Society's Lodge, for example.
I have known people who practiced magic since I was twelve (Novelist John
Shirley being the first). Is it fair to presume that the ideas you question
come from television rather than from familiarity with religious sects
and practitioners whose principles you find dubious?

Listening to the OTO (and other popular magic sects) interpret Kabbalism
is a bit like enduring a heavy metal version of Vivaldi. Still, certain
popular magic practices are relevant to this conversation, which was
originally about magic rather than Hebrew mysticism a la carte.

Look at the way in which the Sephira have been interpreted in magical
practice: This has more to do with an occult interpretation of Kabbalah
than with Kabbalism itself.

Obviously, if one wishes to study Kabbalism, it is wisest to go to
the source--which is why I cited Schocken's _On The Kabbalah and Its
Symbolism_ long before anyone else mentioned the name. But the Sanskrit
bible idea has nothing to with early Jewish mysticism: that came
into fashion far later (post-Golden Dawn?) with a different set
of practitioners. It was the Sanskrit idea that I referred to in
the context of occult interpretation.

There is no reason for you to have to agree with any occult interptretation
of Kabbalism: I don't, hence my earlier comment on not "killing the messenger."
But neither should you deny the existence of such unorthodox variants.
OTO ceremonies sometimes take place in a building visible from my
roommate's window. Neo-medieval, neo-mystical, neo-gnostic magicians,
all of whom make use of concepts taken from Kabbalah, exist outside my
very door and not merely on TV.

However, thanks for the term *gematria.*

The notion that Daphne did not get into anthologies (she did, though)
because she was born outside of Canada is not tenable. If it took a while
for her to get into anthologies it was largely because she was (a) from the
west coast, and (b) she was identified as part of an avant-garde
movement--while most of the anthologies were made by squares from back
east. She certainly never had any problem getting into my anthologies.


If you want to see a case of someone who does not get into anthologies
enough, have a look at Robin Blaser, who does not get into those recent US
anthologies of contemporary poetry (maybe because he is a canadian), and is
not gathered by the squares back east, (perhaps because he was an
American), and does not get into regular anthologies because he is
perceived to be difficult.

Being perceived to be difficult is the main reason that people do not get
into anthologies (other than second-ratedness). Do you remember who were
the first Allen Anthology poets to get into Nortons and other such
anthologies? Ferlinghetti, Snyder and Levertov. They have never been
thought difficult.

That was YOU? As Pierre is a lousy photographer, but a great poet, it was
hard to tell who the partly-clad person was. I thought it looked a little
like David Bromige, but the tan wasnt deep enough.

I certainly hope Pierre finished duplicating the pictures so we can
clean up in New Hampshire.  Btw that WAS Bromige in the corner, but
he seemed more interested in his baseball card collection (despite
all the brave talk about "desire").  P.S. Pierre, when do we get
paid for the shoot?

If Bromige's other flank had been showing, he would have been recognized
by the tattoo on his left, well, anyway, of Venus surrounded by cherubs
and scalapinos. However, this body art is very similar to one Mark
Wallace has, of Venus surrounded by veal scaloppini, so I understand why
there might have been confusion.

Yes, sorry for reading too quickly and conflating phrases and sentences
to saddle you, Rob, with a description of Kabbalah as relating to "the
occult," although perhaps I was also being a bit of a snob too, as in
fact there *are* aspects of "occultism" and "popular religion" in the
long Kabbalist tradition.

And deep thanks to Gwyn and Hank. I remember David Bromige once saying
"you get your readers one by one" or as Bob Dylan puts it in "Every
Grain of Sand" "Sometimes I turn, there's someone there / other times
it's only me."

Best to all.

the center of my palm
our sisters already dance
on the sidewalk nine

Sister I will hold you
the air will lick our thighs
grab my hand
together now fly
the sky is an unlocked door
and the machines are burning

The book Un homme grand : Jack Kerouac a la confluence des cultures= Jack
Kerouac at the crossroads of many cultures -- is available at the
University of Buffalo - we have 2 copies -- if you like (since I spend
most of my daylight hours working for
the Libraries) I can put you in touch with our Inter Library Loan Program
/  or put you in touch with the Poetry Collection. Email me backchannel.

Also, does anyone have an email address for John (J. W.) Curry in Toronto?

D.A. David Jaffe.  Judge Pickholtz is scheduled to hear the trial.
Lederman is represented by attorney and one-time prosecutor,
Marc Agnifilo (212) 768-7833. The defense has six
eyewitnesses to the illegal arrest prepared to testify.

Since 1993 the City has handcuffed and arrested more than
350 artists for displaying or selling their paintings on N.Y.C.
streets. While it has avoided prosecuting any artist's case, the
City continues to sell thousands of works of fine art it has
illegally confiscated at its monthly forfeiture auction at One
Police Plaza. D.A.'s and judges have begun publicly expressing
disapproval of the policy.

Lederman is charged with Unlicensed General Vending and two
additional charges of Disorderly Conduct. Each charge carries a
possible three month sentence. This is an unusual case in that
the Disorderly Conduct charges as described by D.A. Jaffe at a
preliminary hearing involve nothing more than the defendant
handing out literature, holding up a protest sign that read,
"Stop Arresting Artists", photographing the police confiscating
another artists' work and handing out eight protest signs to
other artists present. These activities, as well as displaying art,
are fully protected by the First Amendment. Lederman has been
arrested twice before for distributing literature exposing the
City's artist arrest policy and numerous times while displaying
his art.

At a preliminary hearing held on 6/27 prosecuting D.A. David
Jaffe told the presiding judge, "Robert Lederman has been
arrested 13 times. If we don't stop him this will only continue.
Before being arrested he handed out protest signs to the other
artists and they marched up and down. He's even displaying
photos of artists being arrested alongside his paintings."

At that hearing the judge appeared predisposed to find
Lederman guilty regardless of the facts in the case. Lederman's
attorney was told he couldn't talk about the First Amendment.
The judge and D.A. didn't want the defense to enter
photographs taken at the arrest scene, which contradict the
police report, as evidence. The judge also denied the defense
the right to subpoena witnesses to testify on N.Y.C.'s vending
ordinance or to enter relevant testimony by City officials from
the ongoing street artist Federal suit, including the Corporation
Counsel's admission that artists, "...cannot obtain a Vending
License". [Lederman v. City of New York 94 civ. 7216 (MGC)].
The Federal case is presently before the 2nd Circuit Federal
Appeals Court with a decision expected at any time. Numerous
museums, arts and legal rights groups, including the ACLU, The
Whitney and MOMA have joined the suit in support of the artist-
plaintiffs.

Lederman is president of A.R.T.I.S.T. an advocacy group of over
200 New York street artists. He has been an outspoken critic
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's quality of life arrest policies and of
City Council Member Kathryn Freed. Freed is known to be a
motivating force behind the artist arrests and, according to the
N.Y. Times, is in Federal Court "..seeking to overturn
Constitutional protection for visual art".  Observers believe this
Criminal Court trial is an attempt to intimidate artist activists.

Recently, Lederman and other A.R.T.I.S.T. members distributed
a controversial leaflet at Criminal Court ("Why Plead Guilty?")
advising so-called "quality of life" defendants to not plead
guilty or accept plea bargaining arrangements and to demand
a trial. Members of the D.A.'s office, defense lawyers and
judges agreed with the leaflet, causing the Giuliani
administration considerable embarrassment. A number of
reporters claim they've been pressured by City officials and by
the NYPD not to continue covering the street artist issue.
