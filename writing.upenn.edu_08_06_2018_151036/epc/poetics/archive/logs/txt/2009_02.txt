George,

In what way is the French Academy either political or patriotic? I would
have thought to call it prescriptivist, having watched their "ordinateur"
vs. "computer" shenanigans over the years.

This novel isn't suitable for you. The story is romantic and terrifying. Too

THis is one of those cases where it is difficult to distinguish Right from Left. The Left is big on micromanaging everyone's lives, the right tends toward conservatism and "preservation." In truth, the Language council is probably a perfect storm of Left and Right.

This is where Leftist micromanagement of all the aspects of one's life will
get you. You can't stagnate the language like that and expect literature to
thrive.

anyone have any thoughts on Updike?
most of the marquee/mainstream writers are gone.

Harold Bloom, on Updike, wrote: a minor noveliest with a major style.

David Foster Wallace wondered if he had any unpublished thoughts.

My take:

He'll probably be remembered mostly for the Rabbit novels, a handful of stories, and possibly his light verse. Obviously a gifted, major talent. But he lacked an edge, a sense of the tragic. Often more style than vision. But the Rabbit novels ... exceptional.

Washington Post's Book World Goes Out of Print as a Separate Section







By MOTOKO RICH



The
Washington Post has decided to shutter the print version of its Sunday
stand-alone book review section and shift reviews to space inside two
other sections of the paper.

We note that DNA very successfully codifies and stores all the information
required to copy/clone a living being. That's outlandishly remarkable.
That's outstanding information architecture, to put it mildly.

Moreover, the format of your DNA is the same as mine. They can be compared
to see if we are the same person, or the same sex, or both/neither have blue
eyes and so on. That information is in the same place in your DNA and my
DNA. Same format, but slightly different information for you and me.

I don't understand why you say we should not call such highly ordered,
consistent-across-beings, readable/writable information 'code' or 'coded'.
The body itself must be able to read this information to reproduce cells. We
have the same reading devices. Just different stored info that is read.

If information is stored in such a way that different beings read the same
information in the same way, interpret it in the same way, then the
information is surely coded in a way that is reasonably described as code.
We all enjoy the same mechanisms for reading and writing DNA. They may
differ slightly in the way that dialects differ, perhaps, but human beings
are remarkably similar in their overall form. As are creatures of any
similar kind. The form in which their physical form is coded, in DNA, has to
be consistently readable and consistently interpretable or the reproductive
process would go off the rails very quickly and produce monsters or dead
things. And of course it does sometimes, but not so often, thankfully.

Now, it may be that physical attributes are not so easily translatable into
sequences of DNA. Because we grow. We aren't simply copies of our DNA but we
grow over time and our attributes develop and change (though apparently our
DNA changes hardly at all). But some attributes we retain from the cradle to
the grave, and these are good bets to be explicitly coded in sequences of
DNA.

DNA is like machine language whereas 'blue eyes' are like terms from a '4th
generation language' where each term is supported by thousands of machine
language instructions. When we code programs in Java or whatever, each
instruction we write actually is supported by many underlying machine
language operations.

Code is consistently readable/writable language. Readable/writable by
different entities if they employ the same rules of interpreting the code.

I don't know what you mean by a "universal".

So? Interpreting meaning in language is always a constructive process.
Constructive in the sense of a building process. We build meaning. And
natural language is usually ambiguous whether the utterances/strings are
well-formed or not. So building meaning is always model-building that we are
prepared to revise. And so it would have to be in computer algorithms that
try to construct meaning.

Parsing syntax is usually simpler, but as you say we are more than capable
of constructing meaningful, improperly formed grammatical statements. And so
computer algorithms that try to construct meaning would have to have a
couple of layers of syntax parsing. If the statement is not well-formed
grammatically, then pass it to the routines that don't require
well-formedness but guess and construct meaning anyway. By no means
impossible.

You might enjoy a computer science course normally offered in the third
undergraduate year usually called something like 'the theory of computation'
or 'languages and the theory of computation' or 'automata theory'. Computer
science students normally hate it. Because it's very mathematically-oriented
and, well, philosophically meditative. It is very like a math course, but a
kind of mixture of number theory, formal logic, and graph theory. And it's a
course where there's usually a lot of fascinating discussion about the
limits of computation. Because, that's what the course is all about, the
nature and limits of computation. After all, Turing invented the Turing
machine to show that there are some tasks no machine will ever perform. Not
that we can do any of these things either.

This course provides a rigorous way to approach questions about what
machines can or cannot do.

Why wouldn't machines be able to "muddle through working on conjecture and
intuition"? I don't think there's anything theoretically impossible about
that at all.

Yes, well, perhaps poetry is the art of being profoundly vague.

It has its limits, doesn't it.

There are ways to avoid getting caught in infinite loops and that sort of
thing, in programming. For instance, debuggers detect when programs are in
infinite loops and let the programmer exit the code.

I don't think there's anything non-reproducable in how humans handle the
pitfalls of infinite loops and such. Humans have their own problems with
repetitive behavior, of course. Addictions, for instance. We have a hard
time extricating ourselves from habits of mind and physical habits. But we
can do so, not because we are not machines but because we are very
sophisticated machines.

To return, though, to the issue of explicit symbols.

Computers code things in zeros and ones and in higher-level symbols. For
instance in bytes of information. A byte being 8 bits of information. So we
can have 256 explicit symbols of the form
00000000
00000001
00000010
00000011
00000100
00000101
.
.
.
One of these can mean 'a', another 'b', and so on.

Now how does the brain code information for our memories? Well we don't
know. But I expect there will be some minimally representational code or
language so that we can keep things straight over time.

Neural nets and similar information devices/architectures may provide some
means for obviating the need for overly representational codings of memory,
but I expect there will be some underlying substratum of representational,
explicit code perhaps similar in form to how the body reads/writes DNA.

  The ukiaHaiku festival welcomes your submissions of poems by Friday,
  March 13
  Note: we are offering new prizes starting at $100 in the "Adult,
  Contemporary" category! Please see Haiku about the festival below.

  Haiku are blossoming once again among poets new and old as the 7th
  annual ukiaHaiku festival quickly approaches. Ukiah's Poet Laureate
  Committee invites submissions of haiku by experienced and
  inexperienced poets of all ages by Friday, March 13. Haiku are brief
  3-line poems that offer a "snapshot" of a scene or a moment in time.
  Unlike many other kinds of poems, haiku usually do not include rhyme,
  alliteration, or punctuation. For guidelines on how to write haiku,
  to read winning poems from years past, and to learn about the
  available categories and submission methods, go to www.ukiahaiku.org.
  Forms can also be obtained at all of the county's libraries,
  including the bookmobile, as well as at Grace Hudson Museum (431 S.
  School Street, Ukiah).

  Submissions are free in all categories (which are organized by age
  group and subject matter) except for the Contemporary Haiku-Adult
  Category, which costs $5 for up to 3 poems. Examples of other
  categories are "Children, All Topics, K-3rd grade," "Haiku About
  Ukiah, 7th-12th grade," and "Traditional Haiku - Adult." Prizes are
  very modest in all categories except "Contemporary Haiku - Adult,"
  for which awards of $100, $50, and $25 are being given this year for
  the first time. All winning poems will also be published in a book.

  Unless otherwise specified, all haiku can be submitted in either the
  traditional (5-7-5 syllable-count) format or the contemporary
  (briefer, non-syllable counting) format. Teachers who wish to invite
  a poet into their classroom to guide students in writing haiku should
  contact Ukiah's Poet Laureate David Smith-Ferri at 467-0468, or email
  him at smithferri@pacific.net. For more "how-to" information on
  writing haiku, go to www.ahapoetry.com, the website of well-known
  haiku poet and ukiaHaiku festival judge Jane Reichhold. The awards
  ceremony will take place on Sunday, March 26, from 2-4 p.m. at the
  Ukiah Conference Center.

  P.S. For those who haven't noticed, "Ukiah" spells "Haiku" backwards!

Shoe Sculpture Honors Iraqi Journalist


By VOA News


30 January 2009




Iraqis are paying tribute to the journalist who threw his shoes at
then-President George Bush at a statue dedicated to the incident.


A large bronze sculpture of a shoe, accompanied by an ode to journalist Mun=
tazer al-Zaidi, was unveiled Thursday in Tikrit.


Zaidi gained instant fame during a Baghdad news conference last
month, throwing his shoes to express his anger at the U.S.-led invasion
of his country. His act inspired thousands across the Middle East to
carry shoes in rallies of solidarity.

He is currently in jail awaiting trial.


Tikrit is the hometown of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
After a Baghdad statue of Saddam was toppled in 2003, Iraqis displayed
their disgust with him by hitting the sculpture with shoes and slippers.

Subject:      seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics

edited by rob mclennan
designed by Roland Prevost;

http://www.ottawater.com/seventeenseconds/

seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics comes out as the
natural extension of the eight issues of Poetics.ca edited by rob mclennan
and Stephen Brockwell. Highlighting the diversity of voice, style,
practice and politic, seventeen seconds continues the resolve to provide a
forum for dialogue on contemporary poetics, with a focus on Canadian
writing. Over the past two decades, the amount of critical writing
published in print literary journals on Canadian poetry, specifically,
seems to have decreased dramatically, but slowly returned through a number
of online journals. seventeen seconds simply wishes to help strengthen the
dialogue and the ongoing conversation about writing through publishing new
writing, and conversation about new writing. How else are we supposed to
learn anything, unless we keep talking?

Feedback and submission queries are most welcome.az421 (at) freenet (dot)

Chain Home - by Gil McElroy

Poems for the Millennium Vol III: with editors JEROME ROTHENBERG & =
JEFFREY ROBINSON, featuring the Editors with WILL ALEXANDER, DAVID =
MATLIN, DOUGLAS MESSERLI, and SIMONE FORTI.


Come for a launch of the new Poems for the Millennium, Vol III: The UC =
Book of Romantic and Postromantic Poetry, edited by JEROME ROTHENBERG & =
JEFFREY ROBINSON. Like Volumes I and II, the new Poems for the =
Millennium sets forth, in a feast, the globally decentered, =
experimental, visionary, radical, and global elements of the 19th =
century and before that precede our multiple avant-gardes. The book =
features far more than canonical romantics and postromantics like =
Rimbaud, Blake, Goethe, Shelley, H=F6lderlin, Hugo, Pushkin, Whitman, =
Dickinson, and Baudelaire, with manifestoes and the work of lesser known =
experimenters like Dionysos Solomos, Cyprian Norwid, Sousandrade, Adah =
Isaacs Menken, Arno Holz, and Yosano Akiko, Shaker poems, ancient and =
tribal works, and varied written, visual, sound, and spoken experiments. =
 Beyond Baroque is at 681 Venice Boulevard in Los Angeles, and the =
Millennium reading and launch, with copies of the book available, is =
free and open to the public.=20

Troy,
French literature IS thriving.
The language legislation you refer to has been dead for years.
Best not to talk about things you don't know about.

From Ben Evans:

I am writing to you to announce the launch of our new arts
review, Fogged Clarity.=A0 Our
February (debut) issue is free and available at http://foggedclarity.com/.=
=A0 In it you will find new work from poets
Bruce Smith, Amy King, and Barry Schwabsky, experimental photography by Kyl=
e
Jones and Ryan Daly, short fiction by Dmitri Gheorgheni, and much more.=A0=
=A0 Fogged Clarity aims to transcend the
conventions of the typical literary review by incorporating music, the visu=
al
arts, interviews, and political exposition.=A0
Our ambition is to form a community of artists whose interaction is not
constrained by medium, but broadened by a collective love of expression.=A0=
 Our network is extensive, and our passion
for ventilation intense.=A0 We sincerely
hope you will join us as we embark on this journey.

=A0

I wish you the best,=20

=A0

Benjamin Evans

Editor, Fogged Clarity

Subject: With + Stand 3 call for submissions


"Critique does not simply liquidate the system." -Adorno, Negative
Dialectics

With + Stand seeks submissions for its third iteration, the red issue. This
issue will take shape over the next month and will be available at the With
+ Stand edition of the Canessa Gallery Reading Series in San Francisco on
March 14th 2009. Please send submissions as a .doc to
withplusstand@gmail.com by February 28th.

Docs should consist of a single face of a single 8.5 x 11" page, formatted
to your liking, and responding to the following:

Recent crises in global capitalism have functioned, as crises often do, to
reveal the historical contours of the present, providing new opportunities
to read history against the grain and to unsettle established assumptions.
This call for [poems/essays/manifestos] proposes that as our economies enter
a period of potentially profound structural transformation, it is all the
more necessary to examine the relationship between the economic mode of
production and cultural and social forms in the period after WWII.

Special thanks to Berkeley's Interdisciplinary Marxist Working Group for
lending their CFP.

Never mind some of the excellent work being done in former colonies, =20
like the work of Patrick Chamoiseau. or even just white french =20

FoggedClarity.com seeks exceptional fiction and poetry



Arts Review *Fogged Clarity* is now accepting submissions for our March and
April editions.  Submissions should be sent to submissions@foggedclarity.com
.  Our February (debut) issue is free and available at www.foggedclarity.com
.  In it you will find new work from poets Bruce Smith, Amy King, and Peter
Ciccariello, experimental photography by Kyle Jones and Ryan Daly, short
fiction by Dmitri Gheorgheni, and much more.   *Fogged Clarity *aims to
transcend the conventions of the typical literary review by incorporating
music, the visual arts, interviews, and political exposition.  Our ambition
is to form a community of artists whose interaction is not constrained by
medium, but broadened by a collective love of expression.  Our network is
extensive, and our passion for ventilation intense.  We sincerely hope you
will join us, and share the fruits of your own fogged clarity.



I wish you the best,



Benjamin Evans

Executive Editor, *Fogged Clarity*

Apparently you didn't read my comments on the Francophone vs. French litera=
tures. I said the French haven't produced much of note. I'm not all that im=
pressed by Houellebecq. If the novel is supposed to remind us of aspects of=
 existence we have forgotten and continue to forget, Houellebecq isn't much=
 of a novelist. His postmodern nihilism is old and tired and deserves to go=
 the way of the dodo. Of course, that goes with all of postmodernism, which=
 is doing nothing more than rehashing cliches anymore. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=

:-)  dangerous words!  my experience is that they are englishes that bring
in the local culture in all kinds of ways--with addition of local words
and expressions, variations in grammar, different accents obviously, and
what i would call a different heart.  in some cases i think there are more
things that can be said--or perhaps some british things could not be said,
but some non-british things certainly could.  and the things said in the
non-e.g.-british english could not be said in british english because the
hearts of the cultures/languages are different.  there's that story about
wittgenstein's "aha" moment watching a venetian gondolier make some
gesture and realizing that meaning hangs on the lives lived around, in and
with it, not on the word to thing tie he'd been looking for in the
tractatus.  all best, gabe

If the post was rejected for some other reason, I would respectfully =20
request a brief explanation as to why, so I can either adjust future =20

Speaking of inspiring French artists, here's a new piece by Paris's
Christophe Bruno. The announcement concerns his piece The Dadameter. You can
see some of the piece itself at http://iterature.com/dadameter , but the
announcement concerns a presentation in Paris by Christophe that happens Feb
5.

Upgrade!Paris #20
Christophe Bruno
María Inés Rodríguez
Dominique Moulon

Thursday 5 Feb., Paris, 7pm
At Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts,
In the conferences room, 1st floor of Palais des études
14 rue Bonaparte, 75006 Paris
M° Saint-Germain des Pres

*Christophe Bruno will present the Dadametre*
With María Inés Rodríguez and Dominique Moulon

Global index of the decay of the aura of language, the *Dadameter* aims at
measuring our distance to Dada. It was inspired by the work of the french
writer Raymond Roussel. The project is a satire about the recent
transmutation of language into a global market ruled by Google and uses the
most up-to-date technologies of control to draw cartographies of language at
large scale.
Actually exhibited at the Jeu de Paume virtual space, second part of the
Satellite Programmation (curator: María Inés Rodríguez).
http://www.jeudepaume.org
Production: Rencontres Internationales Paris-Berlin-Madrid / Jeu de Paume

*Christophe Bruno* lives and works in Paris. He began his artistic activity
in September 2001. His polymorphic work (installations, performances,
conceptual pieces&#8230;) has a critical take on network phenomena and
globalisation in the field of language and images. He was awarded a prize at
the Madrid Contemporary Art Fair with the ARCO new media prize 2007, at the
Prix Ars Electronica 2003 and the Piemonte Share Festival in 2007.
http://www.christophebruno.com

*María Inés Rodríguez* is curator of the  Jeu de Paume' Satellite
Programmation.

*Dominique Moulon* writes on digital art and teaches new media.

Ciccariello, experimental photography by Kyle Jones and Ryan Daly, short

transcend the conventions of the typical literary review by incorporating
music, the visual arts, interviews, and political exposition.  Our ambition

medium, but broadened by a collective love of expression.  Our network is
extensive, and our passion for ventilation intense.  We sincerely hope you
will join us, and share the fruits of your own fogged clarity.



I wish you the best,

I think two very specific uses of the word code sort of got mixed up in this
conversation.

Computer codes are written in a computer language.  Some by computer codes,
but there really was a (human) first mover in some fashion for all these
cases.  While some new computer languages, people here tell me, are not
based on numerals or letters or groovy pictures, most of the ubiquitous ones
are.  Especially scripting languages are filled with easy-to-read English
commands.  What are they made of?  Text files, mostly, text files compiled
and interpreted.  What are they stored in?  Libraries.  Seems pretty
readable, and not only by computers.  Now, at some level, they are reduced
to electrical impulses going through logic gates, or whatever, but so are
digitally recorded (I typed "recoded" and like that too) songs and dumb
movies.

The example of genetic code is a different use of the word code.  For one
thing, we understand and interpret what it is some of genetics does by
describing it as "code."  It is neato keen, but it is nature at its essence,
not a bunch of symbols some humans dreamed.

After I return from the landfill, perhaps I will tackle the universal.

I also ask, what isn't an information architecture to one capable of
interpretation or projection?

All best,
Catherine

You will find a critical review by Giles Askham of the Transmediale.09
Deep North Festival in Berlin, Germany.  The Festival purports to
construct an impression of the polar regions as a place that can be
"imagined but never truly captured."  In seeking to move beyond
prevailing notions of catastrophic environmental change and to examine
its broader cultural consequences, the Festival aims to adapt and
explore creative technologies and point the way to political and
artistic transformation and creative sustainability.

This review is published by Furtherfield.org, coordinated by Marc
Garrett and Ruth Catlow, and based in London, England.

Furtherfield.org believes that through creative and critical
engagement with practices in art, poetry, and technology people are
inspired and enabled to become active co-creators of their cultures
and societies.  Furtherfield.org provides platforms for creating,
viewing, discussing and learning about experimental practices at the
intersections of the arts, technology, and social change.

Correspondance (a sketchbook) by Joseph F. Keppler.  Digital art.

=93What can I call this work?  Neither painting nor critique yet =20
informed by art, the following are sketches to me.  Rather than =20

What the cognoscenti are saying about Correspondance (a sketchbook):

=93Readability and meaning construction, as well as the relation between =
=20
the visual and the literary, have been concerns of Joe=92s for many =20
years.  In Correspondance we see Joe, who is also an astute critic on =20=

both literary and visual art, take an artist=92s approach, a visual =20
poet=92s approach, a visual artist=92s approach.  Joe Keppler is very =20=

unusual in his deep engagement both with art history and the =20
literary.  He=92s a poet, a visual poet, a sound poet, a sculptor of =20
steel, a photographer, a painter, a polyartist.  Not only in his =20
practice but in his wide reading and viewing of contemporary and =20
historical work.  I don=92t know anybody else as voracious as he is not =20=

only in his own artistic practice but in learning about art and =20
philosophy.  He is an incredibly learned man as well as an important =20
poet and artist.  He shows us what it now means to be literate.=94  =97Jim=

=93Correspondance is suffused with correspondence, bright exchanges =20
between artist and subject, playful responses between form, light, =20
color, and art history.  Poet and sculptor, Joe Keppler brings both =20
mediums to bear, poetry and sculpture, word and material, hand in =20
hand.  Keppler adds a third-dimension to the graceful dance (Joe the =20
humble artist says, =91bump=92) through his lifelong study of painting =
and =20
sculpture: allusions to significant works, quotations of style, and =20
adaptations that bring old works to new life.  In this series of =20

Well, how else am I to take "but then again you don't seem to pay much mind=

one outside of France and not of French descent who speaks French. Now, as =
for Mittelholzer, I do admit to being a little behind on my Caribbean ficti=

s hard to get to everything in the fifteen years I've been pursuing literar=
y studies and creative writing. There is indeed a lot of good work in Frenc=

use they don't have a bunch of French academics hanging over them telling t=

open to creative use and investigation. The French should call home all the=

The English language is evolving the use of the postposition, which is present in many other languages.

And, to paraphrase Pinker, if you understood what I said, it was grammatical.

to back up a few steps. to me, poetry is distinguished by the intensity of
its engagement with language, intensest who what where when why why not if
then and yet. the issues of code and language in dna and how the brain
stores and processes information--the mindless organic codes and languages
in our bodies inscribed by the processes of evolution to store and process
knowledge, experience, reactivity, and the history and structure of our
physiology--are strongly contemporary not only in matters of language but
concerning who and what we are. so of course these issues are 'naturals' for
poetry and poetics.

and i can't help but think that the knowledge that we have cultivated over
the last sixty years about information via computer science will be of great
consequence in unravelling the structure of memory in the brain--by
providing us a sense of how data can be structured.

in all of this, issues of code and language are prominent. the ability to
form representations and store, retrieve, and process them implicitly
involves the notion of code/language. regardless of whether the
representations are stored in explicit symbols or however they are stored,
retrieved, and processed. whatever the nature of the representation, if we
form representations and store them, retrieve them, and process them, then
they are functioning as explicit symbols do, in many ways, even if they are
perhaps unlike them in others.

Well, I think that something like what you are saying does obtain,
but I believe that you are speaking of places such as India, Jamaica,
Uganda,
the USA, places where English has been one of the official languages.
Universities
in those places teach in English, for example. But I was speaking, of
course, of places
to which English is spreading, as I said. I mean that the English
spoken in businesses
in Japan, clubs in Peru, cafes in Thailand, during drug deals in
Bolivia and Viet Nam, etc.
Yes, the English language is being spoken by a lot more people in a
lot more places. But I do not think that
the barber who speaks English in the Dominican Republic is likely to
use the past imperfect.
I dont think the cab driver in Beirut will argue with you about Keynes.
The way I heard it, as US pop products spread around the world so
does the language
that reaches its level. But boat rental English in the Maldives is
not as complex
as English even in a place like Indianapolis.

For those who actually are interested in French culture, and not just
categorically dismissing an entire national literature a la Horace Engdahl,
KCRW's bookworm has done a really good series over the last several months
called "An American Bookworm in Paris." I imagine Bookworm is usually a
little too middlebrow for this list, but I think you will find many of the
interviews of great interest. The interviews include:

Camille de Toledo
Pierre Alf=E9ri
Emmanuel Carr=E8re
Gr=E9goire Bouillier
Olivier Cadiot
Marc Cholodenko
Dennis Cooper (sort of the reverse Le Clezio, an American who moved to
France)

You can download all of these at the Bookworm website:
http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw

The last two episodes are up on the main page, and if you click on "older
shows" you should be able to find the first three epsides on the next coupl=
e
of pages. If you can't find them, let me know and I can post links.

Even the notion of French academics "hanging over" people "telling them their French isn't French enough" is a vulgar caricature.  Leopold Senghor was a member of the French Academy, and Assia Djebar presently is, and neither was/is an "academic" properly speaking, nor inclined to police the language (read their work).  And no, my friend, your postings, with their strength-through-joy (or was that holiness-through-health?), free-market idolatry, extolling of the soporific Frederick Turner and the Few Normalism, I mean New Formalism (not he of the manifest destiny, though he might as well be), in fact have shown any indication of any interest at all in non-whites.  I understand that this is only an example of the provincialism that besets North American letters as a whole, and as such is more a sin of omission than commission. All the writers you mention are worthy -- I hope you take Lovelace's humanism to heart.

And by the way, I think all troops everywhere should be demobilized and sent home.  Everywhere.  Disband all the armies.

Hello poetry fans,

Evan Munday from Coach House Books here, announcing a big poetry =20
launch during the AWP that you may want to check out:

CHICAGO LAUNCH FOR SINA QUEYRAS'S EXPRESSWAY

During the AWP Conference festivities, Links Hall is hosting several =20
literary events, among them, the launch of Sina Queyras's new poetry =20
collection, Expressway. Expressway, inspired by the modes of the =20
Romantic poets, explores the subject of modern transportation.

Sina Queyras, winner of a Lambda Award (for her previous book, Lemon =20
Hound), former co-curator of the Belladonna series and noted poetry =20
blogger (lemonhound.blogspot.com), launches Expressway on Thursday, =20
February 12, with the help of some friends. Reading with Queyras will =20=

be Vanessa Place (Dies: A Sentence), Adam Sol (Jeremiah, Ohio) and =20
Kevin Connolly (Revolver).

We hope you'll join us. Please see below for event details and more =20
information about Expressway and all the authors. And check out the =20
trailer for Expressway at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DUi9Qw_RtWRk

Chicago Launch of Sina Queyras's Expressway

About Expressway:

Echoing the pastoral and elegiac modes of the Romantic poets, whose =20
reverence for nature never prevented them from addressing it with all =20=

ideas and sensibilities their times allowed, Sina Queyras=92s stunning =20=

new collection explores the infrastructures and means of modern =20
mobility. Addressing the human project not so much as something =20
imposed on nature but as an increasingly disturbing activity within =20
it, Expressway exposes the paradox of modern movement and connection: =20=

we build more and more roads and highways (concrete and fibre optic), =20=

but rather than feeling more connected =96 to the natural, to each other =
=20
=96 the more disenfranchised and anxious we seem to become. 'Cleanse the =
=20
doors of perception,' Blake urged, and with that in mind, Queyras has =20=

written a bravely lyrical critique of our ethical and ecological =20
imprint, a legacy easily blamed on corporations and commerce, but one =20=

we=92ve allowed, through our tacit acquiescence, to overwhelm us. Every =20=

brush stroke, every bolt, and nut, every form and curve in our =20
networks of oil and rubber, every thought and its material outcome =96 =20=

each decision can make or unmake us.

SINA QUEYRAS is the author of Lemon Hound, which won the Pat Lowther =20
Award and a Lambda Award, as well as the poetry collections Slip and =20
Teethmarks. She edited the anthology Open Field: 30 Contemporary =20
Canadian Poets. She has taught creative writing at Rutgers and =20
Haverford. A former curator of New York City=92s belladonna* reading =20
series, Queyras currently lives in Montreal.

VANESSA PLACE is the author of Dies: A Sentence (Les Figues Press), =20
and a chapbook, Figure from The Gates of Paradise (Woodland Editions). =20=

Other work has appeared in Northwest Review, Contemporary Literary =20
Criticism, and Five Fingers Review.

ADAM SOL is the author of two collections of poetry, Jonah's Promise, =20=

which won Mid-List Press's First Series Award for Poetry, and Crowd of =20=

Sounds, which won the Trillium Award for Poetry. He is also the author =20=

of numerous essays and reviews, and teaches English at the Laurentian =20=

University at Georgian College Program.

KEVIN CONNOLLY is the author of Revolver (Anansi, 2008). Connolly's =20
first collection of poems, Asphalt Cigar (Coach House, 1995), was =20

The distinction I want to make is between a natural phenomena which
we can glean information from and something that is created
specifically to be meaningful. Or to put it another way, I want to be
very careful about the analogy you're making between a code built
from a language, like assembly language or machine code, which
describe specific explicit operations of a calculating machine, and
the "genetic code" which can be extrapolated from the chemical
components of DNA. The things seem to me to be similar, but have
important differences. For example, DNA is like the fossil record or
the geological column. It's the result of natural processes which can
be examined, tests can be run on, and empirical facts can be
associated with. A geologist can look at a cliff face and with a few
tests and some knowledge of geology can learn something about the age
of the cliff, the date that fossils formed, the composition of
certain layers and how the cliff came to be where it was. DNA is
analagous to this. A geneticist can look at a sequence of chemicals,
mark the sequence of them, and can learn things about the creature
the DNA comes from with some tests and some knowledge of genetics.
That to me seems different from feeding a set of instructions into a
computer telling it to make certain operations in order to produce a
desired result. So while machine code and DNA "code" are analagous in
some ways, they aren't analagous in others that in my view at least
are much more important. They are analagous in that information can
be got from them, but they are not analagous in either the nature or
the purposefulness of that information. Since mathematics in my view,
which is what machine code is limited to in it's operations along
with some functions for storing and recalling pieces of coded data
stored in memory, is merely a constructed language with certain
limitations placed on it i think this is an important disinction.
It's important because I don't think that it's obvious that
mathematical operations plus memory equal all the functions necessary
for the baseline operations of consciousness. More importantly, even
if it is, I'm not sure that it's clear that that's how human minds
work. the physical differnences between the electromagnetic functions
of charge that happen at the base of microcomputing and the chemical
functions at the root of the human brain aside, there are all kinds
of things that happen in human function that at least do not appear
to be quantizable in a way that would be necessary in order for
mathematical operations to deal with. And if they are not, then I
don't know how you get to using such function (sense perception
probably being the most important of them) in a mathematical context.
To be completely clear at the risk of seeming pedantic, while such a
thing might be modeled mathematically, i think it should always be
born in mind that model is not the thing it models and this is a
reason to be skeptical of claims that the model can achieve all of
the phenomena of the thing modeled. It may produce simulations of
that thing, but the difference in kind is strong enough that I think
it's a difficult thing to make arguments from analogy of this sort.

I guess my problem is that i don't see how computers do anything
semantic at all. Without fully embracing the Chinese Room problem (i
think yr familiar with that thought experiment, right? i seem to
remember we've talked about it before), while a suitably complex
parser might be able to find a way through a non well formed
statement, the real problem for machine intelligence is not coping
with such input but being able to produce it as an output in a
meaningful way. I find things like Erica for example to be very
impressive, but it's clear to me at least that there would be
something mistaken about saying that Erica means what it says.

like Uncle ludwig i have some problems with Turing. Have you ever
read the lectures on the foundations of mathematics? Turing attended
a number of the lectures and he and Wittgenstein butted heads about
the foundations of mathematics in very interesting ways. what's
particularly interesting to me about turing is that computers are
defined by computability, that is a computer is a thing that can do
what computers can do. The word itself used to be used as a job
description for certain mathematicians who did hard math sort of
automatically for institutions that needed lots of heavy calculations
done. Charles Peirce for example once did that sort of work for the
united states geological survey department. But humans are different
from computers in that we extend beyond the nature of program
following. We can choose to ignore our programming if we wish. More
to the point, I know for a fact that I, as a potential turing
machine, am not vulnerable to the halting problem because I know that
I can choose to halt because I am arbitrarily capable of choosing to
by breaking the algorithm. So while it's true that people do form
habits, we are also capable of breaking them. Just ask Bill W.

Not really. In fact, it's precisely the absence of limits that makes
it so interesting. There's an area where it works and an area where
it doesn't, but the boundary between them, if anything can only be
defined as asymptotic.

This is where we disagree, and I think possibly fundamentally. I
don't think that it's correct to call something that you can glean
information from a code or a language simply because you can read it
like a code or a language. language is a particular kind of activity
that language users engage in. Moreover, it's worth noting that this
works both ways. through empirical work, I think we have a reasonable
expectation that at some point in the future we will be able to
examine someone's brain and "read" memories from it by the state.
That's not true of all language. Take Linear A for example. Here we
have an example of a written language that we KNOW is a written
language. There was a time i the distant past when the Minoans on
crete read and wrote that language. But without further clues from
archaeology, which may or may not exist, we will probably never be
able to learn how to read it despite the fact taht we know it is
readable. Which is to say that it's clear that there's a disconnect
between readability and language, and the argument I would like to
make is that complex language response on it's own is not enough for
rudimentary mind behavior. just because there is information stored
in an explicit way, as all things that are physical are in some sense
explicitly definable above the level of quantum mechanics, it doesn't
mean that the way those things are USED are explicit in the human
mind in the way that they are used by computers, that is, always as
explicit symbols from top to bottom. The difference, if machine
intelligence is possible, is in breaking from explicit symbol
manipulation and the endless march of syntax to allow for the
beginning of semantics to be emitted by the machine. Until you get to
that point though, I don't think the analogy between minds and
computers holds up and I'm unaware of any computer scientists who
have been successful there.

That is not true in Canada.
We have quite a few French-speakers in Canada,
and the word "francophone" usually refers to a person of French descent.
It generally refers to a person's first language.

You shouldn't be throwing around terms like "vulgar caricature" considering your own vulgar caricature of Frederick Turner. You might consider broadening your education to include his writing, especially "Natural Classicism," "The Culture of Hope" and "Natural Religion." His desire for a world community, including a world community of letters, is also mine. Turner's a natural classicist, meaning he writes the way he writes is based on the historical-cultural nature of poetry. For example, he has done research showing that poems around the world, throughout history, throughout cultures, regardless of language, are broken up into lines, and that those lines are 3-5 seconds lone -- the same length as our short term memory slot, and our auditory present. This is a common feature of poetry and songs. Excepting the postmodern poems dominant among educated elites.

As for my posting on health and the holy, it was a work that argued that we should have a truly inclusive world view. We should understand each other through both our differences and our commonalities.  The postmodern emphasis on differences is deeply rooted in racism, sexism, etc. that have divided human beings for much too long. It is time we rejected such a divisive world view and learned to love each other for our commonalities as well as celebrate our differences. Both simultaneously. Unity in variety and variety in unity.

My own more recent work draws from Japanese Noh plays, ancient Greek tragedies (a truly foreign culture, if you truly understand it), and Kalidasa -- as well as Shakespeare and Tom Stoppard, among others.

I myself am a literary Francophile, and I criticize out of love for the literature. I don't detect the same motives from you.

I've never found you particularly pleasant in the way you argue.

But I wasn't even talking to you. You just decided to jump in to throw in your own divisive words. Those of us who were having this discussion have done quite fine without this noncontrabution. For example, I now have quite a reading list. No thanks to you or this post.

I nave noticed that despite the fact that you cannot give a single specific instance of my saying anything racist, you keep accusing me of it. All such accusations are are shortcuts to thinking and are designed to sidetrack arguments away from the issues. QUite frankly, your accusations remind me of those homophobes who think everyone else is gay and who openly, vociferously condemn homosexuals and perceived homosexuals every chance they get. Methinks you doth protest too much. Those who go around accusing everyone under the sun of racism are themselves the biggest racists, feel guilty about it, and, not wanting to feel guilty, project their feelings onto others, accusing those others of what they themselves are. SO please keep your racism and accusations of racism to yourself.

Participating in "discussions" with you inevitably ends badly, devolving in=
to you labeling the participants and name calling (where does *that* compul=
sion to label come from??) without you ever considering the possibility tha=
t you might-not-be-right-all-of-the-time -- gasp!=A0=A0 Never a concession =
from you ...where's the "discussion" in that?=A0 "Troy's spin" is certainly=
 to be avoided.=A0=A0 Esp since your angry argumentative energy is endless.=
=A0=20

And Troy, calling me a "racist" and a "homophobe" now:=A0 *case in point.*

I've never found you particularly pleasant in the way you argue.=20

But I wasn't even talking to you. You just decided to jump in to throw in
your own divisive words. Those of us who were having this discussion have d=
one
quite fine without this noncontrabution. For example, I now have quite a re=
ading
list. No thanks to you or this post.

I nave noticed that despite the fact that you cannot give a single specific
instance of my saying anything racist, you keep accusing me of it. All such
accusations are are shortcuts to thinking and are designed to sidetrack
arguments away from the issues. QUite frankly, your accusations remind me o=
f
those homophobes who think everyone else is gay and who openly, vociferousl=
y
condemn homosexuals and perceived homosexuals every chance they get. Methin=
ks
you doth protest too much. Those who go around accusing everyone under the =
sun
of racism are themselves the biggest racists, feel guilty about it, and, no=
t
wanting to feel guilty, project their feelings onto others, accusing those
others of what they themselves are. SO please keep your racism and accusati=
ons
of racism to yourself.=20

Troy,

In your take on things, *you* are always the one who is misunderstood, nobl=
e,
and well intentioned -- as opposed to everyone you respond to.  You, who in=
sist
on labeling and characterizing everyone at every turn, "postmodern"
being your most common accusation/insult.  And the regular citing of your
"Mexican American" "minority" wife as if she were the elixir
against any possible racist sentiment you may have learned and be unaware o=
f in
your own ideas on life and literature...  You refuse to even consider that
possibility, consistently and adamantly, because everyone else is this labe=
l or
that label you deem demeaning enough for them and elevating enough for your=
self.
 You "criticize out of love"?  Funny that.  If yours is not one of the
most divisive ways to go about discussion, I'll eat my shorts.

Be well,
Amy

You shouldn't be throwing around terms like "vulgar caricature"
considering your own vulgar caricature of Frederick Turner. You might consi=
der
broadening your education to include his writing, especially "Natural
Classicism," "The Culture of Hope" and "Natural
Religion." His desire for a world community, including a world community
of
letters, is also mine. Turner's a natural classicist, meaning he writes the
way he writes is based on the historical-cultural nature of poetry. For
example,
he has done research showing that poems around the world, throughout histor=
y,
throughout cultures, regardless of language, are broken up into lines, and =
that
those lines are 3-5 seconds lone -- the same length as our short term memor=
y
slot, and our auditory present. This is a common feature of poetry and song=
s.
Excepting the postmodern poems dominant among educated elites.=20

As for my posting on health and the holy, it was a work that argued that we
should have a truly inclusive world view. We should understand each other
through both our differences and our commonalities.  The postmodern emphasi=
s on
differences is deeply rooted in racism, sexism, etc. that have divided huma=
n
beings for much too long. It is time we rejected such a divisive world view=
 and
learned to love each other for our commonalities as well as celebrate our
differences. Both simultaneously. Unity in variety and variety in unity.=20

My own more recent work draws from Japanese Noh plays, ancient Greek traged=
ies
(a truly foreign culture, if you truly understand it), and Kalidasa -- as w=
ell
as Shakespeare and Tom Stoppard, among others.=20

I myself am a literary Francophile, and I criticize out of love for the
literature. I don't detect the same motives from you.=20

Even the notion of French academics "hanging over" people
"telling them their French isn't French enough" is a vulgar
caricature.  Leopold Senghor was a member of the French Academy, and Assia
Djebar presently is, and neither was/is an "academic" properly
speaking, nor inclined to police the language (read their work).  And no, m=
y
friend, your postings, with their strength-through-joy (or was that
holiness-through-health?), free-market idolatry, extolling of the soporific
Frederick Turner and the Few Normalism, I mean New Formalism (not he of the
manifest destiny, though he might as well be), in fact have shown any
indication
of any interest at all in non-whites.  I understand that this is only an
example
of the provincialism that besets North American letters as a whole, and as =
such
is more a sin of omission than commission. All the writers you mention are
worthy -- I hope you take Lovelace's humanism to heart.

And by the way, I think all troops everywhere should be demobilized and sen=
t
home.  Everywhere.  Disband all the armies.

Those among you who are New Yorkers and are interested in innovative text p=
erformance and/or formally odd political theater might be interested in see=
ing the performances my trio, the Nonsense Company, are doing in town over =
the next two weeks. We've been taking these pieces around for a couple of y=
ears now, and I think they're in really good shape.=20

"Great Hymn of Thanksgiving" (by Rick Burkhardt) is a meticulously scored p=
iece for three speaking percussionists around a dinner table setup, centeri=
ng on elaborate group speech techniques (switching speakers in mid-syllable=
, imitating channel-switching TVs at various distances, performing dinner t=
able chitchat in the mode of hymns and news reports from Iraq in the mode o=
f children's storytelling, rapid and long unisons) and precise percussion p=
laying (on dishes, tuned glasses, the table itself, and supplementary autoh=
arp, toy piano and steel drum). The piece interrogates language as our main=
 environment, pulling it apart to show the functions that often operate in =
spite of its meanings. It's also, I think, very interesting music that focu=
ses attention on tiny details and fragile noises (at least audience respons=
e has made it seem that way).=20

"Conversation Storm" (also by Burkhardt, and just published in the antholog=
y "Plays and Playwrights 2009") is about arguing about torture: how do you =
engage in an argument on a topic whose status as subject to debate is alrea=
dy a betrayal? Is refusing to talk about it as much a brutalization of one'=
s own position as it would be to enter into the argument on its distorted t=
erms? It's also about role-playing and narration. Time is distorted, mixed =
up, truncated or stretched; the actors switch scenes in mid-word; character=
s lose track of their performers and float to reattach themselves to unsusp=
ecting victims.=A0 =A0=20

The performances take place at the IRT (Interborough Repertory Theater), 15=
4 Christopher St., 3B, February 5-15. 8 p.m. W-Sat, 3 p.m. Sun. (no perform=
ances on Monday and Tuesday). Tickets are $15. For more info, visit http://=
www.nonsensecompany.com.=20

Hope some of you can make it!

all the best to you,

All such accusations are are shortcuts to thinking and are designed to sidetrack arguments away from the issues. QUite frankly, your accusations remind me of those homophobes who think everyone else is gay and who openly, vociferously condemn homosexuals and perceived homosexuals every chance they get. Methinks you doth protest too much. Those who go around accusing everyone under the sun of racism are themselves the biggest racists, feel guilty about it, and, not wanting to feel guilty, project their feelings onto others, accusing those others of what they themselves are. SO please keep your racism and accusations of racism to yourself.

You, who insist on labeling and characterizing everyone at every turn, "postmodern" being your most common accusation/insult.  And the regular citing of your "Mexican American" "minority" wife as if she were the elixir against any possible racist sentiment you may have learned and be unaware of in your own ideas on life and literature...  You refuse to even consider that possibility, consistently and adamantly, because everyone else is this label or that label you deem demeaning enough for them and elevating enough for yourself.  You "criticize out of love"?  Funny that.  If yours is not one of the most divisive ways to go about discussion, I'll eat my shorts.

We invite you to THE NOWHERE DANCE

A performance at Alan Sondheim's Second Life exhibition "The Accidental
Artist"

Alan Sondheim: "We'll teleport people into an installation which has been=
=20
constructed over a period of eight months. It represents nothing of=20
architecture, fantasy, or surrealism; it's a space unlike anything in the r=
eal=20
world. It's difficult to move through, a field of alien processes which has=
 a=20
life of its own. Sandy Baldwin and I will dance through and around it - on =
the=20
ground, in the air, and on the ocean floor. Part of the dance will be based=
 on=20
learning to move around; part will be based on adding to the clutter."

on the project b e a m - m e - up:

Our understanding of space is changing for generations. In the digital age =
we=20
use terms like Cyberspace, Globalization and World Wide Web, even though we=
=20
have hardly understood the old electro-spaces like power supply systems,=20

uer=20
new spaces, which present themselves as both picture space and space of act=

s has just printed a new book, which I compiled and edited over the past fo=
ur years, =E2=80=9CDays I Moved Through Ordinary Sounds,=E2=80=9D  w/ forew=
ord by Martin Espada.  The book celebrates 15 years of WritersCorps, a Peac=

less shelters, inner-city schools and centers for newly arrived immigrants.=
  The anthology features the poetry, fiction, plays and memoirs of 50 write=
rs in WritersCorps. Panel performers are renowned writers and former Writer=

(Apparently the author of this article is looking for some answers...)

Where are today's farmer poets?

Farming has changed beyond all recognition since the days of 'poets of
the land' Robert Burns and John Clare

http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/feb/05/farmer-poets-robert-b=
urns

The recent Burns night celebrations reminded me that Scotland's most
famous son was actually a farmer who wrote his best work at night in
his but'n'ben after a day's hard toil in the soil.

Burns wasn't the first agriculturist to put pen to paper, but he did
set a standard in poetry for self-taught writers describing the
landscape from an embedded perspective. There's a great distinction
between these poets, who, because their survival depends on it, have a
far more intimate relationship with the land, and those who describe
it while looking at it from their firesides on the other side of the
window. Chief among the latter are the (largely classically educated)
Romantics, who, though drawing inspiration from the landscape,
romanticised it in a way a farmer never would. (Wordsworth at least
had the gumption to recognise this gulf between romance and reality in
The Leech-Gatherer).

Of the former, perhaps the best-known example after Burns is John
Clare, a farm-labourer by profession who, though patronised at various
points in his life, had no choice but to keep returning to work the
land. Clare's work, though celebrated for displaying an understanding
of the metaphysical on a par with his more acclaimed academic
contemporaries, captured the small details of farming life with a lack
of sentimentality that would have been impossible had he spent his
formative years at, say, Eton, rather than in the Northamptonshire
fields. (Ironically, Clare found it hard to commune with many of his
farming neighbours, who viewed him with suspicion, writing "they
hardly dare talk in my company for fear I should mention them in my
writings and I find more pleasure in wandering the fields than in
musing among my silent neighbours who are insensible to everything but
toiling and talking of it".)

Another fine example of a body of nature poetry that could only have
been written by a man of the land is that of Patrick Kavanagh, who
spent 20 years living the farming life =96 a life which informed his
1936 debut The Ploughman and Other Poems and indeed his more famous
later works, The Great Hunger and his novel Tarry Flynn (and which
later, incidentally, led Brendan Behan to dismiss him as a backwoods
yokel).

Such writers were a far cry from the world of academia and the
literary high society =96 closed-off worlds to most cow-milking,
kale-growing, dung-shovelling poets of yesteryear (though more
recently Seamus Heaney, whose father was a farmer and cattle-dealer,
has made the leap).

All of which begs the question: who are the true British poets of the
land today? Well, I don't actually know, but was hoping you might be
able to tell me. With farming changed beyond all recognition since the
crofting days of Robert Burns, is the best emerging
agricultural-inspired poetry more likely to come from small-holdings
and organic farms and the emerging conservation and ecology movements?
Does the new poetry reflect our changing understanding of farming and
the land around us? I'd welcome any recommendations.

Where are today's farmer poets?

Farming has changed beyond all recognition since the days of 'poets of
the land' Robert Burns and John Clare

http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/feb/05/farmer-poets-robert-b=
urns

The recent Burns night celebrations reminded me that Scotland's most
famous son was actually a farmer who wrote his best work at night in
his but'n'ben after a day's hard toil in the soil.

Burns wasn't the first agriculturist to put pen to paper, but he did
set a standard in poetry for self-taught writers describing the
landscape from an embedded perspective. There's a great distinction
between these poets, who, because their survival depends on it, have a
far more intimate relationship with the land, and those who describe
it while looking at it from their firesides on the other side of the
window. Chief among the latter are the (largely classically educated)
Romantics, who, though drawing inspiration from the landscape,
romanticised it in a way a farmer never would. (Wordsworth at least
had the gumption to recognise this gulf between romance and reality in
The Leech-Gatherer).

Of the former, perhaps the best-known example after Burns is John
Clare, a farm-labourer by profession who, though patronised at various
points in his life, had no choice but to keep returning to work the
land. Clare's work, though celebrated for displaying an understanding
of the metaphysical on a par with his more acclaimed academic
contemporaries, captured the small details of farming life with a lack
of sentimentality that would have been impossible had he spent his
formative years at, say, Eton, rather than in the Northamptonshire
fields. (Ironically, Clare found it hard to commune with many of his

hardly dare talk in my company for fear I should mention them in my
writings and I find more pleasure in wandering the fields than in
musing among my silent neighbours who are insensible to everything but
toiling and talking of it".)

Another fine example of a body of nature poetry that could only have

Many of them are within the Origin anthology from Bob Arnold at his website
for Longhouse Books, www.longhousepoetry.com, and in fact one can point to a
neglected subculture of many poets who work or have worked the land and live
with it, often laboring, etc. Not least of these poets is Arnold himself,
carpenter and stone mason who is also Cid Corman's and Lorine Niedecker's
literary executor, etc.  Anti-academic, for sure, in fact the antidote in a
time when quiet and so-called Quietude are merely mocked and disrespected by
people who often live too high up in their noggins and praise the cerebral
cortex as poetry--talk about "Nature Deficit Disorder"!  And by the way,
ever buy a book from Arnold's astonishing catalog of poetry, etc.?  His
prices are among the best anywhere. So is his service.

Where are today's farmer poets?

Farming has changed beyond all recognition since the days of 'poets of
the land' Robert Burns and John Clare

http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/feb/05/farmer-poets-robert-burns

The recent Burns night celebrations reminded me that Scotland's most
famous son was actually a farmer who wrote his best work at night in
his but'n'ben after a day's hard toil in the soil.

Burns wasn't the first agriculturist to put pen to paper, but he did
set a standard in poetry for self-taught writers describing the
landscape from an embedded perspective. There's a great distinction
between these poets, who, because their survival depends on it, have a
far more intimate relationship with the land, and those who describe
it while looking at it from their firesides on the other side of the
window. Chief among the latter are the (largely classically educated)
Romantics, who, though drawing inspiration from the landscape,
romanticised it in a way a farmer never would. (Wordsworth at least
had the gumption to recognise this gulf between romance and reality in
The Leech-Gatherer).

Of the former, perhaps the best-known example after Burns is John
Clare, a farm-labourer by profession who, though patronised at various
points in his life, had no choice but to keep returning to work the
land. Clare's work, though celebrated for displaying an understanding
of the metaphysical on a par with his more acclaimed academic
contemporaries, captured the small details of farming life with a lack
of sentimentality that would have been impossible had he spent his
formative years at, say, Eton, rather than in the Northamptonshire
fields. (Ironically, Clare found it hard to commune with many of his
farming neighbours, who viewed him with suspicion, writing "they
hardly dare talk in my company for fear I should mention them in my
writings and I find more pleasure in wandering the fields than in
musing among my silent neighbours who are insensible to everything but
toiling and talking of it".)

Another fine example of a body of nature poetry that could only have
been written by a man of the land is that of Patrick Kavanagh, who
spent 20 years living the farming life – a life which informed his
1936 debut The Ploughman and Other Poems and indeed his more famous
later works, The Great Hunger and his novel Tarry Flynn (and which
later, incidentally, led Brendan Behan to dismiss him as a backwoods
yokel).

Such writers were a far cry from the world of academia and the
literary high society – closed-off worlds to most cow-milking,
kale-growing, dung-shovelling poets of yesteryear (though more
recently Seamus Heaney, whose father was a farmer and cattle-dealer,
has made the leap).

All of which begs the question: who are the true British poets of the
land today? Well, I don't actually know, but was hoping you might be
able to tell me. With farming changed beyond all recognition since the
crofting days of Robert Burns, is the best emerging
agricultural-inspired poetry more likely to come from small-holdings
and organic farms and the emerging conservation and ecology movements?
Does the new poetry reflect our changing understanding of farming and
the land around us? I'd welcome any recommendations.

Thursday=2C #R182=2C Joliet 3rd floor (Hilton).


Elegiac Memoirs of
Protest. (Kass Fleisher=2C

Memoir is often about loss=2C but some memoirs take as their primary

narrators hope to incite in the reader an impulse to change the
societal situations that caused the loss. These artifacts mourn as

the lack of language adequate to articulate it. Here=2C form meets

s hard toil in the soil.=0A=0ABurns wasn't the first agriculturist to put p=

describing the=0Alandscape from an embedded perspective. There's a great di=
stinction=0Abetween these poets, who, because their survival depends on it,=
 have a=0Afar more intimate relationship with the land, and those who descr=
ibe=0Ait while looking at it from their firesides on the other side of the=
=0Awindow. Chief among the latter are the (largely classically educated)=0A=
Romantics, who, though drawing inspiration from the landscape,=0Aromanticis=
ed it in a way a farmer never would. (Wordsworth at least=0Ahad the gumptio=
n to recognise this gulf between romance and reality in=0AThe Leech-Gathere=
r).=0A=0AOf the former, perhaps the best-known example after Burns is John=
=0AClare, a farm-labourer by profession who, though patronised at various=
=0Apoints in his life, had no choice but to keep returning to work the=0Ala=
nd. Clare's work, though celebrated for displaying an understanding=0Aof th=
e metaphysical on a par with his more acclaimed academic=0Acontemporaries, =
captured the small details of farming life with a lack=0Aof sentimentality =
that would have been impossible had he spent his=0Aformative years at, say,=
 Eton, rather than in the Northamptonshire=0Afields. (Ironically, Clare fou=
nd it hard to commune with many of his=0Afarming neighbours, who viewed him=
 with suspicion, writing "they=0Ahardly dare talk in my company for fear I =
should mention them in my=0Awritings and I find more pleasure in wandering =
the fields than in=0Amusing among my silent neighbours who are insensible t=

The Emerson Institute for Freedom and Culture is featuring new essays, poems, a play, and a review atwww.emersoninstitute.org

We are always welcoming new work in/on:

fiction
poetry
visual art
interdisciplinary scholarship
culture and society
plays & scripts
songs & music
philosophy & religion
economics
science
book reviews

Remember that we are primarily focused on the arts and humanities, but promotion of liberty is the underlying goal. Good work of any kind will be accepted. Art and literary works should also fall under the rubric of natural classicism as described by Frederick Turner. In short, we prefer stories, rhythmic poetry, and artwork in general that speak to our deep universal humanity.

Hi - I'm writing a generic letter, apologies; I want to find a publisher for my
theoretical work, and everything continues to fall through. At one point
Minnesota was going to work with us - us being Sandy Baldwin, who created a
framework for my texts - and Sandy wasn't able to continue on the project (he's
fully supportive; it was a question of time) - Minnesota withdrew. If you have
any idea or better yet, the possibility of publica- tion, please let me know. I
have a text out with Fort-Da but there's been no money for an ISBN number, so
that's unadvertised; WVU might do something in the future with my texts on
writing, if a series gets going, but that's speculative. The texts I've been
writing have been on two main themes, and have been collected as such - one on
the phenomenology of the analog and digital and their intertwining; and one on
the phenomenology of the real/virtual and their intertwining. The latter uses
Second Life as a model; the former is more purely theoretical. Neither need
illustration.

I feel ridiculous sending out a public letter like this, but I'm at wit's end -
my writing might not be worth collecting for that matter, and I have no
academic affiliation, so it's difficult to get anyone interested. Any help
would be greatly appreciated. Please write me backchannel or ignore this, and
thanks for reading. (I know I write overmuch, but the mss have always been
edited. Salt brought out a book of literary writing in 2004, and that was the
last of it.)

These poetry chapbooks were originally produced in numbered runs of two
hundred copies, once a month, from September 2007 to April 2008, to
correspond with my time in Edmonton as writer-in-residence at the
University of Alberta. All but two, myself and George Bowering, are
Alberta authors, and George's came around the time he did a reading in
Edmonton at the Olive Reading Series.

In the fifteen years I've been running above/ground press, producing
chapbooks, magazines and 'poem' leaflets, I was amazed at what I could
potentially accomplish, given that, thanks to the University and my new
income, with actual resources. How could I not be producing material out
of my English and Film Studies office?

Actually, the image used  is "owned' by AP--so the artist is suddenly being
arrested on ancient warrents-Of course, before there was the Obama "Hope"--
there was "The Man from Hope"--
Big Bill Clinton--
wonder if Mr Big Mouth will step in and become a "mediator"--!
but then who knew that maybe Hope itself is belonging to one of the Wall
street Crooks now installed in charge of the Treasury and next to the
President himself--
perhaps with these greedheads around, it has suddenly become neccesary to
"collect" on the debts Mr Graffitti owes?--
i am sure some of Bubba's Big boys along with him and Rahm baby can go make
sure "the matter is settled"--
AP and the US Govt vs.  mr Artist!
let the "Change" begin!!

  WASHINGTON (AFP) =96 The artist who created the iconic pop-art portrait
which became the unofficial logo for Barack Obama's insurgent White
Housebid, has been arrested in
Boston for defacing property with graffiti, US media reported.

Artist Shepard Fairey was arrested in Boston late Friday on warrants for
defacing property with graffiti, the Boston Herald and other media outlets
reported.

He is the creator of a popular red, white and blue poster, emblazoned with
the legend "hope" "progress" or "change," showing the then-presidential
candidate gazing off into the distance.

Fairey, 38, was taken into custody on his way to Boston's Institute of
Contemporary Art where he was being honored with a solo exhibition of his
work, called "Supply and Demand."

The street artist and political activist first became well known for his
"Obey Giant" campaign of stickers, stencils, and posters of the early 1990s=
.

The Herald reported that two warrants were issued for Fairey last month
after police said he tagged property in two locations with graffiti.

He is to be arraigned Monday on the misdemeanor charges, authorities told
the newspaper.

"*Fairey's arresting image*" of Obama has been *sold on hundreds of
thousands of stickers and posters, and now hangs in Washington at the Natio=
nal
Portrait Gallery.*

The artist is also embroiled in a copyright dispute with The Associated
Press over his use without credit or remuneration of the photo upon which
the now-famous graphic-design image of Obama was based.

(Apparently the author of this article is looking for some answers...)

Where are today's farmer poets?

Farming has changed beyond all recognition since the days of 'poets of
the land' Robert Burns and John Clare

http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/feb/05/farmer-poets-rober
t-burns

The recent Burns night celebrations reminded me that Scotland's most
famous son was actually a farmer who wrote his best work at night in
his but'n'ben after a day's hard toil in the soil.

Burns wasn't the first agriculturist to put pen to paper, but he did
set a standard in poetry for self-taught writers describing the
landscape from an embedded perspective. There's a great distinction
between these poets, who, because their survival depends on it, have a
far more intimate relationship with the land, and those who describe
it while looking at it from their firesides on the other side of the
window. Chief among the latter are the (largely classically educated)
Romantics, who, though drawing inspiration from the landscape,
romanticised it in a way a farmer never would. (Wordsworth at least
had the gumption to recognise this gulf between romance and reality in
The Leech-Gatherer).

Of the former, perhaps the best-known example after Burns is John
Clare, a farm-labourer by profession who, though patronised at various
points in his life, had no choice but to keep returning to work the
land. Clare's work, though celebrated for displaying an understanding
of the metaphysical on a par with his more acclaimed academic
contemporaries, captured the small details of farming life with a lack
of sentimentality that would have been impossible had he spent his
formative years at, say, Eton, rather than in the Northamptonshire
fields. (Ironically, Clare found it hard to commune with many of his
farming neighbours, who viewed him with suspicion, writing "they
hardly dare talk in my company for fear I should mention them in my
writings and I find more pleasure in wandering the fields than in
musing among my silent neighbours who are insensible to everything but
toiling and talking of it".)

Another fine example of a body of nature poetry that could only have
been written by a man of the land is that of Patrick Kavanagh, who
spent 20 years living the farming life - a life which informed his
1936 debut The Ploughman and Other Poems and indeed his more famous
later works, The Great Hunger and his novel Tarry Flynn (and which
later, incidentally, led Brendan Behan to dismiss him as a backwoods
yokel).

Such writers were a far cry from the world of academia and the
literary high society - closed-off worlds to most cow-milking,
kale-growing, dung-shovelling poets of yesteryear (though more
recently Seamus Heaney, whose father was a farmer and cattle-dealer,
has made the leap).

All of which begs the question: who are the true British poets of the
land today? Well, I don't actually know, but was hoping you might be
able to tell me. With farming changed beyond all recognition since the
crofting days of Robert Burns, is the best emerging
agricultural-inspired poetry more likely to come from small-holdings
and organic farms and the emerging conservation and ecology movements?
Does the new poetry reflect our changing understanding of farming and
the land around us? I'd welcome any recommendations.

Poets, you are eager

Young poets, you are so eager
To call the language
That comes after language
That of false children.
Maybe we are not so much false children
As we are conduits of the truth.
The death of the author never meant
The landscaped moon-earth you inhabit
Alongside the strange animals you let in there.
The real life is wild and the animals will bite you.
It is not so much moonless as the moon is seen nowhere
And always felt.
It is no matter, however
As you are just about to eat the fire you speak.

NEW PROJECTIVE INDUSTRIES CHAPBOOK

Another Limit by Linnea Ogden

In "Another Limit," Linnea Ogden maps a skeptic's fugitive geography
of the imagination.  In poems with titles like "Submerged Lands Act,"
this poet continuously draws and redraws the jurisdiction of her
literary consciousness, always seeking "the answer to this particular
border / dispute" in poems of considerable formal grace and emotional
honesty.

-Srikanth Reddy

Linnea Ogden explores boundaries both thematically and in her syntax.
But most amazing: she makes legal language sing.

Obododimma & others:

What kind of farming do you do & do you feel like there is an
interface between your farming life & your writing life?

I've been running a permaculture demonstration for almost 20 years, on
a yearly basis we have folks coming thru here interning & learning how
to grow food for themselves, put it up, learn to cook local & be
resourceful in ways that don't require the big bucks.  We grow
primarily fruits nuts garden annuals gourds & other craftables as well
as a lot of exotics like container figs & citrus.  I also make my
living from largest organic farmers cooperative in the US...(but as a
webmaster).  For my part the interface is sometimes very sketchy altho
in some ways the visual poetry that I've done has come much closer to
reinventing the wild space of language.

Currently combining, but perfectly under control, we're building the
concept of an 11:30 after-hours reading in Chicargo, the city of
shoulders.  Watch for it at AWP.  For those interested in Ahadada,
published by Ahadada, soon-to-be published by Ahadada and ditto for
BlazeVox!  Friends, countrypersons, foes foettes and general foistas,
come with your plaudits or come with your shoes in hand.  But come!
Details will be awaiting you at AWP.  Seek us out at the Ahadada/
BlazeVox table on Wednesday.

**And the Rest of Our Poetry section**
    (excerpts below)

=97Prospect Heights, Brooklyn's Kate Broad with Girlfish

In the motel mirror on the ceiling
starfish arms radiate yellowed and dead.
Sad mutant fish! Everyone touches you.
Your tubes wriggle obligingly
in mirrors and museums.


=97Boston's Elisa Gabbert with Poem With a Mind Game

This room has no focal point,
no TV. I feel like I love you.

Or I love you, verbatim.
My heart hurts exactly.


=97Ditmas Park, Brooklyn's Paige Taggart with
               ligaments inside the light room arched up

Once the premier standalone fanzine about the AntiFolk scene, Urban =20
Folk, under the helm of its editor, longtime Boog City Music Editor =20
Jonathan Berger, becomes a pullout in each Boog City with this issue.

=97With reviews of new releases from Benji Cossa, Club Mate, Creaky =20
Boards, Tamara Hey, Frank Hoier, M. Lamar, and Schwervon's "Balloon" =20
video

Featuring:

=93Tamara Hey=92s unassuming and polite, and you can=92t tell that she=92s=
 one =20
of the best songwriters in town. Her work is excellent; with memorable =20=

melodies and literate lyrics that stay with the listener long after an =20=

arrangements influenced by husband Henry Hey.=94 =97from Hey! Listen to =20=

--------
Four reviews from Justin Remer:
=93What gets lost in all this hullabaloo about plagiarism charges is =20
Creaky Boards=92 music. The Boards sound virtually nothing like =20
Coldplay. And what about the rest of the album? Oh right, that. Yeah, =20=

um, it=92s good.=94 =97from Living the Life on a Noisy Floor; Brooklyn =

http://www.myspace.com/creakyboards

=93Neil Kelly of the noise-jam band Huggabroomstik, using the name Club =20=

Mate, has taken 19 songs from the three albums by New York singer-=20
songwriter Thomas Patrick Maguire, plus an as-yet-released song, and =20
remade them in eclectic ways. Maguire=92s songs are taken out of the =20
realm of nineties style alterna-folk and repurposed as reggae (=91Now =20=

That Things Are Not So Well=92), drugged-out space rock (=91Hospital=92), =
=20

http://www.myspace.com/clubmatemusic

=93Brooklyn (via Southern California) singer-songwriter Frank Hoier has =20=

just finished a full-band rock album that sounds much less like the =20
dreary pop or emo of today and more like something you=92d find in a =20
used record shop, shelved appropriately between copies of The Band=92s =20=

And three more from Berger:
=93Benji Cossa is some kind of sick musical savant. Each song on his 19-=20=

ranging from white boy soul in =91Good Times=92 to the =9260s garage =

=93Ben Sadock=92s debut release opens with an exciting one-two punch. =
The =20
first song tells us that =91You and me, and Mister T pity the fool,=92 =20=

thus introducing the clever wordplay and logistical language that will =20=

follow. Soon after, Sadock runs off with the following lines: =91Turn =20=

around and then you=92ll find it=92s cool to be cruel, but it=92s cruel =
to =20
be kind, and I kind of like being kind of cool =85=92 The references! =

rolling of words and rhythms! The regular alteration of repetition! =20

this is just to alert you all that the
8th Big CLWN WR Event
will take place on Thursday, February 19, at the SAFE-T-GALLERY at 111 Front St., Gallery 214, in the DUMBO section of Brooklyn (the directions follow below) - admission as always is free - it will start around 7:00 and go 'til around 10:00 with poetry and music and dance
 - - the two featured readers will be CRAIG CZURY, travelling in from Reading, PA for a rare New York appearance, and the amazingly talented R. NEMO HILL
- - special guests will include Craig Fishbane, Mindy Levokove, Katrinka Moore, Carolyn Ota, Adriana Scopino, Moira T. Smith and Nathan Whiting
- - CLWN WR (formerly Clown War) was founded in 1971 by Bob Heman (that's me - i'll be hosting) and Stephen Fairhurst - it continues to publish ephemeral editions in several formats - two new "letter" issues (and probably a new small poem issue) will debut at the reading and will be given free to all who attend - we continue to invite small poems no larger than 20 words
- - to reach SAFE-T-GALLERY take the F train to York Street, walk downhill to Front St. and turn left under the Manhattan Bridge - for more information, maps, and directions from other subway lines go to http://www.safetgallery.com
hope to see you all there
- Bob

We, the editor of CANNOT EXIST magazine, are pleased to announce the appearance of the fourth issue. We feel that too many poets and readers have given up on having their minds blown these days, and as an antidote to such resignation have assembled a grand collection of mind-blowing writings by:

Christophe Casamassima
Mark DeCarteret
Thom Donovan
Raymond Farr
Andy Frazee
Jeff Glassman
Nicholas Grider
Robert V. Hale
Carrie Hunter
Jennifer Karmin
Eileen Myles
Steven Salmoni
and
Rodrigo Toscano

Also, each copy of CANNOT EXIST no.4 features a unique cover by one of many contributing artists. That's right, 125 unique covers, all wonderful, many digital reproductions and a handful of precious originals.

You can get it through http://cannotexist.blogspot.com.

For a generous paean to the magazine by Thom Donovan (written for the issue's launch in the SEGUE series), go to http://whof.blogspot.com/2009/02/cannot-exist-4-launch-segue-series.html

Hope all's well with you all!

--Andy G.

P.S. Submissions to the magazine are currently closed. It'll be a couple of months at the least.

Hi All -=20
Yes, I have persisted in this crazy project, a "haptic"=A0 a day plus comme=
ntary (which varies from accounts of the public geist=A0 - what is happenin=
g in 'our' media and public spaces to poetry readings and related events. O=
f course, much of the time, it is done with,=A0 at least, an oblique eye on=
 the big (tall) O and the emerging impact & changes of this new regime!=20

Poets in the 'public mix' may take interest in the February 7 entry where I=
 give account of Jules Boykoff and Kaia Sands "Nonsite" presentation on Gue=
rrilla poetries as forms of public - text & visual - intervention. (Think S=
usan Schultz. etc.)

You can actually start on Inauguration day and scroll through the blog. You=
r remarks are always, well, mostly=A0 appreciated!=20

Meantimee, if you are in the Bay Area, "Haptics" my show at the Braunstein-=
Quay Gallery remains up through Februaary 20, complete with a pink Champagn=
e walk through on Valentines Day, Saturdary afternoon, 2 - 4.=A0 430 Clemen=

Quincy Jones has started a petition to ask President Obama to appoint a
Secretary of the Arts. While many other countries have had Ministers
of Art or Culture for centuries, The United States has never created
such a position. Those in the arts need this and the country need the
arts--now more than ever. Please take a moment to sign
this important petition and then pass it on to your friends and colleagues.

Quincy Jones has started a petition to ask President Obama to appoint a Secretary of the Arts. While many other countries have had Ministers of Art or Culture for centuries, The United States has never created such a position. Those in the arts need this and the country need the arts--now more than ever. Please take a moment to sign this important petition and then pass it on to your friends and colleagues.

Hi mIEKAL,Thanks. I do crop farming, producing mainly vegetables such as
onion, fluted pumpkin (we eat the leaves over here in Nigeria), okra, etc. I
also have great interest in cultivating yams. Yam is regarded as a special
crop in the Igbo culture. But apart from this, I like seeing the tender
shoots emerge and climb the stakes. Yams are climbers, strategic climbers.
The yellow yam prefers to climb the stake clockwise, whereas the white yam
prefers doing its own anticlockwise. Even if you change the directions for
these yams, they undo your imposition some hours later. This pattern of
movement and peculiar phototropism, engage my interest a lot.

On interface between my farming life and writing life: I talk to my crops
and do often imagine that my interaction with them renews my life, keeps me
"green." Perhaps it is a hunger, perhaps. But whenever I emerge from my
farm, I feel a great mental energy to want to write.

For three days now, I have been sharing my time between sowing ideas through
writing and sowing seeds in the garden behind my place of residence. I see
the seeds of ideas and the seeds of the vegetables and root crops
germinating and growing as if the destinies of both are tied together.
Perhaps as I practice both, I realize the need to nurture ideas creatively,
even in unfriendly seasons and in unfriendly spaces. In fact, mIEKAL, I
can't stop working on both farms....

Hello again Poeticists,

If you would like to review 'Solicitations' (see info below)
Please contact me on the backchannel
p.brown62@gmail.com

Thanks,
Pam Brown


Litteraria Pragensia is pleased to announce the recent publication of:

SOLICITATIONS: Essays on Criticism & Culture

by Louis Armand

ISBN 80-7308-242-0 (paperback) 515pp, incl. index.

Publication date: December 2008


http://litteraria.ff.cuni.cz/books/solicitations2.html

Commencing with an analysis of the rhetoric of "crisis," Armand poses
questions of central concern to the future of criticism and the
institutions of knowledge. Focusing upon the role of technology in
re-shaping the structures of human experience, language and cultural
practice, this collection of essays offers a broad critique of the
legacies of modernity and beyond.

Louis Armand is director of the Centre for Critical & Cultural Theory
in the Philosophy Faculty of Charles University, Prague. His books
include Incendiary Devices: Discourses of the Other (2006); Literate
Technologies (2006) and Event-States (2007).

That's it, David. Sometimes the colours and shapes in the garden enact a
pattern of reality beyond words. And I find the visual poem more urgent,
more practical. There are colours of the flowers and leaves of the crops
that say many things. I find myself just staring and trying to take it all
in. Touring the garden as soon as I get back home from the office, or from
any other place that fills my head with noise, has become more than a
therapy for me.
I like many things that thrill and renew the mind, David, including very
crazy things like leaving my room at night (indeed, sneaking out) and going
to the garden to sit and think in the darkness and listen to the night
sounds... and the lights of the fireflies.

I also like escaping from "book" people once in a while and going deep into
the village to be with the country folk, to share in their lore and life. I
think I belong to them, only that I hold the pen on the one hand and a hoe
on the other....

--- Obododimma.

The Program in Literature is proud to present

"Poetry and Code: An Interactive Digital Reading"

A lecture by Stephanie Strickland

February 19, 2009
4:30pm
In the Upper East Side in the East Union Building
East Campus

Stephanie Strickland's book of poems, Zone : Zero (book + CD), will be
available for purchase at her lecture!

Stephanie Strickland will read from four digital poems she wrote and
made collaboratively, each of which uses the screen in a different way
to offer non-print reading experiences. Hypertext, Flash, Director, and
motion tracking coding are used in the design of these poems.
Strickland will also discuss the implications of her various interfaces.

Stephanie Strickland's fifth book of poems, Zone : Zero (book + CD), was
just published by Ahsahta Press. Her prize-winning poetry volumes
include V: WaveSon.nets / Losing L'una (Penguin), True North (University
of Notre Dame Press), and The Red Virgin:  A Poem of Simone Weil
(University of Wisconsin Press). Her latest collaborative hypermedia
work, slippingglimpse, was introduced in Paris and shown at the Zaoem
poetry festival in Ghent. She teaches experimental poetry and e-lit at
many colleges and universities, most recently the University of Utah.

This event is free and open to the public.

I agree-- an art czar (ours or theirs)
would iron art into the ground.

Haven't we witnessed the handiwork
of well-intentioned, but miss-nuanced
Lariats have wrought?

Q of all people should realize what
would happen to free jazz when the
iron-clad others take power again
some day... as, sadly, they prob. will.

Now, a Sec. of Anarchy....

Troy,

I'm even more confused after reading that, since you didn't say much but "if
we allow this to happen, the arts will be ruined. muah ha ha."

Aside from noting that there will always be "official" (read, hotel lobby)
art and "unofficial" art, how will appointing a Secretary of the Arts (add
your name suggestion here) change anything?

Can anyone think of any long poems or plays on (or in) prison/
imprisonment. I'm not even going to prime the pump, as I want to cast
a wide net. Looking into doing a theater piece at a defunct prison
and want to catalogue and read what's out there.

thanks all,

If anyone needs last minute lodging, I'm writing to recommend a B&B run by =
a friend of Michael Stephens in Evanston, just minutes from the AWP confere=
nce in Chicago. If interested phone Susan Wolan at 773-331-6578. She can gi=

of Evanston, a few blocks from the lake and a short walk downtown. Main Str=
eet is a minute away. The two trains -- the Metra and the el -- are five-mi=
nutes' walk. The Metra takes you to downtown Chicago in eighteen minutes. S=
he can provide you with the rest of the information.

You're right.
That right-wing view should also encompass those other areas of life.
No more cabinet ministers for the military, foreign affairs, the
treasury, any of that stuff.
Turn them all over to the "Free" Enterprise people,
you know--the anti-socialists who are being bailed out now.

Please excuse cross postings but not our delirium at this amazing
upcoming reading!


What would the Iliad look like if rewritten using only one vowel? What
happens to political poetry when channeled through the waste of
corporate language and search engines? On February 20, Small Press
Traffic presents Christian B=F6k and Rachel Zolf, two celebrated members
of the Canadian avant-garde, who will read from their landmark,
award-winning books.

Christian B=F6k's Eunoia was an instant bestseller in the U.K., where it
was just released in the fall of 2008. First published in Canada in
2001, Eunoia is a univocal lipogram (using only one vowel per
chapter), which achieves its full impact when performed live by B=F6k.
Charles Bernstein has called it 'an exemplary monument for 21st
century poetry.' B=F6k will be reading from the Griffin Prize-winning
Eunoia, among other recent works.

Rachel Zolf's Human Resources is a writing machine in which poetry and
'plain language' collide. At the intersection of creation and
repackaging, we experience the visceral and psychic cost of selling
things with depleted words. Pilfered rhetorics fed into the machine
are spit out as bungled associations among money, refuse, culture,
work and communication. With the help of online engines that
numericize language, Human Resources explores writing as a process of
encryption. Zolf will read from Human Resources and her current
work-in-progress on competing knowledges in Israel-Palestine, The
Neighbour Procedure.

Small Press Traffic Presents Christian B=F6k and Rachel Zolf
Friday, February 20, 7:30 p.m.

One of the fundamentals of gardening / growing / writing / publishing
I think most about is sustainability, how to foster diverse ecologies
that will support unlimited edges, overloading the system in an almost
chaotic fashion, yet in the end turns out to be one model of
abundance.  One that looks a lot different than the uninterrupted
miles of corn fields in the great plains states or monotypic poetry
being published by mainstream media.

& as for yams,  I'm in a place that gets 40 below 0 (C or F, take your
pick) but I manage to grow dioscorea batatas in the forest garden...

I must respond to this kind of hysteria that ultimately prevents us from making the arts what they should and could be, that is a reflection of what is happening in our society (since we cannot trust the media to convey anything reflectively nor honestly) and an example of what can occur when the human spirit is allowed to make itself manifest. So many artists cannot BE ARTISTS because there is simply no support. I am sure that the office could be developed in such a way that we would be able to address any violations to free expression and with careful selection/ screening of a Secretary (as we try to do whenever any other Secretary if nominated) we could have a then have a thriving artistic community. Certainly with all the cuts to arts education, we cannot expect to have a group of young people less appreciative of what the arts might do for their lives, not the least of which is development of the imagination. Perhaps this cultivation of the imagination might just save us

>Quincy Jones has started a petition to ask President Obama to appoint a Secretary of the Arts. While many other countries have had Ministers of Art or Culture for centuries, The United States has never created such a position. Those in the arts need this and the country need the arts--now more than ever. Please take a moment to sign this important petition and then pass it on to your friends and colleagues.

CRG Open Video Series
UbuWeb: Film & Video: FLASH ARTIFACTS <http://www.crggallery.com/events/>
<http://www.crggallery.com/events/>
Curated by Jo=E3o Enxuto and Danny Snelson

THURSDAY FEBRUARY 19TH - 7PM

Excited to announce an upcoming two panel screening (Feb 19, 7PM=97that's n=
ext
Thursday) at CRG Gallery in New York. You can find the full info on the
event, along with directions, at the CRG event
site<http://www.crggallery.com/events/>
.

I'm working as UbuWeb's representative along with curator Jo=E3o Enxuto. We=
'll
be screening some of the more remarkable incidents of digital prescience
we've found in the films streaming at UbuWeb. See blurb
info<http://www.crggallery.com/events/>,
below, or at the screenings previous incarnation at D21 in
Leipzig<http://www.d21-leipzig.de/ubu+web+english>
.

Also! Those in the New York, I'll be reading at the Poetry
Project<http://www.poetryproject.com/calendar.php>this Monday (Feb 16,
8PM) with Lance
Wakeling <http://www.ubu.com/contemp/wakeling/index.html>, wch also promise=
s
to excite.

Hope to see you,
Danny

[PS. If anyone outside of the New York area wld like videos for these
performances please backchannel me &I'll be happy to send you a link. Will
have much of this up at my site <http://aphasic-letters.com/> sometime.]

: :

Curators Jo=E3o Enxuto and Danny Snelson will organize selections from the
streaming video archives of the ubu.com/film
<http://www.ubuweb.com/film> website
as a means to momentarily "clothe and house" classic avant-garde film and
video works. This performance will investigate the characteristics of onlin=
e
versions of media-reflexive works. Through live projections and
interventions, the curators will reprogram works designed to address medium=
s
now teetering at the edge of obsolescence.

New possibilities will be explored for historical material freed from the
properties of celluloid or television. Streaming online, Paul Sharits' film
"Dots 1 & 2" is transformed into a matrix of pixel-squares.  And Vito
Acconci presages the promise of social networking in "Theme Song": *There's
got to be somebody.  There's got to be somebody watching me, somebody who
wants to come in close to me. *
Founded in 1996, UbuWeb is an idiosyncratic archive of previously scarce
avant-garde films and video artifacts.  Editors and curators determine the
content of UbuWeb, which is one source among many that have "become subsume=
d
in the mechanics of digital redistribution."  Dada films, Structuralist
cinema, and early video experiments are all subject to the compressed
regimen of flash video formats. This live screening is a cinematic event: a=
n
orchestrated celebration of the dereliction affecting these historical
objects, reconfigured now under the logic of digital distribution.

Subject:      RIP Keith Wilson (1927-2009)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Keith Wilson died the other day. He was a friend I've known since the
mid-60s,
when I spent some years living in El Paso while he was living in southern
New
Mexico: Anthony, right on the Texas-New Mexico border; then San Miguel,
farther
north, up the Mesilla Valley of the Rio Grande; and then Las Cruces. Any
house
of Keith and Heloise Wilson was full of music and wine and poetry, a
caravanserai
for poets traveling north or south, east or west.

Keith, at one stage of his life, often wrote of the sea, and his sea poems
were
among the best poems to come out of the Korean War. Here's one that's not
overtly war related:

The Sea

"On the beach
the ocean ends in water.
     --George Oppen
     *The Materials*

The crisp line, taut, in all
intimations, thrown out, cork circling
the water, spash, my hand

reaching out

--the call, rightly named, these
*Materials*, the call is there
simple, demanding

response and a certain
attention to pulse, the
movement of whatever the work

asks of man--is that what
I'm trying to say, a man,
and how, sometimes, he doesn't

drown. Coming up spitting
salt water, safely past the
screws, it *is* a man
intact who waves

from the calm wake; behind
him the sea clear, oceans
held in place by a line.


And he wrote of dusty New Mexico
towns:

The Politicians

                         come
come here with full bellies
& shined shoes to the one street
of San Miguel, talking, waving
hands, their harsh gringo Spanish
shouted in the hanging dust
of the square

     the men of the town
stand uneasy, aware of their hard
hands, the blue of the stranger's
eyes, their own mudcrusted boots
stiff with clay

they are ashamed these men
whose hands are strong with work & loving.
they listen. then go to the bar,
beer & red wine, juke box Infante songs,
his dead voice singing of a Mexico
which was sad, beautiful, but theirs
--riding free across a green land,
*gritos* on their lips & dead politicians
fall, one-by-one before their dreaming guns.

--both from *Graves Registry and Other Poems*
[New York: Grove Press, 1969]

Coincidentally, while 1969 did not mark the first publication of a
collection of
poems by Keith Wilson, it did mark the first publication of a collection of
poems
by me. And it was Keith Wilson who sat me down on his living room floor and
showed me how to put a collection of poems together. That first book that
bore
a epigraph by Keith Wilson: "a sunlit unity / desperately sought" and
contained
this poem written on the occasion of Keith's and Heloise's moving from
Anthony,
New Mexico, to a big new (well, not new new) house in San Miguel:

Moving Out

for Keith & Heloise Wilson

    saying goodbye
    is no trouble:

    a house is a skin
    to be shucked

    wriggled out of
    room by room

    closet by closet
    until what remains

    is piles of boxes,
    a few empty hangers,

    a heap of debris
    on the kitchen floor

    which never seemed so wide,
    a neighbor's dog

    who come to say goodbye
    from a respectable distance.

fr. *Transparencies and Projections*
[New York: New Rivers Press, 1969]

Beam Me Up video from performance 2/11

(Below is a general description which I've prepared for an online class
coming up.)

I have an installation in the online virtual world, Second Life. If you go
http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 - you will find it. In order
to use this URL, you need to have a Second Life account; you can get this
at http://www.secondlife.com . The installation is called The Accidental
Artist and is quite complex - I've been changing it for the past eight
months. You can find all sorts of images and videos from it at
http://www.alansondheim.org/ - these include a number of performances that
have been seen and recorded world-wide. (The last was February 11.)

Let me begin with silent film. Roberta E. Pearson, in Eloquent Gestures:
The Transformations of Performance Style in Griffith Biograph Films,
distinguishes between two fundamental modes of performance: the histrionic
and the verisimilar. I associate the former with melodrama and the latter
with a presumed 'natural' acting style. Melodrama operates through a
semiotics of stereotyped poses and movements (hands clasped in prayer for
example); traditionally, theatrical poses might be held for a few seconds
- forming a tableau (waiting for audience reaction). You can see this mode
in operation in silent films; characters will _stop_ and hold exaggerated
gestures, as the diegesis is transformed into a meta-narrative of segmen-
ted moments. I claim that this semiotics (which also extends into and
through subtitles) plays out in virtual worlds as well, since characters
are given stock responses (animations) which may be played one after
another, in serial order - at times there may be 'behavior collisions' -
situations in which animations compete with each other.

In my virtual world (Second Life) work, I use files that have been
produced by altered motion capture equipment. A human performer, wearing
sensors, moves in a regulated environment, and the movements of the
sensors are recorded - this results in a file that allows an avatar to
mimic the movement of the human. In my work, however, there are two
differences: the sensors are remapped onto the body in a 'non-natural'
manner (head on foot for example), and the software itself is rewritten in
order to create what I call 'dynamic filters' - the original human move-
ment is filtered to produce new and inconceivable movement. This is the
sources of a great deal of my work, which starts from a 'natural' order
and proceeds into a distorted digital/virtual one - which may then be
returned (through live dance for example) in another altered form to the
'real' world. I see my avatars having the potential frenzy/energy of
silent film and the wild movement of Buster Keaton.

(In the excerpts above, the avatar movement is slowed down in grotesque duets
with Sandy Baldwin; I did little recording of the high-speed movement since I
was working the environment at the time.)

Not direct hits, but check out the poetry of Etheridge Knight, and the
memoir A Place to Stand by Jimmy Santiago Baca. Neither play nor long poem
per se, but certainly literary and informed prison experience. Excerpts of
the Baca book could work as monologues.

Perhaps my favorite is Alan Davies a an  av
es<http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/AVES/aves.html>(published
by Potes & Poets in 1981, now hosted by Eclipse) which uses the
'prisoner constraint'=97namely, no ascenders or danglers. Imagine: if you
wanted to jam as many words as possible into a finite piece of paper from y=
r
jail cell, you might be compelled to seek an extreme economy of height.

After that, de Sade?

Nothing not obvious, perhaps, but CD Wright's One Big Self and, though nove=
ls, Jean Genet's Our Lady of the Flowers and  Miracle of the Rose come imme=
diately to mind, and Wright's book includes a list of prison-related readin=

Not direct hits, but check out the poetry of Etheridge Knight, and the
memoir A Place to Stand by Jimmy Santiago Baca. Neither play nor long poem
per se, but certainly literary and informed prison experience. Excerpts of
the Baca book could work as monologues.

Obododimma, Greetings!

I have numerous Nigerian students in my French classes here in south
Georgia, along with other west Africans, Cameroun etc. But my
students tend to be city dwellers, some don't even know what their
ethnic heritage is. ("Urbain," they confess.) I Have made some short
visits to west Africa, longer ones to east Africa, and I lived for a
year in Morocco. I have translated the Moroccan poet Serhane.

My south Georgia garden has fruit trees (apple, pear, almond, even
olives). For vegetables, I do all right with tomatoes and eggplants,
but have less success with onions and squash. My herbs are super:
rosemary, lavendar, sage, thyme.

I write poems about land and plants, and do lots of visual poetry. My
Georgics poetry books about Cotton and Tobacco have been critical
successes.

Voila, c'est moi.

David

Military and foreign affairs are things allowed by the Constitution and within the proper purview of government. I would get rid of the Sec. of Treasury, Sec. of Education, Sec. of Labor, Sec. of Commerce, Sec. of Transportation, Sec. of Housing and Urban Dev., Sec. of the Interior, Sec. of Agriculture, Sec. of Energy, and, of course, as mentioned, Sec. of Education.

I also would not have bailed out any companies, as that is not the job of government, either. Had the government not interfered in the market in the first place, we wouldn't have had this particular crisis, and if they had just let those who made the mistakes they did fail rather than rewarding them for having failed, the recession would be over by now. The economy is already showing signs of recovery -- but don't worry, this "bailout" bill just passed will squash that.

My political ideology, btw, is not Right-wing. And supporting free markets, a naturally-occurring, self-organizing system, is not ideological at all -- it's like saying I support the existence of deserts on the 30th parallel. Opposing deserts being on the 30th parallel is ideological.

You're right.
That right-wing view should also encompass those other areas of life.
No more cabinet ministers for the military, foreign affairs, the treasury, any of that stuff.
Turn them all over to the "Free" Enterprise people,

You want the same people cutting arts education in our schools to be in charge of the arts?

I have never met a true artist who couldn't be an artist due to lack of support. All tons of government support will do is make it so that people who don't want to do anything can play at making art, reducing the quality and reputation of art and artists. Further, I really do not think you want to democratize the arts. Do you want a committee deciding if what you do is art? Do you really want your work put up to a vote? Subject to political pressures? This is the reality of something like this.

I must respond to this kind of hysteria that ultimately prevents us from making the arts what they should and could be, that is a reflection of what is happening in our society (since we cannot trust the media to convey anything reflectively nor honestly) and an example of what can occur when the human spirit is allowed to make itself manifest. So many artists cannot BE ARTISTS because there is simply no support. I am sure that the office could be developed in such a way that we would be able to address any violations to free expression and with careful selection/ screening of a Secretary (as we try to do whenever any other Secretary if nominated) we could have a then have a thriving artistic community. Certainly with all the cuts to arts education, we cannot expect to have a group of young people less appreciative of what the arts might do for their lives, not the least of which is development of the imagination. Perhaps this cultivation of the
 imagination might just save us

I don't care who is appointed this time or that time. I just fear that a Secretary of the Arts will do for the arts what the Secretary of Education did for education. The more the federal government has gotten involved in education in the U.S., the worse it has gotten. There is also the fact that the more government funds something, the less private funds become available for that same things. The arts will become increasingly government controlled. Maybe you and others want that, but I certainly do not. It may seem a dream scenario to you because of who is in the WHite House right now, but what if someone is elected who could turn it into a nightmare scenario? The thought of who a President Pat Buchanan or his like would appoint to such a position terrifies me. I don't know why it doesn't terrify you.

Troy,

I'm even more confused after reading that, since you didn't say much but "if
we allow this to happen, the arts will be ruined. muah ha ha."

Aside from noting that there will always be "official" (read, hotel lobby)
art and "unofficial" art, how will appointing a Secretary of the Arts (add
your name suggestion here) change anything?

Yes, I am conscious of overloading and try to avoid it. I also try to
achieve some order in terms of where I plant what, so that I would have a
farm that cuts the picture of an artwork. It doesn't quite work out all the
time. One reason is that I wrestle with erosion and have to change the
design of the ridges and mounds. Moreover, my two sons, in their own
practice, use part of the space, locating their "farm-arts" within mine.
Something much like one text inhabiting another. I like it though, for it
gives me an impression that we are all texts interacting and re/producing
meanings. I took some pictures of the mini farm designed by my last-born, a
boy of 9+, who has been doing some writing too. In his own case, he designs
the whole manuscript as the finished book, from cover to cover, drawing
images here and there, writing stories. He now has five of such
hand-designed manuscripts.
Regards.
Obododimma.

My work goes into the blend of art and nature. I am trying to make
garden sites that evoke images in Baudelaire's sonnet of the
Correspondences. My lettriste colleague Alain Satie trained a
wisteria vine into word shapes....I work more at the level of trees
and shrubs, shaping them. Like Asian gardeners, I think we are
invited to make poetry of our plantings.

One thing I have noticed in the back-and-forth over the stimulus plan is
that the NEA seems to be specifically singled out as an unworthy recipient
of stimulus money. From radio ads sponsored by the Republican House campaign
committee :

"Democrats said they would fight for fiscal responsibility in Washington,
> but went back on their promise by voting for $335 million in STD prevention,
> $75 million for smoking cessation and *even $50 million for the National
> Endowment of the Arts,*" the National Republican Congressional Committee
> said in announcing the ad buys.


 It's as if giving money to the NEA would just be pissing it away. The
hypocrisy is blatant. Small arts organizations are often small businesses,
and republicans have been touting small businesses as the key to stimulus.

It would be nice to have a spokesman--in whatever capacity--to effectively
respond to this sanctioned buffoonery.

Free markets are NOT naturally occurring. To establish free markets,
tariffs, monopolies, slavery, theft and mismanagement were involved. NONE of
these things is natural.

Dillon,

C. D. Wright and Deborah Luster's poetic-photographic collaboration,
One Big Self: Prisoners in Louisiana (Twin Palms), raises interesting
questions about invisibility and spectacle, intimacy and
impersonality, and the social function of art.  It also has an
extensive bibliography of prison-related writings in the back pages.
The poem (I prefer to think of it as such, rather than as a sequence
of poems) has been reprinted by Copper Canyon as One Big Self: An
Investigation, but I can't say whether or not that edition also
contains that bibliography.  The original version with all the
photographs is out of print but still available from Twin Palms for
the eye-opening price of $150, but in my estimation it's worth every
cent...

It's a novel (I know, I know), but Darkness at Noon should definitely not be
forgotten.

good grief, what's a "true artist" and what does it mean to "be an
artist"? I'm sorry, this is ridiculous. "people who don't want to anything
can play at making art"? Have you ever really been involved with the grant
system? You think money goes to people who are "playing"?

this country gives less per capita than any industrialized country to the
arts. what really gets me infuriated about this is the number of artists I
know who can't afford health care or decent housing because of lack of
support.

this is insulting.

on any other list this would be a troll.

So many artists cannot BE ARTISTS because there is simply no support. I am sure that the office could be developed in such a way that we would be able to address any violations to free expression and with careful selection/ screening of a Secretary (as we try to do whenever any other Secretary if nominated) we could have a then have a thriving artistic community. Certainly with all the cuts to arts education, we cannot expect to have a group of young people less appreciative of what the arts might do for their lives, not the least of which is development of the imagination.

It's really hard to read these posts and not be tempted to outright
provocation, but this is a list about poetry and poetics so I will try to
stay on topic.
You say:

>

Well, I've never met anybody from Djibouti...

but I have read many books that may not exist without governmental support.
I'm thinking specifically of Roof Books (although I'm sure there are many
other fine organizations) which has thrived with support from the NEA and
other organizations I've never heard of.

But I really can't help myself:

Troy, my man, you really put yourself out there when you post on this list.

And supporting free markets, a naturally-occurring, self-organizing system,
> is not ideological at all


I hate to break this to you, but markets were invented by humans. They don't
occur naturally, and we organize them in absolutely every sense of the
word.

In the mid 1950's there was a kind of fad for producing Waiting for Godot i=
nside various US prisons. =20

What might be more interesting is to take something "on the outside" that i=

 reveal this "liberating" piece as instead but another form of imprisonment=
=2C another from of control=2C another form of surveillance=2C another meth=
od for creating conformity as wel as for turning out new forms of criminali=
ties . . .=20

For example=2C why not just use this setting like a Poetics Class Room--and=
 examine the uses of language in "Poetics" and "Avant" or "Innovative" writ=
ing in terms of "Discipline and Punish."

How much of the Classroom imprisons the mind=2C how much of Poetics prevent=

To be ALLOWED--is this not already within the realm of the prison system--

One could choose various long works of such writing and subject them to "in=

Or one might begin to consider other scenarios for reading the Guantanamo P=
oems--across the receptions they received from American poets--
perhaps to find that it is the American poets who are imprisoned by what th=

The USA has the world's largest prison population (2=2C000=2C000 inmates=3B=
 this does not includes camps for detained illegal aliens and their familie=
s)=2C  and supports=2C arms=2C funds=2C  the building and keeping of the wo=
rld's largest prison in history--Gaza--1=2C500=2C000 inmates--

From these sources one may begin to find very large and long prison plays a=
nd writings and poetries indeed--

To begin with=2C online one may find a great deal of writing From Gaza--alo=
ng with long breaks when the electricity is shut down-for many of the contr=
ibutors--
but these writings=2C blogs=2C images=2C sounds give an ongoing 40 years lo=
ng poem--
about his involvement with  which Jean Genet entitled his last completed wo=
rk=2C begun years earlier=2C PRISONER OF LOVE--

i think if one gather materials of Palestinian poets including Darwish over=
 the course of forty years it would be a very very long poem=2C and also ab=
out the world's largest prison in history--one which an Isreali Minister la=
st year said is destined to be the scene of a Shoa--(his word)--

it is modeled in part on another system of prisons and exterminations throu=
gh times which includes imprisonment through disease=2C land and water remo=
val=2C deportations=2C enclosures known as reservations=2C deliberate distr=
ibution of alcohol and drugs to the population--one might well look to Bury=
 My Heart at Wound Knee for a long prison poem continued today at this very=
 moment by Leonard Peltier in his Prison Writings--

and the Black Ghetto writings=2C plays=2C poems of generations of writers--=
Amiri Baraka's works--as just one example--among hundreds including in musi=
c=2C film=2C dance--

Brendan Behan wrote several plays re his prison experiences after being cap=
tured by the British as young IRA would-be bomber. =20
An Gail/The Hostage=2C The Quare Fellow (I haven't seen Richard's Cork leg =
so don't know the setting) and three or so radio plays=2C one acts

the works of Francois Villon a huge if not al amount of his poetry is  imbu=
ed with the criminal/prisoner "thinking=2C" and has many a description of l=
ife inside the hell holes of 15th Century France=2C including one of the mo=
st famous of al time--The Ballad of the Hanged Men--
as he we twice condemned to hang and twice pardoned at the very last instan=
t--
he was water boarded a huge number of times as well as undergoing many othe=
r tortures of the period=2C of which waterboarding and a few others have fo=
und fresh life in the 20th Century and are used routinely in Israel=2C Egyp=
t
and other countries=2C and have come to stand for the "Cancer of Democracy"=
 in the USA of the last 8 years and is still ongoing.=20

Also the poetry of Abdell Latiff=2C a great deal available in English is co=
ncerned with prison where he spent 8 years in Morocco=2C and a book he also=
 wrote about what his first days out of prison were like.

The great Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet wrote a great deal of his poetry and ot=
her prose works while a prisoner for decades.

The Greek poet Yannis Ritsos was for some years placed in another form of p=
rison--ioof an ancient kind--he was placed on barren and barely ahibted isl=
ands from which he had no chance of escape=2C and was at the mercy of the w=
hims of the American supported Junta.

A great many of Genet's plays even when not taking place in prison directly=
=2C are exhibiting the thought patterns and behaviors of persons who=2C in =
Franz Fanon's great word/concept=2C "interiorized" a prison and colonial ex=
perience=2C so that their lives are haunted and controlled by bars and guar=
ds and locks not visible=2C but existing just as powerfully inside their ve=
ry beings.

And though no poems of great length are in the book=2C the book as a whole =
of The Guantanamo Poets is extremely interesting to examine as creating man=
y aspects of a long poem in terms of the manner of their appearnce in Engli=
sh and also in terms of the great number of years the prisoners have underg=
one some of the most deracinating and dehumanizing forms of treatment possi=
ble.

A play which is not set in a prison but shows another form of prison--hard =
core drug addiction--though a bit dated in terms of the junkie slang--is Ja=
ck Gelber's The Connection.
Actually when I think of it it is pretty dated--but addiction itself is a p=
rison--which leds to "jails=2C institutions and death"--

It depends on how one views the concept of the Prison.  In many societies=
=2C by Western standards=2C women are virtually prisoners=2C leading an imp=
risoned and severely curtailed and controlled existence.  (This includes fo=
rms of Judaism and Christianity also=2C not solely Islam as usually portray=
ed in the US media.)

In the USA=2C which has the world's largest prison population both numerica=
lly and in percentage of total population=2C the effects of prison ahead of=
 time on a great number of young people in the society creates a person who=
 even when "free" is imprisoned by the dedication to a destiny which leads =
to prison at college age=2C and do becomes "my college."  The prison set-up=
 for millions begins before even entering the physical prison=2C so that an=
 imprisoned mind's battle is "dramatized" in a series of ritual=2C narrativ=
es=2C scripts=2C and beliefs and o creates this _doomed -to-be-prisoner mer=
cilessly=2C ruthlessly or terrifiedly advancing towards the prison doors as=
 to and assignation with Destiny=2C a Fate "already written=2C" a long (Tim=
e) poem that exists before being written down in documents because already =
the poetics of the mind set has found its own lyricism which creates ahead =
of time the life of the prisoner-to-be.

Other forms of prison are the mental institutions--and the old age homes--t=
he health care system--esp at the VA hospitals--much of the health care sys=
tem is really a eugenics set up to rid the soceity of the poor--the useless=
--
the systems of detention and conditions of employment and housing of illega=
l alien workers of the "Gitmos Across the USA"=20

another prison system growing rapidly is the international sex trade--
while the ever increasing use of drugs as crack and huge new waves of heroi=
n hit the suburbs--bring with them new members of the "world's oldest profe=
ssion"--

The USA has a total of over 700 bases world wide and various attached priso=
n sites secret and not secret around the world=2C either attached directly =
to bases=2C or indirectly via rendition flights=2C or the sending of prison=
ers to other countries to be tortured and imprisoned indefinitely--

Despite President Obama's pronouncements=2C very little is changed nor wil =
change.  Many of the methods of interrogation which have been announced wil=
 be foregone with a return to the old manual followed by the Army--are now =
included in the updated  old Army manual.

Considered overall=2C the USA and its ally Israel are societies dependent u=
pon the use of torture=2C coercion=2C force=2C imprisonment on a vast scale=
=2C and the converting of Security and Prison/Panopticon equipments and tec=
hnologies to high profits.  In the US=2C prisons are Big Business=2C just a=
s the privatized security companies from the US and Israel are a new form o=
f Big Business.  These Security firms can be hired by any entity that can a=
fford them--gated communities=2C cities=2C states=2C wealthy individuals=2C=
 drug lords=2C movie stars--with the actions of these existing in a blurry =
as yet to be determined legal zone=2C representing the danger of the creati=
on of new forms of prisons as yet unimaginable--other than as updated versi=
ons of the dungeons and oubliettes of the nobility of the past=2C each loca=
l fiefdom having its own particular hell hole to cast the locally offensive=
 into.

This suggests why perhaps it might be interesting to conduct the prison-set=
-drama as indeed the classroom it is perceived to be=2C the college from wh=
ich to graduate--by millions of young men and women inthe USA today--
except that the classroom would be the one one finds on college campuses an=
d perhaps indeed a Poetics or drama classroom--

is it not easy enough to set a prison play inside a prison setting--
heck every night on cable one can see the prison shows--

what really might be a challenge and interesting is to examine the drama=2C=

In Australia every state has a minister for the arts, and often, the
Premier of the state likes to have the portfolio because it  adds to
the perception of his  persona as being a person of great cultural
distinction. Even though usually he knows fuck all about the actual
arts constituency.

Since the 1970s the federal government has also always had a Minister
for the Arts. Currently it's Peter Garrett, the Minister for the
Environment who has the extra portfolio of the arts. He was once
therobotically dancing, lead singer of the rock band, Midnight Oil.

Before now we had a Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Sport.

That's egalitarianism for ya.

The MOST FAMOUS minister for the Yartz in Australia, was of course,
Sir Les Patterson
You can look him up here

You have nothing to fear, poets of North America

Oh my god, I have heard of this kind of point of view but I have
never before heard someone utter it!

So I guess if that is not ideological nothing is.

I mean even using the word "free" in that context is ideological.

Happy Saint Valentine's to You all. I had the pleasant surprise this mornin=
g
to find the present announcement in my mailbox.

Mark Young, the Editor, says he has to sell 100 copies to cut down expenses=
,
and I dearly recommend that at least 100 people buy it. But if you cannot,
please send me your address and as soon as I have several addresses, I will
buy a bunch and have them sent through lulu.

A schooling in experimental cinema happening before our eyes.  A screening.
Frame upon frame, the seeing I making her way.  In these remarkable poems,
Anny Ballardini creates an important new space, a new kind of poem=97note,
notation, response, criticism, a philosophy of our lives as films respondin=
g
to films, poems made from & making our new dwelling place.  "The eye of the
camera centers on their hidden hearts."  Made of quotation, of citation, of
sight, of insight=97always the moving site=97a dance in many movements.  An=
d a
fine, inviting, moving dance it is, Anny's *Ghost Dance in 33
Movements*! =97*Hank
Lazer*



Anny Ballardini is the unofficial poet laureate of UbuWeb; from her perch i=
n
Italy she has watched the 20th century avant-garde stream through her
computer's screen and has taken copious notes on it. These notes=97at once
literary criticism, poetry, oblique autobiography and amazing eavesdrop=97c=
ome
to us as an idiosyncratic transcript of a cultural and personal archive.
This is 21st century ekphrasis written to an art that flickers and sings an=
d
sometimes screams. =97*Susan M. Schultz*

The yams growing in different directions! That's amazing.
//
I have a small garden, but live in New England so the growing season is relatively short. It evolved the most as my mother was in hospice. There a slate path covered in creeping thymes, wooly and citrus mostly. I tried for strong smells that open and invigorate and white and purples. Moonflowers are tremendous, veiny climbers that open at night.
//
As for the interface: I write in a hut in the garden. As well, I do visual poetry outside. Down the center of a grassy patch I spread out paper, and make marks, shapes, dance along these big sheets. Poems emerge from them.

VOICES OF THE LADY. COLLECTED POEMS by Stuart Z. Perkoff from
The National Poetry Foundation, University of Maine

The only US writer that I can think of that has long poems and is from a prisoner. There's Etheridge but no long book. All of Baca's book longs were all written after he was out, except, maybe for the second on New Directions, I forget now tho.

I thought that this was worth mentioning again: Baca taught himself to read and write while in prison. I find that stunning.

Not direct hits, but check out the poetry of Etheridge Knight, and the
memoir A Place to Stand by Jimmy Santiago Baca. Neither play nor long poem
per se, but certainly literary and informed prison experience. Excerpts of
the Baca book could work as monologues.

Oh, so only artists who get grants are true artists. And, from the sounds of things, only those who get government grants. Nice to know that that's how you define an artist. I guess you leave out those who don't get grants and who get into galleries or get published. I suppose you leave out all those people in film, including screenplay writers, those involved in plays operas, musicals, the many musicians out there, etc. The arts are wildly successful in this country -- but only if we include the successful ones in our definition of what an artist is -- meaning, those who don't need government grants.

good grief, what's a "true artist" and what does it mean to "be an artist"? I'm sorry, this is ridiculous. "people who don't want to anything can play at making art"? Have you ever really been involved with the grant system? You think money goes to people who are "playing"?

this country gives less per capita than any industrialized country to the arts. what really gets me infuriated about this is the number of artists I know who can't afford health care or decent housing because of lack of support.

this is insulting.

on any other list this would be a troll.

All tons of government support will do is make it so that people who don't want to do anything can play at making art, reducing the quality and reputation of art and artists. Further, I really do not think you want to democratize the arts. Do you want a committee deciding if what you do is art? Do you really want your work put up to a vote? Subject to political pressures? This is the reality of something like this.

So many artists cannot BE ARTISTS because there is simply no support. I am sure that the office could be developed in such a way that we would be able to address any violations to free expression and with careful selection/ screening of a Secretary (as we try to do whenever any other Secretary if nominated) we could have a then have a thriving artistic community. Certainly with all the cuts to arts education, we cannot expect to have a group of young people less appreciative of what the arts might do for their lives, not the least of which is development of the imagination.

Actually, tariffs, monopolies, theft, slavery, etc. are not elements of the free market, but undermine the free market. Certainly tariffs and monopolies are created by governments, not the free market. Taxation is theft, and occurs outside of free exchange of goods. A slave economy is also the opposite of a market economy. In fact, every other economy but the free market has been and is a slave economy.

And clearly you know nothing about animals, otherwise you would know that theft is in fact natural.

THANK YOU, Ryan! And, actually, claims to the constative acknowledgment of =

Let me guess, Troy, you call yourself "libertarian"? Whatever you call your=

 it certainly does not render them self-evidently true, as you obviously be=

I've been translating a few Icelandic poets into English lately - the serie=
s
will eventually have 25 poets.

These five are already up:

Think about that! &=C2=A0






Photo-art?=C2=A0
The ampersand is evil, or am I missing the point of this purple, computer-g=
enerated, mirage?




"poetics"=3Dplural noun, treated as singular. The art of writing poetry, or=
 literary discourse or theories on writing poetry.


What is this listserv group about? Insanity or boredom? Seems that a select=
 few are actually interested in the art of poetry, etc.

The Presidency under which the NEA received its most ever funding was Richa=
rd Nixon's.
Not to mention the appointment of Elvis Presley as an Honorary Deputy of th=
e DEA!
An occaision memorialized for al time in a series of fotos stil the most po=
pularly viewed of all time at the National  Security Archives online.

Elvis in true "Dark Shadows" form sweeps in with the two feet thick shades=
=2C the small version cape=2C the toned down version of the  suit--a genuin=
e walking pharmacopia for once abroad in broad daylight--King Dracula being=
 Warmly Welcomed by the One for Whom CREEP would toil--

Were there that Day the Sounds of Ominous Sonic Boom Thunder Claps=2C set l=
oose across the Fruited Plains and Amber Waves of Grain by the whip crackin=
g movements of Giant Incandescent Snakes Uncoiling in the Sky--were the ris=
ing winds not scented with sulfur--was there not indeed a sensation of Shoc=
k and Awe--in the rarefied strati of the Cosmological Heights as the King a=
nd the Presdent -(-"I AM the President") repaired to a concealed "Smoke Fil=
led Back Room" to indulge in some serious "State of the Union's Drug Proble=
m"  Excesses=2C reciting al the while Blake's "The Marriage of Heaven and H=
ell" and in partricular=2C chanted at random intervals as a kind of chorus=
=2C  the lines "the Road of Excess leads to the Palace of Wisdom" . . .=20

Unfortunately=2C though the President's famous taping system had recorded t=
his event for prosperity er-posterity--Col Parker was no fool=2C and had hi=
s henchmen retrieve the magic spools and save them to blackmail the King wi=
th=2C next time he threatened to drop the Ol' Kernel like a useless empty p=
ill bottle--

(Who knows=2C  with his biggest ever NEA budget=2C perhaps Nixon was stil c=
ompeting with the Kennedys' "Camelot" cultural Aura even after the Kennedys=
 had literally all three brothers ceased being a "threat" to Tricky Dick an=
d his "Silent Majority.")

Just think how much times have changed!
Nixon put a dope fiend in "charge" Honorarally of policing the Drug Problem=
--
and "Plumbers" with names like Bebe Rebozo crossing the Mean Streets of the=
 Capitol with Paper bags full of a Million Bucks in Bail Out Money--
and nowadays=20
Wall Street Bankers & Tax Cheats with Lobbyist Deputies are in charge for R=
EAL of "regulating" the Banks=2C the Loans=2C the Economy which they were m=
errily trashing before being sworn into office--
and Bebe Rebozo has mutated into "Bibi" Netanyahu!

"I am not a Crook" croaked the Raven--nevermore!

Yes, his is an amazing story. I teach at a community college in Western MA
and use excerpts from his book in developmental classes when I teach them.
The students here can throw a stone to find someone in their family who has
spent time in  jail, had trouble with drugs, been a homeless kid, been
abandoned by parents. Often they barely learned to read from poor schools
and hard lives. Baca 's story is powerful stuff and despite my proclivity
for the  postmodern, a testament to the sheer lyric  transformative power of
straight up language for many. Especially for those who still need to be
empowered on and with the page in  any context.

I am jumping into this discussion late--Baca also wrote the screenplay to t=
he outstanding movie--Blood In Blood Out. Perhaps it has been mentioned. A =
lot of the movie takes place in a maximum security Californai prison--can't=
 remember the name of it. I think that it is an amazing movie--but it is a =
movie.=20

Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

Precisely the opposite here...so many who are considered "artists" are simply NOT and we should blithely pretend that they are? I am very much aware of those people whose work was not state sponsered as being artists. Some artists are forunate enough not to need government support, bbut there are so many who might continue to work if they did have support. And forgive me, but my breath of what I consider to be the arts is vast. Nonetheless, it would be appropriate and just to support people who are devoted artists...people who eat, sleep and breathe their art despite the sacrifice to do so. So much of what people in this country call art is tied to economy. It is what sells. I think about the great artists whose devotion to the expression of that something inside, something that is inspired because the heart was open to the possibility of being and because they could not survive in a world that places too much emphasis on monetary outcomes compels me to say YES!!!! to any pos
 s!
!
ibility that a supposedly civilized society wishes to establish as a means of support for that expression.
I come from a family (in Europe) whose artistic voices were silenced in 1933. Artistic freedom is one thing the people fought for after the war- and its government's  support for the arts. Support so that perhaps they might find their humanity in the aftermath of so much inhumanity. And yes perhaps there are no perfect agencies-that is to say in this particular case, one that would be fair and just (and YES I do believe that these are viable attributes and I am not a REPUBLICAN nor a DEMOCRAT nor an INDEPENDENT)but I still believe in my ideal world that the arts should be supported not by the government but rather through it. The government's only vested interest should be one that fosters free expression as a means of allowing its artists to be the voice of its people. That is what the arts should do and that which does not do this but passes itself as art is merely what Joyce said is pornagraphy.

I guess you leave out those who don't get grants and who get into galleries or get published. I suppose you leave out all those people in film, including screenplay writers, those involved in plays operas, musicals, the many musicians out there, etc. The arts are wildly successful in this country -- but only if we include the successful ones in our definition of what an artist is -- meaning, those who don't need government grants.

All tons of government support will do is make it so that people who don't want to do anything can play at making art, reducing the quality and reputation of art and artists. Further, I really do not think you want to democratize the arts. Do you want a committee deciding if what you do is art? Do you really want your work put up to a vote? Subject to political pressures? This is the reality of something like this.

So many artists cannot BE ARTISTS because there is simply no support. I am sure that the office could be developed in such a way that we would be able to address any violations to free expression and with careful selection/ screening of a Secretary (as we try to do whenever any other Secretary if nominated) we could have a then have a thriving artistic community.

Dipping down into young adult literature I suggest Monster by Walter Dean
Myers (and several others of his books) but this novel is written as if it'=
s
a movie script.  And Jack Gantos's memoir Hole In My Life speaks about the
year he spent in prison while he was 19.

This is a troll, folks. I never said what you're implying; in fact the
category of "true artist" is assinine which I point out in the first line
- that's your phrase not mine.

And where you get the idea this applies only to galleries is beyond me.

I'm sorry this is just stupid and arrogant and insulting. And you're
clearly not reading anyone's responses or thinking about them - judging
from your comments below.

And I've encountered art that was supported by the government. Doesn't mean it wouldn't have been supported in some other way if it weren't supported by the government. I know that almost everyone here wants everyone to be an artist -- it's the egalitarian in you. But I've known lots of people who weren't artists, but only play-acted at being artists. Those people who only wrote short stories when they were assigned them in their short story writing class. Those people who only painted when assigned a painting to do in class. Those kinds. I would throw into the same category anyone who can't be bothered to learn the history of the art they are working in and those who can't stand criticism. Play-actors, not real artists. And being a play-actor doesn't mean you can't be successful. I think Damien Hurst is a play-actor at being an artist, and he's laughing all the way to the bank.

And, yes, I know I'm putting myself out there. In bunch of Left-wing artists? Whoda thunk it?

As for the market not being natural because it's human -- that's based on the false assumption that just because it's human that it's unnatural. Free market economies occur when people are able to trade freely with each other without anyone's outside interference. Those two people are the ones best able to determine if they are gaining value from that trade. When someone comes along and tells those two people that they are wrong about what they should and should not value, they are trying to impose their own ideology on the transaction. It is no less ideological if that person is a government and forces some other transaction than the one the two people were interested in engaging in. For me to rather have a bushel of corn rather than a chicken isn't ideological -- it's a matter of personal taste. For you to say that I should prefer the chicken is ideological. And free markets are self-organized. Nobody out there plans the economy in a free market
 economy. Thus, it is not organized in that sense.

It's really hard to read these posts and not be tempted to outright
provocation, but this is a list about poetry and poetics so I will try to
stay on topic.
You say:

Well, I've never met anybody from Djibouti...

but I have read many books that may not exist without governmental support.
I'm thinking specifically of Roof Books (although I'm sure there are many
other fine organizations) which has thrived with support from the NEA and
other organizations I've never heard of.

But I really can't help myself:

Troy, my man, you really put yourself out there when you post on this list.

And supporting free markets, a naturally-occurring, self-organizing system,
> is not ideological at all


I hate to break this to you, but markets were invented by humans. They don't
occur naturally, and we organize them in absolutely every sense of the
word.

The myth of the starving artist--van gogh's the most renowned--died in the
late 20th century--about the time Warhol came in with Pop.  If you're any
good as an artist--that means if you've been able to contribute to the
development of the art form you work in--you'll sell your work. Though 90%+
of artists who sell still need to supplement their sales by teaching--though
that vocation does have its perks.

I like this: "grow[ing] organic" and writ[ing] vegetatively. Brings to
mind mIEKAL's visual farm poems, which he allowed us to view recently.

A hut in the garden? That's a special place to write. I have been
thinking of a tree house myself. My children want it badly -- they,

(Interestingly I had to pull this letter out of my SPAM reject file!)

February 3 2009

Dear All,

Last
week, with initial hesitation but finally strong conviction, I endorsed
the Call for a U.S. Cultural and Academic Boycott of
Israel.=A0=A0=A0HYPERLINK "http://usacbi.wordpress.com/" http://usacbi.word=
press.com/=A0=A0=A0I=92d like to offer my reasons to friends, family and co=
mrades.=A0 I have tried in fullest conscience to think this through.

My
hesitation:=A0=A0=A0 I profoundly believe in the visible/invisible liberato=
ry
social power of creative and intellectual boundary-crossings.=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0I=92ve
been educated by these all my life, and by centuries-long
cross-conversations about human freedom, justice and power=97also, the
forces that try to silence them.=20

As an American Jew,
over almost 30 years, I=92ve joined with other concerned Jews in various
kinds of coalition-building and anti-Occupation work.=A0=A0=A0I=92ve seen t=
he
kinds of=A0 organized efforts to stifle=97in the US and elsewhere--
critiques of Israel=92s policies--the Occupation=92s denial of Palestinian
humanity, destruction of Palestinian lives and livelihoods, the
=93settlements,=94 the state=92s physical and psychological walls against
dialogue=97and the efforts to condemn any critiques as
anti-Semitism.=A0=A0=A0Along with other activists and writers I=92ve been n=
amed
on right-wing =93shit-lists=94 as =93Israel-hating=94 or=A0 =93Jew-hating.=
=94=A0=A0=A0I
have also seen attacks within American academia and media on Arab
American, Muslim, Jewish scholars and teachers whose work critically
explores the foundations and practices of Israeli state and society.=A0=20

Until
now, as a believer in boundary-crossings, I would not have endorsed a
cultural and academic boycott.=A0 But Israel=92s continuing, annihilative
assaults in Gaza, and the one-sided rationalizations for them have
driven me to re-examine my thoughts about cultural exchanges.=A0 =A0
Israel=92s blockading of information, compassionate aid, international
witness and free cultural and scholarly expression has become extreme
and morally stone-blind.=A0 Israeli Arab parties have been banned from
the elections, Israeli Jewish dissidents arrested, Israeli youth
imprisoned for conscientious refusal of military service. Academic institut=
ions
are surely only relative sites of power.=A0 But they are, in their
funding and governance, implicated with state economic and military
power.=A0 And US media, institutions and official policy have gone along
with all this.

To boycott a repressive military state should not
mean backing away from individuals struggling against the policies of
that state.=A0 So, in continued solidarity with the Palestinian people=92s
long resistance, and also with those Israeli activists, teachers,
students, artists, writers, intellectuals, journalists, refuseniks,
feminists and others who oppose the means and ends of the Occupation,=A0
I have signed my name to this call.=20

Adrienne Rich=20

Obviously country music in general has a wealth of songs dealing with
prison, but specifically David Allan Coe has a lot to say about it. Here's
an excerpt from the Allmusic guide:

I remember looking at the liner notes for the recent reissue of Penitentiar=
y
Blues and there was an excerpt from Coe's book Ex-Convict. The excerpt deal=
t
with how to get out of prison and stay out. It was like he was almost
addicted to being in prison and had to rehabilitate himself to live in the
outside  world.

May be of interest if you want to go that route.

A new collaborative book of interwriting by Sheila E. Murphy and
mIEKAL aND has just been published by Xerox Sutra Editions in rural
Wisconsin ...

"How to spell the sound of everything"

http://www.xexoxial.org

For someone familiar with the individual writings of mIEKAL aND and
Sheila Murphy ( as I am) there are surprising turns and twists in the
verbal material in this book, and even more surprising contexts for
its form.  Indeed, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts!

any BA or BFA in CW programs that anyone would recommend for a high school

This is for the child of a friend of a friend.

Me, I'd way rather my kids did some other kind of undergraduate degree even
if they wanted to go on to creative writing.

But are there any programs out there that anyone admires?

Subject:      On that 'Stimulus' art funding
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

It is curiousthat in the discussion of
whether or not the Arts should be included in the President=92s
=93Stimulus=94 package, not much is discussed about the essential relevance
of the arts, including poetry, in a time of national/global crisis.
Understandably, from a bread and butter point of view, some of the
argument for funding is about sustaining cultural institutions,
including employment of the musicians, artists, writers and poets whose liv=
elihood
comes from working in theaters, school programs and so forth. And this
argument gets spread in the direction of the ways in which cultural
institutions contribute to and buttress local economies.

What is not being addressed is the way in which the arts may both
document and shape a way or ways through this crisis (darkness). It=92s as =
if the
argument - the way it is framed - is about making sure that the
orchestras are still playing to the theaters on the Titantic! I think
it is so unlike the discussions that surrounded the goals of the Civilian
Conservation Core and the Works Progress Administration in the 30=92s
during Roosevelt=92s New Deal programs. At 25% National Unemployment -
and a big chunk of despair in the populations, a chunk of which was
attracted to Fascist economic and political solutions - Roosevelt had
to bring some real vision to the democracy making=A0 function and importanc=
e of cultural
institutions - both the artist makers as well as the buildings
(libraries, performance spaces, etc.)

The same right wing opposition to the =91leftist=92 arts was as present the=
n as now among Republicans in Congress.

But it is curious, as in today=92s New York Times article, where it takes
Robert Redford to call Nancy Pelosi and use the financial success and
dollar value of Sundance to his community as the reason to support the
arts. Why the democratic congressional leadership did not have the
confidence and smarts to support the arts on their own is scary enough,
but maybe not surprising given their track record in taking on Bush in
the last two years.=20
=09Well,
it=92s probably all back to us, =91the makers=92 to make the stuff that mak=
es
argument for the value and support work that will contribute to moving
the country out of an impending abyss. (Anybody reading the business
pages knows it is such).=20
=09Does anybody know who is shaping
Obama=92s vision on the Arts? Beyond Aretha and Stevie Wonder, I wonder
if there is an unhelpful emptiness there (?).=A0=20
Not wanting=A0 to suggest here that the Feds will, or should=A0 come up wit=
h "the Vision", but that the presence of financial support will drive creat=
ive work into the public sphere, no doubt some of it wonderful but entirely=
 off the charts in terms Federal 'imaginations.'=20


=09(for those unfamiliar with Depression era art programs, from a yet unpub=
lished essay by D. J, Waldie
=09=85
Although they lasted only until 1943,
New Deal art programs employed thousands of artists and craftspeople to
produce, by some estimates, at least 2,566 murals, 17,774 sculptures,
108,099 easel paintings, 250,000 prints, 500,000 photographs, and
perhaps two million posters.
 The New Deal=92s arts apparatus was an
amalgam of locally managed projects and competing centers of financing
and administration in Washington that had different goals for the
public art they supported. Before 1935, programs under the Public Works
of Art Project and the Treasury Department=92s Section of Painting and
Sculpture (later the Section of Fine Arts) were explicitly job creation
programs to get artists off relief during the hard winter of 1933-1934.
Idealistically, the PWAP promised art for every school, hospital,
library, orphanage, and practically every other public building in the
nation. It failed to reach that goal, but it did employ almost 3,000
artists and craftspeople and generated enormous interest in
contemporary American art through more than 450 local exhibitions. In
1934, 33,000 of the curious turned out to open a PWAP exhibition at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, smashing single-day attendance
records for any previous California art show. Almost as many visited
the Corcoran Art Gallery in Washington for a similar PWAP exhibition.
The Roosevelts selected 32 of the works for display in the White House.
Just as the New Deal sought to restore confidence and liquidity in a
devastated system of credit and finance through government
intervention, the New Deal also sought to restore the market in
contemporary art that had been destroyed by the Depression.

After 1935, under the WPA=92s Federal Art Program and the Treasury=92s
Section of Fine Arts, relief for unemployed artists contended with
aesthetic concerns. Artists were still chosen to work based on
eligibility, but also =96 typically in the Treasury=92s art program =96 on
technical competence as judged through design competitions. The
Treasury=92s =93Section=94 art went into federal buildings with the
expectation that they would be permanent installations. Their message
was intended to be uplifting. Their range of expression was relatively
narrow. But FAP art went everywhere in every possible form,
coincidentally subsidizing a rising generation of younger artists =96
Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Philip Evergood, Mark
Tobey, and Arshile Gorky among them. FAP projects welcomed styles from
regionalist realism through Mexican muralism to avant-guard Surrealism.
Local project sponsors still had final say in the selection of the
murals, paintings, and sculptures FAP artists produced, however.
Controversial subjects were not accepted. The social effects of the
Depression generally were not illustrated. The past was idealized as a
place of communitarian solidarity or the source of the positive forces
that propel us into the future. The present was made to look endurable,
if we all worked together. The future, of course, is majestic.

Within these constraints and conflicting purposes, the art programs of
the New Deal stove mainly to give work to artists (including a
significant number of African-American and Latino artists). After they
had been paid their small weekly wage and after their work had been
displayed, what lingered had less to do with their art than with
America. The New Deal sought a broad democratization of the American
experience. Embedded in that search were ideas of home, community, and
labor by which the New Deal sought to frame a new social compact with
the American people, a compact that was founded partly on the art that
New Deal agencies commissioned to depict it. And for Californians, so
used to the state=92s extravagant sales pitch and the flimsiness of its
official past, the art of the New Deal also meant the creation of
something tangible from the newness of California, something that would
have enough power to sustain their memories and hopes=85

I'm forwarding this call for work on behalf of the editorial staff of
this magazine, and I'm a faculty adviser.  The deadline just passed,
but if you send work in the next few days, they'll take it.  The
magazine is a print magazine, and it's nicely done typically.

Hello!
  I think some people on this list may be fans, or at least enjoy
reading the work, of Alice Notley.
   So, I need a little help for a project I'm working on.

Could you send me a list of, say, your Top 5 favorite Alice Notley
short (meaning no more than 2 pages, preferably closer to 1) poems---

If it's less than 5, that's fine too....
  (if not in any definitive sense, at least as a guide...)

You will remain anonymous if you prefer....

You may CC your reply to the list, but please backchannel me as well,
as I don't read this list every day.

Thanks again--

Chris

    BEIJING =97 A prominent Chinese writer known for
provocative=2C antiestablishment Web postings was stabbed and wounded
during a book reading on Saturday.
      The writer=2C Xu Lai=2C a
newspaper reporter=2C novelist and blogger whose satirical Internet
postings are widely followed by students=2C journalists and the Chinese
literati=2C may have been singled out for his writings=2C his friends and
associates said.=20
Mr. Xu was accosted in a restroom by two men who stabbed him in the stomach=
 and then threatened to cut off his hand before fleeing=2C according to the=
 friends and fellow bloggers who posted the news on the Internet.
Xiao
Sanlang=2C who edits Mr. Xu=92s articles at The Beijing News=2C said the me=
n
had announced that they were =93here to take revenge.=94 He said Mr. Xu
remained in the hospital on Sunday=2C but his wounds were not
life-threatening. =93We still don=92t know why it happened=2C=94 he said.=20
In
a country where violence against journalists is rare=2C the bold assault
stirred fears and a flurry of rumors. Some people suggested the attack
may have stemmed from Mr. Xu=92s writings=2C many of which take swipes at
government corruption or poke fun at the ruling Communist Party. In
recent weeks=2C Mr. Xu=92s blog has included items on censorship=2C the mel=
amine milk scandal and the fire that destroyed part of the new CCTV complex=
 in Beijing last week.=20
In China=2C
writers are given far more latitude for Web postings than for their
work in newspapers and magazines. Still=2C there are limits to Internet
expression.=20
Mr. Xu=92s blog=2C ProState in Flames=2C was carried by
Bullog=2C a liberal Web site=2C until the government shut down Bullog last
month. His writings can still be found elsewhere on the Internet=2C
although individual postings and links are sometimes deleted by
censors.=20
Word of the attack quickly spread by text message and the Twitter messaging=
 service=2C and several newspapers and Web sites carried the news on Sunday=
.=20
In
scores of posted comments=2C people expressed worry that the attack
reflected a growing intolerance of dissent. Others blamed the
undercurrent of Chinese nationalism that bubbles to the surface from
time to time. =93This kind of =91battle without gunpowder=92 will probably
become more severe as time goes on=2C=94 said a blogger called Rainforest.=
=20
In
the comments area of Mr. Xu=92s blog=2C one reader expressed a defiance
that was reflected in many postings: =93Comrades=2C netizens=2C such a
despicable trick cannot stop the progress of Chinese people towards
freedom and democracy=2C because this is the tide of history.=94=20
After
Mr. Xu=92s stabbing=2C several audience members chased his attackers into
the street=2C snapping pictures with their cellphones as they ran=2C but
the two men escaped.
The police said they were investigating the
attack=2C according to newspaper accounts. On Monday the police said they
had no immediate comment.
Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting=2C and Huang Yuanxi contributed res=
earch.

1. Hampshire College becomes first college in U.S. to divest from

Israeli Occupation
http://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox/11f6e81c162827eb

Posted February 12=2C 2009



Hampshire College becomes first college in U.S. to divest from Israeli

Occupation

Hampshire College in Amherst=2C MA=2C has become the first of any college

or university in the U.S. to divest from companies on the grounds of

their involvement in the Israeli occupation of Palestine.



This landmark move is a direct result of a two-year intensive campaign

by the campus group=2C Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). The

group pressured Hampshire College's Board of Trustees to divest from

six specific companies due to human rights concerns in occupied

Palestine. Over 800 students=2C professors=2C and alumni have signed SJP's

"institutional statement" calling for the divestment.



The proposal put forth by SJP was approved on Saturday=2C 7 Feb 2009 by

the Board. By divesting from these companies=2C SJP believes that

Hampshire has distanced itself from complicity in the illegal

occupation and war crimes of Israel.



Meeting minutes from a committee of Hampshire's Board of Trustees

confirm that "President Hexter acknowledged that it was the good work

of SJP that brought this issue to the attention of the committee."

This groundbreaking decision follows in Hampshire's history of being

the first college in the country to divest from apartheid South Africa

thirty-two years ago=2C a decision based on similar human rights

concerns. This divestment was also a direct result of student

pressure.



The divestment has so far been endorsed by Noam Chomsky=2C Howard Zinn=2C

Rashid Khalidi=2C Vice President of the EU Parliament Luisa Morganitini=2C

Cynthia McKinney=2C former member of the African National Congress

Ronnie Kasrils=2C Mustafa Barghouti=2C Israeli historian Ilan Pappe=2C John

Berger=2C Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire=2C and Roger Waters of Pink

Floyd=2C among others.



The six corporations=2C all of which provide the Israeli military with

equipment and services in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza are:

Caterpillar=2C United Technologies=2C General Electric=2C ITT Corporation=
=2C

Motorola=2C and Terex (see attached info sheet for more information on

these corporations.) Furthermore=2C our policy prevents the reinvestment

in any company involved in the illegal occupation.



SJP is responding to a call from Palestinian civil society for

Boycott=2C Divestment=2C and Sanctions (BDS) as a way of bringing non-

violent pressure to bear on the state of Israel to end its violations

of international law. SJP is following in the footsteps of many noted

groups and institutions such as the National Association of Teachers

in Further and Higher Education in the UK=2C the Israeli group Gush

Shalom=2C the Congress of South African Trade Unions=2C the Canadian Union

of Public Employees=2C and the American Friends Service Committee.



As well as voicing our opposition to the illegal occupation and the

consistent human rights violations of the Palestinian people=2C we as

members of an institute of higher education see it as our moral

responsibility to express our solidarity with Palestinian students

whose access to education is severely inhibited by the Israeli

occupation.



SJP has proven that student groups can organize=2C rally and pressure

their schools to divest from the illegal occupation. The group hopes

that this decision will pave the way for other institutions of higher

learning in the U.S. to take similar stands.

Subject:      2 CALLS TO MAKE TODAY: Stop Obama Govt "No Change" on Torture;
              Close  School of the Americas

A few weeks ago=2C President Obama announced that=2C in keeping with Campai=
gn Promises he and others had made=2C Guantanamo would be closed=2C and wit=
h it the era of Torture by Americans.

Torture=2C however is not so easily gotten rid of.  Once it begins to be pr=
actised openly by a State=2C with the support of nearly half the population=
=2C torture becomes as the French writer Pierre Vidal-Nacquet described it =
 over 40 years ago=2C in the title of his classic work:  Torture:  Cancer o=
f Democracy  Algeria-France 1954-62.

President Obama proudly anounced that the US military would revert to its o=
ld and justly respected handling of prisoners as outlined in its standard F=
ield Manual.  AHH--one felt a great collective sigh of the guilt and shame =
of torture being lifted from the conscience of the Nation.  What the presid=
ent failed to mention=2C though=2C is that the methods introduced during th=
e last administration are no longer "outside" the norm=2C "beyond the pale=
=2C" --but are now part of the much revered Manual itself.

What was considered an extreme to be removed ASAP=2C in order to "recover o=
ur high standing the in the eyes of the World=2C" is not gone at all=2C but=
 has instead become part of the ROUTINE instruction and practice of the Mil=
itary.

Slowly=2C steadily=2C by increments=2C by small steps=2C tiny hops=2C  and =
then by leaps when a "crisis situation" demands it=2C a great many things f=
ormerly considered far too extreme for nearly any Americans to tolerate=2C =
let alone accept and even wholeheartedly support=2C have moved in to the Ce=
nter of the society and culture=2C and taken up very comfortable and what i=
t appears to be quite possibly very long term residence.

Who would ever have imagined or thought that whenthe US elected its first B=
lack President=2C he would "have to be" a stalwart supporter of an Aparthei=
d State? The cruelty=2C cynicism=2C disgracing and degrading  aspects of th=
is would not have been lost on Malcolm X or Dr. King.  From the President a=
nd his Advisors and Cabinet=2C through the Senate and House=2C to  the Supr=
eme and Federal and State Courts and  through every citizen=2C an immense=
=2C overturning  humiliation has occurred=2C with hardlyanyone noticing. Th=
at is=2C  al the deeply cherished=2C hard fought for for centuries  Ideals =
and Promises of what America and her first Black President are to be seen a=
s standing for--has turned into its exact opposite.  The "real change" in m=
anyways is not in moving "foward=2C" but in going backward with al the trap=
pings and celebration attending the first showing of the Emperor's New Clot=
hes.

The only real Change comes not from Super Heroies=2C  heroic figures and pi=
cturesque leaders=2C but from the immense acculumlation of little things do=
ne continusouly=2C and by their own choices=2C of the citizens themselves. =
 "The people" --always invoked=2C like some mythical Spirit=2C but rarely c=
alled upon for any reasons other than to "make sacrifices" in cleaning up t=
he catastrophes of the Leaders=2C and to make "the Ultimate Sacrifice" of d=
ying for the benefit of "US Interests in the Region."

The Govt thinks it can just call on you??? Thinks it can say--"Don't Call M=
e=2C I'll call you--"??--
CALL THEM First! and Keep on Calling them!!
They WANT YOU TO FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY--???--Fight THEM for it!--

Day to support legislation to close the School of the Americas=2C renamed

                                Last week we got new=2C startling evidence =
that the Obama administration may continue the failed Bush policies on tort=
ure and illegal detention.

                               =20

                                The first blow came last Monday=2C when a l=
awyer for the
new administration used the same "states secret" (or national security
concerns) argument put forward by the Bush administration in an attempt to =
dismiss the case of Binyam Mohamed=2C who was reportedly brutally tortured =
and detained without charges.1



                               =20

                                Then on Wednesday=2C before a key Republica=
n Senator=2C Solicitor General Nominee Elena Kagan said she believed the go=
vernment had the legal authority to detain suspected terrorists indefinitel=
y=2C without charges.2



                               =20

                                We fear that the Obama administration is fe=
eling intense pressure for its early=2C bold actions against Guantanamo Bay=
 and torture=2C and may be compromising to win political allies.



                               =20

Despite these troubling developments=2C we're gaining ground in the
Senate on our call for accountability. Thanks to your response to last
week's action=2C we delivered over 20=2C000 letters to the Senate=2C and on
Tuesday=2C Senator Patrick Leahy=2C chairman of the powerful Senate Judicia=
ry Committee joined our call for an independent investigation. In a meeting=
 with the White House=2C Leahy said he:

                                "would
hate to see us take the attitude that that was then and this is now=2C
let's not worry about any of the mistakes or the abuse of the law and
give it a pass ... because it is my experience that you continue to make mi=
stakes until somebody calls you on it." 3

                               =20
                                And importantly=2C in his interview with th=
e Huffington Post=2C Senator Leahy reportedly said that he would move forwa=
rd with or without the administration's blessing in seeking the truth.


Our best chance for accountability lies in the Senate. That's why it's so c=
ritical that today you call your Senators and urge them to support an indep=
endent investigation.



                                We have a brand new click-to-call tool that=
 will make calling your Senators so easy.
We'll give you a simple script and talking points. All you'll need to
do is enter your phone number=2C and our system will call your phone and
connect you directly to your Senator's office!

Let's give Senator Leahy the support he needs to follow through on setting =
up an independent investigation.
You and I must show Washington that the public refuses to ignore the
mistakes of the past=2C and that we must get to the bottom of how we
became a nation that tortures.=20


                                Make your call right now: it will take you =
less than 2 minutes and your one call will give Senator Leahy the support h=
e needs to move forward with his "truth commission".



We have our work cut out for us. But if we don't speak out=2C no one else
will. That's what it means to be part of the Amnesty movement: we speak out=
 for what's right=2C even when it's not politically convenient or popular.


We have to nip the Obama administration's backsliding on torture and
illegal detention before it goes any further.

Make your call today and show Washington that the voters want accountabilit=
y for torture.



                                Sincerely=2C

"As a constituent living in _________=2C I am calling
Congressman/woman ________ to urge him/her to contact Rep. McGovern and
ask to be an original cosponsor of the Latin America Military Training
Review Act of 2009=2C formerly HR 1707 in the 110th Congress. This
legislation will be introduced in the next few weeks. The bill is
identical to HR 1707and would suspend operations at the School of the
Americas=2C renamed WHINSEC=2C and investigate the history of human rights
abuses and failed policies of the institution.

New information indicates that WHINSEC has allowed known human
rights abusers to instruct and receive training at the school.
Argentina and Uruguay are two more countries that have made public
announcements they will no longer send students to the school=2C citing
the negative image and history of this institution. Despite demands by
Congress to have oversight over the curriculum and promote human
rights=2C the Pentagon is now denying all requests to provide information
to human rights organizations and the public about students and
graduates of the school.

I urge you to contact Cindy Buhl in Representative McGovern's
office and ask that your boss be added as an original cosponsor of this
legislation. I hope you will represent my views and support this bill."

Torture survivors Patricia Isasa from Argentina and Pablo Ruiz from
Chile and others are among the scores of human rights activists who are
visiting Congressional offices on Capitol Hill today to call for the
closure of the SOA/ WHINSEC. You can amplify their voices with your
phone call and let your Members of Congress know that there are
thousands around the country who feel very strongly about this issue.

As someone whose family were artists in WWII Europe, I would think you would be most wary of government promises and government-sponsored or "supported" art. Government has never done anything out goodness or purity of motives. It is always tied up with power. Perhaps in some ideal world we could have what you want. But nowhere in the real world has it ever happened. The real results in the real world have never been good for the arts.

This is precisely why I started The Emerson Institute. I have purposefully not tied it at all to the government. We will not be getting a single dime of support from the government. The idea is that the people can voluntarily patronize the arts through us. Anyone who is serious about the public patronizing the arts -- freely and not by force -- should be supporting what we are doing.

Precisely the opposite here...so many who are considered "artists" are simply NOT and we should blithely pretend that they are? I am very much aware of those people whose work was not state sponsered as being artists. Some artists are forunate enough not to need government support, bbut there are so many who might continue to work if they did have support. And forgive me, but my breath of what I consider to be the arts is vast. Nonetheless, it would be appropriate and just to support people who are devoted artists...people who eat, sleep and breathe their art despite the sacrifice to do so. So much of what people in this country call art is tied to economy. It is what sells. I think about the great artists whose devotion to the expression of that something inside, something that is inspired because the heart was open to the possibility of being and because they could not survive in a world that places too much emphasis on monetary outcomes compels me to
 say YES!!!! to any pos
s!
!
ibility that a supposedly civilized society wishes to establish as a means of support for that expression.
I come from a family (in Europe) whose artistic voices were silenced in 1933. Artistic freedom is one thing the people fought for after the war- and its government's  support for the arts. Support so that perhaps they might find their humanity in the aftermath of so much inhumanity. And yes perhaps there are no perfect agencies-that is to say in this particular case, one that would be fair and just (and YES I do believe that these are viable attributes and I am not a REPUBLICAN nor a DEMOCRAT nor an INDEPENDENT)but I still believe in my ideal world that the arts should be supported not by the government but rather through it. The government's only vested interest should be one that fosters free expression as a means of allowing its artists to be the voice of its people. That is what the arts should do and that which does not do this but passes itself as art is merely what Joyce said is pornagraphy.

>Oh, so only artists who get grants are true artists. And, from the sounds of things, only those who get government grants. Nice to know that that's how you define an artist. I guess you leave out those who don't get grants and who get into galleries or get published. I suppose you leave out all those people in film, including screenplay writers, those involved in plays operas, musicals, the many musicians out there, etc. The arts are wildly successful in this country -- but only if we include the successful ones in our definition of what an artist is -- meaning, those who don't need government grants.

All tons of government support will do is make it so that people who don't want to do anything can play at making art, reducing the quality and reputation of art and artists. Further, I really do not think you want to democratize the arts. Do you want a committee deciding if what you do is art? Do you really want your work put up to a vote? Subject to political pressures? This is the reality of something like this.

>> I must respond to this kind of hysteria that ultimately prevents us from making the arts what they should and could be, that is a reflection of what is happening in our society (since we cannot trust the media to convey anything reflectively nor honestly) and an example of what can occur when the human spirit is allowed to make itself manifest. So many artists cannot BE ARTISTS because there is simply no support. I am sure that the office could be developed in such a way that we would be able to address any violations to free expression and with careful selection/ screening of a Secretary (as we try to do whenever any other Secretary if nominated) we could have a then have a thriving artistic community. Certainly with all the cuts to arts education, we cannot expect to have a group of young people less appreciative of what the arts might do for their lives, not the least of which is development of the imagination.

In fact, there's a persuasive case to be made that slave markets were the perfect, ideal expression of free markets -- human flesh to the highest bidder, unimpeded by nasty old government intervention.  So here's a modest proposal for Mr. Camplin: let's solve poverty by bringing back chattel slavery.  The banks -- many of which got their start on the proceeds of slavery, e.g., Barclay's Bank -- would be simply delighted.  The prisons can get into the act, as indeed they are places where quasi-slave labor is perpetrated.  But in the real world, free markets are never free, and belief in them is rather like believing in creationism.

And this business about the "economy" showing signs of "recovery" -- tell that to the tens of thousands of people losing their jobs as the weeks go by.  But then again, maybe Mr. Camplin can start a program (privately funded, of course) to set them up as slave-traders, overseers, or lacking that, slaves.

I admire and helped create the unique BA Program in Writing & Literature =
at California College of the Arts in Oakland.  We put plenty of emphasis =
on literature and literary theory, along with "writing workshops."  I =
teach courses in the 19th century novel, Whitman, the modern =
international novel, and there are courses offered in World Lit, =
Masterpieces of Literature, The Gothic Novel, Modernism, Romanticism, =
etc.  Students also take a number of art history, visual criticism, and =
studio classes, as well as science and math.  They can study a foreign =
language at nearby Mills College for CCA credit. =20

Tree house yes! I have been building mine for years, gathering
materials to repurpose. I have given up on designing it, it will just
have to evolve. The trick is to construct something that absorbs the
differing sway of the trees. This is not a fixed rhyme, it must be
free verse or the whole structure will wrench apart. A lesson here
about organic poetry?

There were attempts to bring back chattel slavery. They were known as the Soviet Union, the Communist East Bloc, Communist China, Cuba -- now even Venezuela's trying to get in on the act. Slavery was and is the complete opposite of the free market. One is not free if one is a slave. Thus, one cannot engage in free trade if one is a slave.

In fact, you have your metaphor wrong. Free markets are naturally occurring systems. Thus, belief in them is like belief in evolution. Various socialist utopias are based entirely on ideology, and thus are more like creationism and intelligent design. In fact, both socialism and creationism posit the existence of a benign ruler-creator who loves us and only wants what is best for us, if only we believe in him.

In fact, there's a persuasive case to be made that slave markets were the perfect, ideal expression of free markets -- human flesh to the highest bidder, unimpeded by nasty old government intervention.  So here's a modest proposal for Mr. Camplin: let's solve poverty by bringing back chattel slavery.  The banks -- many of which got their start on the proceeds of slavery, e.g., Barclay's Bank -- would be simply delighted.  The prisons can get into the act, as indeed they are places where quasi-slave labor is perpetrated.  But in the real world, free markets are never free, and belief in them is rather like believing in creationism.

And this business about the "economy" showing signs of "recovery" -- tell that to the tens of thousands of people losing their jobs as the weeks go by.  But then again, maybe Mr. Camplin can start a program (privately funded, of course) to set them up as slave-traders, overseers, or lacking that, slaves.

**Atelos Publishing Project
http://www.atelos.org

Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip's Road, devoted to =20
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the =20
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended =20=

to isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and =20=

curtail its impact.

All the works published as part of the Atelos project are commissioned =20=

specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with crossing =20
traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that would =20=

separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama, =20
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, =20=

and so forth.

The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes.


*Performer Bios*

**Lisle Ellis
http://www.lisleellis.com/

Lisle Ellis pioneered the development of improvised and experimental =20
music in his native Canada. In Vancouver and Montreal in the 1980s, =20
Ellis was a conspicuous activator of musician alliance organizations, =20=

performance venues and concert series presentations. One collective, =20
Vancouver=92s New Orchestra Workshop, is active 30 years later.

After relocating to the U.S., Ellis=92s music began to attract acclaim =20=

on a global level. His recording, Kaleidoscopes: The Ornette Coleman =20
Songbook (Hat Art), with pianist Paul Plimley, was given five stars in =20=

Downbeat Magazine and has been hailed a modern masterpiece. He won =20
Canada=92s Frederick Stone Award in 1986.


**Ted Greenwald
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/greenwald/index.html

Ted Greenwald was born in Brooklyn, raised in Queens, and has lived in =20=

New York City his entire life. During the course of a career that has =20=

spanned some 30 years, he has been the author of numerous books of =20
poetry and of a video, "Poker Blues" (made in collaboration with Les =20
Levine), in which he also appears as the sole performer.


**Larry Ochs
http://www.ochs.cc
http://www.rova.org

A founding member of Rova, the saxophone quartet, Ochs has created =20

HI Tenney,

amidst the clamor i would advocate for the one we have here.

Cathy Wagner, myself, William R. Howe, Keith Tuma all in and around
it on the "poetry" side.
We get students working on their own projects much more than any
other school, i venture.
There is a very lively extending community, readings are well
attended (usually 100 plus)
good sprints (Tom Raworth, Bernadette Mayer, Rae Armantrout most
recently). An emphasis
on diverse performance in production and diverse performance in
circulation. Some
international and cross-cultural perspectives strongly in play.
Evidence of work in and
around the program can be witness via "meshworks"

http://www.orgs.muohio.edu/meshworks/

lots more i can say, including we have stellar ex-students making waves.

love and looking forwards

cris

"once upon a time, way way back in October 1994, rob mclennan & James
Spyker invented a two-day event called the ottawa small press book fair,
and held the first one at the National Archives of Canada..." Spyker moved
to Toronto soon after the first one, but the fair continues, thanks in
part to the help of generous volunteers, various writers and publishers,

address, email, web address, contact person, type of publications, list of
publications (with price), if submissions are being considered & any other
pertinent info, including upcoming ottawa-area events (if any). also, due
to the increased demand for table space, exhibitors are asked to confirm
far earlier than usual. i.e. -- before, say, the day of the fair.

the fair usually contains exhibitors with poetry books, novels, cookbooks,
posters, t-shirts, graphic novels, comic books, magazines, scraps of
paper, gum-ball machines with poems, 2x4s with text, etc, including (at

Celebrating Charles Darwin's 200th birthday with a mug of locally
distilled grappa, I notice pigeons, monkeys and cockroaches pursuing
their naturally occurring free markets in my backyard. They have set
up little shopping malls, which are a damn nuisance because they clog
up the lawnmower. A colony of ants run a thriving stock exchange made
out of sugar cubes, although it burned down in recent bushfires. They
put out minature newspapers saying: We Will Rebuild! and have declared
war on a neighbouring colony of bull ants in order to generate some
revenue. Meanwhile, lively trading of worms and nesting material goes
on between possums and magpies in the park down the road, with much
fluctuation in their currencies (gumnuts and possum poo). It's a
beautiful thing and my heart sings with its perfect naturalness.

Have to agree with Alan here. Lots of terrific artists barely making
it, or not making it. Not that one should romanticize "the starving
artist," but it is not a "myth" and should not be ridiculed. I think
there will be contemporary artists (including poets, visual artists,
musicians, composers, etc.) who will be seen, in decades to come, to
have contributed "to the development of the art form" they work in,
but whose contribution won't be noticed in a way that helps them
materially in their lifetime.

I agree with Alan.  Not all artists, even world-class ones, are good at
marketing themselves.  Look at Kevin Connolly!  If not for chance meetings
with Andy Warhol and a few other people, Jean-Michel Basquiat might well
have perished on the street, unrecognized.  I know musicians who barely
manage to scrape by who have better chops than 80% of those making a
full-time living at their craft.  "The Market" does not recognize talent.
It recognizes merchantability.

While what you say is valid, we also cannot become so cynical that we deny many worthy people the possible support they need to pursue their art. I commend your efforts and am interested in reading more about your organization. Perhaps I am imbued with a sense of hope at this very low point in so many areas in this country and in my ideal (and albeit perhaps unrealistic) world, I see a government supporting the one thing as I stated in another post might speak to our common humanity. Besides, who is to say that a privately funded organization might not become the very thing you say governments that is institutes of power? I currently live in a very small minded community where the arts are often privately funded and the myopic view of the people who hold the purse seems to be no better than if a government agency held those same funds. I often wonder how the public voluntarily supports these folks since prices for arts events in my community are so high, the average person ma

 only be able to attend one or two events per year. Where I come from, because the artists are subsidized by the government, ordinary people have better access to the arts. This is a very complicated question the more I about it. I do not think there are any easy answers.

>As someone whose family were artists in WWII Europe, I would think you would be most wary of government promises and government-sponsored or "supported" art. Government has never done anything out goodness or purity of motives. It is always tied up with power. Perhaps in some ideal world we could have what you want. But nowhere in the real world has it ever happened. The real results in the real world have never been good for the arts.

The idea is that the people can voluntarily patronize the arts through us. Anyone who is serious about the public patronizing the arts -- freely and not by force -- should be supporting what we are doing.

I am very much aware of those people whose work was not state sponsered as being artists.

And forgive me, but my breath of what I consider to be the arts is vast.

That is what the arts should do and that which does not do this but passes itself as art is merely what Joyce said is pornagraphy.

>>Oh, so only artists who get grants are true artists. And, from the sounds of things, only those who get government grants. Nice to know that that's how you define an artist. I guess you leave out those who don't get grants and who get into galleries or get published. I suppose you leave out all those people in film, including screenplay writers, those involved in plays operas, musicals, the many musicians out there, etc. The arts are wildly successful in this country -- but only if we include the successful ones in our definition of what an artist is -- meaning, those who don't need government grants.

So many artists cannot BE ARTISTS because there is simply no support.

Apparently you have not lived with a jazz musician who was a renowned one. Your remark was rather trite...one does not necessarily think of this when one thinks of a poor artist. There were many artists who managed to live well before and after Van Gogh (someone I do admire by the way). You also live in an area that is not as economically depressed as mine is. This kind of remark is simply not helpful in a discussion as important this one is.......

I think we can be pretty sure that that propagandized guy has never
heard Giuseppi Logan.
Logan lived a lot of years in Northern Europe.
He was wise to it.
He is also a great musician.
The "free" market didnt work for him,
though it works for undressed teenagers who can't play music.

Celebrating Charles Darwin's 200th birthday with a mug of locally
distilled grappa, I notice pigeons, monkeys and cockroaches pursuing
their naturally occurring free markets in my backyard. They have set
up little shopping malls, which are a damn nuisance because they clog
up the lawnmower. A colony of ants run a thriving stock exchange made
out of sugar cubes, although it burned down in recent bushfires. They
put out minature newspapers saying: We Will Rebuild! and have declared
war on a neighbouring colony of bull ants in order to generate some
revenue. Meanwhile, lively trading of worms and nesting material goes
on between possums and magpies in the park down the road, with much
fluctuation in their currencies (gumnuts and possum poo). It's a
beautiful thing and my heart sings with its perfect naturalness.

For me, it's not a question of denying anyone anything. The problem you are pointing out is the problem of monopoly. This is one of the reasons for my opposition to government funding -- there is the tendency, when the government funds anything, for them to monopolize it. But this can happen locally, too, with private organizations and private funding. The difference is that in the private sector, one can develop competing institutions, while the government has a very strong tendency to drive out competitors. Another reason I support private over public funding is the issue of voluntary action. Should someone be made to support something they do not like and do not agree with? When you take tax dollars from someone and use it to support a particular artist and their works, you could be making someone who finds the work distasteful support it. In the private sector, if you like it, support it. If you don't, don't. I do think there is a valid aspect of
 government funding that I think could be better done by private organizations such as mine, which is the issue of democratic patronage. While I do not think people should be forced to patronize the arts (and if you don't think you're forced, just don't pay your taxes and see what happens to you), I think people should be given the opportunity to do so. Much of what is available is the ability to donate to the opera house, the ballet, etc. -- but these are large, public organizations that more often than not are professionally run and do traditional works. Which is fine. We need those things. But what about new artists producing new works? There don't seem to be many available avenues for people to patronize new artists and support new works (here, the government typically falls far short too, not wanting to take any risks). Admittedly, the Emerson Institute does support a particular world view and thus will support artists who create works within that
 world view. There's nothing wrong with that. Choices must be made, no matter how much money one has available (which is nothing for us right now). The great thing about the private sector, though, is that if someone wants to allow people to freely patronize some other form of art or art created in and with a particular world view, then they can certainly do so. The more, the merrier, I say. Competition improves the product, no matter what that product may be.

So in the end, yes, it is a more complex issue than anyone has admitted to so far here. I want to create a place in the Emerson Institute where people can develop as artists -- literally, if I can get the money. Part of the dream of the Emerson Institute is an artist/writers colony where people are brought in to wrk and show their works, do readings, attend talks, and get paid for it. Admittedly, that's a long way off, but it will never be achieved without the goal being set. I want nothing more than a renaissance and an arts-based economy. And I want the Emerson Institute to be a founding institution of that new economy. All of economy history shows that that will become a reality only if the government gets out of the way.

While what you say is valid, we also cannot become so cynical that we deny many worthy people the possible support they need to pursue their art. I commend your efforts and am interested in reading more about your organization. Perhaps I am imbued with a sense of hope at this very low point in so many areas in this country and in my ideal (and albeit perhaps unrealistic) world, I see a government supporting the one thing as I stated in another post might speak to our common humanity. Besides, who is to say that a privately funded organization might not become the very thing you say governments that is institutes of power? I currently live in a very small minded community where the arts are often privately funded and the myopic view of the people who hold the purse seems to be no better than if a government agency held those same funds. I often wonder how the public voluntarily supports these folks since prices for arts events in my community are so high,
 the average person ma

only be able to attend one or two events per year. Where I come from, because the artists are subsidized by the government, ordinary people have better access to the arts. This is a very complicated question the more I about it. I do not think there are any easy answers.

Good stuff. But why stop at math? I explain, at great length (but in reverse order, so you have to start at the bottom and read backwards) how the arts, including poetry, are a more complex reflection of the fundamental nature of the universe.

Neither does the government recognize talent. The market is much more likely to do so. Even more likely are people educated in the arts who have the money to patronize the arts. Even more likely are private institutions and organizations run by those who can recognize talent who collect private funds to patronize the arts.

I agree with Alan.  Not all artists, even world-class ones, are good at marketing themselves.  Look at Kevin Connolly!  If not for chance meetings with Andy Warhol and a few other people, Jean-Michel Basquiat might well have perished on the street, unrecognized.  I know musicians who barely manage to scrape by who have better chops than 80% of those making a full-time living at their craft.  "The Market" does not recognize talent. It recognizes merchantability.

Though 90%+ of artists who sell still need to supplement their sales by teaching--though that vocation does have its perks.

>>> Precisely the opposite here...so many who are considered "artists" are simply NOT and we should blithely pretend that they are? I am very much aware of those people whose work was not state sponsered as being artists. Some artists are forunate enough not to need government support, bbut there are so many who might continue to work if they did have support. And forgive me, but my breath of what I consider to be the arts is vast. Nonetheless, it would be appropriate and just to support people who are devoted artists...people who eat, sleep and breathe their art despite the sacrifice to do so. So much of what people in this country call art is tied to economy. It is what sells. I think about the great artists whose devotion to the expression of that something inside, something that is inspired because the heart was open to the possibility of being and because they could not survive in a world that places too much emphasis on monetary outcomes compels me

Support so that perhaps they might find their humanity in the aftermath of so much inhumanity. And yes perhaps there are no perfect agencies-that is to say in this particular case, one that would be fair and just (and YES I do believe that these are viable attributes and I am not a REPUBLICAN nor a DEMOCRAT nor an INDEPENDENT)but I still believe in my ideal world that the arts should be supported not by the government but rather through it. The government's only vested interest should be one that fosters free expression as a means of allowing its artists to be the voice of its people. That is what the arts should do and that which does not do this but passes itself as art is merely what Joyce said is pornagraphy.

Azure Carter's blog: http://thedonkeyskin.blogspot.com

From Azure -


I've recently started a blog (http://thedonkeyskin.blogspot.com), so I can
have a space to share some completed projects and works-in-progress with
family, friends, and interested parties.  This includes songs, writings,
performances, costumes, videos, etc.

If you like Alan's work, my site offers another view on our collabora-
tions.  If you enjoy my songs, I've got links to them and lyrics and
explanatory notes.  I'm also posting about a video I am currently working
on based on the nature writings of Opal Whiteley, which is part nature
guide, part fairytale.  Future projects in development deal the Regency
clown Grimaldi and Pierrot, and the genres of psychological horror and/or
Gothic fiction.

Feel free to visit and hopefully you'll find something of interest.

Uh, sorry, Mr. Camplin, slavery is perfectly compatible with the free market and indeed helped create it -- one can engage in free trade OF enslaved peoples and there was quite a lot of competition back in the slavetrading days.  There's your natural classicism -- Thomas Jefferson looking out from his Palladian, pseudo-Greek big house (built by slave labor), watching the forced labor (his property, which for you is an inalienable right).  In fact, those Southern slaveowners who read at all were fond of comparing themselves to the ancient Greeks (who had a little business going with domestic slavery and mine-laborers).  Natural classicists, every one of them, to a man!  How about prison labor nowadays, Mr. Camplin.  Seems to me you've got a lot of those in Texas; indeed, I bet the desks and blue-books in your "Institute" were made by prison labor.  Oh, and if you want to note the connections of Nazi death camps to free-market economics, check out the chapter "This Side of Good
 and Evil" from Primo Levi's "If This Is a Man."  But then again, Levi was a partisan with a socialist resistance group during World War II, so clearly, by your lights, he was worse than his captors because he explicitly wanted to bring back chattel slavery.

Hard to talk with free-market fanatics, who bow down to Mammon, call it a "naturally occurring system" (like viruses), and rant about government financing of the arts without devoting one word to government financing of incomparably more destructive institutions like the Defense Departmen.  Henceforth I will cease and desist where you are concerned, Mr. Camplin, and leave you to your blinkered ideological complacency, your "Thoughts of Chairman Frederick," and your plantation ideology of natural classicism.

 I could be convinced that the actions of actors inside the free market is
"naturally occurring," but that's not what we were talking about. We were
talking about the market itself.

The market, whether it is communist, socialist or absolutely laissez-faire
operates within parameters defined by the government. That is one of the
major roles of government. It doesn't "naturally occur." To claim that it
naturally occurs would mean that it operates independently of government and
would hence be ideological.

So perhaps your response post is based on a misunderstanding. Perhaps when
you said "Naturally-occurring" you really meant that it "occurs naturally,"
which would still be less than perfect but more in line with what you were
going on about in your response.

*Duncan/Levertov & The War Now-*Panel, Open Forum, Reading &
Reception*Saturday, February 28, 2009
*
@ Woodland Pattern Book Center 720 E Locust St. Milwaukee WI 53212

*How should artists as citizens respond to war? What response is possible
beyond protest?*

Over the course of their decades-long friendship, Devinse Levertov and
Robert Duncan wrote passionately and eloquently about their writing and
revision processes. During the years of the Vietnam war, however, their
once-close friendship began to show signs of strain. Their diverging views
on how to respond to in the face of that war ultimately caused the
friendship to founder. In 2006 a group of poets and Woodland Pattern
community members starting meeting regulary to read and discuss the decades
long correspondence between Duncan and Levertov. Our reading group then
became a poetic "research" group leading to The War Now forum. Looking at
the lessons drawn from the dissolution of friendship between Robert Duncan
and Denise Levertov, we hope to promote further conversations and
collaborations among artists, scholars, and activists about the role that
literary texts play in disseminating information in war-time. The schedule
for the day will include a panel session followed by an open forum. The
event will close with forum participants joining John Balaban in a group
reading in the evening.

*The War Now** 2:00 Panel*: Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, and The War Now
Panelists (Ed Block, Faith Barrett, Karl Gartung, Andrew Graff, Dale
Ritterbusch, and John Balaban) will consider what lessons artists can draw
from the correspondence between Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov, two poets
with deeply considered responses to the war(s) of their time. To what extent
can literary texts represent the horrors of battlefield violence and should
writers try to do so? In what ways might poetry be particularly well-suited
to the task of representing war, and what ways might it be a particularly
limiting or confining form of representation? Does an artist have a
responsibility to register some artistic "truth" or to persuade? What is a
"just" response? Is it possible, being human, to respond to events both
contemporaneously and justly?

Each panelist will offer 3-5 minutes of prepared remarks, with presenters
responding to one another as well as raising further questions for the
audience members and panelists to discuss.

*3:00 Open Forum* with Paul Lacey: Participants include Peter O'Leary,
Anne-Marie Cusac, Angela Sorby, John Balaban, Ed Block, Faith Barrett, Karl
Gartung, Andrew Graff, Dale Ritterbusch, Chuck Stebelton, Peggy Hong,

members.

*7:00 Reading & Reception*: Forum participants will join John Balaban in a
group poetry reading at 7pm. Each poet will present a short set of their own
writing in addition to sharing work that relates to the Duncan-Levertov
debate or a poem from the tradition of war writing. $8 / $7 /$6

Thursday, February 19, 2009 - 7PM
CRG Gallery 535 West 22nd Street



Jo=E3o Enxuto and Danny Snelson will organize selections from the streaming
video archives of the www.ubuweb.com/film website as a means to momentarily
"clothe and house" classic avant-garde film and video works. This
performance will investigate the characteristics of online versions of
media-reflexive works. Through live projections and interventions, the
curators will reprogram works designed to address mediums now teetering at
the edge of obsolescence.

No. I was responding to the person saying that her family was from Europe. The phrase "As someone whose family were artists in WWII Europe" refers to "you" in the sentence (the "you" was cut off). My family has lived in Kentucky in poverty until my father's generation worked their way out of it.

This is pathetic. It demonstrates at best (if I am to be generous with your intentions) ignorance of what "natural classicism" is, what "natural" means, what free markets are, the nature of slavery, the history of economics and of humans in general, and the fact that "Nazi" is short for "National Socialist". The Nazis were socialists, not supporters of the free market.

One of the few proper roles of the government is protection against force. Now, we can certainly have a discussion about whether this or that military action actually fulfills that role (our action in Afghanistan, yes; our action in Iraq, no), but national defense is actually something the government is supposed to do and is designed to do well.

What I don't understand is how everyone here can seem to recognize corruption, abuse of power and money, etc. when it comes to rich CEO's, but cannot see the corruption, abuse of power and money, etc. when it comes to rich government officials. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that you don't like the fact that the CEO is rich from having engaged in trade with you, but you do like the fact that the politician is rich from having forcibly taken your money from you. You support what amounts to theft (try to do the same thing as the government and see what happens to you; also, try not to pay your taxes, and see what happens to you); I support free exchange between cooperating, free people. My world view is deeply, inherently opposed to slavery; yours creates slavery. I'm sorry you're so blind you can't see that.

Uh, sorry, Mr. Camplin, slavery is perfectly compatible with the free market and indeed helped create it -- one can engage in free trade OF enslaved peoples and there was quite a lot of competition back in the slavetrading days.  There's your natural classicism -- Thomas Jefferson looking out from his Palladian, pseudo-Greek big house (built by slave labor), watching the forced labor (his property, which for you is an inalienable right).  In fact, those Southern slaveowners who read at all were fond of comparing themselves to the ancient Greeks (who had a little business going with domestic slavery and mine-laborers).  Natural classicists, every one of them, to a man!  How about prison labor nowadays, Mr. Camplin.  Seems to me you've got a lot of those in Texas; indeed, I bet the desks and blue-books in your "Institute" were made by prison labor.  Oh, and if you want to note the connections of Nazi death camps to free-market economics, check out the
 chapter "This Side of Good
and Evil" from Primo Levi's "If This Is a Man."  But then again, Levi was a partisan with a socialist resistance group during World War II, so clearly, by your lights, he was worse than his captors because he explicitly wanted to bring back chattel slavery.

Hard to talk with free-market fanatics, who bow down to Mammon, call it a "naturally occurring system" (like viruses), and rant about government financing of the arts without devoting one word to government financing of incomparably more destructive institutions like the Defense Departmen.  Henceforth I will cease and desist where you are concerned, Mr. Camplin, and leave you to your blinkered ideological complacency, your "Thoughts of Chairman Frederick," and your plantation ideology of natural classicism.

Here's a streaming video of a presentation I gave in Vancouver on Feb 12:
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/video/vantalk

The presentation is on dbCinema, a graphic synthesizer I'm writing in
Director, and on Jig-Sound, an interactive audio app I'm writing. There's
more info on both these apps at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm
and
http://vispo.com/jig

The talk was at The Centre for Digital Media, which is a new school, a joint
effort between some schools in Vancouver (UBC, SFU, BCIT, and Emily Carr).
They run a masters program in digital media.

When Lisa Jarnot heard Thomas Meyer read his new work in Hickory last fall, she said simply "That's a great poem".This week Meyer, author of At Dusk Iridescent, The Bang Book, Staves Calends Legends, Sappho's Raft, and Coromandel, among other titles, translator of the daodejing, reads that new work on Wordplay.

I attended California College of the Arts as a graduate student and
not as an undergraduate, but I can attest that the school has an
astoundingly generous and talented faculty for their Writing program.
The opportunities the school provides for Writing students to try out
other artistic disciplines helped open up the writing of a number of
graduate students, and I'm sure it's the same case for undergraduates.

Some 10,000 US arts institutions have disappeared or are
close to ending their operations. This represents about 10
percent of the total, and the economic crisis is only a few
months old! Arts organizations in the West are especially
vulnerable because so many in recent years have come to rely
on insider government subsidies, corporate largesse or the
contributions of wealthy conspirators. Aside from the
inevitable ideological limitations this placed on arts
groups, this corrupt relationship tied the latter to the
fate of the stock market and the wider economy. Good
riddance and happy days!

No, the sentence went this way: "As someone whose family were artists
in WWII Europe, I would think . . .. "


That is an "I", not a "you". The phrase modifies the pronoun that
then becomes the subject of the sentence.

Unless grammar is a matter of the "free" market---

One can always point to people who in your opinion (and, with this list, mine) are at best embarrassing. However, one can also point to the fact that Picasso, Monet, and Jasper Johns were all made wealthy during their lifetimes. I may not like Britney Spears, but I'm also not going to deprive anyone of her, either, if that's what they like. If you want to try to educate people to have better taste, that's fine and good -- but there's no evidence the government is good at educating people in math and reading, let alone good taste. I love how you people have to purposefully ignore facts to make your points. Throw up a few straw men (and women, in this case) to try to make a "point."

Indeed, let me clarify further. It is the actions of actors who create the phenomenon known as the free market. The market is an emergent system that arises out of the various interactions of those various actors. The role of the government thus becomes: are the rules that arise out of free exchange between actors recognized and accepted, or not? One can recognize the elements that facilitate free exchange between people and reinforce them with laws or thwart them with laws. Thus can a government facilitate what occurs naturally, or prevent such interactions. If one had a law that simply stated that when you enter into an agreement with someone to do something, you have to abide by that agreement, or face certain consequences for breaking the contract, then that is simply a codification of a natural social behavior. In a very small community, where everyone knows everybody else, social pressures can keep things on a handshake-only basis. Codification of
 the handshake-agreement into a contract allows you to make more agreements with more people, including strangers. In other words, it opens up the close-knit community to allow it to become a much larger community. Is this ideological? Not in and of itself. It becomes ideological when the government goes a step further and says that this or that kind of contract, between these or those people are not allowed. For example, the 1964 Civil Rights Act primarily overthrew state laws that prevented certain kinds of contracts from being entered into -- whether those contracts were literal contracts, or implied contracts. An implied contract would be a rule about where people could sit on a bus. It was actually a state law that said African-Americans had to sit in the back of the bus. This should clue you in to something. If there is a law against it, that means people would likely do the thing the law is preventing them from doing. In this case, the law
 prevented a bus company from letting people sit wherever they wanted to if they wanted to. All you need is one bus company deciding they wanted to get more African-American riders to make more money, and that bus line would let African-Americans sit wherever they wanted to sit. It was the ideology of racism that prevented that from happening. Admittedly, the Civil Rights Act went a bit further than merely allowing the markets to work, going on to say that another set of contracts could not be entered into, but I would venture to say that even those restrictions are no longer necessary, having worked to correct the problem quite well. Besides, anyone who would engage in contractual racism deserves to have their company boycotted against.

I could be convinced that the actions of actors inside the free market is
"naturally occurring," but that's not what we were talking about. We were
talking about the market itself.

The market, whether it is communist, socialist or absolutely laissez-faire
operates within parameters defined by the government. That is one of the
major roles of government. It doesn't "naturally occur." To claim that it
naturally occurs would mean that it operates independently of government and
would hence be ideological.

So perhaps your response post is based on a misunderstanding. Perhaps when
you said "Naturally-occurring" you really meant that it "occurs naturally,"
which would still be less than perfect but more in line with what you were
going on about in your response.

Twitter's Evil Plot to Destroy the English Language

Every communication medium, from the telegraph to instant messaging, =20
develops its own peculiar lingo. But the lingo of Twitter, the status-=20=

updating tool which has infected Internet hipsters, media types, and =20
Hollywood, is ahistorically vile.

There's a simple algorithm for making up new Twitter words: Take an =20
existing word and defile it by changing the initial consonant to "tw." =20=

Here are just a few examples:

* Twirting. Flirting on Twitter, an activity popularized by former =20
Valleywag editor Nick Douglas.
* Tweeps. Twitter peeps, or friends. Seemingly intelligent people like =20=

Air America radio hostess Ana Marie Cox use this in an apparently =20
unironic manner.
* Twisticuffs. A fight between Twitter users.

It just gets worse from there. But the single most horrible Twitter =20
word is surely "twebinar," which is a Web seminar =97 "webinar" =97 =20
conducted over Twitter. Twanks, but no twanks.=

[Write messages in support of the NYU student protesters to: john.sexton@ nyu.edu, jhb5@nyu.edu, provost@nyu. edu, evp@nyu.edu]




New York City Labor Against the War denounces the NYU administration's attack on student protesters of Take Back NYU.

The students demand that the university serve its student body through financial transparency and accountability.




They
demand that the administration recognize the Graduate Student
Organizing Committee/UAW Local 2110, and agree to fair labor contracts
for all university employees.

They are particularly courageous
in calling on NYU to support the people of Gaza and end University
complicity with the Israeli apartheid regime -- demands that parallel
recent student protests at the University of Rochester, Hampshire
College, and two dozen universities through the UK.

When the
administration arrogantly ignored these concerns, protesters
nonviolently occupied their student center, a direct action in the
tradition of the civil rights, Vietnam antiwar and anti-apartheid
movements.

The administration's response has been typically deceitful and vindictive.

It
called in the NYPD to attack protest rallies outside the building. It
falsely agreed to negotiate, only to detain the students'
representatives. It forcibly removed other protesters -- some of whom
were assaulted by NYU security, and at least one of whom was arrested.
It suspended eighteen protesters and evicted them from university
residences.

We are proud of these students' protest and refusal to be silenced. NYU administration must immediately:

1. Rescind suspensions, dorm evictions and all other disciplinary action.

2. Drop all criminal charges.




3. Meet the students' demands.

Methinks the phrase modifies the verb of the clause that follows it.

STAN APPS and KAREEM ESTEFAN
POETRY PROJECT
MONDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 8 PM

STAN APPS and RUSSELL REED present "Princess of the World in Love," a
song-cycle adapted from the book of the same name. Previous collaborations
include "Oracular Vagina Takes Her Place Among World Leaders" (a series of
operatic skits) and "The Book Beneath the Covers" (poems and drawings,
unpublished). Stan Apps is a poet and essayist living in Los Angeles. His
books of poems include soft hands (Ugly Duckling Presse), Princess of the
World in Love (Cy Press), Info Ration (Make Now Press) and God's Livestock
Policy (Les Figues Press). A collection of essays is underway from Combo
Books. Stan co-curates the Smell Last Sunday of the Month reading series and
assistant curates The Ups and Downs, a short-term art installation series.
Dr. RUSSELL REED attended Baylor University and The University of Texas at
Austin where he received his D.M.A in composition in 2005. While attending
The University of Texas, he studied composition with Dan Welcher and Donald
Grantham and served as the assistant director of The New Music Ensemble.
Since graduating, Dr. Reed has received many notable honors and performances
including a state sponsored performance and exhibition at the historic home
of Alexander Scriabin in Moscow. In October of 2007 he premiered several of
his new works for piano in recital in Monterrey, Mexico. Dr. Reed resides in
Austin.

KAREEM ESTEFAN's writing has appeared in President's Choice, Rain Taxi,
Sustainable Aircraft, and Boog City. From October 2007 to October 2008, he
hosted Ceptuetics, a weekly radio reading/interview series for conceptually
innovative poetry, which is archived at PennSound.

Perhaps, the English language is just a raw material from which "inventors"
could create their "para-languages."

One
can always point to people who in your opinion (and, with this list,
mine) are at best embarrassing. However, one can also point to the fact
that Picasso, Monet, and Jasper Johns were all made wealthy during
their lifetimes. I may not like Britney Spears, but I'm also not going
to deprive anyone of her, either, if that's what they like. If you want
to try to educate people to have better taste, that's fine and good --
but there's no evidence the government is good at educating people in
math and reading, let alone good taste. I love how you people have to
purposefully ignore facts to make your points. Throw up a few straw men
(and women, in this case) to try to make a "point."

I prefer the phrase "People of Straw" but I don't use the market as any
guide to quality in the arts. In fact, the opposite may be true, but
when you're a fundamentalist, you say funny things, eh?

I don't think so. There is no adverb in the phrase.

This contention about the "vile" nature of Twitter lingo--all those neologi=
sms beginning with "tw"--is very interesting to me because I've often tried=
 to figure out why "tween", meaning kids roughly between the ages of eight =
and twelve, has seemed to me just about the ugliest word I've ever encounte=
red. I know I don't like this recently invented word because it newly frame=
s a stage of life--a vulnerable and tender stage, at that--for purposes of =
Marketing. But I've sometimes wondered if there is something about the *sou=
nd* of the word "tween" that is off-putting. But I can't say I'm disturbed =
to hear the sounds "twist", "twenty", "twelve", "tweet", or the very close =
"twin".

But it could be that when one has another reason to hate a word that the pr=
esence of the "tw" sound, or of any "w" in a consonant cluster,  magnifies =
the repulsion. And this may be because the "w" sounds like a frustrated att=
empt to pronounce an "r", in the manner of cartoon character Elmer Fudd twu=
sting that this time he'll catch the wabbit.    =20

Context is important to understand meaning as well. Knowing the context helps to understand the referent. I'm not saying it was a good sentence -- a good sentence would have read, "As someone whose family were artists in WWII Europe, you . . . , I would think." -- but the referent is in fact clear in context of the discussion. It also helps when you don't conveniently cut off the rest of the sentence, thus eliminating context further.

There's no accounting for taste. Doesn't mean the government should step in and make them take it, though. Send stuff to places that are actually interested in your stuff. Don't force it on people. That's all I'm saying. "Government is not persuasion, it is force." -- George Washington

It's interesting that many of the countries that advertise being Republics or Democracies in their names aren't. I am equally suspicious of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, as neither actually seem to be in favor of either democracy or republican government.

But the national socialists were in fact socialists. If you knew anything about socialism, you would know that to be true. Socialist countries as a whole don't have a great track record. Unless you think hundreds of millions of people being killed just because they don't fit into the socialist utopia is in fact a good idea. I suppose now you'll make some sort of ahistorical, Marxist interpretation of history that will lead you claim that capitalism killed even more people through this or that indirect means, or wars, or some such nonsense. Such arguments from you people are so incredibly predictable -- only there's no evidence at all in your case, while I can point to the mass graves and the gulags in mine. Nobody wants to deal with the realities of socialism as actually practiced in the real world, but only deal with Marxist fantasies. It really is like trying to talk to Intelligent Designers. You can't.

In the course of The First 100 Days of President Obama, (haptics and reflec=
tive commentary), I am often at poetry readings and panels. A 'taste', or g=
o direct to the blog at http://stephenvincent.net/blog/

Last night we in San Francisco had an invasion of two Canadian
poets: Rachel Zolf (by way of New York), and Christian Bok. Unlike this
past week=92s meeting of President Obama and Canada=92s Prime Minister - in
which the advertised Obama intention was to give reassurances
to our northern neighbor that a =93Buy American=94 agenda will not destroy
Canada=92s economy - Bok and Zolf were enthusiastically received as poets
with much strong work to offer the local poetry economy that
is the audience of primarily poets in the Small Press Traffic audience.
It was an intense evening that also partied late into the night at The Righ=
t Spot, the night club Bar at the corner of 17h & Folsom.
=09There
is not time or space to blog on at length here. But. first off, Rachel
Zolf=92s work cuts right across the spectrum that constitutes coping with
the internal contradictions of being Jewish and confronting Israel=92s
occupation, if not already the start of the decimation and/or removal
of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. =93De-Arabization=94 was her
short hand for what has been initiated in Gaza. Or, to point in the
opposite direction, in =93a priori=94, the opening poem, from a series
conditional propositions she asks,

If Israel is not in Israel

As if not to dispose of the idea of Israel as a spiritual home &
refuge, but to pose the idea that concept of Israel is not
=91geo-dependent=92 but one with a fluid sense of location, and/or that its
current geographic location is actually a counter-Israel.
=09The poem is from a beautifully produced new chapbook Shoot and Weep ,
(Nomados: Vancouver). Her language moves with the stinging velocity of
a counter-Biblical, righteous sense of query, one that strips bare the
=91wire=92 filled on-the-ground reality of asymmetrical moral and physical
violence.=20
=09If the Sabbath is a form of constraint

If jihad is the firt word learn to spell

If Elie Wiesel is the Holocaust

If must expropriate gently

If messianism licks at the edge of thought

If the truth does not lie in silence

If naf means self and brother

If the space between words can be bridged

If moderate physical pressure is acceptable=85
=09Zolf=92s language embraces, explores and is torn by the contradictions o=
f the condition called Israel It=92s brave and fearless work.

This work, among others in her reading, was part of other works that
embed themselves in the =91data=92 condition of being global, corporate and
modern. A person who has not yet chose an academic career, she has
clearly worked as a writer in the =91technical & training manual
bowels=92 of the corporate world. The poems navigate a space in which
numbers co-opt words as transmitters of knowledge. It=92s a space in
which a human, bodily and psychological presence is not acknowledged.
The poems wrestle, for example, with the numerical negations of
sexuality, gender and difference. As so much begins to unravel - the
demolition of the global Economy, including more and more Failed States - Z=
olf=92s language - moving with the parodic speed of a computer computation =
-  invokes  the texture of an increasing world enfolding anxiety.
In the manner of an Oppen vision, the poems read/perform as signals,
the words and histories resisting and flashing on and off as from
lights of shipwreck.....(On to Christian Bok)

Please change your bookmarks to the new address, =

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

(Please post: The notes are relevant to Poetics and Odyssey is going down
in a few days - thanks, Alan)



Notes on e-poetry for an online seminar at De Montfort University 2/23


If you go to http://www.alansondheim.org/howard/ you'll see the materials
I used - the talk was on e-poetry and virtual worlds. (Please note there
are references to the Odyssey show; again, it's only up for a few more
days - please check out http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 .)


the virtual, writing, inscription: intertwined dynamics, presencing,
virtual and material strata

the linearity of writing melds with the passing of time, constructs the
diegesis and the inhabiting of a text.

hypertext jumps you in and out of choice / reading and I think as a result
is problematic - you're making choices within a production of the text,
but you're taken out of the text to make the choices.

in virtual worlds, moving creates the dynamics of choice so that you're
seeing or hearing signposts and signs, as if within the word, within the
world, not within / without / within / etc.

in virtual worlds, languaging appears always dynamic and in any number of
modes - it's the pleasure of the living text (to the extent that anything
lives or survives in the virtual).

so there's a power and an incredible simplicity in working in Second Life
for example - the database and software does almost all the work for you.

the next steps are portals - productions between virtual worlds or sectors
of virtual worlds or real worlds; eventually all sorts of intrusions will
be possible.

there are also behavioral signs. if you look at sprayed1 or swirl or
vortices or writingmachine or kanji in the /howard/ directory, you'll see
all sorts of ways for writing in the sky. these use either intrinsic
motions scripted for objects, or extrinsic animation files scripted for
avatars. the animation files come from altered motion capture files.

most of the image files in the /howard/ directory contain texts attached
to objects. if you look at slscript.txt you'll see how these are done.

For the most recent texts, look in /howard/ at recent.txt - this contains
my 'pertinent' writings from the last 2-3 weeks; for some of them I used
the chat at DMU or chat within Second Life, as a compositional structure.

Subject: Open Letter on Academic Freedom

As members of the academic community, we are deeply saddened by the stateme=
nts made by State Representatives Charlice Byrd and Calvin Hill (R-Georgia)=
, which were reported on by CNN on February 18, 2009 (see: http://www.cnn.c=
om/video/#/video/living/2009/02/18/am.costello.teaching.sex.cnn). Both legi=
slators, supported by the Christian Coalition, have declared their oppositi=
on to the teaching of queer theory, sexuality, and similar subjects on mora=
l grounds, arguing that these courses should be cut because they are a wast=
e of taxpayer money.

Granted, lawmakers are entitled to their opinion; the first amendment guara=
ntees their right to express it freely. However, representatives Byrd, Hill=
 and their supporters demonstrate a complete disregard and lack of understa=
nding of the fundamental mission of a university.

The principle of Academic Freedom helps define our roles and responsibiliti=
es as members of the university community. Individually and collectively, t=
hrough our teaching and scholarship, we encourage our students to search an=
d discover knowledge. Academic freedom protects us and our rights to conduc=
t research, to publish and to freely discuss ideas that are relevant to our=
 fields of study. The principle, as defined by the American Association of =
University Professors, also recognizes our rights, as citizens, to free exp=
ression of our opinions, which should not be restricted by the institution.=
 At the same time, we are reminded of our special obligations to our studen=
ts, and to the community. Hence, we are urged to "exercise proper restraint=
", to avoid controversies that have no bearing to our subject matter, to re=
spect the opinions of others, and "to make every effort to indicate that th=
ey are not speaking for the institution" for which we work (AAUP,
  1940).

We believe that classrooms are spaces to discuss ideas. A well-rounded educ=
ation, furthermore, is not just about learning practical skills; it should =
help students develop their ability to think critically, and to engage and =
question their surroundings, their culture, their government, and even thei=
r religious beliefs. If they can come out on the other side with deeper con=
victions, either those they held before or new ones they have embraced, the=
n we can say that it was all worth it. The grading, the uninspired students=
, the incomprehensible committee jargon... all of it.

Still, it saddens us that lawmakers in Georgia find so much to object about=
, and that they use their position as a bully pulpit. They obviously don't =
understand that queer theory, for example, is not meant as an attempt to re=
cruit new "queers"; it is a useful tool to understand society and culture f=
rom the point of view of a group that has always been on the outside lookin=
g in. We can only hope that most of the students to come out of such a cour=
se would be better equipped to handle themselves in a diverse world than le=
gislators Byrd and Hill are.

We support our colleagues and appreciate the freedom to share knowledge, an=
d we encourage everyone who shares these sentiments to sign our online peti=
tion, available at http://www.petitiononline.com/MDIA/petition.html, and/or=
 join our Facebook group at http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=3D5532410=

Dear friends,

Next Saturday -- March 7th -- the incredible Lisa Robertson will read =20=

at Moe's Books with Rae Armantrout. Two great readings from two =20
innovative writers.

At the event, Lisa Robertson will launch her brand-new title, Lisa =20
Robertson's Magenta Soul Whip (Coach House Books). Composed of =20
previously uncollected verses, essays, confessions, reports, =20
translations, drafts, treatises, laments and utopias from the past =20
fifteen years, Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul Whip presents a window =20=

into the workings of what The Village Voice calls the =91seductive =20
intellect=92 of one of today=92s most diverse and daring authors.

Robertson will read for a Berkeley audience at the launch of her =20
collection on Saturday, March 7, at historic Moe=92s Books. She reads =20=

with influential West Coast language poet Rae Armantrout, reading from =20=

Versed (Wesleyan).

About Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul Whip:

Lisa Robertson writes poems that mine the past =96 its ideas, its =20
personages, its syntax =96 to construct a lexicon of the future. Her =20
poems both court and cuckold subjectivity by unmasking its fundament =20
of sex and hesitancy, the coil of doubt in its certitude. Reading her =20=

laments and utopias, we realize that language =96 whiplike =96 casts =
ahead =20
of itself a fortuitous form. The form brims here pleasurably with =20
dogs, movie stars, broths, painting=92s detritus, Latin and pillage. =20
Erudite and startling, the poems in Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul =20
Whip, occasional works written over the past fifteen years collected =20
by Elisa Sampedrin, turn vestige into architecture, chagrin into =20
resplendence. In them, we recognize our grand, saddened century.

If you can't make the event, you can order Lisa Robertson's Magenta =20
Soul Whip from http://www.chbooks.com.


Praise for Lisa Robertson:

'Though Lucretius and other names of antiquity appear throughout the =20
searching, philosophical verse of Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul Whip, =20=

Robertson=92s sensibility =97 an exuberant, saucy approach to the =20
materiality of language and vice versa =97 is much more in step with =20
[George] Clinton than long-dead ascetics ... The self-contained nature =20=

of Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul Whip is just that good.' =96 Eye =
Weekly

=91For [Robertson] all things provoke acts of attention, and hospitable =20=

ones at that: sentences play around and about, on sidewalks or =20
ladders, in gardens and sheds, through strawberry patches, over and =20
under tentative city plans with which to relineate our own lives.=92 =96 =

For immediate release

Apopka Fl- On Tuesday March 3, at 7:30, First Tuedays is proud to present a poetic figure of great esteem. Randall Cadman would best be described as  one of those unrecognized writers, that write in relative obscurity, greatly underappreciated. Mr. Cadman has published a couple of books of poetry. A chapbbook, "Lunar Cycles," and a book of poems, "Bottles in the Sea". His verse is full of poignant rhymes and razor sharp wit. Please join us this Tuesday at The Daily Grind, 3060 S.R. 436. So we can enjoy, and pay tribute to this wonderful artist. An open mic will follow

Thanks
Russ

Now there's a fundamentalist statement: "the opposite may be true." The market sometimes recognizes talent, sometimes not. It is an imperfect arbiter of taste. What it does do, though, is allow for a wide variety of options. The government does not give you options. It is a monopoly. You get what they give you, or nothing. Don't like government-brand corn? Too bad. Don't like the government-brand car? Too bad. Don't like government-brand art? AH, but there's the rub, isn't it? Nobody here wants to believe there will be government-brand art. Except that the government simply cannot support everyone who says they are an artist. There must be someone deciding who gets supported. Who is that going to be? You? I don't think so. Me? Don't think so. This year it may be someone with whom you agree; next year it may be someone with whom you never agree. Or should there be a democratic vote? Do you really want art by democratic vote? How many here write anything a
 democratic majority would want to read? Perhaps a committee? Similar problems arise, just on a smaller scale. In fact, it has the problems of both situations. How, then, is funding to be determined? How much funding? To whom will funding go? The safe bet would be to give it to those who are already successful -- but then, if they are already successful, why do they need government funding? And if they are not successful, how does the government determine who to give funding to, who to support? Based on production? Well, then, what prevents us from having cheaters, who will produce just enough really bad art to get the funding just so they don't have to go get a "real" job? I think about all these things and look at the history of government support for the arts and cannot come to any other conclusion that government funding for the arts is bad for the arts.

One
can always point to people who in your opinion (and, with this list,
mine) are at best embarrassing. However, one can also point to the fact
that Picasso, Monet, and Jasper Johns were all made wealthy during
their lifetimes. I may not like Britney Spears, but I'm also not going
to deprive anyone of her, either, if that's what they like. If you want
to try to educate people to have better taste, that's fine and good --
but there's no evidence the government is good at educating people in
math and reading, let alone good taste. I love how you people have to
purposefully ignore facts to make your points. Throw up a few straw men
(and women, in this case) to try to make a "point."

Troy Camplin

I prefer the phrase "People of Straw" but I don't use the market as any
guide to quality in the arts. In fact, the opposite may be true, but
when you're a fundamentalist, you say funny things, eh?

How to Spell the Sound of Everything
interwriting by Sheila Murphy & mIEKAL aND
2009, 8.25 " x 8.25 ", 84 pgs
$10.00 + postage
ISBN 1-440461-56-2
ISBN-13 978-1-440461-56-9

http://xexoxial.org/is/HowToSpellTheSoundOfEverything/by/sheila_murphy_and_=
mIEKAL_aND

how to spell the sound of everything began in a burst during the fall
of 2007, with mIEKAL's tagging Sheila for a patch of interwriting. the
mist of exchange fractured excitement, spelled sequences of phrasic
musicality. what happened then is happening now, only with ex post
fact'o(f) savor. 10,000 things in the middle of a desert, who needs an
oasis? there are the wavy corpulae moments lean with vigor and
enormous too that you see on cover front and kindred webbed
multifluent hues on the (re)verse. signatories aligned to tidal
movement, to earthly shivering letterforms. placist plenary syllabics
find themselves arhyme. timetables by way of spillage are turned and
amplified when four ears take the tincture of a quarter of a year and
make a cryptacular thing come out in script. friction becomes
fricative in the middle of night looking for water or Finnegan's Wake
in the dark. synaptic-sparks that bless and wrest away the pesky
uninformed slats of daylight minoring in wist. the gymnast of
seductive meaning is in the backyard, away from understanding's
domineering table twisters. The gyst of dharma shakes out feathery
flings into a posse of shine. drinking plenty of Sheila mambo
poetry=97forms striving to learn heads and trees and pores and gemsome
whees to be devouring with devotion.

interwriting thru time, thru delays & interruptions anticipated &
otherwise (some gleaned some left mid-nacht)=97when working together to
gather one finds seizures of thought imposing its signature song field
and attracting a once-over (ingregorian) to be sprawled across
(mid-being). if the remembrance of edits precedes the reading, easily
the moment of the words turning on themselves no known obstacle
competes with this. fluidity is brave or sheer or sweet with opacity
free of city, past the land, a blissful state of making takes the body
of a heart out of its ruts and forms root systems. causality, while
literal, is an allopathic rendering of the agitated taxonomy of two.
mIEKAL waiting for his words to intune vowel patterns & long line
curios. pre-thought is best thought. lo and beyond such into like
cures likeness lacking in duplicatives the fricatelling references
even while it lingers here and here and . . .

you're making a categorical error in this argument. you assume a
government monopoly in a circumstance where there is no reason to
expect one. certainly there is no government monopoly on aerospace
research despite the fact that NASA is a government agency
specifically created to do that. There isn't even a monopoly on some
traditional government monopolies anymore, now that we've outsourced
military logistical support to private industry and begun funding
religious community service organizations with federal tax dollars.

WHile i'm not a huge fan of the secretary of the arts idea, i would
like to see the NEA get more money and more money available for NEA
grants. Certainly in literature as well as in various visual arts
fields and a few of the performing arts, the market doesn't do a very
good job of supporting them. Many function on the good will of
patrons, as artists in the western world always have. I don't see any
reason why the government can't be just another patron.

I guess context doesn't matter. Without context, we can just attribute any meaning at all we want to whatever we read or experience. Decontextualizing cuts off all possible debate or even thinking.

An example: the Bible says "There is no God." Thus, the Bible is an atheistic book and declares God's nonexistence. Nonsense. The full quote is "The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." In context, it means the complete opposite of the previous claim.

Context is king. Without it, rational discussion is impossible, since anything can be asserted.

I'm not saying it was a good sentence -- a good sentence would have read, "As someone whose family were artists in WWII Europe, you . . . , I would think." -- but the referent is in fact clear in context of the discussion. It also helps when you don't conveniently cut off the rest of the sentence, thus eliminating context further.

Troy,=0A=0ALike most of your arguments, you base your stand on a false dich=
otomy. You say if it is not FREE MARKET, it is GOVERNMENT. I was only respo=

try (hey, we can actually get it back to what the LIST is about) poetry is =
part of the gift economy.=0A=0Afrom Wikipedia:=0A=0A=0AA gift economy is a =
social theory[1] in which goods and services are given without any explicit=
 agreement for immediate or future quid pro quo.=0AIdeally simultaneous or =
recurring giving serves to circulate and=0Aredistribute valuables within a =
community. This can be considered a=0Aform of reciprocal altruism.=0AThe co=
ncept of a gift economy stands in contrast to a planned economy or a market=
 or barter economy.=0AIn a planned economy, goods and services are distribu=
ted by explicit=0Acommand and control rather than informal custom; in barte=
r or market=0Aeconomies, an explicit quid pro quo =E2=80=94 an exchange of =
money or some other commodity =E2=80=94 is established before the transacti=
on takes place.=0A=0AOther cultures (& ours, to some degree, in years past)=
 had a different idea of the poet's role in society. Paz and Neruda as Amba=

Hi=2C=20

I'm not entirely sure what the "abject mode" means. But I can suggest some =
writers where the abject features in their work. Maily Canadians because th=
at's what I have in front of me.

Rita Wong. Forage weaves in and out of the abject=2C weaves the abject to t=
he object. Darn good poetry too.=20

In terms of the abject via the body/women/etc.: Nicole Brossard's older stu=
ff=2C particularly in These Our Mothers. Stuff in Daphne Marlatt/Bestsy War=
land's collaborative work (they also have stuff in there that isn't directl=
y about the woman's body=2C but brings the abject to the forefront).=20

That's all that comes to mind right now.

I live in a country where there is government subsidy for the arts. It
is by no means a bad thing. It is vastly prefereble for, say, poetry
publishers to be subsidised to publish poetry books than the system
you have in the US, where publishers run competitions charging
appellants to enter so they can continue to  publish books, which
creates a competition culture that is, to my mind, more corrupting by
far. Your deep study of history, Troy, will have shown you that while
some art can be self-supporting, much of it, and much of the stuff we
now consider most valuable, was only sustained by some form of
patronage. Money has to come from somewhere; whether it's a wealthy
patron or a government sponsored organisation, and someone has to
decide where it ought to go, and sometimes it will be wasted and
sometimes it will not. And any scheme is going to be imperfect. There
wil be patrons with exercrable taste who only want to be flattered,
corporations with no taste at all which only want to be flattered, and
governments who only want to tick a bunch of bureaucratic boxes. But
in a democracy, I'd rather choose the latter among the evils on offer,
because there is actually in practice more chance of a disinterested
outcome. In Australia, it is arms length funding with a process of
peer review. It's about as transparent as it gets. Imperfect, as I
said, but as a system it produces a lot of very high quality art that
otherwise would be unsustainable.

A handy little guide to small talk in the Stone Age
Mark Henderson, Science Editor

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5805522.ece

A "time traveller's phrasebook" that could allow basic communication
between modern English speakers and Stone Age cavemen is being
compiled by scientists studying the evolution of language.

Research has identified a handful of modern words that have changed so
little in tens of thousands of years that ancient hunter-gatherers
would probably have been able to understand them.

Anybody who was catapulted back in time to Ice Age Europe would stand
a good chance of being intelligible to the locals by using words such
as "I", "who" and "thou" and the numbers "two", "three" and "five",
the work suggests.

More nuanced conversation would be more of a challenge. The analysis
of language evolution suggests that none of the adjectives, verbs and
nouns used in modern languages would have much in common with those
used then.

Mark Pagel, of the University of Reading, who leads the research, said
that it was nonetheless becoming possible to create a rudimentary
Stone Age phrasebook made up of the oldest known words.

"If a time traveller wanted to go back in time to a specific date, we
could probably draw up a little phrasebook of the modern words that
are likely to have sounded similar back then," he told The Times. "You
wouldn't be able to discuss anything very complicated, but it might be
enough to get you out of a tight spot."

Dr Pagel's research also predicts which parts of modern vocabulary are
likely to survive into English as it will be spoken 1,000 years in the
future, and which will die out.

By the year 3000, words such as "throw", "stick", "dirty", "guts" and
"squeeze" could easily be gone. These already differ greatly between
related languages, such as English and German, and are good candidates
to evolve into new forms.

Dr Pagel has tracked how words have changed by comparing languages
from the Indo-European family, which includes most of the past and
present languages of Europe, the Middle East and the Indian
sub-continent. All are derived from the same root and have many
linguistic similarities.

The word "water", for example, is wasser in German, eau in French and
aqua in Italian and Latin. Although each is slightly different, they
share a similar sound that shows them to share a common linguistic
ancestor.

By comparing these languages, it is possible to work out how and when
they diverged, and to trace the evolutionary history of individual
words.

Dr Pagel has recently been able to track the evolutionary history of
Indo-European back almost 30,000 years, using a new IBM supercomputer.
He said that some of the oldest words were well over 10,000 years old.

As the original Indo-European language is thought to date back no more
than 9,000 years, Dr Pagel believes that some of the longest-lived
words have an even more venerable history. "I can say with confidence
that there are sounds or words that predate Indo-European," he said.
"If you look at 'thou', 'I' and 'who', we can now tell they are
probably at least 15,000 to 20,000 years old. The sounds used then for
these meanings were probably very similar to those used today."

Dr Pagel's work has shown that the pace at which words evolved depends
on how they are used. Numerals are the slowest to change, followed by
pronouns, probably because they are used extremely often and have a
very precise and important meaning.

These words are highly resistant to evolution, in the same way as
important genes look similar across many different species because
mutations cause a damaging loss of functionality. "Just as we have
highly conserved genes, we have highly conserved words," Dr Pagel
said. "Language shows a truly remarkable fidelity."

Nouns evolve more slowly than verbs, and verbs evolve more slowly than
adjectives. Words that are used less frequently evolve more quickly
than those that are common.

The website http://www.evolution. reading.ac.uk/WordChanges/ shows
whether particular modern English words are likely to be similar or
different for any date in the past or future.

A continuing evolution

The oldest words, resistant to evolution

I, Who, We, Thou, Two, Three and Five

Words that are evolving rapidly, and likely to disappear

Dirty, squeeze, bad, because, guts, push (verb), smell (verb), stab,
stick (noun), turn (verb), wipe

Within the next week or so The Argotist Online will no longer be online, as my web hosting provider is no longer hosting websites. I am in the process of looking for a new host and hopefully the site will be back online before the end of March.

Poetry Project Friday Night Series, Ellie will present "The Catalogue of th=
e
Lost (and other revelations)" a work done in the lecture format, created
during a residency at the Explorers Club (NYC). Comprised of 282 images and
lasting approximately 28 minutes, this work focuses on the missing pieces o=
f
early exploration=ADlost places, people, and concepts as well as the successe=
s
and failures to document =B3the unknown." During 2007-2008, Ellie Ga was the
artist-in-residence on the Tara, a polar schooner locked in the pack-ice of
the Arctic Ocean. Her work from these projects were exhibited recently at
the Konstmuseum in Malmo, Galerie du Jour in Paris, and Projekt 0047 in Osl=

Troy,

Your words again, if rearranged, call for order. Order is what you ask for,
not context.

See for yourself:

Nonsense. There since anything can be asserted, I guess context doesn't
matter. Decontextualizing says possible debate or even thinking Without
context "is no God." we all want to whatever we read or experience meaning.

Thus, the Bible cuts off an atheistic book and The full quote is "The fool
says in his heart, at God attribute any complete opposite of the previous
claim.." In context, we can just the means rational discussion

An example declares God's nonexistence: Context is king. Without it, it is,
the impossible is all Bible.

I don't know about the context argument here. It seems that you've been
presented with a very concrete outline (via Jason's email) about what and
how the govt. should act in regards to art. To answer all this with "context
is king" seems almost to point out the basely obvious.

If you're thinking of Kristeva's definition of the abject, where
meaning breaks down because of the loss of the distinction between
subject and object or self and other, often occurring in response to
a corpse, or shit, sewage, something spoiled, possibly death as a
presence, etc. -- then wouldn't a lot of poetry come in, say Mei-mei
Berssenbrugge's Endocrinology (and certainly, among visual artists,
Kiki Smith works at times in the realm of the abject -- Smith is
Berssenbrugge's collaborator in Endocrinology)? Or what about a poem
like Charles Olson's "On Cole's Island" in Maximus, where Olson
encounters "Death" and his own subjectivity comes into question? And
does a work like bpNichol's Selected Organs bring a wry humorous
twist to the abject, where autobiography is told from the perspective
of one human's organs?

Real Time Ethics investigation #1 / Emily Abendroth & Miranda Mellis

a Nonsite Collective Event

Wednesday, March 4th, 7pm
@ Get Lost Books, 1825 Market Street, San Francisco
with a follow-up discussion-experiment March 6th ( location tba )

Emily: My talk will be rooted in the findings of an ongoing research project
that looks into the history of solitary confinement practices in penal
institutions throughout the United States, but most particularly as they/are
were utilized at Pennsylvania's Eastern State Penitentiary in the early
1800's and at Guantanamo Bay today. In addition to exploring the material
and human conditions of these sites, my process of inquiry aims to
conceptually investigate the vocabularies, taxonomies, and social and state
understandings that made the ongoing legitimation of these environment's
existences possible, and how it might futurally be disrupted.

Miranda: My reading will draw from the text MATERIALISMS, which records and
amplifies language derived from two disparate American archives (open
cases.) First, from the medical records of a community of iron miners and
loggers in Northern Michigan. The medical case files explicitly and
implicitly evidence the traumas and abuses of capitalist exploitation. The
high diction of the rural doctor who wrote the files between 1900 and 1934,
my great-grandfather, describes at once obsolete anesthetics and obsolete
aesthetics: literary professionalism. The second vein also pulls from an
atavistic 'felt' archive: childhood in a Marxist-Leninist collective in the
Haight-Ashbury during the 1970s and 80s. These two materialisms--the
production of iron ore and lumber on one end of the century and the
production of anti-capitalist ideology on the other--constitute a framework
in which to sound out the contradictions in instrumentalist production and
idiom. Here is a link to excerpts from Materialisms in Harp & Altar:

http://www.harpandaltar.com/interior.php?t=s&i=3&p=25&e=47

Emily Abendroth is a writer and artist, alternately residing in the San
Francisco Bay area and Philadelphia, where she co-curates the Moles not
Molar Reading Series with poet Justin Audia. Her book-length work in
progress Muzzle Blast Dander can be found in Refuge/Refugee (Volume 3 of the
Chain Link book series). Recent work of hers can be found or is forthcoming
in Digital Artifact, Encyclopedia, How2, Pocket Myths, Horseless Review,
Eco-poetics, and Cut and Paint. Her chapbook, Toward Eadward Forward was
published by Horse less Press this past november. She is currently and
ever-so-slowly piecing her way through some writings and thinking on
solitary confinement practices in U.S. prisons.

Miranda Mellis is the author of The Revisionist (Calamari Press),
Materialisms (Portable press at Yo Yo labs), and Transformer (forthcoming).
She is an editor at The Encyclopedia Project and teaches at California
College of the Arts. Her various writings may be found in various
publications, most currently Modern Painters, Denver Quarterly, and The
Believer.

REAL TIME ETHICS is a series of actions and readings and conversations and
scores and moment to moment compositions that investigate the time in which
we make meaningful sounds at and with each other. Do particular instances of
our speech have particular durational frames. How are those instances
embodied or disembodied or semi-embodied? What happens when we experiment
with these frames? when we don't experiment? when we cease to experiment? In
real time? Do our ethics extend beyond the fabula of the 'content' of our
speech? Each investigation will consist of a reading/talk/presentation
followed-up by a separately scheduled 'activity' that aims to bring a
dynamic of the work into the 'real time' of present relation and discourse.

Troy,

As I read your responses to George Bowering, I am somewhat struck by thei=
r
ignorance. First of all, George Bowering probably receives or has receive=
d
grants from the Canada Council of the Arts or his province's art
administration. Secondly, the Canadian government has provides much more
funding for its artists than the free(er) market United States and has
allowed its literature to be much more vibrant and interesting than the v=
ast
majority of American poetry (some examples of fine Canadian poets: Erin
Mour=E9, Nicole Broussard, Aaron Peck, angela rawlings, Jordan Scott, ...=
).
The same can be said of many Western European countries where the governm=
ent
provides subsidies for its writers and artists.

Best,

fran=E7ois luong

PS: I am not Canadian or a resident of Canada.

As for contemporary poets, Lara Glenum's Hounds of No and Maximum Ga Ga, bo=
th from Action Books, come readily to mind as a perfect fit. Maybe also Ari=
ana Reynes's The Cow. D. A. Powell addresses this at times re: HIV/AIDS and=
 homophobia, as did the performance artist Diamanda Galas in the 80s. If yo=
u're heading back to Baudelaire, another suggestion along those lines would=
 be Nerval. I think Kristeva, in fact wrote about him in The Powers of Horr=
or (although, on second thought, that may be Black Sun). Maybe check out Ja=
ime Saens's The Night?=20

If you could share your list when you're done, that'd be great!=20

Strange! Very strange! I'm hearing more and more that Canada is reputed =
to
be a hotbed of poetic innovation and yet, from inside Canada, what is =
more
apparent is Canada's  hidebound traditionalism. There seems to be only =
two
regions of Canada where the radical reigns supreme - Montreal and =
Vancouver.
Fortunately for Bowering, he came of age in a place and of a time when =
this
radicalism was supreme - and only because of the presence of U.S. poets =
(the
Black Mountain Projectionists). A similar thing is happening in =
Vancouver
today as a result of the presence of the Kootenay School of Writing =
which
can be attributed to Language Writing. Montreal profited from its
connections to France and the Tel Quel group, Quebec, Canada's French
province, being the first to have access to postmodernist literature. If =
not
for the presence  of bpNichol, Steve McCaffrey, Stevie Ross Smith and =
other
sound and concrete poets who were definitely in the minority, English =
Canada
would continue to suffer from ossification - something it continues to
suffer from today. An interesting Canadian writer which you mention,
Francois, is Erin Moure who was born and raised in the most conservative =
of
Canadian provinces, Alberta, (Canada's Texas) but who left in her early
twenties for Vancouver and then left there for Montreal benefiting from =
the
radicalism of both. But Canada as more interesting poetically than the =
U.S.,
hardly!  Perhaps on an equal footing as a result of U.S. influence, but =
not
more than.

Troy,

As I read your responses to George Bowering, I am somewhat struck by =
their
ignorance. First of all, George Bowering probably receives or has =
received
grants from the Canada Council of the Arts or his province's art
administration. Secondly, the Canadian government has provides much more
funding for its artists than the free(er) market United States and has
allowed its literature to be much more vibrant and interesting than the =
vast
majority of American poetry (some examples of fine Canadian poets: Erin
Mour=E9, Nicole Broussard, Aaron Peck, angela rawlings, Jordan Scott, =
...).
The same can be said of many Western European countries where the =
government
provides subsidies for its writers and artists.

Canada has a similar system. However, rather than just relying on =
government
largesse to determine what is and isn't art, most literary publications =
also
run poetry, short story, etc. contests to subsidize this rather than
condemning themselves to being wholly dependent upon the tyranny of =
those
fat asses in Ottawa.

I live in a country where there is government subsidy for the arts. It
is by no means a bad thing. It is vastly prefereble for, say, poetry
publishers to be subsidised to publish poetry books than the system
you have in the US, where publishers run competitions charging
appellants to enter so they can continue to  publish books, which
creates a competition culture that is, to my mind, more corrupting by
far. Your deep study of history, Troy, will have shown you that while
some art can be self-supporting, much of it, and much of the stuff we
now consider most valuable, was only sustained by some form of
patronage. Money has to come from somewhere; whether it's a wealthy
patron or a government sponsored organisation, and someone has to
decide where it ought to go, and sometimes it will be wasted and
sometimes it will not. And any scheme is going to be imperfect. There
wil be patrons with exercrable taste who only want to be flattered,
corporations with no taste at all which only want to be flattered, and
governments who only want to tick a bunch of bureaucratic boxes. But
in a democracy, I'd rather choose the latter among the evils on offer,
because there is actually in practice more chance of a disinterested
outcome. In Australia, it is arms length funding with a process of
peer review. It's about as transparent as it gets. Imperfect, as I
said, but as a system it produces a lot of very high quality art that
otherwise would be unsustainable.

The problem with Paul Nelson's objection to Troy's notion that a free mark=
et is a good
judge of artistic merit is that it means Paul has put himself in an untena=
ble position:
he's implicitly arguing that some poems are better than others, and that s=
ome people
can tell which ones those poems are -- it's an elitist position, one that =
will get him in a
lot of trouble if he's not careful, and get him lumped in with Troy as an =
equality-hater.
Be careful, Paul! You just can't say that some poems are better than other=
s, or some
poets better than others, without getting accused of elitism!

You're not an elitist, are you, Paul?

The underlying issue here, though, is not how, of the many ways there are, to
encourage excellence, but whether there is anything in the field of literature, or even of
art in general, that can be reliably agreed to as excellence.

Can you imagine describing an engineer's work, or a doctor's, or any of innumerable
other professions' work, as "Nuyorican" or as "representative of the Black experience"
or as "diasporic" or "emblematic of the queer community" or "lesbian" or in terms of
any other non-volitional category? Isn't it, in fact, simply not done in the best circles any
more to say such things as "you throw well for a girl" or "you fly a plane well for a black
guy" or "you shoot well for a queer"? Why is it, then, that you approve of saying and
reading "you write good poems for a lesbian, foreigner, Muslim, whatever"?

Hi Alison,

>said

and at the end of the arm there is the hand that you should probably
have shaken a few times in order to land a writing grant

so often, it comes down to who you know  - let me lie in the arms of a
peer who likes my poems

yep, imperfect, as you said

Australia - a tiny pond teeming with grant applicants

First, it is not the case that any argument or statement, or, in fact, anything, that
operates independently of government is "hence ideological". Whether a belief system
is enforced by a government or not is not what makes an argument or statement
ideological. Government, in fact, has nothing whatever to do with whether a thing is
ideological. Governments come after ideology, not before, if they come at all.

Second, the market also comes before governments, not before. Governments are
invented to enforce ideologies and markets, not the other way around. There is no
need for government where there is no clash of ideologies or needs. The point of
government is to try to regulate those human interactions that create conflict.

well, i generally don't care for such work. if it has to rely on
expressing an experience of a community rather than an individual to
earn praise then probably it's fairly weak.

that having been said, saying something comes out of a community and
expresses something about that community is not a qualifier it's
generally much more descriptive and not at all evaluative in the way
that "you throw well for a girl" is. The latter expresses the opinion
that girls don't generally throw well, but saying that something is
representative of the Black experience in America, as one might
rightly say of Hughes's "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" or Baraka's
"Black People," doesn't contain that same qualitative load. Indeed in
the case of the poets cited, I think it's fairly clear that what's
being described is precisely the content of the poem, not the poems
relative worth. Go to enough poetry slams and you'll see plenty of
sexuality/race/political poetry that while it may be any of the
phrases you cite, and rightly called so, but also happens to blow
donkeys.

Alrighty. I didn't mean to get in to this whole chicken and the egg thing,
and when I reread what I wrote I see obvious flaws (I'm no economist, I'm
sure you'll be shocked to learn). So for the sake of everybody I'll just let
this drop.

It's good to see someone south of the boarder standing up for government fu=
nding in Canadian arts. Thanks Francois. To add to that=2C it is the govern=
ment funding allows all the talented writers (particularly the ones mention=
ed below) to create their work and distribute it=2C because although their =
work is brilliant=2C it's not easily digestible (in terms of what the marke=
t requires for consumption)=2C and therefore opposed to the principles that=
 govern "the market".

However=2C a major problem that I noticed from the start of this debate is =
that it is taking for granted (in life=2C in this conversation) that "the m=
arket" indeed has skills of discernment. The market cannot recognize anythi=
ng. It's not a person=2C nor does it have eyes=2C or thoughts=2C or feeling=
s. Though "the market" may require humans to exist or to perpetuate itself=
=2C human "taste" (as relative and arbitrary as that may be) plays a minusc=
ule role in determining what is produced by the market. In order for the ma=
rket to operate as it does=2C it requires "efficiency" (translate: cheap pr=
oducts=2C made quickly=2C sold for a lot of money). Human desire comes into=
 play at one point or another=2C but psychoanalysts and cultural theorists =
across the board have demonstrated time and again that desire is just as ea=
sily appeased with simulation and simulacra as it is with the "authentic" t=
hing.=20

Therefore=2C the market generates "schlock and kitsch" (as the big ol' F.J.=
 puts it) in order to sustain itself. The subject who is fully immersed in =
the market--that is the ideal market-subject who can supposedly discern--is=
 equally satisfied with kitsch as it is with anything else.=20

Perhaps you're not. And I think=2C neither are most people on this listserv=
. Which is the point I'm making.

So three cheers for government funding for the arts!=20

Subject:      Call for submissions and recordings -- Linebreak
Mime-Version: 1.0

Linebreak, an online magazine of original poetry, recently celebrated its=
 first anniversary.=20
As we enter our second year of publication, we'd like to renew our standi=
ng call for=20
submissions.

Our format is a little different than most online journals and magazines.=
 Each Tuesday we=20
publish a single poem, which is then featured on the site for the entire =
week. The text of=20
each poem is accompanied by an audio recording, but the recording isn't m=
ade by the=20
author of the poem. Instead, we choose a different working poet to read a=
nd record the=20
poem. Our hope is that the selection of a different voice offers everyone=
 =97 including the=20
poem's author =97 the chance to hear the poem in a new way.

Submissions of original, previously unpublished poems are read throughout=
 the year.=20
Simultaneous submissions are welcome. To submit, please send no more than=
 five poems=20
in the body of an email to submissions@linebreak.org.

In addition to poems, we're also looking for poets who are willing to rec=
ord for us. If=20
you're interested, please send a brief bio and list of publications to ed=
itors@linebreak.org.=20
Please also describe your recording equipment, if you have any. (If not, =
we have a=20
portable recorder that we can send through the mail.)

As with any publication, the best way to select work for submission is to=
 read our=20
archives. The address to remember is:

http://linebreak.org

Thanks,
