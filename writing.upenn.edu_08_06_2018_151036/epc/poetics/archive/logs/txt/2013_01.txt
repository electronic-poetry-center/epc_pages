Cathexis/Catharsis: Writing To/Through Illness and Suffering
Poetry workshop taught by Sharon Mesmer
10 weeks beginning Tuesday, February 5
7 > 9pm=20
$250
The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 E. 10th Street, New York
212-674-0910 | info@poetryproject.org

Illness and suffering are usually imaged as sites of trauma, feared as =
obstacles, rejected by a youth-obsessed culture.  But what if these =
forsaken places could be re-imaged and understood, with the help of =
poetry, as talismans, thresholds, gateways?  What if suffering were a =
language like any other that could be learned, manipulated and deployed =
in a powerful new way?  In this form-based workshop we will look at how =
poets encode and stabilize ideas about illness and suffering (their own =
and that of others) into traditional and novel poetic architectures, =
enabling readers and writers to find new meanings in these witnessed =
experiences.  We'll begin by looking at Jennifer Nix's essay, "Finding =
Poetry In Illness," then move on to poems by Anne Sexton, Aracelis =
Girmay, Joanne Kyger, Robert Lowell, Laynie Browne, Bob Kaufman, Allen =
Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, Wordsworth, Jane Kenyon, Rainer Maria Rilke and =
Thomas Hardy.  Each week we'll examine and discuss a poem that utilizes =
a form (the sonnet, the ode, the list poem, the "instruction" poem, the =
Fibonacci, etc.) and flow and encode our own experiences into the =
stabilizing mechanism of that form.  Guest speakers will include Kristin =
Prevallet on the mind-body connection to poetry and healing, and Laynie =
Brown on the poem-as-amulet.

Sharon Mesmer is the author of the poetry collections Annoying Diabetic =
Bitch (Combo Books 2008), The Virgin Formica (Hanging Loose 2008) and =
Half Angel, Half Lunch (Hard Press 1998), as well as several fiction =

Dear Printed Matter lover (yeah, I'm talking to you),

When we started Boog, Rod and I had a simple motto: Get the Word Out. =20=

Now, over 21 years later, that motto still holds true.

I love these issues getting into the hands of the folks who've already =20=

heard of The Portable Boog Reader and know the names of the poets and =20=

want to read more of their work and want to add the issue to their =20
printed matter collections.

But I equally love someone who's never heard of The Portable Boog =20
Reader, knows the name of none of the poets in it, and only owns a =20
Norton Anthology grabbing a copy while in lower Manhattan waiting for =20=

their date before a Saturday movie night at the Angelika, picking one =20=

up while at Other Music filling a hole in their Elliott Smith =20
collection, clothes shopping at Trash and Vaudeville, eating dinner at =20=

Greenpoint's Thai Caf=E9, or looking at art in Williamsburg's Sideshow =20=

Gallery.

And I need your help getting the PBR, as we lovingly call it, into as =20=

many hands as possible.

Yes, the Portable Boog Reader 6: An Anthology of New York City and =20
Philadelphia Poetry will be online Midnight Saturday into Sunday at =
http://www.boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc77.pdf=20
  (You can view the cover and list of contributors there now.).

But that won't get it out to as wide an audience as it deserves.

I know you are someone who feels that printed matter matters.

We need your help in getting the word out, to our usual audience and a =20=

whole new one, too, bringing poetry to that wider audience, in a =20
publication with a greater circulation than almost all poets will ever =20=

experience.

The issue is ready to go to the printer. We need to raise $360 to get =20=

it there.

Whatever amount you give, give us that many words to put in our "Thank =20=

you to our Donors" section in the issue, and the text could be most =20
anything.

$36=3D36 words
$18=3D18 words
and so on.

If we can get just 20 people to give $18 each issue, we'll have the =20
issue on the streets.

You can support the PBR through editor@boogcity.com via paypal.com

Thanks for your continued support.

as ever,
David

"How can we design walking in the city as an education experiment so that
we understand that the way we walk down the street reinforces or
renegotiates the political and economic speeds investments feelings and
systems in public space?"

With sadness I mark the passing of Harvey Shapiro. The world will not be
the same for me in some profound way now.



He's remembered, in my view, beautifully in the Times obit (
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/books/harvey-shapiro-poet-of-new-york-and=
-beyond-dies-at-88.html)
by Margalit Fox, who mentions Hart Crane along with Charles Reznikoff  as
important influences; but I would wish to stress the latter--Harvey was the
master of plain statement (imho).



In case you've not seen the obit I am reproducing one of the poems she
included (she made terrific selections, I think)--I regret I did not see
this poem before now (it was published in Bomb in 2011), especially because
I think it truly is a great poem, one that ascends to greatness with grace,
elegance, and a sense of ease.



Here it is:







The Mother of Invention





*On my desk are the bills from the living**
**and in my sleep are the bills from the dead.***

*=93Emptiness is the mother of invention=94**
**says my fortune cookie. July 23, 2010.**
**Brooklyn**. I walk in the slow rain,**
**never less accomplished, never happier.***

*Why should I doubt the world has meaning**
**when even in myself I see mysterious purposes.***

*A crow drops down for a moment,**
**black, rabbinical garb, croaking Kaddish.***





Here's another one of Harvey's poems that Fox might have included in the
obit (to mark his WWII service--btw, see his role in the genesis of MLK's
"Letter from Birmingham Jail"):







Italy, 1996



This Italian earth is special to me

because I was here in a war

when I was young and immortal.

I remember the cypresses in the early morning light

on the road to the airfield

before the sky filled with toiling planes

massing high over Italy for the perilous

crossing to Germany. I remember

on the way back from the target toasting

my frozen cheese sandwich=97frozen by the high altitude=97

on the electrically-heated casing of my fifty-caliber

machine gun. I remember the taste of life.





B.K.

Creative Writing Workshop, with poet, Shakespearean, musician, =20
essayist Chris Stroffolino in a fun, nurturing, non-institutional or =20
graded setting*



8 Three Hour Sessions; 1st 2013 session begins Late February. Dates & =20=

times to be determined depending on the needs of the class (I will do =20=

out best to accommodate people=92s schedules--most likely a weeknight).



Class Size: minimum of 5, maximum of 10

Cost $400: Check, money-order, or cash are all acceptable.



Course Description: Do you have something to say, but don=92t quite know =
=20
what is the best way to communicate it? Do you need to write for the =20
sake of self-knowledge or catharsis, but aren=92t sure if you want to =20=

make it public? Did a friend, teacher, or other professional writer =20
call your work a =91mere journal entry?=92 or even a =91song lyric?=92 =
Did =20
they say your poetry rhymed too much, or maybe not enough? Did they =20
say your prose was too poetic? Or had too many ideas & not enough =20
characters? Does writing that they claim is =91better=92 than yours fail =
=20
to speak to you?



If you=92ve answered YES to any of these questions (or even if you think =
=20
they=92re silly), this is the workshop for you. Taking each student=92s =20=

writing and/or performance pieces as the starting point, this workshop =20=

encourages students writing in different genres. Students may work =20
within one genre throughout the entire course, but will be encouraged =20=

to explore a way of stylistic options including screenplays, poems, =20
manifestoes, creative-non-fiction, dialogue pieces, performance texts, =20=

song lyrics, poem-paintings, videos, texts that redefine or de-define =20=

genre, =91hybrid texts,=92 or =91non-poetry.=92 Students will offer =
critiques =20
of each other=92s work to create a dialogue within a =91unity in =20
diversity=92 approach. By the end of the class, students can expect a =20=

deeper understanding into the creative process as well as the business =20=

of publishing or other ways of making their work public. Note: this =20
class is intended for all levels.



Chris Stroffolino is the author of 7 book of poetry, including Light =20
As A Fetter (2007), Speculative Primitive (2004), Scratch Vocals =20
(2003), Stealer=92s Wheel (1999), Cusps (1995), and Oops (1994). He also =
=20
published 2 books of Literary Criticism, Spin Cycle (2001), and, with =20=

David Rosenthal, a critical study of Shakespeare=92s 12th Night (2000). =20=

He received a PhD in Shakespeare studies and has worked with The =20
Actors Shakespeare Company (Albany, NY) and Cal Shakespeare (Orinda). =20=

Subject:      my 'best of' canadian poetry books 2012 list

is now up at the dusie blog (Switzerland):

For many, year-end means a moment of reflection, and the appearance of
lists, lists and more lists. Calling anything a best of is an obvious
misnomer, but there are still books that are so good that they're difficult
to ignore, and impossible to not recommend. Ive received and picked up
numerous poetry books by Canadians and other, and thought it might be
worth compiling a list of the Canadian titles that really stuck out, over
the past calendar year.

I did a similar list last year as well.

Here are sixteen poetry books that came out in 2012 by Canadian writers
that I would consider worthy of further attention, listed in no particular
order:

http://dusie.blogspot.ca/2013/01/a-best-of-list-of-2012-canadian-poetry_9.html

    1. Jenna Butler, Wells
    2. Barbara Langhorst, Restless White Fields
    3. Lise Downe, This Way
    4. Nelson Ball, In This Thin Rain
    5. Erin Moure, The Unmemntioable
    6. Natalie Zina Walshots, Doom: Love Poems for Supervillains
    7. Marcus McCann, The Hard Return
    8. Nicole Markotic, Bent at the Spine
    9. Mark Goldstein, Form of Forms
    10. Glen Downie, Left for Right
    11. Gerry Gilbert, COUNTERFEIT PENNIES
    12. Sarah Pinder, Cutting Room
    13. Camille Martin, Looms

Thanks to Steve Spence=92s review of Looms for Stride Magazine. An excerpt:

=93[Looms] has a very painterly, noir feel, alienated and penumbral, taut y=
et
expansive. Impressive and addictive.=94

And thanks also to rob mclennan for including Looms on his annual Dusie
list of best Canadian poetry books. An excerpt from his review::

=93These are poems of exploration, not always conscious or concerned about
where they might end, allowing for a fearlessness that permeates the entire
work.=94

Nice to be in such inspiring company as Jonathan Ball, Lise Downe, Erin
Moure, Nicole Markotic, and Marcus McCann . . .

Rather wonderful 'sound poet' performance, 1955, within a movie. I forget if it was Geof Huth or mIIEKAL or an associate that ferreted this piece back into the world. But great that whoever did it, did!Sweetly amazing!

This piece was first shown to me in Paris around 2007 by Eric Monsinjean, =
a student of lettrist Roland Sabatier. I was crashing at his apartment bef=
ore flying out. This is in the BBC Around the Word with Orson Welles serie=
s, that includes a few other gems. The interview with Isidora Duncan's son=
 is weird as hell, and in the Letterism (sic) piece, Jean Cocteau and Juli=
ette Greco implicate themselves. There is also a shot of Gabriel Pomerand =
reciting, probably at the club Tabou. But the reaction shot is stolen from=
 a Cocteau film, I think. A lot to decipher here. Still, a priceless pictu=

Book Launch:
Lucky Pierre's America/n

on Inauguration Day
Monday, January 21st
6-8pm

at Uncharted Books
2630 N. Milwaukee Ave
Chicago, Illinois
http://www.unchartedbooks.com

This Inauguration day, join art collaborative Lucky Pierre and friends for a reading from their new book, America/n. The book is the culmination of a project to investigate the US Constitution.

Lucky Pierre invited artists, activists and scholars to present a section of the Constitution during a 13 hour performance on November 6th, Election Day: Amber Ginsburg, Tom Ginsburg, John Rich, David Kodeski, Robin Cline, Edward Thomas-Herrera, Laura Stempel, Davey K., Aaron Maier, Brandon Alvendia, Jennifer Karmin, Marc Fischer, Melinda Fries, David Isaacson, Chris Schoen, Jen Blair, Jim Snyder, Andrew Fenchel, Alisa Wolfson, Matthew Nicholas, Paul Durica, Anne Elizabeth Moore, Jeffrey Kowalkowski, Don Washington, Robert Metrick & Barrie Cole.

Says Lucky Pierre, "We have created a book, hoping to capture what we learned, what we loved, and what made us laugh. Equal Parts artists book, literary journal, and pocket Constitution, we believe we captured some of the collective experience of the day."  Barrie Cole, David Isaacson and Jeff Kowalkowski will be reading/performing some of their material from the book.  Snacks and drinks provided.  We'll make a toast to the artists and another to the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.

Yes, the ad is not clear, and I apologize for that: sorting that out as as
possible.  The search is for a fiction writer.

After a little hiatus we are back with a new chapbook from Nicholas
Alexander Hayes, *ThirdSexPot*.

from the Preface:

"Many one-hand reads exist as ephemeral artifacts. Some are stunningly
brilliant.
Some are poorly written. Some are so poorly and hastily written a type of
poetry
emerges from their text. This last mode was particularly true of the
introduction
to Johnny Shearer=92s The Male Hustler."

Subject:      rob's end-of-year list of 2012 Canadian poetry chapbooks;

My "end-of-year list of 2012 Canadian poetry chapbooks" list is now online
at Branta.ca

http://www.gooselane.com/blog/2013/01/an-end-of-year-list-of-2012-canadian-poetry-chapbooks/

For many, year-end means a moment of reflection, and the appearance of
lists, lists and more lists. Ive received and picked up numerous poetry
chapbooks, and thought it might be worth compiling a list of the Canadian
titles that really stuck out, over the past calendar year.

The only really frustrating thing about a list such as this is knowing how
woefully incomplete it is, including all the chapbooks that, for whatever
reason, I couldnt get my hands on. Consider this a mere fraction of
Canadian poetry activity in the realm of small and micro publishing.

Here they are, in no particular order:

1. Marcus McCann, Labradoodle
2. ryan fitzpatrick, 21st Century Monsters
3. Fred Wah, Medallions of Belief
4. Monty Reid, Garden (dec unit)
5. Margaret Christakos, from Tumulttudes: The Chips & Ties Study
6. Jon Paul Fiorentino, The Winnipeg Cold Storage Company
7. Gil McElroy, Ordinary Time: The Merton Lake Propers
8. Douglas Barbour, Recording Dates
9. Marilyn Irwin, little nothings
10. Rachael Simpson, Eiderdown
11. Phil Hall, A Rural Pen
12. Liz Howard, (skullambient)
13. Shannon Maguire, Fruit Machine
14. David Peter Clark, feathereDinosaurs

See the link for write-ups on each of the titles.

    Dear editor,
you are requested to post fallowing Call for submission on your website:

Dr Jha
"Dear Poet,   It is rare occasion when publisher shows interest in
publishing poetry.
Richard M. Grove, the poet and publisher of Hidden Brook Press, Canada has
reposed great faith in Indian English Poetry and shown curiosity in
publishing an anthology on Indian English Poetry. For this   reason it is
my earnest request to send your 3-5 published or unpublished poems on email
id jha.vivekanand7@gmail.com and make this anthology successful on
international level. I know without your generous and creative support the
anthology will remain incomplete and representation of Indian English
poetry in the international arena will not be justified. For your reference
the link for submission call is  <
http://www.hiddenbrookpress.com/Book-Indo-EnglishPoetry.html>


I want to clear doubt regarding my earlier call for submission and assure
you that it is not essential and compulsion to purchase the copy of
anthology and at the same time publisher will not be able to give you a
free copy as a contributor if your poem/poems are selected for publication
in this anthology of poems. Your any queries and grievances are most
welcome. Please ignore the message displayed on the website of the
publisher regarding purchasing the copy of the anthology.

 Dr Vivekanand Jha"

Subject:      One Source of Linguistically Innovative Poetry (and Visual
              Poetry) in Temperance Literature of the 19th c.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In going through the old American newspapers of the middle to late 19th
century, I've noticed an interesting trend.  Much poetry of the
Temperance Movement seems to be of what we may call the linguistically
innovative variety.  Perhaps because the "rules" of polite discourse
were bent neigh to bursting by the inroads of demon rum (at least in the
perceptions of those who agitated for the acceptance of "Cold Water"
over alcohol), that poetic form as well as syntax, spelling, and etc.
were loosened up in quite an interesting manner.  There was also a
freedom displayed in the composing and publishing of what we might now
call Visual Poetry--primarily of hour glasses and bottles made up of
words--playfully put together, but with the deadly serious intent of
creating a nation of teetotalers.  Below is an example of a temperance
poem that could have been written by Bill Bisset on an overcast day.

Thanks, Jesse! It wasn't just the temperance writers who went in for
creative spelling in the 1850s, though. Phonetic orthography was
standard procedure for humorists like Josh Billings, Artemus Ward,
Petroleum V. Nasby (all of those names are pseudonyms), and the
genuinely disturbing and genuinely creative Sut Lovingood (George
Washington Harris). Here's an introduction to the prose, with a link.

http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/hns/swhumor/fool.htm

And here's Artemus Ward's (Charles Farrar Browne) report on a visit to a
Shaker family.

Of course, we're a fan of Sut's, but this isn't dialect humor we're
talking about. And funny spelling doesn't a linguistically innovative
poem make. There's a real difference between Sut L. and the rest you
mention, and the anonymous author of the poem I posted--can you spot it?

Subject:      Woodland Pattern Archives and the Tragedy of Big and Little Ray
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is exciting news indeed!  I've been a fan of Woodland Pattern since
1980.  I used to call it Church and set up chairs for readings so I
could get in free.  Some of the happiest memories of my stay in
Milwaukee are centered right there with Karl and Anne and the many
others who made that Bookcenter hum.  Woodland Pattern is located on
Locust Street in the boho area of River West.  A Grocery Co-Op was right
up the street, and Big Ray's Tap was right there too.  The Tragedy of
Big and Little Ray and the Tap is of Euripidean proportions and needs to
be told someday in story or song.  While poetry and new music could be
had at Woodland Pattern, free bar food and 25 cent water glasses of
Miller made it handy to buy a round for everybody and be everybody's
pal at Big Ray's.  Then there was gap-toothed Tiny Mo the accordion
player on Polka Nights.  Though there were lots of new and exciting
forms of language going on at Woodland Pattern, Big Ray's was the only
place I ever heard the word "overneath" used in conversation.  In
short, one could have it all on Locust Street, and to be young there was
very heaven.  Jess

one week of assuming her first full-time teaching post. Her poems have =20=

Poetics List friends,

This past summer in Los Angeles, some excitement between Heiser=92s new wor=
k in town and Higgs boson. So from Deborah Meadows:

      *

Recent matter.



An index or stubby shadow of duration.

Imperfect knowledge was a lot to go on.

A cross-section unveils the upward slope
to a pyramid=92s interior chamber. That kind of thing.

As a philosophic question, it always relates to us.
We make exceptions for scale, enlarge epistemology.

Incidental music to its larger theme.

Is it more limber or various than mathematics,
or solitary in its indivisible function? A Levitated Mass?

A large team was to dying before replacements
are exhausted as particles themselves.

Transposed: the blur simultaneous to Hammurabi=92s edict
for built structure in typical practice.

How the latest descriptors fool around with something inherent.

			*

			[enroll in ModPo for fall '13: =
https://www.coursera.org/course/modernpoetry]

Dear friends and colleagues:

"ModPo" is an entirely free, non-credit, online 10-week version of the =
14-week course on modern and contemporary American poetry I've been =
teaching for thirty years, mostly here at Penn in Philadelphia, mostly =
here in the Kelly Writers House.=20

The course makes use of audio recordings of the poets reading the poems =
we discuss, as well as other materials and resources we've assembled =
through PennSound, Jacket2, PoemTalk and the programs of the Kelly =
Writers House over the years.

The course was offered last fall, with 36,000 people enrolled from 129 =
different countries. An overview of that experience, including links to =
reviews of and articles about the course, is available here:=20

https://jacket2.org/commentary/modpo-overview=20

As of today, we are taking enrollments for the second running of ModPo - =
starting Saturday, September 7, and finishing 10 weeks plus two days =
later, on Monday, November 18. One can enroll here:

https://www.coursera.org/course/modernpoetry

- providing merely an email address and name (no other information is =
requested). As I say, it is entirely free and entirely open. (Entirely =
open: for instance, a number of people with disabilities took the course =
last time, with little to no difficulty; and people in remote places =
with slow and far-flung connections were still able to keep up; =
participants ranged from 15 to 95 years old; etc.)

A 20-minute video introduction to the course can be found on YouTube =
here: http://youtu.be/HsE6f0hbHwI .

If you know of teachers, poets, students and friends who might like to =
give this introduction to modern & contemporary poetry a try, please =
forward this message to them and encourage them to enroll.

Best wishes,

- Al

Please consider joining us for some of these events if you are around the
Mid-West next week!
*

Native Women Language Keepers: Indigenous Performance Practices. An
Arts-Based Research Symposium with playwright Alanis King*
*
January 28th to February 1st 2013, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor*

Aanii! Join us for UM=92s sixth arts-based research symposium, a week-long
exploration of Native women=92s practices as language teachers, activists,
and artists. In this week, we=92re workshopping a play by celebrated Native
playwright Alanis King, and we will work in close connection with
Miiskwaasinii=92ing Nagamojig (The Swamp Singers), a Michigan-based hand-dr=
um
group, to create a praise song for Daphne Odjig=92s woodland paintings in t=
he
University of Michigan=92s archives.
This symposium will marry the strengths of the University of Michigan=92s
Anishinaabemowin language program, a thriving community of language
teachers and learners, with our series of arts-based research symposia, in
which we investigate ways of knowing through creative means.
In this week, we want to ask questions about the place of performance and
women=92s work in language survivance and revitalization, about decolonizin=
g
methodologies and performance, about honoring Native women artists, and
about intercultural performance practices.

Afternoon, 2pm, Duderstadt Center Video Studio, North Campus
*Emilie Monnet *is an interdisciplinary artist with Anishnabe and French
heritage and a graduate of Ondinnok=92s First Nations Theatre training

which she was awarded the LOGIQ prize for the most outstanding Art/Culture
project of 2011. In May 2012, Emilie directed Songs of Mourning, Songs of
Life, a musical theatrical show addressing legacies of genocide and the
role of art for collective mourning, in collaboration with the Aboriginal
women=92s drum group Odaya and the Rwandan traditional musical ensemble,
Komezinganzo.
She has two works in development: OKINUM, a one-women interdisciplinary
performance inspired by her great great grand-mother, and another theatre
collaboration with indigenous artists from the Amazon, Colombia. Emilie=92s
artistic engagement is inspired by years of social activism with indigenous
organizations in Canada and Latin America, and community art projects with
incarcerated women and Aboriginal youth. Emilie is the founder and Artistic
Director of ONISHKA, an arts organization that fosters artistic
collaborations between indigenous peoples worldwide while honoring their
richness, diversity and resilience (www.onishka.org).

Evening, Central Campus North Quad, Room 2435:
7pm, Formal Symposium Opening with *Heid Erdrich*

Poet Heid E. Erdrich, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwe, was
born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, and raised in nearby Wahpeton, North
Dakota, where her Ojibwe mother and German American father taught at the
Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school.
 Erdrich=92s poetry often explores themes of indigenous culture, mothering,
and the natural world, using the cadence of oral storytelling and a close
attention to sound and meter to drive poems rich with sensory and dreamlike
imagery. Erdrich is the author of several poetry collections, including
Cell Traffic (2012), National Monuments (2008), winner of the Minnesota
Book Award; The Mother=92s Tongue (2005), part of Salt Publishing=92s
award-winning Earthworks Series of Native American and Latin American
literature; and Fishing for Myth (1997). In a 2006 review, Twin Cities
Daily Planet critic Erin Lynn Marsh described The Mother=92s Tongue as =93a=
n
exploration of our culture=92s relationship with the term =91mother=92 and =
of the
beginnings of language.=94
With her sister, the writer Louise Erdrich, she founded the Turtle Mountain
Writing Workshop. In 2008 the sisters co-founded Birchbark House, an
organization that promotes literature written in indigenous languages. The
sisters describe their vision on the foundation=92s website: =93We foresee =
a
vital return to our Native American languages through the efforts of elders
that are already underway. In creating ways to keep their words alive,
through books, films, teaching and more, we will keep our languages viable
and more, we will allow the means for creative fluency, the hallmark of a
fully living language.=94

theater projects at a community level.
She will lead a ten-minute play, Friends, which was published in Performing

Studio, North Campus
Virginie Magnat is Assistant Professor of Performance at University of
British Columbia, Okanagan. She conducts embodied research on transmission
processes among women performers from different cultures, traditions, and
generations; and draws from Indigenous epistemologies and methodologies to
examine the interrelation of lived experience, embodied knowledge,
tradition, creativity, and spirituality. Her essay "Can Research Become
Ceremony? Performance Ethnography and Indigenous Epistemologies" appeared
in summer 2012 in the Canadian Theatre Review.
She will share a workshop called "Sharing Embodied Cultural Knowledge

visit www.ojibwe.net where she and her colleagues have created a space for
language that is shared by academics and the native community.
She will be work-shopping a chapter from a forthcoming book on Anishinaabe
narrative traditions which traces the way "oral" traditions are actually
"physical" performance traditions which carry thought into space and allow
us to exchange our interpretations of the world around as word which
becomes stage dialogue, story, lyrics or poetry.

I do! I do! He was what Kevin Killian and Lewis E, call in Spicer's bio a
"more conventional boyfriend" Spicer met as he was a "fixture in
Berthelon's Berkeley salon." I just glanced and haven't read it in year,
but Allen is mentioned numerous times in "poet be like God" I Love that
book! But it's a little hard to get and expensive ($40). Jen

Subject:      Seeking a new Political Editor for Unlikely Stories: Episode IV
In-Reply-To:  <5104DB95.1050901@unlikelystories.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

*Wanted:* The correct applicant for the unlikeliest job in
Web-literature, the Political Editor for /Unlikely Stories: Episode IV/.

/Unlikely Stories/, which has run more-or-less continuously since 1998,
began incorporating sociopolitical content into its regular publication
schedule in 2004. You remember 2004—a few unpleasantries were occurring,
but at the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department, led by the Bush
Administration, discovered that it /couldn’t/outlaw translations of
literature from Iran, Lybia, and Cuba—the outrage against them was too
great. We at /Unlikely/(then called /Unlikely 2.0/dove into cultural
commentary, and it’s been an integral part of our site since.

In 2012 we launched /Unlikely Stories: Episode IV/, and reduced our
focus on sociopolitical analyses, instead (mostly) shifting to firsthand
accounts of activism. These firsthand accounts, available all over the
‘Net and covering a broad range of activities and philosophies, are now
a core element of our monthly content. Political Editor Joseph Rose made
the transition smooth and effective, but he must now commit to other
things, and we seek his replacement.

The candidate should:

 1. Care about the arts and their role in society. This is a political
    position at an arts magazine. It exists because we at /Unlikely/feel
    that the line between arts and politics should be a lot blurrier
    than it typically is.
 2. Be prepared to commit up to twenty hours a month to reading
    political and activist content on the web, finding appropriate
    discussions, and requesting permission to reprint them at /Unlikely./
 3. Have the social skills necessary to request reprint rights, and care
    about Copyright and proper attribution, even if no one else on the
    Web does. See http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html and
    http://unlikelystories.org/05/hadley0805.shtml.
 4. Understand that, while the Political Editor is a fully autonomous
    editor who has broad control of their “fiefdom,” /Unlikely/’s
    political segments are deliberately woven with its art criticism
    segments, and this job therefore requires regularly working with
    /Unlikely/’s Editor-in-Chief, Jonathan Penton. And he’s batshit.


The candidate should consider:

 1. What do you feel is meant by “activism?” How do your own political
    assumptions come into play? Do you find /Unlikely/’s political
    opinions to be roughly compatible with your own? Are there changes
    you’d like to see?
 2. What sort of work would you like to bring to the department? Would
    you like to blog? Videoblog? Compile sets of related essays? Compile
    sets of essays in which the authors disagree?


If this sounds like it would bring you enjoyment and enrichment, sue
your parents for malpractice, verify that you’ve seen our submission
guidelines at http://www.unlikelystories.org/mission.shtml, and
introduce yourself to “us” at jonathan@unlikelystories.org.

And, no, it doesn’t pay. I run /Unlikely /at a loss, always have. If you
have some sort of wack-ass lit-career plan for which this job sounds
helpful, well, I’m happy to work with you on it.

The Art of Plumbing

	Beforetimes. Uranus culls his gilded camels and bathes in the Baikal,
        the Zaysan, the Lanao. He wades in low-lying planes; spas in every
        rain-filled meteor crater. Sixty-fourth parallel, March. Sunlight
        fires a salvo off his lovers collarbone. Gaias slums hoard water,
        asmat mud and patches of pubic forest. Her valleys are aqueducts
        feeding antechambers of lakes: caravans of bathtubs clawing
        overland talon by talon according to deep time, glacial wake,
        geochemistry. Lake Agassiz Basin. Morass hollow, calderas.
        Gathering my hair off the pillow, I rise from the spill on our
        sheets to bathe.

        OceanusTitan of the brackish Atlantic, master of Ketos and Kraken,
        conductor of sky to land. Half man, half serpent; horizon marks the
        fix. Biceps of accumulated cloud ceiling the sea. Hell rip your
        ship apart for a violin. His tails a womans braid dropped deep. And
        over its mucus and muscled carbuncles, legions of mollusc princes
        ascend, knot by knot by octopus tapiscrabs pincers and half-spumed
        clamsthrough bergs of cloying oil slick, plagues of dross,
        black-blooming purple, and a drowned Cassiopeia of phosphor.
        Abyssss. Germs fermenting in the kegs of their slow-moving shells.
        Up through the punch holes of Poseidons belt, out through the
        tunnels of his prosthetic manifold, svelte pipelines, immaculate
        tapsan invertebrate army comes to kiss the slit where my tail
        splits, two legs.

FABULOUS NIGHT OF MUSIC, POETRY & PURDY MEMORABILIA FEB. 6

Plan to attend Koerner Hall, 273 Bloor St. W, Toronto, Feb. 6 at 7:30 for
The Al Purdy Show, a great evening of music by Gord Downie, the Bidiniband
and Skydigger with readings by Margaret Atwood, Gordon Pinsent, Michael
Enright, Karen Solie, Ken Babstock, George Bowering, George Elliot Clarke,
Steve Heighton, Phil Hall, Dennis Lee and others, all to raise money to
restore the Al Purdy A-frame! Click Purdyana above for catalogue of rare
Purdy memorabilia to be auctioned.

TICKETS NOW ON SALE! http://rcmusic.ca/event/al-purdy-show

See news for more details.

About the Al Purdy A-frame Project:

    So we built a house, my wife and I
    our house at a backwater puddle of a lake
    near Ameliasburg, Ont.
    Al Purdy In Search of Owen Roblin

And that A-frame house, made out of second-hand lumber and original
poetry, became the most famous writers house in the country. Hundreds of
writers and their housemates found their way to Roblin Lake to visit the
Purdys and talk about poetry and history while downing beer or wild grape
wine. Coleridge and his friends had their lake country, and now the
Canadian poets would have theirs. A lot of poetry and prose came out of
that hard-to-find place.

To prevent its second-hand wood from ending up on someones scrap heap, and
with the blessing and support of Als widow, Eurithe Purdy, The Purdy
A-frame Association raised funds to purchase the property and is now
raising more funds to preserve it, create an endowment and establish a
poet-in-residence program.

Subject:      The First Poem Transmitted At The Speed of Light
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In 1794 the Swedish inventor and poet Niclas Edelcrantz sent a poem by
optical telegraph dedicated to the Swedish King on his birthday from the
Palace in Stockholm to the King at Drottningholm.  The words of the poem
were encoded in a language of collapsing iron shutters, which were
decodable as numbers, which in turn rendered up words, letters, phrases.
 A series of towers topped with collapsing iron shutters and manned by
men who knew just when how and why to collapse and restore them, passed
the poem along in the same manner that native Americans used smoke
signals.  The Optical Telegraph was a whizz-bang bit of technology if
there ever was one.  My source for this golden bit is the Wikipedia.
God bless you all, or rather What Hath God Wrought?.  Jess

Homework:  Encode this information into a language of collapsing shutters.

Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the release of:

VOICE STUDIES 11 & 12

David Blamey

VS 011 (2013)

20 minute double sided cassette

Side A ? O.K.
Side B ? O.K.

As a visual artist, David Blamey has a knack for finding patterns of formalism
in everyday life that, when augmented through acts of repetition or prolonged
attention, break down and unravel in interesting ways. At the critical point of
collapse within this method there exists an opportunity for subjects to
transcend themselves: to be elevated from their material constraints into a
higher realm of possibility.

This new sound piece evolved from an ink drawing made in India that simply
states: ?O.K.? The banality of the word would seem to offer little in the way
of musical promise, yet when repeated over time our awareness becomes drawn to
subtle inflections within its minimal neutrality. In due course any meaning
that the word may have once held is lost and something else transpires. With
references to club culture, meditation tapes and conceptual art, this project
serves as a droll mantra for uncertain times.

Dear Professor Damon ,
I'm writing to draw your attention to a large international conference
on Emily Dickinson this summer at the University of Maryland and
American University.  I invite you to submit a proposal for the
conference, and also to spread the word to students and colleagues who
are working on Dickinson.

For its 25th anniversary, the Emily Dickinson International Society is
sponsoring a conference, Aug 9-11, entitled Emily Dickinson, World
Citizen <http://emilydickinsoninternationalsociety.org/node/123>. You
can click on CFP
<http://www.emilydickinsoninternationalsociety.org/node/329> here; it's
also attached and pasted it in below. As you'll see, we're especially
interested in "innovative and alternative presentation modes (such as
pecha kucha and artistic performances)," and in contributions that
stretch the theme of Emily Dickinson, World Citizen
<http://emilydickinsoninternationalsociety.org/node/123>. She did, after
all, gather "Paradise" in her "narrow Hands."

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me Marianne
Noble (mnoble@american.edu <mailto:mnoble@american.edu>) or Martha Nell
Smith (mnsmith@umd.edu <mailto:mnsmith@umd.edu>) directly or the
conference committee at edis-2013-conference@umd.edu
<mailto:edis-2013-conference@umd.edu>. We hope you will join us for a
wonderful time rowing in Eden and basking in poetry.


In Possibility,
Marianne Noble
Emily Dickinson International Society (EDIS)


EDIS 2013 International Conference: Ã¢Â€ÂœEmily Dickinson, World CitizenÃ¢Â€Â

University of Maryland and American University

College Park, MD and Washington, D.C.

http://www.emilydickinsoninternationalsociety.org/node/123

On August 9-11, 2013, the University of Maryland and American University
will co-sponsor an Emily Dickinson International Society (EDIS)
international conference in the Washington, D.C. area.  To celebrate 25
years of EDIS fostering intellectual and artistic exchange, Ã¢Â€ÂœEmily
Dickinson, World CitizenÃ¢Â€Â will explore DickinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s various forms of
belonging and ways in which multiple constituencies Ã¢Â€ÂœbelongÃ¢Â€Â to her,
her world. The poet herself may have seen Ã¢Â€ÂœNew Englandly, Ã¢Â€Â but as a
cosmopolitan reader, she crafted and cultivated numerous affiliations
beyond the local. This conference explores her politics, her
understanding of citizenship, her engagements with international
cultures and influences, as well as those culturesÃ¢Â€Â™ diverse
engagements with her writings.  The focus of the conferenceÃ¢Â€Â™s critical
and artistic inquiries is the global reach of her mind and verse from
the nineteenth century to the present.

Ã¢Â€ÂœEmily Dickinson, World CitizenÃ¢Â€Â will take extensive advantage of
the many historical and cultural resources in the D.C. area. Anticipated
highlights include high tea at the Willard Hotel, where Emily Dickinson
stayed when she visited her Representative father and where Julia Ward
Howe wrote Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Battle Hymn of the RepublicÃ¢Â€Â; a lecture and/or
exhibition, followed by a reception, at the National Museum of Women in
the Arts; a dinner and reception at American University; a poetry
reading by some who consider the DC/Maryland area home; and what Emily
Dickinson would surely demand if she were coming Ã¢Â€Â”a crabfest, with
alternatives of course for those who do not eat shellfish.

For this conference in Ã¢Â€ÂœScarlet Maryland, Ã¢Â€Â we invite proposals for
papers, performances, panel sessions, and other critical and artistic
responses to the theme Ã¢Â€ÂœEmily Dickinson, World Citizen.Ã¢Â€Â  Innovative
and alternative presentation modes (such as pecha kucha) are encouraged.
  Presentations of research not directly related to the conference theme
are also invited.  Our Ã¢ Â€ÂœworldingÃ¢Â€Â of Emily Dickinson includes using
21st century media for our knowledge exchange.  To that end, abstracts
of the presentations will be made available to all participants at least
30 days before the conference.  Please submit proposals for papers,
performances, panels to edis-2013-conference@umd.edu
<mailto:edis-2013-conference@umd.edu> by February 15, 2013.
  Notifications of acceptances will be sent no later than February 28, 2013.

Look for updates on the conference at

Maria, I never think of myself being related to anyone (certainly not to Ja=
mes Joyce), and there are a surprising number of Joyces out there, so I alm=
ost overlooked this notice. However, I think Allen Joyce actually is a cous=
in of mine. I know little about that sector of my family due to the schism =
which occurred when my grandfather took up with my grandmother when his wif=
e was pregnant with their ninth child. However, I do know that Allen was bo=
rn in Hawaii in 1930. His father, Allen R. Joyce, was a commander of submar=
ines, partly during WWII, and he retired as a Rear Admiral. I think he was =
based in San Diego. My father told me not too long ago that Allen Jr. was g=
ay. I am investigating this further and will back channel with more details=
. I am fairly sure that I can contact Allen's nephew and gather more detail=

Dear all,
For 10 years the different Antwerp City Poets were a beacon of Freedom of
Speech, a conscience for the City Council and a voice for the people of
Antwerp.
For ten years, Tom Lanoye, Ramsey Nasr, Bart Moeyaert, Joke van Leeuwen,
Peter Holvoet-Hanssen and now Bernard Dewulf have been proud defenders of
the free verse and Poetry.
(http://www.antwerpen.be/eCache/ABE/81/35/307.html)

Now they need your support!

In an article in Flemish quality newspaper "De Standaard" (
http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=3DDMF20130130_010) th=
e
right winged flemish nationalistic party NV-A proposes to stop the
institute of the Antwerp City Poet.
Due to the fact that these people are or badly informed about what the
Antwerp City Poet is doing for poetry, language and integration or because
of the fact that this right wing party sees the Antwerp City Poet as a
remnant of 10 years "left wing influence" on society or just want to stop
the unique way the Antwerp City Poet format works - the Antwerp City Poet
is completely free and can speak and write about whatever s/he wants and it
will be made public regardless of the fact if it is pro or contra the
reigning mayor or parties.
The NV-A has been very eager to use philosophy, popular misconceptions and
lies to discredit the arts as a way of freedom of expression and not as a
propaganda tool for the right wing nationalistic Flemish nation state
making.
The president of the Flemish Parliament (member of NV-A) as well as mayor
of Antwerp (the president of the NV-A) and different other NV-A politicians
and thinkers are constantly trying to shut up all dissident voices in
Antwerp and in Flanders.
As we see currently in Hungary, but also in other countries around the
world, dissident voices to the nationalistic narrow far right way of
thinking are being silenced by portraying the dissident voices as enemies
of the(ir) state (vision) and so stopping funding with common popular
consent or even worse convicting them to prison.
I took the freedom to add the links to these articles underneath here so  -
with the help of a (google) translator you can read them for yourself and
assess the danger first hand.

As you know, I'm - not only in my poetry but also in my day-to-day life -
an advocate of freedom of speech everywhere in the world.
On Facebook there is a group - since today - which is "Safe the City Poet" =
(
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Red-de-Stadsdichter/148087885348800)

As most of you have met or been in touch with the unique way the Antwerp
City Poet works and since you are all very much in favour of Freedom of
Speech as active poets, exiled or organisers, I send you this plea to go to
the facebook page and like it, leaving a comment and/or writing about this
threat to the freedom of speech in the centre of Europe.

I thank you for sending your letters of support to Michael Vandebril and/or
to publish them online, sharing them with us all.

Hoping that the voice of the City Poet of Antwerp will not be deafened.

Read the Charter of Peter Holvoet Hanssen, the previous city poet here:

severtaling.pdf


All the best,
Philip

The Lewis Ellingham Papers at UCSD have several letters sent between Joyce
and Spicer if you're looking for more than you can find in the bio.

Whoa, Elisabeth, that is definitely the same guy.

I gathered from friends of Allen's that, at the time he met Spicer, he was
sort of what was once called a "remittance man,"that his family gave him
an allowance on condition he stayed away (maybe not in so many words).

What a small world and to have it emerge on the Poetics List, there's a
strange beauty in this.  Please keep me posted on your further
investigations.  Your cousin haunts me, and the letters and poems Spicer
wrote to him are about as warm as he got,

Cheers from San Francisco,

Kevin K.

If post-post-modern poetry is more process than product with Poetic
Effort (PE) taking precedence over Poetic Product (PP), then perhaps
further analysis might allow us to posit two broad fields of
post-post-modernity in (at least) American poetry: Drive-Thru poetics
(High PE, LOW PP), in which the poet attempts to service the reader to
the extent that he or she successfully services herself; and Drive-By
poetics (HIGH PP, HIGH TO LOWER MIDDLE PE), in which the poem as
aesthetic object, able to be "bought, and sold"--if even in a token
sense, is still discernible against the phenomenological back-drop of PE.

Wow, that's fascinating. Turns out he was an early lover/boyfriend of
Spicer's and they remained good friends.
I wonder what more you'll learn.
Thanks so much!

	I. Embarking

	Should my point of departure be the dust
	to which I will return? Or the water of which
	I am composed? Or

	I'm told the poet asked, are birds free
	from the chains of the skyway?
	So I depart from air.

	One accustomed to the sea takes not long
	to trust airs buoyancy.
	So let breath be

	the place we start from. Let the sun
	rise in our wake and our ship shudder
	as we descend through cloud.

	The river below, a forked black tongue
	darting through the snow, I named
	for the patron of cooks, put to death on a grill.

	The maps I drew four centuries ago
	I compare with land from the vantage of birds
	and am not dissatisfied.
