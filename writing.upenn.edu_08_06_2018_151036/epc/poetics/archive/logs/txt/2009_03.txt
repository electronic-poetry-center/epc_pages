That's what the right wing columnists claim, but from where I'm
looking the truth is a lot more complex than that. I've dealt with
funding bodies from several sides of the fence (critic, applicant,
peer review person) in several art forms (music, literature, theatre).
What counts more than "who you know" - and I'm not saying this is
necessarily a good thing - is being able to argue a coherent
application. It's surprising how few writers manage to do this, and
yet one would think it would be obvious that in approaching a
bureaucracy, what needs to be assuaged is the bureaucratic
necessities. And in a way, that's fair enough: render unto Caesar what
is Caesar's.

The Australian Council has a pretty transparent process: those who
want to know about how decisions were made can find out, decisions can
be questioned and there are strict rules about conflict of interest in
panel discussions that are - from what I've seen - rigorously
observed. When I look at the "stimulus spending" being thrown around
these days my head spins - the arts have to account for every penny,
and it's so jealously scrutinised. That seems correct for public
money, but then private industry gets millions of dollars and aside
from a few dissenting voices, everybody's for it. Hmmm.

Fwiw, I've spent some time looking at US and UK funding models, and I
think the Australian system looks pretty good in comparison (although
it also looks pretty poor in relation to some imaginative European
models): it's pretty fair, all things considered, and the major
problem it faces is actually lack of money. There are big caveats:
it's been pretty disastrous for the film industry, mainly I guess
because films require so much money comapred to other artforms; the
most interesting films being made these days are pirate films done on
privately raised and miniscule budgets and filmed on HDD by people who
don't get paid anything. On the other hand, the reason we have such a
lively and interesting theatre culture is that it's funded,
independent theatre especially; the main stage theatre companies get
very little public funding, when considered as a percentage of their
income, and so tend to operate more like commercial theatres.

Like I said, it's complex. I still think it's better to have public
funding than not, or at least, I can't think of a better way of making
up the deficit of making serious art. And if you want unscrutinised
funding predicated on "who you know", then private patronage is the
absolute model. Myself, I usually feel about funding bodies like the
scriptwriters in Barton Fink do about producers: "He's taking an
interest, Barton! It's a _disaster_!" Bureaucrats, being the least
interested, are probably the least damaging for artists to deal with.

Funny thing is, you're right about the anti-market position. The market is =
in fact the most democratic determiner of artistic merit (much to the horro=
r of the elitists here), while also allowing room for people to have access=
 to works that fit their own tastes. In a pure democracy, we would only lis=
ten to Britney Spears. Under democratic-government-controlled arts, we woul=
d only listen to music that is inoffensive to everyone (I'm guessing someth=
ing along the lines of 50's soft pop rock). Only in the free market can I l=
isten to Franz Ferdinand and Modest Mouse. Incidentally, one of the reasons=
 why I set up the Emerson Institute was to truly democratize patronage of t=
he arts -- in a way that was 100% voluntary. Equality under the law, yes; c=
ollectivist egalitarianism, no. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A_____________=

You are mistaking "the market" for "democracy." You are correct to make a d=
istinction between the market and individuals. One thing that the market do=
es allow is the creation of niches. Mass production is not identical with t=
he market, though it can be a feature of it. If there is enough people who =
want something, someone will come along to supply it. That is the main feat=
ure of the market. Certainly with copy prices so low, and the existence of =
the internet, and now Kindle, the availability of art of all sorts have blo=
ssomed. I see the development of things such as the Kindle -- a product of =
the market -- as a way for many more people to be able to sell their litera=
ry works, since almost all costs have been eliminated for publishers. And a=
s the market allows for the creation of more and more such technology, it's=
 going to be easier and easier for writers to make their works available fo=
r sale. We are at the cusp of another information boom, which will
 make literary works far more available -- and the government far less nece=
ssary. =0A=0AThe market produces a wide variety of things, including kitsch=
 -- but most certainly kitsch is not the only thing it produces. If you tru=
ly believe it is, then you have chosen to blind yourself to much of reality=
, I'm afraid. Or perhaps you ought to get out of Canada more often.=0A=0ATr=

It's good to see someone south of the boarder standing up for government fu=
nding in Canadian arts. Thanks Francois. To add to that, it is the governme=
nt funding allows all the talented writers (particularly the ones mentioned=
 below) to create their work and distribute it, because although their work=
 is brilliant, it's not easily digestible (in terms of what the market requ=
ires for consumption), and therefore opposed to the principles that govern =
"the market".=0A=0AHowever, a major problem that I noticed from the start o=
f this debate is that it is taking for granted (in life, in this conversati=
on) that "the market" indeed has skills of discernment. The market cannot r=
ecognize anything. It's not a person, nor does it have eyes, or thoughts, o=
r feelings. Though "the market" may require humans to exist or to perpetuat=
e itself, human "taste" (as relative and arbitrary as that may be) plays a =
minuscule role in determining what is produced by the market. In order for =
the market to operate as it does, it requires "efficiency" (translate: chea=
p products, made quickly, sold for a lot of money). Human desire comes into=
 play at one point or another, but psychoanalysts and cultural theorists ac=
ross the board have demonstrated time and again that desire is just as easi=
ly appeased with simulation and simulacra as it is with the "authentic" thi=
ng. =0A=0ATherefore, the market generates "schlock and kitsch" (as the big =
ol' F.J. puts it) in order to sustain itself. The subject who is fully imme=
rsed in the market--that is the ideal market-subject who can supposedly dis=
cern--is equally satisfied with kitsch as it is with anything else. =0A=0AP=
erhaps you're not. And I think, neither are most people on this listserv. W=
hich is the point I'm making.=0A=0ASo three cheers for government funding f=

HIstory shows the people in government are far, far, far more corrupt, and =
that government is far more corrupting, than are those who participate in t=
he free market, or than the free market is. =0A=0AI don't deny the importan=

nconsistent with the market economy. In fact, there is a long history of ve=
ry wealthy capitalists who were incredibly generous with their largesse. Wh=
ich is to be compared with government leaders, who are incredibly generous =
with your largesse. It's easy -- and at least amoral -- to be generous with=
 other people's money. So patronage is important. I think it should come ab=
out voluntarily. You think it is perfectly acceptable to take money by forc=
e (try not to pay your taxes and see if it isn't taken by force). That is w=
here we disagree. In fact, I think patronage is so important, I have starte=
d a nonprofit organization to provide patronage for the arts. We won't take=
 money form the government, though, as I find taking money from the governm=
ent to be unethical. We will take voluntary donations from people so that w=

 etc. So be careful what you're accusing people of.=0A=0AThere is no such t=

In a public chat in the SCAT television studios in Somerville, these two =

Troy,

The market consists of people who can afford (affordability must come along
with willingness) to buy things. In other words, the market does not
necessarily have to include the poor in its "benevolent," "natural" loop.
This is something to keep in mind as our country, and the world, seem to be
moving inexorably towards depression.

Ciao,

Murat

After much turmoil and eternal thanks to Sugar Seville

There's a new installation at the site. The particle count is low, about 1/8 of
what it was on Ian's Hybrid OCAD. I took out the other uneditable particle
scripts from the building prims with a dead particle script. The object count
is low. This should be ok for now. I'm documenting now so it doesn't have to

Are you kidding, Troy? Only if we  want high art to consist of poker playing
dogs  is the market "the most democratic determiner of artistic merit"!
There are times when democracy is the worst possible determiner. If it had
been allowed to determine things, blacks would still be slaves as the
Emancipation Proclamation was probably the most hated piece of legislation
ever and popular support was vastly against it.

Funny thing is, you're right about the anti-market position. The market is
in fact the most democratic determiner of artistic merit (much to the horror
of the elitists here), while also allowing room for people to have access to
works that fit their own tastes. In a pure democracy, we would only listen
to Britney Spears. Under democratic-government-controlled arts, we would
only listen to music that is inoffensive to everyone (I'm guessing something
along the lines of 50's soft pop rock). Only in the free market can I listen
to Franz Ferdinand and Modest Mouse. Incidentally, one of the reasons why I
set up the Emerson Institute was to truly democratize patronage of the arts
-- in a way that was 100% voluntary. Equality under the law, yes;
collectivist egalitarianism, no.

The problem with Paul Nelson's objection to Troy's notion that a free market
is a good
judge of artistic merit is that it means Paul has put himself in an
untenable position:
he's implicitly arguing that some poems are better than others, and that
some people
can tell which ones those poems are -- it's an elitist position, one that
will get him in a
lot of trouble if he's not careful, and get him lumped in with Troy as an
equality-hater.
Be careful, Paul! You just can't say that some poems are better than others,
or some
poets better than others, without getting accused of elitism!

You're not an elitist, are you, Paul?

I'm a liberal, not on "the right".

There is a value to understanding how things work even for liberals.

However postmodern or leftist you may be, I'll bet you still go the doctor when you're
sick; I'll bet you don't doubt whether jerking the steering wheel to the side will put you
in a ditch; I'll bet you don't simply step out of a flying airplane when it comes to your
destination city; I'll bet you don't tighten bolts while hoping to loosen them, or eat your
own feces under the impression it's food. The world works the way it really works, no
matter what unlikely theory you may be under the sway of regarding art.

Dear Troy,

"HIstory shows the people in government are far, far, far more corrupt, and
that government is far more corrupting, than are those who participate in
the free market."

Oh come now: history is written by free market wonks! I'm glad to see you're
a patron of great grammar and fine language skills, but for the love of G-d,
why are you buying into this propaganda? What history books are you reading?


Where are you getting your information from?

Not really.

Of course, it's been hard to know what a free market is for the past
several millennia. And market suppliers, free or otherwise, are
usually in some sort of partnership with government.

Wrong, Troy, on both counts.

History shows that privilege corrupts, whatever form it may take -- and it doesn't matter
where privilege comes from, it corrupts equally across all classes and modes of life.
There is no such thing as a government more corrupt than a market, or a market more
corrupt than a government. People will always find a way to cheat to get ahead, and
those who do will be privileged over those who don't, and those who are privileged will
find a way to institutionalize their privilege.

In fact proponents of government and of the market are in a constant balancing act,
each trying to catch the other out in their inevitable corruptions. Markets without
regulatory governments are brutalizing; governments without liberating markets are
brutalizing. Even without transparency in regulation and operation governments and
markets balance one another to a limited extent. But the more transparency there is in
both regulation and market operation the better the balance between governments and
markets work.

The problem isn't government/market, or left/right; the problem is people are perfectly
willing to lie and cheat under any system to gain privilege for themselves, their families,
and their friends, and then try to institutionalize those privileges for their own, and their
progeny's, advantage.

Under any form of social organization the liars and cheaters will gain privilege and
institutionalize those privileges. The struggle is to marginalize the liars and cheaters
and maximize transparency of operation in order to make it just a little more likely that
the people willing to accede to the rules and work hard within them will not have their
gains stolen from them by the liars and cheaters.

But the temptation to lie a little and cheat a little is endemic to the human animal. You
can see it in operation even in gift economies where if you disagree with the people in
charge they'll kick you out of the discussion group, or put you on read-only status and
prevent you from joining in even if you can read what others say.

Wait a minute, now! What's this? "most valuable"? Where does this come from? On
what grounds is some art "most valuable" while other art is not "most valuable"? How
do you measure merit in the arts, Allison? How do you determine what art is "most
valuable"?

But John, what's wrong with poker-playing dogs? What's wrong with the market as a
democratic determiner of merit? I thought that's what all the postmodernists WANT is
to eliminate the very elitist notion that there's something wrong with poker-playing
dogs. Nothing is better than anything else -- everything is equal in merit and value;
anything is art that anyone says is art! How can you possibly claim that anything is
better or worse, or that there is more or less merit to this or that kind of art? On what
grounds do you hold that poker-playing dogs are meritless, or at least of less merit
than ... than what, John? What do you say is better, and why do you say it is better,
than poker-playing dogs?

Just so -- because you know jerking it to the left will put you in a ditch. We're agreed
on that.

But don't you see that once we're agreed on that it vitiates the whole of postmodernist
relativism? It is simply not the case that everything is the same as everything else; not
the case that any one thing is as valuable as any other thing; not the case that one
effort is just as valuable as a different effort; not the case that anything is art that
anyone says is art?

Of course I agree with that.
I just don't see how the market can come before governments
]and also not before governments.

Actually, to quote Lord Acton, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power =
corrupts absolutely." Where power is spread out, there is less corruption; =
where power is concentrated, there is more corruption. Certainly there are =
cheaters in every group, in every system. But insofar as market economies s=
pread out power quite a bit, and insofar as government concentrate power qu=
ite a bit, government are necessarily more corrupt than are markets. More, =
the structures of government tend to protect corruption more than does the =
market. Cheaters exposed in government often are rewarded; cheaters exposed=
 in the economy often lose their wealth (there are exceptions to both cases=
, but the exceptions do not negate the rule). I'm certainly no anarchist, s=
o I'm not arguing for no role for government. There is a role in providing =
equal protection under the law (which is another way of saying that governm=
ent should only have laws that are able to be applied to everybody
 equally, and of which everybody is equally the beneficiary). There is a ro=
le for the enforcement of contracts voluntarily entered into and the enforc=
ement of laws against murder, lying/cheating, and theft (I also think gover=
nments should not engage in such actions). You are otherwise correct about =
any social system necessarily having cheaters in it. The question is, what =
rules will marginalize the cheaters? Transparency laws and labeling laws ar=
e thus important and necessary. And transparency should extend to the gover=
nment as well. We have lacked transparency in government for a long time, a=
nd it has only gotten worse over the past 8 years -- and it doesn't look li=
ke it's going to get any better with the current administration. =0A=0ATroy=

You only prove my point with such statement. Not that I'm not in agreement =
with you that Dogs Playing Poker isn't really what I'm looking for in high =
art. What you missed was what came after the comma. The market also allows =
for persuasion. People can be educated to learn what is good and what is no=
t good. The same person who has Dogs Playing Poker in his basement would be=
 terribly disappointed to find such a work in his museum when he went to vi=
sit. There is a difference between what people like in a general sort of wa=
y and what people acknowledge to be great works of art. My wife, for exampl=
e, thinks that opera is literally the best way to spend an evening. But she=
 also listens to Shakira. If you read the rest of my posting, you will note=
 that I differentiate between what the market does in allowing for niches a=
nd true democracy, where there is a tyranny of the majority. In that case, =
one would in fact get Dogs Playing Poker as high art. This is
 precisely why I'm not a fan of democratic government supporting the arts.=

You are correct to a certain extent. But the market also makes things incre=
asingly cheaper, so that the poor of today have a higher standard of living=
 than the middle class of a hundred years ago and the rich of rich of three=
 hundred years ago. No telling how long that will last in the near future f=
or a while since, as you point out, we seem to be moving inexorably towards=
 depression. If you want to know what if any of Obama's ideas are going to =
get us out of the economy, watch what the stock market does in response. Ac=
tions they deem harmful to the economy results in the market going down; ac=
tions they deem helpful to the economy results in the market going up (this=
 is the case only when the government is actively doing things which affect=
 the economy, and not during regular times). The stock market has dropped o=
ver 12% since Obama became President, mostly during the times when he has f=
ought for the "stimulus" and "bailout" money. I'm a little less
 pessimistic that the stimulus law will harm the economy in the immediate f=
uture since there is so little in there for this year (which seems odd, sin=
ce a stimulus should have everything in it for the year of the recession), =
though the truly insane deficits he has racked up in the first month of off=
ice will probably (with the rest of the debt we have accumulated) destroy t=
he economy sometime in the future. These kinds of deficits only move doomsd=
ay up considerably.=0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A__________________________=

Marcus, I think some things are better than others. Most people do;
and then they have arguments about it. It's called "culture".

Oh well,  I haven't read the right wing columnists. And I have no idea
of 'the truth' about arts funding, just my observations & experiences
since OzCo was set up in the early 70s

But it could be beneficial if the OzCo literature board publicised the
names of the 'peers' for each round of grants before anyone applies.
Then you needn't put the effort into arguing 'a coherent' or any other
kind of application if you were forewarned who was to be part of the
decision making. (Who would apply to their own detractors - peers or
not?)

That might also cut the number of applicants - making for a more
cheerful bureaucracy.

Other useful tactics would be to introduce means testing of applicants
and excluding recent financially- lucrative-prize-winners  from
applying in the year of the prize. It's looked to me over the decades
that you win a prize then immediately go for a grant and get it.

Do I sound like a socialist ?   (and, yes, I have heard of Joseph Stalin)

Whatever happened to proper seed money - I reckon the grant system, as
well-meaning as it was and says it is - makes being awarded a grant
look more like winning a prize than anything else these days, as the
years of celebrity and spectacle keep rolling along.

So where are the ghost-grant-application-writers ? A small business
idea for retired arts admin functionaries ?

Businesses have to account too - there is quarterly PAYG and company
tax etc and welfare agencies and other government-funded bodies like
schools and hospitals...all have to account. It's our money. It's tax.
It's not only the poor old arts sector that has to 'account for every
penny'
(I wanted desperately to say 'yartz sector' just then but I don't want
to be demoralised by Les Patterson ever again ! I can't take much more
of him !)

Good oh - I'll take your word for it.

Maybe some different methods of distribution of the monies the OzCo
literature board does receive would be an improvement.   The seed
money thing again - spread it around.
For instance - have  many more smaller amounts of money for individual
writers rather than those whoppers of fellowships (although I could
certainly find ways to spend a fellowship over a year or two - quel
luxe)

Agreed.   (see - I'm left of socialism, actually)

Funny art should get some money too, no ?

No no, I don't - but, but, - we don't have much of that in Oz, do we ?
Is that why I kept that day job for so long?
Sob, is it because I don't know anybody who's anybody in private patronage?

But, Alison, in the 'arms-length', 'transparent' peer system you
report, Bureaucrats R Us.

Bye for now,
Pam,

who want something=2C someone will come along to supply it. That is the mai=
n feature of the market. Certainly with copy prices so low=2C and the exist=
ence of the internet=2C and now Kindle=2C the availability of art of all so=
rts have blossomed. I see the development of things such as the Kindle -- a=
 product of the market -- as a way for many more people to be able to sell =
their literary works=2C since almost all costs have been eliminated for pub=
lishers. And as the market allows for the creation of more and more such te=
chnology=2C it's going to be easier and easier for writers to make their wo=
rks available for sale. We are at the cusp of another information boom=2C w=

--------------------------------------------


June 2008: Refocussed List Policy
In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email us at poetics.list --at -- gmail.com, subject-line
"registration," with your full name, street address, email address,
and telephone number. Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed frorm the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always =A9 the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

7. Flaming
"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the

Dear Friends,=20

This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Belladonna
Series, curated by Rachel Levitsky and Erica Kaufman in New
York City.  To celebrate the occasion, the editors are
celebrating artists who have influenced the members of this
community of conversation, and publishing 8 perfect bound
books=8Bone a month. The =B3Elders Series=B2 is guest-curated. Each
book, printed as a one-time limited edition (276 - 326 copies
ONLY), is beautifully designed and slightly square-shaped
(6x7). Each contains the work of the two or three people who
read the night the book is released. The books are considered
conversations between writers who are in dialogue.

About Belladonna*:

Belladonna* began as a reading and salon series at
Bluestocking=B9s Women=B9s Bookstore on New York City=B9s Lower East
Side in August 1999. In June 2000, in collaboration with Boog
Literature, Belladonna* began to publish commemorative
=8Cchaplets=B9 of the readers=B9 work (the entire series is
available by subscription to individual collectors and
libraries). This year marks the tenth anniversary of our
mission to promote the work of women writers who are
adventurous, experimental, politically involved, multi-form,
multicultural, multi-gendered, impossible to define, delicious
to talk about, unpredictable, and dangerous with language.
Belladonna* has featured over 150 writers of wildly diverse
age and origin, writers who work in conversation and
collaboration within and between multiple forms, languages,
critical fields. As performance and as printed text, the work
collects, gathers over time and space, and forms a kind of
conversation about the feminist avant-garde, what it is and
how it comes to be. Our anniversary Elders Series is a
continuation of this conversation, which highlights the fact
of influence and continuity of the ideas, poetics, and
concerns we circle through.

By this argument you'd have to concede that unions, because they spread power out
over the whole union membership, cannot be as corrupt as the management of an
individual company, which concentrates power, and that, therefore, unions are good
and management is bad. It's your argument that's bad, though, because you cannot
generalize from it to all instances -- or, more accurately, when we do, you reject some
of the conclusions and accept others on grounds that have nothing to do with "power"
and everything to do with ideology.

I can refute this outright from my own experience. When I was a legislative aide to a
US Senator who was on the Judiciary Committee, the law was that no one could own
more than 5 radio and 5 tv stations, and 5 newspapers, and they could not be in the
same markets. At that time, however, the Justice Department was suing both IBM and
ATT for monopolistic practices. I got a phone call from a lawyer asking me two simple
questions: how many attorneys are there in the Justice Department working on the
IBM and ATT cases, and how many attorneys are there altogether in the JD? He then,
he told me years later, on the basis of the fact that almost all the attorneys at Justice
were involved in one or the other of the big cases, and airline and trucking deregulation
were the next big projects, advised his client to go ahead and buy radio and tv stations,
and newspapers, whether they were in the same market or not, because no one was
watching.

Not only did that guy do it, but so did a lot of other people. What was Congress's
reaction when, finally, after years of litigation with IBM, ATT, and the airline and
trucking industries, the fact that there were people who owned dozens of radio and tv
stations and newspapers quite illegally, often in the same markets? They changed the
law to accommodate the illegal business practices.

The corruption was not in the government, it was in the market. People lie, steal, and
cheat at every opportunity, and when they have cheated enough to be very very rich
can institutionalize their cheating.

It's all too true that there is corruption in government, but the corruption is works its
way into government from the market, not the other way around. In this case,
Congress didn't have the nerve to put a whole bunch of rich people in jail, and besides,
Reagan had just won an election by then, and the first eight years of darkness had
begun.

The market has no effective mechanism to regulate practices among those who trade
in that market because any means that produce profit are seen by the market to be
legitimate means, irrespective of how those means might be viewed from a moral or a
legal perspective. What government does is provide a countervailing force to the profit
motive on grounds that are moral, and, thus, outside the ambit of the market.

Given a free market, nothing is illegal -- actions are either profitable or not, but that is
all. No market is really free, though, is it? There are always pesky rules and laws and
regulations that prevent murder, slavery, prostitution, drugs, and other profitable lines
of business from being freely practiced.

When you're trading favors with your kin and neighbors in a non-market economy, the
normative morality prevails, and what we would regard as good business practices,
such as enforcing contracts, collecting interest and rent, getting paid in full and on
time, and the like, simply don't work very well because the community's moral
disapproval of someone who'd put his brother in law in jail for debt and his sister in the
poor-house is stronger than the pain of the loss of debt forgiveness. Business doesn't
thrive in that sort of community because there is no market.

Early markets are regulated by the local strong-man's whim and caprice; better-
established markets are regulated by some larger political entity's tax interest; mature
markets are able to influence the laws by which they are regulated. In every case the
market (such as it may be) and the government (such as it may be) are partners in the
enterprise.

It is, in short (too late, I know) not the case that the government is some kind of leech
on the life-blood of the market, nor is the market some necessary evil the government
must endure. On the contrary, the market and the government are full partners in the
establishment of a political economy, peace, prosperity, and stability. The government
is fully involved in the market, not merely the ownner of the army at the border.

The market without the government, the market with its own private army and police
and rules, doesn't operate as a marketplace where price, service, and quality
competition work to provide a wide variety of goods and services at a wide variety of
prices and qualities. The representatives of a market without a government are simply
thieves -- they take what they please at the price they please, and they do as they
please. Of course we've seen in the various totalitarian communist regimes over the
last 90 years what government without markets does: pretty much the same.

What you don't seem to see is that there is a necessity for regulating markets by
government because markets cannot regulate themselves by values outside that of
profitability. And profitability is simply inadequate as the highest value for human life.

"The market also allows for persuasion. People can be educated to learn wha=
t is good and what is not good." And who is going to do that education, Tro=
y? The marketing department? I think we already have such situation. I mean=
, aren't Shakira and Britney Spears more popular because they have a bigger=
 marketing department than say, New Model Army?=0A=0AIn all seriousness, yo=
ur argument is based on magical thinking. There is no account for naturally=
 occurring taste, especially in a free market. What you base your argument =
on is, one, that all people are reasonable, two, that reason will lead them=
 toward goodness. There are however no evidence for this assertion, much li=
ke there is no evidence for the free market being able to nurture art as we=
 understand it. In the contrary, state-funded art goes back all the way to =
the Antiquity. Who funded the Parthenon, for example? Or Leonardo receiving=
 his funding from Francis I of France? An example of an artistic situation =
within a free market context? Try Germany in the 1930s (just because the Na=
zi have "Socialist" in their name does not make them socialists. Being in t=
he pocket of Mercedes and Krupp proves it), with the painters of the Neue S=
achlichkeit being persecuted because their art was not marketable to the Ge=
rman populace.=0A=0Afran=E7ois luong=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A________________________=

 Economy=0A=0AYou only prove my point with such statement. Not that I'm not=
 in agreement with you that Dogs Playing Poker isn't really what I'm lookin=

t also allows for persuasion. People can be educated to learn what is good =
and what is not good. The same person who has Dogs Playing Poker in his bas=
ement would be terribly disappointed to find such a work in his museum when=
 he went to visit. There is a difference between what people like in a gene=
ral sort of way and what people acknowledge to be great works of art. My wi=
fe, for example, thinks that opera is literally the best way to spend an ev=
ening. But she also listens to Shakira. If you read the rest of my posting,=
 you will note that I differentiate between what the market does in allowin=

perhaps we could all limit ourselves to one post per day.  that way, the
conversation wouldn't be controlled by the person who types the fastest.

and that person might take a little more time and post more thoughtful
essays which would explore his own thinking a little more, and spew erratic
sound-bites a little less.

Hi Pam - sorry if you know how to suck eggs; didn't mean to sound that
way. I too am speaking from my experience. And I am kind of fascinated
by arts funding, the nuts and bolts of making art seem to me quite
important, and have indeed spent quite a bit of time reading about
different systems. And literature is only one aspect - there are other
art forms that ozco also looks at, and they don't necessarily work in
the same way as literature does. Also, I put a lot of caveats in my
post, so I don't know why you speak as if I am some kind of ozco
acolyte. It seems worthwhile pointing out the merits of the system as
well as its demerits, in a context where someone is claiming
government funding is an unmitigated evil for the arts.

Seed money for what? Even the fellowships aren't that much - 40 grand
a year (taxed) for two years? (Not much really if you're raising a
family,  less than your average office wonk. Ok if you're just one
person. So maybe grants should only go to people with their tubes
tied?)  Most grants seem to be between 10 and 20 grand. Less than that
probably is almost not worth getting, in terms of making work...what
writers need more than anything is time. I agree with you on means
testing.

We do have private patronage - Myer being the most prominent. But it's
easy enough to find a lot of philanthropic organisations, just google.
 Btw, I think all artists should read the rightwing columnists. Not
all the time, because they make you feel a bit sick, but it's salutory
to know what they're saying. And there are in fact grant ghost
writers- there is a small industry of them.

I would concede that unions are no more nor less corrupt than company manag=
ement, since union power is not in fact spread out, but is in fact highly c=
oncentrated in the union leadership. More often than not the union members =
follow union leadership. In fact, one can look at political support as to w=
hether there is a difference between the members and the leadership, since =
union members vote in much higher percentages for Republican candidates tha=
n support from the unions (meaning, the leaders) would indicate, since the =
unions as a whole support Democrats almost exclusively. To the extent that =
either companies or unions have too much power over one or the other that t=
here is more or less corruption. It also tends to correlate quite well with=
 whether government supports one side or the other as to whether one side o=
r the other is more corrupt. =0A=0ANow, as for radios and T.V., what you ca=
ll government being corrupted by the market, I call a successful revolt aga=
inst an unjust law. =0A=0AAgain, you are accusing me of being something I a=
m not: a political anarchist. The laws the government creates are typically=
 just only when they reflect rules that have arisen naturally -- such as la=
ws against incest that reflect our natural aversion known as the Westermarc=
k Effect. Good laws are those that are clear, simple, and create the greate=
st complexity of behavior and thus the most complex social systems overall.=
 Work in game theory and cellular automata show that clear, simple rules ca=
n in fact create high complexity. The key is that the rules be good rules -=
- a good rule being one that maximizes complexity. The question should alwa=
ys be: is this regulation designed to create more complex, transparent beha=
vior? Or is it designed to transfer power from one group to another? Or is =
it designed to benefit one group or individual over another? The vast major=
ity of regulations are designed to achieve the last two, not the first one.=
 Laws that were
 designed to achieve the first one would not have to be as complicated, con=
voluted, and confusing as they currently (purposefully) are. =0A=0ACertainl=
y, murder, theft, and slavery, being areas where both parties do not freely=
 enter into the exchange (and break social bonds in such a way as to simpli=
fy society), should be illegal. None of them are in fact economic interacti=
ons (the opposite of an economic interaction is the use of force or fraud).=
 Prostitution and drugs, however, should be legal, as they are economic int=
eractions. And their being illegal causes far more social problems than if =
they were legal. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A____________________________=

What do we assume greatness looks like?

David Orr poses this question in the NYT book review, February 22. I'm late=
 getting to this article.=20

Ashberry is the first poet to have a Library of America edition of his work=
s published during his lifetime. After Ashberry and his generation, who/ & =
what/ is great??

Orr mentions Robert Lowell as the last obvious candidate, a poet ambitious =
enough to be considered great.=A0 I'd include Berryman and=A0 Merwin. Perha=
ps Roethke. Anyone else??

I believe it was someone on this list who was asking for examples of poetry
of the abject.

I cannot remember seeing Mina Loy listed with her great poems of derelicts,
the homeless, extremely poor, etc. The most obvious are "Der Blinde Junge,"
"Lady Laura in Bohemia," "On Third Avenue," "Idiot Child on a Fire-Escape,"
Chiffon Velours," & "Hot Cross Bum." "Ephemerid" is about an lower class
child in the Bowery, not homeless however. The woman in "An Aged Woman" is
not necessary impoverished by anything but age.

What about W.C. Williams' poetry of the poor, the raped, etc.? (Or his
stories like "A Night in June.") Or Sandburg's "Mag" etc.?

Rukeyser has great poems about industrial abuse of workers &c. And Lerner
(Tillie Olson) about the abuse of Mexican workers &c. Much proletarian
poetry. Even _United States_ by Reznikoff.

I'm excited to announce that my new book, *Survey Says!,* is now available
for purchase at Black Maze Books <http://www.blackmazebooks.com/cat.html>.
*Survey Says!* is a procedural poem that arranges all of the answers,
correct and incorrect, from two months' worth of *Family Feud* episodes.

Excerpts are available here <http://tinyurl.com/bsu7vn> and
here<http://tinyurl.com/cbj7nq>
.


*Noctis Licentia* by Amy Lawless is also available from Black Maze Books.
"In *Noctis Licentia* Amy Lawless has thrown open the gates of a fascinating
menagerie.  As the liberated herd rushes by, readers will spot Rochester's
monkey and Marianne Moore's exotica, not to mention their own refelctions in
tiny or strange, prodigious creatures, but the pullulating mix -- the
audacious, bawdy, exuberant mix of humor and vitriol and sweet sympathy is
all Lawless."  -- Paul Violi

Much of the great monuments were in fact made with slave labor? Does that t=
hen argue for slave labor for other massive works? Yes, many of our great w=
orks of art were government-funded, and government funds come from somebody=
 with power having enough power to take money from weaker people. To me, th=
at argues against that method, no matter how successful it has been in the =
past. It's not magical thinking to believe there better, non-coercive ways =
to fund the arts, and that we should try to use and develop those. The mark=
et is one way. Nonprofit organizations such as mine are and can be another.=
 Both are highly preferable to the coercive methods of government. =0A=0AAn=
d fascism is indeed a form of socialism -- even if it is corporate socialis=
m. I'm sorry that's an inconvenient fact for everyone here. There are diffe=
rent kinds of socialism, you know -- it doesn't have to be communist in nat=
ure. Here is what Hitler's version looked like: he suspended the gold stand=
ard, embarked on huge public works programs like Autobahns, protected indus=
try from foreign competition, expanded credit, instituted jobs programs, bu=
llied the private sector on prices and production decisions, vastly expande=
d the military, enforced capital controls, instituted family planning, pena=
lized smoking, brought about national health care and unemployment insuranc=
e, imposed education standards, and eventually ran huge deficits. In all ho=
nesty, it was the kind of economy our government has been actively trying t=
o set up for a while now, though it's been accelerating quite a bit of late=
..=0A=0AThose who support government funding of the arts naively think that =
they will always have their people in charge and that therefore they will b=
e the ones getting the funding. But you can't count on being in charge in a=
 democratic country -- or even in socialist utopian dictatorship. I prefer =
to keep the government out of the arts completely, so there is far less dan=
ger of coercion or censorship -- direct or indirect. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=

Unions ARE good and management IS bad!

"I've traveled round this country
 From shore to shining shore
It really made me wonder
The things I heard and saw.
I saw the weary farmer
Plowing sod and loam
l heard the auction hammer
A knocking down his home

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the farmer sweated for

l saw the seaman standing
Idly by the shore
l heard the bosses saying
Got no work for you no more

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the seaman sweated for

I saw the weary miner
Scrubbing coal dust from his back
I heard his children cryin
Got no coal to heat the shack

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the miner sweated for

I've seen my brothers working
Throughout this mighty land
l prayed we'd get together
And together make a stand

Then we'd own those banks of marble
With a guard at every door
And we'd share those vaults of silver
That we have sweated for"

Not the ones you've chosen, not for me at least. Not Lowell, either.

Charles Olson
Robert Duncan
Robert Creeley
Lorine Niedecker
Barbara Guest
Alice Notley
Jackson Mac Low
Beverly Dahlen

But I start on a list, and I know I'll leave someone out. Or several
someones. Let's just say the above, certainly, and some others.

Troy,=0A=0AThe market already drives more than one art form. As many people=
 have pointed out, the majority of the music industry is driven by the free=
 market at a global level. Is the music industry any more equitable than ot=
her government-funded arts? Well, as cris costa pointed out, the only thing=
 that is successful nowadays are "cheap products, made quickly, sold for a =
lot of money," an argument you completely disregarded in your response to h=
er.=0A=0AYou also fail to show how a "nonprofit organization such as yours"=
 would be a better way to fund the arts. Are you implying you have better t=
aste than government administrators and/or anyone else on this listserv? Do=
 I believe that "my" people would be in charge of a government art funding =
program? Certainly not. Even though Canada and France have much better fund=
ing programs than the United States, they still have their faults. Does tha=
t mean we should scrap them? Well, they have certainly contributed to Canad=
ian arts and poetry being more interesting than the majority of US arts.=0A=
=0AFinally, many of the programs you are listed had already been enacted be=
fore Hitler's rise to power. National health care had for example been impl=
emented by Bismarck in 1883 (I might be a year or so off) and unemployment =
compensation in 1927 at the national level. The L=E4ndern had their own pro=
grams before it was made a federal law.=0A=0Afran=E7ois luong=0A=0A=0A=0A=

:42:35 PM=0ASubject: Re: Gift Economy=0A=0AMuch of the great monuments were=
 in fact made with slave labor? Does that then argue for slave labor for ot=
her massive works? Yes, many of our great works of art were government-fund=
ed, and government funds come from somebody with power having enough power =
to take money from weaker people. To me, that argues against that method, n=
o matter how successful it has been in the past. It's not magical thinking =
to believe there better, non-coercive ways to fund the arts, and that we sh=
ould try to use and develop those. The market is one way. Nonprofit organiz=
ations such as mine are and can be another. Both are highly preferable to t=
he coercive methods of government. =0A=0AAnd fascism is indeed a form of so=
cialism -- even if it is corporate socialism. I'm sorry that's an inconveni=
ent fact for everyone here. There are different kinds of socialism, you kno=
w -- it doesn't have to be communist in nature. Here is what Hitler's versi=
on looked like: he suspended the gold standard, embarked on huge public wor=
ks programs like Autobahns, protected industry from foreign competition, ex=
panded credit, instituted jobs programs, bullied the private sector on pric=
es and production decisions, vastly expanded the military, enforced capital=
 controls, instituted family planning, penalized smoking, brought about nat=
ional health care and unemployment insurance, imposed education standards, =
and eventually ran huge deficits. In all honesty, it was the kind of econom=
y our government has been actively trying to set up for a while now, though=
 it's been accelerating quite a bit of late..=0A=0AThose who support govern=
ment funding of the arts naively think that they will always have their peo=
ple in charge and that therefore they will be the ones getting the funding.=
 But you can't count on being in charge in a democratic country -- or even =
in socialist utopian dictatorship. I prefer to keep the government out of t=
he arts completely, so there is far less danger of coercion or censorship -=
- direct or indirect. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A_______________________=

i thought i'd mention that the canada council (canada's national arts
funding org) is apparently putting together a program to fund digital
writing by 2010. that's good news to me and the rest of us in canada doing
such work. i'm not sure if this had much to do with the decision, but
http://vispo.com/writings/misc/DigitalWritingProposalNoE.pdf is a petition i
wrote with michel lefebvre (montréal), lionel kearns (vancouver), and chris
joseph (montréal/london) in 2006. it's a petition for the canada council to
fund digital writing. the version of this doc we sent the canada council had
a few more sections to it. i've deleted confidential stuff (for instance,
the email addresses of the signatorees have been deleted). in any case, i
hope the doc might be of use to people in other countries hoping to get the
gov or other orgs to fund digital writing of some sort.

Did any of those people on your (charles) list graduate from Iowa?

Smartassery aside, your list is sort of like one I'd construct. And
different groups have different greats. I know a lot of people would
say Zukofsky. But that'd be a a helluva a thick book.

Doesn't this also at some point mark the passing of the author into
an even deader death? I'm thinking of Webster's Bunker Hill speech.
Once you're in that monument, you're so dead that they can use your
dusty bones to justify any stupid Mexican War they want. Or am I now
just spouting some version of "I used listen to them back before they
sold out"?

Does Williams already have one of these bible-paper tomes? Or do we
have to be content with the less Authoritative New Directions double-
volume set?

H.D. sure would be nice. I guess she'd need a couple of volumes, a la
Stein's 2.5 inches of shelf-space.

He's not a merkin, but I'd like to see something nicer than the pulpy
paper thing that houses the Robert Browning on my shelf.

Niedecker's got some nice editions out now. And some good attention
coming her way too. Creeley also has been feeling no shortage of the
hardback loving. (The publication-as-remembrance, a last chance to
keep his memory and ourselves warm?)

Where's that HD Book? The bootleg is all very well, but how about
something I can hold. The e-text kindles no warmth.

I'm rambling and procrastinating. There's a huge pile of papers to
grade. So I'll close with, come on, how about some H.D.!!

I've blogged some about this, because it really makes me mad. Orr's article
is preposterous. His claim, that there won't be another great poet because
there hasn't been a candidate yet, is as absurd as saying we won't cure AIDS
because we haven't yet.

If you asked anyone to name 10 greats from any contemporary category (film,
fiction, music, etc) it would be difficult. The fact that we're living it
almost excludes greatness from entering the equation. Is greatness, then, a
time issue? What I don't mean here is that "you become greater the longer
dead you are," but rather, it's difficult to even identify what is "great"
in an era in which those potential greats are working.

Live in the Limo  is a experimental temporary movable intimate white box.
Poets, artist and experimental musicians will be collaborating and
performing  live.
I will be Twittering a text of the sounds. Available live on my website-
www.art-poetry.info

Richard Kostelanetz will have the limo filled with some of his text pieces.
I will be performing Found Punctuation from Duchamp, Greenberg and others.
Only done twice before: Beyond Baroque and the Bowry. Poetry Club. All the
performances are both musical and as well as text and physical.


LIVE IN THE LIMO,

Champagne, Manhattan and Musical Stylists



The AC Institute's unmistakable white limousine will be hosted by 3 very
different musical and sound artist,  Sawako, Joseph F.  Di Ponio and
Benjamin Lanz, will collaborate and interact with other artists, poets
(Rainer Ganahl, Richard Kostelanetz, Elizabeth Gower, Lee Wells, Holly
Crawford and .,   and you.  You're invited for a special moment in art in
our moveable white box salon and experimental space   as it provides a
temporary residence to an eclectic range of performers.  Previous projects
in this series: "Critical Conversations in a Limo," "Sound Art Limo" and
"Flatland Limo."  Champagne, Manhattan  and musical stylists  are on the
menu.



"Live in the Limo", will run from 3-6pm on March 6th, 7th, and 8th, making

Tokyo/Brooklyn-based Sawako, a sound sculptor, a composer/improviser, a
timeline-based artist, and a signal alchemist, who will perform an
improvised work drawing on the specificities of this peculiar, yet familiar
space in motion; New York City-based composer Joseph F. Di Ponio who, in
creating interactive pieces, will investigate the properties of this
sonic/sounding body;  and trombonist/multi-instrumentalist Benjamin Lanz who
will be a one-man show-though not one-dimensional, performing a wide variety
of multimedia contemporary works, commissions, and improvisations.



This event is free. However, space is very limited.  The AC Institute is a

I try to avoid posting to the list these days=2C but I have to speak up her=
e in agreement with Charles.  Though I'll grant that Roethke can be interes=
ting=2C and I don't have any serious disagreements with anybody on Charles'=
s list=2C my own would look more like:

Louis Zukofsky
George Oppen
Niedecker
Mac Low
Creeley
Jack Spicer
Frank O'Hara
John Ashbery (sp.)
Barbara Guest
Ted Berrigan
Alice Notley
Bernadette Mayer
Anne Waldman
Clark Coolidge

But again=2C when we make these lists=2C we're leaving so many people out.

The real question behind all these lists are twofold:

1. How is "greatness" defined?  Can it be defined?  And since the answer to=
 that is=2C I think=2C that it can't (and no=2C a Library of America additi=
on has nothing whatso-fucking-ever to do with it)...
2. Whose values do these lists represent?

The second question may be the more interesting.  For instance I notice tha=
t there are no women in Steve's list=2C although there is no shortage of wo=
men in the more aesthetically conservative end of the poetry spectrum which=
 he apparently prefers.  Plath or Rich=2C for example=2C I would take over =
Lowell any day.  By the same token=2C though Charles and I both have women =
and gay men in our lists=2C none of us (and I very much include myself in t=
his) have poets of color/non-caucasians.  It strikes me that equally intere=
sting lists could be assembled which would include the likes of Langston Hu=
ghes=2C Baraka=2C Melvin Tolson=2C Nathaniel Mackey (or=2C if you prefer=2C=
 Gwendolyn Brooks=2C Alice Walker=2C etc.).

But who gets to decide which list is the "right" one?

Hi Alison

No need to feel sorry, I like the sucky suck of eggs, been doing it so long.

Alas, I can't share your 'fascination' with arts funding - although it
IS fascinating for those few moments when you get the letter saying
you got a grant.

>Seed money for what? Even the fellowships aren't that much - 40 grand

Seed money for the power bill for a few months while you write some
poems and don't worry about the power bills ?
Sounds okay to me.

Wow, I was a 'wonker' for years and years and didn't actually  earn
that $40,000 per annum.
And that fellowship (which seems to go to only 3 Australian prize
winners each year, including, I should say, a couple of friends of
mine who landed one) is now $50,000 a year for two years

I can think of 5 poets who could use $10, 000
10 poets who could use $5000
etcetera

TAX - yep - all govt grants  should be tax-free - we already invested
in them via our jobs.

I usually think of grants as 'back-pay' for years of unpaid cultural labour
except for once once, way way back when I was young I got a small
teensy OzCo grant that was definitely 'seed money'
It was great - 1976 ! here's to it!  Thirteen more books later.


>We do have private patronage - Myer being the most prominent. But it's
>easy enough to find a lot of philanthropic organisations, just google.

Don't care enough to google, not looking. But,of course,  you know,
hooray for the philanthropic - tax deductible no less.

>Btw, I think all artists should read the rightwing columnists. Not

I've been fraudulent with you - I have read Andrew Bolt !
(I was trying to stay undercover)

There I've been innocent, naive, eggless even. I didn't know.

Thanks for thinking about it all Alison,


Pam

Mark, I would certainly have had Zukofsky, Oppen, on my list -- but I =20=

thought it was supposed to be "post-Ashbery." I put Niedecker on =20
because she didn't emerge to most readers until post-Ashbery. But I =20

that includes all of your suggestions, plus Simon Ortiz, Mei-mei =20
Berssenbrugge, and, I am sure, quite a few more. When I have made =20
lists for students of "who they should read," the names go on & on & =20
on, for a couple of pages or so.

But as you say, is there a "right" list? Does there need to be one?

Your example of the Na of China only proves the point of the Westermarck Ef=

I do believe I can make better judgments than any government administrator,=
 yes. Especially if they are working in their capacity of government admini=
strator. Impersonal judgment is no judgment. As for people on the listserv,=
 I believe my judgment is better than some, the same as others, and likely =
worse than a few -- but we are free to have those differences, that those w=
ho agree that my judgments are better or the same as theirs can support my =
nonprofit, and those who disagree can contribute to one (or start their own=
) that better reflects their own taste. The point is that such actions woul=
d be voluntary.=0A=0APersonally, I've seen no evidence that France or Canad=
a is turning out superior artists, though I have n o doubt that the French =
and the French Canadians certainly think so. I will admit, though, that our=
 art and literature will improve greatly the minute we stop being influence=
d by the French theorists. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A__________________=

As many people=0ATroy,=0A=0AThe market already drives more than one art for=
m. As many people have pointed out, the majority of the music industry is d=
riven by the free market at a global level. Is the music industry any more =
equitable than other government-funded arts? Well, as cris costa pointed ou=
t, the only thing that is successful nowadays are "cheap products, made qui=
ckly, sold for a lot of money," an argument you completely disregarded in y=
our response to her.=0A=0AYou also fail to show how a "nonprofit organizati=
on such as yours" would be a better way to fund the arts. Are you implying =
you have better taste than government administrators and/or anyone else on =
this listserv? Do I believe that "my" people would be in charge of a govern=
ment art funding program? Certainly not. Even though Canada and France have=
 much better funding programs than the United States, they still have their=
 faults. Does that mean we should scrap them? Well, they have certainly con=
tributed to Canadian arts and poetry being more interesting than the majori=
ty of US arts.=0A=0AFinally, many of the programs you are listed had alread=
y been enacted before Hitler's rise to power. National health care had for =
example been implemented by Bismarck in 1883 (I might be a year or so off) =
and unemployment compensation in 1927 at the national level. The L=E4ndern =
had their own programs before it was made a federal law.=0A=0Afran=E7ois lu=

March 4, 2009 1:42:35 PM=0ASubject: Re: Gift Economy=0A=0AMuch of the great=
 monuments were in fact made with slave labor? Does that then argue for sla=
ve labor for other massive works? Yes, many of our great works of art were =
government-funded, and government funds come from somebody with power havin=
g enough power to take money from weaker people. To me, that argues against=
 that method, no matter how successful it has been in the past. It's not ma=
gical thinking to believe there better, non-coercive ways to fund the arts,=
 and that we should try to use and develop those. The market is one way. No=
nprofit organizations such as mine are and can be another. Both are highly =
preferable to the coercive methods of government. =0A=0AAnd fascism is inde=
ed a form of socialism -- even if it is corporate socialism. I'm sorry that=
's an inconvenient fact for everyone here. There are different kinds of soc=
ialism, you know -- it doesn't have to be communist in nature. Here is what=
 Hitler's version looked like: he suspended the gold standard, embarked on =
huge public works programs like Autobahns, protected industry from foreign =
competition, expanded credit, instituted jobs programs, bullied the private=
 sector on prices and production decisions, vastly expanded the military, e=
nforced capital controls, instituted family planning, penalized smoking, br=
ought about national health care and unemployment insurance, imposed educat=
ion standards, and eventually ran huge deficits. In all honesty, it was the=
 kind of economy our government has been actively trying to set up for a wh=
ile now, though it's been accelerating quite a bit of late..=0A=0AThose who=
 support government funding of the arts naively think that they will always=
 have their people in charge and that therefore they will be the ones getti=
ng the funding. But you can't count on being in charge in a democratic coun=
try -- or even in socialist utopian dictatorship. I prefer to keep the gove=
rnment out of the arts completely, so there is far less danger of coercion =
or censorship -- direct or indirect. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A________=

 There is no account for naturally occurring taste, especially in a free ma=

idence for this assertion, much like there is no evidence for the free mark=

nded art goes back all the way to the Antiquity. Who funded the Parthenon, =
for example? Or Leonardo receiving his funding from Francis I of France? An=
 example of an artistic situation within a free market context? Try Germany=
 in the 1930s (just because the Nazi have "Socialist" in their name does no=
t make them socialists. Being in the pocket of Mercedes and Krupp proves it=
), with the painters of the Neue Sachlichkeit being persecuted because thei=

the article opened an old Elizabeth Bishop wound, mentioning her as Lowell's more talented, though less ambitious contemporary. Bishop, skilled, but not terribly interesting. What does she write about? What does she write about that's of any interest to, ugh, most readers?  Btw, I prefer a list that includes Duncan, Creeley and Guest to the few mainstream (not terribly interesting) names I brought up.

Mathmaticians may  have more candidates (Greatness) than poets: no such thing as a postmodern proof.

Dear friends,

Just a quick reminder that the incredible Lisa Robertson will read at =20=

Moe's Books on Saturday, March 7, with Rae Armantrout, and it should =20
be a stellar reading from two acclaimed and innovative writers.

Lisa Robertson will launch her brand-new book, Lisa Robertson's =20
Magenta Soul Whip (Coach House Books). Composed of previously =20
uncollected verses, essays, confessions, reports, translations, =20
drafts, treatises, laments and utopias from the past fifteen years, =20
Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul Whip presents a window into the workings =
=20
of what The Village Voice calls the =91seductive intellect=92 of one of =20=

today=92s most diverse and daring authors.

Robertson will read fat historic Moe=92s Books with influential West =20
Coast poet Rae Armantrout, who will read from Versed (Wesleyan Press).


Lisa Robertson and Rae Armantrout at Moe's
Saturday, March 7, 7:30 pm
Moe=92s Books, 2476 Telegraph Avenue
Berkeley, CA

Thanks! We hope to see you there this Saturday!

***
About Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul Whip:

Lisa Robertson writes poems that mine the past =96 its ideas, its =20
personages, its syntax =96 to construct a lexicon of the future. Her =20
poems both court and cuckold subjectivity by unmasking its fundament =20
of sex and hesitancy, the coil of doubt in its certitude. Reading her =20=

laments and utopias, we realize that language =96 whiplike =96 casts =
ahead =20
of itself a fortuitous form. The form brims here pleasurably with =20
dogs, movie stars, broths, painting=92s detritus, Latin and pillage. =20
Erudite and startling, the poems in Lisa Robertson=92s Magenta Soul =20
Whip, occasional works written over the past fifteen years collected =20
by Elisa Sampedrin, turn vestige into architecture, chagrin into =20
resplendence. In them, we recognize our grand, saddened century.

Praise for Lisa Robertson:

=91For [Robertson] all things provoke acts of attention, and hospitable =20=

ones at that: sentences play around and about, on sidewalks or =20
ladders, in gardens and sheds, through strawberry patches, over and =20
under tentative city plans with which to relineate our own lives.=92 =96 =
=20
The Believer

Canadian poet and essayist Lisa Robertson is currently artist-in-=20
residence at California College of the Arts. Her books include =20
XEclogue, Debbie: An Epic, The Men, The Weather and Occasional Works =20
and Seven Walks from the Office for Soft Architecture. A frequent =20
collaborator across genres and media, she is currently making a video =20=

with the Vancouver artist Allyson Clay and Nathalie Stephens and =20
constructing new works in digital sound with poet Stacy Doris.

David Orr in the NY Times incorrectly cited Ashbery as the first living aut=
hor to be published in the Library of America series. And Orr was perhaps, =
in knee-jerk fashion, repeating (he should have known  better) an arts-in-b=
rief entry of some weeks earlier in the Times that said the same thing. Bel=
ow is a letter I wrote in response to the Orr article. Samuel Menashe was t=
he first living poet to be published by the Library of America, and Orr act=
ually reviewed the book! Oh well.

Here's the letter:


22 February 2009

The Editor
The New York Times Book Review
letters@nytimes.com<mailto:letters@nytimes.com>

Dear Editor,

With all due respect to David Orr, whose articles I always enjoy, his On Po=
etry piece ("The Greatness[ness] Game") in today's Book Review begins incor=
rectly and I would say unfairly; he writes that "John Ashbery became the fi=
rst poet to have an edition of his works released by the Library of America=
 in his own lifetime." That honor actually belongs to Samuel Menashe, who w=
as the first recipient of the Poetry Foundation's prestigious Neglected Mas=
ters Award and consequently whose book, New and Selected Poems, was publish=
ed by the Library of America in 2005. Menashe is still very much alive.

I find it remarkable that Mr. Orr wrote an article in your pages ("A 'Negle=
cted' Master," 19 March 2006) about Menashe's award and subsequent publicat=
ion. Ashbery has been showered with a great many accolades, well deserved, =
and thus the irony of the echo chamber Mr. Orr and perhaps others at the Ne=
w York Times seem to be trapped in. Menashe has been recognized, has been h=
onored, but he certainly deserves wider recognition; his poetry should be r=
ead by more people who I suppose depend on publications like the Book Revie=
w to acquaint them with what's worth their time to read.

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Burt Kimmelman, Professor of English and Chair

Wow, I might be overwhelmed if I knew what you=20
were getting at. I guess the point is that almost=20
all societies do certain things. There's a bias=20
here that's I think more essential than whatever=20
you're trying to demonstrate (natural law,=20
maybe?), towards noticing, or extracting,=20
universals, rather than noticing difference. Most=20
of your catalogue involves survival needs, and=20
one could say that most societies most of the=20
time are interested in surviving. A given, but=20
not a very high order of commonality. How those=20
needs are expressed are so wildly various that=20
they're often unrecognizable as part of the same categories.

 From this generalizing tendency come Jung,=20
Campbell, and Eliade, all, interestingly,=20
fellow-travelers of the nazis (actually, Eliade=20
was considerably more). At the core of their=20
fanciful constructions (I mean, Campbell, at what=20
useful level of generalization does every=20
depiction of a mother and child mean the same=20
thing?) is a profound understanding of human=20
needs, which could be summarized as "man gotta eat, man gotta fuck."

You might try reading more widely in anthropology.

As to incest. 1. other animals also display an=20
incest taboo, though often expressed differently.=20
2. unless there's a recessive gene in common=20
mating between parents and children or sibs=20
carries no genetic danger for the offspring. 3.=20
cousin marriage, which in most places is neither=20
taboo nor illegal, also limits the gene=20

European royalty. So the incest taboo is only=20
very weakly tied to genetics. But in most=20
societies incest distorts family structure in=20
unacceptable ways, and the taboo is structured to=20
avoid that distortion. Westermarck rather proves=20
the point--he's not describing an aversion to=20

Enough of this. Reductions of human complexity tend to make me itch all=
 over.

This is a good start, though I'd certainly have WCW on the list. Question:

Am facilitating a six week course and would love to have examples from these poets (or other NAP or Neo-Baroque, or other experimental poets) regarding powerful IMAGERY. Any takers?

The point of the list is that it shows there are in fact universals. Yes, t=
hey do get expressed in different ways, but in our obsession with differenc=
e, we too often forget that there are also unities. There is unity in varie=
ty, and variety in unity. The one does not negate the other. Think about th=
e universal or "religion" -- does that restrict variety? If the number of r=
eligions and their expressions throughout human history is any indication, =
hardly. In fact, it has create a wider variety of behaviors in humans than =
exist in nonreligious primates like chimpanzees. In your fear of generalizi=
ng, don't throw out the baby with the bath water. And don't think that univ=
ersals means lack of variety. It in fact means quite the contrary, if you u=
nderstand the unity-variety aspect of behavior.=0A=0AI'm of the opinion tha=
t more anthropologists need to know more about their own cultures and about=
 other cultures. That ignorance has been a driving force in their claims of=
 un-unified variety.=0A=0AYou are correct that the Westermarck Effect does =
in fact prevent attempts at breeding between "close playmates," if you will=
.. That doesn't disprove anything, though. A generalized tendency in this re=
spect make more sense than something far more complex that results in highe=
r accuracy. In fact, in more primitive situations, the correlation between =
playmate and close relative was so high as to be essentially the same, mean=
ing the evolution of the Westermarck Effect as it is made perfect sense. I'=
m not entirely sure what you're objecting to. Since the correlation between=
 close playmates and close relatives was essentially identical in our evolu=
tionary past, go with the easier tendency. Again, this gets translated up i=
nto cultural and then legal incest prohibitions. The addition of cousins is=
 in fact a more recent cultural innovation in only a few cultures, where it=
 has become understood in a more abstract level what being "related" really=
 means, in a larger
 genetic sense.=0A=0AThis isn't about reductions of human complexity, but o=
f understanding humans in their full complexity. Positing that we have insu=
rmountable differences is both false and a barrier to understanding each ot=
her as human beings. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A________________________=

ricky even if you were more careful. Case in point: the Westermarck Effect.=
 Westermarck observed, and subsequent research has confirmed, that children=
 who live together until age 6 are unlikely to be sexually attracted to eac=
h other, even if they're not biologically-related. Siblings raised apart
 until age 6 exhibit no such "natural" inhibition. And sibling incest remai=
ns more common than parent-child incest. The inhibition appears to be fairl=
y weak. All societies we know of have definitions of incest and rules forbi=
dding it. The rules vary, as do ideas about who one's relatives are. Among =
the Na, an ethnic minority in China, for instance, families are defined as =
offspring of the same mother, and siblings live together and raise any chil=
dren communally, the brothers acting as father. There's in theory no sex wi=
thin the home or the sibling group. Otherwise, men and women are free to sl=
eep with whoever, and do so enthusiastically and without stricture. Since n=
obody knows who their father is a lot of incest in our terms happens. It's =
simply not an issue for the Na. (See  Clifford Geertz, "The Visit," his rev=
iew of Cai Hua, _A Society Without Fathers: The Na of China (Zone Books, 20=
01), in NYRB Volume 48, Number 16 =B7 October 18, 2001.) The point

It should be pointed out that the Menashe volume is in a different series
than the Ashbery volume. Menashe is in the "American Poets Project"
published by the Library of America. The Ashbery volume is part of the

Troy,

"our art and literature will improve greatly the minute we stop being
influenced by the French theorists."

Why does almost every statement you make must involve the putting down of
another? Are you aware how ridiculous that statements sounds. How much of
American literature, do you thing, is influenced by "French theorists"? Or
how much of French literature is influence by "French theorists" for that
matter? What is a French theorist anyhow?

To indulge in some name calling myself, are you aware demonizing the other
is the basic mode of Fascist thought, regardless how much libertarian, you
might image, means liberty.

Ciao,

Murat

In keeping with the theme, "the languages of modernism," I would like to
propose two topics for either panels or roundtables. The first seems
obvious, "the role of translation with respect to English language prosodies
and experiments in language." The second, closer to my heart, "translating
the language of abjection." In either instance, my preference would be to
work with active translators.



Your suggestions are welcome.

Call for proposals for a panel submission to the Association for the
Study of the Arts of the Present, first annual conference.

Poetics of Presence

This panel interrogates ways of making present what is temporally,
spatially, and/or ontologically absent. While many contemporary "poetics
of presence" have sought to radicalize Modernist critiques of the
metaphysics of presence--especially by the deployment of deconstructive
theories within cultural studies frameworks--utopian spiritual and
political projects have been relegated to categories of benign nostalgia
or oppressive, uncritical insurgence. This panel seeks fluencies between
these two modes of working with and without the present: the other as
the "same" as a poetics of presence deferred/differentiated from itself,
another poetics it hails, calls to, invokes, etc. Proposals for
presentations of work (including performance) or scholarship are
welcomed from critics, philosophers, and artists of any medium.

Please send one page abstract with short bio to Patrick F. Durgin:
kenningeditions@gmail.com by Sat. March 21st.

I'm hoping someone can help.

I am helping a friend look for an Israeli printer/publisher to print
a booklet of an American poem (3 pages long in the original) which
has been translated into Hebrew and Arabic. The poem will be
published in the United States by a small press  ( there will be
three separate editions of the poem, which will appear in English,
Hebrew, and Arabic. An American publisher has been found, and my
friend is trying to find Arabic and Hebrew publishers, as well. This
will be three editions of the same poem in three languages (the
booklet will most likely cover 9 pages)--one distributed by an
american press, one by an Arab press, one by an israeli press. Any
ideas? He is NOT looking to print an expensive, rare edition.

Any lead or information is welcome. You can backchannel to me at

GINSBERG'S KARMA. A documentary about the legendary poet Allen Ginsberg and
his mythical journey to India in the early 1960s that transformed his
perspective on life and his work. Ginsberg traveled to India with Peter
Orlovsky, to escape the media pressure of being an icon of the "Beat
Generation" and to recover from writer's block after writing several of the
most important poems of the 20th Century, including Howl. He hoped to
re-create the hallucinatory "William Blake" vision that inspired his earlier
work and search for a new muse other than drugs. Poet Bob Holman traces the
two years Ginsberg spent in India by visiting the places where he stayed and
talking with the people Ginsberg met and influenced.  Also included in the
documentary are intimate interviews with Beat poets Gary Snyder, Joanne
Kyger, Anne Waldman, John Giorno and others. The film is inspired by
Ginsberg's collection, Indian Journals, and Deborah Baker's book, A Blue
Hand: The Beats in India. By discovering Ginsberg's experiences in India,
Bob Holman traces how Ginsberg effected the counter-culture movement of the
1960s and Buddhism in America.

Dear New York friends,

An incredible literary event is happening at the CUNY Graduate Center
late this March:

LISA ROBERTSON and SINA QUEYRAS - MARCH 20

On Friday, March 20th, the City University of New York's Graduate
Center presents two acclaimed Canadian poets who have both done
remarkable things with the lyric essay form. Coach House Books, one of
Canada's most noted avant-garde presses, has recently published the
new collections Lisa Robertson's Magenta Soul Whip by Lisa Robertson
and Expressway by Sina Queyras. Robertson and Queyras will read from
these brand-new works and participate in a discussion.


Lisa Robertson -- Governor General's Award nominee, author of The
Weather and The Men and frequent cross-genre collaborator -- visits
from San Francisco to launch Lisa Robertson's Magenta Soul Whip, a new
book of previously uncollected poems essays, drafts, reports,
treatises and laments. Toronto's Eye Weekly calls it an 'exuberant,
saucy approach to the materiality of language and vice versa.'

Sina Queyras -- Lambda Literary Award winner, former co-curator of the
Belladonna series and noted literary blogger (lemonhound.blogspot.com)
-- visits from Montreal to launch Expressway, her new collection that
uses the modes of the Romantic poets to explore the world of modern
transportation and mobility. Check out the trailer for Expressway at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui9Qw_RtWRk


Lisa Robertson and Sina Queyras in New York City
launching Lisa Robertson's Magenta Soul Whip and Expressway
Friday, March 20
CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York
Room 9204
6:00 p.m.

I'm sorry that I don't uncritically accept every idea that comes along. Hol=
d, it, wait, neither do you. You just like what I don't, and dislike what I=
 do. That doesn't make me a fascist. In fact, you show you don't even know =
what a fascist is, with this statement. =0A=0AThe American postmodernist wr=
iters were all influenced by such people as Sartre, deBeauvoir, Lacan, Derr=
ida, Barthes, Foucauld, etc. I've read them all. I like them all. But they =
have had too much influence over American letters over the last half centur=
y, and it will benefit us greatly to come out from under that influence pre=
cisely because of the fascist foundations of their ideas and works (see Wol=
in's works on the fascist foundations of the postmodernist thinkers in "Hei=
degger's Children" and "The Seduction of Unreason" and Argyros' "A Blessed =
Rage for Order" on Derrida). =0A=0AThe ability to judge ideas or their infl=
uence as bad doesn't make one a fascist. It shows that one is able to think=
 and make critical judgments based on observation. The attempt to stifle di=
alogue by throwing around the word "fascist" to label those with whom you d=
isagree is in fact a fascist tactic.=0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A_________=

So because Martin Heidegger was a Nazi the disenchanted Marxist ideas =20=

of existentialism and post-structuralism were founded in fascism? It =20
seems quite clear to me that you haven't read all of the "French =20
Theorists" you're talking about because you are lumping them together =20=

inappropriately as if they represent some monolith of ideology that =20
doesn't exist. Borrowing the following quote from the wikipedia entry =20=

on postmodernism, Judith Butler pointed out that:
"A number of positions are ascribed to postmodernism - Discourse is =20
all there is, as if discourse were some kind of monistic stuff out of =20=

which all things are composed; the subject is dead, I can never say =20
=93I=94 again; there is no reality, only representation. These =20
characterizations are variously imputed to postmodernism or =20
poststructuralism, which are conflated with each other and sometimes =20
conflated with deconstruction, and understood as an indiscriminate =20
assemblage of French feminism, deconstruction, Lacanian =20
psychoanalysis, Foucauldian analysis, Rorty=92s conversationalism, and =20=

cultural studies ... In reality, these movements are opposed: =20
Lacanian psychoanalysis in France positions itself officially against =20=

poststructuralism, that Foucauldian rarely relate to Derridideans ... =20=

Lyotard champions the term, but he cannot be made into the example of =20=

what all the rest of the purported postmodernists are doing. =20
Lyotard=92s work is, for instance, seriously at odds with that of =
Derrida"

more importantly, looking around at the literary field of the last 40 =20=

years or so I see in prose generally a marginal group in the vein of =20
Gaddis/Pynchon/Barth/Coover/Delillo/Wallace et al that is rapidly =20
giving way to the sort of thing that Michael Chabon is now up to =20
where the wild craziness of the high postmodernists is replaced with =20
a more subtle emphasis on traditional storytelling and the =20
artificiality of the publishing market controlled "genres" of =20
fiction. In poetry the situation is much clearer, where there were =20
poets influenced by philosophers, the most obvious being the Language =20=

poets, many of them are much more involved in anglo-american =20
philosophy than you are giving them credit. Wittgenstein is an =20
obvious influence across the board, but probably more important are =20
John Cage, Gertrude Stein, and Charles Olson, none of whom were =20
formed in the grips of anything you might find in the Saussure to =20
Derrida tradition in philosphy you're pointing at. Ted Berrigan was =20
heavily inspired by Whitehead, and Bertrand Russeell is the most =20
widely read philosopher that I'm aware of for those poets who read =20
philosophy.

All of that aside, by my lights, it still seems to me that =20
contemporary poetry is largely dominated by slam poetry and the sort =20
of MOR confessionalism that you find in Seamus Heaney, Billy Collins, =20=

and their ilk. ANd frankly the complaints of the reactionary trend to =20=

be found in neo-formalism are much more present in the popular =20
consciousness than anything informed by Barthes or other critics with =20=

his commitments.

So really, while there is a great deal of nattering by undergraduates =20=

about poorly understood french philosophers leaking out of cultural =20
studies departments, i just don't see all this influence that you're =20
talking about by "French Theorists" and it makes me wonder what it is =20=

that you're reading, because it's not the same stuff I am.

So because Martin Heidegger was a Nazi the disenchanted Marxist ideas =20
of existentialism and post-structuralism were founded in fascism? It =20
seems quite clear to me that you haven't read all of the "French =20
Theorists" you're talking about because you are lumping them together =20
inappropriately as if they represent some monolith of ideology that =20
doesn't exist. Borrowing the following quote from the wikipedia entry =20
on postmodernism, Judith Butler pointed out that:
"A number of positions are ascribed to postmodernism - Discourse is =20
all there is, as if discourse were some kind of monistic stuff out of =20
which all things are composed; the subject is dead, I can never say =20
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D again; there is no reality, only representation. These =
=20
characterizations are variously imputed to postmodernism or =20
poststructuralism, which are conflated with each other and sometimes =20
conflated with deconstruction, and understood as an indiscriminate =20
assemblage of French feminism, deconstruction, Lacanian =20
psychoanalysis, Foucauldian analysis, Rorty=E2=80=99s conversationalism, an=
d =20
cultural studies ... In reality, these movements are opposed: =20
Lacanian psychoanalysis in France positions itself officially against =20
poststructuralism, that Foucauldian rarely relate to Derridideans ... =20
Lyotard champions the term, but he cannot be made into the example of =20
what all the rest of the purported postmodernists are doing. =20
Lyotard=E2=80=99s work is, for instance, seriously at odds with that of Der=
rida"

more importantly, looking around at the literary field of the last 40 =20
years or so I see in prose generally a marginal group in the vein of =20
Gaddis/Pynchon/Barth/Coover/Delillo/Wallace et al that is rapidly =20
giving way to the sort of thing that Michael Chabon is now up to =20
where the wild craziness of the high postmodernists is replaced with =20
a more subtle emphasis on traditional storytelling and the =20
artificiality of the publishing market controlled "genres" of =20
fiction. In poetry the situation is much clearer, where there were =20
poets influenced by philosophers, the most obvious being the Language =20
poets, many of them are much more involved in anglo-american =20
philosophy than you are giving them credit. Wittgenstein is an =20
obvious influence across the board, but probably more important are =20
John Cage, Gertrude Stein, and Charles Olson, none of whom were =20
formed in the grips of anything you might find in the Saussure to =20
Derrida tradition in philosophy you're pointing at. Ted Berrigan was =20
heavily inspired by Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell is the most =20
widely read philosopher that I'm aware of for those poets who read =20
philosophy.

All of that aside, by my lights, it still seems to me that =20
contemporary poetry is largely dominated by slam poetry and the sort =20
of MOR confessionalism that you find in Seamus Heaney, Billy Collins, =20
and their ilk. ANd frankly the complaints of the reactionary trend to =20
be found in neo-formalism are much more present in the popular =20
consciousness than anything informed by Barthes or other critics with =20
his commitments.

So really, while there is a great deal of nattering by undergraduates =20
about poorly understood french philosophers leaking out of cultural =20
studies departments, i just don't see all this influence that you're =20
talking about by "French Theorists" and it makes me wonder what it is =20
that you're reading, because it's not the same stuff I am.

I think the problem isn't that Troy misunderstands "french theory" in this=
 way, but rather
that the vast majority of poets and academics writing and talking today th=
us
misunderstand "french theory". In my conversations, here as elsewhere, it'=
s pretty
clear that we're all postmodernists now, even those of us who don't want t=
o be,
because if you can't talk or write in that misunderstood "french theory" w=
ay you can't
get good jobs, grants, publications, or even invited to the right parties.=
 The vague
misunderstanding of "french theory", that amalgamation you and Butler are =
pointing
out, is the common basis of arts discussion, now.

Few people are interested in reading the original writers, or discussing t=
heir actual
ideas any more than the people who happily cheat on their spouses on the b=
asis of the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (don't ask unless you really want to know=
!) really
want to understand that principle. Misunderstanding, a vague awareness of =
the terms
based on some coffee-shop or bar discussions and having read a few reviews=
, busy
lives applying for grants and jobs, attending their acquaintances' poetry =
readings, and
reading at their own, and driving all over hell and creation to substitute=
 teach a
remedial course that's labled "Creative Writing" for $875 a semester in or=
der to eke out
the car payment and some groceries -- good lord, it's no wonder these folk=
s have no
freaking idea which "french theory" they're laboring under a misapprehensi=
on of.

The wonder isn't that most poets don't understand "french theory" -- the w=
onder is they
even know it may be "french". Hmm. Maybe they don't!

Hi all,

I'm looking for a non-NYC press that we haven't hosted before to host =20=

the levy lives series event on Tues. July 28. Below's the formal =20
invite, please email me if you're interested:

editor@boogcity.com

best,
David

---------

Hi,

David Kirschenbaum here. I=92m the editor and publisher of Boog City, a =20=

New York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its =20
18th year. I=92d like to invite your press to take part in year six of =20=

our =93d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press=94 series.

The series is held at Chelsea=92s ACA Galleries (http://=20
acagalleries.com/), which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of =20
the poet Simon Perchik. It=92s a nice space, and we fit 100 people, =20
including a nine-piece jazz flash orchestra, in it for Chax Press=92s =20=

event, with plenty of room to spare. The gallery provides wine and =20
other beverages, and cheese and crackers and hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three =20
or more of their authors to read (we=92ve had as many as 10 for one =20
press and usually have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a =20
musical act perform two 15-20 minute sets. If the visiting press is =20
able to book the musical act that=92s preferred, so it=92s truly their =20=

night, if not I can book one that I think will work well with the =20
night. (Also, once a year we play host to our NYC brethren.)

The series is held on the last Tuesday of each month at 6:00 p.m. If =20
you=92re game to partake, I'd like you to host the final event of the =20=

season, Tues. July 28.

We started the series in August 2003. In our first six seasons we=92ve =20=

hosted (or are about to host):

(locations are at the time of the event)

Dear Chicago friends,

Celebrated Canadian poet, playwright, artist and arts writer, RM =20
Vaughan reads with multimedia artist Doug Ischar at Chicago's Red =20
Rover Series this Saturday, March 14.

RM Vaughan is a Toronto-based writer and video artist. His previous =20
books include the poetry collections A Selection of Dazzling Scarves, =20=

Invisible to Predators and Ruined Stars; the novels A Quilted Heart =20
and Spells; and the play collections Camera, Woman and The Monster =20
Trilogy. Vaughan writes about art and culture for numerous periodicals =20=

and currently pens a weekly celebrity-pestering column for the Globe =20
and Mail. Vaughan=92s videos are shown in galleries and festivals around =
=20
the world.

RM Vaughan's latest book is Troubled, a poetic account of the author's =20=

disastrous affair with his psychiatrist. With his signature mix of =20
scathing self-analysis and volatile wordplay, RM Vaughan brazenly =20
documents how an innocent flirtation with his therapist escalated into =20=

dangerous sexual misadventure. And when the clandestine relationship =20
goes awry, the consequences are heart-rending and career-ending. =20

Malahat Review among smaller periodicals facing loss of funding

OTTAWA -- A coalition of Canadian poetry journals, fiction magazines and
other literary publications with deep roots in the CanLit landscape is
decrying new federal rules that would exclude such small-circulation titles
as the University of Victoria-based Malahat Review and Matrix from crucial
access to funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage.

The new Canada Periodical Fund, announced last month by Heritage Minister
James Moore and still being designed by government officials, would deny
certain federal grants to most publications with annual sales of fewer than
5,000 copies.

"The government is improving the way it does business to meet the changing
needs of Canadians," Moore said when the program was announced in February.
"The way in which support to Canadian periodicals is delivered will be
reformed to maximize value for money and to seize opportunities in today's
global, technological environment."

But arts advocates say that while small publishers could still qualify for
some grants from the Canada Council for the Arts, the new funding
restrictions would cripple or kill a host of venerable titles that,
collectively, are seen as the seedbed of the country's literary imagination.

"The new formula would be a huge blow to the small number of literary
publishers that depend on Heritage to survive," Quill & Quire, the Canadian
books magazine, has warned.

John Barton, editor of Malahat Review -- a quarterly prose-and-poetry
magazine that sells about 4,000 copies annually -- said his 42-year-old
publication would lose about $20,000 a year under the new formula.

Barton is spearheading a Facebook-based campaign aimed at pressuring the
Conservative government -- which stumbled in its bid for a majority in last
fall's election after an arts-funding uproar in Quebec -- to scrap the
5,000-copy minimum for federal grants.

In an interview yesterday, Barton called the Malahat Review "an iconic
magazine in Canadian letters" and noted that it was the first literary
journal to publish Canadian author Yann Martel, winner of the international
Man Booker Prize in 2002 for his blockbuster novel The Life of Pi.

Among the writers published in the magazine's latest edition is John
Steffler, who recently ended his two-year term as parliamentary poet
laureate -- the federally appointed figurehead of Canadian literature.

The Barton-founded Coalition to Keep Canadian Heritage Support for Literary
and Arts Magazines argues that the current funding rules are a "slap in the
face" to literary publishers and to the many Canadian writers who "began
illustrious, international careers in these seminal if modest publications."

Barton said nearly 3,000 writers and readers have expressed support for the
coalition at its website in the past few weeks.

"There's a groundswell," he said.

A statement from Moore's office sent yesterday to Canwest News Service said
the 5,000-copy rule was implemented following extensive consultations and
analysis that showed "there were significant administrative costs to manage
extremely small amounts of funding for extremely small periodicals."

The statement added that "there will be exceptions to this 5,000-copy per
year rule in some very specific cases (such as weekly newspapers serving
official-language minority communities or Aboriginal communities)" and that
guidelines for funding "are still being finalized" by ministry officials.

"The government takes seriously the concerns of all of our stakeholders,
including literary magazines," the statement noted.

"Many of these magazines participated in our public consultations on the new
program last year, and we will continue to consult with stakeholders as we
work on finalizing the details of the Canada Periodical Fund."

A while back there was a brief thread about Keith Wilson's passing.
Can someone give me a mailing address for Heloise?
I have a couple old snapshots to send her.

A gerund and your friend.

MIME-Version: 1.0

I would like to announce the publication of Simon Pettet's wonderful new
book HEART:


Simon Pettet
HEARTH

Talisman House, Publishers
ISBN: 978-1-58498-061-2
$17.95
Paper, 9x6


=93The complete works =97 so far =97 of contemporary American and British p=
oetry's
most meticulous craftsperson. We dig the purity,  dogged love, and artistic
devotion of this rare personage.  A highly recommended volume.=94 =97Alice
Notley

=93In these mostly unabashedly lyrical poems Simon Pettet flaunts his proud
independence of current poetic fashions, like a dragonfly shimmering and
hovering.=94 =97Gerrit Lansing

=93=91Heart=92 and =91Earth,=92 the obvious scenery as Simon=92s I-liner tr=
ips us
through the decades, sometimes blind-embossing a snapshot, sometimes lookin=
g
at himself observing it, sometimes spattering it with apposite allusion.
Take the ride and enjoy the scene.=94 =97Tom Raworth

=93The poems of Simon Pettet are placed on continual high alert in a rush o=
f
subtle coloring. The shadings match those of affectionate curiosity and
cut-through street wisdom. Pettet sees through the moment to the words that
restore the moment's contours.=94 =97Bill Berkson

=93I highly recommend Simon Pettet's new collected, *Hearth*. His poetry is
always insightful, ardent, playful, right on the spot, and ahead of the
current.=94 =97Joanne Kyger


Simon Pettet=92s many books include his *Selected Poems* and *More Winnowed
Fragments*, both published by Talisman. He edited *The Selected Art Writing=
s
* of James Schuyler and collaborated with Duncan Hannah on *Abundant
Treasures* and with Rudy Burckhardt on *Conversations About Everything* and
*Talking Pictures*. British by birth, he lives in New York City.


Simon Pettet's HEARTH is available in good bookstores and Amazon and can be
ordered from

New from Palm Press:

Disaster Suites by Rob Halpern

"A paradox sets these disquieting Disaster Suites into motion. They =
produce a music--missing in the count now counts as one--reaching for =
the disappearance of the conditions that make it audible: war, so-called =
natural catastrophe, a public sphere where there is no / Public. As in =
the songs of William Blake and the sci-fi of Octavia Butler, these =
Suites sing against their own beauty and their seemingly perpetual =
present, which is why they seem so strangely archaic and futuristic at =
once.

In complex patterns of meter and rhyme, Disaster's "I" summons its own =
kind of "counting" against the physics of finance and exchange. Yet the =
music that results can only be heard--the drowned and the bombed--in =
between and against the other tracks which Halpern intricately lays =
down: the signing of capital, the burble of mass media, the daily noise =
of bodies who work, fuck and love. This stunning book made me fall in =
love with lyric poetry all over again."--Sianne Ngai

Dear friends & colleagues:

Users of PennSound downloaded 4 million mp3 sound recordings and
related media files in the past month. At this point, we are
projecting 50 million downloads for 2009.

This is far, far beyond what we expected when we created PennSound in
2003-04, and we're grateful that the project is receiving such a
positive response.

This has been driving me nuts. Why did I think that Giuseppe Logan
lived in Denmark?
Who did I have him mixed up with?
I mean what ESPecially?

Oh, around 1966-1976 ESP Disk ran my imagination.
It was so sweetly exciting and mysterious, all that time.
Whatever, I want to know, happened to Noah Webster?

But my two little dogs, who were brought up on Coltrane and Milford
Graves,
would run out of the room when I put a Giuseppe Logan record on.

And I still have them! Vinyl!

Tribeca Film Festival, Tel Aviv, NYC, Sao Paulo

Dear Friends:

I am excited to announce that "Vegas: Based on a True
Story" has been selected for COMPETITION for 2009
Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. The film is
directed by Amir Naderi and Rattapallax helped to
produce it. Festival is from April 22-May 3, 2009.
More details below. Please join us for several other
events being held in New York City, Sao Paulo and Tel
Aviv.

Screening of films from Rattapallax magazine.

March 25, 2009 at 19:00 hrs at Tel Aviv Cinematheque,
2 Sprinzak St., Tel Aviv, Israel. Phone: +972 3 691
7181 http://www.cinema.co.il

Rattapallax and PEN World Voices Film Festival. April
27-May 3, 2009. New York City, USA.

------

VEGAS: BASED ON A TRUE STORY. Vegas: Based on a True
Story

TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL 2009. Returning to the Festival,
acclaimed director Amir Naderi applies his inimitable
cinematic style to Vegas. The film takes place away
from the glittering strip of luxury mega casinos, but
the judgment-clouding greed of Sin City is just as
pervasive on the desert outskirts of town, where an
otherwise happy family is thrown into turmoil after
learning of a forgotten fortune that maybe buried
underneath their scrubby little home. Directed by Amir
Naderi, written  by Susan Brennan, Bliss Esposito,
Charlie Lake Keaton, and Naderi.

Some of you might be interested in a posting today on my blog =
poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com of an exchange of email letters circa 2003 =
with Jackson Mac Low.  The exchange, most notably on Jackson's part, =
goes from a discussion of compositional methods for his Light Poems to =
other matters of a political and personal nature.  This is my 110th =
posting since last June, an ongoing attempt to empty my archives and, =
particularly when I post the work of others close to me, to get =
something like the pleasure I've gotten in constructing anthologies and =
magazines.

Hi all,

Boog Reader's straight from the archives and now online:

BR2: Katie Degentesh's I Didn't Build This Machine

http://welcometoboogcity.com/boogreaders/br02.pdf


BR3: For Kurt on His 37th Birthday
At 2:06 a.m. on Feb. 17, 2004 I emailed 51 poets asking them for
Nirvana acrostics by 3 p.m. that same day, three days before what
would have been Kurt Cobain's 37th birthday and a live performance of
Nirvana's In Utero Boog was putting on. These 13 writers met the call:

Todd Colby, Sean Cole, Shanna Compton, Jordan Davis, Erica Kaufman,
Aaron Kiely, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Tony Rubin, Alan Semerdjian,
Jill Stengel, Edwin Torres, Dana Ward, Ian Wilder, and Stephanie Young.

To anyone in the vicinity of New York and Boston who might be =
interested:

=20

Diane Rothenberg and I will be traveling again - between March 19 and =
April 11 - staying with Ellen Zweig on Hudson Street in Tribeca.  The =
best way to reach us will be at this email address (jrothenberg@cox.net =
) or on our cell phone: 760-415-9889.

=20

In line with publication of Poems for the Millennium, volume 3, and the =
new book of essays, Poetics & Polemics, I'll be engaged in the following =
launches and readings:

=20

March 29, 8:00 p.m. at the Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery (Between =
Houston and Bleecker),  a launch and reading with Jeffrey Robinson, =
Charles Bernstein, Bob Holman, Pierre Joris, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, and Anne =
Waldman.

=20

March 30, 7:00 p.m., a reading at Harvard University, Barker Center, =
Thompson Room, with Jeffrey Robinson, Gerrit Lansing, and Keith Waldrop, =
and a panel discussion with scholars Virginia Jackson and Sonia Hofkosh =
(Tufts University) joining the readers.=20

=20

April 2, 7:30 p.m., a launch and reading at St Mark's Bookshop,with =
Jeffrey Robinson, Bruce Andrews, Lee Ann Brown, Bob Perelman, and Mark =
Weiss.  The reading itself will be at the Solas Bar, right around the =
corner from St Mark's Bookshop, at 232 9th Street, between 3rd and 2nd =
avenues.

=20

April 3, 2:00 p.m., a reading and panel discussion at CUNY Graduate =
Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, between 34th and 35th Streets, Room 9207, with =
Jeffrey Robinson, Mary Ann Caws, Maureen McLane, and Richard Sieburth.

=20

I'll also be reading new poems and translations at the Zinc Bar, 82 West =
3rd Street, on
Sunday, April 5, at 6:30 p.m., with poet and anthropologist Renato =
Rosaldo. =20

=20

A Final Note.   For those of you for whom it might be of interest, there =
remains a real need for reviews of both of these books, particularly for =
a discussion of the premeditated contemporaneity of Poems for the =
Millennium, volume 3, something too often missed if the book isn't =
actually seen or read.  I am open also to future readings like those =
listed above and the previous ones on the west coast: San Francisco, Los =
Angeles, San Diego.

COURT GREEN 7
Call for Submissions
(Dossier: The 1970s)

Each issue of COURT GREEN features a dossier on a special topic or
theme.  For our seventh issue, we will feature a dossier on The
1970s.

We would like to see poems on all that decade entailed, as well as the
legacy thereof.  We are as interested in poems that invoke the icons
of and engage with the stereotypes of the 1970s as we are in poems
that explore more tangential or atypical aspects of the decade. Poems
of all styles and modes -- historical, personal, political,
confessional, formal, experimental, regional, global, nostalgic,
critical, hybrid, and especially those styles and modes the editors
have not yet foreseen -- are welcome.   We are not looking for
critical/academic works at this time.

Submissions for dossier and regular sections of the magazine are
welcome.

If you would like to submit poems for either or both sections, our
submission period is March 1-June 30 of each year.

We do not accept more than one submission per poet during our
submission/reading period.  Please note that we do not accept more
than five pages of poetry.

Email submissions are not accepted.  Please supply a SASE for
notification only.  Submissions will not be returned.  Poems submitted
outside our reading period will be returned unread.

We will respond by August 31.

Submit to:

Editors
COURT GREEN
English Department
Columbia College Chicago
600 South Michigan Avenue
Chicago, IL  60605

Please note:  poems sent through submissions services are discouraged
and may be returned unread.  We strongly encourage anyone interested
in submitting to COURT GREEN to read a recent issue of the magazine
before submitting.  For information about ordering copies of Court
Green, please see our contact page:

This has been driving me nuts. Why did I think that Giuseppe Logan
lived in Denmark?
Who did I have him mixed up with?
I mean what ESPecially?

Oh, around 1966-1976 ESP Disk ran my imagination.
It was so sweetly exciting and mysterious, all that time.
Whatever, I want to know, happened to Noah Webster?

But my two little dogs, who were brought up on Coltrane and Milford
Graves,
would run out of the room when I put a Giuseppe Logan record on.

And I still have them! Vinyl!

Dear Friends:
=20
We at Atticus/Finch are extremely proud to announce the release of David La=
rsen's Names of the=20
Lion, a translation of the lexiconographic work of Arabic linguist al-Husay=
n ibn Ahmad ibn=20
Khalawayh. However, the word "translation" does little justice to Larsen's =
incredible labor on=20
this book. Culled from an interest in visual art, poetry, and scholarship, =
the book acts as a=20
rhizome of Larsen's incredible wit, humor, lyricism, and erudition. Those i=
n and around the Bay=20
Area will certainly appreciate the necessity and immediacy of Larsen's myri=
ad activities. Others=20
(perhaps readers of his indelible book of poetry The Thorn (Faux Books)) wi=
ll certainly want to=20
investigate the full spectrum of his poetic activity. Featuring a lengthy i=
ntroduction, footnotes,=20
and a letterpress cover transferred from Larsen's original linocut, this bo=
ok promises to stand as=20
one of the truly unique objects of the year.
=20
Needless to say, these will sell fast, so buy now or cry later! Visit our w=
ebsite=20
(www.atticusfinch.org) to take a look at the cover (and a sample page), and=
 to pay using our pay=20
pal link. You may also pay by check if it is more convenient by sending ten=
 dollars to the=20
following address: Michael Cross / 3004 East Yesler Way Apt. B / Seattle WA=

And if you live near NYC, please join us on Tuesday, March 31st at 6:00 pm =
for the east coast book=20

Hello everyone,

Just a quick reminder of a great reading happening in New York this
Friday:

LISA ROBERTSON and SINA QUEYRAS - MARCH 20

On Friday, March 20th, the City University of New York's Graduate
Center presents two acclaimed Canadian poets who have both done
remarkable things with the lyric essay form. Coach House Books, one of
Canada's most noted avant-garde presses, has recently published the
new collections Lisa Robertson's Magenta Soul Whip by Lisa Robertson
and Expressway by Sina Queyras. Robertson and Queyras will read from
these brand-new works and participate in a discussion.


Lisa Robertson -- Governor General's Award nominee, author of The
Weather and The Men and frequent cross-genre collaborator -- visits
from San Francisco to launch Lisa Robertson's Magenta Soul Whip, a new
book of previously uncollected poems essays, drafts, reports,
treatises and laments. Toronto's Eye Weekly calls it an 'exuberant,
saucy approach to the materiality of language and vice versa.'

Sina Queyras -- Lambda Literary Award winner, former co-curator of the
Belladonna series and noted literary blogger (lemonhound.blogspot.com)
-- visits from Montreal to launch Expressway, her new collection that
uses the modes of the Romantic poets to explore the world of modern
transportation and mobility. Check out the trailer for Expressway at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui9Qw_RtWRk


Lisa Robertson and Sina Queyras in New York City

Friday, March 20
CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York
Room 9204

AT THE WHITNEY: FLARF VERSUS CONCEPTUAL WRITING

On Friday, April 17 the Whitney Museum of American Art presents eight =20=

poets associated with two cutting-edge movements in contemporary =20
poetry: the Flarf Collective and Conceptual Writing. The followers of =20=

both movements employ technology to create their works, often using =20
strategies familiar to the visual arts: appropriation, falsification, =20=

insincerity, and plagiarism.  Fusing the avant-garde impulses of the =20
last century with the technologies of the present, these strategies =20
propose an expanded field for twenty-first century poetry. This new =20
writing is not bound exclusively between pages of a book; it =20
continually morphs from printed page to webpage, from gallery space =20
to science lab, from social spaces of poetry readings to social =20
spaces of blogs. It is a poetics of flux, celebrating instability and =20=

uncertainty.

Featured poets are Christian B=F6k, Nada Gordon, Kenneth Goldsmith, =20
Sharon Mesmer, K. Silem Mohammad, Kim Rosenfield, Gary Sullivan and =20
Darren Wershler.

This event was conceived and organized by poet Kenneth Goldsmith on =20
the occasion of the Jennny Holzer exhibition PROTECT PROTECT.  =20
Reading begins at 7, and is free with Museum Admission, which is pay-=20
what-you-wish during Whitney After Hours on Fridays from 6-9 pm.  =20
Advance reservations are recommended. Tickets may be reserved at the =20
Museum Admissions desk or online at http://www.whitney.org. =20
Inquiries: (212) 570-7715 or public_programs@whitney.org/=

=C2=A0=20
The Book of Colors and Painters contains a 15 page poem (titled The Book of=
 Colors) and 6 shorter poems that complete each other. The Book of Colors a=
ttempts to create a community of colors, each having its own personality, a=
long with the richness of relationships one can find in a community. By mea=
ns of parentheses, footnotes, and parentheses in the footnotes, the poem tr=
ies to create multiple-voices and depth. The poem is organized like a one-a=
ct play with its opening, introduction, development, and closure. The secti=
ons - 15 in number - create a rhythm through which new themes are introduce=
d and overlapped on the previous ones.=20



Korkut Onaran, originally from Turkey, lives in Boulder, Colorado. He pract=
ices architecture and urban design and teaches in University of Colorado as=
 an assistant professor adjunct. He has received the second prize in 2006 B=

Description: The Curvature of Blue traverses an arc from the personal to th=
e social and historical to the cosmic and philosophical. As a scientist and=
 poet, Lucille Lang Day goes beyond celebration of the natural world to exp=
lore the intersections of science, nature, and human experience, and to mel=
d scientific accuracy with intuition and emotional response. Whether writin=
g about jellyfish, war, or her own experience, she draws attention to impor=
tant questions and inspires us to think more deeply about what it means to =
be human and how our choices affect the planet Earth.=20



"In Lucille Lang Day's poems, stunning transformations of language cross th=
e placenta barrier between the worlds of science and human emotion. She thi=
nks and feels in color, enabling us to inhabit the complexity of the univer=
se-as experienced at breakfast with a lover, in the wild with caribou, or i=
n meditations on acts of historical horror-all made radiant by her lyric gi=
fts and wisdom."=20
-Teresa Cader=20

"Intelligence enjoying itself, awareness at play, attentiveness dancing thr=
ough life's minefields: smiling at itself in its new black car ("Nor have I=
 shunned onyx jewelry. That would be foolish"), Lucille Lang Day will at fi=
rst glance make you smile and smile again. Then, with her scientist's mind,=
 her woman's heart, her pain at injustice and evil, and her poet's eye and =
ear, she will carry you "through the mountains and canyons of space-time" t=
o a fuller humanity. The Curvature of Blue is a wonderful book and I feel l=
ucky to have read it"=20
-Alicia Ostriker=20

"Is the sky blue? Day's poems paint it a hundred different ways, full of ge=
ometry and change, structure and feeling, as plangent as a sunset, as secre=
t as an electromagnetic field. Divine love holds the physical parts togethe=
r, even as human love and its marvelous stories are the substance of our li=
ves. Here are witty, intelligent, affectionate poems making grand, skeptica=
l comparisons and painting us and our shadows in brilliant colors--perfect =
poems for our time."=20
-F.D.Reeve=20


Describing the Monarchs=20

"Too bad that 'bloom' is overused," you say=20
As we stand beneath a eucalyptus tree,=20
Your arm around me, head bent back to see=20
The monarchs celebrating New Year's Day.=20
"And 'burn' is wrong, and 'rust' suggests decay,=20
But I like 'bless'" A thousand blessings cling,=20
Each with white spots on black-and-orange wings,=20
To branches unaccustomed to such beauty=20

But burn they do: each tiny, beating flame=20
Lights up the tree, a bloom that's made of fire,=20
Flickering in winter to proclaim=20
A leaf gives solace, milkweed sates desire.=20
They smolder, cool as rust, in spangled air,=20
Then fly like sparks, illuminating the year.=20

Thomas Meyer's Kintsugi available now through Punch Press.



"Sit so you don't hurt the grass," says Meyer. "An impossible grace."
Robert Kelly remarks in his foreword, "Tom calls the forty-eight
threnodic pulses of his observation of Jonathan's dying, his own
surviving, by a curious Japanese word, kintsugi, which he describes as
the 'practice of repairing ceramics with gold-laced lacquer to
illuminate the breakage.' So the very rupture is what is highlighted:
the error becomes the meaning of the text."

Jesme reads from "The Plum-Stone Game," her SPD bestselling book. "She is
refreshingly unafraid of the sensual power of poetry, its difficulties, and
its ability to comprehend the larger sphere of being."=97D.A. Powell

Holmes reads from "The ms of my kin" from Shearsman Books, a book that take=
s
Emily Dickinson's poems from the start of the Civil War and makes of them
poems about the start of the Iraq War. "In the tradition of Tom Phillips' *=
A
Humument* and Ronald Johnson's *RADI OS, *Janet Holmes mines or excises
Emily Dickinson's Civil War period poems to engender a vision of the curren=
t
wars in the Middle East that is both a ticker-tape of the spirit and a Spoo=
n
River Anthology of the soul; that war is war and its words already written.=

Somerville: A City of Writers. The Paris of New England.

By Doug Holder
Off The Shelf

I just read in the New Yorker that the late novelist David Foster Wallace=
 lived=20
in Somerville for a while in the 80's and even had a "residency" at my wo=
rk=20
place (for the last 26 years) - McLean Hospital. I am also reminded that=20=

Jonathan Franzen lived here and used to buy chicken wings at Market Baske=
t -=20
he was on a low budget. This is just the tip of the iceberg of course.

Somerville, Massachusetts, a city on the outskirts of Boston and Cambridg=
e,=20
has often been called the "Paris of New England." Maybe at one time, when=
=20
the city was a down-at-the heels old industrial town, it was said with to=
ngue=20
in cheek - but no more. The UTNE READER opined that Davis Square is the=20=

hippest Square in the country, and a study in the tony literary magazine=20=

GRANTA reported that Somerville has more writers per-capita than Manhatta=
n.=20
In this charged literary milieu, I am able to entertain my passion for=20=

interviewing, more specifically: interviewing Poets and Writers. I happen=
 to be=20
very lucky to be the Arts Editor for The Somerville News, and to have my =
own=20
column "Off the Shelf." This gives me a sort of license to tap the rich l=
ode of=20
writers and artists who live in my burg. I have interviewed people in my=20=

favorite caf=E9 Sherman in the Union Square section of the city, in my st=
udy on=20
School St, on my Somerville Community Access TV show " Poet to Poet: Writ=
er=20
to Writer," in the offices of The Somerville News, and at my regular writ=
ers'=20
group the "Bagel Bards," to name a few spots. I decided to compile the ma=
ny=20
interviews I have conducted in a collection "From the Paris of New Englan=
d:=20
Interviews with Poets and Writers." (Ibbetson Street). Here is a review o=

It's really true, Somerville, Massachusetts, right next to Cambridge, is =
a kind of=20
New England Paris, all kinds of little eateries and galleries and everyth=
ing-else-
ries, like an Asian market, a Peruvian cafe, you name it. And what Holder=
 has=20
done here is to take the interviews he has done with Somerville (and othe=
r=20
fancy-wancy, avant-garde, or no-guard-at-all) writers, bookstore owners,=20=

publishers, etc. and put them together in a book -- with photos.=20

Masterfully done, Holder really brings the Somerville lit-world alive, al=
ive, alive.=20
There's Louisa Solano, who ran the Grolier Poetry Book Shop for over thir=

My first intro to Tchicai was when he recorded with the New York Eye & Ear
Control  - one hell of an album. I can't remember the name of the group
under his  own name but that was pretty incredible as well. I think he might
have appeared on a Roswell Rudd lp for Impulse. Then I lost track of him.
Great to hear he's playing again - and with Robinson whose clarinet playing,
particularly in his third-world fusion stuff, I love. Man, I wish  I could
attend that concert.

just wanted to let folks know we are looking for work for issue 3 of
aslongasittakes (www.aslongasittakes.org)--- submissions are rolling,
but we hope to have issue 3 out in late april/early may-- the official
call for work is below
thanks,

“How long is a poem? As long as it takes to perform it.” --Bob Cobbing

a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s, a sound poetry magazine published by the
Atlanta Poets Group, is seeking submissions. We are looking for sound
poetry, scores for sound poetry and essays on sound poetry. “What is
‘sound poetry’?” you ask. Good question. It’s one of those know it when
you see (hear) it kind of things. It’s probably not music (thanks Dick
Higgins). It might be noise. If you think about a spectrum of possible
noise made by the human body (or simulations thereof or substitutions
therefor), and at one end of the spectrum is a person reading her poem
and at the other end is abstract noise, we’re looking for works that
fall towards the latter end. We are looking for works in/of/against the
tradition(s) of Ball, Schwitters, Dûfrène, Henri Chopin, Jandl, Cobbing,
The Four Horsemen, Fylkingen Group, Öyvind Fahlström. . . hopefully by
now you get the idea. We’re looking for stuff that will push/redefine
the limits. The magazine is Web-based.

“How long is a poem? As long as it takes to perform it.” --Bob Cobbing

a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s, ein Webmagazin für Lautpoesie, das bei
der Atlanta Poets Group erscheint, akzeptiert noch Beiträge für die
Erstausgabe. Wir sind auf der Suche nach Lautpoesie, Scores und Essays
über Lautpoesie. "Was ist Lautpoesie?" fragt man. Gute Frage. Man
erkennt sie, wenn man sie sieht oder hört. Wahrscheinlich ist es keine
Musik (danke Dick Higgins). Es könnte Lärm sein, Geräusche. Man stelle
sich das gesamte Spektrum menschlicher Geräusche vor (oder auch
Simulationen und Nachahmungen dieser) und an einem Ende dieses Spektrums
ist jemand, der ein Gedicht liest und am anderen Ende ist ein abstrakter
Laut, dann suchen wir eher nach Beiträgen, die zu letzterem Ende
tendieren. Wir suchen nach Arbeiten in der-, beziehungsweise in
Anlehnung an-, oder auch gegen die Tradition Balls, Schwitters’,
Dûfrènes, Henri Chopins, Jandls, Cobbings, The Four Horsemens ...
Hoffentlich ist jetzt klar was gemeint ist. Wir suchen Arbeiten, die an
die Grenzen gehen und sie neu definieren. a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s
ist als Onlinemagazin konzipiert.

Bitte sendet uns (Geräusch-)Beiträge als mp3, wav, wma, oder flac files
an aslongasittakes@comcast.net <mailto:aslongasittakes@comcast.net>.
Scores und Essays gerne als Word oder pdf Dokumente. Falls ihr andere
Formate bevorzugt, fragt bitte vorher an. Wenn ihr eure Beiträge nicht
per E-Mail schicken könnt, sagt bescheid und wir finden eine andere
Lösung. Reicht ihr eine Arbeit ein, wissen wir nicht, wie lange es
dauert bis wir uns zurückmelden, habt Geduld. Wir können kein Honorar
zahlen. Alle Beiträge, die im Magazin erscheinen, werden zum download
von unserer Seite zur Verfügung stehen, gemäß der Creative Commons’

deinem Sinne sein, deine Arbeit so zur Verfügung zu stellen, sag uns

<>aslongasittakes, un magazine de poésie publié par le group, the

“Hur långt är ett poem? Så långt som det tar att framföra det.” –Bob
Cobbing

a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s, ett ljudpoesi magasin publicerat av
Atlanta Poets Group söker förslag till öppningsnumret. Vi söker efter
rader av ljudpoesi och essäer av ljudpoesi. ”Vad är ’ljudpoesi’?” Kanske
du undrar, bra fråga. Det är en sån där sak som man vet vad det är när
man ser (hör) det. Det är nog inte musik (tack Dick Higgins) det kan
vara oväsen. Om du tänker dig ett spektra av möjliga oväsen gjorda av
den mänskliga kroppen (eller simuleringar därav eller ersättningar
därför), i en ända av spektrat är en person som läser hennes dikt och i
den andra ändan är det abstrakt oväsen, vi letar efter verk som lutar
mot det sistnämnda. Vi letar efter verk i/av/i mot traditionen av Ball,
Schwitters ,Dûfrène, Henri Chopin, Jandl, Cobbing, The Four Horsemen,
Fylkingen Group, Öyvind Fahlström… Förhoppningsvis förstår du nu vad vi
menar. Vi letar efter saker som kommer att flytta/omdefiniera
gränserna.Magasinet kommer att vara webb-baserat.

Vänligen skicka in bidrag till aslongasittakes@comcast.net i något av
följande format: .mp3, .wav, .wma, eller .flac. Noter eller essäer som
Word-dokument eller .pdf. Var vänlig kontrollera med oss innan du
skickar i något annat format. Ifall du inte kan skicka in ditt bidrag
via e-post, var vänlig hör av dig för alternativa vägar. Vi vet ej hur

<>Aslongasittakes, una rivista di poesia sonora pubblicata da Atlanta
Poets Group, sta cercando proposte per il suo numero inaugurale.
Cerchiamo sia poesie sonore che saggi sulla poesia sonora. Che cos’e’ la
“poesia sonora”? Bella domanda. E’ una di quelle cose che capisci quando
le vedi (senti). Probabilmente non e’ musica (grazie Dick Higgins).
Potrebbe essere rumore. Se si pensa a uno spettro di possibile rumore
creato dal corpo umano (oppure simulazioni o sostituzioni di esso), a un
capo dello spettro c’è una persona che legge una sua poesia e all’altro
capo dello spettro c’è del rumore astratto, noi cerchiamo lavori che
inclinino di più verso il secondo capo. Cerchiamo opere
nella/della/contro la tradizione di Ball, Schwitters, Dûfrène, Henri
Chopin, Jandl, Cobbing, The Four Horsemen… speriamo di aver reso l’idea.
Cerchiamo roba che spinga/ridefinisca i limiti. La rivista si pubblica
sul web. <>

Thomas Meyer's Kintsugi available now through Punch Press.



"Sit so you don't hurt the grass," says Meyer. "An impossible grace."
Robert Kelly remarks in his foreword, "Tom calls the forty-eight
threnodic pulses of his observation of Jonathan's dying, his own
surviving, by a curious Japanese word, kintsugi, which he describes as
the 'practice of repairing ceramics with gold-laced lacquer to
illuminate the breakage.' So the very rupture is what is highlighted:
the error becomes the meaning of the text."

An Online Exhibition of Mobile Media Images  A diary is a daily record
of events and experiences. Because of the accessibility and
instantaneous nature of camera phones, people are turning into
spontaneous photojournalists. They are becoming more aware of their
surroundings and more apt to capture aspects of everyday life. From
the mundane to the spectacular, images are being inconspicuously
captured and transmitted through the wireless infrastructure. These
versatile images are an immediate document of daily life and have a
unique aesthetic because of their lo-fi/low-resolution quality.

You are invited to participate in this new online gallery. Please
submit your daily mobile images to mobile.image.gallery@gmail.com.
You can email them directly from your phone as a multimedia message
(mms) or email them as jpegs. Selected images will be featured weekly
on this site. This is an experiment of sorts to see how we are
choosing to encapsulate our daily lives.

This came from a group of Indian writers. Ancient issue and that's why, all
the more, it needs your support.

Hi, You remember the monks marching for democracy in Burma a couple of years
ago who were brutally attacked by the military regime?Many of them were
locked away and since then been languishing in brutal Burmese prisons. But
now brave ex prisoners and activists are pushing for the release of all
political prisoners, including Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. Ex
Presidents are supporting their campaign and the UN is finally beginning to
get some out of jail. I just signed a petition calling on UN Secretary
General Ban Ki Moon to prioritise their release. The more of us that sign,
the more we make clear that the release of all prisoners is important to
citizens across the world. You can sign below and tell your friends!

JACKET DESCRIPTION: Assuming the form of postcards authored by an "alien" of
unknown nationality, ethnicity, and gender, addressing a variety of people
and organizations (political figures, multinational corporations, people in
public toilets, John Barr, et al), _Big American Trip_ is a startling
document of fear and loneliness in the 21st century U.S. Whether
deconstructing road signs, a failed relationship, or the state of
contemporary poetry, the voice behind these texts is at once familiar and
strange, determined to be free, and desperate to communicate with anyone who
has ever felt at odds with the Language of a Nation.

SEE ALSO: The companion YouTube project, involving a diverse group of
activists, actors, artists, musicians, and writers performing video readings
/ interpretations of individual postcards, may be seen here:
http://bigamericantrip.blogspot.com

SOME RESPONSES TO _BIG AMERICAN TRIP_:

The complexities of alienation hybridize the mouth, double the tongue.
Derrida writes, “What does a post card want to say to you? On what
conditions is it possible? Its destination traverses you, you no longer know
who you are…instead of reaching you it divides you…it leaves you, it gives
you.” Christian Peet’s _Big American Trip_ embodies the enigma of the
postcard—writing that is at once private and public—and like all letters,
these maintain a sense of internal drifting that requires us to question our
own sense of identity and location. The logic of Peet’s syntax and
juxtapositions gives us the poetry of the divided tongue: in the space
between multiple languages, we are invited to trespass our own borders that
we might hear (and learn to speak) radical loss. A whole new spin on the
classic postcard message: “wish you were here,” _Big American Trip_ is a
remarkable, necessary book, and a wonderful achievement.
—Selah Saterstrom, author of _The Meat & Spirit Plan_ and _The Pink
Institution_

In _Big American Trip_, Christian Peet rejects the idyllic dream of a
post-national freedom, instead going back to those two archaic, fundamental
tools of American nation building—the highway system and the postcard—not to
find an imagined national community but to reveal the strangeness, violence
and noise that results from the U.S. clashing with other cultures, languages
and nations, and—just as importantly—clashing with itself.
—Johannes Göransson, author of _A New Quarantine Will Take My Place_ and
_Pilot_, co-editor of Action Books and _Action, Yes_

Samuel Richardson's epistolary novel Pamela is a sad and hilarious book full
of devastating social commentary about money, power, sex and British social
mores. A couple centuries later, Christian Peet has updated poor Pamela's
well behaved letters into blistering postcards dashed off by a nervy,
distraught human being of indeterminate gender who is both losing and
finding him/herself in and across a terrifying pre-Obama America. Stamp this
one with approval.
—Rebecca Brown, author of _The Last Time I Saw You_, _The End of Youth_,
_Excerpts From A Family Medical Dictionary_, _The Gifts of the Body_, _The
Terrible Girls_, and others

The author of these postcards has transcribed this alien’s heart. Peet
drives through the US landscape (circa early 21st century), offers us the
hijacked language of a nation, and through this text asks: and what words
have been left for you to use, honestly?
—Elena Georgiou, author of _mercy mercy me_ and the forthcoming _Rhapsody of
the Naked Immigrant_

George Bowering: Bridges to Elsewhere

OPEN LETTER SPECIAL ISSUE

In 2008, George Bowering summarized his long literary career in Canada
by stressing his activities as an intermediary: =93I think that if I
have any place in the history of Canadian poetry, it is as a kind of
bridge figure.=A0 I have always wanted to make you sure that I belong to
a peculiar West Coast poetry group or movement that is way out there,
but I have always thought myself to be considered part of the newer
establishment in Toronto, where Canadian literature is gathered and
sent to market.=A0 All my adult life I have explained or defended one
side to the other.=94=A0 Critics such as Roy Miki, Frank Davey, and Fred
Wah have been very effective in establishing the importance of the
TISH movement to Canadian poetry, but the impact of Bowering=92s work
outside of =96 or extending from =96 this critical nexus is a neglected
field of study.

This special issue of Open Letter invites critics to broaden the
horizons of Bowering criticism and investigate new paradigms for
assessing his work.=A0 Key questions include, but are not limited to,
the following:

* How can critics make sense of Bowering=92s claim: =93I=92m in the old
guard and the avant-garde=94?

* How has Bowering influenced or been influenced by American Language poets=
?

* How can critics read Bowering=92s work outside the locus of Vancouver?
 Can we see Bowering as a Calgary, Toronto, London, or Montreal

ghting spirit that you all knew and loved until close to the end, not=0Awil=
ling to give in to death unless there were good writers involved.

It=0Awas Shakespeare that carried him over. At one point in the afternoon=
=0ASal asked when Shakespeare would be arriving. I held his hand and said=
=0Athat Shakespeare was on his way. He asked if Shakespeare would be=0Ataki=
ng him upstairs. I said that yes, Shakespeare was coming to take=0Ahim upst=
airs, and once there they=E2=80=99d meet up with Neruda and Cervantes=0Aand=
 Lorca, and they=E2=80=99d talk about poetry together. I told him there wer=
e=0Alots of un-unionized workers that needed to be organized, and lots of=
=0Apoets waiting for him in heaven, and that Shakespeare would be arriving=
=0Avery soon to guide him there. Sal began repeating, =E2=80=9CShakespeare =
is=0Acoming... Shakespeare is coming. He=E2=80=99s coming soon...=E2=80=9D =
His body=0Auntensed, and he fell into a quiet sleep. I sat with him for awh=
ile,=0Aholding my hand over his heart, whispering that Shakespeare would be=
=0Athere before too long, that we all love him, but that he was free to go.

It=0Awas the most peaceful sleep I=E2=80=99d seen in days, so I left him in=
 the care=0Aof his continuous-care nurse, an incredibly gentle & perceptive=
=0APakistani man named Erfan. Before I returned Sal=E2=80=99s spirit was go=
ne. He=0Ahad woken up briefly, and Erfan held him as his took his last brea=
ths.=0AShakespeare arrived to escort him upstairs.

Sal requested that=0Ahis ashes be scattered off of the Staten Island Ferry.=
 I will be in=0Atouch when arrangements are made for this to happen. Howeve=
r, in the=0Amean time please know that I read each and every one of the mes=
sages=0Aand poems that were sent to him by all of you. Even in his final da=
ys=0Athey never failed to make him smile, and he was truly amazed every tim=
e=0AI'd bring in a new pile. I believe they brought a measure of completion=
=0Ato his life that might not otherwise have been possible. Thank you.

New blog entry:
http://jeffreyside.tripod.com/
"The Dissembling Poet: Seamus Heaney and the Avant-garde"
I came across an interesting interview with Seamus Heaney (a recent recipie=
nt of the David Cohen prize for literature, being awarded =C2=A340,000) by =
Dennis O'Driscoll (=E2=80=98Beyond All This Fiddle=E2=80=99 ) where Heaney =
says about the avant-garde:
=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s an old-fashioned term by now. In literature, nobody c=
an cause bother any more. John Ashbery was a kind of avant-garde poet certa=
inly and now he=E2=80=99s become a mainstream voice. The work of the =E2=80=
=9CLanguage Poets=E2=80=9D and of the alternative poetries in Britain=E2=80=
=94associated with people in Cambridge University like J. H. Prynne=E2=80=
=94is not the charlatan work some perceive it to be; however, these poets f=
orm a kind of cult that shuns general engagement, regarding it as a vulgari=
ty and a decadence. There=E2=80=99s a phrase I heard as a criticism of W. H=
. Auden and I like the sound of it: somebody said that he didn=E2=80=99t ha=
ve the rooted normality of the major talent. I=E2=80=99m not sure the criti=
cism applies to Auden, but the gist of it is generally worth considering. E=
ven in T. S. Eliot, the big, normal world comes flowing around you. Robert =
Lowell went head-on at the times=E2=80=94there was no more literary poet ar=
ound, but at the same time he was like a great cement mixer: he just shovel=
led the world in and it delivered. Now that=E2=80=99s what I yearn for=E2=
=80=94the cement mixer rather than the chopstick.=E2=80=99
Several things about this statement need to be addressed, so I will go thro=
ugh it step-by-step to do so.....

Cunningham helpt clear my head. It was John Tchicai!
I remember once he trashed a Danish radio station with his horn.

Noah Howard. Odd to see his face in picture,
and he's not a kid anymore!

Hey, when Cecil Taylor said "For Olim", who was Olim?

Dear All,
My new book *Tomorrowland* is just out with Shearsman Books, with a cover
collage by Camille Martin -
I'll be reading in London with Erin Moure 31 March (Swedenborg House) & in
Manchester with Tim Atkins
and Philip Davenport 1 April (The Other Room). Please say hello if you do
come.
Books details below.
Lisa

~~

Lisa Samuels, *Tomorrowland*, Shearsman Books 2009. 104pp, 9x6ins, ISBN
9781848610507

http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2009/samuelsTOM.html

*Tomorrowland* is a booklength poem of bodily transit and colonial
forgetting. Its voices and events perpetually arrive in a new world, whose
versions here combine promised lands and historical suicide. Eula moves
among these real and imagined place-times with other symbolic names and
unnamed figures, and Jack plays death. The primary formal note is the
interrupted iambic.

The poems of *Tomorrowland* are dense, radiant, lyric divinations. Startlin=
g
in their jolting intensity and juxtapositions: *so still, you might think
young girls bodies had* *been used to make the air.* The astute focus never
falters or fades. One thinks of conjuration, of prophecy where there's no
separation between a green jacket and the ambiance of an afternoon, and thi=
s
sure magic will keep us safe into the future. The world joins itself in an
energetic twining of language, sound, picture, impulse: "at night she
sweated language on her sheets". If this is the future, bring it on.

- Anne Waldman

Lisa Samuels=92 *Tomorrowland* is a guidebook and diary from an actuality
existing among real sea and ships and coastline, history, and contemporary
reflection.  There are named =93characters,=94 but the true characters are =
a
colony, a =93we=94 of the newly arrived to this land.  The generous and gra=
ceful
syntax is a fusing agent for yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  The reader
exults in the accomplishment of the verse.

ABANDONED PRACTICES =AD something out of the ordinary
a NEW PERFORMANCE SUMMER INSTITUTE
Hosted by The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)

www.abandonedpractices.org <http://www.abandonedpractices.org>

Monday July 6th =AD Friday 24th 2009
Monday =AD Friday , 9.00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.
Instructors: Matthew Goulish, Lin Hixson, and Mark Jeffery

VISITING SCHOLARS=20
Dr. Jane Blocker, writer and Associate Professor, Director of Graduate
Studies, Art History Department, University of Minnesota
Dr. Paul Clarke, Research Fellow on 'Performing the Archive', University of
Bristol & Arnolfini (UK), and director of Uninvited Guests

This NEW PERFORMANCE SUMMER INSTITUTE looks forward by looking backward,
researching, enacting, and embodying practices that for one reason or
another have been disregarded in the wake of progress, and relegated to the
archives of history. Students will participate in individual and
collaborative projects involving writing, installation, documentation, and
live performance. Teachers and visiting scholars will lecture on related
subjects. Available for credit or non-credit enrolment.
=20
Abandoned practices constitutes an emerging field of inquiry pioneered by
Alan Read of King=B9s College, London, author of Theatre, Intimacy, and
Engagement: The Last Human Venue (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008). The course
focus will allow a thematic meeting place that confronts the common
accelerated temporalities of the 21st century, whether in the form of
economic and artistic globalization, technology=B9s ceaseless upgrade, or the
general shifts in understanding of the word local. The course does not
propose that we share a mutual past, but rather that we might mutually
discover a shared strategy of thinking about our pasts, a strategy of
reimagining and reenacting the different abandoned practices that once
defined the ordinary.
=20
Week one: Abandoned technologies. Mode: installation.
Forgotten machines, crafts, stagecrafts, thought as craft, the place of the
hand in art making, player pianos, slowness as resistance.
=20
Week two: Abandoned concepts. Mode: writing.
The archive as repository of outmoded ideas; the pastoral; the senses.
=20
Week three: Abandoned behavior. Mode: performance.
Forgotten labor practices; town criers; discontinued social customs.
=20
Abandoned Practices is available for non-credit registration at $1710.00,
half the regular graduate credit rate. Non SAIC degree-seeking students mus=
t
include: A short statement that may include education, training, influences=
,
beliefs, aims, why you wish to participate; plus documentation of your work
that may include one of the following: 10 slides and description list; audi=
o
or video documentation (maximum of 10 minutes); printed material or written
statement of your creative work.

Hey Listees! =0A=0AMillay Colony's=C2=A0first not-for-residents-only worksh=
op is=C2=A0coming right up. Here's the info:=0A=0AApril 29 to May 3=C2=A0 =
=0APoetry & Pop-Music =0AwithChris Stroffolino =0A=0AMost accounts of the h=
istory of poetry (both lyric and epic, or narrative), as well as the histor=
y of 'popular song' show the two have a common ancestor, or were one and th=
e same.=C2=A0 Despite the contemporary specialization between these genres,=
 lyric poetry and song lyrics still share many of the same assumptions, on =
the levels of both form and content. This workshop will explore whether the=
 boundary between these two genres (poetry and lyrics), especially as conce=
ived of during the "American Century," has largely outlived its usefulness,=
 and will consider seriously (and hopefully with pleasure as well) whether =
any discussion of "American Poetry" of the last 100 years ("modern") can ev=
en come close to being representative if it doesn't include "Ain't That A S=
hame," at least as much as, say, "The Red Wheelbarrow." =0A=0AWe will striv=
e to approach these issues in a non-dogmatic way. Depending on the needs & =
interests of the workshop participants), possible assignments include "tran=
slations" (from song-lyrics to poetry, and vice versa), music-criticism-as-=
an-artform, poems 'about' songs, songs 'inside' poems, formal issues, 3-dim=
ensional scansion, phonemes, music as metaphor, metaphor as music. "High" v=
s. "Low" culture; the raw and the cooked, Dada, didacticism, performance, p=
ersona, identity, nature. Students are encouraged to let the teacher know i=
n advance their particular interests; I'll do my best to accommodate.=0A=0A=
Chris Stroffolino is the author of 7 books of poetry, and prose criticism (=
including Spin Cycle (2001), a selection of essays on mostly contemporary p=
oetry, and with Dave Rosenthal, a critical study guide to Shakespeare's Twe=
lfth Night.) A recipient of a 2001 NYFA Grant and a 2008 Fund For Poetry gr=
ant, Stroffolino's work has appeared in A Body Electric, Isn=E2=80=99t It R=
omantic, and other anthologies, and has been translated into Dutch, Bengali=
 and Spanish. His music and cultural criticism has appeared in such venues =
as The Big Takeover, Kitchen Sink, and Oakbook (Novometro). He has also pla=
yed in various rock bands, including Silver Jews, Continuous Peasant and th=
e Root Rats. He was a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Poetry at St. Mar=
y's College from 2001-2006, and currently lives in Oakland.=0A=C2=A0=0AFor =

Although people have many different opinions about what should be done =
about
the U.S.-Mexico border and U.S. immigration policy, it is probably more
generally agreed that ideas, sound, and video should and can travel =
freely
across borders. Hundreds of miles of wall and fence separate the United
States and Mexico, but performers in Chicago, Tucson, Mexico City, =
Veracruz,
and Buenos Aires will be part of a long-distance, "telematic" =
performance
event which will perpendicularly run through the U.S.-Mexico border =
wall.
Artists in all these remote locations will interact with each other in =
real
time via the Internet on Tuesday, March 24, 2009.=20

In his book 'Pataphysics: The Poetics of an Imaginary Science, Christian Bok
makes the statement "this survey reflects the influence of Jarry upon my own
poetic career (in particular, my 'pataphysical encyclopedia,
Crystallography)." To my knowledge, this is the only North American book
that specifically claims to be or would be considered a 'pataphysical work.
Any comments?

(the transformation from original text to japanese manga to chinese
opera reminds me of all the babelfish translations we do)


http://www.metamute.org/en/das_kapital_to_be_transformed_into_chinese_music=
al

Perhaps a bit of fancy footwork and a catchy show tune is the key to
introducing a new generation to Karl Marx=92s Das Kapital. At least
that=92s what He Nian, director of the upcoming musical, is anticipating
for the Shanghai theatregoers. The play which is on schedule to open
next year, is meant to serve as a kind of =91edutainment=92 providing the
audience with amusement but also an intellectually sound
interpretation of Marx=92s work. Shanghaiist and The Guardian report
more extensively:

http://shanghaiist.com/2009/03/17/can_marxist_masterpiece_hit_the_chi.php

Screw Shakespeare and forget that Chinese opera business - right now,
preparations are underway to bring a sing-song version of Karl Marx's
Das Kapital to the Shanghai theater.

This particular rendition of Marx's treatise against capitalism is
borrowed from "a best-selling Japanese manga adaptation". We're not
sure if anime and Marxism go hand-in-hand, but He Nian, Das Kapital's
director has ambitious hopes for the play, according to Danwei:

He Nian says he will combine elements from animation, Broadway
musicals, and Las Vegas stage shows to bring Marx's economic theories
to life as a trendy, interesting, and educational play...

Hi John,

As for specific claims/examples of North American projects, there aren't
many that spring to mind that would be congruent with the scale, conception
& self-labeling of *Crystallography*, but I'm in line w/ Craig Dworkin when
he describes some conceptual projects as being egregiously/increasingly
'pataphysical.  I recall that on the final episode of Kareem Estefan's radio
show *Ceptuetics*, which is archived at PennSound, Dworkin points to
Goldsmith's *No 111* specifically & I would throw in Dworkin's recent,
excellent *Parse* as well.

Cheers,

Patrick

Anyone into Rossetti and aware of his text on Dante: la Beatrice di Dante
apparently only published once in Italian:
http://openlibrary.org/b/OL19946861M/Beatrice-di-Dante?

It comes up in Leon Surette's Birth of Modernism... anyway, anyone read it?
Know of plans to translate and publish it in English? and/or just what it
consists of--- aside from the argument that "beatrice was not a real woman
but an embodiment of philosophy"--- like is it more or less an extension of
material/ideas of Rossetti's to be found elsewhere...

Thanks,

Patrick

Hello, all--

A former student just wrote me to ask if I knew of any really good, comprehensive books on grammar (in the reference vein). Since it always came pretty naturally to me, I was impatient with grammar class in school, and never solidly learned a lot of the terminology; I could use a refresher myself. Does anyone out there have any recommendations for well-written, well-organized grammar books? He wants "the whole thing."

(I thought of you partly because Joe--the friend and former student--is reading essays on poetics, and trying to get more of the terminology therein).

cheers,

Andy

In writing about Christopher Dewdney's book of poetry, A Paleozoic
Geology of London Ontario (Toronto: Coach House 1973), Steve
McCaffery describes Dewdney's work as investigating "vertically and
structurally by means of an intellectual framework of 'pataphysical
model from which the principle can be examined in function under a
controlled situation. I mention 'pataphysics as that term comes
closest to describing Dewdney's methodology." This is in McCaffery's
essay, "Strata and Strategy: 'Pataphysics in the Poetry of
Christopher Dewdney," in North of Intention (New York & Toronto: Roof
& Nightwood 1986). I would think some of McCaffery's work should also
be considered 'pataphysical. One might do well to begin with his
magnificent book, Panopticon (Toronto: blewointmentpress 1984). In
addition, the work of the Toronto Research Group should be considered
in any study of 'pataphysical works in the last few decades. The best
collection of those works is by Steve McCaffery & bpNichol, Rational
Geomancy: The Kids of the Book-Machine, The Collected Research
Reports of the Toronto Research Group 1973-1982 (Vancouver: Talonbooks 1992).

Hello, all--

A former student just wrote me to ask if I knew of any really good,
comprehensive books on grammar (in the reference vein). Since it always
came pretty naturally to me, I was impatient with grammar class in
school, and never solidly learned a lot of the terminology; I could use
a refresher myself. Does anyone out there have any recommendations for
well-written, well-organized grammar books? He wants "the whole thing."=20

Jacket Magazine is looking for responses to an article I=E2=80=99ve written=
 on Seamus Heaney, and which touches on his association with The Group, Hob=
sbaum, early career etc., which can be found here:
http://jacketmagazine.com/37/heaney-side.shtml
At the time of writing, only the first part of the article is online, the s=
econd part should be online in a few hours.
Jacket especially needs articles, or shorter pieces, giving information or =
insights that might answer the question: =E2=80=9CHow did Heaney accomplish=
 in so relatively short a period the almost universal admiration he now enj=
oys given his fairly modest talent? (The phrasing is mine, not Jacket's) Ja=

may shed light on the mechanisms of his ascendency .

There was the John Tchicai--Irene Schweizer (or however you spell it)
Group,
but that was in the Seventies, I guess.

The CUNY Graduatte Center Poetics Group is very excited to announce =20
that the editors of Poems for the Millennium Volume Three: The =20
University of California Book of Romantic & Postromantic Poetry will =20
be with us to read from and discuss their new anthology. Like its two =20=

twentieth-century predecessors, Poems for the Millennium, volumes 1 =20
and 2, this gathering sets forth a globally decentered approach to =20
the poetry of the preceding century from a radically experimental and =20=

visionary perspective.  The range of volume three and its skewing of =20
the traditional canon illuminate the process by which romantics and =20
post-romantics challenged nineteenth-century orthodoxies and =20
propelled poetry to the experiments of a later modernism and avant-=20
gardism.  Joining Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson in the =20
open discussion that follows the reading are three distinguished =20
scholars and translators, Mary Ann Caws, Maureen McLane, and Richard =20
Sieburth.  =93Rothenberg and Robinson have dedicated this project to an =20=

A Special Reading with Ra=FAl Zurita and Daniel Borzutzky
Start: Friday, April 3, 2009 - 7:00pm

Sponsored by the Guild Complex
http://www.guildcomplex.org/

Time: Doors open at 7:00PM, Reading begins at 7:30PM.
Cost: Free admission, all ages.
Location: Instituto Cervantes, 31 West Ohio Street, Chicago

Ra=FAl Zurita was born in Santiago, Chile in 1951. He started out =20
studying mathematics before turning to poetry. His early work is a =20
ferocious response to Augusto Pinochet's 1973 military coup. Like many =20
other Chileans, Zurita was arrested and tortured. When he was =20
released, he helped to form a radical artistic group CADA, and he =20
became renowned for his provocative and intensely physical public =20
performances.

In the early 80=92s, Zurita famously sky-wrote passages from his poem, =20
The New Life, over Manhattan and later (still during the reign of =20
Pinochet) he bulldozed the phrase Ni Pena Ni Miedo (Without Pain Or =20
Fear) into the Atacama Desert, where it can still be seen because =20
children in the neighboring town bring shovels into the desert and =20
turn over the sand in the letters. For fifteen years, Zurita worked on =20
a trilogy which is considered one of the signal poetic achievements in =20
Latin American poetry: Purgatory appeared in 1979, Ante-paradise in =20
1982, and The New Life in 1993.

Ra=FAl Zurita is one of the most renowned contemporary Latin American =20
poets, and he is the recipient of numerous awards, including a =20
Guggenheim Fellowship and the National Poetry Prize of Chile. =20
Translations of Purgatory and Anteparadise were published in the =20
United States in the 80=92s.

Three new books, INRI, translated by William Rowe, Song of the =20
Disappeared Love, translated by Daniel Borzutzky, and Purgatory, =20
translated by Anna Deeny, are forthcoming from, respectively, Merick =20
Press, Action Books, and The University of California Press. His books =20
of poems include, among others: El Sermon de la Montana; Areas Verdes; =20
Purgatorio; Anteparadiso; El Paraiso Esta Vacio =96 Canto a Su Amor, =20
Desaparecido, El Amor de Chile, La Vida Nueva, In Memoriam.

Strunk and White, _The Elements of Style_ is kinda like, you know, my Bible.
Check with those teaching Freshman English.  They usually have their own
grammar texts.  I recall one called _Words and Ideas_ from many years ago.

(the transformation from original text to japanese manga to chinese
opera reminds me of all the babelfish translations we do)

Perhaps a bit of fancy footwork and a catchy show tune is the key to
introducing a new generation to Karl Marx=E2=80=99s Das Kapital. At least
that=E2=80=99s what He Nian, director of the upcoming musical, is anticipat=
ing
for the Shanghai theatregoers. The play which is on schedule to open
next year, is meant to serve as a kind of =E2=80=98edutainment=E2=80=99 pro=
viding the
audience with amusement but also an intellectually sound
interpretation of Marx=E2=80=99s work. Shanghaiist and The Guardian report
more extensively:

http://shanghaiist.com/2009/03/17/can_marxist_masterpiece_hit_the_chi.php

Screw Shakespeare and forget that Chinese opera business - right now,
preparations are underway to bring a sing-song version of Karl Marx's
Das Kapital to the Shanghai theater.

This particular rendition of Marx's treatise against capitalism is
borrowed from "a best-selling Japanese manga adaptation". We're
not
sure if anime and Marxism go hand-in-hand, but He Nian, Das Kapital's
director has ambitious hopes for the play, according to Danwei:

He Nian says he will combine elements from animation, Broadway
musicals, and Las Vegas stage shows to bring Marx's economic theories
to life as a trendy, interesting, and educational play...

_

note:  the word "pataphysics" and its being studied can be found in the Bea=
tles' song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer."--




=20




The first "official"  introduction of
'Pataphysics to the North American audience/readers may (or not) be seen as
Evergreen Review Issue 13=2C May/June 1960=2C with a spiral and the words
"What is 'Pataphysics" suspended in the =93equivalent=94 of a foto dipped
in green (=93evergreen=94) of Jarry  aboard one of his personal manias=2C  =
his beloved bicycle=2C heading down the street=2C
away from the camera=2C into that Futurity which the present is  the =93bec=
oming memory=94 of.=20



Following an Intro by Roger Shattuck=2C there's an excellent selections of =
works
from Alphonse Allais=2C Leon-Paul Fargue=2C Torma=2C Rene Clair=2C Rene Dum=
al and Felix
Feneon (a friend of Jarry's) to the then  contemporary "Satraps" of the Fre=
nch
College du 'Pataphysique" such as Vian=2C Butor=2C Queneau=2C Ionesco=2C.=20



A year later=2C reflecting on this event and its effects in North America=
=2C Asger
Jorn=2C the Danish artist=2C ground breaking investigator of Scandinavian a=
rts and
for some years Situationist=2C penned a piece for =93Internationale Situati=
onniste=94
No. 6=2C August 1961 called =94Pataphysics=97A Religion in the Making.=94

http://infopool.org.uk/6104.html

=20

Jorn writes:

It is only recently that
the religious content of Pataphysics has become apparent. Prior to this
development=2C Jarry's invention remained largely unknown beyond the small =
circle
who published the esoteric Cahiers du College de Pataphysique. But all this
changed when a special Pataphysical number of the Evergreen Review was
published in New York.



Although
the Americans have now claimed the honour of presenting Pataphysics to the
world=2C they didn't dare mention the word religion in their journal.
Nevertheless=2C the enormous success Pataphysics enjoyed last year among th=
e New World intelligentsia has inaugurated an epoch in
which the essentially religious nature of this phenomena will be carefully
analysed

=20

Recently re-reading some of Jarry=92s essays and fictions re
=91Pataphyisics=2C two things really struck me.=20
One is that Jarry=92s =91Pataphysical compilations=2C Almanachs=2C woodcuts=
=2C all
owe a great deal to the medieval period=2C and specifically to the spirit o=
f
Rabelais and Villon. In Rabelais=2C there is the mocking of both science an=
d
religion which go on unabated=2C as well as the production of a ceaselessly
teeming=2C transmuting and truly =93exceptional=94 cosmos=2C in which the s=
izes and
shapes of everything are subject to immense and swift adjustments to indeed
=93Situations.=94 Rabelais spoofs and distorts and disgorges the scientific=
 and
religious languages of his time=2C a crazy quilt =93polygut=94 of half dige=
sted Latin
and the wildly free and raucous French of the times=2C itself at the thresh=
olds
of the strangling codifications soon eno9ugh to appear. =20

    And in Rabelais=2C
as in Jarry=97let us not forget the =93exceptional=94 role that Flatulence
plays!!  The =93inflation =93 of language is
measured along side its accompaniment=2C that inflating of the human bowels=
 which
results in the production of an inflation with finds its mode of expression
via  an orifice of the human anatomy
which seeks to equal that of the mouth in volume and expressiveness.

       There are also=2C
as in Villon=2C the predilection for the machines and images of executions=
=2C with
Jarry sharing Villon=92s words almost exactly apropos hanging=2C and adding=
 himself
the modern Guillotine to the scenes of the functions of separating the body
from the head from which it itself is seen as =93hanging from=94 previous t=
o their
union being rent asunder.

         There is also
the example of Flaubert=92s Bouvard et Pecuchet=2C which presents the adven=
tures of
two copy-clerks who=2C unlike Bartleby the Scrivener=2C are able due to an
inheritance to leave their desk and purchase an immense country estate=2C w=
hich
wins them no welcome from the local inhabitants.  These two former copiers =
set about exploring
the branches of knowledge which compose the arts and sciences=2C and in alm=
ost
every case run aground on the beaches of their own persistent ignorance. =20

      On their way to
this pessimistic view of the acquisition and accumulation of knowledge=2C t=
he duo
decide to turn their heads and hands instead to compiling a =93Dictionary o=
f
Received Ideas=2C=94 collecting al the stupid quotes manifesting the
=93unexceptional=94: (in Jarry=92s terms) presented as something =93excepti=
onal=2C=94 which
provide insights in to the questions of all facets of life  These =93receiv=
ed ideas=2C=94 unquestioned and in a
sense almost invisible until compiled as an actual =93set=94 within genres =
and
categories of thought and language=2C=20
create a form of =93anti-Encyclopedia=2C =93 in which the Encyclopedic
aspirations of the 18th century are turned on their heads as
=93fauxk-wisdom=2C=94  of the kind massively
generated by the new industrialized media of the =93Age of Progress.=94=20

     A few decades
earlier=2C Baudelaire had written of his hope to produce lines which would =
become
clich=E9s.  The =93true test=94 of the poet=92s
work would be to vanish into this sea of =93received ideas=2C=94 which iron=
ically is
the very environment that would reject the poet=92s =93exceptional=94 langu=
age=2C or=2C
perhaps=2C  this vast sea might instead
engulf the poem in a vast moist embrace in which it would also vanish=2C  a=
nd become =93unrecognized=94 because
=93misunderstood=94 as the only way by which it might attain  a paradoxical=
 =93recognition=94 by becoming
=93unrecognizable=94 due to misunderstandings=2C and so=97

=20

=93Taken for something else=2C=94 continue a free and camouflaged
existence=2C unnoticed=2C unread=2C unseen=2C unknown=2C by attaching itsel=

=93overlooked=2C=94 because of course=2C things in order to be Important=2C=

=20

This is the strategy=2C after all=2C of the Viceroy butterfly=2C
which so resembles a Monarch=2C that no enemy will attack it=3B because the=
 Monarch
possesses a poison that kills those who try to eat it=2C and so acts as a =
=93deterrence=94
that the Viceroy copies in terms solely of =93appearance.=94 =20

and their objects into Theater and the discovery that =93as Metaphysic is t=
o
Physics=2C so =91Pataphysics is to Metaphysics.=94

         Ubu and =91Pataphysics are born out of a
satirizing=2C inverting=2C and  subverting of
the Institutionalized forms and formulae of =93knowledge=94 which a citizen=
 bent on
a =93career=94 is forced to undergo. Where the French College du =91Pataphy=
sique
(revived=2C after a quarter century of dormancy=2C in 2000) and its recentl=
y formed
English rough equivalent=2C equivalency being at the =93heart of the matter=
=2C=94
differ from the North American =93Pataphysics=2C=94 is=2C as Jorn foresees=
=2C its being
turned back into an Institutionalized form and formulae which take on the r=
ites
and trappings of a new form of religion.=20


      One might then
observe that  the ideas and characters
born of the immediate =93wreck-creations=94=20
and absurd  comedies of the
classroom=2C  the satires of the
=93Professor=2C=94 and of  the entire sets of
Jargons=2C discourses=2C that  have been erected
to produce both an elite and a =93common=94 mass=94 of students of the =93s=
ame mind=2C=94  of  the
same mind=2C that is=2C regarding the Seriousness of their Placements and
Advancements within the Structures of Society=92s various Institutions=3B o=
ne might
observe in this that the originary =93scene=94 of Ubu in opposition to all =
of
these=2C is turned inside out and becomes again the very site of the produc=
tion
of a conformity.=20

=20

   This is the
situation which Jorn presents:

=20

=93If Pataphysics had been taught anonymously=2C and avoided
criticism=2C it might have slipped unnoticed into the world. Had this had
happened=2C the apparently insoluble problem of Pataphysical authority - th=
e
consecration of the inconsecratable - would not have occurred. =93

=20

That is=2C if =91Pataphysics had indeed flown into the world as
the Viceroy=2C camouflaged and whose recognition was a form of misreading=
=2C
misunderstanding and hence =93unrecognizablity=2C=94 =91Pataphysics would h=
ave eluded
the confrontation with the Authorities of the Institutional =93Authorizatio=
ns=2C=94
who strip away an unrecognized anonymity=2C a camouflaged misreading
misunderstood and too obvious to notice=2C and instead set up in their abse=
nces
the presence of their own Authorships.

=20

This situation which Jorn presents is somewhat similar to
another one being written of at roughly the same time=97the situation of th=
e
=93Garden Dwarfs=94 as Hans Richter calls them in his Dada:  Art and Anti A=
rt. The =93Garden dwarfs=94 are the
neo-Dadas=2C who in a sense obey the letter but not the spirit of the Law=
=2C a Law
which did not exist until they had retrospectively =93recognized=94 its exi=
stence
and so initiated a trend that in recent years has become the falsification =
of
Dada in the US textbooks and Institutions with=20
their ensuing cult of Tzara=2C the least interesting and least Dada of
them all=2C who turned promotion of a borrowed name and movement into a one=
 man
show starring himself=2C and continued on like an animated corpse long afte=
r the
Dadas had all left=2C  finding himself finally
cornered in the company of the emerging Surrealists=97co-founding with Andr=
e
Breton the journal =93Literature=2C=94 the very anti-thesis of the Hugo Bal=
l-named
=93Dada=94-- with whom he participated in and celebrated  Dada=92s =93funer=
al.

=20

For Richter=2C Huelsenbeck and other Dadas=2C the accomplishment
of Tzara is to eradicate any of the =93Revolutionary=94 and =93street=94 el=
ements in
Dada=2C and instead produce a series of literary =93manifestos=94 which lea=
d straight
to the heart of the matter for him: =93Literature.=94

=20

(As Henry Miller put it in the =93Fourteenth Ward=94 section in
Black Spring:  =93What is not in the open
street is false=2C derived that is to say=2C literature.=94)

=20

This retrospective revisioning=2C reformulating and
re-fashioning of Dada=97and of Neo-Dada and the Garden Dwarfs - in order to=
 have
it conform better to the current situation and narrative of the poet/artist=
 in
the US=2C  Jorn recognizes also as a crisis
within =91Pataphysics:

=20

The great merit of
pataphysics is to have confirmed that there is no metaphysical justificatio=
n
for forcing everybody to believe in the same absurdity=2C possibilities for=
 the
absurd and in art are legion. The only logical deduction that can be made f=
rom
this principle is the anarchist thesis: to each his own absurdities. The
negation of this principle is expressed in the legal power of the state=2C =
which
forces all citizens to submit to an identical set of political absurdities.=
=20


It must by
now be apparent that once a Pataphysical authority is accepted=2C it become=
s a
demagogic weapon against the Pataphysical spirit

             The game is the Pataphysical
overture to the world. The realisation of such games is the creation of
situations. A crisis therefore exists=2C caused by the crucial problem whic=
h each
Pataphysical adept must resolve: s/he must apply the situlogic method and
attack the conditions of the reigning society=2C or else simply refuse to d=
o
anything whatsoever about the situation. It is in the latter resolution to =
this
problem that Pataphysics becomes the religion best adapted to life in the
society of the spectacle: a religion of passivity and pure absence

=20

This
=93religion of passivity=94 adapted to the life of the society of the spect=
acle may
be found today in the latest =93hot topics=94 of the ongoing entropy of an
Institutionalized setting=2C which for Melville=92s Bartleby was to be foun=
d on
Wall Street=2C where the Scrivener states his =93I would prefer not to=94 c=
ontinue
copying=2C and eventually finds himself in the Tombs=2C perversely observed=
 and
studied by his former employer=2C a lawyer in the service of the Market.  T=
he entropy of a =93case=94 as seemingly
=93passive=94 as Bartleby's is found in the =93conceptual works=94 which de=
dicate
themselves to =93copying=2C  data filing=2C and
boredom-=2C=94 the latter being regarded by artists from Baudelaire to the =
Dadas to
Dubuffet and beyond as the =93enemy of art.=94 Or =93the enemy of existence=
.=94=20

The religious aspect of boredom Baudelaire called =93Acedie=2C
la maladie des moines.=94

Acedia=97the malady of monks.

=20

And monks=2C to be sure=2C of some denominations=2C were known to
be =93copyists=2C=94 some of whom=2C anonymously=2C created some among the =
most beautiful
Visual Poetry and Book Art known in the West.

=20

Perhaps the situation of today=92s poets who are dependent on machines
and others=92 materials to copy or =93flarf=2C=94or =93pataphysic=94 or =93=
Ouliper=94 or =93Vizpoize=94
 or =93avant=94are spurred on by the lashes
of the command to =93publish or perish.=94

    In Enrique

need and
desire to =93appear in print=2C=94 no matter what it is or in what form.  T=
his suggests the resurrection of the last

(apologies for the non-Boog email)

Hi all,

It's my 12th consecutive season with a Mets Sunday plan (which now =20
comes with some weekdays), the first one at what they're still calling =20=

Citi Field, and I thought I'd see if any of you might be interested in =20=

buying tickets (and joining the lineup of what would make a pretty =20
swell anthology, with past buyers of my Mets tix including Jim Behrle, =20=

Rachel Levitsky, Jean-Paul Pecqueur, Nathaniel Siegel, and Angela =20
Veronica Wong).

I still have two seats, and in the new ballpark they are in the =20
Promenade Reserved Infield, sec. 512, which is behind home plate two =20
sections up the first-base line. Click the below link and when there =20
click section 512 for a view from the seats:

http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/ticketing/seating_pricing.jsp

If you're interested in buying any tickets (or know someone who is) =20
you (or they) can email me here:

editor@boogcity.com

(Note that the Mets charge different prices depending upon the =20
opponents and the date, so you'll see, for example, that the Padres=92 =20=

game, the third regular season game at Citi Field, costs more than the =20=

other games. Also, I've included a service charge of $2 per game, =20
prorated from what the Mets charge me for the 15-game package.)

Hope this finds you well (and Lets Go Mets!)

as ever,
David

e and the following Handbooks have been great for Freshman whose High Schoo=
l education did not seem to cover grammar with any kind of depth:=20

Little, Brown Handbook--H. Ramsey Fowler, Jane E. Aaron, and Janice Okoomia=
n

Simon an Schuster's Handbook for Writers edited by Lynn Quitman Troyka.=20

And for Poetics:=20

Twentieth Century American Poetics: Poets on the Art of Poetry edited by Da=
na Gioia, David Mason, and Meg Schoerke=20

The Longman Dictionary of Poetic Terms=A0 edited by Jack Myers and Michael =
Simms.=20

Troyka was my favorite, although, now that I have the important
sections (for Freshman) of Little, Brown memorized (not literally, of cours=
e), the
Little, Brown handbook has been quite useful and easy to figure out.=20

Check with those teaching Freshman English.  They usually have their own gr=

two phenomenologies of acoustic architecture, please have a listen

Monk Parakeets (Quaker Parrots) nesting at Greenwood Cemetary in Brooklyn
- three large nests at the entrance. the sound is digitally slowed-down to
reveal the interaction between digital artifacts and call structures and
details. a sense of the _space_ of the calls is clear.

http://www.alansondheim.org/quarterparrot.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org.tenthparrot.mp3

three audio pieces from a sound version of the Second Life installation,
detailing an invisible but definable virtual path among sources. something
here resonates with the classical Greek chorus and Sarah Bernardt; the
space is evocative, choratic.

Objet : Sarith Peou's "Corpse Watching" cited in Harper's Magazine, April 2009

This month's _Harper's_ features a long article on the Cambodian genocide and its aftermath by Ben Ehrenreich, namely "Cambodia's Wandering Dead: The Ghosts of Genocide Pay Penance for Western Guilt."  The article is especially brutal on  intersections between genocide and tourism in contemporary Cambodia.  Ehrenreich opens his essay with a quotation from Sarith Peou's poem, contained in his Tinfish Press chapbook of the same title:

Some corpses catch in the thickets,
Some corpses catch in the reeds,
We don't want their spirits hanging around,
So we give them the push that they need.

We reprinted Sarith's book recently, after it was a finalist for an Asian American Workshop award.  The book was designed by Lian Lederman and contains a second "book", which opens from the left, of photographs from the Cambodian Documentation Center in Phnom Penh.  I suspect that's where Ehrenreich got his copy of the book.

For more details about the book, please see

http://tinfishpress.com   under "chapbooks"

and consider purchasing one.

Many thanks to Ed Bok Lee, who wrote the book's introduction, for spotting the citation.

And please keep a tinfishpress.com bookmark on your computer to catch our offerings as they appear.

aloha, Susan

There's also Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik's  A Grammar of =
Contemporary English.  It's a linguistic compilation, descriptive not =
prescriptive.  Superbly helpful in analysis, and meanings of forms, if =
that's what you're looking for.

I am trying to find progressive, independent bookstores from anywhere in
the country that cater to teachers, such as Bank Street Bookstore in New
York and Busboys and Poets in DC. I want to find out if these bookstores
might be interested in carrying Planning to Change the World, the social
justice lesson plan book that the network co-publishes with the New York
Collective of Radical Educators.

If you can send me the name and location of your favorite bookstore, I
would be much obliged.

Thanks so much for your help!

Milwaukee is a very 'pataphysical town.

Question:  in the OuLiPo, is there a split between the Renaissance /
Baroque / Early Modern a la Ariosto, et.al. -- acrostics, cabinet
plays, wunderkammer, etc. -- and the Rabelaisian catalog, the medieval
almanack?

TWO NOVELLAS: MARBLE SNOWS & THE STUDY

by

Michael Heller

As with Michael Heller=92s memoirs and essays, Two Novellas: Marble
Snows & The Study continues his project of poetry by other means. These
works, written some twenty years apart and drawing on such diverse
influences as Akutagawa=92s short fictions, Joyce=92s Portrait and Valery=92=
s
Monsieur Teste, embody Heller=92s exploration of language=92s dramatic
relationship to character, fate and incident. Using radically different
narrative techniques, the two novellas are united by a persistent vision,
both anguished and comic, of a consciousness ransomed to words and yet,
in mysterious ways, seemingly redeemed by them.

 From previous comment on Michael Heller=92s work:

=93In the subtle resources of this articulate poet=92s testament, one voice=
 again
speaks for all.=94=ADRobert Creeley

=93He=92s somewhat a latter-day Jewish Yeats, full of terror and joy, trying=
 to
make some sense of the chaotic destructiveness of the 20th century in lyric
poetry. It is heroic if impossible task.=94=ADThe East Hampton Star

=93...a questing intelligence, forever on the trail of the epistemological,=

Artist Robert Delford Brown, dead at 78

Today at 5:26pm
by Mark Bloch

The body of 78-year-old artist Robert Delford Brown, who played a role =20=

in many of the late 20th Century's major art movements, was found the =20=

evening of March 25 in the Cape Fear River, not far from his home in =20
Wilmington, North Carolina. No foul play is suspected. The artist was =20=

reportedly contemplating a new work utilizing the river and was also a =20=

person who enjoyed taking walks in natural settings. Brown moved to =20
Wilmington from New York City two years ago in anticipation of his =20
first museum exhibition at the Cameron Art Museum.

In his final piece of artwork one month ago, Brown utilized social =20
networks to collaborate with local artists on the =93Kazooathon=94 via =20=

Wilmington=92s Independent Art Company and helped organize a performance =
=20
art parade with kazoos in downtown Wilmington.

The late Allan Kaprow, originator of the Happening movement in the =20
early 1960s, credited Robert Delford Brown with "ecstatic power" =20
saying he "threw a monkey wrench into the avant garde in those days. =20
He was (and is) a visionary you couldn't ignore or forget. Brown's =20
work is important. He touches a nerve at the core of the social codes =20=

that organize not only our behavior but also the limits of our art=85 =20=

Robert Delford Brown's transcendent vision takes on a great =20
significance.=94

Walter Hopps, the late and legendary American curator said in 2004, =20
=93There were some outrageous performances of the time. Robert Delford =20=

Brown took this to an apogee, always wonderfully worked out. He was =20
always very thorough in what he did -- not a passing gesture, =20
casually.=94 And =93those of us who have been involved with him for the =20=

most part really know and admire his work.=94

Hermann Nitsch, the Austrian founder of Vienna Aktionism, said, =93He is =
=20
one of the pioneers among the artists who have worked with the taboo =20
on meat and flesh. He has been doing so in an entirely entirely =20
radical way and with remarkable consistency since the beginning of the =20=

1960s. His work is charged with the spirit of a timeless confrontation =20=

with absurdity.=94

Indeed, it was Brown, himself, who once said of one of the Vaudeville =20=

comedians that he loved, =93Ed Wynn taught us the profound truth that =20=

being foolish was not disabling, but actually a path toward liberation =20=

and discovery." Brown lived this philosophy to the fullest, valuing =20
art and art history but embracing total freedom more than anything =20
else. Though he decided as a young man to dedicate himself to art, he =20=

jettisoned that label when it was necessary, if it got in the way. The =20=

central concept in the teachings of his self-styled religion, =20
Funkupaganism, also known as The First National Church of the =20
Exquisite Panic, Inc. is the Theory of Pharblongence. "Pharblongence" =20=

is the anglicized version of an ancient word of Yiddish origin =20
translated as "total confusion". =93It is a humorous way of reminding =20=

ourselves that the only way we have of learning is through trial and =20
error,=94 he told us.

Robert Delford Brown was born in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains =20=

during the Great Depression in Portland, Colorado. =93It was very =20
rural,=94 he said to me in a series of interviews we did in anticipation =
=20
of his upcoming Wilmington exhibition catalog. His father was employed =20=

testing cement as a chemical technician. "I was born in Central =20
Colorado in 1930. No one is more American than I am,=94 he told me in =20=

2006. Both sides of his family had been in the USA since Revolutionary =20=

times. His father, whose name was also Robert Delford Brown, was of =20
Irish, German, and Dutch stock, originally hailing from a farm in =20
Illinois. His mother=92s family were farmers from Kansas. He said that =20=

he once told his mother, =93If you join the Daughters of the American =20=

Revolution, you've lost a son.=94 Brown was born a Junior but, like the =20=

DAR pedigree, dropped it, =93I don=92t need it.=94 The family moved to =
Long =20
Beach when he was 12. =93For my benefit,=94 he added.

Soon after, Brown discovered jazz, a passion he held throughout his =20
life. =93I don=92t know how I stumbled on it. I think I found these =
books =20
in the Junior High School library. There were two books about white =20
musicians in the library, biographies of white musicians, Frank =20
Deshwacker, and Muffy Spanger, and Peewee Russell.=94 With a friend, =20
Bill Hagleheimer, Brown would attend jazz gigs in downtown Los =20
Angeles, and at more respectable places like the Los Angeles =20
Philharmonic. =93There was this place called The Lightning Room, and the =
=20
Lightning Room had a little stage about 3 feet by 3 feet and then =20
strip, the strip teaser would do this dance on this little platform. =20
And then there was a blind drummer who played the saxophone.=94 He =20
continued, =93You=92d have 50 musicians up at a jazz concert, Coleman =20=

Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Lester Young, they all showed up. And I was =20=

like 15 years old. My mother would drive me and sit outside while I =20
was in there =85a little white boy with all these black people. And the =20=

black guys=85 they=92d be passing quarts of vodka around.=94 He didn=92t =
=20
partake despite being introduced to beer at 15. He was there for the =20
music.

As a student at Long Beach State College, Brown met the painter Ed =20
Moses who had just gotten out of the service. Moses later introduced =20
him to the L.A. gallery owner Virginia Dwan, who rented him a second =20
floor apartment over the merry-go-round in Santa Monica. It kept him =20
awake, =93until 2 in the morning=85=92I=92m looking over a four leaf =
clover=92 =20
over and over again=85I lived at the Santa Monica Pier for 2 or 3 =
years.=94

Brown studied art at Long Beach College and at UCLA from 1948-1952, =20
receiving his B.A. from UCLA and his M.A. there in 1956. He studied =20
drawing with the Surrealist Howard Warshaw (1920-1977), who had been =20
given his first solo exhibition by the legendary gallerist Julian Levy =20=

in 1945. Brown worked with Warshaw from 1955, when the teacher had a =20
retrospective at the Pasadena Museum of Art, until 1958. Warshaw, =20
known for developing a unique language and philosophy of drawing, =20
infused the scientific knowledge of the day in the work that must also =20=

have appealed to the young Brown who later became a vociferous =20
disciple of Buckminster Fuller. In Warshaw=92s lines, like Brown=92s =
early =20
work, one can read the emotional tenor of the artist and subject. Also =20=

like Brown, the New York-born Organic Cubist Warshaw was a transplant =20=

to California. He had moved west in 1942 and found work in the studios =20=

of Disney and Warner Brothers. Beginning in 1951, Warshaw taught at =20
the University of California, which he continued for more than 20 =20
years completing monumental murals for several UC campuses.

Another future art world fixture that Brown met as a young man was =20
Walter Hopps who would go on to become the curator at the Pasadena =20
Museum of Art and then the Menil Collection in Houston as well as many =20=

other positions. The two met at UCLA when Hopps was on the GI Bill. =93I =
=20
thought these kids who had been in the Army, I thought they knew =20
everything. I was 17-18 years old, they were in their 20s. I thought =20
they really knew what the hell was going on,=94 Brown said. Via a =20
psychiatric clinic associated with UCLA, Brown, Moses and Hopps all =20
became male attendants to a schizophrenic young woman who Hopps =20
recalled liked to be taken to Disneyland in Anaheim. Brown continued =20
with low-paying work in the mental health area for the next few years.

In 1952 Brown had his first show in Ed Kelly=92s Frame Shop in LA. =20
Walter Hopps said in a 2004 interview, =93I was disappointed that nobody =
=20
bought anything. After the show was over, he took it all out to the =20
back yard of the place and burned it. He had been known to do this =20
with his art, and this was the first occasion that this, sadly, =20
happened.=94 (from pg. 11, Robert Delford Brown: Meat, Maps and Militant =
=20
Metaphysics, 2008, edited by Mark Bloch, published by the Cameron Art =20=

Museum.)

=93My grandmother was a control freak and my mother was a control freak =20=

and finally I got out of southern California when I was 28 years old=85. =
=20
I could not stand Southern California=94 he said. He also felt that he =20=

had been deliberately steered away from the happiness he had felt as =20
an actor in a high school theater production. =93Most parents would be =20=

thrilled that their son had some success but, whatever the reason, my =20=

parents were upset. I think my poor father told my mother, I think =20
he=92s going to be a fairy. I was a thespian. I was a thespian! I just =20=

had a hell of a good time yelling=85it was like being drunk. I was given =
=20
permission to act out. Miss Jacobson said, just go for it=85 but my =20
parents were obsessed and so after the semester and Miss Jacobson said =20=

are you going to sign up, and I said no. I had all of this success, =20
incredible success, everybody thought I was fabulous, everybody =20
thought I was funny and I just couldn=92t take my parents=92 behavior. I =
=20
was sick.=94

In 1959, Brown moved to Manhattan. =93If you aspired toward becoming an =20=

artist you had to go to New York.=94 Brown spent the next few months =20
=93walking up and down the streets of the city, visiting every gallery=94 =
=20
and =93devouring=94 every art magazine or text about art he could find.


=93The most serendipitous event in my life was my meeting with Rhett =20
Cone.=94 Brown said in 1990. =93She had founded the Cricket Theater on =20=

Second Avenue and Tenth Street where she showcased new material, =20
presented the "Merry Mimes" children's theater, and produced and =20
directed plays by such writers as Edward Albee, and Samuel Becket. For =20=

the past 27 years Rhett has been my most fervent admirer. For the past =20=

25 years she has been my wife and enthusiastic collaborator, as well =20
as co-conspirator.=94 His wife and art-partner for the next thirty =20
years, who died of lung cancer in 1978, once told an interviewer, =20
=93When I met Bob he was 29 and working in a psychiatric ward. A lot of =20=

his work comes out of that experience.=94 Brown once said, =93In 1963 I =20=

met Rhett and life got better. I was in a coffee shop and she came in =20=

and she looked hot. She=92d just been divorced." Brown said later of =20
Rhett and her two daughters, Peggy and Carol, =93We were like a little =20=

family,=94 Brown had found the support system he needed and his art =20
career as a first rate iconoclast took off shortly thereafter.

=93When I came out of school in 1950, the art world I was preparing for =20=

was gone,=94 Brown said. But in New York, he forged head first into the =20=

new art sensibilities that were developing in the late 50s and early =20
60s. Happenings, Fluxus, and Ray Johnson=92s New York Correspondence =20
School and even Pop Art had not yet been named, yet change was in the =20=

air and Brown was one of the many artists who arrived on the New York =20=

scene in those days, sensing that something dramatic was about to =20
happen. =93In retrospect, Cubism was Pop Art. The entire history of =20
modern art was Pop Art,=94 Brown once said. But as Abstract =20
Expressionism faded away, galleries and artists alike were making room =20=

for the =93Neo-Dada=94 shows as they were called in those days and the =20=

time-based, action-oriented art works emerging at the time that =20
brought art and life one step closer together than had the drip =20
paintings of Jackson Pollock.

=93I met Allan Kaprow when were in Paris on our honeymoon.=94 Brown =
said. =20
=93Rhett and I went down to this gallery. It was an incredible =20
Happening. And then I met him in New York City. And because Rhett was =20=

friendly, we kept in touch.=94 Brown often credited Rhett with being a =20=

license for him not to speak. =93She liked to talk and I didn=92t. I =20
didn=92t have to talk until Rhett died.=94

Kaprow provided the missing link for Brown=92s career that came shortly =20=

thereafter. Kaprow encouraged Brown=92s participation in his upcoming =20=

presentation of the musical play entitled "Originale" by the German =20
avant garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen to be held at Judson Hall =20
in New York City as part of Charlotte Moorman=92s =93Second Annual Avant =
=20
Garde Festival=94 in 1964. Brown elevated the intellectual affair to the =
=20
level of spectacle when he and Rhett created the memorable image of =20
"the mad painter" which was splashed across the pages of local papers =20=

and national news magazines such as Time. Brown=92s phallic spaceman =20
image had made him a standout among the likes of his contemporaries =20
Kaprow, Moorman, Allen Ginsburg, Nam June Paik, and Jackson MacLow.

Soon after, Brown created a second success d'scandale, the "Meat =20
Show", which was staged in 1964 in a large refrigerated space in New =20
York=92s Meat District near 14th street and the West Side Highway. =93We =
=20
went and rented a meat locker, telling the owner that we were making a =20=

movie and needed a set,=94 Rhett said. Brown became the first artist to =20=

stage a meat performance, renting =93tons of meat and gallons of blood=94 =
=20
and a refrigerated locker for a blood-spattered Happening. Brown had =20
taken as his palette, among other items, =93200 pounds of beef livers, =20=

50 gallon barrels of lungs, a pig, several lamb heads and 25 pounds of =20=

human hair.=94

Said Brown=92s wife, =93The trucks arrived bringing all this steaming =
hot =20
meat. We hung it everywhere on hooks. Then we got thousands of yards =20
of lingerie-like sheer fabric and created rooms as in a brothel. It =20
actually looked very erotic. The cops came in to inspect and said we =20
had to have some red lights in the back which made it even more =20
erotic.=94 In fact it was Rhett, well-versed in the ways of publicity =20=

from her days in the theatre, who had the event announced on the =20
society pages of the Daily News. Limos were pulling up for the one-=20
night Happening, creating a scene more reminiscent of an episode of =20
the =93Three Stooges=94 than an art opening. In 1964, Brown tackled =20
another taboo when he founded his most well-known and longest-lasting =20=

creation, The First National Church of the Exquisite Panic, Inc.. =20
Brown later explained, =93The idea for the creation of a church began =20=

when Allan Kaprow asked me to play the role of The Painter in =20
Karlheinz Stochausen's =91Originale=92. I wanted to do something =
visually =20
interesting. Jackson Pollock had thrown paint, Georges Mathieu had =20
dressed funny and squirted paint from tubes, and Yves Klein had =20
dragged naked women covered with paint across canvases, and had used a =20=

flame thrower to paint with fire. I decided that I would wear a =20
firefighter's suit and drop eggs and red powder from a ladder. I =20
suddenly realized that I was coming up with a creation myth that had =20
similarly occurred to people for millions of years."

Brown incorporated his =93charismatically inclined, transcendental, =20
humorist=94 church which included a cross-eyed smiley face deity called =20=

=93Who Knows?=94 (As in, Why is it not raining? Who Knows?) And like any =
=20
other religion, prohibitions. Well at least one: Brown said in many a =20=

performance or speech to an inquiry or simply anyone that would =20
listen, =93Our one prohibition is DO NOT EAT CARS.=94 And adding, =93There=
 =20
is only one commandment: LIVE! After all, this is the one fundamental =20=

irreducible requisite for (in his trademark capital letters) LIFE.=94 He =
=20
also teaches that there are FOUR WAYS: THE RIGHT WAY, THE WRONG WAY, =20
THE OTHER WAY, AND THE SOUFFLE. And finally, in his most oft-quoted =20
tenet, =93Many religions teach how to get to Nirvana. They all give very =
=20
complicated directions. The First National Church of the Exquisite =20
Panic, Inc. tells you how to get to NEVADA. It sounds close, and it=92s =20=

simple: YOU TAKE A BUS!=94

This resulted in the =93Maps to Nevada,=94 a series of drawing, painting =
=20
and calligraphy work on canvas, fine paper and occasionally even rugs =20=

or travel maps that stretched across several decades of work and =20
incorporated the Matta- or Tanguy-esque drafting style he honed as a =20
young man under the direction of Warshaw.

In 1967, Rhett and Robert Brown discovered the Jackson Square Branch =20
library building that was up for sale in the heart of Greenwich =20
Village. They immediately created a physical headquarters of the =20
Church they founded in 1964. They moved from Rhett=92s home at King=92s =20=

Point in Great Neck, Long Island, to the building on West 13th Street, =20=

where Horatio, Greenwich Avenue and 8th Street meet, dubbed by Brown =20
as =93The Great Building Crack-Up.=94 Large ceremonial plaques soon =20
adorned a courtyard fenced in by iron with large, cross-eyed metal =20
sculptures flanking the entrance way of the distinctive three-story =20
(plus two basements) building. The plaques explained that the =20
=93Crackup=94 was a collision between two architects and two centuries: =20=

one, the 19th century=92s William Morris Hunt who built the regal =20
structure and also designed the base of the Statue of Liberty and =20
parts of the Metropolitan Museum; and the other, the 20th century=92s =20=

Paul Rudolf whose buildings at Yale in the 1960s earned him a =20
reputation as an important Modernist. Brown bought in the latter to =20
completely transform the building inside and out. Brown called the =20
architectural landmark an =93architectural improvisation=94 and =
=93doodling =20
with architecture=94 and for the next three decades it provided a home =20=

for Brown and his family, his Church, and dozens of unorthodox art =20
exhibitions, collaborations, gatherings and performances which he =20
called Grand Opening Performances.

Brown and Rhett were hailed as one of the first =93artist couples=94 of =20=

the 1960s. Christo and Jean-Claude followed them as did the Claus =20
Oldenburgs and others that Brown and Rhett knew. Bob and Rhett were a =20=

fixture around town, known as =93The Bobsy Twins=94 as they were friends =
=20
with or performed with most of the Happenings and Fluxus-linked =20
artists of the day including Kaprow, Oldenburg, Wolf Vostell, Jim Dine =20=

and Carolee Schneeman.

Brown continued to perform throughout the next four decades. He =20
created =93events=94 in Los Angeles and Nice. He sported pink hair =
decades =20
before it was fashionable, getting arrested and causing a scandal in =20
London in the Sixties. He also, according to his Meat, Maps and =20
Militant Metaphysics catalog, first suggested Charlotte Moorman might =20=

remove her clothes and that Yoko Ono try a visit to London in 1966 to =20=

increase her chances of fame and fortune. Whether or not these =20
reminiscences are true, no one would deny that Brown was often ahead =20
of his time.

Brown is also cited not only as a precursor to meat-artists like =20
Nitsch, Joseph Beuys and Damien Hirst, but he is also said to have =20
anticipated the =93appropriation=94 movement with his books =93Hanging=94 =
and =20
=93Ulysses=94 and artists like Joel-Peter Witkin or others who create =20=

blurry and/or gruesome photographs decades later with books like his =20
=93First Class Portraits.=94 Brown said, "In 1965 there was a big to-do =20=

over pornography. I found illegal fetish photographs from a set of =20
German text books on sexual perversions which a psychoanalyst had to =20
import for me. I had these postage stamp size reproductions enlarged =20
to life size at Modernage photo studios. In order to get this done, I =20=

had to have a letter from Lawrence Alloway, who was then a curator at =20=

the Guggenheim Museum, stating that I was a legitimate artist and that =20=

my motives were serious. To color them I used Marshall's tinting oils =20=

which at that time were considered to be a totally obsolete technique. =20=

When I showed them to fellow artists the response was silence. A few =20
years later everyone rediscovered tinting, but the subject matter =20
never caught on." But that was before the =93post-punk=94 1980s and =20
skateboard culture of the last two decades during which Brown=92s work =20=

enjoyed increasing appreciation from a younger non-art-oriented crowd.

Perhaps Brown=92s prescience during the 60s and 70s became his undoing. =20=

He broke with a lifetime love of alcohol in 1978. =93I fell into an =20
alcoholic trance with my first bottle of beer at the age of fifteen,=94 =20=

he said in 2006. =93Fifteen year old boys are insane to begin with, and =20=

I kissed a girl. I smoked a cigarette and inhaling it was like =20
swallowing a hot rock. There was no reason in the world why anybody =20
would do anything like that.=94 But Brown was off to the races. Even =20
demolishing a car didn=92t stop him as young man and so he continued =20
drinking for the next 30 years. But in the late 70s, Brown found his =20
way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and soon gave up alcohol and =20
drugs. =93It saved my life. I found it at 48. These kids that are coming =
=20
in at 15 and 16 - it saves a lot of demolished causes. Everyone has a =20=

voice, everyone has a story. We share our experience, strength and =20
hope. AA functions. It actually functions.=94

One of the original Fluxus artists, Alison Knowles once called him "a =20=

wonderful artist friend. I liked him very much. Robert Delford Brown =20
was always totally clothed in joy, along with additives like dope and =20=

alcohol and money."

In recent years Brown parlayed the cooperative spirit of the recovery =20=

=93movement=94 into his art work. =93People Helping People is the =
Future=94 =20
emblazoned his collages and paintings of the last decade. He also =20
transformed the familiar cross-eyed =93Who Knows?=94 face-as-logo from =
the =20
early days of his church into a forward looking one that said =93What =20=

Great Art!=94 Brown spoke positively about the future but also railed =20=

against recent political events during the Bush years, increasingly =20
making a vision of a world without a need for politics and =20
environmentalism the goal and subject matter of his work. His website =20=

homepage decrees, =93The empowerment of the individual is progressing =20=

inexorably. Billions of people will demand an end to war. Billions of =20=

people will demand an end to poverty.=94

He was delighted by Obama=92s recent election while remaining skeptical =20=

and cautious. But he remained an optimist to the end, always believing =20=

that a =93total and complete global transformation=94 was coming. In the =
=20
1990s he sold his beloved Great Building Crackup, saying that, =20
=93because of cyberspace, real estate is dead now.=94 A few years later =
he =20
got rid of his television set and began to get all his news from =20
alternative sources on the Internet. In 1997, he moved to Houston, =20
Texas and began work on The Great CyberBuilding Crack-Up on Appaloosa =20=

Acres, which he called =93a Virtual Reality architectural =
improvisation.=94

Despite his love of collaboration, Brown always took his cues not from =20=

art history but from comedians, scientists, and history=92s ne=92er do =20=

wells, and this failure to conform made him a natural for the Do-It-=20
Yourself movement and difficult for gallerists to deal with, even =20
after his three decade liberation from alcohol addiction. In the early =20=

1980s, Brown was briefly associated with the Phyllis Kind Gallery in =20
Chicago and Soho and he has enjoyed continued support from Archivio =20
Francesco Conz in Verona, Italy. However, since the early 1990s, the =20
early entrant to cyberspace had done much of his work online via the =20
=93Church=94 website, Funkup.com, a twisted acronym of the First =
National =20
Church of the Exquisite Panic, Inc.

His physical collaboration of choice the past few years, during the =20
period in which he sold and moved out of the Great Building Crackup in =20=

favor of brief sojourns between New York and San Francisco, Houston =20
and most recently Wilmington, is the =93Collaborative Action Gluing=94 =20=

where by email and telephone, he arranges for a space and a =20
participative audience of non-artists. This can be in another city or =20=

another country, at a gallery, nightclub or school. He then showed up, =20=

armed with glue, scissors, rubber gloves, colored paper, magazines to =20=

cut up and several canvases for the participants to embellish =20
collectively with their unschooled musings, each eventually =20
transformed from a day-glo tabula rasa into a vibrant, swirling =20
testimony to the power of joint action by non-artists, yet at the same =20=

time, surprisingly reminiscent of the likes of Miro, Kandinsky and of =20=

course, Matisse=92s cutouts.

In 2008, Robert Delford Brown was the subject of his first major =20
Museum show at the Cameron Art Museum, Robert Delford Brown: Meat, =20
Maps and Militant Metaphysics, where director Deborah Velders and I =20
put together an exhibition of over one hundred of his works that =20
spanned from the 1950s to the present. "He was intense about his art, =20=

and he was intense about the world. He was intense about life," =20
Velders told a local reporter about Brown when word that his huge, =20
hearty and memorable laugh would no longer be heard around =20
Wilmington=92s shocked but vibrant art community.

Brown=92s work appeared in hundreds of exhibitions and publications over =
=20
the years. He is represented in the collections of (partial list): The =20=

Museum of Modern Art, New York City; Smithsonian Institution, =20
Washington D.C.; Denver Art Museum, Denver, Colorado.

He leaves a step-daughter Carol Cone.

David,

So pataphysics is the anti-matter of writing, as you have said in many
occasions, "the purloined writing." Then, pataphysicis becomes a zero
writing, undermining constantly its own authority, declaring its
"helplessness."

Here is a version of pataphysics perhaps:


My friend Sabri
And I always talk
In the street at night
And always drunk.
He always says,
"I'm late for home,"
And always two loaves
Of bread under his arm. (Orhan Veli, "the hopelessly obscure or obscene and
overlooked author")



                     Bird and Cloud

Birdman!
We have a bird
A tree
Give me a nickel's
Worth of clouds.


                        To Keep Busy

The beautiful women thought
The love poems I wrote
Were about them,
And I always suffered
Knowing that I wrote them
To keep busy.

Two weeks ago I was watching Herzog's *Encounters at the End of the World*,
his documentary about the South Pole. The film ends, or almost ends, by a
South Pole scientist's monologue about his frustrations with seeing
neutrinos, "billions, many billions of which run through his nose every
second," while preparing to send a heliom balloon into the stratosphere to
hoping capture one of these neutrinos an instant in a flash light "about te=
n
meters long." Maybe, the pataphysicist as a neutrino chaser... after a drea=
m
of strings.

Ciao,

Murat

JEROME ROTHENBERG and JEFFREY ROBINSON, with MARY ANN CAWS, MAUREEN =20
McLANE, and RICHARD SIEBURTH

The CUNY Graduatte Center Poetics Group is very excited to announce =20
that the editors of Poems for the Millennium Volume Three: The =20
University of California Book of Romantic & Postromantic Poetry will =20
be with us to read from and discuss their new anthology. Like its two =20=

twentieth-century predecessors, Poems for the Millennium, volumes 1 =20
and 2, this gathering sets forth a globally decentered approach to =20
the poetry of the preceding century from a radically experimental and =20=

visionary perspective.  The range of volume three and its skewing of =20
the traditional canon illuminate the process by which romantics and =20
post-romantics challenged nineteenth-century orthodoxies and =20
propelled poetry to the experiments of a later modernism and avant-=20
gardism.  Joining Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson in the =20
open discussion that follows the reading are three distinguished =20
scholars and translators, Mary Ann Caws, Maureen McLane, and Richard =20
Sieburth.  =93Rothenberg and Robinson have dedicated this project to an =20=

intensification and expansion of the vital and vivacious contexts of =20
the ongoing project of human thought. They present us not with the =20
fixity of a canon but with the unfixity of our world.=94 =97 Lyn =

Siglio is pleased to announce the publication of
SEVERAL GRAVITIES by Keith Waldrop
edited with an essay by Robert Seydel


SEVERAL GRAVITIES

For nearly four decades, Keith Waldrop has been creating a body of
visual art that---while mirroring his extraordinary and
internationally acclaimed oeuvre of poetry, fiction and translation---
has lived largely outside the public eye. SEVERAL GRAVITIES, this
first collection of Waldrop's radiant visual collages not only
reveals an essential facet of his extraordinary oeuvre, but also
summons a mesmerizing world in which the invisible and the absent are
roused and rise to the surface. Like his collage poems, the images
are enveloped in ghosted impressions, quiet tensions, strands of
memory and fragments of dream.

SEVERAL GRAVITIES (casebound, 112 pages, color illus. $39.50)
features a substantial selection of collages as well as a new
unpublished serial poem and an essay by Waldrop that enunciates the
relationship between his distinctive visual and poetic practices.
Editor Robert Seydel contributes an incisive essay on Waldrop's
work---its expression of the poet-artist "tradition," and its
expansion of the collage form.

For a slide show of images and more about the book, go to SEVERAL
GRAVITIES.

KEITH WALDROP is the author of over two dozen works of poetry and
prose, an eminent translator, and with wife Rosmarie the founding
editor of the influential and innovative Burning Deck Press.
Publishers Weekly has said: "Waldrop, not as well-known as he should
be, is among the most important writers, translators, and publishers
of avant-garde literature in our time." See KEITH WALDROP'S BIOGRAPHY.

Aside from Busboys & poets, google Politics & Prose, another excellent D.C. bookstore. In fact, it's more of a bookstore than Busboys/poets. I'd send you the address but I'm about to be signed off of the library computer.

Hey you all, friends, poets, loved ones,

I'm very proud to say that my visual poem "Doel 3" (written for the
Doeldichter contest) was accepted for publication in Canada on the website
www.NationalPoetryMonth.ca <http://www.nationalpoetrymonth.ca/>
You can read "Doel 3" on April 20th the web. But do not wait for that: a
poem a day keeps the sadness away!
Have fun reading through the whole month of April!

A huge hug and hope to read/hear/see you soon.

Philip

AngelHousePress presents NationalPoetryMonth.ca, a celebration of the
nation of poetry.

Each day during the month of April, a new poem will be published on the site.

Poetry is a land of risk, play, meditation, provocation and delight.
It cannot be contained within borders and should not be restricted by
boundaries of any kind.

Through the month of April, you will find poems that explore
boundaries and break through barriers: narrative, lyrical, visual, sound.

The writers of these poems come from the United Kingdom, Europe,
Canada and the United States.

This is only the first year of an annual project that will include
varieties of poetry from all over the world.

Ideally the poems will inspire more poetry, will serve to continue
the conversation that poetry creates, a conversation that is not
limited by time, place, form, age, gender, sexual orientation,
political orientation, religion or financial constraints.

The site is free and all of the poets have graciously given their
poems without payment in any type of currency except your reading pleasure.

Please visit www.nationalpoetrymonth.ca each day in April.

The  League of Canadian Poets celebrates the month with readings
across Canada and a daily poetry site:
http://lcpnationalpoetrymonth2009.wordpress.com/

Let's celebrate poetry together.
