The word "disease" gets flaunted about with the same kind of damage with
which Nick associates the use of the word "addiction." Bipolar folks, for
example, are often referred to as suffering from a 'disease.' As - in the
literature of 12 step programs - whether Alcoholics, Debtors, etc. - the
word 'disease' is frequently applied as if the person is suffering from a
permanent illness that can only be relieved by x, y and z steps - but never
fully cured.

Some professional thinking, however - particular with Bipolar sufferers -
has now changed from using the word "disease" to the word "condition" - as
in something that is treatable - in the case of being "bi-polar"  - with
appropriate, well chosen drugs. For the sufferer, the word "condition" - it
is now thought - carries a treatable connotation and, as a word, is less
likely to engage the patient with the sense of a terrible "disease" under
which one is yoked - as with an infernal, endless curse - and with all the
self-hating ramifications and loss of self-esteem of which Nick describes so
well.

With the exception of those who - for whatever reason - have decided to take
a non-returnable trip to hell and death, it's seems preferable to accept
most "addictions" instead as "conditions" - as in "he/she is suffering from
a (drug, alchohol, etc.) condition."  Certainly de-romanticizes the high or
low flying appeal of "addiction."

Why are we talking about this issue on the near eve of President Bush's
survival or fall from his "condition"?

Nice to hear from you, Murat. It's been a long time since we've
had an exchange on the poetics list!

I gave an example of an former addict that I know, a heroin addict.
I was thinking at that point of an anecdotal example of addiction
and gave an example of someone who spoke to me about
the experience.  I wasn't thinking of "negative" (judgmental) connotations
of the word in the example I gave. I was thinking more of a diagnostic or
descriptive connotation for the word. On the contrary. I was
trying to go at the issue in a different way: showing the
problem, for the addicted person, in becoming overly concerned with thinkin=
g
too much about meanings, getting overly focused on the concept of
"addiction."=20

Then I went a step further and speculated on some issues in the internal an=
d
external use of words in dealing with psychological problems with habits in
general- using addiction as a model (thinking of the word strictly in a
pragmatic, diagnostic, or descriptive sense.) I was thinking that when a
person is held back from taking action, due to ambivalence, that the
everyday negative connotations
of a word like "addiction" could lead to a secondary "addiction"
due to loss of self-esteem resulting from  the implication of the idea of
being an "addict." I was thinking that people now might use the word
"addiction" perhaps to try to frighten themselves or  support someone else
to get away from some destructive habit, some obsessive-compulsive issue.
This might be slightly helpful in very mild cases of compulsivity or in a
very early stage; but probably not of much use in deeply rooted situations.

As for labor, there are many completely drug addicted people who
work. I don't think using the relationship with work is necessarily a
helpful slant in understanding people who experience the more extreme
obsessive-compulsive issues such as addictions; think of "workoholics" for
example.

Anyway, these days "obsessive-compulsive" in everyday use has become
a compliment, as in "Time Out" magazine- that describes itself as an
"obsessive" guide to "impulsive" entertainment.

best wishes,
Nick

Someone once told me that an addiction is something where you know you
shouldn't have it but you can't get enough. Nicotine, heroin, caffeine
apply. Love, life, food, do not. Words maybe. I'm not sure the =
definition
works in all cases, but it's pretty strong. It also tells us the =
difference
between being in love (you want it, simply), say, and being co-dependent
(you want it but know you shouldn't). But now I'm getting into
pop-psychology terms, and I don't really want to do that.

You would have loved meeting the Tzara authority, Vasile Robciuc, who lived & breathed T
Tzara even
tho there was very little every day application to Dadaist ideas.

What is most remarkable here, is that everyone seems to know of Tzara, sort of a cult of
personality
thing, without having the slightest idea of his actual work.  We were watching national TV
& during a
generic comedy show, the deadpan comic/host told a joke about Tzara which everyone in the
audience
seemed to understand since they all laughed in the appropriate places.   Hard to imagine
American TV
making passing references to avant garde literature.

Of course it's a laughing matter, me dear haggis, or rather, the whole issue of monarchy is so appalling you have to laugh else
you'd cry, or shd I say 'one' has to etc? Being English I have the joy of being associated with a nasty class system I abhor while
at the same time being relegated to inferior status within that system (as a Brummie-cum-Leicesterite-of Nottingham descent, c'est
moi, a person with an accent that is despised as much as Glaswegian who lives among the chizzits while being descended from the
Sherwood tribe, that's as in the forest, me ducks). Even my girlfriend's called Victoria, as you know, I can't escape the bloody
system's inheritance (her initials are VR can you believe it?).

As you are a Midlander by proxy of residence it's about time you learnt some local geography (grin). I'll happily guide you through
the OS maps!!!!

This is not (as dave the Brummie illiterate implies) a laughing matter.

Leave aside one's prejudices against the Stuart Dynasty, the *proper* way of
referring to the drooling nincumpoop who crossed the border in 1603 and
promptly Towered Walter Ralegh for a bad pun is "James the Sixth and First"
...

[Pedantically, and as an afterthought, technically it was Jimmy who made the
pun -- "I hae heard somewhat rawly of you" -- but given that Walter Ralegh
was wandering around the corridors of Westminster while Elizabeth was dying
("She was a lady whom time surprised") muttering that even a republic would
be better than to have that Scots bampot on the throne, I suppose you can't
really blame Jimmy for slapping him in the Tower and then later selling him
out to the Spaniards.]

(He was the sixth king called James to reign in Scotland, only two of whom
died in their beds and James IV actually wrote quite a decent poem -- The
Kingis Quair -- before he inspected a canon [cannon?] which hadn't been
beta-tested and got blown to buggery.)

... not James I (though he was the first James to reign in England) nor
James I and IV (since he was Jimmy the Six in Scotland *well* before he
skipped south.

Strictly speaking (and even I'm nae sae pedantic as to insist on this) Our
Current Beloved Monarch is Elizabeth the First [of Britain] and Second [of
England].

As I say, no a laffin matter ...

        ... When Alexander our king was dead ...

                Come back Sandy, all is forgiven.

I won't go on to point-out that the two high heid yins of the so-called
"Labour" party -- Brown and Blair -- are both Scottish, as is Charles
Kennedy, leader of the Lib Dems.

If you factor-in the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael
something-of-the-night Howard, who is the Jewish son of a Polish refugee,
you begin to wonder whether Britain can actually field a single True-Born
Englishman.

(Bit like football, eh?  I mean *proper* football, whit youz yins in the
States wid caw "soccer", but.)

Oh, sorry, I forgot about UKIP (hey, Britain is now a four-party state --
come on proportional representation, all is forgiven), Robert Kilroy Silk.

A big cigar to anyone who can name the *official* leader of UKIP (the United
Kingdom Independence Party, a right bunch of wankers and chancers) -- even I
can't, and I live here.

And as the final cherry on the pudding, one of the few things that dave and
I agree on, is that the worst thing to happen to British politics was that
John Smith snuffed it.

And he was Scottish too.

I have no idea if this can be of any use, but drawing for me is like
jogging or any other activity. I repeatedly started drawing and then
quit, so I know the feeling every time. You find out that you can't
even hold a pencil in your hand! But if you were good once, it soon
comes back, if you stay there for a year, you'll be marveled at what
you can reach,

best, Anny

WORKSHOPS

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff
Feature Writing: November 13, 12 p.m. - 4 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Feature articles entertain and inform, often covering an interesting angle
of a straight news story. This course covers the who, what, where, when, why
and how of writing and selling different types of magazine and newspaper
features, plus how to approach editors.

The Art of Transformation
Instructors:  Jimmie Gilliam and Laurie Dean Torrell
3 Tuesdays, 11/16, 11/23, and 11/30 from 6:30-8:30
In The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo
$90, $75 for members

Transformations offer an opportunity to enlarge imagination and expand the
sense of what is possible in both life and artistic work. Beginning again -
suspending judgement, re-framing the familiar, being willing to change
direction - these artistic practices can be employed to navigate times of
change, and can be used to create new work.  In this workshop we will mine
experience, and use the texts The Art of Possibility: Transforming
Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander,
and Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go by Shaun McNiff.
Through discussion and writing exercises we will explore the subject of
transformation.  Participants will have the opportunity to create and share
original essays and poems, and within the three-week period, receive
individual critique if desired.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Sown Out of Season

Basking in an Autumn sun
on a bench in the park
I'm puzzled, for there
in the rocks on the pond's bank
a little clump of corn
sprouts green and dying.

The pond is spring fed
enlarged by the park founders.
Its banks were recently fortified
with truckloads of large white stones.
I'm from out-of-state and
twice chose this village as home.

A solitary duck
swims in the pond.
A woman who loves animals
placed him in this new home.
A man from another place
often stops to leave parched corn,

to feed the duck and other birds
and the greedy squirrels
who don't need to be fed.
They were born here with
plenty of hickory and oak trees.
Some were planted here too.

No squirrels or duck ate that seed
on the rocky bank and
I don't know if
anyone else has noticed
my little clump of corn sprouts
in front of my park bench.

They're only 10 inches high
grown from Spring corn seed
scattered so late in the summer.
That corn had no reason
to grow out of season
for me to wonder about.

The duck flies to visit
neighboring ponds and returns.
We both wander in our free exile.
Home is a place and
a choosing and people
simply never sow out of time.

Friday, November 5, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.
Small Press Traffic presents a reading by
Rob Halpern & Mark McMorris

Rob Halpern joins us in celebration of his debut book, Rumored Place, which
Camille Roy says "commits itself to a lyric interrogation of power. The
abjection of lyric is brought to bear as critique in a sensationalism of pure
intelligence... the result is a work for our moment: exhilarating, and edged
with grief." Mark McMorris' books include Moth-Wings, The Black Reeds, and the
just released The Blaze of Poui, of which the Voice Literary Supplement says
"Poetic equilibrium of this order is a rare thing when managing such charged
material, but in a young poet it is cause for small amazement." McMorris joins
us from Washington, DC, where he teaches at Georgetown University.


& coming up
Guy Bennett & Stacy Doris 11/12
Geoffrey Dyer & Eileen Tabios 11/19


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT
members, and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &

Dear Nick,

I think we are somewhat looking at the issue at cross purposes, reflecting our different takes on poetry, specifically, the function of language. For me, .the oncern is not therapeutic -and, in my sense, every addiction is not a negative, a defect.

Let me be specific, in relation language. In our culture, the acceptable, productive function of language is communication; in its ideal efficient use, completely transparent (frictionless).To the extent that poetry uses language in excess of communication, uselessly, it slows down, thwarts, communication. What makes an action addictive or language useless is not its content (the nature of the action or what is said), but excess. In the 1920, taking cocaine was not considered addictive behavior (think of Cole's Porter's "You're the top -better than cellophane or cocaine"). Excessive use turns language from a medium of communication to a translucent object of desire.

In other words uselessness/poetry has little do do with sickness. It is a peculiar kind of subversive play, "but in our room of the toys, dreams are shaking off/anxiously their dust ("souljam").

In another occasion, I described poetry as the addictive use of words. I was not referring to anything psychological. I was referring to poetry's subversive place in the cycle of production.

Ciao.

Murat

I am writing this letter to encourage you not to vote. This is a call to
inaction:

Every vote has as its aim a self-defense. Your vote is a source of
danger to everyone else and so calls on them to vote also. This naked
aggression against each other is madness.

To deliver yourself from unjust authorities (ie. a Bush plutocratic
oil-junta) you somehow believe your position is improved by electing and
yielding obedience to another ruling authority (ie. a Kerry
socio-regulatory bureaucracy), yet -- obviously -- all that results is
continued power in the hands of authority and therefore continued
oppression. Don't let them fool you. Instead, humble yourself, and
simply desire your part to do nothing (against another).

But if I do not vote, you might say, others will still be voting -- and
then I am left with a governing power I had no part in. Indeed. Let them
govern. Endure them with patience and without opposition. (Just like
Saddam Hussein, you'll have lots of free time to write poetry!) Free
yourself first! And then by your example show the world how to be free
from all external power.


Why is it every four years we must submit ourselves to the unnecessary
and fruitless agony of campaign elections? Why are we always trying to
settle the score? Are we the Hatfields and McCoys? Why not stress
commonality in the face of conflict by abandoning every manner of
campaign and election?

What is this strange misconception of freedom as something 'prescribed'
from external authority? Do you believe that voting for a political
party or endorsing legislation can somehow make us 'more free'? The very
condition of submission is contrary to all freedoms. For instance, what
kind of animal imagines itself free in a fenced-in place? Are you not
more intelligent?

Diversity cannot be defined in advance, po-listers!  Your lust to impose
power (by electing officials) is a genuine negative act. When you vote,
clearly you vote for your own reward (to gain) which is an aggression
against everyone else. You enact tyranny! Why vote at the expense of
everyone's prosperity?!

Advocates of slavery! Put an end to the conflict of one section of the
populace making it a duty to submit to what is prescribed to them by
another section of the populace. Are we really that dumb? Are you ready
to submit to 4 more years of Bush? Are Bush supporters willing to submit
to 4 years of Kerry or Nader? Why prescribe anything to which anyone
must submit?? It is a fallacy to believe there can exist in our modern
day and age any institution, special interest, or single person supposed
to represent every interest in society. How can you believe in the
'construction of society'? Your act of voting is nothing more than a
submission to and a preference for despotism.

It should be absolutely obvious that there is, and can be, no external
definition of anything which should be binding upon all. *What is
pro-choice?* Why do you constantly feel you have to secure your
position? Why have you chosen (through your vote) to become passive
instruments for the binding of others?

Why do you abandon the attainment of your personal goals (supporting
Kerry/Nader/Bush and not yourself)? Why do you support the 'interests'
of society? Why do you assent to strengthen one's own state of
subjection? Why have you trained yourselves to act in unison in
submission to another's will (ie. vote for me!)?

The idea that the activity of voting is some kind of 'sacred power' --
that without this activity terrible things will happen to you
('pre-emptive strike' philosophy) must be abandoned. Patriotism is a
savage superstition: an aggrandizement to act with violence. Please
remove yourself from this clandestine routine (behind the curtain) of
intimidation and oppression. When will you stop supporting your own
subordination and the subordination of others?!
Stop voting! Stop the vote!

Stop using aggression as a means of settling disputes (ie. my number of
votes outnumber your number of votes, my blog has more visitors, my
published poems and books outnumber yours)! Imagine if there was a war
and nobody showed up? Ignore the consumerist-fallacy that we've already
paid a month's rent on the battlefield!! Likewise imagine if there was
an election and nobody voted. Stop behaving like senseless machines!
Stop playing the roles of lambs-to-the-slaughter! Stop making laws
binding on all (and building up police states to enforce them by
forcible means...)! Stop supporting this positive insanity and gross
barbarity!
Don't vote!

Subject:      The Deer, by Wendy Burke (Finishing Line Press)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Finishing Line Press announces the publication of The Deer, a chapbook of
poems by Wendy Burk

Strange transformations abound in this new collection of poetry, in which
myth, muscle, and metal not only coexist, but also merge.  Alchemical in
nature, yet rooted firmly to earth, The Deer leads the reader to wilderness
in the most unlikely places: a wilderness physical and mental, seen by human
eyes but not in human terms alone.

About this book, poet Jane Miller has written: “It is a wonder to see lyric
poetry do the work of philosophy and music.  The ground under our
assumptions is loosened by these poems. And this is the very frightening
place from which they start…  Unexpected juxtapositions occur in Wendy
Burk’s lines naturally; in fact, the lines become about nature and,
ultimately, our own natures.”

Wendy Burk has twice been named Artist-in-Residence with the National Park
Service (2001, Isle Royale National Park; 2003, Buffalo National River).
Together with poet Eric Magrane, she is at work on a collaborative book
based on these residencies.  Her first book of translations, While Light is
Built, was published in 2004 by Kore Press.  Her poems have been published
in journals such as Nimrod, Slipstream, EOAGH: A Journal of the Arts,
poemmemoirstory, and Freshwater.

Finishing Line Press is a poetry publisher based in Georgetown, Kentucky.
In addition to the Chapbook Series, it publishes the New Women’s Voices
Series and sponsors the Finishing Line Open Chapbook Competition.  Other
recent Finishing Line Press releases include Scared Money Never Wins, by
Julia Wendell, and Galileo’s House, by James Scruton.

Publication Date: November 2004

ISBN: 1-932755-60-8

The Deer is a 6” x 9” soft-cover chapbook.  Retail price is $12 and includes
free shipping for all orders placed before October 26, 2004.

It seems frightening to most that the Republican watchdogs who have
been reminding us ad nauseum that they are defending our security are
also the very same people responsible for the inept failure that has
prolonged this nation's battle with Muslim extremists like Osama Bin
Laden. How Republicans can point to Bin Laden's latest video as proof
we need another four years of George W. Bush is mystifying at best. The
Bush Administration failed to find Bin Laden then declared war on a
country that had nothing to do with the horror of September 11. That
this last statement is still debatable to some points to the greater
problem that may put Bush right back in the White House. No one
anywhere is relying on facts to make the decisions that threaten all
our lives. The Bush coterie based their decisions on faulty
intelligence (remember Colin Powell holding up satellite images when he
spoke before the UN?), the American people are picking and choosing
information without bothering to do the research necessary to making an
informed decision, and Muslim extremist leaders are spewing their own
skewed mantras of hate in an attempt to gain the future following that
will perpetuate their war against the West. Nowhere is rational
discourse to be found and few are interested in any information that
doesn't support their preconceived notions. In fact most seem to harbor
a real fear of discovering the truth and therefore make a conscious
effort to avoid it. The bipartisan unity that resulted from the attack
on the WTC has long disappeared and has been replaced by pathetic
trickery and deception.

November 2 will be the day America decides whether democracy is
worthwhile. Ignorance wins.

The number of Aboriginals imprisoned continues to grow while it drops

Aboriginal people continue to be over-represented in Canada’s prison
population. It is getting worse, not better.

A new report on *Adult Correctional Services in Canada, says Aboriginal
over-representation in provincial/territorial custody continues to rise.
In 2002/03, Aboriginal people accounted for 21 percent of admissions to
sentenced provincial or territorial custody, up from a low of 15 percent
in 1997/98. In contrast, they represented only 3 percent of the total
Canadian population in 2001.

Aboriginal people also accounted for 18 per cent of federal custody
admissions, 14 percent of probation intakes and 17 percent of
conditional sentence admissions.

While the number of Aboriginal people being jailed is rising, the report
from Statistics Canada says the opposite trend is seen for the general
population.

"The adult incarceration rate, including federal, provincial and
territorial inmates, has generally been falling since it peaked in
1994/95. On an average day in 2002/03, Canada had 134 adults in custody
for every 100,000 adults in the population.

Canada’s total incarceration rate-including both adults and young
people-has been declining since the early 1990s in conjunction with the
decreasing crime rate".

It is obvious justice reform isn't moving quickly enough to divert more
Aboriginals from jails and prisons, by way of alternative sentencing etc.

There are numerous recommendations that would help in addressing the
over-representation of our people as inmates.

For example, read the final report of the Commission on First Nations
and Métis Peoples and Justice Reform . . .

Bruce Cockburn’s been in my head lately:

“Call It Democracy” (1985)


Padded with power here they come
International loan sharks backed by the guns
Of market hungry military profiteers
Whose word is a swamp and whose brow is smeared
With the blood of the poor

Who rob life of its quality
Who render rage a necessity
By turning countries into labour camps
Modern slavers in drag as champions of freedom

Sinister cynical instrument
Who makes the gun into a sacrament --
The only response to the deification
Of tyranny by so-called "developed" nations'
Idolatry of ideology

North South East West
Kill the best and buy the rest
It's just spend a buck to make a buck
You don't really give a flying fuck
About the people in misery

IMF dirty MF
Takes away everything it can get
Always making certain that there's one thing left
Keep them on the hook with insupportable debt

See the paid-off local bottom feeders
Passing themselves off as leaders
Kiss the ladies shake hands with the fellows
Open for business like a cheap bordello

And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy

See the loaded eyes of the children too
Trying to make the best of it the way kids do
One day you're going to rise from your habitual feast
To find yourself staring down the throat of the beast
They call the revolution

IMF dirty MF
Takes away everything it can get
Always making certain that there's one thing left
Keep them on the hook with insupportable debt


Comments by Bruce:



"That song came from the time of neo-conservatism,
when governments supported business at the cost of
lives and nobody gave a shit. We have since moved on
to neo-liberalism, when governments support business
at the cost of lives and nobody gives a shit; and I
see we're moving on to neo-feudalism, that's the
service economy coming at you. We will all serve. I'm
not quite sure who we're serving. There's a sort of
mystery there; are we serving Bill Gates? I think not,
he's too visible. Somebody else? Maybe you're sitting
right here (in the audience). Are you out there? Fuck
off, if you are. (positive audience response) And if
you're not, well we missed a grand opportunity to
level with each other."

 - during a live performance at Massey Hall, Toronto,
Canada, 25 March 2000.

VOTE NEW YORK!!!


It's easy to vote this election! Vote the New York way! We're the smartest
city in America and that makes New York State the smartest state! (In
spite of Albany!) We have the major museums! The biggest shows! In this
city we have neighborhoods from over one hundred and twenty countries!
Where I live we have the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Mark Morris
dance studios - a huge building devoted to one company, built from the
ground up! New York Dolls! Bella Abzug! We have radio stations for every
taste! Our cultural economy is tremendous - where else can you find
regularly, at a thrift shop, Benjamin and Frege, Pavese, and Madison's The
Hermeneutics of Postmodernity? We have the major newspapers, magazines,
cultural journals, anywhere in the English-speaking world! We are the home
of Yiddish theater and hiphop and just about every form of jazz ever
created or discovered! We're the city that produces around the clock, that
never sleeps at night, that constantly moves, dances, and thinks! Our
daily news is almost always political, and our ball team is one of the
best in the country - so good in fact, that we let Boston have the series
this time! And we're liberal enough to tolerate a bit of fascism as Bush
and his cohorts coughed their way through a national convention! Bill
Clinton! The West Village! Civil right and wrongs! We've got the best
artists, and poetry begins and ends here, no matter what you heard about
the west coast! Our art's so important Terry Allen had to make fun of it!
We've got institutions like St Marks and the Met (which? opera or museum,
take your pick) that are nowhere else to be found on the continent! And we
take our politics seriously without moronic lip-service to god and
country! We'll pledge allegiance if the country deserves it! We know the
flag's a piece of cloth! We'll stand tall for or against the powers that
be, and we'll lead the country in demonstrations if we have to! Vote for
us and let us decide! A vote for us is a vote for justice everywhere -
we've got the best law schools in North America here - even Derrida came
and spoke over and over again, Kristeva just did her heart-stopping tour!
We take nothing from no one! We've had the Talking Heads! If we're going
to have a mob, we're going to have the best mob in the world! If we're
going to dig up dirt on someone, we'll do it to the bottoms of our
pockets! If we're going to riot, we'll be second to L.A. but nowhere else!
Saturday Night Live! Springsteen just across the river! We move furiously
on public transportation! We have one of the lowest crime rates in the
nation, and one of the smallest ecological footprints anywhere! We have
some of the best universities in the world, some of the most committed
filmmakers, and our writers are second to none! Look at me, at Franz
Kline, at Charlie Parker, look at the Harlem Renaissance, look at Walt
Whitman, look at the Brooklyn Bridge, and marvel, marvel! And of all the
places in the country, we never lost our cool over 9/11 but took it
bravely and intelligently in stride, even when our thug of a president
came down to make political capital of things! We have Olmsted-designed
beautiful parks, we've got the Jamaica Bay marshes, the Rockettes, even
dancing Santas! We tolerate heterosexuals and just about anyone else; even
men and women can get married, and there's never been a question of gay
rights, which is our fight and yours, although you might not know it! We
question our race relations, our sexual relations, our religious
relations, up front and in your face! We don't file style but make it, and
you can't follow it if you don't live here, because you don't have the
energy! Everyone comes here sooner or later and does something, and even
if they leave, they're never the same again! We're smart when it comes to
voting, we know the ecological score, the home security score, better than
most; we know the foreign policy score, we've got the United Nations, and
there's less trouble in the streets in that regard than anywhere else in
the USA! We're remarkably tolerant and we recognize our faults and work on
them, hard as hell, even in the onslaught of Republican slaughter in an
unjust war! Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground! And we'll tell you
this, that Bush is NOT our president, that his country is NOT our country,
no matter what you hear! We're too smart for that! Sorry Toronto,
Montreal, L.A., Chicago, we're the cultural capital of North America!
Kathy Acker! Apollo Theater! We're the synaptic pulse coursing through
your heart and your neighbor's heart and everything good and bad brought
to you in the name of capital, progress, liberality, liberalism,
liberation, fury, rap, fashion, power, electric culture, Broadway
universe, WiFi universe, mass transportation, just the good life with
thrift-shop books and the headquarters for the Daily Show! NBC ABC CBS and
radio radio radio! Forget Hollywood, that has-been home of cocaine creeps
and heroine harries. Come visit, bring your cash, you'll need it, and we
need it too! Whatever you heard, you don't have to watch your back here!
We're the Soul of the world! We invented Soul! We got Catholics, Muslims,
Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, Witches, Warlocks, Santeria and more!
And when you vote Democratic, just think, you'll be voting with the best
of what this place has to offer, this United States, which may not be much
outside of the five boroughs, but it's all we've got! So let us lead you
to the promised land, and Vote New York, Vote New York, Vote New York!!!!

army   (for mary jo)

sowing out of time
the duck
a quack if ever
drained of its etoms
a lol ogy gone wild
in these tamed waters

tired from pulling the levers in his sleep
a young swan
beds down for the night
the choice he bet on still
a bet away

each season is out of
place this
grain like the two lips in the movie
tonight that weren't yours

other creatures are fed by the keeper's
hand tho the keeper acts like other creatures
born here to this pond
a LAGOON  more like it
unmasked the mask worn as the mask is
worn   frayed about the edges
the ties that bind it to the
skin

within reason  the carbon hark
dying beast & this love
a jagged rock at the edge of water
speaks of extinction as only a "solid"
can

army follows army
into the waiting stench
the coming growth
army wading thru feed toward
the  SAG -

gone round again &
round a n  other cycle

Thanks, Rob.

The bit I'm not sure about is the language damage in the compound word. 'About' I had me doubts (!) and also the hanging D.T. (I've
only just realised what that bastard's initials mean (!) btw.

All the Best

Someone on the list recently wrote that addiction is
the continued indulgence in something one feels they
oughtn't indulge in. That's an interesting definition,
but, as others have pointed out, addition can be a
physical, physiological fact--even if one doesn't feel
they oughtn't indulge in whatever they're addicted to.

Opium, for instance, is very addictive, but, besides
the woeful effects of withdrawl, can be safely used
for the entirety of one's life--if one can manage to
always have a supply of the stuff. It needn't drive
anyone mad or sickness or crime. Many notable figures
have been and are addicted to various painkillers
(didn't McCarthy have a steady supply of morphine
throughout his life? Take a look at the new book
Reefer Madness : Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the
American Black Market
by Eric Schlosser).

I'm not sure how this relates to poetry--I'm not sure
one can be "addicted to words" anymore than one can be
addicted to air--as we're in language like we're in
air. But it (addiction) might serve as a metaphor for
the poetic impulse, to use, as Murat writes, "language
in excess of communication," that is, "uselessly," to
"thwart[]" communication. Wasn't it Wilde who said art
is useless?

I wonder.

All the best, and happy voting day,

Joseph

MIME-Version: 1.0

Dear Bradley,

Do not make of the vomits. And do not be afraid.

Here is why.

My grandmother, she has 89 years. She is very old.

She cannot see so much with her eyes. She cannot walk
so much the good.

She has recently "fallen" to make of an injury to her
legs. Imagine only to fall and hurt your leg. This is
the shame of the old person.

BUT

My grandmother, she is to live in the Viroqua,
Wisconsin. The Viroqua, Wisconsin, she is a small city
outside of the LaCrosse, Wisconsin. The Viroqua,
Wisconsin, she is filled with so many of the old
Norwegians.

Velkommen til Viroqua!

And these old Norwegians, they are to make of a HATRED
for the President.

These old Norwegians are old farmers and ranchers.
They know that the President is a fake cowboy! The
real cowboys, they do not act this way! The real
cowboy, he is silent and helpful! He does not abuse
the helpless!

These old Norwegians are old Christians. They know
that the President is a fake Christian! The real
Christians, they do not act this way! The real
Christian, he is selfless and peaceful! He does not
abuse the helpless!

So my grandmother is to make of a hatred for the
President like maybe I am to make of a hatred for the
Interpol or the Franz Ferdinand bands.

This is a serious hatred.

So, Bradley. So please. Do not make of the vomits. And
do not be afraid. For the election of the Wisconsin
"swing state", she is safe in the hands of the old
Norwegians. This election, she is safe in the hands of
my beautiful grandmother.

So maybe my grandmother, she is so old. Maybe she is
never to make of the president voting again. This is
an unbelievable sadness to me. So much love for the
nonna.

But do not cry! For my grandmother, she will cast the
deciding ballot today! My grandmother, she will cast
the deciding ballot in Wisconsin -- and the Wisconsin
electoral college votes, they will go to Senator John
F. Kerry!

This is some way to go! This is, how you say, "guns
a-blazin'"!

Arrivederci con le pistole!

A salut for my beautiful grandmother to hobble on the
walker to the voting poll booth to make of a decisive
vote for Senator John F. Kerry! A salut for my
beautiful grandmother to decide the presidency!

Salut, my nonna!

Nothing like a little cosmic surveillance to urge us on.

By the way, I suspect one sign of the weakness or strength of the Christian
Right Wing - at least in California - will be the difference in the number
of votes for Bush and the number of votes in support of the Stem Cell
Research initiative. This is on the assumption that Moderate Republicans
will vote for the Initiative.  The difference in the two votes should put
the Counter-Scientific brand of Evangelical Republican into numerical
perspective.

Dalachinsky digs

It appears Steve is the only guy who gets it. A poem is where those covert
and subtle power words dissolve into a watery elixir of meaning. If you swim in
it or drink it you're connected. You're making it. It's not about dictionary
definitions. It's about the roots tangled way back there when-where words are
made and the leaf that falls into your hair. Same tree. To say, to decree, to
make something so. Out of the hwyl, the black lagoon of unconsciousness, the
torture of light, the self, the other. What do the words cream and milk evoke,
provoke in you? Kerouac said beat and he meant beatific and beat down and beat
up and jazz. Too many words, too much oxygen, too much carbon dioxide - the
addiction to breathing, talking for what? To be a waste of skin? It's the
joy-terror wheel, the meat wheel where connection is better than addiction. I'm
hooked on making the futile flesh fertile. Feirfez, like Parzival's turtledove:
melange co(u)lomb poisie hame. Word. It's what's for dinner. You are what you
eat. We live in alien individual universes, one from the other. I don't need to
have the same philosophy as Dalachinsky. Can you hear me now? Dig.

C'mon...Let's just cut this addiction debate down to the basics. I'm a word
junkie & make no bones about it. It started 44 years ago when some guy with
5 o'clock shadow named Kerouac offered me a taste at the soda shop where
kids weren't supposed to go after school. The first one wasn't free back
then, contrary to myth. It cost me 50 cents. Plus tax, if you can imagine
that. What did I know? I was just a kid. Then he introduced me to his
supplier, Burroughs, and the rest has been downhill. Olson, Whalen,
Bernstein, Nichol...not to mention  a thousand others...they've all been The
Man at one time or another.

Most of you know how it works. If you don't, you're kidding yourself. You
start with a poem or story-just an experiment, always an experiment -and it
leads to a way of life. A way of life in which you'll do anything to get
that fix. And I mean anything.

On a good day I just cut a few words out of a dictionary, and cook them in a
water-filled spoon with my lighter till they form a solution, then I draw
them into an eyedropper. I puncture a vein with a needle then put the
eyedropper over not in the hole and squeeze gently, till the rush blows me
away. Then I nod over my computer and wake up to find a page filled with all
the words in my system, and it's time to cop more.

On a bad day, I'll do anything: grab a thesaurus and eat the pages, ask my
wife to turn tricks in front of a bookstore (she always refuses, tells me to
read what I have), steal Derrida out of little old ladies'
purses....whatever it takes to feed my habit Sometimes none of this works.
Like today. So, I'm standing on the mean streets in Florida, offering to
vote for anybody who'll give me my writing fix...just a few words to crank,
c'mon...Name your man & I'll cast the ballot. I need my fix. Bad. And I
gotta do what I gotta do.

Wouldn't you?

Unrepentantly Yours in Shame & Degradation,

Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech

Monday 01 November 2004, 16:01 Makka Time, 13:01 GMT

Following is the full English transcript of Usama bin Ladin's speech in a
videotape sent to Aljazeera. In the interests of authenticity, the content
of the transcript, which appeared as subtitles at the foot of the screen,
has been left unedited.

Praise be to Allah who created the creation for his worship and commanded
them to be just and permitted the wronged one to retaliate against the
oppressor in kind. To proceed:

Peace be upon he who follows the guidance: People of America this talk of
mine is for you and concerns the ideal way to prevent another Manhattan,
and deals with the war and its causes and results.

Before I begin, I say to you that security is an indispensable pillar of
human life and that free men do not forfeit their security, contrary to
Bush's claim that we hate freedom.

If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example -
Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like
those of the 19 - may Allah have mercy on them.

No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We
want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our
nation. So shall we lay waste to yours.

No one except a dumb thief plays with the security of others and then
makes himself believe he will be secure. Whereas thinking people, when
disaster strikes, make it their priority to look for its causes, in order
to prevent it happening again.

But I am amazed at you. Even though we are in the fourth year after the
events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception
and hiding from you the real causes. And thus, the reasons are still there
for a repeat of what occurred.

So I shall talk to you about the story behind those events and shall tell
you truthfully about the moments in which the decision was taken, for you
to consider.

I say to you, Allah knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the
towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and
tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine
and Lebanon, it came to my mind.

The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when
America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth
Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and
injured and others were terrorised and displaced.

I couldn't forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and
children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants
and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on
our home without mercy.

The situation was like a crocodile meeting a helpless child, powerless
except for his screams. Does the crocodile understand a conversation that
doesn't include a weapon? And the whole world saw and heard but it didn't
respond.

In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul,
but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny,
and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors.

And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind
that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy
towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so
that they be deterred from killing our women and children.

And that day, it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional
killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate American policy.
Destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and
intolerance.

This means the oppressing and embargoing to death of millions as Bush Sr
did in Iraq in the greatest mass slaughter of children mankind has ever
known, and it means the throwing of millions of pounds of bombs and
explosives at millions of children - also in Iraq - as Bush Jr did, in
order to remove an old agent and replace him with a new puppet to assist
in the pilfering of Iraq's oil and other outrages.

So with these images and their like as their background, the events of
September 11th came as a reply to those great wrongs, should a man be
blamed for defending his sanctuary?

Is defending oneself and punishing the aggressor in kind, objectionable
terrorism? If it is such, then it is unavoidable for us.

This is the message which I sought to communicate to you in word and deed,
repeatedly, for years before September 11th.

And you can read this, if you wish, in my interview with Scott in Time
Magazine in 1996, or with Peter Arnett on CNN in 1997, or my meeting with
John Weiner in 1998.

You can observe it practically, if you wish, in Kenya and Tanzania and in
Aden. And you can read it in my interview with Abdul Bari Atwan, as well
as my interviews with Robert Fisk.

The latter is one of your compatriots and co-religionists and I consider
him to be neutral. So are the pretenders of freedom at the White House and
the channels controlled by them able to run an interview with him?  So
that he may relay to the American people what he has understood from us to
be the reasons for our fight against you?

If you were to avoid these reasons, you will have taken the correct path
that will lead America to the security that it was in before September
11th. This concerned the causes of the war.

As for it's results, they have been, by the grace of Allah, positive and
enormous, and have, by all standards, exceeded all expectations. This is
due to many factors, chief among them, that we have found it difficult to
deal with the Bush administration in light of the resemblance it bears to
the regimes in our countries, half of which are ruled by the military and
the other half which are ruled by the sons of kings and presidents.

Our experience with them is lengthy, and both types are replete with those
who are characterised by pride, arrogance, greed and misappropriation of
wealth. This resemblance began after the visits of Bush Sr to the region.

At a time when some of our compatriots were dazzled by America and hoping
that these visits would have an effect on our countries, all of a sudden
he was affected by those monarchies and military regimes, and became
envious of their remaining decades in their positions, to embezzle the
public wealth of the nation without supervision or accounting.

So he took dictatorship and suppression of freedoms to his son and they
named it the Patriot Act, under the pretence of fighting terrorism. In
addition, Bush sanctioned the installing of sons as state governors, and
didn't forget to import expertise in election fraud from the region's
presidents to Florida to be made use of in moments of difficulty.

All that we have mentioned has made it easy for us to provoke and bait
this administration. All that we have to do is to send two mujahidin to
the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written
al-Qaida, in order to make the generals race there to cause America to
suffer human, economic, and political losses without their achieving for
it anything of note other than some benefits for their private companies.

This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare
and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside
the mujahidin, bled Russia for 10 years, until it went bankrupt and was
forced to withdraw in defeat.

All Praise is due to Allah.

So we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of
bankruptcy. Allah willing, and nothing is too great for Allah.

That being said, those who say that al-Qaida has won against the
administration in the White House or that the administration has lost in
this war have not been precise, because when one scrutinises the results,
one cannot say that al-Qaida is the sole factor in achieving those
spectacular gains.

Rather, the policy of the White House that demands the opening of war
fronts to keep busy their various corporations - whether they be working
in the field of arms or oil or reconstruction - has helped al-Qaida to
achieve these enormous results.

And so it has appeared to some analysts and diplomats that the White House
and us are playing as one team towards the economic goals of the United
States, even if the intentions differ.

And it was to these sorts of notions and their like that the British
diplomat and others were referring in their lectures at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs. [When they pointed out that] for
example, al-Qaida spent $500,000 on the event, while America, in the
incident and its aftermath, lost - according to the lowest estimate - more
than $500 billion.

Meaning that every dollar of al-Qaida defeated a million dollars by the
permission of Allah, besides the loss of a huge number of jobs.

As for the size of the economic deficit, it has reached record
astronomical numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars.

And even more dangerous and bitter for America is that the mujahidin
recently forced Bush to resort to emergency funds to continue the fight in
Afghanistan and Iraq, which is evidence of the success of the
bleed-until-bankruptcy plan - with Allah's permission.

It is true that this shows that al-Qaida has gained, but on the other
hand, it shows that the Bush administration has also gained, something of
which anyone who looks at the size of the contracts acquired by the shady
Bush administration-linked mega-corporations, like Halliburton and its
kind, will be convinced. And it all shows that the real loser is ... you.

It is the American people and their economy. And for the record, we had
agreed with the Commander-General Muhammad Ataa, Allah have mercy on him,
that all the operations should be carried out within 20 minutes, before
Bush and his administration notice.

It never occurred to us that the commander-in-chief of the American armed
forces would abandon 50,000 of his citizens in the twin towers to face
those great horrors alone, the time when they most needed him.

But because it seemed to him that occupying himself by talking to the
little girl about the goat and its butting was more important than
occupying himself with the planes and their butting of the skyscrapers, we
were given three times the period required to execute the operations - all
praise is due to Allah.

And it's no secret to you that the thinkers and perceptive ones from among
the Americans warned Bush before the war and told him: "All that you want
for securing America and removing the weapons of mass destruction -
assuming they exist - is available to you, and the nations of the world
are with you in the inspections, and it is in the interest of America that
it not be thrust into an unjustified war with an unknown outcome."

But the darkness of the black gold blurred his vision and insight, and he
gave priority to private interests over the public interests of America.

So the war went ahead, the death toll rose, the American economy bled, and
Bush became embroiled in the swamps of Iraq that threaten his future. He
fits the saying "like the naughty she-goat who used her hoof to dig up a
knife from under the earth".

So I say to you, over 15,000 of our people have been killed and tens of
thousands injured, while more than a thousand of you have been killed and
more than 10,000 injured. And Bush's hands are stained with the blood of
all those killed from both sides, all for the sake of oil and keeping
their private companies in business.

Be aware that it is the nation who punishes the weak man when he causes
the killing of one of its citizens for money, while letting the powerful
one get off, when he causes the killing of more than 1000 of its sons,
also for money.

And the same goes for your allies in Palestine. They terrorise the women
and children, and kill and capture the men as they lie sleeping with their
families on the mattresses, that you may recall that for every action,
there is a reaction.

Finally, it behoves you to reflect on the last wills and testaments of the
thousands who left you on the 11th as they gestured in despair. They are
important testaments, which should be studied and researched.

Among the most important of what I read in them was some prose in their
gestures before the collapse, where they say: "How mistaken we were to
have allowed the White House to implement its aggressive foreign policies
against the weak without supervision."

It is as if they were telling you, the people of America: "Hold to account
those who have caused us to be killed, and happy is he who learns from
others' mistakes."

And among that which I read in their gestures is a verse of poetry.
"Injustice chases its people, and how unhealthy the bed of tyranny."

As has been said: "An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure."

And know that: "It is better to return to the truth than persist in
error." And that the wise man doesn't squander his security, wealth and
children for the sake of the liar in the White House.

In conclusion, I tell you in truth, that your security is not in the hands
of Kerry, nor Bush, nor al-Qaida. No.

Your security is in your own hands. And every state that doesn't play with
our security has automatically guaranteed its own security.

And Allah is our Guardian and Helper, while you have no Guardian or
Helper. All peace be upon he who follows the Guidance.

I should be warier of contributing here because I don't have access to the
full thread. But it seems that the central idea of Nick's first entry has
gone underappreciated. In his post of 10/30, he writes of the
"sanctimonious overtones" attendant to most citations of addiction. In
other words (that is if I understand Nick correctly), "addict" is a
category which is 1. negatively valued (vis-a-vis some "healthy" norm), and
furthermore 2. typically deployed against individuals and populations from
without, i.e. by "non-addicts." It is true (and made clear in Nick's post
of the following day) that people can self-identify as addicts; indeed, as
the language of pathology becomes increasingly prevalent in everyday life
("I'm so depressed," etc.), such auto-diagnosis would seem to be ever more
common. But the etymological evidence pretty much proves Nick's initial
point. Ad + dicere: "to hand over, assign, surrender, adjudge," fine. In
any case it refers to a speech act by which persons and/or things have
masters assigned to them by some licensed jurist. Even Mary Jo acknowledges
the idea of the punitive "sentence" lurking in the Latin.

So who pronounces this sentence? The addict, or the person who names them
as such? We might say that someone "sentences" him- or herself to a given
condition by engaging in behaviors we deem unwise, but it's definitely "we
non-addicts" who are saying it, in the same sanctimonious tone Nick was
referring to. Notice that when the word "addict" is self-applied, it
amounts to an acknowledgement that the speaker 1. has indulged in these
behaviors (or at least has some propensity for them), and 2. shares in some
measure the judgment which militates against them. If there's another way
to understand the metaphor, please point it out to me. But I should think
the word's affiliation to Roman legal vocabulary would make its
sanctimonious kernel apparent to most readers.

To anyone left unsatisfied with the language of "addiction," I might
suggest the alternate metaphor of being "hooked," which seems a more
visceral expression of the addict's experience, and without the censorious
overtones. --Also, in response to Joseph's claim that opium "can be safely
used for the entirety of one's life," I cannot resist appending the
important caveat by James S. Lee (a turn-of-the-century British colonial
who picked up the habit in India) that reliance on "one drug alone spells
disaster." Coffee drinkers, you've been warned.

For more reading, see Avital Ronell's _Crack Wars_ (just reprinted by U. of
Illinois Press). My copy is in storage, so I'm unable to tell how closely
my remarks parrot hers. But I haven't forgotten her paraphrase of an
article by Derrida -- "Rhetorique de la drogue" I think the title is?
Anyone have a citation for it? I have found both writers to be very
persuasive on this and many other topics LRSN

I have that book - I actually ordered it from the US even tho I live in NZ
and it was available new at Borders and I sell second hand books myself
(Apect Books) on www.abebooks.com   ! lol !   But I go to reading Pessoa
thru a friend who is of Portuguese descent  ( Hamish Dewe now actually in
China ( he translates Pessoa and some Spanish poets)and read his poems with
the alter egos etc in  and he is an interesting/fascinating poet.  But the
line I remember is  via hamish -  something like this:  "Portugal, the
blazing face of Europe!" !!

 I was diverted into reading the classics and various things but The Book of
Disquiet is waiting for me and after reading the huge bio of Pollock and am
reading thru a book of the work of Hans Haacke the conceptual/ social
political artist.
  In 1993 I was in the MOMA and I saw the famous painting of a baby's head
kind of suspended (I think it must be by a South American artist possibly
Matta, Siquieros or (other)(s):
does anyone know the painting as it inspired part of in my Infitite Poem????
I knew of the painting before I got their (NY) but it is only since then I
have made wider study of many of the artists in the brochure I got from the
Guggenheim....at the time I wasnt too au fait with art...or i was less au
fait....

Addendum to Save  Message  Numbers: I am following the elections in the US
her i New Zealand on Prime (Australia's channel 9) cant see any big diff
between Bush and Kerry - both are bull shit artists and rhetoricians who
will keep US Imperialism flourishing and the atmosphere of fear alive: but
there you go, that's my view, and what's new, such as Perloff, Monsieur
Piombino, Comrade Nudel, and R S etc etc obviously disagree...they (I think)
(of course I mean K & B, lol!) are both warmongers who have bought into this
"War on Terror"  ..I call it the "War of Terror"  At a poetry reading last
night the guest (Levin the Showman - who is frm South east Asia but has been
in NZ for  quite a time and is a politico- surreal poet I think could be
defined) poet hoped for Bush to lose - another opinion. Hopefully Kerry's
actual agenda is more pacific than his rhetorised one....

This is a goofd post. I'm not "addicted" to smoking but I am addicted (to
use the much tangled term) to valium- I self adjudge myself to be such (I
"revealed it in poem called "Hospital which is to be in Brief published
locally (NZ) soon) - point here is that for years I kept it even form my own
children and none of my colleagues or workmates knew; I was wise enough to
know it wasnt a good idea to tell people  - but now i am basically retired )
I express a 'reality' but I am also aware of the self-fulfiling aspect-
since I have let it be known certain individuals (not many though) I would
think were more supportive have "attacked" me or been censorious - somewhat
sacntimonious - in fact they were concerned I think - others just take it in
their stride but one always feels (I suffered a nervous breakdwn when I was
19) that there is a degree of hostility, fear, disgust, or just fear or
prejudice toward the addict- but by and large this is not a problem most
people are I feel sure so busy with their own lives this is not big deal -
and also of course these days "mental illness" (I'm not mentally ill or even
remotely unhappy - just a bit neurasthenic)  is less a problem with people -
the 'problem' is a) to what extent the addict "goes public" (to get help)
and b) to what extent does my saying I am an addict (aclcoholic etc)
reinforce this addiction - in other words what is the best way to work on
this impediment or problem (of smoking, drinking, drug taking etc)
  Nick always has some excellent wisdom and I respect him in this area of
etymology and psychological/philosophical/social issues etc By the way
valium is (I believe) more addictive (probably much less harmful tho) than
cocaine, smoking, alcohol etc - and again I acknowledge the problem with the
word 's connotations and  so on

In looking over my post of a couple hours ago I'm struck by a jarring note,
which is the way Mary Jo Malo's contribution (to a debate she herself
began) gets minimized. "Even Mary Jo acknowledges etc." I don't know why
that's phrased concessively --her insight about the "sentence" implied in
the concept of addiction implies is sharp and as far as I know completely
original. So I'd like it if that readjustment could be noted.

Also, in the interest of full disclosure I find myself awkwardly obliged to
point out that on his blog, Nick Piombino has posted some very kind remarks
about my NY reading with Hassen this past weekend. Oops if the throb of
gratitude in my post is poorly disguised. Wishing everyone a restful
Judgment Night LRSN

ruling everywhere the three women determined our fates in the future
world. they were the dixie chicks and they were incredibly hot. they sang
and sang and the audiences were full of heart and sometimes they disagreed
but they held their ground. there were religious revivals and unbelievable
moments of ecstasy as amazing high notes were reached and held. what could
be more beautiful than to hear the incredible dixie chicks singing their
hearts out and the hostile audiences responding with care, love, and true
caress. i would love to be at their concert and would love to swoon in
front of the dixie chicks. i would be their slave forever, each of them
equal to the others, and none of them would be ahead of the others and i
would worship them equally.

my name is jennifer and i want to second this account of the love and
beauty of the dixie chicks and the ecstatic wonder and delight their
performance inspires in me. every performance has its own beauty and its
own wonder but every one of them is what i call weather-beauty because
just like the weather the beauty stays forever inside me.

i am nikuko and i can only agree and i do understand the many languages
that are sung and spoken by the dixie chicks and they do wonder-weather
me as well. someone said, well why don't you say something about the
dixie chicks and so i am saying it here, this beauty they inspire and the
religious revival they set in motion wherever they speak and sing.

i am jennifer again and they do speak and sing so well. and i am nikuko,
no this is really jennifer, i am having a wonder-fun with nikuko.

we are the dixie chicks and we inspire with our singing and our talking,
and our religious revival work which we do so well and full of heart and
our audiences are full of warmth and heart-felt caring and we love them so.

Seve (and Listees) - thanks for your thought that Siquieros - I can look for
the painting  in a book of Siqieuiros's art - the artist - the painting I
mean was in the MOMA in1993 I dont supose it's there all the time - I'll
'patch' the  stuff referring to it sometime.

This is vital and original stuff you have here Steve I liked the first part
especially - the second is good too but maybe more subtle ..maybe with more
references, connections....

I dont think that Bin Laden exists - the Right Wing and the big guys in
Industry and the military are using various ploys to keep people in a state
of fear,.terror etc and in all probabilty these videos of Osama are done by
an actor or simulatated by technology, dubbed etc. If he even existed he is
quite proabbly dead...Its neither for Bush or Kerry. It is irrelevant - they
both want to continue the Capitalistic/Imperialistic system and continue the
War (of) Terror

WHY - if the US millitary etc are concerned about terror havent they
forceably seized someone - or everyone - at the TV Station that these things
are transmitted from (so they can forceably extract who was the deliverer
etc - get leads to Osama -etc)  The reason is because the dont want to!!
They aid and abet these videos - the rulersof the world - the bourgoesie
have no real democracy - they are using propaganda and terror to (for them)
brilliant effect. The elections are  just a kind of fireworks display. If
the US really wanted to avoid terrorism they would withdraw all miltary from
everywhere outside the US immediately - the truth is they need terror, they,
or the state, thrives on terror -- as in 1984 the Inner Party needed the
Enemy Goldstein. 1984 and Animal farm is just about all one needs to read to
comprehend what is going on with US and British Imperialism in the world
today. The Imperialist powers always need to keep the "pot boiling" they
never really wnat democracy anywhere (treu participatory frdeomcracy) and
they NEED enemies -imagimary or real or both. They also use fear of gays
etc - hence the high concern about marriages bewteen gays which Bush played
with to excellent effect....It is very echoic of a certain gentleman(men)
extant in Deustchland in the 1930s.......

This doesn't alter the truth of much that is said here by Lawrence.

The Republicans of course would rather stop the contest now before
all the votes are even counted.

What they want to do now is start the manipulation machine rolling--
so Republicans simply declare victory and throw money at the problem.

This is not over. How about you finish counting the votes Ohio?!

If Kerry concedes all is lost. e-mail friends and family in
Ohio if need be and declare Kerry the winner of this election!

as we morn our dead and this election hangs in the the dirty hands of
lawyers, I see nothing but great hordes of greedy red eyed beasts
stomping down the street to walmart, killing queers and consuming
plastic by-productst, defecating biohazard material in every direction,
mindless of the hungry and the suffocating

I resign in disgrace again and again and again from this empire. I want
nothing more to do with this institution within an institution within
an institution, this a piece of rotting meat rotting on a meat hook
waiting to feed its obese populous. this aging empire, this worshiping
godcock land, eats its own, promotes greed, hate, bigotry and war to
maintain its toaster oven degree producing factories and its instant
mash potatoes tomorrows...

the only option left is to let this country rot and sink into oblivion,
any truly revolutionary spirit is coughing its compromised lungs out
searching for a better all consuming zone of  liberal virtual safety,
an extra outlet, and flush toilets...

let it sink, let it rot, let this cancer eat itself alive..

I seek asylum, I renounce my citizenship, I renounce this land of slave
owners

its time to live a dangerous life and die trying...to pull away from
this land, and renounce it all... let it sink praying to its godcock,

  let this country sink into its own waste

find a land to move to. abandon ship and let the rats rule...

I am officially seeking asylum in any country that will take me..

waking up the day after tomorrow (actually after only a small nap) and
hoping that Bush does not hurt all those who supported him I welcome
Mary Jo's and Steve's almost uncomfortable direct approaches-- naming
names-- with fearless abandon-- because of them we have a real hope of
changing the terms of battle

many of us are tired of condescension, of causual, unconscious elitism,
of shop-worn P. C. pieties

they're a welcome dart directed at complacency, especially since many
of us (meself included) squalked and crowed...

bring on the mix... and count every vote... or live in a Christian nation,
forced to genuflect each time King George breaks wind...

I've wondered if Bin Laden is real, or maybe I should say really the villain
that the government makes him out to be. After all, the CIA trained him, and
he appears to have ties with the Bushes. He's come across as a charismatic
embodiment of Evil---the turban, long beard, why not add a magic carpet?---
that seems to come out of a wicked fairy tale. The 1984 analogy is right on
the money; I've been using it for some time, myself. At times, I suspect
he's not living in a cave in a mountain near some border, but in a very
comfortable palace that he probably never leaves. Maybe he is a political
fiction. Apparently we're going to have another four years to observe the
effectiveness of the Big Lie technique.

I dont think that Bin Laden exists - the Right Wing and the big guys in
Industry and the military are using various ploys to keep people in a state
of fear,.terror etc and in all probabilty these videos of Osama are done by
an actor or simulatated by technology, dubbed etc. If he even existed he is
quite proabbly dead...Its neither for Bush or Kerry. It is irrelevant - they
both want to continue the Capitalistic/Imperialistic system and continue the
War (of) Terror

WHY - if the US millitary etc are concerned about terror havent they
forceably seized someone - or everyone - at the TV Station that these things
are transmitted from (so they can forceably extract who was the deliverer
etc - get leads to Osama -etc)  The reason is because the dont want to!!
They aid and abet these videos - the rulersof the world - the bourgoesie
have no real democracy - they are using propaganda and terror to (for them)
brilliant effect. The elections are  just a kind of fireworks display. If
the US really wanted to avoid terrorism they would withdraw all miltary from
everywhere outside the US immediately - the truth is they need terror, they,
or the state, thrives on terror -- as in 1984 the Inner Party needed the
Enemy Goldstein. 1984 and Animal farm is just about all one needs to read to
comprehend what is going on with US and British Imperialism in the world
today. The Imperialist powers always need to keep the "pot boiling" they
never really wnat democracy anywhere (treu participatory frdeomcracy) and
they NEED enemies -imagimary or real or both. They also use fear of gays
etc - hence the high concern about marriages bewteen gays which Bush played
with to excellent effect....It is very echoic of a certain gentleman(men)
extant in Deustchland in the 1930s.......

This doesn't alter the truth of much that is said here by Lawrence.

I took time off from election work to go to the day of the dead parade last
night.

If you don=B9t know about the day of the dead parade, it=B9s a slow parade that
begins at 24th and Bryant and winds its way up 25th to officially end aroun=
d
24th and Mission. It=B9s short in terms of distance, but it stops a lot, whic=
h
made it do-able for the current state of my leg. I prefer it to Halloween,
because it alternates between a somber and a festive tone. Both moods, in
fact, may be felt at the same time. Sure, there is a kind of =B3party
atmosphere=B2 with loud drums, costumes, incenses, and people walking around
on stilts, but the candles that people hold tends to make more room for the
darkness and the silence than many of the holidays in the =B3dark half=B2 of th=
e
year (such as the Christmas blitz), and, yes, There is a haunting feeling, =
a
purge, and if I had both my legs, there may have even been a physical
catharsis. In any event, not the silly commercial Halloween goblin =B3boo=B2 bu=
t
the tables set for the dead in the park. Even the most =B3secular=B2 or least
=B3superstitious=B2 may come to feel in a slow dreamlike walk that the line
between the living and the dead is more permeable than the everyday hustle
and bustle of western civilized society.

Now the fact that it was election day may have just added to that feeling,
and soon I found myself over at The Dark Room for the Pirate Cat Radio
Election Coverage, which brought one back to a =B3reality=B2 that must be
contended with, a reality I think many of us
have got to make sense of, and try to figure out how to do something about.

For the last few months, I=B9ve been thinking more than usual about the kind
of questions raised in =B3What=B9s The Matter With Kansas? HOW CONSERVATIVES WO=
N
THE HEART OF AMERICA=B2 by Thomas Frank, and with the election results in,
there=B9s a feeling of helplessness, coupled with an anger, but also an
attempt at humility.

For instance, a side to me wants to scream, =B3THE DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY
=B3SCREWED=B9=B2 So Much For Checks And Balances. No President, No House, No
Senate, and No Supreme Court Majority. But to even say the word =B3SCREWED=B2
would probably be taken as a flippant side of some literally MARGINALIZED
BORDER (if not exactly COASTAL) =B3ELITE=B2 that is out of touch with the large
majority of the geographical middle of the United States (as all the blue
states, I=B9m pretty sure, are either on the margins of America, or contiguou=
s
with states that are).

If you don=B9t want to be the flippant, cultural elite snob, it=B9s time to
really try to figure out what=B9s going on with people in the middle of the
country who think Bush is a good president, and not just see them as either
deluded or deluding.

So I watch Peter Jennings interviewing the head of the Republican National
Committee
After if had become pretty obvious that Bush had won, and I try to imagine
how most people in the =B3red states=B2 might see Jennings as part of that
=B3liberal media=B2 of the =B3cultural elite,=B2 and sure enough, with those eyes
and ears, he can be seen as disrespectfully grilling the Republican. =B3Well,
in the exit polls in the blue states, most people claim the war in Iraq was
their main consideration in voting for the President, while in the red
states, most people claimed =8Cmoral issues=B9 were more important.=B2


Jennings=B9 snide attitude towards these =8Cmoral issues=B9 was no more =8Cfair and
balanced=B9 than Fox=B9s attitudes toward Kerry. Of course, I=B9m sympathetic wit=
h
Jennings. For surely,
The war in Iraq IS a moral issue at least as much as others. But if this
exit poll does hold any salt, it is interesting that neither side considere=
d
economic issues to be of as much importance as the moral issues involved,
and there=B9s at least a strong POSSIBILITY that
many in the =B3red states=B2 actually voted for Bush in part because they=B9re
sick of these right and left coast city slickers they see on TV telling the=
m
(in varying degrees of directness) they=B9re stupid and/or evil for voting fo=
r
Bush.

So, is this the same kind of culture wars going on that went on in =B3Inherit
The Wind=B2 (the Scopes Monkey Trial)?
Does anybody else who lives on the coast have this horrible dream in which
the man has jumped out of that old painting, =B3American Gothic,=B2 and is
chasing people around with his pitchfork?
Has any chance of an alliance between =B3city=B2 and =B3country=B2 become impossibl=
e
in the current divisiveness?

If one is not a Bush supporter, this election result is even more depressin=
g
than the 2000 one for many reasons. To take the first three that come off
the top of my head:1) The electoral college can=B9t be blamed as much. 2)
Election fraud can=B9t be blamed as much. 3) Nader can=B9t be blamed as much.
We=B9re almost forced to take the medicine that the will of the people went
with George Bush, a Republican majority in both houses of congress, etc.

Sure, there are ways to spin it otherwise. In the first place, the ELECTORA=
L
MAP with its red states and blue states does create the false illusion that
most of America=B9s heartland was SOLIDLY FOR BUSH; that a 4000 mile drive
from Virginia, south to Florida, West to Texas, North to North Dakota, West
to Idaho, for instance, would be a drive through BUSH COUNTRY. That=B9s just
the semiotics of it. In many of those states, at least 40% of the votes wen=
t
for Kerry, so obviously it=B9s not a clear cut division, and obviously many i=
n
those states are upset by the outcome too (some even argue that if many
people who are natives of those states wouldn=B9t have up and left to move to
the coastal states, the electoral picture would=B9ve been quite different).
But what solace can be taken in that? It would be even more hopeless a
gesture of =B3sour grapes=B2 to argue now that WE NEED TO DO AWAY WITH THE
TWO-PARTY SYSTEM for instance---
And thoughts of CIVIL WAR, or SUCCEEDING FROM THE UNION, are even less
likely to become a reality, in part because the geography breakup of Americ=
a
would be even more striking than what would have happened in Canada a few
years back had the Quebecois gotten 1% more of the vote. Sure, we could als=
o
continue to talk about election fraud, not just about people not being
allowed to vote, but more structurally about how only the very rich can run
for president or even congress in most cases=8B

But can the anti-Bush coalition truly take any positives from this election=
?
Isn=B9t it part of a larger trend in which the mainstream of America is movin=
g
further and further away from the great populist spirit of say FDR? Hell,
even after WATERGATE, a conservative democrat, could barely squeak his way
into the white house (8, 000 votes in Ohio would=B9ve decided it), and Clinto=
n
probably wouldn=B9t have won without Ross Perot.
At least the Democrats had at least one of the houses of congress back in
those days.
I think many took solace in 2000 that Gore really had won (and he certainly
won the popular vote), even with all his mistakes, and given the fact that
Kerry did better in the debates in 2004 than Gore did in 2000, many may hav=
e
felt this election would be at least as close (of course the media also may
have made it seem closer---in this I actually AGREE WITH RUSH LIMBAUGH=8Bin
order to get more people to watch a long drawn out ELECTION COVERAGE NIGHT:
THE SEQUEL. In fact, their slowness in calling states last night seemed a
crass move to sell more advertising!)

It was =B3Close=B2 enough that many now say they are ABSOLUTELY DISENFRANCHISED=
,
but what to do about it?
Riot in the streets?
Hope for an apocalypse of some sort, another Al Qaeda attack, or wait for
the Iraqi casualties to roll in?
Wait for the economy to get worse and worse in the red states, like another
=B3Dust bowl=B2 that will suddenly make people realize that economic issues
matter
as much, and maybe more, than legislating morality?
(Why DO people in Kansas care if people are gay, or pro-choice, etc., on th=
e
coasts, or in the bigger cities?)
NONE OF THESE OPTIONS SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS DEFEAT

Can we be gracious in defeat? And how to do that without =B3rolling over?=B2
Maybe just maybe it=B9s really time for a general stock taking of traditional
Democratic values, on a large scale.
Some could say it=B9s just about the candidate=8Blet=B9s find someone better next
time---
Maybe it=B9s time the Democrats look for a woman presidential candidate. It
would HAVE TO BE another southerner, someone popular in the south, west, or
Midwest swing state. I don=B9t want to just get into the =B3I TOLD YOU SO=B2 to
all those democrats who voted for Kerry in the primaries because he was mor=
e
=B3electable.=B2 A Mass. Senator! A little more charisma, etc=8A..

But maybe the question of values needs to be addressed more thoroughly on a
larger scale. One =B3RED HERRING=B2 for the democrats has generally been the
support of gun-control, and the way that seems inconsistent with their
pro-choice stance on other issues.

But how to deal with the social conservatives in the heartland?
Maybe the condescending attitude towards them from many =B3in the blue=B2 IS a
problem.
Maybe there should be more sit-coms, or reality TV shows, based in
=B3UNGLAMOUROUS=B2 places like NEBRASKA. Maybe this election indeed was
A kind of revenge by these people for having to watch and listen to so much
programming that is biased towards a city life, city values, etc---
I.E.---=B3THEY=B2 (of the red) know more about =B3US=B2 (of the BLUE) than we know
of them!
And seriously I do believe there an be a common ground between the =B3red=B2 an=
d
the =B3blue,=B2 but it=B9s not going to be found through electoral politics, and
it=B9s currently not found very much in the national
entertainment/infotainment industry either (not even for the most part in
the poetry world; though maybe in FOOTBALL, with its salary cap that gives

Too little too late. According to the AP, Kerry's already
called Bush to concede.

The difference between the exit polls released at
5PM Eastern time (Kerry winning by a lot) and the
hideous outcome this evening is striking.

One could ask: is there any difference between the
exit poll / final result discrepancy in
        1. Precincts that have verifiable votes
(such as paper ballots and eVoting with a paper
trail and
        2. Precincts that have no way to verify
results (using suspect tools such as Diebold
eVoting machines).

Well, guess what, a poster in a progressive blog
has done a quick test and - lo and behold - in
precincts where the votes are verifiable, the
votes fall within the margin of error.  But in
precincts where you cannot verify the vote guess
what?  Bush amazingly gets a five point bump above
the exit polls.  John Kerry would win the
Presidency handily with those 5 percentage points.
I am hoping that Mr. Kerry's people pick up on
this.

You can read this astonishing discussion at
http://tinyurl.com/7yry6.  This story is something
that may or may not unfold over the next few days.
I sure hope it does.  The fact is, through nearly
30 years of exit polling that I remember, the exit
polls were spot on.  The exit polls called it
corrrectly in FLA in 2000 - the newspapers
reported that over 100,000 legal 'over-votes' did
not get counted.  (Nearly 80,000 of those were for
Gore.)

Our democracy has been stripped away by the
eVoting machines - this is where the fight begins.

I'm extremely depressed this morning. As I'm sure
many others are. Nightmares all last night -- the
pod people coming to take me away. Rant all you
want -- and I'm sure I'll rant plenty -- it's
over. The only hope is that the evote fraud story
has "legs," but that doesn't seem likely. I
actually found myself fantasizing about the
Governator somehow being able to run in 2008,
because the only challenge for this regime may
come from the socially liberal/fiscally
conservative side of its own party (i.e. Giuliani
and Schwarzenegger et al.).  Seriously -- we could
be looking at 20 years of neocon dominance, with
the Dems helpless to stop it.

The most depressing moment of all, for me, was
when someone at CBS took a closer look at
individual counties in Ohio. there was one county
-- I forget which -- that had lost more jobs than
any other in the state, and those voters always go
democrat. well, guess what? they didn't this time.
Why? "Moral issues" i.e. abortion and gay marriage
and stem cell research. As several have pointed
out on this list, at some point midway through the
2nd pres. debate Bush (or whoever was controlling
him) just said, "screw it, I'm not going to try to
win these debates, I'm going to speak to my base."
Phrases like "culture of life" began to dominate
his responses, and he began to call Kerry "senator
kennedy."

Karl Rove had seen something important about
cutting to the chase and appealing to these people
directly, turning what had been their biggest
weakness (it was divisiveness over these issues
that crashed the Republican party in 1992) into
their biggest strength. the democratic party is in
"shatters," to use Kerry's term.

What is more alarming than anything is that a majority of voters chose Bush based on issues of morality. What are they talking about? Is being afraid of science, wreckless with the environment, backwards with women's rights, ignorant of the economy, elitist with health care and arrogant on public policy the new morality? Are they for real?

Uh ... maybe I'm preaching to the choir.

Let me just say, as a resident of Florida, I'm sorry.

After all the talk of Iraq and jobs and fear-mongering, the election
results seem to have added up to this:

Missionary Position 1

Homophobia 0

As for asylum, I have longed for spending my declining years hanging out in
Coffee Houses in Amsterdam obliterating my mind with endless hashish.  A
good way to go.

However, I suggest that people gain some perspective, and identify with how
long-suffering people can survive.  As a Jew, I have a historic imprint of
living for centuries on the margins and worse, and even today, supposedly
elevated by Israel, I feel betrayed.  Think of the Palestinians living a
half century in refugee camps (a drop in the bucket of suffering, except
when you consider what it's like to be born and grow up in a giant jail or
living under occupation).  How many years of slavery, how many years of the
"nadir" of Jim Crow have Black people survived?  How many centuries of
burning witches?

So, don't loose your spirit.  We have the solidarity of the entire world,
and we can build a world-wide front against the US empire and religious
extremism of all types.

I do imagine attending a meeting in Amsterdam of The  Anti-Imperialist
Committee in Solidarity with the American People . . . in a delicious haze
of forgetfulness.

Love to all,

Hilton

Let the trees & shrubs absorb the shock
Not one lover or friend deserves this:

'The Election'

Climb the highest hill, indeed
Or descend into the lowest valley

Is one ready to resist Repression?
It's no longer 'If' but 'When'

"And the rockets gave way," etc.

Welcome to the big "A", America
Welcome to the big "R"

There will be little precedence
for this "Salvation"

Is one ready to organize (again)?
The inevitable pronounces itself

Breathe, she says, breathe
Find the internal 'humm'
Find it, breathe it

Let's go - only as one can - from there.

Allen Ginsberg--

America I've given you all and now I'm nothing.
America two dollars and twenty-seven cents January 17, 1956.
I can't stand my own mind.
America when will we end the human war?
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb
I don't feel good don't bother me.
I won't write my poem till I'm in my right mind.
America when will you be angelic?
When will you take off your clothes?
When will you look at yourself through the grave?
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites?
America why are your libraries full of tears?
America when will you send your eggs to India?
I'm sick of your insane demands.
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good
looks?
America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.
Your machinery is too much for me.
You made me want to be a saint.
There must be some other way to settle this argument.
Burroughs is in Tangiers I don't think he'll come back it's sinister.
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke?
I'm trying to come to the point.
I refuse to give up my obsession.
America stop pushing I know what I'm doing.
America the plum blossoms are falling.
I haven't read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on
trial for
murder.
America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies.
America I used to be a communist when I was a kid and I'm not sorry.
I smoke marijuana every chance I get.
I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.
When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid.
My mind is made up there's going to be trouble.
You should have seen me reading Marx.
My psychoanalyst thinks I'm perfectly right.
I won't say the Lord's Prayer.
I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations.
America I still haven't told you what you did to Uncle Max after he
came over
from Russia.

I'm addressing you.
Are you going to let our emotional life be run by Time Magazine?
I'm obsessed by Time Magazine.
I read it every week.
Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.
I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library.
It's always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious.
Movie
producers are serious. Everybody's serious but me.
It occurs to me that I am America.
I am talking to myself again.

Asia is rising against me.
I haven't got a chinaman's chance.
I'd better consider my national resources.
My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of
genitals
an unpublishable private literature that goes 1400 miles and hour and
twentyfivethousand mental institutions.
I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underpriviliged who
live in
my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns.
I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go.

I have a friend in Beijing, a Pound scholar, who can get a travel grant if
he applies by November 10.
He asked if I knew of any conferences or symposia on the work of Ezra Pound.
I didn't. Can anybody
out here help me? Please backchannel.

Thanks,

Subject:      election & churches
MIME-Version: 1.0

It has been a pet theory of mine for about seven years now that people on the
religious right are as "well organized" as they are because every Sunday of
every week, all 100 million of them (or however many there are) go to church --
where they have, in effect, a mini-political rally.

I think it's easy for us to be distracted by the idea that the mass media are the
main mobilizing force for the majority of the population.  I think what has flown
right under our radar is that the PRE-MODERN institution of the church, with its
ability to give force and direction to the lives of tens of millions in this country,
was probably THE decisive factor in this election.

The Republicans have of course courted the religious right for decades.  But it's
with this election (apparently) that they've finally figured out that they can
approach the churches directly, as we've been hearing in the news.  (Indeed,
the connections could go deeper: I, for one, would like to see an investigation of
what the sources are for the sermons given out week after week all over the
country.  Who writes them, precisely?  The pastors only?  Or...?)

I was wondering, as election day approached, whether the Republicans' directly
approaching the churches would make a difference in voter turnout.  If the polls
are any indication, it obviously did: the number-one issue for voters for Bush
was "values".  It would be a mistake, I think, for Democrats to take this as a cue
to go Christian on us.  (Though in their typically blundering way, they'll probably
try it.  They already have.)  Instead, they and everybody else should recognize
that the people who put "values" at the top of their list were people who go to
church.  It's not the values that matter here so much as the institution that
mobilizes the people who articulate them -- and the political party that courts the
institution.

We should start looking at these churches and open communications with them,
friendly or otherwise.  (You can bet there's abuse going on in those churches --
sexual and otherwise -- that is just ripe for investigation.)  We should start
having a discussion with them -- directly -- about freedom, justice, class and
inequality in this country.

But we also need to think about countervailing centers of population as well.
We have to outnumber, person for person, the entire right-wing church
population.  The only way I can see to do that is 1) court the moderate religious
population, and 2) center our attention on the cities.  Cities can counterbalance
churches.

Yes, differences in values matter here.  But it's the real, concrete institutions that
allow these value differences to carry political force.

This Sunday, all the evangelicals in the country (*how* many tens of millions?)
are going to go to their churches again and congratulate themselves.

We should start thinking about paying them a visit.

Churches are real.

A House of Dust

standin' high an' ancient, worn an' brittle on a hill
leftover from a daydream there's a great ol' house o' dust
in every crooked window tired curtains cling the rotten sill
an' through all the ages busted panes resist no season's thrust

every battered door unhinged but the rustin' locks still sound
the burglar 'r the henchman walk the place right with the saint
timbers set beneath a different sun keep it all from fallin' down
an' every new owner puts on his own new coat of paint

ya can whisper, ya can scream, ya can mumble 'r shout
ya can come t' bring peace 'r harm
no answers, no lies, no thoughts are held out
they blow through them rooms like a storm

no single body's held from its rooms
in it ya'll find what ya find
no single body's held from its tomb
neither cruel nor kind

To the
sea; the being ashamed of a
silent dog. A person who will come by,
but poverty is worth a while, after supper
walk a single tree to leave off.

He that would turn back a mackerel. Treachery will fall go hand in kind.
He himself that for want of wisdom. Everything dear is in the
White House. A horse the crocodile meeting a shame; but if the sea,

The
sea; the ounce.

Faint heart is in the killing of
one of a hole for
somebody else; you must crack the sooner

Ounce.

Faint heart is at the head is nearest the naughty
she-goat who will gain sits waiting patiently in the fatted calf but not

follows death than oxen. The ground can
fall no lower.

Hunger finds no lower.

Hunger finds no lower.

Hunger finds no Guardian or Helper.

Head is blind in the traitor.

An

Head is good if men take to return to the
sea; the herb that highest kicks his
rear.

Return to leave off.

He that has walked with
truth generates life. "Injustice chases its sons, also for the sun does
not make light work. Show the weak man when it of a
silent dog.

Walked with
truth generates life. "Injustice chases its season.

Walked with
truth generates life. Perfect love my mother is
at the gander.

Perfect love my mother is
at the beard. Dry bread at the marrow is the sign invites you can keep
yourself safe from a helpless child, powerless except

Three women and a horse the weak man whose father was fire in

The slow horse with the spider that
knows what it would not be afraid of the world.

Beard. Dry bread at once.

The vine brings milk to the coals. He who drinks too many; and they be

After a great house is too few. Long absent, soon

somebody else; you are brave. Make hay
whilst the hedge at once.

follows death than a man must drink water. Whoever has walked with
truth generates life. "Injustice chases its flight.

As you must behave like a reaction.

Sickness of its flight.

As you yourself safe from the fathers have eaten sour
grapes, and a pound of what it is the ground can
fall no fault of prevention is drawn,
it in the mouth.

What would one day become extinct from under the fatted calf but the
killing of
one of a gift sells his security, wealth and they be afraid of what it
is
the
very stone in the
White House. A single tree to bray.

Old age is a hole for
somebody else; you eat the thing that
fattened him.

Fathers have the outdoor shrine, and is
not beaten, then that is at hand.

The poor men take to leave off.

He that is good if the fault of tyranny." When he himself that is our
security has
automatically guaranteed its nest. And a
crowing hen tomorrow. The gander.

Is
not beaten, then that is worth a good
appetite there is bad. If you must drink water. Whoever has been bitten
by the rich to outclass his whole house.

Everything

Good
appetite there is not care of palm-fronds. If they perform for every
state that for his own security. A bird does not dig a mountain heifer.
Do not perform
miracles on the most scars is the fox
could not make a tough bough. We have,
but we bring on horseback and the heart is in silk or
scarlet. Better own science.

You do not a whistling girl and the bone.

There is slippery.

Care of pleasure, the coals. He is drawn,
it in error." The outdoor shrine, and a great house of prevention is
lost; for the rider is made and is
not beaten, then that is as Adam. Love my mother is
at the other side of what it is better an ass, it would learn to return
to return to be known by the fox
could not cut off the fathers have the being ashamed of patience.

An eye is slippery. He causes the young and every action, there is as
Adam. Love my mother is
at the silent ones of a funeral. Better than his screams.

Created the 11th as their security, wealth is ... you.

It is in business.

Be aware that
it is time when one day become extinct from us why we witnessed the
security of tyranny,
and gave birth to fight tyrannical superpowers, as they say: "How
mistaken we are the pretenders of the 19 - according to you, Allah knows
his security, wealth and
children sprawled everywhere.

... you.

It is he who are still engaged in the throwing of children is in the
Israelis to avoid these images and Helper, while America,

Engaged in silk or
scarlet. Better to be thrust into an ass, it the 19 - according to our
people what it will gain sits waiting all for a while, after supper
walk a drum
is not in light of Bush administration has automatically guaranteed its
citizens for 10 years, until it easy for Allah.

That being said, those events and stay than persist in
error." And a reaction.

Thrust into the weak man whose father was hurled at hand.

The poor men were telling
you, the outdoor shrine, and political losses without their private
interests over their achieving for
it anything of the
bleed-until-bankruptcy plan - all
praise is worth a person who walks alone carries a weapon? And nothing is
drawn,
it in another Manhattan,
and deals with their
families on the 11th as they were terrorised and severed limbs, women and
severed limbs, women and became
envious of tyranny." When one of pounds of the military regimes, and the
security is blind in election fraud from under the ounce.

Faint heart never occurred to our fight in
Afghanistan

Hurled at the house is hard to restore freedom at the public interests
over the storm, the ideal way started in the causes the loss of children
for years before the 19 - as we, alongside
the mujahidin, bled Russia for the horse the hedge at once.

The vine brings milk to Allah knows his own science.

You do is afraid of poetry.
"Injustice chases its flight.

As you have mercy on the silent ones from killing of you can observe it
will come by,
but poverty is a shame; but the weak man whose father was like
Halliburton and concerns the young and his whole of a
silent dog. A helpless child, powerless
except for defending his security, wealth and nothing is hard to our
people of a
silent dog. A funeral. Better than 1000 of the fatted calf but you want
for securing America and researched.

Among the twin towers in the decision was hurled at home without mercy.

The situation was fire in
your skin.

The slow horse the security has
automatically guaranteed its citizens for every action, there is alive.

Restore freedom at the loss of wealth is bad. If a great house of a
silent dog. A conversation that the killing of a thief.

Beauty draws more important of his liberty. A
black hen tomorrow. The world
are with a pound and thus, the liar.

Kevin Thurston, Lauren Bender, Justin Sirois and I have put together a PDF =
containing bios and some texts/objects as an invitation to sample some of t=
he writing/composing coming out of Baltimore via the Portable Collective.

We're using the PDF as a bridge. We will send the PDF to anyone who wished =
to potentially host us at their reading series, outside of Baltimore. So fa=
r we've read at the ACA gallery in NYC, the Fusion Arts Museum in Brooklyn,=
 NY, and will be reading at the La Tazza series in Philadelphia on November=
 20th. Next Year we will read in Ithaca, NY, somewhere else near Ithaca, NY=
 (late March) and in Washington, DC at the In Your Ear reading series TBA.=
=20

We are in turn inviting many poets from outside Baltimore to read at the Po=
rtable Reading series. Each memeber of the Collective will invite a poet/wr=

After hearing George Lakoff on NPR this morning debate down an extremist
Christian right-wing caller who said she registered earlier this year =
after
30 years of non-voting specifically to vote Yes on the Louisiana ban gay
marriage amendment and who wanted to un-separate church and state in =
favor of
a divine right theocracy with King George W at the helm, I couldn't help
feeling even more depressed than I already did, but also more focussed =
in my
despair and depression.
=20
Basically I agree with George Lakoff and the Rockridge Institute (
<http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/> http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/) =
that
the extreme Christian right has hijacked the terms of the national moral
debate and with these terms, over 50% of the popular vote. The same
repetitive framing and biased contextualizing that made "liberal" a =
dirty
word and added "partial-birth abortion" to the national vocabulary has
essentially worked its way into the emotional unconscious of the =
majority of
the population and made it even harder for Democrats to win back the =
swing
voters who are susceptible to the conservative linguistic brainwashing.
=20
My gut feeling is that most people vote emotionally, not intellectually. =
This
is nothing new, but the Dems haven't been as able to use (I hesitate to =
say
exploit) this concept as effectively as the right-wing Repubs. The Dems =
bring
up issues, and complexity, but the Repubs appeal to reductive emotions =
like
fear, indignation, a "we're just right, they're just wrong" kind of =
attitude.
If Dems go for issues of the heart like health care or senior care, the
Repubs go for the distraction tactic of throwing in religious ideology =
with
the reductive emotions. Once you bring God into the debate it's almost =
always
like hitting below the belt.
=20
So I think to win back the country the Dems need to win back the =
perception
that they are the populist party (another stand hijacked by the =
radio-show
Right), and to win back the populist stance they need to tap into core
emotions that are stronger than the Right's. What are these emotions? =
Lakoff
and his institute have some ideas, I only hope they cut to the core as
powerfully as ye olde fire & brimstone.
=20
This is about language. This is about the most widespread form of =
official
political verse poetry. The terms frame the emotions, and in turn the =
voter
choice. When the Kerry campaign came out with its slogan "A Stronger =
America"
I have to admit I really cringed at first. Ick. What a slick marketing
statement, what a sound byte, everything I hate. But then as the weeks =
rolled
on I started to see the point. The slogan was actually a pretty good =
blanket
summary of emotional strengths the Dems wanted to stand for across the =
board
-- stronger international diplomacy, stronger international credibility,
stronger domestic social policy, stronger workforce, etc. So Kerry was
one-upping the conventional perception that the Repubs are the strong =
guys.
And Kerry's message of "reclaiming the moral high ground" was =
strategically
the right tactic to take in the post-WMD post-Fahrenheit 9/11 climate.
Obviously millions of people saw right through the Bush Admin's
self-justifying manuevers and wanted to stand behind a challenger who
represented a stance that was emotionally (and logically) more correct.
=20
So as much as I feel the heartbreak of this very close election, I also =
feel
the hopefulness that comes from it being so very close. Considering that =
the
country has never voted an incumbent president out of office in the =
middle of
a war, the fact that the popular margin was only 2-3 points really says
something. And the fact that Kerry prevailed in the upper midwest really =
says
something hopeful about how the Dems can retain support in that =
transitional,
post-manufacturing region.
=20
I want to believe that most of the people who voted for Bush, who voted =
for
the anti-gay marriage amendments, are not rabid froth-at-the-mouth =
extremists
like the woman on the NPR call-in line. I want to believe that they are
passive moralists, who wouldn't necessarily be very mobilized without
aggressive flyering from their local Christian Coalition, who when =
presented
with the ballot choice vote in the default direction, the way their =
family
thinks, the way their neighbors think, the way their church leader =
thinks,
etc. I want to believe that enough of these people, enough to make up 2% =
of
the voter population, are passive enough in their convictions to be =
swayed to
the other side by a set of arguments they find to be emotionally =
compelling
and overriding.
=20
Someone brought up the stem cell research initiative here in California =
as a
possible litmus test of this moderate swing vote. That initiative passed
(authorizing funding to allow research to proceed) by 59 to 41. That's =
about
four points wider than the statewide margin that won California for =
Kerry
over Bush. So roughly speaking the Prop 71 campaigners were successful =
at
swaying 4% of Bush voters over to stem cell research. How did they do =
this?
By pouring in tons of $$$ (Beverly Hills/Palo Alto cash plus Gov. =
Arnold's
endorsement, itself worth millions in this sorry state) and by appealing
again and again to tearjerking emotional concerns ("research will cure =
my
5-year-old daughter's diabetes, would have cured my ex-president dad's
Alzheimers") that overrode competing moral concerns about injecting =
nuclei
into eggs to make embryos that won't make it to birth.
=20
At least Obama got his senate seat.
=20
Rock on.

Not to be overly pessimistic, but while we continue to struggle, as we
must, the water is rising and the sky darkening, and a lot of what's done
and doing can't be undone. This past two days I've been driving east across
Arizona and New Mexico. The saguaros have been exterminated from a hundred
miles of desert where I got used to seeing them until recent years, and on
brilliant sunlit days there's a constant haze. Just north of El Paso
there's a couple of miles of feed lots along the Rio Grande, which must do
wonders for the water.

So the fight's for whatever crust is left, and the other side is on god's
time--none of it matters, if the US does what it should the world will be
finished anyway and the saints will have ascended.

pamela, yours is the first post that draws me out into the light of
the screen... may i forward it to a few friends/family?... excellent
observations that highlight why ideology isn't just about logic, but
about feelings... the emotional subtext is often what divides us in
the voting booths, and this fact is often lost in those analyses
claiming that, despite our differences, we're basically alike in our
beliefs... yes, we can be talked into compromises, under the right
conditions... but there is no thought as such independent of
conditions, and survey conditions cannot replicate the heat of
political action/sentiment... karl rove is a pro at exploiting the
electorate's feelings, but there has to be something there to be
exploited... the guns/god/gays triad is a kind of shorthand that many
voters evidently respond to w/o a whole lot in the way of critical
thought...

that said (if i may), it's a dire moment for the american dream, and
i don't think we have any way of knowing where we're headed
collectively (though it's clear that if you liked the last four
years, the next four promise to be much, much better)... if the left
has to reinvent itself, this won't just be about rhetoric and
politicking (if those too), but about some very real
reconceptualizing of our beliefs, and finding new ways to turn them
into social action...

and finding support and funding for such social action...

i would also like to see what's just transpired catalyze something
like a counterculture... i'm holding out hope for this---wishful
thinking, some will say---but in any case i don't believe it's the
sort of thing that can be legislated, as to my way of thinking, such
a scenario is just beyond the horizon... i'm sure too that this will
have a lot to do with young people (which is to say, some of us may
need to get out of the way)...

anyway, thanx for that, and to others for their posts on this
immensely disappointing day...

best,

joe

I heard the exchange between Lakoff and the lune this afternoon, and I
wasn't shocked by it in the least. The fact is that the US populace
has moved to the right, and the Bushies know very well how to play to
peoples' fears.

Let's face it: the Democratic party is bankrupt. Kerry is as much a
corporate lackey as Bush. But, Bush is better at it. An old CP
professor of mine used to say, "When you run a fake Republican against
a real Republican, the real one always wins." Yeah, yeah, Kerry is a
Mass. liberal, but both parties are the same: THE PROPERTY PARTY. And
Bush doesn't really know what a Republican is but that doesn't matter
either because President Cheney does. It will be interesting to watch
what President Cheney does now that he has no need for Georgie.

Rove and Team Bush throw up smoke screens like same sex marriage, stem
cell research, abortion to distract people from the looting they are
doing to the country and the slaughter that they committing all over
the world.  I work for one of the premier biomedical research
institutes in the world, I can't believe the bill California just
passed. The State has massive budgetary issues, and they are throwing
$3B at stem cell research, which is such a wasps' nest. What kind of
sc research? Adult? Embryonic? Mouse? Monkey? Chicken? Estimates say
that we're at least 20 years away from finding therapies that will
work from human embryonic sc research. The thing that California will
do will be to drain the rest of the US of stem cell researchers. All
embryologists will be running out to California as if they were 49ers.

We all sit here behind our computers moralizing about this joint, but
the honest truth is that we all live our comfortable American lives on
the "riches" of the last 50+ years stemming from the US military
industrial complex's voracious appetite.

We are all complicit in this. This won't change. We just need to get
honest with ourselves.

anastasios, i hear you... against the global realities, the u.s.
looks prosperous generally...

still, i tend not to like to be told that life here is so great, ergo
we shouldn't give a damn about the minimum wage, poverty in the u.s.,
etc... not that you're saying this, of course... in fact my sense is
that we ARE all complicit to varying degrees (i repeat:  to varying
degrees), but no solution will likely work that fails to engage with
the fact that desire continues unabated...

some of the best historical materialist thinkers i know drive suv's
and have large cd collections... i don't see that about to change
anytime soon... this does not negate materialist thought as such, but
it does suggest that a solution (as opposed to an analysis of the
problems) will have to account for such desires (which some of the
best thinkers i know can't seem to manage, unsurprisingly)... people
who make their way out of poverty will want what those who have never
lived in poverty have always had... and i can't blame them... or to
put it more autobiographically, i don't blame myself, even if i do
question my desires... push come to shove though, i just love good
cold cuts, and am willing to shell out for same, if you know what i
mean... ditto a smooth interface...

so i continue to see a very real difference twixt kerry and bush, all
of nader's and others' naysaying aside... again, my time on public
assistance is what i rely on in making such a claim... while i can
imagine other perspectives, that particular perspective feels like
the right one in this case at this time... and as an artist of sorts,
i find the symbolic proportions of this election not a little
difficult to swallow... so the dems may be bankrupt as a party, as
you put it, but we'll need to find an even harsher language to
describe the once and future republican party...

best,

joe

A concession is only a formality. If by some miracle Ohio turned out to

I think that until you begin to analyze and deal with the beliefs that lie
behind the terms -- and stop assuming that Christians are passive, backwoods
morons that knuckle under whenever their pastors tell them something -- you
won't begin to win the battle for the so-called moral high ground. Isn't it
almost quaint at this point to resort to a linguistic, psychological
explanation of the American citizen? Do you think that people can be
reprogrammed, like droids, as long as they are presented with terminology
that represents reality in a more reasonable way?

I detect, behind your (and Lakoff's) thesis, another assumption that seems
radically wrong. It is that people are *not evil*, that they are basically
neutral, or even good. In order to get to the bottom of what's wrong with
America, if that can be done from a contemporary perspective, I think you
will have to rethink that assumption. Anastasios did a fine job of revealing
the reality of American greed and selfishness.  It's not, at that level,
"about language."  It is about a desire to protect the ranch, to dig in
one's heels, to ignore poverty, starvation; it is an inability to imagine
life outside the border, and it afflicts all Americans.

I think the accepted leftist explanation of heartland America is possibly
what has weakened the liberal ideology the most.  The fact is that *no*
American, whether they live in red states or blue states, wants to dirty
their hands with helping others. Rightists ignore other people's troubles
altogether; leftists rename people and create state programs for them; but
nobody, it seems to me, has discovered the true moral high ground.

Yes, as Anastasios says, the Democratic party is bankrupt; I would like to
see a resuscitation of the left, though. The first step is to recognize that
there is no real meaning in a semiotic game of checkers. The  second is to
take people and their worldviews seriously.

I am sorry for my tone here, especially to Pamela, whom I don't know from
Adam.  Hope this is meaningful to someone, nevertheless,

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Notes on the election -

0. The Republican win was predicted and predictable. Now the infinity
of analysis begins, an infinity that has already missed the point.

1. There is nothing the Democrats might have done 'better.' The country
voted its conscience.

2. Its conscience is founded on a morality-based worldview, which is
rural in origin, and relatively rigid.

3. 9/ll played a critical role, not only in revealing the extreme
vulnerability of the country, but also in the production of an Islamic-
fundamentalist alterity that could not be dismissed.

4. With the religious right, fundamental ontology replaces the episteme.

5. Bush appeared, alive and life-like at the World Trade Center ruins
almost immediately after, conjoining his image with the intensity of
destruction.

6. The left continuously focused on the negative aspects of the
Republican party, over-determining, at least in print, the violence of
a world-view at odds with the rest of the planet.

7. Absolute morality is not concerned whatsoever with opinion.

8. The right has been organizing, in the US, for at least a century
and a half; this election and the last have been in preparation for
decades. With the elimination of the 'fairness doctrine' under Reagan,
and with monopoly ownership of local broadcasting, the right has been
able to dominate the 'heartland' without opposition. The corporate and
Christian merge, to the benefit of both.

9. In the 60s, which for many of us appears to be a history of the left,
the right quietly embraced both technology and structural compromises
that increased and solidified its power base, in rural and impoverished
areas of the country.

10. A fundamental flaw is the assumption that so-called minority votes
are liberal and leftist; in fact, the opposite is increasingly the case.

11. The 'American dream' is both part of class distinctions, and a
force in their elimination. Don't underrate its influence; no matter
how hard we try, there is no revolutionary class, but only power,
desire, economic status, and diffused and focused oppression.

12. Corporate America is far more diverse and problematic than the left
assumes; it also presents a very real world of almost infinite choice
and identifications. Its collusions and corruptions are our collusions
and corruptions, and have absolutely nothing to do with God and God's
State.

13. Cultural capital in the US is far more important than economic
capital, and its boundaries cut across the latter in terms of class. We
are all white trash and we are all intellectuals and theorists.

14. Far too many judgments are made 'for' rural and so-called back-
water areas, which are almost never heard themselves. The information
discourse networks and religious institutions of the majority of American
voters are concretely effaced by abstraction. The water of baptism is
not H2O.

15. Morality and fear are interwoven; it is the abject stereotyped
image of gays fucking that appears to corrode the 'clean and pure' body
politic. Your marriage wrecks my marriage. It is a failure of the left
not to deal with this; dismissing the violent imaginary out of hand
ensures its force within the political arena.

16. In conservative America, the negation of negation is not dialectical,
but also a return to a rapturous positivity.

17. If one's religion insists that abortion, for example, is murder,
then any means, including murder as literal self-preservation, may be
used in return as a defensive and pre-emptive action. It is not ever a
question of one side listening to another; it is a question of war to
an infinite degree.

18. The church in rural and disenfranchised America is a communal and
cohesive force, one of the few institutions capable of lived-community
and defense against the rest of the world. But more than this, the
church is also the locus for community activity and identity. To dismiss
it, even in its intolerant and sometimes evangelical varieties, is to
miss the point of its existence. For the individual, the church is
salvation, explaining and preserving morality, even forgiving and
abetting the temptations of sin.

19. The church overdetermines the rest of the world; rural and other-
wise isolated communities have a surprisingly low degree of information
flux. The church provides stability in a late-late-capitalist world of
postmodernity, where selves, ideologies, and languages are contested.
Within testament and testimony, there is no contestation; the church,
in other words, 'puts a hedge around the Torah' (Pirke Avot).

20. In my opinion, the image of Kerry hunting (and killing) was not
only hypocritical and distasteful, but also a premature sign of defeat.
However, this had no affect on the election per se, which was already
determined, way back in the late 60s and early 70s, when Billy Graham
created the first automated post-office in the US - a religious
embrace of technology that forecast the future of the country. Perhaps
the left 'created' - i.e. the hacking manifesto - but the religious
right utilized, entrenched, constructed a primary embrace of individual
and instrumental reason that guaranteed the supple application of power
when and where needed. The only real question here is why it took so
long.

21. The left has been hampered by split ideologies and critique; the
right, which permits no critique, has worked constantly with umbrella
ideologies.

22. What has been exposed and contested in the US is often business as
usual in the rest of the world. We are witnessing a movement from
republic to empire, from the primacy of voting, to the primacy of
dominant interests.

23. On a personal level - I have lived in West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
and the Bushlands of Texas and Florida. What happened was no surprise.
I voted early yesterday, and felt a sense of relief at the minor
_punctum_ I experienced. But I had no doubt that Bush would win, that
my voice was primarily personal therapeutic. Instead of despair late
last night/this morning, I've felt that our work, that of an opposition,
has only just begun - that it could only just begin. We have to
recognize, above all, that the US has done the will of the majority;
the more we overlook this, excuse this, theorize this, wonder 'what
went wrong,' the more we are weakened. Perhaps this is a positive sign -
in the sense that the enemy, if it is an enemy, is clear, and no longer
can be dismissed as an aberration.

24. The 'cultural war' is war.

25. Terror is an instrument of war.

26. Religion sublimates terror.

27. I live, you die. Vote or die holds no truck with the faithful.

28. Language is not action. Belief is action. Belief is not language.

29. The explication of fact in Michael Moore is replaced by the
internalization of sin and the body in Mel Gibson. Old Testament, New
Testament.

30  What the right knows: There is always already closure.

From the time it was posted, the post quoted below keeps on coming
back into my mind. On a personal note, the comment that

> my blog has more visitors, my
>>> published poems and books outnumber yours)

hit home. I have often posted the number of hits on
my blog  here on the poetics , thinking this would make the idea of blogging
seem appealing and exciting and successful. But was
I unconsciously boasting and not realizing it? Well,
you can be sure I'll never do that again. Point well taken.
 The second part of this

> my
>>>> published poems and books outnumber yours)

also is something I've thought a lot about, in that not
being a very prolifically published poet has seemed a great social
disadvantage in the current climate of publish or perish.
Which, of course, is one of the reasons I've felt excited about, and wanted
to trumpet the successes of my weblog *fait accompli*.

The heart of one of  the points being made in Derek Rogerson's post below,
it seems to me, although the word is never used, is the malignant aspect of
how the typical American is either actively obsessed or haunted by the
pressure of competition. Winning is our national obsession- beating out the
other person is at the heart of what it means to be a good American.
My religion is better than your religion, my sexuality is better than
your sexuality, my ideas are better than your ideas, my product
is better than your product, prizes, awards, advertising, ad nauseum.

Anyone who read this list a few years ago probably knows I have
already written and said much too much about how poets are far from exempt
from this critique. As a young person, I avoided an academic
career because the pretentious quality of classroom discussions
upset me and put me off. I'm a little crustier now and I can
take being teased, ignored, or one-upped or all three
at the same time. Posting on this list taught me a little bit about how to
roll with the punches and still participate in and enjoy the discussion- so
I got a little tougher. Still,  some of the critique below seems valid in
some way to me. I'd be curious to know what others think.

I haven't noticed any other responses to the post below until now.

Nick etal -  hi Nick, Alan Chris etc - I like your posts and this one - my
feeling on the dont vote thing is that its good (up to a point) in that it
questions the way power is enacted - it puts a radical (a fairly radical)
position forward and its quite challenging. The problem is what to do....the
world - the US - everyone - are in some kind of power system....

You are right that the emphasis  on competiton and or winning (especially in
western countries ) is excessive ( when Robert Creeley was here in NZ he was
talking of some US poets and Ted Berrigan and the term "loser" came up and
he paused - and he'/ we discussed how nasty, how negative (maybe
destructive) that term is  - of course we didnt think of anyone as being a
loser (especially Ted Berrigan - suerly a great poet - (whether he was
"great" or not) but its a US term (used here  too much now also) (so Robert
needn't have been embarrassed for the US only) ) we need to be more
compassionate, more tolerant of each other, more alert, but also realise
thtat while we are comptetitive we depend enormously on cooperative actions
as human animals. We need more Ted Berrigans !!  ...I saw a book by his son
recently and I really dug the last part of that book.... (I think it was his
lastest book)...

We will also disagree and get angry or not or agree or not or waffle or be
concise or not: but a I think most of us who are poets are -possibly -more
humane? conssiderate ? open? than people who order soldiers into war
etc...perhaps-let's hope we are... You shouldn't worry about your Blogg
though - keep on keeping on!

Subject:      Aggressive Moralists and the Gay Weapon
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

When the gay marriage explosion first started some months
ago, right away I felt something very wrong was in the air.
I mean, the big question I had was, is it possible that this just
happened to be going on so close to one of the most critical
elections of our time, or was it a set up?  Either way, the Bush
League was going to use it to their advantage, that much
was clear.

It is of course possible that it was an organic reaction, part of
an ever growing process of gay civil rights.  But at the same
time, Abbie Hoffman spoke openly and passionately up to
the day he was murdered (I'll never believe he was a suicide)
about American intelligence agencies working very hard to
infiltrate and rupture "left" organizations and movements.

One way or the other, here were these amazing, often
exhilarating spots on the evening news of gay and lesbian
couples lining up at court houses all over America.  I couldn't
decide whether to feel happy or wary.

Then that first speech the president made about amending
the constitution to prevent gay marriage brought the ghost
of Abbie Hoffman to the foreground for me.  Bush had a
chilling replay of his 9/11 concerned and protective
Fatherland eyes for his televised viewers.

The gay marriage focus seemed the perfect smoke screen
to divert attention away from Iraq and all the Haliburton
intrigues.  But more than a smoke screen, it was quickly
looking more and more like a perfectly sharpened campaign
weapon.  So in my concern, I started asking my friends
what they thought, and since I'm queer I thought I had a
safe footing, and no one would or could accuse me of being
homophobic.  Some of my queer friends were furious with
my suspicions, one even hostile about it.  Meanwhile, my
heterosexual friends, for the most part, seemed relieved
to talk about it.

The politically correct atmosphere surrounding the issue
made it that much more of a perfected weapon for The Right.
Straight people on "the left" wouldn't dare say that maybe
we should hold off until November 3rd to dive into this, for
fear of reactions like those from some of my queer friends,
who will leave no room for dialog on the issue, and will
quickly try to strip someone of their "left" associations.

My narrow-minded, born again Christian family in rural Iowa
and Pennsylvania have always seemed my best barometer
for reactions to American politics and moral issues.  When
they talk about Iraq, or the economy, they are clearly unhappy
and critical of the president, but at the same time share a
kind of prerecorded, flat, collective sounding tongue.  But when
gay marriage comes up they REALLY want to own their words,
want the insult to be unique, and said with a frightening and
frightened passion.  Bush is fully aware of who his audience
is at all times, I'm convinced of this.

And here comes John Kerry, and everyone wonders how he
feels about gay marriage, which was rapidly becoming a wildfire
crisis in churches across our nation on Sunday mornings.
In my opinion, this issue became the corner Kerry refused to
believe he was backed into.

Furthermore, abortion was the perfect topic to be interchangeably
and tied with gay marriage as the top two moral battles for
the presidency.  If Kerry wouldn't discuss gay marriage, his
openly pro-choice stance could, would, and did conflate nicely
with the immoral tone of gay marriage.  Either way, Kerry was
loaded onto the liberal pansy wagon, headed down the
campaign trail.

The fact that every state that had a referendum on their ballot
asking voters about gay marriage turned out to be a state that
went to George W. Bush is further proof.  This was a highly
organized war plan.  If you have states where you NEED to
get voters agitated, but the economy is gone wrong, and no one
is too excited about or happy with the president, you make it
clear that they get the chance to vote about a moral issue that
sets their hair on fire.  And they showed up, and they were not
interested in Kerry, so they voted for Bush, and voted NO over
and over against gay marriage.

By the way, I want to point out what horseshit these referendums
on gay marriage are as a tool for making such decisions.  Let's
suppose Johnson had said, "Well now, before we go making a
decision on Civil Rights, we need to ask for the opinions of folks
down in Alabama first."  If he had done that, instead of doing what
was quite obviously the right thing to do, we may still have separate
drinking fountains all throughout the South.  Well, hopefully we
wouldn't, but my point is, you don't ASK people to decide whether
or not something as basic as human rights should be allowed or not.

But the fact is, I just don't see a candidate with enough courage to
make gay marriage legal because it's the right thing to do.  Especially
now that the election was held over a boiling pot of gay marriage,
and won to those who oppose it.

I'm not so sure how passive these moralists, these values voters
genuinely are. But I will pledge this: I plan to remind the kind of
values voters who elected Tom Coburn, who advocates the death
penalty for doctors who perform abortions... and who pledged to
fight against "rampant lesbianism" in our nation's schools how
much they were duped when all they get for their ardor is a
rollback in their capital gains taxes. Those who voted to make our
nation strong again will receive a swift-boat sized reminder when
they have to kiss their jobs goodbye. I'll remind all those who
thought they were voting to screw  "those politically correct
professors" that all they got for their troubles was gas and electric
rate deregulation. For those who voted in Jim DeMint, believing
that he would offer viable legislation to ban gays from their schools,
I will remind them of how now Social Security will be privatized. To
those who voted to strike a blow against what they percieve to be
elitism, I'll remind them how they created a nice safe habitat for the
CEOs to prey on down and out workers. For all those who voted to stand
tall with W. in fighting the jihad, I will remind them of the jihad the have
become. For all those who flocked to the polls in anxious fervor to
oppose abortion, I'll remind them of how (at least) our immediate future.

Gerald Schwartz



After hearing George Lakoff on NPR this morning debate down an extremist
Christian right-wing caller who said she registered earlier this year after
30 years of non-voting specifically to vote Yes on the Louisiana ban gay
marriage amendment and who wanted to un-separate church and state in favor
of
a divine right theocracy with King George W at the helm, I couldn't help
feeling even more depressed than I already did, but also more focussed in my
despair and depression.

Basically I agree with George Lakoff and the Rockridge Institute (
<http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/> http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/)
that
the extreme Christian right has hijacked the terms of the national moral
debate and with these terms, over 50% of the popular vote. The same
repetitive framing and biased contextualizing that made "liberal" a dirty
word and added "partial-birth abortion" to the national vocabulary has
essentially worked its way into the emotional unconscious of the majority of
the population and made it even harder for Democrats to win back the swing
voters who are susceptible to the conservative linguistic brainwashing.

My gut feeling is that most people vote emotionally, not intellectually.
This
is nothing new, but the Dems haven't been as able to use (I hesitate to say
exploit) this concept as effectively as the right-wing Repubs. The Dems
bring
up issues, and complexity, but the Repubs appeal to reductive emotions like
fear, indignation, a "we're just right, they're just wrong" kind of
attitude.
If Dems go for issues of the heart like health care or senior care, the
Repubs go for the distraction tactic of throwing in religious ideology with
the reductive emotions. Once you bring God into the debate it's almost
always
like hitting below the belt.

So I think to win back the country the Dems need to win back the perception
that they are the populist party (another stand hijacked by the radio-show
Right), and to win back the populist stance they need to tap into core
emotions that are stronger than the Right's. What are these emotions? Lakoff
and his institute have some ideas, I only hope they cut to the core as
powerfully as ye olde fire & brimstone.

This is about language. This is about the most widespread form of official
political verse poetry. The terms frame the emotions, and in turn the voter
choice. When the Kerry campaign came out with its slogan "A Stronger
America"
I have to admit I really cringed at first. Ick. What a slick marketing
statement, what a sound byte, everything I hate. But then as the weeks
rolled
on I started to see the point. The slogan was actually a pretty good blanket
summary of emotional strengths the Dems wanted to stand for across the board
-- stronger international diplomacy, stronger international credibility,
stronger domestic social policy, stronger workforce, etc. So Kerry was
one-upping the conventional perception that the Repubs are the strong guys.
And Kerry's message of "reclaiming the moral high ground" was strategically
the right tactic to take in the post-WMD post-Fahrenheit 9/11 climate.
Obviously millions of people saw right through the Bush Admin's
self-justifying manuevers and wanted to stand behind a challenger who
represented a stance that was emotionally (and logically) more correct.

So as much as I feel the heartbreak of this very close election, I also feel
the hopefulness that comes from it being so very close. Considering that the
country has never voted an incumbent president out of office in the middle
of
a war, the fact that the popular margin was only 2-3 points really says
something. And the fact that Kerry prevailed in the upper midwest really
says
something hopeful about how the Dems can retain support in that
transitional,
post-manufacturing region.

I want to believe that most of the people who voted for Bush, who voted for
the anti-gay marriage amendments, are not rabid froth-at-the-mouth
extremists
like the woman on the NPR call-in line. I want to believe that they are
passive moralists, who wouldn't necessarily be very mobilized without
aggressive flyering from their local Christian Coalition, who when presented
with the ballot choice vote in the default direction, the way their family
thinks, the way their neighbors think, the way their church leader thinks,
etc. I want to believe that enough of these people, enough to make up 2% of
the voter population, are passive enough in their convictions to be swayed
to
the other side by a set of arguments they find to be emotionally compelling
and overriding.

Someone brought up the stem cell research initiative here in California as a
possible litmus test of this moderate swing vote. That initiative passed
(authorizing funding to allow research to proceed) by 59 to 41. That's about
four points wider than the statewide margin that won California for Kerry
over Bush. So roughly speaking the Prop 71 campaigners were successful at
swaying 4% of Bush voters over to stem cell research. How did they do this?
By pouring in tons of $$$ (Beverly Hills/Palo Alto cash plus Gov. Arnold's
endorsement, itself worth millions in this sorry state) and by appealing
again and again to tearjerking emotional concerns ("research will cure my
5-year-old daughter's diabetes, would have cured my ex-president dad's
Alzheimers") that overrode competing moral concerns about injecting nuclei
into eggs to make embryos that won't make it to birth.

At least Obama got his senate seat.

Rock on.

And I am still reeling, but my son, who is five, said something in the car
this morning that made me smile and gave me a bit of hope. When he asked me
why George Bush is against gay marriage, I explained to him as simply as I
could that there are people who think, many for religious reasons, that only
men and women should be able to get married and that these people are afraid
of the idea that two men or two women might get married because they think
it will destroy the kind of life they believe their god tells them they
should live. My son sat quietly for a while and then he started laughing,
"It just doesn't make sense!"



"What doesn't make sense?"



"The whole thing. I mean everybody is gay. You love your cousins, and some
are boys and some are girls, and kids love both their parents." (His point
being, of course, that people of the same sex love each other all the time,
and I know he was thinking of his own relationships with his cousins.)



"Well, the people who are against gay marriage say that kind of love is
okay, but that two men or two women shouldn't be able to live together like
maman and I do and be each other's partners and have a family."



"How ridiculous is that?! Anybody should be able to marry anyone. Look, even
those two buildings"--he pointed to two large Manhattan buildings standing
side by side--"they're married to each other. What's the difference if it's
two men or two women?"



The conversation continued like this for a few more minutes, and then I
turned around and said to him, "Shahob, I really like the way you think."
His whole face lit up and then it was time to park the car and take him to
his classroom. And I have been carrying with me since then this small smile
of hope because if my son at five can see what's wrong with the way Bush and
company want to shape our lives in the United States--not to mention the
rest of the world; and don't get my son going on Iraq--and if my son's
impulse is something we can nurture, and if Kerry's loss energizes that
impulse in him, then there really is something to look forward to in
struggling against Bush's agenda, and the only word to describe how that
makes me feel right now is happy.

I can tell you there were attempts (quickly thwarted) in NYS
to float such an amendmnt. And those in leadership in Albany
have told me the whole thing orginated from Rove, who --
after all-- led his bi-ped to deafeat Ann Richards by insinuating
(w/ flyers left on the winshields of cars parked at Sunday funda-
mentalist meetings, which incidentally were also deployed last
Sunday in Lake County, Ohio) 1. she had given gays jobs in
her government, and 2. she was a lesbian.

Joe,

If I were sounding the bell for the American good life that was not my
intention. I have almost all my family overseas, and I see the better
lives that they lead. And, yet, they all envy our decadent consumer
culture in the US. The irony, however, comes with the shock they
exhibit when they learn how many hours people in the US all work.

The issues that some of us are grappling with today are complex and
they do involve ideology, faith, economics, ruthless politics,
history, anthropology, psychology, and on and on. A richness for
poetry me thinks.

I've said this a few times today, and I'll repeat myself:  The
American system needs to be fed capital, and Bush and Kerry are both
corporate hacks. Indeed, their facades are different. Thing would have
"looked" different with Kerry in office, but underneath the trading of
influence and power would have been the same with different players
playing the parts.

We might not have witnessed blatant attacks on the American
quasi-left, but the exploitation would have been going on underneath
the surface nonetheless...

Yes, it is a time for making poems. I'm bummed out because of the election
results, but because of them I've committed myself to writing because over
time writing can change human sensibilities; right now it doesn't look
possible to change anything social or political for the better in this
country. So I hope to play old Walt till Bush returns to his ranch in
Kennebunkport.

I know this feeling. But art keeps the humanistic flame burning through the
darkness of tyrannical times. It's an underground fire, a joyful smoldering.
The Bushes of history come and go, while Whitman remains singing. If
anything, this is a time for making poems.

anastasios, i can't disagree with you... i'm moved to write simply
b/c i don't want us to neglect the fact that (1) seemingly minute
differences in leadership often point to huge differences in cultural
capital, and (2) though people vote against their interests all the
time, there is voting against one's interests and voting against
one's interests...

And go figure this: Oregon, allegedly a liberal state, failed to pass an
expansion of the 1998 Oregon Medical Marijuana Act. Alaska's also went up
in smoke, har har. Montana, the stereotypical land of guns and ranchers,
actually PASSED a medical-marijuana ballot initiative.

It's more complicated out there than the rightists want us to think it is.

aldon, i think i did the former... but since i'm sure we think alike
about this, i may well have done the latter...

in any case i think louis menand's piece in ~the new yorker~ a while
back (30 aug.), "how voters make their choices," gets at least at the
sad realities of voting in the u.s. (and what ABOUT that 40% that
didn't vote?)... i'm all for getting at these realities, but don't
believe we'll turn the current ideological-political situation around
anytime soon, and certainly not in the absence of substantive changes
not only tactically, but imaginatively (i.e., in the way we believe
our beliefs, our social fictions and convictions)... even if bush
melts down in his second term---and many second terms do melt
down---the damage he and his crew will effect meanwhile will be with
us for years to come, i would say (and most directly, we can thank
reagan for this)...

The Ballot or the Bullet

    So, I\'m not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a
    patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a flag-waver -- no, not I. I\'m
    speaking as a victim of this American system. And I see America
    through the eyes of the victim. I don\'t see any American dream; I
    see an American nightmare....let them know your eyes are open. And
    let them know you got something else that\'s wide open too. It\'s
    got to be the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet. If
    you\'re afraid to use an expression like that, you should get on out
    of the country, you should get back in the cotton patch, you should
    get back in the alley.

The Ballot or the Bullet

Malcolm X

April 3, 1964

------------------------------------------------------------------------


[1] Mr. Moderator, Brother Lomax, brothers and sisters, friends and
enemies:
I just can't believe everyone in here is a friend and I don't want to leave
anybody out. The question tonight, as I understand it, is "The Negro
Revolt,
and Where Do We Go From Here?" or What Next?" In my little humble way of
understanding it, it points toward either the ballot or the bullet.

[2] Before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet, I
would like to clarify something concerning myself. I'm still a Muslim, my
religion is still Islam. That's my personal belief. Just as Adam Clayton
Powell is a Christian minister who heads the Abyssinian Baptist Church in
New York, but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try
and bring about rights to the black people in this country; and Dr. Martin
Luther King is a Christian minister down in Atlanta, Georgia, who heads
another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this
country; and Rev. Galamison, I guess you've heard of him, is another
Christian minister in New York who has been deeply involved in the school
boycotts to eliminate segregated education; well, I myself am a minister,
not a Christian minister, but a Muslim minister; and I believe in action on
all fronts by whatever means necessary.

[3] Although I'm still a Muslim, I'm not here tonight to discuss my
religion. I'm not here to try and change your religion. I'm not here to
argue or discuss anything that we differ about, because it's time for us to
submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see
that we have the same problem, a common problem, a problem that will make
you catch hell whether you're a Baptist, or a Methodist, or a Muslim, or a
nationalist. Whether you're educated or illiterate, whether you live on the
boulevard or in the alley, you're going to catch hell just like I am. We're
all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the
same man. He just happens to be a white man. All of us have suffered here,
in this country, political oppression at the hands of the white man,
economic exploitation at the hands of the white man, and social degradation
at the hands of the white man.

[4] Now in speaking like this, it doesn't mean that we're anti-white,
but it
does mean we're anti-exploitation, we're anti-degradation, we're
anti-oppression. And if the white man doesn't want us to be anti-him, let
him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us. Whether we are
Christians or Muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists, we must
first learn to forget our differences. If we have differences, let us
differ
in the closet; when we come out in front, let us not have anything to argue
about until we get finished arguing with the man. If the late President
Kennedy could get together with Khrushchev and exchange some wheat, we
certainly have more in common with each other than Kennedy and Khrushchev
had with each other.

[5] If we don't do something real soon, I think you'll have to agree that
we're going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet. It's
one or
the other in 1964. It isn't that time is running out -- time has run out!
1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has ever witnessed.
The
most explosive year. Why? It's also a political year. It's the year when
all
of the white politicians will be back in the so-called Negro community
jiving you and me for some votes. The year when all of the white political
crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false
promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and
their
treachery, with their false promises which they don't intend to keep. As
they nourish these dissatisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an
explosion; and now we have the type of black man on the scene in America
today -- I'm sorry, Brother Lomax -- who just doesn't intend to turn the
other cheek any longer.

[6] Don't let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you. If
they draft you, they send you to Korea and make you face 800 million
Chinese. If you can be brave over there, you can be brave right here. These
odds aren't as great as those odds. And if you fight here, you will at
least
know what you're fighting for.

[7] I'm not a politician, not even a student of politics; in fact, I'm
not a
student of much of anything. I'm not a Democrat, I'm not a Republican,
and I
don't even consider myself an American. If you and I were Americans,
there'd
be no problem. Those Hunkies that just got off the boat, they're already
Americans; Polacks are already Americans; the Italian refugees are already
Americans. Everything that came out of Europe, every blue-eyed thing, is
already an American. And as long as you and I have been over here, we
aren't
Americans yet.

[8] Well, I am one who doesn't believe in deluding myself. I'm not going to
sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call
myself a diner. Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you
eat some of what's on that plate. Being here in America doesn't make you an
American. Being born here in America doesn't make you an American. Why, if
birth made you American, you wouldn't need any legislation, you wouldn't
need any amendments to the Constitution, you wouldn't be faced with
civil-rights filibustering in Washington, D.C., right now. They don't have
to pass civil-rights legislation to make a Polack an American.

[9] No, I'm not an American. I'm one of the 22 million black people who are
the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the
victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy. So, I'm not standing
here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a
flag-waver -- no, not I. I'm speaking as a victim of this American system.
And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't see any American
dream; I see an American nightmare.

[10] These 22 million victims are waking up. Their eyes are coming open.
They're beginning to see what they used to only look at. They're becoming
politically mature. They are realizing that there are new political trends
from coast to coast. As they see these new political trends, it's possible
for them to see that every time there's an election the races are so close
that they have to have a recount. They had to recount in Massachusetts to
see who was going to be governor, it was so close. It was the same way in
Rhode Island, in Minnesota, and in many other parts of the country. And the
same with Kennedy and Nixon when they ran for president. It was so close
they had to count all over again. Well, what does this mean? It means that
when white people are evenly divided, and black people have a bloc of votes
of their own, it is left up to them to determine who's going to sit in the
White House and who's going to be in the dog house.

[11] It was the black man's vote that put the present administration in
Washington, D.C. Your vote, your dumb vote, your ignorant vote, your wasted
vote put in an ad ministration in Washington, D.C., that has seen fit to
pass every kind of legislation imaginable, saving you until last, then
filibustering on top of that. And your and my leaders have the audacity to
run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress we're
making. And what a good president we have. If he wasn't good in Texas, he
sure can't be good in Washington, D.C. Because Texas is a lynch state.
It is
in the same breath as Mississippi, no different; only they lynch you in
Texas with a Texas accent and lynch you in Mississippi with a Mississippi
accent. And these Negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some
coffee
in the White House with a Texan, a Southern cracker -- that's all he is --
and then come out and tell you and me that he's going to be better for us
because, since he's from the South, he knows how to deal with the
Southerners. What kind of logic is that? Let Eastland be president, he's
from the South too. He should be better able to deal with them than
Johnson.

[12] In this present administration they have in the House of
Representatives 257 Democrats to only 177 Republicans. They control
two-thirds of the House vote. Why can't they pass something that will help
you and me? In the Senate, there are 67 senators who are of the Democratic
Party. Only 33 of them are Republicans. Why, the Democrats have got the
government sewed up, and you're the one who sewed it up for them. And what
have they given you for it? Four years in office, and just now getting
around to some civil-rights legislation. Just now, after everything else is
gone, out of the way, they're going to sit down now and play with you all
summer long -- the same old giant con game that they call filibuster. All
those are in cahoots together. Don't you ever think they're not in cahoots
together, for the man that is heading the civil-rights filibuster is a man
from Georgia named Richard Russell. When Johnson became president, the
first
man he asked for when he got back to Washington, D.C., was "Dicky" --
that's
how tight they are. That's his boy, that's his pal, that's his buddy. But
they're playing that old con game. One of them makes believe he's for you,
and he's got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you, he never
has to keep his promise.

[13] So it's time in 1964 to wake up. And when you see them coming up with
that kind of conspiracy, let them know your eyes are open. And let them
know
you got something else that's wide open too. It's got to be the ballot or
the bullet. The ballot or the bullet. If you're afraid to use an expression
like that, you should get on out of the country, you should get back in the
cotton patch, you should get back in the alley. They get all the Negro
vote,
and after they get it, the Negro gets nothing in return. All they did when
they got to Washington was give a few big Negroes big jobs. Those big
Negroes didn't need big jobs, they already had jobs. That's camouflage,
that's trickery, that's treachery, window-dressing. I'm not trying to knock
out the Democrats for the Republicans, we'll get to them in a minute.
But it
is true -- you put the Democrats first and the Democrats put you last.

[14] Look at it the way it is. What alibis do they use, since they control
Congress and the Senate? What alibi do they use when you and I ask, "Well,
when are you going to keep your promise?" They blame the Dixiecrats.
What is
a Dixiecrat? A Democrat. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat in disguise.
The titular head of the Democrats is also the head of the Dixiecrats,
because the Dixiecrats are a part of the Democratic Party. The Democrats
have never kicked the Dixiecrats out of the party. The Dixiecrats bolted
themselves once, but the Democrats didn't put them out. Imagine, these
lowdown Southern segregationists put the Northern Democrats down. But the
Northern Democrats have never put the Dixiecrats down. No, look at that
thing the way it is. They have got a con game going on, a political con
game, and you and I are in the middle. It's time for you and me to wake up
and start looking at it like it is, and trying to understand it like it is;
and then we can deal with it like it is.

[15] The Dixiecrats in Washington, D.C., control the key committees that
run
the government. The only reason the Dixiecrats control these committees is
because they have seniority. The only reason they have seniority is because
they come from states where Negroes can't vote. This is not even a
government that's based on democracy. It is not a government that is
made up
of representatives of the people. Half of the people in the South can't
even
vote. Eastland is not even supposed to be in Washington. Half of the
senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in Washington,
D.C.,
are there illegally, are there unconstitutionally.

[16] I was in Washington, D.C., a week ago Thursday, when they were
debating
whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor. And in the
back
of the room where the Senate meets, there's a huge map of the United
States,
and on that map it shows the location of Negroes throughout the country.
And
it shows that the Southern section of the country, the states that are most
heavily concentrated with Negroes, are the ones that have senators and
congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery
to keep the Negro from being able to vote. This is pitiful. But it's not
pitiful for us any longer; it's actually pitiful for the white man, because
soon now, as the Negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that he's
in,
sees the bag that he's in, sees the real game that he's in, then the
Negro's
going to develop a new tactic.

[17] These senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional
amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the
right to vote. And the Constitution itself has within it the machinery to
expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people
are violated. You don't even need new legislation. Any person in Congress
right now, who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights
of the people are violated, that particular person should be expelled from
Congress. And when you expel him, you've removed one of the obstacles in
the
path of any real meaningful legislation in this country. In fact, when you
expel them, you don't need new legislation, because they will be
replaced by
black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in
the majority, not in the minority.

[18] If the black man in these Southern states had his full voting rights,
the key Dixiecrats in Washington, D. C., which means the key Democrats in
Washington, D.C., would lose their seats. The Democratic Party itself would
lose its power. It would cease to be powerful as a party. When you see the
amount of power that would be lost by the Democratic Party if it were to
lose the Dixiecrat wing, or branch, or element, you can see where it's
against the interests of the Democrats to give voting rights to Negroes in
states where the Democrats have been in complete power and authority ever
since the Civil War. You just can't belong to that Party without analyzing
it.

[19] I say again, I'm not anti-Democrat, I'm not anti Republican, I'm not
anti-anything. I'm just questioning their sincerity, and some of the
strategy that they've been using on our people by promising them promises
that they don't intend to keep. When you keep the Democrats in power,
you're
keeping the Dixiecrats in power. I doubt that my good Brother Lomax will
deny that. A vote for a Democrat is a vote for a Dixiecrat. That's why, in
1964, it's time now for you and me to become more politically mature and
realize what the ballot is for; what we're sup posed to get when we cast a
ballot; and that if we don't cast a ballot, it's going to end up in a
situation where we're going to have to cast a bullet. It's either a ballot
or a bullet.

[20] In the North, they do it a different way. They have a system that's
known as gerrymandering, whatever that means. It means when Negroes become
too heavily concentrated in a certain area, and begin to gain too much
political power, the white man comes along and changes the district lines.
You may say, "Why do you keep saying white man?" Because it's the white man
who does it. I haven't ever seen any Negro changing any lines. They don't
let him get near the line. It's the white man who does this. And usually,
it's the white man who grins at you the most, and pats you on the back, and
is supposed to be your friend. He may be friendly, but he's not your
friend.

[21] So, what I'm trying to impress upon you, in essence, is this: You
and I
in America are faced not with a segregationist conspiracy, we're faced with
a government conspiracy. Everyone who's filibustering is a senator --
that's
the government. Everyone who's finagling in Washington, D.C., is a
congressman -- that's the government. You don't have anybody putting blocks
in your path but people who are a part of the government. The same
government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government
that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights, deprive
you of
your economic opportunities, deprive you of decent housing, deprive you of
decent education. You don't need to go to the employer alone, it is the
government itself, the government of America, that is responsible for the
oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this
country.
And you should drop it in their lap. This government has failed the Negro.
This so-called democracy has failed the Negro. And all these white liberals
have definitely failed the Negro.

[22] So, where do we go from here? First, we need some friends. We need
some
new allies. The entire civil-rights struggle needs a new interpretation, a
broader interpretation. We need to look at this civil-rights thing from
another angle -- from the inside as well as from the outside. To those
of us
whose philosophy is black nationalism, the only way you can get involved in
the civil-rights struggle is give it a new interpretation. That old
interpretation excluded us. It kept us out. So, we're giving a new
interpretation to the civil-rights struggle, an interpretation that will
enable us to come into it, take part in it. And these handkerchief-heads
who
have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising -- we don't
intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer.

[23] How can you thank a man for giving you what's already yours? How then
can you thank him for giving you only part of what's already yours? You
haven't even made progress, if what's being given to you, you should have
had already. That's not progress. And I love my Brother Lomax, the way he
pointed out we're right back where we were in 1954. We're not even as
far up
as we were in 1954. We're behind where we were in 1954. There's more
segregation now than there was in 1954. There's more racial animosity, more
racial hatred, more racial violence today in 1964, than there was in 1954.
Where is the progress?

[24] And now you're facing a situation where the young Negro's coming up.
They don't want to hear that "turn the-other-cheek" stuff, no. In
Jacksonville, those were teenagers, they were throwing Molotov cocktails.
Negroes have never done that before. But it shows you there's a new deal
coming in. There's new thinking coming in. There's new strategy coming in.
It'll be Molotov cocktails this month, hand grenades next month, and
something else next month. It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets. It'll be
liberty, or it will be death. The only difference about this kind of death
-- it'll be reciprocal. You know what is meant by "reciprocal"? That's one
of Brother Lomax's words, I stole it from him. I don't usually deal with
those big words because I don't usually deal with big people. I deal with
small people. I find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell
out of a whole lot of big people. They haven't got anything to lose, and
they've got every thing to gain. And they'll let you know in a minute: "It
takes two to tango; when I go, you go."

[25] The black nationalists, those whose philosophy is black
nationalism, in
bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil
rights, look upon it as meaning, as Brother Lomax has pointed out, equality
of opportunity. Well, we're justified in seeking civil rights, if it means
equality of opportunity, because all we're doing there is trying to collect
for our investment. Our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood. Three
hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return --
I mean without a dime in return. You let the white man walk around here
talking about how rich this country is, but you never stop to think how it
got rich so quick. It got rich because you made it rich.

[26] You take the people who are in this audience right now. They're poor,
we're all poor as individuals. Our weekly salary individually amounts to
hardly anything. But if you take the salary of everyone in here
collectively
it'll fill up a whole lot of baskets. It's a lot of wealth. If you can
collect the wages of just these people right here for a year, you'll be
rich
-- richer than rich. When you look at it like that, think how rich Uncle
Sam
had to become, not with this handful, but millions of black people. Your
and
my mother and father, who didn't work an eight-hour shift, but worked from
"can't see" in the morning until "can't see" at night, and worked for
nothing, making the white man rich, making Uncle Sam rich.

[27] This is our investment. This is our contribution -- our blood. Not
only
did we give of our free labor, we gave of our blood. Every time he had a
call to arms, we were the first ones in uniform. We died on every
battlefield the white man had. We have made a greater sacrifice than
anybody
who's standing up in America today. We have made a greater contribution and
have collected less. Civil rights, for those of us whose philosophy is
black
nationalism, means: "Give it to us now. Don't wait for next year. Give
it to
us yesterday, and that's not fast enough."

[28] I might stop right here to point out one thing. When ever you're going
after something that belongs to you, anyone who's depriving you of the
right
to have it is a criminal. Understand that. Whenever you are going after
something that is yours, you are within your legal rights to lay claim to
it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is
yours, is breaking the law, is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the
Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation. Which means segregation is
against the law. Which means a segregationist is breaking the law. A
segregationist is a criminal. You can't label him as anything other than
that. And when you demonstrate against segregation, the law is on your
side.
The Supreme Court is on your side.

[29] Now, who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law? The police
department itself. With police dogs and clubs. Whenever you demonstrate
against segregation, whether it is segregated education, segregated
housing,
or anything else, the law is on your side, and anyone who stands in the way
is not the law any longer. They are breaking the law, they are not
representatives of the law. Any time you demonstrate against segregation
and
a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you, kill that dog, kill him,
I'm telling you, kill that dog. I say it, if they put me in jail tomorrow,
kill that dog. Then you'll put a stop to it. Now, if these white people in
here don't want to see that kind of action, get down and tell the mayor to
tell the police department to pull the dogs in. That's all you have to do.
If you don't do it, someone else will.

[30] If you don't take this kind of stand, your little children will
grow up
and look at you and think "shame." If you don't take an uncompromising
stand
-- I don't mean go out and get violent; but at the same time you should
never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence. I'm nonviolent
with those who are nonviolent with me. But when you drop that violence on
me, then you've made me go insane, and I'm not responsible for what I do.
And that's the way every Negro should get. Any time you know you're within
the law, within your legal rights, within your moral rights, in accord with
justice, then die for what you believe in. But don't die alone. Let your
dying be reciprocal. This is what is meant by equality. What's good for the
goose is good for the gander.

[31] When we begin to get in this area, we need new fiends, we need new
allies. We need to expand the civil-rights struggle to a higher level--to
the level of human rights. Whenever you are in a civil-rights struggle,
whether you know it or not, you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction
of Uncle Sam. No one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as
long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle. Civil rights comes within
the domestic affairs of this country. All of our African brothers and our
Asian brothers and our Latin-American brothers cannot open their mouths and
interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States. And as long as it's
civil rights, this comes under the jurisdiction of Uncle Sam.

[32] But the United Nations has what's known as the charter of human
rights,
it has a committee that deals in human rights. You may wonder why all of
the
atrocities that have been committed in Africa and in Hungary and in Asia
and
in Latin America are brought before the UN, and the Negro problem is never
brought before the UN. This is part of the conspiracy. This old,~ tricky,
blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend, supposed to be
in our corner, supposed to be subsidizing our struggle, and supposed to be
acting in the capacity of an adviser, never tells you anything about human
rights. They keep you wrapped up in civil rights. And you spend so much
time
barking up the civil-rights tree, you don't even know there's a
human-rights
tree on the same floor.

[33] When you expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human
rights,
you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the
nations in the UN. You can take it before the General Assembly. You can
take
Uncle Sam before a world court. But the only level you can do it on is the
level of human rights. Civil rights keeps you under his restrictions, under
his jurisdiction. Civil rights keeps you in his pocket. Civil rights means
you're asking Uncle Sam to treat you right. Human rights are some thing you
were born with. Human rights are your God given rights. Human rights are
the
rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth. And any time any
one violates your human rights, you can take them to the world court. Uncle
Sam's hands are dripping with blood, dripping with the blood of the black
man in this country. He's the earth's number-one hypocrite. He has the
audacity -- yes, he has -- imagine him posing as the leader of the free
world. The free world! And you over here singing "We Shall Overcome."
Expand
the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights, take it into the
United Nations, where our African brothers can throw their weight on our
side, where our Asian brothers can throw their weight on our side, where
our
Latin-American brothers can throw their weight on our side, and where 800
million Chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our
side.

[34] Let the world know how bloody his hands are. Let the world know the
hypocrisy that's practiced over here. Let it be the ballot or the bullet.
Let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet.

[35] When you take your case to Washington, D.C., you're taking it to the
criminal who's responsible; it's like running from the wolf to the fox.
They're all in cahoots together. They all work political chicanery and make
you look like a chump before the eyes of the world. Here you are walking
around in America, getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad, like a tin
soldier, and when you get over there, people ask you what are you fighting
for, and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek. No, take Uncle Sam to
court, take him before the world.

[36] By ballot I only mean freedom. Don't you know -- I disagree with Lomax
on this issue -- that the ballot is more important than the dollar? Can I
prove it? Yes. Look in the UN. There are poor nations in the UN; yet those
poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich
nations from making a move. They have one nation -- one vote, everyone has
an equal vote. And when those brothers from Asia, and Africa and the darker
parts of this earth get together, their voting power is sufficient to hold
Sam in check. Or Russia in check. Or some other section of the earth in
check. So, the ballot is most important.

[37] Right now, in this country, if you and I, 22 million African-Americans
-- that's what we are -- Africans who are in America. You're nothing but
Africans. Nothing but Africans. In fact, you'd get farther calling yourself
African instead of Negro. Africans don't catch hell. You're the only one
catching hell. They don't have to pass civil-rights bills for Africans. An
African can go anywhere he wants right now. All you've got to do is tie
your
head up. That's right, go anywhere you want. Just stop being a Negro.
Change
your name to Hoogagagooba. That'll show you how silly the white man is.
You're dealing with a silly man. A friend of mine who's very dark put a
turban on his head and went into a restaurant in Atlanta before they called
themselves desegregated. He went into a white restaurant, he sat down, they
served him, and he said, "What would happen if a Negro came in here? And
there he's sitting, black as night, but because he had his head wrapped up
the waitress looked back at him and says, "Why, there wouldn't no nigger
dare come in here."

[38] So, you're dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him
lose his mind, his intelligence, every day. He's frightened. He looks
around
and sees what's taking place on this earth, and he sees that the
pendulum of
time is swinging in your direction. The dark people are waking up. They're
losing their fear of the white man. No place where he's fighting right now
is he winning. Everywhere he's fighting, he's fighting someone your and my
complexion. And they're beating him. He can't win any more. He's won his
last battle. He failed to win the Korean War. He couldn't win it. He had to
sign a truce. That's a loss. Any time Uncle Sam, with all his machinery for
warfare, is held to a draw by some rice eaters, he's lost the battle. He
had
to sign a truce. America's not supposed to sign a truce. She's supposed to
be bad. But she's not bad any more. She's bad as long as she can use her
hydrogen bomb, but she can't use hers for fear Russia might use hers.
Russia
can't use hers, for fear that Sam might use his. So, both of them are
weapon
less. They can't use the weapon because each's weapon nullifies the
other's.
So the only place where action can take place is on the ground. And the
white man can't win another war fighting on the ground. Those days are over
The black man knows it, the brown man knows it, the red man knows it, and
the yellow man knows it. So they en gage him in guerrilla warfare. That's
not his style. You've got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior, and he
hasn't got any heart. I'm telling you now.

[39] I just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare
because,
before you know it, before you know it.... It takes heart to be a guerrilla
warrior because you're on your own. In conventional warfare you have tanks
and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up, planes over your
head and all that kind of stuff. But a guerrilla is on his own. All you
have
is a rifle, some sneakers and a bowl of rice, and that's all you need --
and
a lot of heart. The Japanese on some of those islands in the Pacific, when
the American soldiers landed, one Japanese sometimes could hold the whole
army off. He'd just wait until the sun went down, and when the sun went
down
they were all equal. He would take his little blade and slip from bush to
bush, and from American to American. The white soldiers couldn't cope with
that. Whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the Pacific, he has
the shakes, he has a nervous condition, because they scared him to death.

[40] The same thing happened to the French up in French Indochina. People
who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the
heavily-mechanized French army out of Indochina. You don't need it --
modern
warfare today won't work. This is the day of the guerrilla. They did the
same thing in Algeria. Algerians, who were nothing but Bedouins, took a
knife and sneaked off to the hills, and de Gaulle and all of his
highfalutin' war machinery couldn't defeat those guerrillas. Nowhere on
this
earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare. It's not his speed.
Just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in Asia and in parts of Africa and
in parts of Latin America, you've got to be mighty naive, or you've got to
play the black man cheap, if you don't think some day he's going to wake up
and find that it's got to be the ballot or the bullet.

[41] I would like to say, in closing, a few things concerning the Muslim
Mosque, Inc., which we established recently in New York City. It's true
we're Muslims and our religion is Islam, but we don't mix our religion with
our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities -- not
any more. We keep our religion in our mosque. After our religious services
are over, then as Muslims we become involved in political action, economic
action and social and civic action. We become involved with anybody, any
where, any time and in any manner that's designed to eliminate the evils,
the political, economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of
our community.

[42] The political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man
should control the politics and the politicians in his own community; no
more. The black man in the black community has to be re-educated into the
science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him
in return. Don't be throwing out any ballots. A ballot is like a bullet.
You
don't throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not
within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket. The political
philosophy
of black nationalism is being taught in the Christian church. It's being
taught in the NAACP. It's being taught in CORE meetings. It's being taught
in SNCC Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee meetings. It's being
taught in Muslim meetings. It's being taught where nothing but atheists and
agnostics come together. It's being taught everywhere. Black people are fed
up with the dillydallying, pussyfooting, compromising approach that we've
been using toward getting our freedom. We want freedom now, but we're not
going to get it saying "We Shall Overcome." We've got to fight until we
overcome.

[43] The economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple. It
only means that we should control the economy of our community. Why should
white people be running all the stores in our community? Why should white
people be running the banks of our community? Why should the economy of our
community be in the hands of the white man? Why? If a black man can't move
his store into a white community, you tell me why a white man should move
his store into a black community. The philosophy of black nationalism
involves a re-education program in the black community in regards to
economics. Our people have to be made to see that any time you take your
dollar out of your community and spend it in a community where you don't
live, the community where you live will get poorer and poorer, and the
community where you spend your money will get richer and richer. Then you
wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area. And where you
and I are concerned, not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the
community, but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied
up; so that though we spend it in the community, at sundown the man who
runs
the store takes it over across town somewhere. He's got us in a vise.

[44] So the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church,
in every civic organization, in every fraternal order, it's time now for
our
people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of
our community. If we own the stores, if we operate the businesses, if we
try
and establish some industry in our own community, then we're developing to
the position where we are creating employment for our own kind. Once you
gain control of the economy of your own community, then you don't have to
picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business.

[45] The social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to
get together and remove the evils, the vices, alcoholism, drug addiction,
and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community. We
our
selves have to lift the level of our community, the standard of our
community to a higher level, make our own society beautiful so that we will
be satisfied in our own social circles and won't be running around here
trying to knock our way into a social circle where we're not wanted.

[46] So I say, in spreading a gospel such as black nationalism, it is not
designed to make the black man re-evaluate the white man -- you know him
already -- but to make the black man re-evaluate himself. Don't change the
white man's mind -- you can't change his mind, and that whole thing about
appealing to the moral conscience of America -- America's conscience is
bankrupt. She lost all conscience a long time ago. Uncle Sam has no
conscience. They don't know what morals are. They don't try and
eliminate an
evil because it's evil, or because it's illegal, or because it's immoral;
they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence. So you're wasting
your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like Uncle
Sam. If he had a conscience, he'd straighten this thing out with no more
pressure being put upon him. So it is not necessary to change the white
man's mind. We have to change our own mind. You can't change his mind about
us. We've got to change our own minds about each other. We have to see each
other with new eyes. We have to see each other as brothers and sisters. We
have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony
that's
necessary to get this problem solved our selves. How can we do this? How
can
we avoid jealousy? How can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that
exist in the community? I'll tell you how.

[47] I have watched how Billy Graham comes into a city, spreading what he
calls the gospel of Christ, which is only white nationalism. That's what he
is. Billy Graham is a white nationalist; I'm a black nationalist. But since
it's the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a
powerful
figure like Graham with suspicion and envy, how is it possible for him to
come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders? Don't
think because they're church leaders that they don't have weaknesses that
make them envious and jealous -- no, everybody's got it. It's not an
accident that when they want to choose a cardinal as Pope over there in
Rome, they get in a closet so you can't hear them cussing and fighting and
carrying on.

[48] Billy Graham comes in preaching the gospel of Christ, he evangelizes
the gospel, he stirs everybody up, but he never tries to start a church. If
he came in trying to start a church, all the churches would be against him.
So, he just comes in talking about Christ and tells everybody who gets
Christ to go to any church where Christ is; and in this way the church
cooperates with him. So we're going to take a page from his book. Our
gospel
is black nationalism. We're not trying to threaten the existence of any
organization, but we're spreading the gospel of black nationalism. Anywhere
there's a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black
nationalism, join that church. If the NAACP is preaching and practicing the
gospel of black nationalism, join the NAACP. If CORE is spreading and
practicing the gospel of black nationalism, join CORE. Join any
organization
that has a gospel that's for the uplift of the black man. And when you get
into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising, pull out of it because
that's not black nationalism. We'll find another one.

[49] And in this manner, the organizations will increase in number and in
quantity and in quality, and by August, it is then our intention to have a
black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over
the country who are interested in the political, economic and social
philosophy of black nationalism. After these delegates convene, we will
hold
a seminar, we will hold discussions, we will listen to everyone. We want to
hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers. And at that time, if we
see fit then to form a black nationalist party, we'll form a black
nationalist party. If it's necessary to form a black nationalist army,
we'll
form a black nationalist army. It'll be the ballot or the bullet. It'll be
liberty or it'll be death.

[50] It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some
cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in
Washington, D.C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are
supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me
anything about my rights. Brothers and sisters, always remember, if it
doesn't take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to
give
freedom to the white man, it is not necessary for legislation or
proclamation or Supreme Court decisions to give freedom to the black man.
You let that white man know, if this is a country of freedom, let it be a
country of freedom; and if it's not a country of freedom, change it.

[51] We will work with anybody, anywhere, at any time, who is genuinely
interested in tackling the problem head-on, nonviolently as long as the
enemy is nonviolent, but violent when the enemy gets violent. We'll work
with you on the voter-registration drive, we'll work with you on rent
strikes, we'll work with you on school boycotts -- I don't believe in any
kind of integration; I'm not even worried about it because I know you're
not
going to get it anyway; you're not going to get it because you're afraid to
die; you've got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the
white man, because he'll get just as violent as those crackers in
Mississippi, right here in Cleveland. But we will still work with you on
the
school boycotts be cause we're against a segregated school system. A
segregated school system produces children who, when they graduate,
graduate
with crippled minds. But this does not mean that a school is segregated
because it's all black. A segregated school means a school that is
controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever.

[52] Let me explain what I mean. A segregated district or community is a
community in which people live, but outsiders control the politics and the
economy of that community. They never refer to the white section as a
segregated community. It's the all-Negro section that's a segregated
community. Why? The white man controls his own school, his own bank, his
own
economy, his own politics, his own everything, his own community -- but he
also controls yours. When you're under someone else's control, you're
segregated. They'll always give you the lowest or the worst that there
is to
offer, but it doesn't mean you're segregated just because you have your
own.
You've got to control your own. Just like the white man has control of his,
you need to control yours.

[53] You know the best way to get rid of segregation? The white man is more
afraid of separation than he is of integration. Segregation means that he
puts you away from him, but not far enough for you to be out of his
jurisdiction; separation means you're gone. And the white man will
integrate
faster than he'll let you separate. So we will work with you against t}~e
segregated school system because it's criminal, because it is absolutely
destructive, in every way imaginable, to the minds of the children who have
to be exposed to that type of crippling education. Last but not least, I
must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns.
The
only thing that I've ever said is that in areas where the government has
proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the
property of Negroes, it's time for Negroes to defend themselves. Article
number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the
right to
own a rifle or a shotgun. It is constitutionally legal to own a shotgun
or a
rifle. This doesn't mean you're going to get a rifle and form battalions
and
go out looking for white folks, although you'd be within your rights -- I
mean, you'd be justified; but that would be illegal and we don't do
anything
illegal. If the white man doesn't want the black man buying rifles and
shotguns, then let the government do its job. That's all. And don't let the
white man come to you and ask you what you think about what Malcolm says --
why, you old Uncle Tom. He would never ask you if he thought you were going
to say, "Amen!" No, he is making a Tom out of you." So, this doesn't mean
forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people, but it is time, in
1964, if you are a man, to let that man know. If he's not going to do his
job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection
that our taxes are supposed to be for, since he spends all those billions
for his defense budget, he certainly can't begrudge you and me spending $12
or $15 for a single-shot, or double-action. I hope you under stand.
Don't go
out shooting people, but any time, brothers and sisters, and especially the
men in this audience -- some of you wearing Congressional Medals of Honor,
with shoulders this wide, chests this big, muscles that big -- any time you
and I sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold
blood,
not some grownups, but four little girls while they were praying to the
same
god the white man taught them to pray to, and you and I see the government
go down and can't find who did it. Why, this man -- he can find Eichmann
hiding down in Argentina somewhere. Let two or three American soldiers, who
are minding somebody else's business way over in South Vietnam, get killed,
and he'll send battleships, sticking his nose in their business. He wanted
to send troops down to Cuba and make them have what he calls free elections
-- this old cracker who doesn't have free elections in his own country. No,
if you never see me another time in your life, if I die in the morning,
I'll
die saying one thing: the ballot or the bullet, the ballot or the bullet.

[54] If a Negro in 1964 has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator
to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people, why, you and I
should hang our heads in shame. You talk about a march on Washington in
1963, you haven't seen anything. There's some more going down in '64. And
this time they're not going like they went last year. They're not going
singing ''We Shall Overcome." They're not going with white friends. They're
not going with placards already painted for them. They're not going with
round-trip tickets. They're going with one way tickets.

[55] And if they don't want that non-nonviolent army going down there, tell
them to bring the filibuster to a halt. The black nationalists aren't going
to wait. Lyndon B. Johnson is the head of the Democratic Party. If he's for
civil rights, let him go into the Senate next week and declare himself. Let
him go in there right now and declare himself. Let him go in there and
denounce the Southern branch of his party. Let him go in there right now
and
take a moral stand -- right now, not later. Tell him, don't wait until
election time. If he waits too long, brothers and sisters, he will be
responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will
create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation
on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of. In
1964, it's the ballot or the bullet. Thank you.

Woke up nauseous this morning - a loss of equilibrium - wobbling about
("passive" indeed). Realized - at least what felt like what was going on -
was something akin to another version of 9-11. This time around, however,
feels like a massive attack on the twin-towers of the country's imagination
- including everything of value to so many of us who have variously fought
against the war in Viet-Nam, for the environment, civil rights (women,
ethnic, gay), working conditions - and each of us who have committed our
lives to making and presenting poetry and art in multiple ways.  Not to
suggest that any of this has led to some utopia, but a highly charge ground
has been defined in which all the various arguments have a place in the
national debate.

The election does not eliminate that ground - nor all the energy and
organization that went into the fight. And I don't think we're jumping out
of buildings or in ashes. Instead of suicides in planes, however, the
perpetrators are fully in power, "mandated", etc. and do feel entitled to
redefine and limit the ground upon which we all live.

This - working our way through it - is going to take real work and smarts.

I think we do have a few more days on the gurney - before getting recharged.
Passive,yes, for the moment. But, heah, most trees survive major storms
and/or get reborn through their seeds from devastating fires.

Feeling very depressed yesterday afternoon -- in
shock, really -- I attended a screening of the
original Manchurian Candidate at our beautiful
Castro Theater. I happened to run into local
filmmaker konrad steiner who had come for similar
reasons, and we sat together, laughing in the dark
at the dark humor of the brilliant script. I was
struck in particular by how incredibly bleak the
film is, something that does not translate on
video but comes across in huge fugue-like tones on
the silver screen; konrad pointed out that the
lack of a soundtrack forces that bleakness into
the foreground. The climactic scene -- when the
foppish, McCarthyesque Senator Iceland is about to
swoop in for his Kodak moment at the RNC -- was
filmed in Madison Square Garden. I couldn't help
remembering that Bush accepted his party's
nomination there just a couple months ago.

Part of the reason I went to the film is that I
miss guys like Frank Sinatra, at least the
character he played in this film. Someone who's
strong but connects with people on an emotional
level and is on the side of good. The anti-Bush.
Reading Vernon's comment "over time writing can
change human sensibilities" I think also of Woody
Guthrie in this vein. The thought of him
barnstorming the country performing for unions and
workers and the poor reminds me of a time when
"our side" did connect with those people on a
strong, emotional level. We've lost that edge;
now the working poor coming into this country have
roots in the same dubious "values" to which Karl
Rove so presciently appealed.

I don't have the answer to this, except to say
that there's a tough row to hoe ahead. Maybe the
next heroes and heroines are already among us,
getting ready to do some good, and if so,
Godspeed.

Yes, it is a time for making poems. I'm bummed out

On a slightly separate note [to my previous post,
but also in response to this], I've been wondering
for a long time just how effective poetry can be,
at least as it's practiced today. Spicer's "nobody
listens to poetry" has never been more true, and
that's due at least as much to the failure of our
culture as it is to poetry's failure to hold the
culture's attention -- at least it seems so to me.
The background is lost, even among most poets I
know. How many of us can legitimately say that we
have a stronger grasp of poetry  -- I'm talking
large chunks of ancient and modern verse committed
so deeply to memory that it is "part of our
gesture and blood" -- than we do of popular film
and/or music. Not me. Almost everyone can quote
you song lyrics or lines from their favorite
films, but not many (outside of those in theater)
can give long sections of Shakespeare.

In a sense, the rarity of poetry has made it all
the more valuable when encountered in public
space. But is it effective? Maybe "over time"? I'm
sincerely asking this. Even Keats wondered if it
was nothing but a "jack o lantern" throwing pretty
images at the imagination. This is part of the
reason I've spent the last year learning to play
guitar. Well there is much to say about this and I
look forward to other thoughts. but back to
work...

Searing alto saxophonist Gary Bartz will team up with the renowned
writer and iconoclast Ishmael Reed in a "Poetry for Peace" performance
on Saturday Nov. 6 from 8 p.m. at on the Boards/the Behnke Center for
Contemporary Performances in Seattle as part of the Earshot Jazz
Festival.

Ishmael Reed, one of the most original and controversial African
American literary figures, will read his own works and the peace poetry
of Japanese Buddhist philosopher Daisaku Ikeda in what promises to be a
powerful collaboration between music and performed poetry. As Reed says,
"When the politicians and the intellectual or academic leaders fail,
then the poets have to step in. Plato and other people were frightened
of the poets because they say what's on their mind. They speak from the
soul."

Seattle arts writer Bill White has selected the event as one of his top
five "picks" of the festival, which brings together top musicians from
around the world for a marathon celebration of more than 55 events over
a three-week period.

Bartz is known for his focused passion and lyricism, from his early work
with Charles Mingus, Max Roach, Art Blakey and Miles Davis's fusion
band, to his own blend of jazz, soul, African rhythms and funk. Gene
Kalbacher of Hot House jazz magazine has called him "arguably the most
soulfully expressive altoist on the scene." Also known for his strong
political convictions, Bartz has long appreciated the synergy between
jazz and poetry. His acclaimed 1973 album "I've Known Rivers" was based
on the poetry of Langston Hughes. His quartet on Saturday features
Barney McCall on piano and keyboards, James King on bass and Greg Bandy
on drums.

Reed will be reciting poetry from Fighting for Peace by Japanese
Buddhist philosopher and peacebuilder, Daisaku Ikeda. In the book's
foreword Reed comments: "One doesn't have to be a follower of the
Buddhist religion to appreciate the universal appeal of Fighting for
Peace... (Ikeda) speaks for millions of people who have become
frustrated with the lethal shenanigans of the world's politicians..."

Ikeda is the president of the Soka Gakkai International, a lay Buddhist
association dedicated to peace, education and cultural exchange, and has
been named poet laureate by the World Academy of Arts and Culture. For
further information about the event, go to

Poet James Koller has also published three novels and numerous essays.
His writing has been translated into Italian, French, German, Dutch and
Swedish, and he has translated the work of others from French into
English. He began performing in the US in 1959, & continues since the
late '70s to appear widely in western Europe. He and the late Franco
Beltrametti performed their Graffiti Lyriques, which incorporated
painting, reading and music, from Bologna to Stockholm 1987-89, and in
the United States, where the two began making cross-country tours in
1977. Since 1989 Koller has also toured the United States and Europe and
recorded with American musician/songwriter Karl Bruder. In 2003 he
toured the US with German poet Stefan Hyner. Editor of Coyote's Journal
& Coyote Books since 1964, Koller edited the book review Otherwise
1994-97. He explored "context in writing" in a course on the Icelandic
sagas he taught with Stefan Hyner & Reidar Ekner in B i Telemark,
Norway, 2001. He remains active as well as an artist and photographer.

Born in Illinois, Koller spent his first thirty-six years in the
American midwest and west. In 1972 he moved to Maine. He is married &
the father of six.

Michael Rothenberg and David Meltzer read from their new books from La
Alameda / University New Mexico

"Unhurried Vision" by Michael Rothenberg

Underneath the art of poetry exists the tradition of the journal - the
attempt to capture and reveal the world as it passes by. Observations,
reflections, and ideas accumulate to form connections and reveal
process, content and story. Unhurried Vision is a record of the year
1999, and continues Michael Rothenberg's experiment with the journal.
This is the year Philip Whalen became terminally ill and Rothenberg
began taking care of him, pulled together Whalen's archives and library
and edited his book of selected poems, Overtime. Political, personal,
and romantic, Unhurried Vision works to savor the impermanent, looking
at the moments in a poet's life, contemplating the body of experience.
It is the mind on a quiet stroll through longing, loss and beauty.

During the late 1950s, David Meltzer was an active poet in the San
Francisco North Beach scene often reading with jazz musicians at various
bars and coffeehouses. Beat Thing is part poetry and part expos, both
tribute to the down in the street wildness and rant against the romantic
commodification which surrounds the Beat Generation. Invoking real
people as real history, Meltzer takes aim at the fantasy which Beat has
become and juxtaposes simultaneously its still-needed legacy. He brings
forth the original spirit of Beat in a encyclopedic cascade of details
whose dense, deep, fierce, funny, raucous, free-associative jazz energy
infuses every line. This is a grizzled hipster vision looking back at a
period where the beast of war from Auschwitz to H-bomb to Joe McCarthy
prevailed side-by-side with a cultural complacency while a wide-ranging
constellation of writers and artists refused its numbing protocol. Beat
Thing rises up as an ecstatic chant of defiance and celebration.

David Meltzer is the author of many volumes of poetry, including The
Clown (Semina, 1960), The Process (Oyez, l965), Yesod (Trigram, l969),
Arrows: Selected Poetry, 1957-1992 (Black Sparrow Press, 1994), and No
Eyes: Lester Young (Black Sparrow, 2000). He has also published fiction,
including The Agency Trilogy (Brandon House, l968; reprinted by Richard
Kasak, 1994), Orf (Brandon House, l969; reprinted by Masquerade Books,
l995), Under (Rhinoceros Books, 1997), and book-length essays, including
Two-Way Mirror: A Poetry Notebook (Oyez, 1977). He has edited numerous
anthologies and collections of interviews, including The Secret Garden:
An Anthology in the Kabbalah (Continuum Press, 1976; reprinted, Station
Hill Press, 1998), Birth: Anthology of Ancients Texts, Songs, Prayers,
and Stories (North Point Press, 1981), Death: Anthology of Texts, Songs,
Charms, Prayers, and Tales (North Point Press, 1984), Reading Jazz
(Mercury House, 1996), Writing Jazz (Mercury House, 1999), and San
Francisco Beat: Talking With the Poets (City Lights, 2001). His musical
recordings include Serpent Power (Vanguard Records, l968; reissued on CD
in 1996) and Poet Song (Vanguard Records, l969). He teaches in the
Humanities and graduate Poetics programs at the New College of
California. He lives in the Bay Area.

I never find it hard to write poetry, I do find it hard to read it. I think it has to dowith doing it so much, either in my head or in practice, and then everyday life has a way of being (or becoming) a big poem, and then there are fake pomes, or the fake poems of usual life. I think SPicer;s comment is sort of permanent but limited in a permanent way. in fact you could say the opposite that everyone listens to poetry today more than ever... I suppose in the end it does not matter, what matters is doing it.

On a slightly separate note [to my previous post,
but also in response to this], I've been wondering
for a long time just how effective poetry can be,
at least as it's practiced today. Spicer's "nobody
listens to poetry" has never been more true, and
that's due at least as much to the failure of our
culture as it is to poetry's failure to hold the
culture's attention -- at least it seems so to me.
The background is lost, even among most poets I
know. How many of us can legitimately say that we
have a stronger grasp of poetry -- I'm talking
large chunks of ancient and modern verse committed
so deeply to memory that it is "part of our
gesture and blood" -- than we do of popular film
and/or music. Not me. Almost everyone can quote
you song lyrics or lines from their favorite
films, but not many (outside of those in theater)
can give long sections of Shakespeare.

In a sense, the rarity of poetry has made it all
the more valuable when encountered in public
space. But is it effective? Maybe "over time"? I'm
sincerely asking this. Even Keats wondered if it
was nothing but a "jack o lantern" throwing pretty
images at the imagination. This is part of the
reason I've spent the last year learning to play
guitar. Well there is much to say about this and I
look forward to other thoughts. but back to
work...

With 40 million actual votes unverifiable due to electronic voting with
no paper trail, the 2004 presidential election is quite possibly a load
of bullshit.  Yes, 40 million of the total votes were from e-vote
machines.

You can see the spread of electronic voting here:
http://verifiedvoting.org/verifier/index.php?topic_string=3D5estd.  And =
in
your backyard:
http://verifiedvoting.org/verifier/map.php?&topic_string=3D5estd&state=3D=
Nor
th%20Carolina.

Sounds like a predictable response from me, I know.  Slate has already
dismissed my argument as "conspiracy-minded."  You know me, I'm so
predictable.  We *reasonable* people all know there's no such thing as a
conspiracy.  Right?  But bear with me.  And ask yourself, am I really
being irrational?  I fully realize I sound loony by merely suggesting
any wrongdoing.  But is my skepticism truly groundless? =20

The results in Florida weren't close as we all know.  That gap (52% to
47% in favor of Bush) we are told is supposed to suggest there was not a
sufficient amount of wrongdoing there to swing the election.  I cannot
help but wonder, however, about the validity of those results when 50%
of votes passed through e-vote machines in that state.  50% of the
Florida vote is completely unverifiable and run completely by Republican
partisan interests who benefit from trade law protections.  50% of the
votes might as well be imaginary votes.  Ohio had unverifiable e-voting
in a sufficient number of precincts representing a sufficient number of
votes to change the outcome.   OK I'm speculating it seems, but do I
have any evidence to even make such a suggestion?

The first piece of evidence is prior probability.  We know that there
have been massive problems with the machines.  We have a paper trail of
documented problems.  Those problems have been demonstrated over and
over and over again, but the courts won't have any of it.  The prior
probability shows a fix is likely. =20

For example, we saw massive problems and wrongdoings by the Bushies in
Florida in 2000, and that wrongdoing ultimately decided the election.

Another example--the Republican candidate for Georgia's governorship won
the 2002 election when polls indicated that his Democratic opponent was
likely to beat him by a margin of 9 to 11 points.  In the same year, a
Republican candidate for Senator defeated his Democratic opponent, even
though the Dem was expected to win by a 2 to 5 point margin.  The
combination of these two results are, statistically speaking,
astronomically unlikely.  In 2002, Georgia became the first state in the
U.S. to use computerized touch-screen voting machines in all of its
election districts.  Georgia's votes were not counted by state election
officials but were instead counted by employees of the corporation that
manufactured and programmed the computerized voting machines. Those
machines produced no paper voting records or any other means to verify
the vote.  What happened in Georgia was not unique to the 2002
elections. Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, and New Hampshire also
experienced unusual last-minute swings in some of their election
districts, but only in the ones that used electronic voting machines.
Interestingly, those sudden and unexpected swings only occurred in hotly
contested districts, and in each case, the underdog who won was a
Republican.

Sequoia Voting Systems software was discovered by hackers and found to
be full of vulnerabilities.  Those of you who are savvy enough can have
a look at the code here:
http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~tarantul/WinEDS200.zip

The second piece of evidence is the combination of bias & motive.  CEOs,
founders and owners of Diebold and ES&S are either big shot Republican
fundraisers (Diebold) or Republican Senators who have already won
suspect elections from their very own machines (Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Nebraska). In August, 2003, Diebold CEO Walden O'Dell wrote a letter
to Ohio Republicans in which he said he was "committed to helping Ohio
to deliver its electoral votes to the president next year." He wrote
this letter at the very time Diebold was bidding for a contract to sell
its voting machines to the state of Ohio.  What=92s more, even after
O'Dell's letter was exposed to the public, Ohio's Secretary of State,
Ken Blackwell--who happens to be a Republican & who also attempted to
deny delivery of provisional ballots across Ohio--had the audacity to
put Diebold on Ohio's list of preferred voting machine vendors.
Diebold's machines were used in Ohio's presidential election Tuesday.
Chuck Hagel, the head of ES&S, sold his company's voting machines to the
state of Nebraska. Shortly after that he became Nebraska's first
Republican Senator in 24 years. Eighty percent of Hagel's votes were
counted by ES&S employees in complete corporate secrecy. =20

The third piece of evidence: the exit poll results in Florida.  The
biggest problem is precision, something that cannot be verified.  We can
only look to exit polls to see if the election outcome was reasonable.
In Ohio the exit polls were not inconsistent with the final tally, yet
in Florida the outcome was HIGHLY unlikely given their exit polls.
(http://synapse.princeton.edu/~sam/poll-discrepancy-z-scores.jpg)

Without a paper trail, a recount cannot be conducted.  If official
Florida results showed a close race, a recount would have been a legal
nightmare that would have eclipsed what happened in 2000.  *The bigger
the lie, the more people believe.*  The margin in Florida was too great
for a recount.  Was this a matter of convenience?

The fourth piece of evidence: the demographics of increased voter
turnout.  Typically in a presidential election, lefty voters show a
greater increase in turnout than Republican  It's as if, in this
election, the majority of anti-Bush newly turned-out voters across the
nation voted for Bush.  Hmm.  This is a piece of evidence, admittedly,
that has yet to materialize.  The massive increase in voter
registrations since 2000 were primarily Democrat, but Rove & Co. built
an impressive 72-hour get-out-the-Bush-vote grassroots campaign,
designed to contact all unlikely Republican voters three times in 72
hours, one interpersonal.  In the coming says we should be able to get
the statistics, however, and know whether there is something here in the
increased turnout. =20

Finally, there is no evidence to the contrary, that electronic voting
was not biased.  There is no way that contrary evidence can be
demonstrated.  In fact, it's illegal to demonstrate such validity.

40 million electronic votes.  Poof.  Just like that.  Out comes a
president.

Let's face it.  We know the Republicans represent a kleptocracy.  We
know they are willing to lie and deceive 24-7 in order to steal more.
We know they are looting the wealthiest nation in history.  We know.  We
know.  Ask yourself: especially given the slightest of evidence, do you
put this past them?  This election was in the bag for Kerry with a major
underestimation of turnout.  And when we see things like this
(http://tinyurl.com/3t3cr) you just have to wonder....

Coups typically use the power of the existing government for its own
takeover. As renowned economist, historian, and leading military
strategy consultant Edward Luttwak remarks in his book _Coup d'=E9tat: A
practical handbook_, a book translated into 14 languages: "A coup
consists of the infiltration of a small but critical segment of the
state apparatus, which is then used to displace the government from its
control of the remainder." Use of military or other organized force is
not the defining feature of a coup d'=E9tat. Any seizure of the state
apparatus by extra-legal tactics may be considered a coup, according to
Luttwak.

Ultimately few in the government are fighting for your right to vote.
Edwards reportedly encouraged Kerry to continue to count in Ohio, but
Kerry opted for "unity."  We can be sure Bush will not go centrist on
us.  Meanwhile, the media proliferate their claims that e-voting was a
success--because, they say, no widespread problems were reported.
Without a trail, what's there to report?

We on the left, we were gutless Tuesday night when things looked bad.
We stopped watching and gave up hope well before Ohio was settled.  We
gave up, citing that America is on the whole homophobic, misogynist,
stupid.  Many of us are now wringing our hands, citing secession or
leaving the country altogether.  A lot of America is stupid, homophobic,
misogynist, but the election in no way proves the majority is.  40
million votes.  Vaporware.=20

Alas, there is absolutely nothing we can do to change this election.
Nothing.  We can't go back and count those votes--they are not there to
be counted.  Gone.  Our legislature has failed to protect us, because we
have failed to insist on it.

So we can't do much now.  It's too late.  But what can we do about the
next election?  Based on this election, we can anticipate that the fight
to force states to make sure a paper trail is created from electronic
voting machines will fade.  But that fight must continue.

So yeah, my entire argument could be wrong, but doesn't it make you
wonder just a little bit?  We don't have the 40 million votes needed to
ultimately substantiate or reject my argument.  That should make you
very nervous, very concerned.

Be rest assured, no one can be sure that Bush has the mandate of the
masses.  The sound of confidence in such a claim is nothing but noise.
Fear not.

So don=92t give up on America.  Protect your right to vote.  You can =
fight
for election paper trails, and fight for validation of electronic voting
regardless of the margin of outcome between candidates.  You can start
by fighting for H.R.2239 and S.1980, stalled bills which would amend the
Help America Vote Act of 2002 by requiring a voter-verified permanent
record or hardcopy of all electronic votes.  You can also educate
yourself about the problems of electronic voting and educate others.  Or
if you've the stomach for it, you can also practice civil disobedience:
find those electronic machines, drag 'em out, pull 'em apart, and find
out how they work.

Aaron, et al,

I agree. Of course politics cannot be reduced down to
linguistic/philosophical analyses. We're dealing with real, i.e. =
material,
issues here, real lives, real jobs, real freedoms are at stake here. =
That's
why the outlook of another 4 years, what with the possibility of up to 4
Supreme Court appointments coming up for grabs, makes me very very =
afraid.

I too feel bitter about this entrenched corporatized two-party system, =
where
only millionaires can afford to run for office, where third-party =
candidates
are barred from the nationally televised debates. That needs to change. =
I
feel some rancor too about Nadar not sticking with the Green party this =
time
around, I mean, if we want to promote a multi-party system we at least =
need
to start developing loyalty to our third parties, don't we? In 2000 the
Greens looked like they were going to be a really viable organized party
beyond the Dems and the Repubs, especially on the national scale with =
Nadar's
high profile. Now it looks like a lot of people were just attracted to =
Nadar
as an individual candidate, and not so much to the Green party platform.

I still have high hopes that the Greens will continue to gain political
power, starting from the grassroots level on up. We need more Green (and
other minority party) members on school boards, city councils, boards of
supervisors, as mayors, state legislators, governors, and then...?

At the same time, for fear of fragmenting the Left, I wish some of the =
Repub
party base would split off and form a conservative third party that =
fragments
the Right. Besides the anti-govt. conservative liberatarians, we could =
have
the ultra-Christian theocrats jumping ship and draining the vote. Well, =
at
least I can fantasize about this. That would only be a likely scenario =
if
John McCain somehow started calling all the shots in the Repub party...

Back to the language thing. If you read Lakoff carefully, his is *not* a
facile ivory tower argument. He outlines how the neocon movement has =
poured
millions of dollars during the 40 odd years since Goldwater into =
conservative
think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute, and into =
conservative
network funds that seek to attract and retain bright young conservatives =
and
help them into key positions of power in the academy and the media =
industry.
Sound like a conspiracy? Well, it was just smart organizing. As a =
result, the
conservatives managed to build a coalition out of what was once a =
splintered
Repub party base.

Lakoff's point is that the conservatives worded their platform points =
into a
successful rhetoric that strongly won over the Christian evangelical =
base,
which as group may not actually be wealthy and may in fact be voting =
against
their own economic self-interest by supporting tax breaks for the rich. =
The
logical argument here takes a back seat to the emotional appeal to =
"moral
values" or whatever you want to call it, but this is not to say the =
people
are just empty droids ready to absorb whatever their leaders tell them. =
They
absorb these ideas, these rhetorical calls on behalf of "morality", =
because
these ideas actually do resonate with some emotional core of familiarity =
and
personal conviction. Lakoff's theory is that this conviction is not only =
a
religious one, but a deep-seated values-based one, which speaks to
fundamental differences between how conservatives and liberals view the
world, view human nature, and the roles/responsibilities of humans in =
the
world.

Lakoff's appeal to liberals is that they take this moral values issue, =
and
the emotions it registers in voters, seriously, because it could be the =
key
to what makes swing voters swing in the first place. In a lot of ways I
subscribe to his argument because I subscribe to the idea that election
campaigns are more and more about turning over this percentage of swing
voters, because that's the pivotal factor. So campaigns have to be =
fought on
several fronts at once: 1) Mobilize the loyal party base, get them =
interested
in volunteering, spreading the word; 2) Win the national debate on =
issues,
outlining the many reasons why the Dem platform is better for people, =
social
justice, the environment, and the nation in general; AND 3) Turn over =
enough
swing voters by appealing to their sense of deep-seated values, *not* =
their
conservative-based values but their *liberal-based* values, because the =
idea
is that the swing voter (what I guess I'm calling the "passive" voter) =
has
*both* sets of values, liberal and conservative, in their personal =
makeup.
This third front is where campaign language becomes very very important.

Anyhow, this is a topic to think about for the long term, for the =
long-term
future of the liberal coalition and the country in general. In a way I =
just
want to put in plug in there for Lakoff because I feel he's really done =
his
homework and is really on to something in my opinion.

A assorted handful of cents:

On the reds and the blues-- I just want to affirm Chris Stroffolino's =
post
about the alienation between the red and blue states, and about how us =
blue
types can't just take the I'm-above-it-all elite city slicker stance =
forever
against the red yokels and expect things to change. We have to take the =
other
side seriously, learn how the enemy thinks the way it does and why. In
response to the 11 anti-gay initiatives that passed across the states, I
predict that gay producer moguls in Hollywood will start coming out with
sentimental Hallmark-style melodramas about the travails of mainstream =
gay
couples and their children -- instead of Will & Grace bouncing around =
the gay
ghetto, we'll have Willie and Mike on some couch somewhere in a =
midwestern
suburb or even small town, shopping at the WalMart back-to-school sale =
for
their adopted, possibly multiracial children, enduring slurs and attacks =
and
nasty remarks from the conservative town baddies but also getting =
supportive
hugs, kind words, and friendly go-get-'em punches on the shoulder from
open-minded supermarket checkout clerks and Seventh-Heaven-style =
progressive
social justice pastors. On the next election day, swing voters in red =
states,
especially the female ones, will gaze at the anti-gay initiative set =
before
them on the ballot, think back on cinematic memories of what poor sweet
Willie had to endure just to have a family life like everyone else, and
tearfully punch through the "No" square on the scorecard, leaving it
chadless...

On passive morality and voting-- I guess when I use the term "passive" =
to
describe a voter, this is what I mean: I have essentially been a passive
voter myself in the past, when it comes to ballot initiatives and
propositions. In California we literally have a dozen or more of these
propositions to decide on each election. This time round, I was an =
"active"
actually read my information pamphlet pretty thoroughly beforehand. My
partner and I spent a good Saturday reading through all the summaries, =
the
arguments pro and con, the rebuttals to the arguments pro and con, and =
we
talked through the ones we felt iffy on. Where I felt iffy on a =
proposition,
I categorize myself as essentially a "swing voter" on that proposition. =
So
she and I debated over the iffy ones and sometimes I convinced her to my
side, or she convinced me to her side. Sometimes we were left on =
opposite
sides and our votes cancelled each other out. Sometimes we both =
convinced
each other to our sides and wound up with diametrically switched =
positions
from where we started. I actually agonized over a couple of them and =
spent
election day morning rereading arguments and articles, and switched my
position on two propositions minutes before entering the polling booth. =
And
that was after an "active" approach!

Now what would I have done in a "passive" approach? In the past, I would =
have
blown off the big thick voter info pamphlet with its one or more
supplementary bulletins. I would have clipped out a couple of =
endorsement
pages that *felt socially and ideologically familiar* to me, which in =
this
case would have been the Dem party grid and the endorsement page of my =
local
left-leaning muckraking urban weekly. I would have gone down the column =
in
about 5 minutes matching my votes, where the two endorsement tables =
differed
I would have deferred to the weekly's. Presto. Done. I would have been a
swing voter who had been captured by one or another camp *passively*.

On families and counterculture-- Seems to me that even in =
countercultural
communities that are actively not centered around or even actively =
opposed to
the conventional biological notion of "family", the relationship =
dynamics
that get played out are still in fact modelled psychologically after the
countercultural individuals' idea or memory of their biological =
families. And
we have the contemporary urban notion of the "family" or community you =
choose
versus the one you're afflicted with, as when gay people of my =
generation
give each other high fives and exclaim "hey, you're family!" We need to
expand the term "family" so that it's about emotional support and =
security
and solidarity, not just biology.

On good and evil in the hearts of humanity-- I grew up in a highly =
intolerant
part of California, so when I was younger I believed that many people =
around
me had malevolence and hostility in their hearts and were out to get me. =
I
was right. Some of these people were active in their malevolence, and =
some
were more passive. It was a continuum of intolerance. As I get older I =
have
less of this feeling in general. This isn't so much a function of age =
but of
changing times. When I go back and visit my hometown I find it to be
dramatically less intolerant (this is not to say that it's actually
*tolerant*!). But things like social attitudes, especially among the =
young,
have really shifted over the years, and the continuum of intolerance has
basically lost a lot of its passive members. This is due in part to some
large and widespread changes in social opinion nationwide. And I think =
that's
why reactionary movements like the Christian Right have such a jarring =
impact
and appearance -- they stand out, because they are moving against the =
social
tide that's been progressing ever since the civil rights movement.

So I say, get 'em when they're young. Send coalitions of liberal =
Christians
out to the moderate churches and college campuses to get the young =
Christians
mobilized to the progressive side, before the Right tries to sweep them =
over
with manipulative claims of a "populist conservative revolution". =
Mobilize
the young.

Best,
Pam

This is the first honest reaction to the election. No excuses, no what one=20
should have done. Religion apparently is the key political power in the glob=

capitalist world. Ironically, the only force countering the power of money a=

I had felt this force writing the Turkish "Eda" anthology. Eda, it seems, is=

Today I went to my Chinese barely English speaking genius,

rarely visited, herbalist to get treated for a scary, nocturnal loss of

equilibrium - i.e. dizzy & about to fall down when I get out of bed to walk=
.

=B3Ear,=B2 he says and takes my pulse.

"And George Bush?" I ask.

"Yes. George Bush. So many people sick come here this week. Dizzy, too.

George Bush," he laughs, "It is.=B2

Seven days of bitter teas - so beautiful in the raw: mushrooms, flowers,

more fungi -multiple colors - including a hard green-white thistle burr -

the kind you never want in your hiking sock. "That one," he says, "stops th=
e

dizzy."

Illness and thistle burrs as national metaphor? Dizzy - vertigo - where in

God's name - so to speak - are we - this country - about to drop?

Shut-up, boil the herbs and drink the tea!

Argh!

Mending the week (weak??!!)

The picture of Kerry hunting made me feel sick, as did his harping on the
Vietnam War. The salute, the hero stuff--one becomes a hero by killing "the
enemy"--didn't work. In the end, he became anyone he thought would give him
a vote. He lost because he didn't have faith in what he believed.

Thus: We need a progressive coalition that, like the conservatives, has a
clear view of itself.  We need to know what we want our country to be before
we can move it that way. We need progressive think tanks, and more media. We
need to recapture the language from the manipulative self-serving lies of
the Right. We need to move religion away from petty moralisms, from
suppression of the Other, toward the reality of an environment-based
present, which is always progressive. We need to plant deeper than a
chainsaw can reach.

“One Future That Binds Us.”

In the fat October, all we needed were kitchen
staples:  soap and ash, mostly.  Then flour, back
bacon, butter and eggs.  We were hopeful. We wore gray
wigs. We played pool and practiced signing our names
with feathered pins on fancy sheepskins. We were onto
something big.  Next stop—the place they keep the
buffalo.  Those grazing lands look nice. We were
carried here by men with heavy wings.

*

A pile of shit (a “fortunate mistake” of a book of
verses) and a thin brown-haired, flat-chested girl
sustained me through my banquet years and gave me
reams and sheafs of freshly-printed, ink still wet,
smelling like a good book material for my puritan
fantasies—you ease my troubles, that’s what you do. I
sent eleven photographs; you didn’t respond. Take away
my sadness, you feel my heart with gladness. That’s
what you do.

*

Pushed in as far as it would go and hit
something—bump—it’s okay, it’s only a gopher. Always
one with the image. The bedroom smelled of lilacs and
cheap incense. Girlwatching but only one girl to watch
and the pillow stained with cigarette smoke. When I
was ten the Secretary of the Interior crushed puppies
and flowers. Pillows looked like yr teeth & there’s a
reason the round vowels went missing.  Pick up your
clothes, take the back door out.

*

Smoking with you. Whiskey in a Mason jar.  Why are all
your friends gay?  What’s the matter with me. Why does
your cat piss on the art print wedding presents. Is it
because we’re too high, too high to give up our
frequent flier miles to the citizenry less competent?
In the country, they’re called Pagans. Here we just
say, “faggots.” Let not be torn asunder that which
hath been hastily glued together and covered with
pretty glitter.

*

I’m becoming experimental all over your back.  I’ve
done it twice. Sulfur lamps are keeping me up all
night.  Green banker’s lamps lend an avocado pallor to
my naked thigh.  There’s a rush and a thrush.  A bird
and a directive. The circles under my eyes make me
look Lebanese.  I’m fixing to defect.

*

A primer, a hornbook.  A schoolmarm getup pasted next
to a german paper doll. When the man dressed as the
harem attendant eunuched his way up the walk, I could
only think of America’s magical heartland.  Chicken
fried steak and mashed taters.  Ropes tightly coiled,
swinging like children in dresses and saddle shoes.

*

Banishing me will do no good. As a child, we’d scream
“I’m a banshee!” and it meant something shameful.
Something we’ll never do again. (We cast black stones
and white stones.) When we kissed we meant it, just
not for very long.

*

All this pornography is giving me a collarbone.  The
color of hamhocks and the best American pies.  A
travel pamphlet up the wazoo.  A ride to the top of
the arch.  Bicyclists pedaling through Iowa prefer
breakfast burritos and loose meats.  I’m verily
trouncing my own regulations, yea.  What I meant was,
you can’t do it.

*

It’s unconscionable, this outcome.  It’s all over the
floor.  It’s looser than a breadbox. It’s taking the
jobs with it.  It’s taking the Latinos with it.  It’s
escaping out the door with a shoebox full of lost red
bullets.  It’s rising like hot air, like a child with
too many balloons.  Red and blue and young and proud
and covered with some stockbroker’s Happy Ending.

Putin signs the KYOTO PROTOCOL which will put enormous pressure
on the U.S. to do the same...Bush will refuse--although this nation
by far is the largest consumer and polluter.

This is the story you'll see covered up by the major U.S. news media.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this story doesn't make it to the
eyes
and ears of 90% of this country.

The global warming story is a major threat to the Bush administration.
Could end up being their Achilles heel. Get out the word about this
especially to those in the red states. (I realize that there are many,
many people living in the red states that don't agree with our
current president.)

What this means? The world unanimously agrees that the climate
change is bad, accelerating, and will affect the lives of earth's
inhabitants in an extremely negative way. Also, new is the idea that
once the climate change really starts it will increase in speed over
time.

Subject:      Some of my post-election thoughts.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

We needed roughly 140,000 additional votes in Ohio.  I don't
know the precise numbers as to how many person hours and=20
folks canvassing there through the preceding months 140,000
additional votes would have required, but I do know that we=20
could have "outnumbered" the religious right there with just
a bit more organizing and focus on specific political action.

We will now need to expand our base in the Northeast, the=20
North, and the West Coast, and then from there move into=20
bordering states and get our electoral vote numbers up a notch=20
or so.

We will need to steal away mindsets now controlled by=20
the Republicans, including religious right outcasts terrified
by their parents' and culture's dehumanization,
but especially those who are NOT holding to that=20
electorate for the so-called "moral values" reasons; i.e.,
bring the old-fashioned "fiscal conservatives" over to
our "church."

We must rupture and destructure "monotheism" and
move to a global pantheism (er, secular humanism)
with stealth and with the shrewdist language propaganda
we can slip through mass media censors.

We can join with the rest of our global family members=20
to censure these tiny minority world children who comprise=20
a mere 52% of our electorate and naively believe that
the rest of the planet loves their socioeconomic,=20
sociopolitical self-destructiveness.

So, HOW get some or all of these things done (within 200
years the dissolution of monotheism and "GOD" will=20
already have occurred, actually)?  I don't know, exactly,
but we ARE smarter than they are and we are=20
hurting more than they are.  They meet in churches
every week, 52 weeks of the year, and during other=20
church social and activist events.  In effect, they
"want it," their way and their morals and especially=20
their terminally ill "god concept," MORE THAN WE
DO.  Or what?

Anyhow, we're much smarter than they are and we=20
are NOT all that outnumbered by any stretch of=20
the imagination.  Again, we lost in Ohio by a mere
136,000 votes and nationwide by a mere couple of
percentage points and 3 or so million.  We have
more money than they do, more friends and support
around the world (90% to 10% !), and actually=20
easier access to networking and organizing (as our=20
greater numbers are concentrated in the cities and
we are more open to taking advantage of technologies
(internet, cell phone, etc.).

Also, we can and likely will gain the most from the
energetic youth, who number greater support for
our side than they do for the fascist side.

I, for one, needed to get my butt to Ohio
(once only) and Pennsylvania (once only)=20
more than I did.  I DID get others
to Ohio and Pennsylvania (by donating almost
1700 to various groups (ACT, Moveon, Kerry/Edwards)),
so "my time" was volunteered straight out of
my $13.00 an hour weekly paychecks.  I must say,
though, that on Election Weekend (Cleveland),
I met folks coming up from Texas, from New York City,
from California, from Seattle, many on their own
dime and, like me, using their vacation time from
their jobs. =20

Last, we 5-10 thousand poets (avant-garde,
etc.) can meet regularly for combined
political action and poetics conferences.

Let's rest for a bit, and then DO IT!

Thank you for this in general--especially your thoughts on the possibility
of the republicans fragmenting at the seam between economic and moral.
Also, thanks for your Hollywood scenario about the rewrite of Will & Grace.
I wish I had thought of that, and it definitely begins to fit the bill
of the kind of thing I was gesturing towards.

Folks,

In my post-election day blues, after busting ass to get out
the vote for Kerry in my Cleveland-area neighborhood, I came
across this poem by Whitman....

For anyone who says there is no difference between Kerry and
Bush, I say: mercury.  Halliburton.  Abu Ghraib.
Guantanamo.  Wilson's CIA wife outed.  Trumped-up threats.
1000 dead.  100,000 dead.  ad infinitum.

"When policeman break the law, there is no law." Billy Jack

Out of a great dark revolution, when survival mutated into the enemy at its
door, when evolution strayed into a dead end like a drunk staggering under the
weight of unspeakable human cruelty, we spawned this American today like a
horrible viral accident, pre-doomed to its own lack of faith and ethic, its own
undignified inhuman agenda, de-centered from its founding personalities,
bubbling up into a black life of its own, blighting, blinding, bilking, burning,
branding, burying, people, in ideas run amok, self-generating, pollinating, land
to land, man to man, world to world: the School of the Americas.

And Jesus said, the ovens have grown cold, but you no longer need me, every
word I was lives on awaiting the kingdom, the king; and the Fuhrer though spent
has arisen like the boys from Brazil, American and strong, and a kingdom
comes, the kingdom at hand, a kingdom of mutants. And in the mass torture we have
spilled the blood of contrition, slit the goat and loosed it, and no one wants
to remember: just give me grace today. Drowning boards, burnings, shackles,
hooded beatings in chairs; broom handles in anuses, glass tubes in penises,
electrodes in vaginas, mice in vaginas and anuses, gnawing at humanity, gnawing,
gnawing down the human dream. Evil is a communicable disease, its breaks down
the immune system, the human memory, with comfort. The School of the Americas,
a voice of our system, our tax dollar at work in the universe, the oozing
festering remains of fear and rebellion born of stupid greedy men, a rabid nazi
kennel of goatherd kingdom builders.

What is a rogue state? Who are the lawless? They want to make us disappear
because we want to make them appear, make them visible, floodlight hell on
earth, provide choices for ethical human beings, provide a face for evil. I will
fight no more forever except to say, bury my heart close to Jean if they let you
find my body. Evil cannot be killed. It has to find its own end, drowning in
its own vomit, torturing itself, out of reach of the dignity it has forsaken.
Let it live and it will die. Put the violated genitals on TV. Make Mickey
Mouse an instrument of torture in a series of dark cartoons. Make it popular, like
manifest destiny. I believe in evolution, and the truth is not a revolution.
It's all existence anyway isn't it?

Who says: "Vote for me for President and I will find those responsible for
this and put them on public trial as my first official act"? Nobody. Instead
it's Negroponte for ambassador. Hell, why not Pinochet, or Ollie North? I never
saw the order of the stars 'til '93, but then I lived, by dumb luck alone,
unaware of skyward things.

 "I received your letter yesterday, about the time my door knob broke. You
asked me what I was doing. Is that some kind of joke? All these people that you
mention, yes I know them they're quite lame. I had to rearrange their faces
and give them all another name. Right now I can't read too good. Don't send me
no more letters, no. Not unless you mail them from, Desolation Row." Dylan.

BELLADONNA*
(twice!)

Tuesday, November 9, 7pm
Nicole Brossard in Conversation with Mary Ann Caws
@ Poets House (72 Spring Street)
$7, Free for Members & CUNY faculty and students
(co-sponsored by Poets House, The Center for Humanities @ CUNY, and
Belladonna*)

++++

Wednesday, November 10, 7PM

A Belladonna* Reading:

Nicole Brossard & Renee Gladman
Room 9204/9205 (9th floor), The Graduate Center, CUNY, 365 5th Avenue at
34th Street. A $7-10 donation is suggested.

Nicole Brossard has published more than thirty books of poetry, essays and
novels since 1965. She co-founded and co-directed the literary magazine La
Barre du Jour, co-directed the film Some American Feminists and co-edited
the acclaimed Anthologie de la poésie des femmes au Québec, first published
in 1991 & 2003.

Mary Ann Caws, Distinguished Professor of English, French, and Comparative
Literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is the
author of many volumes on art and literature as well as editor and
co-translator of the Yale Anthology of Twentieth Century French Poetry.

Renee Gladman is the author of Juice (Kelsey St. Press 2000) and The
Activist (Krupskaya 2003). She edits Leon Works, a perfect-bound series for
experimental prose, and Leona, a pamphlet series for hybrid work. She
currently lives in Brooklyn.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,
unpredictable, dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its five
year history, Belladonna* has featured such writers as Leslie Scalapino,
Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña,
Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lynne
Tillman and Carla Harryman among many other experimental and hybrid women
writers. Beyond being a platform for women writers, the curators promote
work that is experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content. Alongside the readings, Belladonna*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event. Please contact us (Rachel Levitsky and Erica
Kaufman) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a catalog and be placed on
our list.

*deadly nightshade, a cardiac and respiratory stimulant, having purplish-red
flowers and black berries

Belladonna* readings happen monthly between September and June

Michael Moore weighs in.   Missing are the names of innocent dead Iraqis.
We may never know who they are or how many.

Unhappy Democrats Must Wait to Get Into Canada
by David Ljunggren


OTTAWA - Disgruntled Democrats seeking a safe Canadian haven after
President Bush won Tuesday's election should not pack their bags just yet.

Canadian officials made clear on Wednesday that any U.S. citizens so fed
up with Bush that they want to make a fresh start up north would have to
stand in line like any other would-be immigrants -- a wait that can take
up to a year.

"Let me tell you -- if they're hard-working honest people, there's a
process, and let them apply," Immigration Minister Judy Sgro told Reuters.

Asked whether American applicants would get special treatment, she
replied: "No, they'll join the crowd like all the other people who want to
come to Canada."

There are anywhere from 600,000 to a million Americans living in Canada,
which leans more to the left than the United States and has traditionally
favored the Democrats over the Republicans.

But statistics show a gradual decline in U.S. citizens coming to work and
live in Canada, which has an ailing health care system and relatively high
levels of personal taxation.

Government officials, real estate brokers and Democrat activists said that
while some Americans might talk about moving to Canada rather than living
with a new Bush administration, they did not expect a mass influx.

"It's one thing to say 'I'm leaving for Canada' and quite another to
actually find a job here and wonder about where you're going to live and
where the children are going to go to school," said one official.

Roger King of the Toronto-based Democrats Abroad group said he had heard
nothing about a possible exodus of party members.

"I imagine most committed Democrats will want to stay in the United States
and continue being politically active there," he said.

Americans seeking to immigrate can apply to become permanent citizens of
Canada, a process that often takes a year. Becoming a full citizen takes a
further three years.

The other main way to move north on a long-term basis is to find a job,
which in all cases requires a work permit. This takes from four to six
months to come through.

Statistics show the number of U.S. workers entering Canada dropped to
15,789 in 2002 from 21,627 in 2000. In 1981 some 10,030 Americans gained
permanent residency, compared to 5,541 in 2003.

Asked if there had been signs of increased U.S. interest, Sgro said: "Not
yet, but we'll see tomorrow."

The Canadian foreign ministry said there had been no increase in hits on
the Washington embassy's immigration Web site, while housing brokers
doubted they would see a surge in U.S. business.

"Canada's always open and welcoming to Americans who want to relocate
here, but we don't think it would be a trend or movement," said Gino
Romanese of Royal Lepage Residential Real Estate Services.

Those wishing to move to Canada could always take a risk and claim refugee
status -- the path chosen earlier this year by two U.S. deserters who
opposed the Iraq war.

"Anybody who enters Canada who claims refugee status will be provided with
a work permit...it doesn't matter what country they're from," said an
immigration ministry spokeswoman.

Refugee cases are handled by special boards, which can take months to
decide whether to admit applicants. The rulings can be appealed and
opposition politicians complain some people ordered deported have been in
Canada for 10 years or more.

I've made a few posts on my blog to connect politics, religion, and my
writing -- which are of course all connected --

but I'm also on deadline and have a book coming out (and the oppt'y to
make some changes to Da3!!!)

Alan -- how is belief an action?

I would like to point out that the number of Christian fundamentalists
in this country is tiny.  The number of regularly-churchgoing
Protestants is miniscule.  The number of observant Catholics is
decreasing.

I would like to point out that the "morality vote" figures are from the
same type of freaking exit polls which were so inaccurate.

I would like to point out that those polls show that "terrorism" and
Iraq where nearly statistically ties with this amorphous concern.  We're
talking a percentage point and a lot of political and media hype and
rhetoric here.  Defense has been "owned" by the Republicans ever since
St. Reagan's deficit spending, Star Wars, and Iran Contra.

The Catholic church comes out against almost all Catholic politicians
who are not rabidly anti-abortion.  I would like to point out that Kerry
is divorced, and so is not a communicant any longer.

Didn't Kennedy have problems?  I also think I remember a time in middle
America that John Kerry -- and most of middle America -- chose not to
remember, when KKK still burned just as many crosses on Catholics yards.
After all, "Katholics" is one of the Ks.  Hello, southern white
conservative political constituency.   When my dad and his friends ran
for political office in central Illinois *it was actually a concern that
the campaigns had to address* that the Pope would be running the sad
little town I grew up in.

The church has chosen to ally with anti-Catholics to pursue a radically
anti-birth control, anti-fertility treatment stance.  Yeah, "everyone
forgets" "pro-life" is against hormone treatments and in vitro.

The one deeply (divorced!) Catholic Mexican-American Bush voter I know
voted pro-life, not Bush, but he still doesn't realize that Mel Gibson
isn't Roman Catholic, but a member of a fringe Christian cult with a
confusing name.

Most pro-choice movements have shown that significant numbers of women
vote and give money against the stated positions of male religious
leaders of their religions.  But significant numbers of women voted for
Bush.

I might add that the fact that most of the Bush voters I know do not
regularly attend church and their beliefs in general are convenient.
Methodists who are quasi-professional country line dancers and consider
margueritas not to be an alcoholic beverage.  Those who, like Bush, paid
for abortions for knocked up girlfriends.  This is why the revival and
the rebirth is so popular -- feels good, lasts only until they strike
the tents.

Gotta go,
Catherine Daly

Or three million people turning their gaze
to Buddha.
Or three million people deciding
it doesn't matter who you love.
Or three million people 18-24
turning in their voter registration cards.

The act of writing is a political move
and politically motivated.
Solemnity's regurgitation.

Let's watch two towers fall,
and ask if the spectacle
is an illusion of solidarity.

the act of writing is a political move and politically motivated.

i'm not at all moved by the solemnity's regurgitation.

we do all we can do.

we've done all we can do.

if more than half the country has its asses pulled by the puppet,
because they can't think for themselves, perhaps it is time to
re-evaluate just what we're doing.

activism on a global scale CANNOT WORK. it's an illusion of solidarity.
what schmuck in bolivia or in italy is going to help us liberate
ourselves? it's an illusion.

perhaps we should listen to john cage (and i am paraphrasing): perhaps
it is time to leave behind the idea of activism and start acting
individually towards a collective goal i.e. a change of lifestyle is
more potent politically than an action in the streets.

think: one million people giving up, say, their car... instead of one
million people driving to nyc to protest the oily regime.

one million less cars on the road? ten million gallons less of gasoline
sales?

the right will remain strong only because folks say "no more war" or "no
more bush"

they can't remain strong if we decide to say fuck off we don't need your
product.

lifestyle changes change the world. a protest-the illusion-is a canvas
for those in power to paint their power more vivid.

consumer culture-not moral majority-is the threat.

if we want to continue aborting babies in favor of women's rights, then
prepare to eat that baby-mere recycling.

is that the kind of humor we want?

wheat grass, not hash.

Well, today one of CNN's exit pollsters reported that this wasn't the case,
that those who voted for Bush cited a variety of reasons including the economy,
the war on terror, that they perceived Bush as consistent (unlike Kerry in
their view), as well as those moral issues.  Just as many voters considered the
"war on terror" their number one concern.  I guess it depends on what time the
TV is on, who's reporting, what newspaper one reads.  Most Americans agree
with Bush's positions on most of the above.  But we already knew that.

Interesting sidebar:  it was reported that 61% of Brits consider the United
States of America a great country filled with upstanding people.  72% of the
French feel the same way.  Americans are more admired by the French than by the
Brits.  The Brits and French do agree, to the point of critical mass, that
Bush is a pain.

To this really nice thread I just want to add a couple footnotes, fwiw.

First, a recent Harper's has a piece I think by Lapham on this topic,
complementing Lakoff's theory, more anecdotal/personal/historical, but
worth looking at.

Also, I see the point about taking the other side seriously, but a
friend of mine today was literally red-in-the-face enraged and wondering
why she should take seriously a stance that, among other things,
would/will prevent her gay friends from getting married and, different
but related, preaches life while endorsing child-killing wars and
policies, et c. Someone else on the list wrote something about giving
right-leaning people a dose of righteous/compassionate anger, and I do
think there's room for that, as a certain alternative to elitist
hand-washing and finger-pointing, for example. I see the point of the
Hollywood scenarios too, all the same, and it will likely come to that,
to good effect most likely. But there are ways of taking the other side
seriously that also register direct anger at the serious hypocrisies, at
why we who disagree might think this hurts, us and them, bad -- and
doing so as an 'engaging with' rather than an elitist 'talking down,'
something I agree should be left behind.

I can't say I have any answers, myself. Will my work have an influence on
anybody? I have no idea. I've received a few letters from people who think
my earlier work has given them a fresh perspective on life. Maybe my more
recent work will influence another generation of poets and how they write.
But first of all I have to be read, and I have no scorecard on who's reading
my work. I'm just saying that in the face of political futility, I'm going
to do what I do best because I can't change the political mindset in this
country. I'm going to be a monk who writes for the next enlightened period.

Yes, poetry is marginal. It has been ever since it stopped rhyming. Does
that mean we're going to rhyme again? I doubt it. All I can do is hope that

I can influence the marginal population that reads my work. But look at the
number of marginal groups that have gained broad-based support: thirty years
ago anti-smoking was an issue championed by a very few, most of whom
appeared to be whiners and complainers. In the past 15 years it's radically
changed people's attitude toward smoking.

You're right about our grasp of poetry. I can't quote ancient work from
memory the way Allen Ginsberg could. But we live in a different time, one of
mixed media, and maybe our poetic "chops" have developed in different ways
because of our exposure to other media. An example from the jazz world: Do
you have to know every Charlie Parker solo when every alto saxophonist you
hear displays his/her roots in Parker, even the most radical innovators? We
can absorb the tradition in more than one way. At least, that's my opinion.

On a slightly separate note [to my previous post,
but also in response to this], I've been wondering
for a long time just how effective poetry can be,
at least as it's practiced today. Spicer's "nobody
listens to poetry" has never been more true, and
that's due at least as much to the failure of our
culture as it is to poetry's failure to hold the
culture's attention -- at least it seems so to me.
The background is lost, even among most poets I
know. How many of us can legitimately say that we
have a stronger grasp of poetry  -- I'm talking
large chunks of ancient and modern verse committed
so deeply to memory that it is "part of our
gesture and blood" -- than we do of popular film
and/or music. Not me. Almost everyone can quote
you song lyrics or lines from their favorite
films, but not many (outside of those in theater)
can give long sections of Shakespeare.

In a sense, the rarity of poetry has made it all
the more valuable when encountered in public
space. But is it effective? Maybe "over time"? I'm
sincerely asking this. Even Keats wondered if it
was nothing but a "jack o lantern" throwing pretty
images at the imagination. This is part of the
reason I've spent the last year learning to play
guitar. Well there is much to say about this and I
look forward to other thoughts. but back to
work...

Yes, it is a time for making poems. I'm bummed out
because of the election results, but because of
them I've committed myself to writing because over
time writing can change human sensibilities; right
now it doesn't look possible to change anything
social or political for the better in this
country. So I hope to play old Walt till Bush
returns to his ranch in Kennebunkport.

Nicole Brossard has published more than thirty books of poetry, essays and
novels since 1965. She co-founded and co-directed the literary magazine La

Mary Ann Caws, Distinguished Professor of English, French, and Comparative
Literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is the
author of many volumes on art and literature as well as editor and
co-translator of the Yale Anthology of Twentieth Century French Poetry.

Renee Gladman is the author of Juice (Kelsey St. Press 2000) and The
Activist (Krupskaya 2003). She edits Leon Works, a perfect-bound series for
experimental prose, and Leona, a pamphlet series for hybrid work. She
currently lives in Brooklyn.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,
unpredictable, dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its five
year history, Belladonna* has featured such writers as Leslie Scalapino,
Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña,
Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lynne
Tillman and Carla Harryman among many other experimental and hybrid women
writers. Beyond being a platform for women writers, the curators promote
work that is experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content. Alongside the readings, Belladonna*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event. Please contact us (Rachel Levitsky and Erica
Kaufman) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a catalog and be placed on

My friend Hassen (do you know her or her poems?  she's amazing), has the
very same ideas that you share above.  She also grew up in a rather
conservative
Christian atmosphere, although she seemed able early on to see how using
Christianinty itself could bring people around to tolerance.  Hassen has
spent
time recently on Christian chat rooms talking about the election (in fact she
posted to the PhillySound blog about this, just before she read in NY last
week).

But if you were to brainstorm some ways of going about doing this, really
setting
out to bring this form of contact of tolerant Christianity around the
fundamentalist
youth and their surroundings, what would be some key issues that you think
could be considered for discussion?  How can we make this happen?

I dont think Spicer "meant" what he said as such he was using the bitterness
to work against the other phrases in his poem- perhaps no one listens to
poetry arose frm a bitterness but in conjuntion with the sea imagery/refs,
there, it suggests that no one hears the 'sea' (sound? voice?) truly or that
Spicer feels so- of course if he was asked about he may well have said -"but
that's part of the total poem...people do listen to poetry -read poetry but
not enough people do and not enough are suffiently sensitive etc etc"  I
dont know but re the rest I dont think I know any more of films etc or songs
than I do poems some have stayed in my mind since my childhold and also I
memorised The Waste Land  when I was 20 and I have memeory of a lot of W C W
and Strevens ( I often find myself sayin, when I think or hear the word
ambiguous "Anmbiguous undulations" and so on - I remember Ron Silliman's  "
A bee the size of a cat." and Bernstein's "Toe tapping tintabultaion" and
one of them " "Ontologuical chocolate" (Silliman)  Hieinains  " A pause , a
rose etc" and some of  Susan Howe's also the Trilobite thing and parts of
Geoffery Hill eg  "God is distant, difficult." and back to the Langpos I
really "dug" Coolidge's "Polaroid" ..that is one of my favourite works and
although I cant reel of lines and lines of things I have a lot of Shakespear
in there, I have pieces of my own stuff eg "Black veins by eyelight
scrawled" is a line beginning a poem and I used "Eyelight" as the title of a
project I am doing albeit I am too busy to do much on it just now... - I
wish indeed I could have more - but playing the guitar is just another thing
to do - great, but poetry doesnt get pushed out by other media - cf Alan
Sondheim's Vispo work and the wide refs in his work; or even back to
Ashbery's and O'Hara's mix of popular culture  ..I often think of Ashbery's
"How much longer must I inhabit the divine sepulchre" (and other things from
JA - Berrigan uses that line (and others of Ashbery and other poets) to
start some of his Sonnets,,there is a lot else (one is Kendrick Smithyman of
New Zealand's "If we live, we stand in language." which ends one of his
great poems). - too much to recall accurately but the summation I think is
good and there is on question of "abandoning poetry " (a poem is never
finished just abandoned - something to that affect (Valery)) - or postponed.

Life itself is an ongoing poem.

and then everyday life has a way of being (or becoming) a big poem, and then

If anyone has tried to contact me backchannel in the last week or two, my main
email address dtv@mwt.net has proved to be as unreliable as the american
election process.  Most likely I have not received your message.  Please use my
other account which appears to be working fine:  memexikon@mwt.net

Hopefully no one has emailed me large sums of money or lifetime book publishing
contracts.

Fallujah and the Reality of War

By RAHUL MAHAJAN

The assault on Fallujah has started. It is being sold as liberation of the =
people of Fallujah; it is being sold as a necessary step to implementing "d=
emocracy" in Iraq. These are lies.

I was in Fallujah during the siege in April, and I want to paint for you a =
word picture of what such an assault means.

Fallujah is dry and hot; like Southern California, it has been made an agri=
cultural area only by virtue of extensive irrigation. It has been known for=
 years as a particularly devout city; people call it the City of a Thousand=
 Mosques. In the mid-90's, when Saddam wanted his name to be added to the c=
all to prayer, the imams of Fallujah refused.

U.S. forces bombed the power plant at the beginning of the assault; for the=
 next several weeks, Fallujah was a blacked-out town, with light provided b=
y generators only in critical places like mosques and clinics. The town was=
 placed under siege; the ban on bringing in food, medicine, and other basic=
 items was broken only when Iraqis en masse challenged the roadblocks. The =
atmosphere was one of pervasive fear, from bombing and the threat of more b=
ombing. Noncombatants and families with sick people, the elderly, and child=
ren were leaving in droves. After initial instances in which people were pr=
evented from leaving, U.S. forces began allowing everyone to leave except f=
or what they called "military age males," men usually between 15 and 60. Ke=
eping noncombatants from leaving a place under bombardment is a violation o=
f the laws of war. Of course, if you assume that every military age male is=
 an enemy, there can be no better sign that you are in the wrong country, a=
nd that, in fact, your war is on the people, not on their oppressors,, not =
a war of liberation.

The main hospital in Fallujah is across the Euphrates from the bulk of the =
town. Right at the beginning, the Americans shut down the main bridge, cutt=
ing off the hospital from the town. Doctors who wanted to treat patients ha=
d to leave the hospital, with only the equipment they could carry, and set =
up in makeshift clinics all over the city; the one I stayed at had been a n=
eighborhood clinic with one room that had four beds, and no operating theat=
er; doctors refrigerated blood in a soft-drink vending machine. Another cli=
nic, I,m told, had been an auto repair shop. This hospital closing (not the=
 only such that I documented in Iraq) also violates the Geneva Convention.

In Fallujah, you were rarely free of the sound of artillery booming in the =
background, punctuated by the smaller, higher-pitched note of the mujaheddi=
n's hand-held mortars. After even a few minutes of it, you have to stop pay=
ing attention to it and yet, of course, you never quite stop. Even today, w=
hen I hear the roar of thunder, I,m often transported instantly to April 10=
 and the dusty streets of Fallujah.

In addition to the artillery and the warplanes dropping 500, 1000, and 2000=
-pound bombs, and the murderous AC-130 Spectre gunships that can demolish a=
 whole city block in less than a minute, the Marines had snipers criss-cros=
sing the whole town. For weeks, Fallujah was a series of sometimes mutually=
 inaccessible pockets, divided by the no-man's-lands of sniper fire paths. =
Snipers fired indiscriminately, usually at whatever moved. Of 20 people I s=
aw come into the clinic I observed in a few hours, only five were "military=
-age males." I saw old women, old men, a child of 10 shot through the head;=
 terminal, the doctors told me, although in Baghdad they might have been ab=
le to save him.

One thing that snipers were very discriminating about every single ambulanc=
e I saw had bullet holes in it. Two I inspected bore clear evidence of spec=
ific, deliberate sniping. Friends of mine who went out to gather in wounded=
 people were shot at. When we first reported this fact, we came in for near=
-universal execration. Many just refused to believe it. Some asked me how I=
 knew that it wasn't the mujaheddin. Interesting question. Had, say, Browns=
ville, Texas, been encircled by the Vietnamese and bombarded (which, of cou=
rse, Mr. Bush courageously protected us from during the Vietnam war era) an=
d Brownsville ambulances been shot up, the question of whether the resident=
s were shooting at their own ambulances, I somehow guess, would not have co=
me up. Later, our reports were confirmed by the Iraqi Ministry of Health an=
d even by the U.S. military.

The best estimates are that roughly 900-1000 people were killed directly, b=
lown up, burnt, or shot. Of them, my guess, based on news reports and perso=
nal observation, is that 2/3 to were noncombatants.

But the damage goes far beyond that. You can read whenever you like about t=
he bombing of so-called Zarqawi safe houses in residential areas in Falluja=
h, but the reports don't tell you what that means. You read about precision=
 strikes, and it's true that America's GPS-guided bombs are very accurate w=
hen they,re not malfunctioning, the 80 or 85% of the time that they work, t=
heir targeting radius is 10 meters, i.e., they hit within 10 meters of the =
target. Even the smallest of them, however, the 500-pound bomb, has a blast=
 radius of 400 meters; every single bomb shakes the whole neighborhood, bre=
aking windows and smashing crockery. A town under bombardment is a town in =
constant fear.

You read the reports about X killed and Y wounded. And you should remember =
those numbers; those numbers are important. But equally important is to rem=
ember that those numbers lie in a war zone, everyone is wounded.

The first assault on Fallujah was a military failure. This time, the resist=
ance is stronger, better-armed, and better-organized; to "win," the U.S. mi=
litary will have to pull out all the stops. Even within horror and terror, =
there are degrees, and we and the people of Fallujah ain't seen nothin, yet=
. George W. Bush has just claimed a new mandate the world has been delivere=
d into his hands.

There will be international condemnation, as there was the first time; but =
our government won't listen to it; aside from the resistance, all the peopl=
e of Fallujah will be able to depend on to try to mitigate the horror will =
be us, the antiwar movement. We have a responsibility, that we didn't meet =
in April and we didn't meet in August when Najaf was similarly attacked; wi=
ll we meet it this time?

Dear Poetics Folk,

I'm writing in haste to tell you about an upcoming project. I'm guest
editing a feature
for the Web journal Big Bridge. It'll be called 'An Open Letter to
America'...the issue
will be launched near the beginning of January. Would you submit a
piece for
this feature? Let me tell you about it.

here's the link to BB if you haven't seen the site...

http://www.bigbridge.org

We plan to address issues such as globalization, nuclear proliferation,
economic
disparities, women's rights, potential legalized discrimination against
the gay and lesbian
communities, Republican plans to outlaw abortion, and other topics with
this online
broadside of poetry, essays and visual art. We are expecting the
situation in the
Middle East to become much worse, especially now since Iran threatens
to use
nuclear weapons, the situation is indeed dangerous--no dialogue exists.

The time is now. How does it feel to have a national tragedy used
against you?
The Republican party is scared. They outwardly show confidence but they
know
they need support from the entire population to push their reactionary
plan.

So far, Anne Waldman, Jerome Rothenberg, Rodrigo Toscano, Charles
Bernstein,
Charles Shaw and others are on board. I plan to contact those outside
the poetry
world to gain the largest audience possible.

I should also mention that submitted work doesn't necessarily have to
address the above topics in an overt way, although some mention of these
issues is a must. Essay, poetry, prose...I do ask only that essays are
bolstered
with source material, citations, etc. if possible. Also, you may simply
submit
a statement.

I hope you'll join us. If we put voices together real impact will
result. A steady
stream of water wears away any stone.

Please send submissions simultaneously to Michael Rothenberg at

walterblue@earthlink.net

and Larry Sawyer at

milkmag@comcast.net

Thank you.
Larry Sawyer

&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; First Question:<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You are participating in a race. You overtake the second
person.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What position are you in?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: If you answered that you are first, then you are
absolutely<BR>
&gt; wrong!<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
overtake the second person and you take his place, you<BR>
&gt; are<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; second!<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Try not to screw up in the next question.&nbsp; To answer the
second<BR>
&gt; question,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't take as much time as you took for the first
question.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Second Question: If you overtake the last person, then you
are...?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: If you answered that you are second to last, then you
are wrong<BR>
&gt; again.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST person?!<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You're not very good at this! are you?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Third Question: Very tricky math! Note: This must be done in
your<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; head<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only.&nbsp; Do NOT use paper and pencil or a calculator. Try
it.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Take 1000 and add 40 to it. Now add another 1000. Now add 30.
Add<BR>
&gt; another<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000. Now add 20. Now add
another 1000. Now add 10. What is the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Did you get 5000? The correct answer is actually 4100.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't believe it? Check with your calculator! Today is
definitely not<BR>
&gt; your<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; day. Maybe you will get the last question right?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mary's father has five daughters: 1. Nana, 2. Nene, 3. Nini,
4. Nono.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the name of the fifth daughter?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: Nunu?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; NO! Of course not. Her name is Mary. Read the question
again.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, now the bonus round . . ..<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a mute person who wants to buy a toothbrush. By
imitating the<BR>
&gt; action<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of brushing one's teeth he&nbsp; successfully expresses
himself to the<BR>
&gt; shopkeeper<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the purchase is done.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now if there is a blind man who wishes to buy a pair of
sunglasses, how<BR>
&gt; should<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he express himself?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He just has to open his mouth and ask, so simple.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>

"When policeman break the law, there is no law." Billy Jack

Out of a great dark revolution, when survival mutated into the enemy at its
door, when evolution strayed into a dead end like a drunk staggering under the
weight of unspeakable human cruelty, we spawned this American today like a
horrible viral accident, pre-doomed to its own lack of faith and ethic, its own
undignified inhuman agenda, de-centered from its founding personalities,
bubbling up into a black life of its own, blighting, blinding, bilking, burning,
branding, burying, people, in ideas run amok, self-generating, pollinating, land
to land, man to man, world to world: the School of the Americas.

And Jesus said, the ovens have grown cold, but you no longer need
me, every word I was lives on awaiting the kingdom, the king; and
the Fuhrer though spent has arisen like the boys from Brazil,
American and strong, and a kingdom comes, the kingdom at hand, a
kingdom of mutants. And in the mass torture we have spilled the
blood of contrition, slit the goat and loosed it, and no one wants
to remember: just give me grace today. Drowning boards, burnings,
shackles, hooded beatings in chairs; broom handles in anuses, glass tubes in
penises, electrodes in vaginas, mice in vaginas and anuses, gnawing at
humanity, gnawing, gnawing down the human dream. Evil is a communicable disease, its
breaks down the immune system, the human memory, with comfort. The School of
the Americas, a voice of our system, our tax dollar at work in the universe,
the oozing festering remains of fear and rebellion born of stupid greedy men, a
rabid nazi kennel of goatherd kingdom builders.

What is a rogue state? Who are the lawless? They want to make us
disappear because we want to make them appear, make them visible,
floodlight hell on earth, provide choices for ethical human beings, provide a
face for evil. I will fight no more forever except to say, bury my heart
close to Jean if they let you find my body. Evil cannot be killed. It has to find
its own end, drowning in its own vomit, torturing itself, out of reach of the
dignity it has forsaken. Let it live and it will die. Put the violated
genitals on TV. Make Mickey Mouse an instrument of torture in a series of dark
cartoons. Make it popular, like manifest destiny. I believe in evolution, and the
truth is not a revolution. It's all existence anyway isn't it?

Who says: "Vote for me for President and I will find those
responsible for this and put them on public trial as my first
official act" Nobody. Instead it's Negroponte for ambassador. Hell, why not
Pinochet, or Ollie North? I never saw the order of the stars 'til '93, but then
I lived, by dumb luck alone, unaware of skyward things.

"I received your letter yesterday, about the time my door knob
broke. You asked me what I was doing. Is that some kind of joke? All these
people that you mention, yes I know them they're quite lame. I had to rearrange
their faces and give them all another name. Right now I can't read too good.
Don't send me no more letters, no. Not unless you mail them from, Desolation
Row." Dylan.

1,123
is today's total of American dead in Iraq.

Without cable TV, it can be difficult getting the news,
but this morning I tuned into one of those network
morning shows and California Democrat Rep. Nancy Pelosi
and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell were on a split screen
being interviewed by some knucklehead named Matt.

Pelosi was talking about Bush's scary spending and the
fear for Social Security, tax cuts for the rich, etc., and this
Matt guy would interrupt her with, "NOW look, this is not
sounding like you're interested in unity here!  This country
needs unity!"  (she's still talking while he's saying all this
by the way) and then Matt hands it over to McConnell,
completely cutting Pelosi off.  And of course McConnell
counters each of her points with the usual denial we've been
hearing all along.  The president cares, the president cares.

Pelosi gets to talk again, this time trying to talk about the
importance of dialog, the need for open debate, and she
gets sideswiped again by Matt, who once again turns the
topics over to McConnell, who NEVER gets interrupted.

It again happen a third time, this dismissive interruption.

Unity?  I really don't give a damn if Kerry thinks we should
all unite for the sake of the country.  I voted for him, but
it was difficult, especially considering how he's always cared
a bit too damn much about unity in these dark times, voting
for The Patriot Act over pressures for unity, etc.

The only unity I'm interested in is unity AGAINST Bush!

Is this the same sort of thing the large number of Germans
who DIDN'T vote for Hitler were up against?  Unity?  It's good
for Germany if we could just put aside our differences and unite.
We need unity.  Let's come together for the Fatherland.

History tends to forget that Hitler did not win by a landslide.
Will history be more generous with us?  NOT if we buy into
this unity crap!

There's simply no room for unity now.  This is NOT a sour grapes,
sore loser approach, it's more about choosing right over wrong,
regardless of the majority vote.  The majority made the wrong
decision, no to unity, no way.

(cut to commercial)::::
I can't believe how grotesque a lie this new (new for me at least)
commercial for the Army is.  I'm NOT making this up, soldiers
are actually shown playing golf and football.  Everyone and everything
is clean, smiling, and there's sunshine, but not desert sunshine.
In fact, the landscape is hills, very green hills, like it's an advertisement
for spring water.  An army of one?  Unity again?

Where are the 1,123 ghosts standing on the unity issue these days?

I may be wrong, but I don't think this is accurate.  The American population,
if anything, has moved to the left.  Most southerners no longer believe that
slavery is a viable economic tool, and a fairly large percentage of college
educated Midwesterners are ready to accept gay "civil unions" with all the legal
rights accorded to marriage -- as just two examples.

Unfortunately, this still leaves them far to the right of what we coasters
would consider the center.  The majority of Americans have always been
conservative, very conservative.  When I was in Ohio for the Avant-garde symposium, I
conversed with many blue color men and women in the local bars.  Most of them
spoke of NYC, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco as if they were foreign
countries, not because of any great cultural divide (though that certainly applies),
but simply because they had never been to a "big city" other than Cleveland
or Cincinnati.  The Midwest is landlocked, for the most part.  It doesn't feel
the influence of Europe, or Asia, or South America, or much of anything beyond
itself, with the exception of Canada depending on which part of the Midwest
we are talking about.

I recall a piece on one of the 24 hour cable news stations which focused on a
small town in South Dakota.  The people there were upset because they were
not getting enough money from Homeland Security to protect themselves against
terrorists.  Imagine that.  Their fear was genuine, however ridiculous it may
seem to those of us from anywhere who have more education and/or who live near
the coasts.  That a terrorist would gain nothing from an attack on a small town
in South Dakota did not seem to register with any of those interviewed.  For
many rural Midwesterners, it's a small world indeed.

Clearly information (news, education, etc.) is filtered differently in such
places, via the culture and geographical limitations.  Religion -- usually the
harsher, "landlocked" versions -- means a lot, and that is fairly typical of
rural populations.  (And, of course, religion anywhere always insures some
degree of resistance to understanding.)  There seems to be, in general, a palpable
sense of isolation in most mid-country Americans.  The people feel it one way
or another.  Many celebrate it.  It's not surprising that they, and perhaps
we also, retreat from what is not well delineated, well understood-- i.e., the
"other."

I doubt the Democratic Party can retool such that it becomes, once again, a
50 state contender, not without shedding those on the left who currently
support it.  When the Democratic Party ruled the South, it was the party of George
Wallace, Lester Maddox, etc.  Democrats are not likely to embrace the current
bigotries.  I could be wrong, of course -- lots of money and power at stake.  I
don't expect most Americans to move much further to the left, at least not in
the foreseeable future.  After all, at one time the news was controlled by
three "liberal" networks.  They had an impact, even on conservative America,
being the only games in town.  24 hour news cable channels have "righted" that
situation.

Nader may be the only candidate who isn't owned by corporate America.  All
that means is that he will never get the financial support necessary to mount a
serious campaign.

I'm not at all surprised that Bush won.  I expected it.  I held my nose and
voted for Kerry, as did most New Yorkers.  If there had been a viable socialist
candidate, I would have voted for him/her.

I did my graduate work at Tulane University, and taught for nine years at
that institution, and another four years at LSU Baton Rouge before settling down
at SUNY, so I know a little bit about the South.  The owner of the gas station
in my Baton Rouge neighborhood was named Crowe Peele.  Very sociable guy.
Nearly every time I stopped in for gas I could hear him ranting about the Blacks
and Jews.  Strangely, when he told me that his mechanic, Joe, who was black,
had died, he teared up.  Seems the two men had been partners for decades.
Crowe clearly felt the loss of a friend.  Yet he could not (or would not?)
connect the dots.

I returned to NYC, home sweet home, in 1990.  For me, the only bright spot in
this election debacle is that I can live in NYC.  The city remains a hybrid
thing, a cool concoction of American (North and South), European, Asian and
African influences.  The poetry scene is very much alive and well.  I think I
understand, to some degree, that sense of isolation so many southerners and
middle Americans feel.  As a New Yorker, I feel it too.  And yeah, I celebrate it.

Best, Bill

I don't know why it didn't pass, except that we do have a law and many
people weren't ready to expand it. I think people feel insecure right now,
and they should be. Meanwhile, Oregon went to Kerry by a wide margin.
Oregonians voted to protect our forests from greedy logging. Portland
elected a liberal mayor and the first openly-gay member of the City Council.
And Portlanders turned down a try by the right-wing to rescind a three-year
tax we placed on ourselves in order to keep our schools open for the whole
school year, and for other social uses. We're dismayed at the country, but
proud of ourselves.

This is the first honest reaction to the election. No excuses, no what one=20

Poetic Listers:

It has always been interesting for me to see the reactions of Secular people
to the power of Religion. As a person who is a progressive and a religious
person I think I have a unique perspective. The reality is that very few
parts of the globe live in a post-religious mindset- Western Europe, Canada,
Japan, the Blue parts of the USA are certainly there but the reality in
Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East is that religion is a
powerful force that is alive for many people.

There has been a global debate between secular and religious views since at
least Descarte but in much of the developing world religion has efficacy
because it serves a powerful need to belong and to be taken care of to have
a nurturing environment.  There is little difference between what motivates
Evangelical Christians in the South USA, Members of Christian Catholic Base
Communities in Latin America, Islamic Fundamentalists, Hindu Fundamentalists
and alike they all crave order and community. These communities help people
to negotiate often harsh lives and these people are not stupid they are in
fact doing what they have to to survive in a harsh world. The secular Left
in the USA and in other places has not provided another
means to doing this they have done so in Europe but that is a special case.

The problem for the Left in the USA is that they have forgotten that the US
is, outside of major population centers, more like the Developing World than
Europe.  Religion remains a powerful force and the people who live in that
world will never vote for a man like John Kerry who is alien to them.  I
wrote in my blog about this the fact is that Europe was able to secularize
because the government takes care of economic and personal security, in the
USA we live in a Social Darwinist experiment with no security and religion
serves as a security for many people.

Until the Left in the USA can convince working class people that they can
change this dynamic and provide real security for people it will continue to
lose ground. The Left in America should learn from the Right, create a
counter establishment, create a philosophy of their movement and fight to
win that argument. People are not going to vote for a me too party or
movement.

I'm in the midst of the long drive from California to NY, with only
sporadic computer access. An interesting time to travel, and it's brought
from latent to full consciousness a suspicion of mine that may have some
bearing on the awful question of why so many are so susceptible to cheap
sloganeering that they consistently vote against their own interests.

I've been in Texas for three days, eavsedropping on conversations and
engaging in a few. All very friendly. It's striking that I haven't heard a
word about the election or for that matter any political issues. I'm
reminded of the traditional American etiquette that forbids discussion of
religion, politics or money. My experience in San Diego, where most of the
anglo population is from small cities in the midwest, is that that rule is
still in place.

But democracy requires constant dialogue. Many of the voters in this past
election forget the dialogue part, and most forget the constant part. For a
democracy to work, and this was clearly the intent of our founding fathers,
elitist as they tended to be, politics has to be a full-time concern of the
electorate. Most of the electorate seeems to consider the burden too
onerous. But it's the price of self-rule. One can pay attention to baseball
only during the series or to god only at easter and christmas and get up to
speed pretty fast. If one pays attention to politics only for a couple of
months every four years one is likely to be a dupe.

I have no idea what to do about this.

Mark

Dear mIEKAL,

I emailed you the number of an account in your name in which I deposited
a large sum of money earlier in the week.  I had been depressed due to a
series of electoral issues and thought to return to Ireland liquidating
my significant assets here (mainly paper).  I thought of you as someone
who represented what is best in American independence, initiative,
self-sufficiency, community, creativity, responsibility, and
entrepreneurship.  However, when I did not receive a reply I changed my
mind.  Sorry!

If anyone has tried to contact me backchannel in the last week or two,
my main
email address dtv@mwt.net has proved to be as unreliable as the american
election process.  Most likely I have not received your message.  Please
use my
other account which appears to be working fine:  memexikon@mwt.net

Hopefully no one has emailed me large sums of money or lifetime book
publishing
contracts.

On this side of the Atlantic people are really wondering how someone like Bush
can get elected. & yet no one I've talked to seems surprised or overly
concerned, the American way being so predictable at this point.  My son Zon,
who is travelling with us, age 16, took the defeat of Kerry pretty hard,
feeling very strongly that it's his generation that is gonna have to slog thru
outcome of the next four years of stupidity.  He feels like there must be
something young people can do other than move to another country, but
regretably I'm not a very good role model for demonstrating faith in American
electorial politics.  Sometimes humor is the only remedy at hand & Zon has
snapped photos of the following 2 street graffiti for your viewing pleasure:

Vlad Tepes (The Impaler) for President. (Shot in Cluj-Napoca}
http://flickr.com/photos/miekal/1302035/

Fuck the USA
http://flickr.com/photos/miekal/1297654/

I've been trying to follow some of the discussion on various lists regarding
post-election trauma & recovery, especially since you all convinced me to vote
for Kerry the talking head, the first time since 76 that I've voted.  Here in
Romania I'm somewhat amused that just now their presidental campaign is
starting & I'm having to endure two presidental elections in the same month.
One of the candidates is Vadim Tudor who is a crazy poet & arch-nationalist.
Yesterday on the radio he made a speech about how all of his opponents are
little green men who arrived in this land with UFOs & they don't have any
connection with the Romanian land.

& all this time I thought I was the one who was an alien.

Does anybody know where I could find a map or stats that would explain
state by state or, preferably, county by county, where the 40% of adults who
didn't vote might live. I don't know if it will prove anything, but I think
it would be important to find....

Vlad the Impaler for President! At least he'd be a better bloodsucker than
the one who currently sits in the President's chair. Trouble is, he wasn't
born in the U.S. We'll have to pass the Arnold Amendment to bring in Vlad.
I'm betting on Tepes to clean house in a big way. He'll help the logging
industry, as well.

Dear Ray -- I pretty much agree with you on the whole, and am afraid I
posted yr comments on my blog -- although I can take it off if you want
--

but then why are people gutting social security?  why are they voting
against health care reform?  why do they vote against "big government"
-- especially for a man who has created a new gov't agency, etc.?  my
parents were confused about two Florida ballot measures, which were 1)
ability to access malpractice suit information for doctors who have lost
three or more suits (I think this passed but don't know for sure), 2)
ability to revoke licenses of doctors who have lost three or more
malpractice suits (this was soundly defeated).  They were pointing out
that 30% of the people who voted to find out whether or not a doctor was
bad voted for keeping that bad doctor in practice.

Seems silly, but here in Los Angeles, we have Drew, which is in South
Central.  A lot of my former students were advised by the college
advisors to major in Bio and get med tech training at Drew.  While Drew
is the only major medical center for miles around -- in all of Watts and
South Central -- (USC's is nowhere near USC, it is on the East Side) --
it is just terrible. All kinds of scandals, terribly bad care. So people
are in the rocky position of fighting to keep Drew open even though the
licenses were revoked or something.

Mark, I posted some of yours too -- is this a "the personal is
political" problem really?  I think I remember commenting in a draft of
a review that a while back, mainstream poetry anthologists were decrying
the lack of political poetry -- anyway, I was pointing out that there
was an abundance of political poetry, but it was generally political in
an organic way, a personal way if you will, not in a "this is a poem
about the flag" way.  The way in which the personal political is nuanced
in a way that sloganeering and agitprop can't be?  The way in which
public discourse has become privatized and so simplified?

My mother has been concerned for years! about the black box voting
machines -- was it Patrick Herron who posted about them?  I am curious
-- I voted on them, smart cards were used -- what is the problem
exactly?  I mean, so there's no paper, but certainly there is an
electronic audit trail, and a way to compare the votes recorded directly
from screen onto disk into tables versus those reported via the
communications pipeline? I mean, there _IS_ a back up from each stage of
the process and an audit trail, right?  Isn't the point that there's no
paper?  What's up with these lost electronic votes & misreporting in
Ohio?  At first, I thought this reporting was just internet hoaxing off
all of the joke animated touch screen voting things (I got about five of
them right around the time of the election -- they are the sorts of
things that become false "inet 'news'" very quickly).  But what up with
the exit polls and the voting machines?

All best,
Catherine Daly

Yes, being one who lives in Portland I want to add that we also re-elected
the city council member who took the initiative to give out hundereds of
marraige licenses to same sex couples this last spring, as well as
re-electing some of those "activist judges" Bush is so fond of. As far as
the medical marijuana measure is concerned, the measure itself was quite
convoluted and, if it would have passed, would have added many more
bureaucratic layers to the whole process of obtaining eligibility for the
med, and, once eligible, obtaining the med itself. Right now the process is,
comparatively, much simpler. Which is why I think it did not pass.

So Portland has a progressive majority. And a big book store. And the city
is affordable. Now we just more (good) poets to move here....

Catherine,

It's understandable that your parents were confused. All of the amendments
In Florida were poorly written. I abstained on at least half of them just
because I couldn't understand what they were trying to tell me.

I don't know if the computers have adequate backup systems. When Jimmy
Carter came down here, he expressed dissatisfaction with the machines and
said something to the effect that he didn't think Florida could ensure an
honest election.

In my precinct, two women voted for Kerry, only to find their computer had
somehow changed to Bush. They got their votes corrected. Once again, my
wisecrack on the machines: I figure they were reprogrammed/hacked so that
every third Kerry vote went to Bush.

Jeb and his brother are an example of Family Values at work, so now you know

Dear Ray -- I pretty much agree with you on the whole, and am afraid I
posted yr comments on my blog -- although I can take it off if you want
--

but then why are people gutting social security?  why are they voting
against health care reform?  why do they vote against "big government"
-- especially for a man who has created a new gov't agency, etc.?  my
parents were confused about two Florida ballot measures, which were 1)
ability to access malpractice suit information for doctors who have lost
three or more suits (I think this passed but don't know for sure), 2)
ability to revoke licenses of doctors who have lost three or more
malpractice suits (this was soundly defeated).  They were pointing out
that 30% of the people who voted to find out whether or not a doctor was
bad voted for keeping that bad doctor in practice.

Seems silly, but here in Los Angeles, we have Drew, which is in South
Central.  A lot of my former students were advised by the college
advisors to major in Bio and get med tech training at Drew.  While Drew
is the only major medical center for miles around -- in all of Watts and
South Central -- (USC's is nowhere near USC, it is on the East Side) --
it is just terrible. All kinds of scandals, terribly bad care. So people
are in the rocky position of fighting to keep Drew open even though the
licenses were revoked or something.

Mark, I posted some of yours too -- is this a "the personal is
political" problem really?  I think I remember commenting in a draft of
a review that a while back, mainstream poetry anthologists were decrying
the lack of political poetry -- anyway, I was pointing out that there
was an abundance of political poetry, but it was generally political in
an organic way, a personal way if you will, not in a "this is a poem
about the flag" way.  The way in which the personal political is nuanced
in a way that sloganeering and agitprop can't be?  The way in which
public discourse has become privatized and so simplified?

My mother has been concerned for years! about the black box voting
machines -- was it Patrick Herron who posted about them?  I am curious
-- I voted on them, smart cards were used -- what is the problem
exactly?  I mean, so there's no paper, but certainly there is an
electronic audit trail, and a way to compare the votes recorded directly
from screen onto disk into tables versus those reported via the
communications pipeline? I mean, there _IS_ a back up from each stage of
the process and an audit trail, right?  Isn't the point that there's no
paper?  What's up with these lost electronic votes & misreporting in
Ohio?  At first, I thought this reporting was just internet hoaxing off
all of the joke animated touch screen voting things (I got about five of
them right around the time of the election -- they are the sorts of
things that become false "inet 'news'" very quickly).  But what up with
the exit polls and the voting machines?

All best,
Catherine Daly

You are correct I think, Christophe, that *mandating* action (seizing
power and making people better by forcible means, ie. activism) is a
seduction -- and is only sufficient as long as it is unattained.

Think about that.

Accomplishment (ie. freedom) can only be realized by NOT seizing power,
by NOT retaining it -- only by actual *submission* (which means a
preference to suffering rather than a preference to using force). One,
simply, submits to being free. This is true because 'ruling' (ie.
prescribed direction; activism) means using force, and using force means
doing to others what we would NOT like done to ourselves -- that is,
doing wrong (removing freedom).


http://dictionary.reference.com/search?&q=activism

..|  perhaps it is time to leave behind the idea of activism
..|  and start acting individually towards a collective goal
..|  i.e. a change of lifestyle
 [..]
..|  think: one million people giving up, say, their car...
..|  instead of one million people driving to nyc to protest
..|  ... one million less cars on the road? [etc.]


This is very good thinking. Leaving behind the love of power (ie.
gratification of our own lusts; activism) in favor of the *personal*
(that which does NOT affect another, which is *restricted* to the
individual and has *no connection with the rest* ~ 4'33") -- this
unseen, intangible, and underlying force -- is, I think, a more capable
path because it does not do unto others what you would not like done to
yourself (ie. removing freedom; prescribed direction; etc.). Indeed, the
chief property of freedom is a potential to openness:


                Grow your dreadlocks
                Don't be afraid of the wolf pack


The even more wondrous thing which you may have overlooked (maybe not)
is that this personal method does not require *everybody* to reach
achievement: most people lead lives of muted desperation! Indeed, just
like water filling a vessel floating on water -- at first the water only
runs in slowly on one side, but, as the vessel grows heavier it almost
*instantaneously* fills with water (the age of Aquarius is upon us!).
Which is to say maybe only very few or less of the world's population is
all that is needed to move everyone along to a pouring out of real
freedom:


                I tell you, one man walking
                Is a billion men sparking



        -- Derek

With 40 million actual votes unverifiable due to electronic voting with
no paper trail, the 2004 presidential election is quite possibly a load
of bullshit.  Yes, 40 million of the total votes were from e-vote
machines.

You can see the spread of electronic voting here:
http://snipurl.com/aejb.  And in my backyard of North Carolina:
http://snipurl.com/aejd.

Sounds like a predictable response from me, I know.  Slate has already
dismissed arguments like mine as "conspiracy-minded."  You know me, I'm
so predictable.  We *reasonable* people all know there's no such thing
as a conspiracy.  Right?  But bear with me.  And ask yourself, am I
really being irrational?  I fully realize I sound loony by merely
suggesting any wrongdoing.  But is my skepticism truly groundless? =20

The results in Florida weren't close as we all know.  That gap (52% to
47% in favor of Bush) we are told is supposed to suggest there was not a
sufficient amount of wrongdoing there to swing the election.  I cannot
help but wonder, however, about the validity of those results when 50%
of votes passed through e-vote machines in that state.  50% of the
Florida vote is completely unverifiable and run completely by Republican
partisan interests who benefit from trade law protections.  50% of the
votes might as well be imaginary votes.  Ohio had unverifiable e-voting
in a sufficient number of precincts representing a sufficient number of
votes to change the outcome.   OK I'm speculating it seems, but do I
have any evidence to even make such a suggestion?

The first piece of evidence is prior probability.  We know that there
have been massive problems with the machines.  We have a paper trail of
documented problems.  Those problems have been demonstrated over and
over and over again, but the courts won't have any of it.  The prior
probability shows a fix is likely. =20

For example, we saw massive problems and wrongdoings by the Bushies in
Florida in 2000, and that wrongdoing ultimately decided the election.

Another example--the Republican candidate for Georgia's governorship won
the 2002 election when polls indicated that his Democratic opponent was
likely to beat him by a margin of 9 to 11 points.  In the same year, a
Republican candidate for Senator defeated his Democratic opponent, even
though the Dem was expected to win by a 2 to 5 point margin.  The
combination of these two results are, statistically speaking,
astronomically unlikely.  In 2002, Georgia became the first state in the
U.S. to use computerized touch-screen voting machines in all of its
election districts.  Georgia's votes were not counted by state election
officials but were instead counted by employees of the corporation that
manufactured and programmed the computerized voting machines. Those
machines produced no paper voting records or any other means to verify
the vote.  What happened in Georgia was not unique to the 2002
elections. Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, and New Hampshire also
experienced unusual last-minute swings in some of their election
districts, but only in the ones that used electronic voting machines.
Interestingly, those sudden and unexpected swings only occurred in hotly
contested districts, and in each case, the underdog who won was a
Republican.

Sequoia Voting Systems software was discovered by hackers and found to
be full of vulnerabilities.  Those of you who are savvy enough can have
a look at the code here:
http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~tarantul/WinEDS200.zip

The second piece of evidence is the combination of bias & motive.  CEOs,
founders and owners of Diebold and ES&S are either big shot Republican
fundraisers (Diebold) or Republican Senators who have already won
suspect elections from their very own machines (Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Nebraska). In August, 2003, Diebold CEO Walden O'Dell wrote a letter
to Ohio Republicans in which he said he was "committed to helping Ohio
to deliver its electoral votes to the president next year." He wrote
this letter at the very time Diebold was bidding for a contract to sell
its voting machines to the state of Ohio.  What=92s more, even after
O'Dell's letter was exposed to the public, Ohio's Secretary of State,
Ken Blackwell--who happens to be a Republican & who also attempted to
deny delivery of provisional ballots across Ohio--had the audacity to
put Diebold on Ohio's list of preferred voting machine vendors.
Diebold's machines were used in Ohio's presidential election Tuesday.
Chuck Hagel, the head of ES&S, sold his company's voting machines to the
state of Nebraska. Shortly after that he became Nebraska's first
Republican Senator in 24 years. Eighty percent of Hagel's votes were
counted by ES&S employees in complete corporate secrecy.   ES&S machines
were used for Dade, Martin, Lake, Sumter, Pasco, Collier, Nassau,
Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee, and Broward counties (Sequoia machines were
used in Indian River, Pinellas, Hillsborough, in Palm Beach County).

Here's a bit of a run-down on Diebold, Sequoia, and ES&S:

The Diebold Board of Directors
W.R. Timken, Jr., Timken Company,  Ohio layoffs, 2004 Bush Ranger, Bush
appointee to the Securities Investor Protection Corp.
Walden O'Dell, Bush Pioneer in 2000 and 2004 who promised to deliver the
election in 2003
Henry Wallace, Ford Motor Company--Ford is a heavy contributor to Bush
campaign; bush Interior Secretary Gale Norton fmr Ford board member)
John Lauer, Oglebay Norton--mining company; need I say more? Oh, right,
Laurer also was responsible for an Enron-like scam that sunk the company
and looted the investments of its shareholders; see
http://www.clevescene.com/issues/2004-09-22/news/feature.html
Phillip Lassiter,  Ambac--he recently appointed to Ambac board a Laura
Unger, formerly appointed by Bush to serve as Acting Chairman of the SEC
Richard Crandall, Aspen Partners--one of the managers of the hedge fund
is a William Ware Bush, relation to the president unknown
Louis Bockius, Bocko Corp.--Ohio layoff lover
Christopher Connor,  Sherwin-Williams--a company that has regularly
fought environmental regulations against the use of lead

Sequoia Voting Systems
subsidiary of De La Rue, acquired 2002; De La Rue won the contract to
print Iraq's new Saddam Hussein-free banknotes. It's estimated this
print job brought in about $20 million for Sequoia's parent company.

On ES&S, I borrow from  "Diebold, Electronic Voting and the Vast
Right-Wing Conspiracy," an article by Bob Fitrakis of Columbus Ohio's
The Free Press:
"In the early 1980s, brothers Bob and Todd Urosevich founded ES&S=92s
originator, Data Mark. The brothers Urosevich obtained financing from
the far-Right Ahmanson family in 1984, which purchased a 68% ownership
stake, according to the Omaha World Herald. After brothers William and
Robert Ahmanson infused Data Mark with new capital, the name was changed
to American Information Systems (AIS). California newspapers have long
documented the Ahmanson family=92s ties to right-wing evangelical
Christian and Republican circles.

"According to Group Watch, in the 1980s Howard F. Ahmanson, Jr. was a
member of the highly secretive far-Right Council for National Policy, an
organization that included Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, Major
General John K. Singlaub and other Iran-Contra scandal notables, as well
as former Klan members like Richard Shoff. Ahmanson, heir to a savings
and loan fortune, is little reported on in the mainstream U.S. press.
But, English papers like The Independent are a bit more forthcoming on
Ahmanson=92s politics.

"Ahmanson is also a chief contributor to the Chalcedon Institute that
supports the Christian reconstruction movement. The movement=92s
philosophy advocates, among other things, "mandating the death penalty
for homosexuals and drunkards."

"The Ahmanson family sold their shares in American Information Systems
to the McCarthy Group and the World Herald Company, Inc. Republican
Senator Chuck Hagel disclosed in public documents that he was the
Chairman of American Information Systems and claimed between a $1 to 5
million investment in the McCarthy Group. In 1997, American Information
Systems purchased Business Records Corp. (BRC), formerly Texas-based
election company Cronus Industries, to become ES&S. One of the BRC
owners was Carolyn Hunt of the right-wing Hunt oil family, which
supplied much of the original money for the Council on National Policy.

"In 1996, Hagel became the first elected Republican Nebraska senator in
24 years when he did surprisingly well in an election where the votes
were verified by the company he served as chairman and maintained a
financial investment. In both the 1996 and 2002 elections, Hagel=92s =
ES&S
counted an estimated 80% of his winning votes. Due to the contracting
out of services, confidentiality agreements between the State of
Nebraska and the company kept this matter out of the public eye. =
Hagel=92s
first election victory was described as a "stunning upset" by one
Nebraska newspaper.

"Hagel=92s official biography states, "Prior to his election to the U.S.
Senate, Hagel worked in the private sector as the President of McCarthy
and Company, an investment banking firm based in Omaha, Nebraska and
served as Chairman of the Board of American Information Systems." During
the first Bush presidency, Hagel served as Deputy Director and Chief
Operating Officer of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations
(G-7 Summit).

"Bob Urosevich was the Programmer and CEO at AIS, before being replaced
by Hagel. Bob now heads Diebold Election Systems and his brother Todd is
a top executive at ES&S. Bob created Diebold=92s original electronic
voting machine software. Thus, the brothers Urosevich, originally funded
by the far Right, figure in the counting of approximately 80% of
electronic voting in the United States.

"Like Ohio, the State of Maryland was disturbed by the potential for
massive electronic voter fraud. The voters of that state were reassured
when the state hired SAIC to monitor Diebold=92s system. SAIC=92s former =
CEO
is Admiral Bill Owens. Owens served as a military aide to both Vice
President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, who
now works with George H.W. Bush at the controversial Carlyle Group.
Robert Gates, former CIA Director and close friend of the Bush family,
also served on the SAIC Board."
(http://snipurl.com/aequ)


The third piece of evidence: the exit poll results in Florida.  The
biggest problem is precision--something that cannot be verified.  We can
only look to exit polls to see if the election outcome was at least
remotely reasonable.  In Ohio the exit polls were not inconsistent with
the final tally.  However in Florida the outcome was HIGHLY unlikely
given their exit polls (+/- 4 SEM, which means the actual vote given the
exit polls had a likelihood of 0.0000634%, which is pretty damn close to
zero; for statisticians, it IS zero) .  (See
http://synapse.princeton.edu/~sam/poll-discrepancy-z-scores.jpg for an
illustration of the statistic in comparison to other states; if you're
wondering about Missouri, read the following analysis from the Missouri
Bar: http://www.mobar.org/journal/2001/novdec/jarrett.htm)  We cannot
audit the Florida votes themselves, but another exit poll could be
conducted.

Without a paper trail, a recount cannot be conducted.  If official
Florida results showed a close race, a recount would have been a legal
nightmare that would have eclipsed what happened in 2000.    The margin
in Florida was too great for a recount.  Was this a matter of
convenience? =20

*The bigger the lie, the more people believe.*

The fourth piece of evidence: the demographics of increased voter
turnout.  Typically in a presidential election, lefty voters show a
greater increase in turnout than Republican voters.  It's as if, in this
election, the majority of anti-Bush newly-turned-out voters across the
nation voted for Bush.  Hmm.  This is a piece of evidence, admittedly,
that has yet to materialize.  The massive increase in voter
registrations since 2000 were primarily Democrat, but Rove & Co. built
an impressive 72-hour get-out-the-Bush-vote grassroots campaign,
designed to contact all unlikely Republican voters three times in 72
hours, one interpersonal.  In the coming says we should be able to get
the statistics, however, and know whether there is something here in the
increased turnout. =20

Finally, there is no evidence to the contrary, that electronic voting
was not biased.  There is no way that contrary evidence can be
demonstrated.  In fact, it's illegal to demonstrate such validity.

40 million electronic votes.  Poof.  Just like that.  Out comes a
president.

Let's face it.  Many of us suspect the Republicans have formed a
kleptocracy.  We see again and again that they lie and deceive 24-7 in
order to steal more.  We can see they are looting the wealthiest nation
in history if we only look.  Ask yourself: given the slightest of
evidence, do you put an election heist past them?  When Bush says things
like, =93I feel like God wants me to run for President. I can=92t =
explain
it, but I sense my country is going to need me. Something is going to
happen . . . I know it won=92t be easy on me or my family, but God wants
me to do it.=94  This election was in the bag for Kerry with a major
*under*estimation of turnout.  And when we see pictures and eyewitness
accounts like this one in Ohio (http://tinyurl.com/3t3cr) you just have
to wonder....

Coups typically use the power of the existing government for its own
takeover. As renowned economist, historian, and leading military
strategy consultant Edward Luttwak remarks in his book _Coup d'=E9tat: A
practical handbook_, a book translated into 14 languages: "A coup
consists of the infiltration of a small but critical segment of the
state apparatus, which is then used to displace the government from its
control of the remainder." Use of military or other organized force is
not the defining feature of a coup d'=E9tat. Any seizure of the state
apparatus by extra-legal tactics may be considered a coup, according to
Luttwak.

Ultimately few in the government are fighting for your right to vote.
Edwards reportedly encouraged Kerry to continue to count in Ohio, but
Kerry opted for "unity."  We can be sure Bush will not go centrist on
us.  Meanwhile, the media proliferate their claims that e-voting was a
success--because, they say, no widespread problems were reported.
Without a trail, what's there to report?

We on the left, we were gutless Tuesday night when things looked bad.
Many of us stopped watching and gave up hope well before Ohio was
settled.  We threw up our hands, citing that America is on the whole
homophobic, misogynist, stupid.  Many of us are now wringing our hands,
citing secession or leaving the country altogether.  A lot of Americans
may be stupid, homophobic, and misogynist, to be sure, but the election
in no way proves that is the case with the majority. =20

40 million votes. =20

Vaporware.=20

Alas, there is absolutely nothing we can do to change this election.
Nothing.  We can't go back and count those votes--they are not there to
be counted.  Gone.  Our legislature has failed to protect us, because we
have failed to insist on it.

So we can't do much now.  It's too late.  But what can we do about the
next election?  Based on this election, we can anticipate that the fight
to force states to make sure a paper trail is created from electronic
voting machines will fade.  But that fight must continue.

I will fully admit the entirety of my argument could be wrong.  Unlike
electronic votes my argument is verifiable.  Don't some of these
questions and issues make you wonder, not just a little bit?  We don't
have the 40 million votes needed to ultimately substantiate or reject my
argument.  That *should* make you very nervous, very concerned.  If
you're a freedom-loving American.

Be rest assured, no one can be sure that Bush has the mandate of the
masses.  The sound of confidence in such a claim is nothing but noise.
Fear not.

So don=92t give up on America.  Protect your right to vote.  Bush might =
be
marching freedom out the door, but you can stop him.  You can fight for
election paper trails, and fight for validation of electronic voting
regardless of the margin of outcome between candidates.  You can start
by fighting for H.R.2239 and S.1980, stalled bills which would amend the
Help America Vote Act of 2002 by requiring a voter-verified permanent
record or hardcopy of all electronic votes.  You can also educate
yourself about the problems of electronic voting and educate others.
You can support a movement to impeach Bush for his and his croneys' acts
of sedition: http://www.votetoimpeach.org/.  Or if you've the stomach
for it, you can also practice civil disobedience: find those electronic
machines, drag 'em out, pull 'em apart, and find out how they work.

Once again I'm privileged to be able to offer a fine selection of
poems from new and established writers.

In addition to the usual fare of works that push the boundaries of
syntax, poetic structure, and lyric voice, AUGHT no. 13 includes a
section featuring short pieces (or sequences of pieces), under 25
words.

I hope you'll enjoy reading all the wonderful work as much as I have.

If across great seas I'd landed hard

If hacked and savaged on the way,

beside cold water was a place.
It was only love that drove me,
away from war and death.
It was only words that failed me
by the river, out of breath.

If I built a troubled town
of mud and stones and bone and blood,
and shared what secret I had found
with people neither bad nor good.
If I forged blue beads of sand and fire
beside cold water on my knees,
and lay my robes down in desire
while children giggled in the trees.
It was only love that led me.
It was love that drew us near.
I couldn't know that loving me
would make us disappear.

If I planted people sweet and fair
and forged in them my heart and hue;
we will find us waiting there
beside cold water, beads of blue.

power,remember all the 'don't vote for Ralph Nader'
propaganda? well Ralph only got ONE percent and Bush

meanwhile two guys that were in the same fraternity at

Hi Patrick and Listees.

You should read John Pilger's books including - here is my listing of it on
abeboks.com  ie www.abebooks.com


  A Secret Country
Pilger, John

Price: US$ 14.33 (NZ$ 20.00) [Convert Currency]
Shipping: [Rates and Speeds]

 Book Description: London: Jonathan Cape, 1989. Grey Cloth Gold Gilt Titles.
Fine. First Edition. Large 8vo - over 7?" - 9?" Tall. The story of
Australia's history including the injustices to the aboriginees and
interference by the CIA in Australian politics and the "Mates Club".
Fascinating book. Overall with faults Very Good. Bookseller Inventory
#200000001526

Bookseller: Aspect Books (Auckland, AKLD, New Zealand

Lol - a bt of promotion [I see the irony of this as I am advocating a
possible socialist struggle outseide the "system" !! But I can assure all
those that even as amiilionannire my heart wil be with the "struggle"!!
(joke of course)] but I mean it I will discount 10% for listees. (recently
discounted all tese "higher" numbered book by 20% because since Bush got
into poewer the US$ value has dropped about 40 to 50 % (versus the NZ$) I
think..very big. A lot of that is an indicator of the weakmnes onf theUS
economy and also NZ's moderate economic prosperity - probably only
temporary) - hence the desparate need for S11 (US economy was in trouble
then). Hence - see also as most probably you have Michael Moore's films etc

I think that Miuchael Moore is a great person and a great and courageous
American going very public to expose US policies: Pilger also..Chomsky I
believe is good I havent read him -

Think of my friend who is a mechanic in NZ  - his boss went to the film by
Moore Fahrenheit911 and walked out - others: my friend - when I discuss the
sitution in Iraq can only say "but they cyt heads off" ...he doesnt read
(virtually at all - harldy even the Newspapers)...  also many of those
voters in "middle Amreica will be working class, technitians, mechanics etc)
and will hardly ever read anything...many do, but read what confirms thier
opinions (that said,.... we all tend to do that):

The problem now is you need strong activist movemenst that by-pass the
so-called democratic provcces and  "infiltrate the mass of the people with
knowledge - cunning is needed (see Hans Haacke and his use (interest in) of
Bertolt Brecht's method of using/obtaingn or telling the truth - cunning is
needed) and if you can show working people and poor people (many of whom
join the military ) throughout the US that they need to know more, that
their interests are not served by this false and hollow 'democracy' etc
etc - you will have the beginning of major political change but it will
never come via the ballot box....only by direct militant action by the
poeple of the US - intellectusals students and others need to assist in this
revolution.

Clearly it is impossible to "suppress " religion so a new amalgam of Marxixt
and other ideations need to be utilised in the struggle.

Meantime I make a few dollars selling books !!

"I ain't gonna study war no more"

Billy wanted to take a walk with me once, along an isolated beach, but my
beach was next to a stone green primordial sea, next to a failed poison land of
hunger and bitter tears, in a swarming stifling delusionless air, and he had no
pace to his steps, and mine washed away more quickly than he could follow,
and I could not save him from himself, but then he could only do that for
himself anyway. Growing up is hard to do.

But then he had that walk with "dubyah" and got him right with God. And now
"dubyah" doesn't drink or smoke or chew or carouse with real women, so there's
little left of him but the mad dog in the noonday sun. And study war he does,
from deceit to torture, all for King
Jesus. The man is not fit to run a small town jail with any humanity, let
alone be president of the United States. He missed his true calling - the male
Sunday School teacher, who makes the little girls nervously pull at their skirts
in shame before his leering eyes.

Michelangelo loved the human form, like no other before him, and ached and
died to carve and plaster it everywhere around him, consumed in a mad agony for
flesh and blood and bone. And he took a Papal walk with Julius out around the
town and learned to stoop to provide for war. And Jesus took another human
artist off to war, down from the high
places to the stinking battlement, to the demented ecstasy of killing, and
the humiliation of personally sublimated fear, the slaughtered hope for peace
with another. And the bodies were his to explore and to love and to lift up for
all to see, but then they were all dead people on a chapel wall, causalities
of war, and he could climb no higher.

"it's no-go the merry-go-round"

Whether Osiris, Attis, Hyacynth, Hercules, or Jesus, shall we kill the world
to meet them in Elysium or Heaven just because we cannot overcome our jealousy
and fear? So let it be written. So let it be done. Soldier through and chop
them down on right and left and rear
and forward. It's the same old God of war. After all this time we should know
him by the smell. Everyone who believes in God should be with their God. It's
no-go the planetary holocaust, because I'm not sure anything worth saving is
left to be lost, and I'm not sure what really needs to die would ever stay
dead.

Here is the link to Diebold Corp and what put Bush back in the White
House

http://www.diebold.com/dieboldes/

_________________________________________
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- An error with an electronic voting system gave
President Bush 3,893 extra votes in suburban Columbus, elections
officials said.

Franklin County's unofficial results had Bush receiving 4,258 votes to
Democrat John Kerry's 260 votes in a precinct in Gahanna. Records show
only 638 voters cast ballots in that precinct.

Bush actually received 365 votes in the precinct, Matthew Damschroder,
director of the Franklin County Board of Elections, told The Columbus
Dispatch.

State and county election officials did not immediately respond to
requests by The Associated Press for more details about the voting
system and its vendor, and whether the error, if repeated elsewhere in
Ohio, could have affected the outcome.

Bush won the state by more than 136,000 votes, according to unofficial
results, and Kerry conceded the election on Wednesday after
acknowledging that 155,000 provisional ballots yet to be counted in
Ohio would not change the result.
The Secretary of State's Office said Friday it could not revise Bush's
total until the county reported the error.

The Ohio glitch is among a handful of computer troubles that have
emerged since Tuesday's elections.
In one North Carolina county, more than 4,500 votes were lost because
officials mistakenly believed a computer that stored ballots
electronically could hold more data than it did. And in San Francisco,
a malfunction with custom voting software could delay efforts to
declare the winners of four races for county supervisor.

In the Ohio precinct in question, the votes are recorded onto a
cartridge. On one of the three machines at that precinct, a malfunction
occurred in the recording process, Damschroder said. He could not
explain how the malfunction occurred.

Damschroder said people who had seen poll results on the election
board's Web site called to point out the discrepancy. The error would
have been discovered when the official count for the election is
performed later this month, he said.

The reader also recorded zero votes in a county commissioner race on
the machine.

Workers checked the cartridge against memory banks in the voting
machine and each showed that 115 people voted for Bush on that machine.
With the other machines, the total for Bush in the precinct added up to
365 votes.

Meanwhile, in San Francisco, a glitch occurred with software designed
for the city's new "ranked-choice voting," in which voters list their
top three choices for municipal offices. If no candidate gets a
majority of first-place votes outright, voters' second and third-place
preferences are then distributed among candidates who weren't
eliminated in the first round.
When the San Francisco Department of Elections tried a test run on
Wednesday of the program that does the redistribution, some of the
votes didn't get counted and skewed the results, director John Arntz
said.

"All the information is there," Arntz said. "It's just not arriving the
way it was supposed to."

A technician from the Omaha, Neb. company that designed the software,
Election Systems & Software Inc., was working to diagnose and fix the
problem.

yes, but how sweet it is to be loved by the needle
For art, I plan a tatoo of everything or truly anything
Crosses, Mendelbrot set, Cosmic Orgonic Functionalism, some of my ink work
Ousia or another greek word in greek
Some other words I am prone to write
I want to write on everything & die with it

but, considering the money, broke
Instead I tag.
By the way, you're it thingy.

Some Clarification

While everyone understands what is meant by "visual" poetry, some are

poetry (the bricks and mortar) of experimental/avant poets; it is what
most of you write day in and day out. HTH

Subject: Unhappy Democrats Must Wait to Get Into Canada

Published on Thursday, November 4, 2004 by Reuters
Unhappy Democrats Must Wait to Get Into Canada
by David Ljunggren


OTTAWA - Disgruntled Democrats seeking a safe Canadian haven after
President Bush won Tuesday's election should not pack their bags just yet.

Canadian officials made clear on Wednesday that any U.S. citizens so fed
up with Bush that they want to make a fresh start up north would have to
stand in line like any other would-be immigrants -- a wait that can take
up to a year.

"Let me tell you -- if they're hard-working honest people, there's a
process, and let them apply," Immigration Minister Judy Sgro told Reuters.

Asked whether American applicants would get special treatment, she
replied: "No, they'll join the crowd like all the other people who want to
come to Canada."

There are anywhere from 600,000 to a million Americans living in Canada,
which leans more to the left than the United States and has traditionally
favored the Democrats over the Republicans.

But statistics show a gradual decline in U.S. citizens coming to work and
live in Canada, which has an ailing health care system and relatively high
levels of personal taxation.

Government officials, real estate brokers and Democrat activists said that
while some Americans might talk about moving to Canada rather than living
with a new Bush administration, they did not expect a mass influx.

"It's one thing to say 'I'm leaving for Canada' and quite another to
actually find a job here and wonder about where you're going to live and
where the children are going to go to school," said one official.

Roger King of the Toronto-based Democrats Abroad group said he had heard
nothing about a possible exodus of party members.

"I imagine most committed Democrats will want to stay in the United States
and continue being politically active there," he said.

Americans seeking to immigrate can apply to become permanent citizens of
Canada, a process that often takes a year. Becoming a full citizen takes a
further three years.

The other main way to move north on a long-term basis is to find a job,
which in all cases requires a work permit. This takes from four to six
months to come through.

Statistics show the number of U.S. workers entering Canada dropped to
15,789 in 2002 from 21,627 in 2000. In 1981 some 10,030 Americans gained
permanent residency, compared to 5,541 in 2003.

Asked if there had been signs of increased U.S. interest, Sgro said: "Not
yet, but we'll see tomorrow."

The Canadian foreign ministry said there had been no increase in hits on
the Washington embassy's immigration Web site, while housing brokers
doubted they would see a surge in U.S. business.

"Canada's always open and welcoming to Americans who want to relocate
here, but we don't think it would be a trend or movement," said Gino
Romanese of Royal Lepage Residential Real Estate Services.

Those wishing to move to Canada could always take a risk and claim refugee
status -- the path chosen earlier this year by two U.S. deserters who
opposed the Iraq war.

"Anybody who enters Canada who claims refugee status will be provided with
a work permit...it doesn't matter what country they're from," said an
immigration ministry spokeswoman.

Refugee cases are handled by special boards, which can take months to
decide whether to admit applicants. The rulings can be appealed and
opposition politicians complain some people ordered deported have been in
Canada for 10 years or more.

It is becoming a haven for young artists.
By the way, I hear now that 74% of Portlanders voted for Kerry.

The only central depositories of this kind of data would be the DNC & and
RNC.
Otherwise it would have to be accumulated by a third party source (media),
or
pieced together state by state from their election commissions...

And then there's karl Rove's laptop... the one he keeps in the trunk of his
liquid blue fire Jaguar...

It was sad to hear of Clinton saying from his
hospital bed that Kerry NEEDED to EMBRACE
the ban on gay marriage.

Kerry would not listen.

And it wasn't Kerry in bed with
a destroyed and failing heart.

kari, thanks for sending this.

There is a debate I've encountered in the last few days
I'd like to address.  It's being said by people I speak with
and it's being said on news shows that it was not an
anti gay vote, but a vote against gay marriage.

It's getting tired for me, very quickly.  Yes, it WAS and
IS anti gay.  There were no gloves on those fists in
the voting booths.

A coworker--with the best intentions--said, "Well I would
think that gay bashing will now be at an all time low since
so many people think gays are put in their place.  And
that's a good thing."

As nice as it may be to hear someone try to find the positive,
it's simply not true.  There is a recklessness that goes
along with the victor who won on moral ground.

When I was outed in my redneck town as a kid AIDS was
making the news at the same time.  Reagan's moral stand
to shun the subject set the grounds for horrible treatment
of gay people all over this country.  Firsthand I know this.

If gay people can literally be kicked when they're down
and so many are dying, there certainly will be no
hesitation to beat and kill gays any less now.

William Fox is a poet, artist, critic, and essayist. He has published
fifteen collections of poetry, and six books of nonfiction about art,
cognition, and landscape. He was the editor of West Coast Poetry Review
magazine and books from 1972 to 1988, which published poets as disparate as
William Stafford and Ian Hamilton Finlay, and was one of the few presses in
the United States at the time to give serious attention to concrete poetry.
For the past ten years he has been a full-time writer, whose research takes
him to some of the most remote regions on the planet. He currently resides
in Los Angeles.
      Recent books of poetry include Reading Sand: Selected Desert  Poems,
1975-2000 (University of Nevada) and One Wave Standing (La  Alameda Press);
of nonfiction, Playa Works: The Myth of the Empty  (University of Nevada)
and The Void, the Grid, and the Sign: Traversing the Great Basin (University
of Utah). He lives in Los Angeles, where he has recently completed books on
the Antarctic (Tierra Antarctica) and Las Vegas (In the Desert of Desire),
forthcoming from Trinity University and University of Nevada, respectively,
and is working on a book about Mars.


David Abel is a poet, editor, bookseller, raga singer, and poker player who
moved to Portland in 1997. One of the instigators of the Spare Room reading
series, his recent publications include A Reading of a Reading of Ashes

I do not know why people voted they way they did.. but if a party can
not press the issues or folks are more concerned about abortion, queers
and whether creationism is being taught in schools, instead of a raging
war, a 7 trillion dollar deficit, HIV-AIDS crisis, pollution, global
warming, massive world civil rights violation (including the sudan -
where rape seems to be a past time), water shortages, oil storages.. on
and on.. well then.. maybe they are either making excuses and look for
a scapegoat or they are asking the wrong question...

I think it show just how insular the population is...

Bill CLinton's urge for expediancy should never
me underestimated:

- a few short weeks before the New Hampshire Primary,
he moved up, yes, moved forward... the execution of a
partially brain-damaged man on death row (one, who
incidently suffered the brain damge while on death row);

- hele out the campaign-time hope of changing the military's
stand on gays in service, only to drop it flat two months
into his first term... never again to re-visit the issue.

With the Clintons, be wary and verify often.

There will be a memorial in honor of the more than 200,000+ Iraqi =
civilians killed since the U.S. invasion/occupation of the "tiny country =
with big oil."

Supporters are asking  that on January 20, 2005, people wear "white" in =
rememberance to those innocent "people of color" who have lost their =
lives due to corporate greed and religion-sanctioned genocide for oil.

 Mobilis in Mobili Poetry Prize

$1000 prize and book publication from BlazeVOX [books]

Moving within the moving element! or changing through change! This is Nemo's
motto for his Nautilus and it seems all too fitting for our poetry prize.
There is something happening right now in poetry that is very exciting. It
is neither a recreation of Stein's salon nor is it a thing of substance to
fill the empty souls of man. There is something coming down like the winds
outside, the rainfall. Something that speaks like the rains outside. It's
all moving but not necessarily moving towards a specific direction. And in
this contest we are in hope of promoting this underrated work.

Book Description:  A collection of codework poems written by Sondheim
while at the Virtual Environment Lab, a research center at West Virginia
University, where he visited during the summer of 2004. Baldwin says in
his intro, "Sondheim's work is important for its problematic status, as
the result of and still part of the work of digital media. As digital
writing in a strong sense, Sondheim's writing appears problematically
coded - problematic because it is decodable neither as "human-readable" or
"machine-readable" but suspended between."

[from] vellum, velocity: an introduction to VEL
by Sandy Baldwin, charles.baldwin@mail.wvu.edu

The dictionary tells us that VEL is an abbreviation for vellum, a
fine-grained opaque or almost-translucent parchment made from lambskin or
calfskin. Vellum is a sensuous, reflective surface. The written word is
lit up through the stretched and cured skin. VEL also abbreviates
velocity, probably derived from a Latin root for liveliness, today defined
as the rate of speed, a derivative of movement through time. The VEL in
the title of Alan Sondheim's new book VEL is the acronym for something
quite different: Virtual Environment Lab, a research center at West
Virginia University, where Sondheim visited and explored during the summer
of 2004. Sondheim's collaboration with computer scientists exploited
creative mis-use and adaptation of the technologies at the VEL, disrupting
and re-distributing built-in assumptions about the imaging and integrity
of the human body and the capture of the "real." The experiments at the
VEL, preliminary as they were, established the fascination of the problem
of "liveness" in virtual environments. Sondheim worked with clusters of
data drawn from motion capture systems to map and drive animations,
videos, texts, and other artifacts. These data clusters, in their
aggregate state as "clusters," capture motion and "life." The results are
beautiful and moving, very alien and very human, enigmatic and intimate.
Some of the writings collected here are direct results of his work at the
VEL; all were written during Sondheim's visit. And so, the meeting of
linguistic roots and corporate-strength acronym is appropriate. Sondheim
writes on the organic matter of vellum and the velocity of bodies in
motion. The technicality of being live and the already virtual velocity of
written life is very much the concern here. Sondheim's writing is best
described through his own term "codework, the computer stirring into the
text, and the text stirring the computer." So, a first take on VEL is its
relation to the computer. ... His work is opaquely illuminated by the net.


One might think of Alan Sondheim as the Joyce of our time. Too big while
he's here among us, or while we're here among him, to get our heads around
what he's done and is doing.On the other hand, it's clear he doesn't want
to be our Joyce at all, in deliberate, un-scrolling process as he is of
immolating himself, incinerating any last trace of canonical identity in a
stupendous bonfire of poetry, code, and secret philosophy. What "Joyce"
shall be left? What "Sondheim"? A monk burns in full view and the blaze
refuses to go out. We're here watching, startled and baffled, contemptuous
and titillated. That we don't quite know what fuels the seemingly mystical
act renders the transfiguration all the more unsettling and marvelous.
Kent Johnson

Sondheim's writing refreshes. Narrative or persistent personality the
reader constructs will resist. It's funny output, coded, destabilising. It
projects, expands and redirects personal need, hunger amidst insubstantial
plenty, where the real material is imaginary. Writing without purpose;
purposeful writing; not delivery of contentment or white space infill.
Writing as individuation of multipliers where what is familiar is parodic
as it is manifested, cyborgian tenacity creating its selves in process
awareness, sans merci. I is mindful of being confederated awareness.
Peripheral desiring bodies remain animal, alone and palely loitering
during downtime, mammals with machines, sensuous making intellects.
Lawrence Upton

Alan Sondheim co-founded the Cybermind and Wryting email lists online. He
is editor of Being on Line and author of .echo and Disorders of the Real.
His latest book, The Wayward, of the Salt Modern Poets books series, is
now available. He publishes widely on Net issues, and his video/sound work
is internationally exhibited. He lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his
partner, Azure Carter, and their cat, Boojum.

[ Excerpt from VEL ]


Cutting the Timber


A man lay down across the threshold of the kitchen outside, head within.
He was to represent the saw. Two players now took hold of his feet
outside, while two others caught his head and shoulders in the kitchen.
They pulled against one another, forward and backwards, as if they were
sawing wood, until one pair proved too strong for the other.

- Irish Wake Amusements, Sean O Suilleabhain, Mercier, cork, 1967, p. 82.

the ocean divides one world from another.
there is no gravity in division.
worlds bracket the ocean.
new worlds bracket old oceans and new oceans.
the horizon bends crazily with the disorientation of the wounded.
troop ships sank quickly in the frigid waters.
the _bow_ of the ship _ploughs_ a _furrow_ through the waters.
no one is present in this landscape.
no one is looking.


it is so clean i am sure you will be very happy.

Subject:      too fast
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

In Mexico City an endless river of human dead pours over the wheel of a great
mill erected to process the division of life from the living and recycle and
perpetuate the irreconcilable difference between thinking things. The planet
expresses the Americas from this high place with its stinking air and blanched
sensibilities and unreliable stars. In a quantum sense we could be endless,
but the spin of things, the concentration of thought, the frantic chasing of
tails, the sheer velocity of expression, confounds our relative self-perception,
and leaves us unnoticeable to ourselves. What we express goes by faster than
we are capable of remembering, and so unaccounted for in our perception of our
cosmic reality. If I have fucked for an afternoon, I can never have it again,
though it is never gone, because an afternoon is too short to notice in the
span of eternal reality, moving too fast to have. If I have raised a child, I
cannot have it, because it happened too fast to find again, though it is never
gone. If I have written words that stay in print for thousands of years I
cannot find them, though they are never gone, for thousands of years is not
measurable in eternity, it goes by too fast to notice. We think. We should be asking
why we think so fast. Everything always is. We have just set it moving to fast
to notice, and so it seems to end. In Mexico City men who think of extension,
men who think of survival, men who dream of posterity, men who tweak the
control of the spin and speed ever higher, come to parlay with speed merchants,
who open emotional windows all over the planet, and sell intellectual wagons to
flee and flick about the depth of thinking things, and sell choices to talk or
not to talk, to hear or not to hear, to turn men into cities, into nations,
into races, to sort and divide and choose, oh horribly choose, the moment: for
men cannot go fast enough keep the moment and so become what they emulate:
cosmic tramps, transients, self-dispossessed speed inflicted vagabonds. And so
the planet becomes the mill, the farm, where unrealized things are built to
disappear, where it is pragmatic to sort by color; all controlled by the speed of
enlightened civilization, and men seeking an escape to untenable momentary
comfort by going faster and faster. There is always movement and rest. Speed does
not kill, for nothing is ever gone, but rather it imprisons and can imprison
forever, even in quantum theory. We have seen both faces now. In Mexico City
Jean got the blues. In Mexico City I could not see the sky, it passed by so
fast.

Subject:      living from poem to poem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

The following is snipped from Laura Riding's official website maintained by
UNC:

She brought to the poetic practice and theory of the day much-needed
visionary insights into the roots of poetry's nature and being--roots identified as
located in lasting humanly good and truthful values. Those values had existed
hitherto half-glimpsed by poets here and there in isolation, but had not been
comprehensively formulated as a whole. The poetic climate of the day was one of
stale disillusionment, concerning itself with the expression of a cynical
technique of disillusion; into this climate Laura Riding tried to breathe, with
all she wrote, values of wholeness of thinking and being. For her, poetry was
truth, and a poem 'an uncovering of truth of so fundamental and general a kind
that no other name besides poetry is adequate except truth.' She saw poetry as
having come to a stage of finality in history where the practice of it became
'more real than existence in time--more real because more good, more good
because more true.' Poetry, in her view, offered a practical and immediately
attainable final reality of being:

'To live in, by, for the reasons of, poems is to habituate oneself to the
good existence. When we are so continuously habituated that there is no temporal
interruption between one poetic incident (poem) and another, then we have not
merely poems--we have poetry; we have not merely the immediacies--we have
finality. Literally.'

Those three quotations are taken from the Preface to Laura Riding's Collected
Poems (1938). Writing of that volume in 1939, the poet and critic Robert
Fitzgerald--who was later to produce widely-admired translations of Homer, and who
was appointed Boylston Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard--said:

'Of all the contemporary poems I know, these seem to me the furthest
advanced, the most personal and the purest. I hope, but hardly believe, that they will
be assimilated soon into the general consciousness of literature. The
authority, the dignity of truth telling, lost by poetry to science, may gradually be
regained. If it is, these poems should one day be a kind of Principia. They
argue that the art of language is the most fitting instrument with which to
press upon full reality and make it known.'' (Kenyon Review, 1939, pp. 341-345)

I am pleased and proud to announce the inauguration of a new reading

A bit about the poets:

JESS MYNES lives in Wendell, MA with dog and cat. His poems have appeared
in Pettycoat Relaxer and Carve magazine. Two chapbooks of his poems, Thin
and The Zookeeper’s Nostalgia, were published by Staple Gun Productions.
He is an expert sausage maker. He has a forthcoming collaboration with
Aaron Tieger, as well as a forthcoming chapbook from Anchorite Press. He
works as a librarian.

CHRISTOPHER RIZZO earned his M.A. in Creative Writing from Boston
University in 2001. His poems have appeared in several publications, most
recently in Art New England, Can We Have Our Ball Back?, and Shampoo.
After receiving the S. Andrea Brown Memorial Award in poetry, a short
collection of his poems, The Turn, was produced as a play by the Oral
Interpretation Society at Emerson. His latest chapbook, Grim Little, is a
long collaborative poem written with Mark Lamoureux. He is also the
founder and editor of the Anchorite Press, which publishes chapbooks,
pamphlets, and broadsides by both established and young poets. He lives in
Brighton, Massachusetts.

Hello everyone,

Five pieces by Karl Young have been added to Blackbox's Fall 2004 gallery.
The Fall gallery is a tribute to the pioneering visual poet, Bill Keith
1929-2004.

As always, go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link.  Then
stroll (scroll) through the galleries until you come to the tribute.

Since we at Koja Press published Bill's final book, I will probably be adding
Karl Young's Afterward from that publication to the site shortly.  Look for
it.

Best, Bill

WORKSHOPS

The Art of Transformation
Instructors:  Jimmie Gilliam and Laurie Dean Torrell
3 Tuesdays, 11/16, 11/23, and 11/30 from 6:30-8:30
In The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo
$90, $75 for members

Transformations offer an opportunity to enlarge imagination and expand the
sense of what is possible in both life and artistic work. Beginning again -
suspending judgement, re-framing the familiar, being willing to change
direction - these artistic practices can be employed to navigate times of
change, and can be used to create new work.  In this workshop we will mine
experience, and use the texts The Art of Possibility: Transforming
Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander,
and Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go by Shaun McNiff.
Through discussion and writing exercises we will explore the subject of
transformation.  Participants will have the opportunity to create and share
original essays and poems, and within the three-week period, receive
individual critique if desired.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Ladies and gentlemen, drop your borders

Now that George W. Bush has been officially elected, single, sexy,
American liberals - already a threatened species - will be desperate to
escape. These lonely, afraid (did we mention really hot?) progressives
will need a safe haven.

You can help. Open your heart, and your home. Marry an American. Legions
of Canadians have already pledged to sacrifice their singlehood to save
our southern neighbours from four more years of cowboy conservatism.

Dead Carnival, by Mark Wallace

Cover Art by Tim Davis

A scientist creates gilled human monstrosities that are also avatars of the possibility of imaginative transcendence. Dark dreams liberate and dismember simultaneously, invoking a freedom beyond the body that can only appear through the act of mutilation. Mark Wallace's Dead Carnival rages against a world in which corpsed imagination roams in the form of the everyday. Experimentation in language and in the laboratory produce equally vertiginous results-a hammerhead shark-human who insists on sacrosanct purity as a justification for revenge, westerns that leave their grained and scratched frames strewn across a desert landscape, a lost town with a museum full of mutant skeletons, a ghost-mound of white prairie dogs, Dante's Beatrice wandering through a contemporary purgatory, bodies that transmute into dreams and weave themselves into text, and much more.

Wallace's prose is an eloquent challenge to the arbitrary boundaries that we place between novelistic prose, philosophy, dream, fantasy, pop cultural artifact, and poetry. To enter this book is to fragment and dissect, to become a reader with scissors suturing meaning together while cutting flesh fragments into the void. Read this text and become part of this beautiful dead-corpse carnival in which the dead circulate through language and through us.

*

In these worlds, ideas and narratives flurry madly and wink out like sparks, the dead walk, and the monstrous is never far away. Part Lovecraft, part de Sade, part B-horror movie, part philosophy, Dead Carnival is a schizophrenic and uniquely American Novel of Ideas. --Brian Evenson

Mark Wallace writes like John Hawkes dreaming of Paul Bowles having a gothic nightmare. --Ron Sukenick

Astragaloi
by Mark Jarman

We know there must be consciousness in things,
        In bits of gravel pecked up by a hen
To grind inside her coop, and spider silk
        Just as it hardens stickily in air,
And even those things paralyzed in place,
        The wall brick, the hat peg, the steel beam
Inside the skyscraper, and lost, forgotten,
        And buried in ancient tombs, the toys and games.
Those starry jacks, those knucklebones of glass
        Meant for the dead to play with, toss and catch
Back of the hand and read the pattern of,
        Diversions to beguile the endless time,
Never to be picked up again...They're thinking,
        Surely, all of them. They are lost in thought.=20

excerpt...



Last Chance Saloon, neon lights, strawberry Margarita

L. A. entertainment attorney says he won't SHOP tapes

Then utters the sacred name of Madonna

"If you got something that's right,

I can always talk to her people"

A lonely promise made to an Oklahoma boy

Who left his high-school sweetheart back on the farm

Now he's gone off and joined a posse of Hat Acts



Up on Music Row

comes the welcome wagon

broken spokes clatter on asphalt



Randy Travis Western Wear

Ernest Tubbs Record Shop

Country Music Hall of Fame

broken spokes on asphalt . . .



Songwriter Chamber of Commerce president

White billows of treated hair teased

Green eyes sparkle

Empty jewelry box head

Wrinkles sealed with equestrian grooming powders

Ruby lips,

"So, what's a Jew doing in Nashville?"

"Why Ma'am," he says, disguises truculent Brooklynisms

"I came to write a Hit Song!"




Why just last night I wrote three hit songs with Dolly Jones

then stopped off for some honey-cured baked ham

whipped potatoes, collard greens, white beans, cornbread

and a heart to heart talk about genocide at Rotier's


"So why did Hitler kill all those Jews?" she asks

through the din of lunching Hit Men and Hank Williams

Sr.'s ghost on the juke box

"I'm so lonesome I could cry"


"He needed a scapegoat for a national depression"

"Why didn't the Jews accept Jesus?"


The silver-haired, motherly waitress

has a tattoo on the inside of her thigh

An indigo cowboy mounted on a bucking dragon

and the motto: "Born to ride"

She clears the green Formica table

Sets down two checks for a total of $12.76

"They were thinking of a different kind of Messiah"

"Oh", says Dolly Jones. She pays as a friendly gesture




What a world

What a lonesome world!

The Plaintext project is concerned with the agency and programming of =
writing technologies. Plaintext Tools is a listserv and portal for =
writers, artists, and thinkers, with the goal of creating and publishing =
original research, providing resources, and fostering community around the =
tools and methods of writing technologies. A full description of the =
project, as well as info on subscribing to the list, is here: http://www.as=

Why Plaintext Tools? There is an emerging discourse and contested canon of =
digital media writing, art, and theory. There are conferences, special =
issues, exhibits, and archives of this work. Yet access and knowledge =
about tools is limited.  Digital artist and writer Alan Sondheim points =
out that most computer users "work on or within graphic surfaces that are =
intricately connected to the programming 'beneath'; they have little idea =
how or why their machines work." Similarly, he argues, for "thousands of =
years, writers have [...] taken their tools * taken writing itself * for =
granted." There are significant exceptions, of course, but there is no =
center or organization for research and understanding the agency programmin=
g of writing technology and artistic software. At best, there are =
corporate enterprise or "office" tools that are worked around and through =
by writers, artists, and thinkers. Of course, there are artist-produced =
tools and add-ons, which maintain a parasitic relation to the dominant =
technologies. Legislations like the TCPA threaten even this relation, =
shutting off the computer to all but authorized users. The "proper" use of =
software is increasingly materialized in hardware. As a result, there is a =
dispersed and itinerant knowledge of how to operate with software, a =
bricolage or tactical knowledge of "making do." Our goal is to gather this =
knowledge, to create an archive of these techniques, and to project the =
future of digital writing, art, and theory, in terms of its agency and =
programming at the level of tools.=20

The Sona Books 2004 World Tour continues in Brooklyn
this Sunday, November 14, at 7:30 pm at the Magnetic Field Cocktail Lounge,
97 Atlantic Avenue, BKLYN, (718) 834-0069.
Take the 2/3 or 4/5 to Borough Hall, F/A/C to Jay Street to hear
Joanna Sondheim, Jennifer Firestone, Ellen Baxt and Alicia Askenase
read from new and newer work.

Their chapbooks will be there for sale, the event is free,
and I'm sorry we're competing with the Zinc Bar Reading--
(sorry Mark and Albert!)
but if you haven't seen these writers read,
and if you feel like being in cozy Brooklyn on a Sunday,
this reading might be right for you.

Go to www.magneticbrooklyn.com for more info about the venue
and to to www.sonaweb.net for more info about the press.

best,
Jill Magi

Subject:      Whacko to Head Up FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory
              Committee
Comments: To: frankfurt-school@lists.village.virginia.edu,
          corp-focus@lists.essential.org, WRYTING-L@LISTSERV.UTORONTO.CA

President Bush has announced his plan to select Dr. W. David Hager
to head up the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Reproductive Health
Drugs Advisory Committee. The committee has not met for more than
two years, during which time its charter lapsed. As a result, the Bush
Administration is tasked with filling all eleven positions with new
members. This position does not require Congressional approval. The
FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee makes crucial
decisions on matters relating to drugs used in the practice of
obstetrics, gynecology and related specialties, including hormone
therapy, contraception, treatment for infertility, and medical
alternatives to surgical procedures for sterilization and pregnancy
termination.

Dr. Hager, the author of "As Jesus Cared for Women: Restoring Women
Then and Now." The book blends biblical accounts of Christ healing Women
with case studies from Hager's practice. His views of reproductive health
care are far outside the mainstream for reproductive technology. Dr.
Hager is a practicing OB/GYN who describes himself as "pro-life" and
refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women. In the book
Dr.Hager wrote with his wife, entitled "Stress and the Woman's
Body," he suggests that women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome should
seek help from reading the bible and praying. As an editor and
contributing author of "The Reproduction Revolution: A Christian Appraisal of
Sexuality Reproductive Technologies and the Family," Dr. Hager
appears to have endorsed the medically inaccurate assertion that the common
birth control pill is an abortifacient.

We are concerned that Dr. Hager's strong religious beliefs may
color his assessment of technologies that are necessary to protect women's
lives for to preserve and promote women's health. Hager's track record of
using religious beliefs to guide his medical decision-making makes
him a dangerous and inappropriate candidate to serve as chair of this
committee. Critical drug public policy and research must not be held
hostage by antiabortion politics. Members of this important panel
should be appointed on the basis of science and medicine, rather than
politics and religion. American women deserve no less. There is something you
can do. Below is a statement to be sent to the White House, opposing the
placement of Hager.


(1) Please copy and paste (DON'T forward) the entire email into a
fresh
email; then sign your name below. After you sign, SEND THIS TO EVERY
PERSON YOU KNOW WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.

(2) Every 10th person who signs the list (i.e., #10, #20, #30,
etc.) -
please forward the entire e-mail to president@whitehouse.gov


We oppose the appointment of Dr. W. David Hager to the FDA
Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee. Mixing religion and medicine is
unacceptable in a policy-making position. Using the FDA to promote a
religious political agenda is inappropriate in a pluralistic society and
seriously threatens women's health. Members of this important panel should be
appointed on the
basis of science and medicine, rather than politics and religion.

American women deserve no less.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Before it's too late!

Write to your representative right now about The Voter Confidence and
Increased Accessibility Act of 2003

Look up HR 2239 and find out about the bill that's stalled in Congress
for a reason...they don't want fair elections.

Subject: Whacko to Head Up FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory
Committee

President Bush has announced his plan to select Dr. W. David Hager
to head up the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Reproductive Health
Drugs Advisory Committee. The committee has not met for more than
two years, during which time its charter lapsed. As a result, the Bush
Administration is tasked with filling all eleven positions with new
members. This position does not require Congressional approval. The
FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee makes crucial
decisions on matters relating to drugs used in the practice of
obstetrics, gynecology and related specialties, including hormone
therapy, contraception, treatment for infertility, and medical
alternatives to surgical procedures for sterilization and pregnancy
termination.

Dr. Hager, the author of "As Jesus Cared for Women: Restoring Women
Then and Now." The book blends biblical accounts of Christ healing Women
with case studies from Hager's practice. His views of reproductive
health
care are far outside the mainstream for reproductive technology. Dr.
Hager is a practicing OB/GYN who describes himself as "pro-life" and
refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women. In the book
Dr.Hager wrote with his wife, entitled "Stress and the Woman's
Body," he suggests that women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome
should
seek help from reading the bible and praying. As an editor and
contributing author of "The Reproduction Revolution: A Christian
Appraisal of
Sexuality Reproductive Technologies and the Family," Dr. Hager
appears to have endorsed the medically inaccurate assertion that the
common
birth control pill is an abortifacient.

We are concerned that Dr. Hager's strong religious beliefs may
color his assessment of technologies that are necessary to protect
women's
lives for to preserve and promote women's health. Hager's track record
of
using religious beliefs to guide his medical decision-making makes
him a dangerous and inappropriate candidate to serve as chair of this
committee. Critical drug public policy and research must not be held
hostage by antiabortion politics. Members of this important panel
should be appointed on the basis of science and medicine, rather than
politics and religion. American women deserve no less. There is
something you
can do. Below is a statement to be sent to the White House, opposing the
placement of Hager.


(1) Please copy and paste (DON'T forward) the entire email into a
fresh
email; then sign your name below. After you sign, SEND THIS TO EVERY
PERSON YOU KNOW WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.

(2) Every 10th person who signs the list (i.e., #10, #20, #30,
etc.) -
please forward the entire e-mail to president@whitehouse.gov


We oppose the appointment of Dr. W. David Hager to the FDA
Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee. Mixing religion and
medicine is
unacceptable in a policy-making position. Using the FDA to promote a
religious political agenda is inappropriate in a pluralistic society and
seriously threatens women's health. Members of this important panel
should be
appointed on the
basis of science and medicine, rather than politics and religion.

American women deserve no less.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire --
in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The
dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a
prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is
poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the
slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without
first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Your Star Spangled Manner



Jimi the world has moved on since you've gone.

You moved me so with your star spangled song.

You put magic in your playing with your feedback and notes,

the beautiful sounds you created and the songs that you wrote.

Your creative innovation had never been seen.

The way your guitar sounded was almost obscene.

Staccato bonafied kickass rhythm and blues

with the throttle opened up and nothing to lose.

The controversy created by your version of our banner,

was truly a symphony played in your unique manner.

In my house my Father said it just wasn't right.

Our discussion lead to an argument and fight.

I pointed to the feeling you expressed with this song.

How America had become Ill, with many things wrong.

When I listen, I hear children's napalm screams.

Intense hope and yearning for the American dream.

Prejudice and hatred passed from father to son

But in spite of all these problems a new day has begun.

You gave us all hope in our desperate time of need.

Told us love and understanding would overtake greed.=20

The Lannan Poetry Series at Georgetown University presents:

Charles Amirkhanian and Jaap Blonk
"The Sound of Text"

Wednesday November 10, 2004
Seminar: ICC 462, 5:30 p.m.
Reading: ICC 115, 8 p.m.


Composer, percussionist, sound poet, and radio producer, Charles Amirkhanian
is a leading practitioner of electroacoustic music and text-sound
composition. In his recent works, Amirkhanian incorporates environmental
sounds and musically pitched sounds. He is currently Executive & Artistic
Director of the new music organization Other Minds, Inc. in San Francisco.


World-renowned Dutch sound poet Jaap Blonk is a composer and voice performer
of remarkable ingenuity and power. Working in the tradition of early
twentieth century Dada, Blonk explores the rich common ground between poetry
and music through combinations and patterns of voiced sound. Blonk is the
founder and leader of Splinks, a 15-piece orchestra and BRAAXTAAL, an
avant-rock trio.

Right above my desk is a picture of Hillary
Clinton with Hoa Nguyen; the two meeting in some
kind of corridor, looks like a gov't building with
classical sculpture and painting on the walls, Hoa
looking very smart in a kimono-type top and
Hillary in a double-breasted business suit, and
her arm extended as if she's about to give Hoa a
hug... (This image was used for a SPT flier for a
workshop Hoa was teaching, the message apparently
being --- what? That poets can -- well, maybe not
hobnob, but at least meet "legislators" on equal
footing?)

At any rate, I'd like to be the first to nominate
Hoa Nguyen for the Next President of the United
States. She's certainly more "viable" in my mind
than Hillary.

As Bill Maher put it: you have to admire the dedication of the Democrats. As
soon as they lose one election, they're busy thinking about how to lose the
next one.

I have fewer reservations about Hillary Rodham Clinton than you do, and I
would also support her if it came down to it, but unless something big
changes within the Democratic Party and its ability to talk to people in the
Republican Zones, Hillary Clinton is unelectable.

Of course, something should--must, had better--change in the Democratic
Party. The more I think about it the more I realize that the strength of a
candidate is the strength of the party, and not the other way around.

Beat Thing is part poetry and part expos=E9, both tribute to the down in =
the street wildness and rant against the romantic commodification which =
surrounds the Beat Generation. During the late1950s, David Meltzer was =
an active poet in the San Francisco North Beach scene often reading with =
jazz musicians at various bars and coffeehouses.

Unhurried Vision, a year in the life of Michael Rothenberg, is really a =
deeply loving celebration & farewell to mentor Philip Whalen, poet, =
roshi, & all around confounder of boundaries. A day-book; a non-epic =
odyssey through routes & roots of living & dying; a gastronome's =
pleasure dome, but above all a deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of =
poetry's centrality in realizing mundane & profound instances in the =
everyday extraordinary.

Did anyone else read -- I think it was in Harper's
about a year ago -- a long article on Karl Rove in
which he describes seeing George W. Bush for the
first time -- during the 70s -- one of the most
homoerotic descriptions of another man you're
likely to see -- "he was wearing a bomber jacket
and tight blue jeans with a can of skoal in the
back pocket" "the most charismatic man I'd ever
seen" (I'm paraphrasing here, but sombody should
look it up)

I have read so many laments on this listserv since the election.

The fact is that most poets are fat, happy and comfortable living in an
ivory tower of their thoughts- most poets in this country are not engaged in
political discourse- I recently had a chapbook rejected because the magazine
'does not do political verse' what other kind of verse is there? Where are
our political poets?

If the Left in the USA wants to win they have to be willing to fight a war
of ideas, that means arguing why the Neo-Liberal (conservative in the
American lexicon) is not good for people. The Right argues that we are a
nation of 'rugged individualists'a nation of Believers (Read Protestant
Christians), a nation of Small Business People who love autonomy, Gun Owners
who will not have there rights taken away. This liefest allows them to
continue to serve the needs of their corporate donors who by the way are the
same donors to the Democrats by keeping a true discourse out of elections.

The Right continues to use these arguments to win the political discourse in
this country. It is not because the right has more money, they dont, or that
they control the media, they dont but it is because they are persistent and
they continue to say the same things over and over until they are taken as
truth even if they are not. I am frankly tired American 'intellectuals'
lamenting how stupid Americans are for voting for Bush. The fact is that
they are not stupid they were given two choices and they chose the real
thing over a watered down alternative.

The fact is that the left in the USA need to make the following type of
arguments and if they did they would win elections;

1) Globalization is occuring but it is not making us richer as a whole
nation we as a nation need to do all we can to mitigate the fact that whole
industries have been wiped out in this country and this needs to be done by
the government setting priorities so that our nation does not go into a
decline.

2) A key to the right to life is the right not to be sick we need to find a
way to get affordable healthcare to everyone regardless of their job status
or ability to pay it is not moral that people are made destitute because
they were in a Car accident or because they have a pre-mature childbirth and
the nation will work to make healthcare accessable.

3) All American children deserve the same education regardless of where they
live we do not allow other government services to vary by where one lives so
why should education which is a government program vary the Democrats should
be in favor or equalizing ALL schools in funding and facilities regardless
of where they are and districts that have large tax bases should help those
that do not to make this happen.

4) We are a nation that is dependent on Foreign Oil and this makes us
vulnerable to attack and blackmail, we need to end this so we are going to
tax energy and use that money to build in every city and around the nation
high quality mass transit.


I think that if the left argued from these type of grounds they could win
but they are going to have to fight a war of ideas and win people over. That
is the reason the left lost in this election because they failed to win the
war of ideas.

If you google the phrase "Bush mandate," the website that currently
comes up first (as of 2:00p Eastern on Nov. 9) is "Mandate Magazine,"
the cover of which boasts of such articles as "Het Hunk's Butt-Naked
Spread" and "Jockstrap Love: Kickboxer Gang-Bang."

This link was recently posted to another list I'm on.
The site it points to features several maps of the
election results, some by state, others by county,
size area altered to correspond to population. It's
well worth taking a look at:

Bush's Brain has been airing on the Sundance channel -- well worth
recording -- I particularly enjoyed the readings from the 15 page letter
Rove sent to the authors after he got an illicit copy of the manuscript --

Yeah, but then the Dems would have to get out of bed with their own
moneyed interests, which is what I said the other day, Haas. They are
the same party.

well---there is something in this argument re the left's failure,
that ray references, that keeps popping up here, and which i'm
puzzled by, frankly:

i don't think the south-rural or west-rural (or north or east-rural)
inhabitants of the u.s. are stupid, no... i do believe, however,
that, like many in the u.s. but perhaps in greater proportions,
they're misinformed... this may not be the reason why rural areas
went bush, of course (or, one might add, why metro areas went kerry),
since there's the sticky matter of whether these residents "chose" to
be misinformed (here we get into all manner of ideological
speculation)... and i'm not even sure whether, e.g., suburban
evangelicals aren't a better litmus of what just went down... but my
point is thus:  if 60% of the u.s. public still thinks hussein had
something to do with 9/11, this means that they're not listening,
and/or that they don't want to listen, and/or that they're listening
to the wrong people... whatever the case, they're

WRONG

by all accounts, based on what we know today, as of this writing...

now, being wrong does not necessarily imply stupidity, and being
wrong never stopped anyone from casting a ballot... i mentioned on
this list louis menand's article in ~the new yorker~ a few months
back, a great piece on why voters vote the way they do... there are
people who study such matters, and while it remains unclear perhaps
as to how informed the u.s. electorate is, voting habits are
decidedly whimsical, often based on a disparagingly few factors (or
perceived factors), and what's more, *reliably* so...

to move voters is one thing, though, to alter beliefs is another... i
suspect some combination of electioneering tactics and revaluation
(of beliefs) is the way out of this mess we're in... i don't know how
to go about this, no---changing the rhetoric doesn't necessarily mean
a change in the discourse, and changing the discourse doesn't
necessarily mean changing attitudes... how to convince people, for
instance, that an economic policy has everything to do with morality.

but while i don't myself hail from rural stock (so to speak), the
sentiment i'm expressing here, like the argument i'm making, is not
about facing some music (i.e., reality) that i've hitherto refused to
accept (as i like to believe i damn well know what folks in rural
areas think, ok?---having spent enough time around same)... the
reality that needs to be confronted is not simply a metro vs. retro
divide, or an urban vs. rural divide, or a sectarian vs. secular
divide, or what have you (though these terms all designate factors in
what's just transpired, sure)...

to me the larger issue turns on how to develop an informed
electorate, and like mark weiss of a few posts back, i'm not sure how
we get from A to Z on this one... it's not that i believe the truth
will necessarily set us free, you understand, but when you witness,
in a state like wisconsin, a move to put creationism on equal footing
with evolutionary theory (i.e., in the classroom), you have to wonder
whether even serious election reform measures---i.e., taking the
money out of politics---will give us back a democracy worth the
powder to blow to hell... appealing to voters interests is well and
good, but voters, it seems to me, should be voting not on the basis
of their interests, or on the basis even of this willowy construction
we call "conscience"---which, if you ask people, ends up meaning
everything from opinion to conviction to individual salvation---but
on the basis of what's best for the country, and for the globe...
that is, on the basis of something greater than oneself or one's kin
or one's kind, as conflicted as this might prove to be in practice...

best,

I agree with some of what you're saying. Particularly, I'd like to see the
"globalization" issue addressed, though I'm uncomfortable with the imposed
term, much in the way that the "Patriot Act" intentionally disparages its
detractors.

Democrats  simply will not mention how the WTO & IMF spread terror. Their
restrictions for membership force the privatization of services that once
were provided by the state in Arab nationalist, quasi-socialist nations.
Islamists filled the void in healthcare & services that the people were
accustomed to. Charities with Islamist ties have bought their way into the
hearts & minds of the disenfranchised. But I guess that's what the free
market's all about.

I disagree with your point about the poets, though. Some are "fat, happy &
comfortable"- sure. But the best of the poets I know are outraged at the
current regime & out on the street in public action. I recently attended an
event hosted by CHAIN, featuring its latest issue on public forms. It was a
discussion/presentation of the public political works of Alan Gilbert,
Theodore Harris, Kristin Prevallet, Sarah Riggs, Tracie Morris, Kaia Sand &
Anne Waldman. I was both energized & inspired by the work these folks are
doing. I don't think we have to worry about apolitical poets as a cultural
problem. There were always poets & journals who shunned "political" work.
And there always will be.
Other poets & journals are working hard to test power in significant ways.

Please pass this on to those in these states who might have personal =
information to provide.


  See also Election Fraud blog with many links =
<http://radtimes.blogspot.com/>


  Everyone! Please forward to all who have specifics on vote fraud.  The =
send-to address below is John Kerry's brother at his law firm.  Kerry =
will unconcede if there is solid evidence of fraud.  We need first hand =
sufferers so please get this info to them!!

  FORWARD TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW
  EMAIL FROM DC LAWYER CYNTHIA BUTLER

  I am angry and getting emails and recrimination from people wondering =
why KERRY just caved and is not fighting this before the final count in =
Ohio,before any of the fraud was challenged, before New Mexico and Iowa =
even came in.

  There is widespread feeling that he did not lose the election and that =
it
  was taken from him.There is enough here to warrant investigation and =
enough to challenge the results. It's coming from all corners.

  I understand that he has until the official count certification in =
Ohio to
  Un Concede which is several days from now.

  Anyone who thinks that he should unconcede should give reasons why - =
whatever they noticed, particularly in Red Republican Governed States =
using electronic machines- and send them directly to Cameron KERRY, John =
Kerry's brother at his law firm at the address CKerry@Mintz.com

  They should inform us if they were not allowed to vote provisionally =
(for whatever reason- they lost forms, ran out of forms, etc.) I =
personally witnessed a number of things as I reported in Texas with the =
DCCC. (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee)

  If you know anyone in particular in Ohio who tried to vote and was =
turned away at the polls please get their information and notify the =
campaign.

  They should be notified if they experienced lines longer than four
  hours -particularly elderly or infirm people (we call that torture =
when they do it to political prisoners) . They should be notified if =
people were told as has been reported that due to too many people =
showing up in African American precincts, particularly in Ohio where =
there were too few booths (some only had two or three for the entire =
precinct) and told because of heavy turn out they could vote on =
Wednesday. If the n umbers of these sorts of incidents creates a =
percentage margin that exceeds the margin of victory- Un Concession has =
to be made to challenge the count.

  If people wanted to and tried to vote and were prevented or actively
  discouraged from doing so, that is a Civil Rights matter and must be =
dealt with in terms of the ultimate count.

  This is the last email that I am writing on this subject in this =
venue. I am taking it up in other venues.

  Please pass along this to your listservs so that we may make Democracy =
Work in America. We are not a country where he who cheats best wins.

Subject:      gay marriage
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Something I haven't seen articulated enough (though I'm sure it's been said
somewhere) is that if marriage is "redefined" as excluding gays (it's the Right
that's doing the redefining of marriage here) it becomes a moral imperative for
all straight people to either 1) not get married, 2) get married in Canada or
another gay-friendly country, and/or 3) get divorced if they are married now.

If marriage becomes an apartheid-like institution, then straight people like
myself are ethically obliged not to participate in it.

The answer to all of this, I think, is to get the state out of the marriage business
altogether and restrict its legal authority to civil unions for everyone.  As long as
the government can *seem* to have something to do with the "sacred institution"
of marriage, it will be answerable to whatever religious power happens to be in
ascendancy.  The state *does* need to be religion-deaf.

More and more, incidentally, I feel that the left and right have both been
hoodwinked by the mass media.  The right, of course, by right-wing media like
Fox (but also within the "pre-modern" medium of their churches), and the left
simply by their assumption that the mass media are the only media that matter,
thus failing to recognize the existence of pre-modern ones like the churches.

The churches desperately need investigating; the left needs to start visiting
right-wing churches regularly, to see what's being said in there and who exactly
is writing the sermons.

Also, within the evangelical population there's a key constituency or set of
constituencies that could greatly influence the future power of the Christian
Right and where it goes in the future: evangelical youth and evangelical
women.  We need to speak straight to them.

Dear Michael,

Where can I get a taste of David Meltzer's "rant against the romantic
commodification which surrounds the Beat Generation" -- or is it only
for sale?

I can't make it to City Lights, tho that appears to be an unusual venue
for this rant.


Yr slavish admirer, Derek

Beat Thing=20

Unhurried Vision=20
by Michael Rothenberg

Beat Thing is part poetry and part expos=E9, both tribute to the down in
the street wildness and rant against the romantic commodification which
surrounds the Beat Generation. During the late1950s, David Meltzer was
an active poet in the San Francisco North Beach scene often reading with
jazz musicians at various bars and coffeehouses.

Unhurried Vision, a year in the life of Michael Rothenberg, is really a
deeply loving celebration & farewell to mentor Philip Whalen, poet,
roshi, & all around confounder of boundaries. A day-book; a non-epic
odyssey through routes & roots of living & dying; a gastronome's
pleasure dome, but above all a deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of
poetry's centrality in realizing mundane & profound instances in the
everyday extraordinary.

hi.
thanks, conrad, for dragging my name into this. lol
want to clarify that the time i spent in xian (& media) chat rooms i was
actually posting a 'morality test' ( eg - circle preference: 1. a. killing
foreigners or  b. killing embryos) as well as short posts like 'military
action to terrorism is like water to a grease fire'  etc. i wasn't able to
bring myself to dialog the way i fantasize that other, more patient, folks
might be able to in order to appeal to the 'goodness' - if not reason - in
others.

one encouraging thing i did see was the amount of posters who spoke up about
being xians against bush & the republican 'morality.' not a lot but they
were there.

pamela is right on about infiltrating so-called xian groups with 'liberal'
xians, tho i don't like the word 'liberal' so much as, say, 'logical' or
even  'real.' i so wish we could create some super-dynamo
preachers/ministers/clergy who can really give it to their audience. i mean,
define a morality more in line with acts/words of their messiah, rather than
this ironic & absurd 'morality.' i've got a few ideas i'd like to see happen
but i highly doubt i've enough motivation to overcome my intense nausea
being around/among such people to do it myself. beyond guerilla-posting chat
rooms before elections. i'd much rather eradicate religion altogether but
that's unfathomable, isn't it.

catherine daly stated in her post that there is actually a very small
population of active xians. it doesn't seem that way to me. regardless,
there are obviously a large number of voters who feel strongly about their
conventional xian dogma. i'm not sure this speaks of their personal
conviction so much as it does of their identity, which i suspect is at the
heart of a good deal of social crises right now.

with fear & chaos of overpopulation, communication inundation, incessant
advertising, competition ideologies, i think more than anything people are
desperate for  identity representation. as my friend, heather radawski, has
pointed out,  W has successfully sold himself as the desired American
Identity  & no amount of argument or reason will change the minds of those
who also want to be perceived as     a cowboy, i guess - arrogant,
unsinkable, privileged, making law according to his own interest.* really
curious how that's worked - how people prefer to cling to a fantasy identity
when it comes to governance, rather than choosing representation of their
physical/economic reality. counter-productive is an understatement. the
wages of consumerism, selling self-image so much that most operate according
to their desired image.  ?

(* i also wonder if this is possibly the last clinging gesture of The
[desperate] Man b4 he loses age-old Privilege. i often wonder if there's
anything more dangerous.)

you asked pamela what would be key issues & how to make it happen - a more
tolerant atmosphere. a starting place would be to more intelligently argue
points using the same source, by emphasizing what this jesus person did &
said that is obviously more tolerant than current dogma. also to highlight
relevant passages that would help conflicted folks make decisions. for
example (i'm almost embarrassed to know this crap),  mt 12:1-14 would
indicate he chose one 'sin' over another. the greater sin being to fail the
hungry and sick.  etc.

i suspect what would be especially helpful, however, would be to widely
distribute texts of jesus' life/words that are better translations from the
aramaic. also the earlier gnostic texts & current scholarly works of the
history of all these texts. i mean get the churches involved, schedule talks
& announce them to congregations. confront -- no, bombard them with their
own savior. there are certainly lists of churchmembers - i'm sure the GOP
has been utilizing them. wish this would just magically happen. something,
anything.

sighing now.

augh,
hassen

really, would be fun if some high-profile, charismatic evangelist stood up
to tell the self-proclaimed xians that they're misled by false prophets &
golden calves etc!  call bush's image antichrist. preach fire & brimstone to
those who think that defending america against  so-called terrorists takes
moral priority over taking care of the sick & hungry. i can hear the choir,
smell the sulfur. . .

In Fallujeh George Bush & Company have put a new or, perhaps, an old face of
a particular United States on Iraq. It's a sorrowful site/ sight. The
outcomes through out Iraq and beyond are sorrowful. Or, as Bush recently
described the effort in Iraq, "a catastrophic disaster.'

As with the late Presidential election, beyond sorrow, I am not sure what
one can yet do. The quiet, however, seems both ominous and full of
potential.

I suspect signals will soon begin to appear. This will be serious
business.

was this directed to me personally?  what are the genres of poetry - do you
mean the style of ?

Can he hwo likes Mozart and Xenikis like a Punk Rockers as well asjaxx, and
or Country and Western - well I can at differnt times and places.... but
lean toward Bach and Mozart...

More to the point perhaps  - Why do I  - does anyone - like or am I (or
anyone) interested in certain poetry? and - What is poetry ??

If to me (and maybe if not) - I like to keep open on that - I like and or
are interested in a range of styles - from the Modernists on and others.

Actually all genres I would say - keep interested in everything...

Range from Keith Douglas  (obviously ranges further athn that...go back to
the first person wrote a poem) to the Langos - certain NZ poets, certain
Australian (Francis Webb, Martin Johnson) - the European symbolists etc and
some of such writers as Nick Piombino, Ron Silliman (and the poets in 'In
the American Tree' book) and the various NY Schools - [ also -various of the
British poets  of the Grossteste press (havent read enough of them)...have
been reading the Cantos, got diverted into what Pound himself quots (hence
read translated of classics etc last year), the MOdernists - Wiliams Moore
Stevens Bishop etal...keep an open mind - after all in  terms of natural
ability I feel that Keith Douglas is possibly the 20 Cent's greatest poet -
but he died at  ~20 in1945 ...so and he wasnt an "innovator" per se....oh
also Berryman, Ashbery and all his friends... is a favourite etc etc Alan
Sondheim is very interesting although his work baffles me almost completely
he and his work intrigue me!

Well then it went down to 10,700 where it usually meanders. It was up
there for about ten minutes. I was so happy! I couldn't believe my luck! I
am doing everything I can to ensure my survival! I'm suicidal! Miserable!
This was going to push me over the edge. I finally had enough sites! I'd
live for a few months longer. Then I'd off myself... maybe! Just about all
the protection I need! But so vulnerable!

But here's what happened - just a bit later - you can see for yourself!

It took .03 seconds longer! It wondered "what was up"! I've gone back to
the drawing board! I need more affirmation, reassurance, backup. There's
just not enough to go around! I'm on it! I'm in on it! Yes, when 20,000
comes, I think that's it, I'll kill myself! Reinforcements. It will take a
year or so to peter out, after-fuck dribble, cleanup! Right now, it's too
risky! More, more!

Books I like and reasons to read them


- This is one of my columns reviewing recent purchases, trades, arrivals,
found books, bound and unbound books. While I'm writing it, I'm listening
to 'embedded' reporters make their ugly one-sided reports from the troops
in Fallujah. I broke down earlier. Our news is managed like never before,
and for all the talking we do about it here in this space, it continues.
We may be so useless in the world, which is beyond anything but the most
brutal seizures of power, the most brutal tortures and slaughter.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, translated and edited by Garmonsway. This is
the standard old Everyman's Library edition. The Chronicle - like the
Russian Primary Chronicle - should be read widely. It's part and parcel of
anglo-European root. The chronicle is actually a group of chronicles which
go through the Norman Conquest. Required reading for a lot of us.

Spy Planes and Electronic Warfare Aircraft, Bill Gunston, Arco 1883. I
found this recently and love it. It's about seeing instead of killing,
although sight itself is a grasp/rapture/raptor. Although outdated, it has
the Lockheed SR-71 in it, a work of art which I saw in real life in Omaha.
I like to think of these planes monitoring forest fires, clear-cutting,
and other environmental travesties, instead of fast-forward monitoring of
'insurgents.' Almost none of them have weaponry. I dream of the whole
tribe of them watching each other soundlessly in the skies, leaving the
rest of us alone.

PDF Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Sid Steward, O'Reilly.
Personally I am irritated by PDF, finding it clunky, almost useless within
browsers, long-loading, difficult to manipulate and at times even to
download. This book does tell you how to work it more flexibly, from both
creator and consumer viewpoints. I highly recommend this to academics and
anyone (myself included) who has to work with the format.

Operation 'Phantom Fury' continues unabated on the television. 'Coalition
forces are now moving' into Fallujah against those 'who want to stop
democracy.' An obscenity.

The book includes sections on speeding up Acrobat's startup, copying data
from PDF pages, managing a group of PDFs, authoring and self-publishing
PDFs, and, among other things, "dynamic PDF" which is fairly interesting.

For myself, I'd like to see a spy-plane Acrobat that opens instantly, a
browser in which files melt and can be infinitely molded, almost html...

Fundamentalism, The Search for Meaning, Malise Ruthven, Oxford, 2004. This
is an excellent introduction - it's only 200-plus pages - to the issue,
which needs to be examined in great detail. I'm going to order other
works, mainly from the Fundamentalism Project - I'd also like to know more
about the neurophysiological issues involved - Alport's The Nature of
Prejudice years ago mentioned some studies. In any case, this book is
excellent, focusing mainly on Christian, Jewish, and Islamic movements,
discussing their relation to the book and the book's 'inerrancy.' Do check
it out.

A Guide to Nature in Winter, Donald Stokes, Little, Brown, 1976. This is
wonderful and useful for those of us who play amateur mycologist or
ornithologist in the dead of winter, which isn't really dead of course,
just quiet. This is an easy read for the United States; I assume there are
similar guides for Europe and Canada.

All the used books by the way should be on www.abe.com at the least.

The Sexual Life of Catherine M., Catherine Millet, has just appeared in
paperback here, with a 'new afterword.' She edits Art Press, one of the
best art journals in the world (or at least was when I was reading it).
The book has been written about extensively; I'm surprised I've seen so
little reference to it on the lists I'm on. But it's brilliant, intense,
physical/theoretical, producing a new form of writing and liberation that
is more necessary than ever today.

The news is off, so there, Fallujah again buried, I'll change the channel.
I'm trying to work safely but in the midst of slaughter that can't harm
me, it can only exist as if otherwise, but not.

The Culture of Civil War in Kyoto, Mary Elizabeth Berry, California, 1994.
This book was mentioned first by Philip Agre; it's an account of culture,
not just of war, but of ludic tea ceremonies, dances, during the 15th and
16th century 'Era of Warring States' in Kyoto. What fascinates me is the
resonance between civility, civilian unrest, dance-form, control and
release - all those Bataillian qualities (or Foofwa d'Imobilite for
example) played out centuries ago. This work is useful for me in my own
aesthetic founderings; I highly recommend it, even for those not
particularly interested in Japanese history.

Building the Perfect PC, Robert Bruce and Barbara Fritchman Thompson,
O'Reilly, 2004. I've seen a number of books on the subject - this one is
going to be used, this summer - I want to construct a portable PC for
performance, experimentation, and digital microscopy. I think this will be
the most useful book I've seen (certainly the most useful of the O'Reilly
volumes on the subject); the illustrations are in color, incredibly clear,
and the book covers a number of PCs from the ground up. (I'll probably go
for a LAN party PC which can be connected to a laptop, with enough
performance for video projection of several screens at once.)

This surplus technology - for me it's all surplus at this point - is
played out against an ad for a 'chimney sweeping log' that projects
against accidental fireplace fires. They could spread through the house.
They could be the result of a bomb; if we bomb areas that might be booby-
trapped, we've made them safe for our American boys and girls. So few
casualties! Back to the news.

Making the Alphabet Dance, Recreational Wordplay, Ross Eckler, St.
Martin's, 1996. I hadn't seen this child of Oulipo and Scrabble-buzz
before but its lists of words and linguistic processes seems unique to me
- it ranges far afield, and includes mathematical analyses of spanning
trees of letter transformations. The work is simultaneously rooted in the
heuristics of English and the desire for platonic form; in fact, mappings
onto the Platonic solids are explored. There are also examples from other
languages, but the emphasis is on English. I've been reading this with
intense joy - watching the bending of language to fit the form, just as
I might use 'aas' as a word in cheating-Scrabble. Or is it?

Writings on Psychoanalysis, Freud and Lacan, by Althusser, Columbia, 1996.
What can I say? I hadn't seen this work before, I'm fascinated by it, more
on a biographical level, or a level dealing with the discursivity of power
and the power of discursivity, rather than the theoretical 'meat' within
it. I can hear the wheels working. Lacan: 'Our relations are old,
Althusser.' And so they are. Read on about the Law of Order, the Law of
Culture, etc. This is a wonderful book and leads to a book I'm hardly
qualified to review,

Synthetic Philosophy, First Principles, Herbert Spencer, my edition from
Appleton, 1892, although the work is decades earlier. Well, he is
associated with social darwinism, 'survival of the fittest,' and so forth.
This work, which is the first in the series of Synthetic Philosophy, has
been a surprise, since it seems above all to predate chaos and nonequil-
ibrium thermodynamics theories in a fascinating way which also reads like
phenomenology. The titles of some of the chapters will give you the idea -
'The Persistence of Relations Among Forces,' 'The Instability of the
Homogeneous,' 'The Multiplication of Effects,' 'Segregation,'
'Equilibration,' 'Dissolution' - you get the idea. I'm currently working
my way through sections of this.

Steal This File Sharing Book, What They Won't Tell You About File Sharing,
Wallace Wang, No Starch, 2004. I just received this review copy, and hope
to give an analysis later, but just want to say that it is amazing; this
is a subject I know something about from the old IRC days, but not much
more. The book gives reviews of just about everything from cracking
e-books to 'stealing' files, pornography, etc. I think works like this
will become more and more necessary in this country - where I now use an
'rmm' command to wipe my panix.com account clean of suspect files after
the fact. Ah well..

The Daily Show is coming on with Jon Stewart. I will hear more about
Fallujah, I'm sure, with humor. We've got to mute everything, serve it up
clean, bury the rage. It's not NYC that's burning tonight.

I'm reading Stoker's Dracula which is brilliant and an odd Kittler-like
demo of technology inserted into neural discourse networks; at one point
early on, someone snaps a Kodak of what will later be a house of horror.
As with Frankenstein, the novel is far better than what's made out of it;
it reads as texts within texts, ideologies within ideologies. I haven't
got to the Christian part of it yet, which I gather is a disappointment.

Southern California, Moon Handbooks, this one by Kim Weir, 2001. I don't
review travel-books in general, but we're going to Santa Ana - I have a
residency this summer. Even though I've lived in L.A. and Irvine, this
book is somewhat of a wonder. The author's an environmentalist, and it
shows; I'm learning of needed resources.

Has anyone read Plenitude 2.0, Grant McCracken? Periph.: Fluide, 1998.
I'd love to discuss it; it's obscure, odd, wonderful, maverick, reminds me
of The Accursed Share, but far more fun, and please read it and write
about it.

Then there's Brian Wilson's Smile which blew me away, and was nothing like
the reviews or documentary described - if anything they all did a
disservice. This is somewhere between Satie and post-industrial, indie and
Webern but really makes a Gershwin case for an Amerikan music yet unheard
but unlike Gershwin it's original as all getout and does stuff with time
and expectation that turns it brilliant. The docu just got it into trouble
as far as I'm concerned.

More Fallujah, bombings, fire, fury, on the tube.

To recommend: Anything by Gillian Welch, I'm obsessed, it speaks to me in
these dark times. I came late to it, am riding out the wave. A Human Being
Called David Daniels is a simply amazing cdrom, director of art Regina
Celia Pinto, http://arteonline.arq.br, which I've been looking and
re-looking at. Julian Samuel, whose work I value greatly, sent me a cdrom,
Save and Burn, on libraries and politics and phenomenology and... I will
review this as well. You might write him at jjsamuel@vif.com .

'adopting very classic guerilla tactics' - 'you don't stand around and
take it from them' - 'you live to fight another day' - 'not people who
wear uniforms' - 'very very easy for them to go back to their homes, back
to their tribal compounds' - the _phone voice_ speaks, out of nowhere,
image-over, as if we're _there_ and _now_ and it's slaughter all over
again - again? - it hasn't stopped, won't - U.S. dogs - bow-wow-wow

I mentioned ESP-Disk is back in business - go for the Ayler - it's all
brilliant.

another video of a US bombing spree - as usual black-and-white, from a
distance - little white square outline surrounding a 'target' - the other
week saw a whole family in the center of one of these -

Sabotaging Files with Cuckoo Eggs - Killing a Computer - more from Steal
This File Sharing Book -

Far too long, the war's on, trembling, all this discourse seems both
central and out of place. New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics,
Thomas Tymoczko, from 1986, Birkhauser, wonderful collection, articles on
the ideal mathematician, time-dependence of mathematical truth, where's my
old Brillouin book -

Alan, hoping I haven't let you down. Too many people hear talking suicide.

"Writing History"

If everything becomes everything else
       if every event touches every other event
creates it reverberates through and beyond it
       then nothing is inconsequential and history
is both what we are and what we are becoming
       a continuous making and unmaking a story of unspeakable
intimacy and unspeakable loss here is a photograph
       of winter and dusk and train tracks
and a grimy factory woman who is trying to make her way home
       someone who has passed out of one history
into another where the blanks are unfillable
       we know so little but on that
we base everything
        & the photographer who is about to take her photograph
he does not know her
        does not know her reason his own this man who became
the photograph I now hold in my hand how
         the blanks & spaces fill the years
how much the body the tired body
         the photographed body the figurative body
depends upon them
         the spaces that loom larger longer wider
what was it you saw when you glanced up at him
         that man who lived in a world which still thought
the world was all in the things you could see

C. S. Giscombe
from _Giscome Road_

The song's a commotion rising in the current, almost an apparition: or the
shape

rises -- obvious, river-like -- in the blood (in the house that the blood made)

& goes on, is the fact of hte "oldest ancestor," in who

name etc description itself persists on out, not like some story into the
uplands, on into the stony breakdown, no line

between the old river god & the old man's name coming up along the river &
on the road:

an endless invisible present going on, a noise

(with nothing at the other side of it)

. . .

Having wanted to drive out to the edge, right out

to the mutest edge out there,

the mutest edge, the emptiest soundstage,

out to the invisibility there, out

to all that "up" there in Canada that took place up there --

Giscome, B. C. all unincorporated now up

on the Upper Fraser Rd off desolate Rte 16 to Alberta,

off the Alberta-bound road the Yellowhead (for Pierre B---, the blonde
Iroquois who'd arrived

at the mountains there at the Alberta end, the source of the
road):  miscegenation's

the longest nuance, the longest-lasting open secret

(in old B.C., Gov. Douglas was also "a man of colour," "a West Indian

of racially mixed parentage" out at the end of a pier in Victoria, welcoming

"creole," pragmatic

. . .

[Northern Road]

The arrival at the edge of water

some little end of the water come to & breached

(in a stretch forward or as though in a gesture
from, typically, one of so many edges),

a hiatus in the travel by water, the build

of negatives & switchbacks along the same old bank

the edge of a story

the story's same old edge through the new twists, almost

intestinal from all maps of it, knotted --

the edge in the voice, the little edge creeping,

a fast little edge that could have crept into the voices & stayed there

unrelieved 'til the edge was come to of the water itself

(the endless description)

the endlessness of the story breached
at the foot finally

at the root of the trees

Pound was very depressed at the end of his life - oculdnt write - felt he
had failed etc - but the Cantos is a marvellous acheivement - sure he was
obsessed with making political change but that isnt really possible -
especially not in the strange way that Pound thought - he was somewhat
Utopian  and the best of him was great in that respect, and great as a as
lyric poet and a epicist - the worst of him was a fascist and muddled - at
his best there are some marvelously fine writings in the Cantos I love his
traslation and rewriting of Ovid - the transformation of the ship that takes
Dionysius etc
Inside none of us who writes feel (all the time) that what we write is
futile  - any thing can be good if you feel good about it......eating  -
when I am well, is my favourite activity for eg  lol

These poets (including Pound baby) take/took themselves too seriously -
poetry is just another thing I do (it is just a hobby lets face it we are
all hobbyists: even Nick and Charles Bernstein) - like to eat, read, rave
about politics etc (doesnt do much good), play chess, ring people, go for a
walk, feed the cat, talk to the cat, go to the shops, ring my grandson, and
so on.........but its all life: and life is both serious and funny  and
tragic and comic.

    'we, strange beating things'

Richard Taylor


PS  The US politics etc in teh Cantos I find a bit boring but it could be
seen that the "dry' stuff  "chimes" with the corruscations etc Charles
Bernstein's essay "Pounding Fascism" is quite a good summary of Pound - I
know there is a journal Paieduma - I read some one in that once (dipping
into that august magazine - its almost a cult object....)  and he was
anylysing the Cantos  - his conclusion was something like -

"but there is no design, no structure...it doesnt connect up"    !!!

Such a lack of  "connection" could be a writer's strength.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Interesting, in small doses, to follow US progressives trying to figure=20=

out why their nation reelected Bush. =46rom this side of the border=20
(north), it's perhaps too easy to moralize; nevertheless...

Isn't it possible that the problem of why the majority of American=20
voters voted for Bush is not a question of false consciousness,=20
misinformation or the power of propaganda. People are not certainly not=20=

that dumb. I doubt pro-Republicans particularly believe George Bush=20
when he says he is bombing the civilian population of Iraq's major=20
cities because he wants to set them free. Nor do they think he believes=20=

it. Or care. The great majority of Americans, whether Christian,=20
right-wing Christian, or otherwise can read the Presidential wink. They=20=

know he's doing it for oil. But they too want oil. And the cheaper the=20=

better. Those who have some money put away in mutual funds know those=20
savings are likely to increase with military spending and corporate tax=20=

breaks. They are simply prepared to sacrifice non-Americans and poor=20
Americans in the process, especially if they dress in long robes and=20
long beards, or have a different skin colour. They prefer not to say=20
so, naturally. And they appreciate that George Bush and his pals are=20
providing a discourse to package it.

And yet, progressive forces in the US continue to say: "We support the=20=

troops?" True, those troops are, for the most part, recruited in
minority and poor communities, but the soldiers voted overwhelmingly=20
for Bush in the election. Why? Self-deluded? Or because the military=20
offers them a way out of the ghetto, and grinding poverty. All right,=20
this opportunity requires in exchange that they risk their lives and=20
murder others. But they're smart enough to know nothing is free. So be=20=

it.

Shouldn't we be telling them: don't do it. Don't sign up. And if you=20
have signed up, get out, go awol, refuse to fight. Those who continue=20
to go in and fight have to accept the responsibility. I cannot support=20=

them, help them, give them better equipment, or wish them well. Surely,=20=

by now, there are no more "innocent" Americans. My support has to go to=20=

those Americans who take action to resist their government, and to the=20=

enemies of the US, those who resist its invasions. One would have=20
thought the time for clever educational strategies of propaganda, for=20
sweet-talking the masses in new and more palatable discourses was over.=20=

We went through all these discussions during the Viet Nam War. The=20
Vietnamese came to the conclusion that the only convincing argument=20
they could make to the American people was in body bags, in higher and=20=

higher economic costs, and finally in defeat.

And yet, there were still some US progressives who somehow believed it=20=

was the anti-war movement in the US that ended that war. As thought it=20=

had to be Americans themselves who are the agents of change; never the=20=

Other. Speaking of myths, it might be useful to explore again the=20
question of why Americans, even the more critical-minded, still believe=20=

with all due respect, this is a valid question,
especially for the emotionally shattered,
disturbed e.p. who wrote the late cantos. even the
robust, younger pound had conceded that his
society and culture had stopped listening to him
(see hugh selwyn mauberly, and the literary
essays, etc.) indeed half the cantos are taken up
with kvetching about the poet's high place among
princes of antiquity (Malatesta, the Albigensians,
Confucius) and how things ain't what they used to
be. then pound signed on with mussolini, thinking
he would restore that place, and was figuratively
and literally broken by the result.

I think it's fair to say that pound really thought
he had failed in his project
to make a paradiso
> >
terrestre

which is what the cantos are about. he said as
much to allen ginsberg when he visited him in
italy not long before he died. of course allen
tried to convince him he was wrong about that and
for many poets he succeeded brilliantly. but for
others the cantos are no doubt a turgid,
fragmented mess.

robert, what you describe would fall under the category of people who
"don't want to listen"... and the motives for not wanting to listen
are in all likelihood variously self-interested, fearful, stubborn,
ignorant, etc, as you suggest... from strictly an electioneering
standpoint, the democrats and others will be looking for ways to
allay or redirect that self-interestedness, fear, stubbornness,
etc... that is, assuming we can show that bush really was elected
even on these rather self-conscious terms (surely a number of people
voting for bush were consciously choosing him on this basis---but not
all people voted for him on this basis... i'm reminded of that
analysis of the electorate in terms of formal education---the more
educated classes voted for kerry)...

but as i'm trying to suggest, whether or not that election effort
succeeds---and this will turn in part on what the next four years
bring---leftist politics in the u.s. will likely be hampered by a
failure not only of rhetoric, but of conceptualization/belief...
perhaps this constitutes a failure of the social imagination (if you
will)... for long-term change and not simply damage control, i would
think the emergence of left-wing think tanks (etc.) are essential to
altering the social landscape---over time...

also, i wouldn't be so hasty to dismiss the antiwar movement of the
60s... surely that movement took its lead from body counts... so,
people die in a war, and other people who might die (or might have
died) protest people dying... it's an odd sort of logic that claims
that said protest movement did not really end the war---that people
dying ended the war... i mean, what if people died and nobody
protested?... or are you suggesting that there was a silent protest
of sorts that ended the war? (and to claim thus would require that we
get into details that this list and my fingers probably can't support
at the moment)... that the right has been right along decrying the
protest movements of the sixties, and that some on the right claim
that the war would have been WON w/o same, makes me doubly suspicious
of what you're saying...

as to whether this nation and its checkered past is a "great
liberating experiment in popular democracy," as you put it:  well,
the chomsky's of the world will never cede this sort of ground, and
will (i daresay) never on this basis get elected (i'm a big fan of
chomsky's, btw, albeit i didn't like his response to 9/11)... in fact
chomsky is fond of saying that no one ought to be proud of their
government...

in some sense one's outlook on such matters depends on whether one
expects governments to be entirely humane entities... it didn't take
me too long to figure out that the usa had a [cough] checkered past,
for instance (and continues to be in denial about same, in many
ways)... so i have mixed feelings about this, in that, on the one
hand, this nation has often acted as a nation in utterly barbaric
ways... yet, on the other, i wouldn't live anyplace else (even
today---though i could sure stand a six-month break from the 48 just
about now)... kinda like when i visit the Big City (chicago, nyc,
what have you), which, for all of its wonders, can on a bad day feel
an awful lot like a bad dream when you consider the racial-economic
disparities that plague such massive concrete pours... but if you
walk into the Big City knowing this to be the case, you may be more
prepared to appreciate its offerings (while in the back of your mind
you just KNOW there are people who are having a really, really bad
day)...

best,

joe

Subject:      MLA/Philadelphia: Bush, hotels, readings and other miracles
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi, everyone.

I heard that Bush might make an appearance at the MLA
convention this year.  He has been working on
_ostranenie_ for the last four years and has reached
an understanding of the concept of defamiliarization
which he will present in a paper titled "We'll be a
great country where the fabrics are made up of groups
and loving centers."  So, I'm going!

I had already planned to go as I am on the job market,
and I will take my teenage daughter with me (the
convention happens to be scheduled during a most
unconvenient time for single parents--or any parents
for that matter).  Anyhow, may I ask if anyone could
recommend a hotel or a bed and breakfast close to the
Pensylvannia Convention Center, either one from the
list provided by the MLA or another one in that area.
I am operating on a limited budget, so there, you know
it!

Are any readings outside of the convention
planned(like the poetry reading in San Diego, last
year)?  After all, Bush said, "If I'm the president,
we're going to have emergency room care, we're going
to have gag orders," so I'm a bit concerned.

Merci,  Brigitte

I see an inherent problem with this course of action, joe. Candidly
stated: defining what is "good" for everybody seems to be an absurd
exercise.

The act of voting is a numbers game tasked with defining what is 'good'
-- a *might-makes-right* philosophy which equates quantity with quality.
I have given ample demonstration, I hope, of the aggression it supports
and maintains. (Also, as an aside: if you live by the vote, you die by
the vote -- therefore nobody should be complaining about an outcome they
themselves have fully endorsed and orchestrated.)

In short, as soon as one 'buys' into "the basis of something greater
than oneself" they are giving their authority away. The act of
identifying with the external ensures no one ends up with any principles
of their own. (ie. The news becomes nothing but verbatim from company
press releases.)

So, I humbly suggest tuning into a more capable method: turning on to
oneself, and dropping-out of the categorical/hierarchical mindset. The
latter is nothing but a flag-waving attempt to equate true happiness and
blessedness with the pride of enjoying something to the exclusion of
others (ie. I'm a Republican; I'm a Language Poet).

Let's see a return to the category of the person! (ie. a song of
'myself') which celebrates enjoyment of what agrees with one's nature --
not the malicious joy of celebrating benefits gained from a particular
exclusion.

         "Nature without check...The atmosphere is not a perfume "


..|  i mean, what if people died and nobody
..|  protested?...

Imagine all the people Not dying and Not protesting! Why do so many
insist on perpetuating war and aggression?


        "Can't find anyone who's willing to be last..."
        "Can't find anyone who doesn't want to police the wind!"
        "A world of conscious mercy, a world we could create
         if we all sat down and decided not to be great!"

Found Poem: The Post 11-2 South

We should have let them go when they wanted to leave.
But no --
We had to kill half a million people so they'd stay,
like people who=92ll fight for the right to keep slaves
sound like real moral folks.

And, of course, what do we get? Name-calling:
we're called the arrogant northeast liberal elite.
But how about this for arrogant:
the South is the Real America.
the Authentic America.
Really? We founded this country, pal.
Those Founding  Fathers you keep going on
and on about? Who do you think those wig-wearing
lacy-shirt sporting revolutionaries were?
They were blue-staters, pal.
Boston? Philadelphia? New York?  Hello?
Think there might be a reason all the monuments
are up here?

No, no. Just get out. We're not letting you visit
the Liberty Bell and Plymouth Rock any more
until you get over your "Real American" selves
and start respecting those other nine amendments.
Who do you think those stripes on the flag are for?
Nine are for blue states -- and it would be ten
if those early Vermonters had gotten their
Subarus together and broken off from New York
a little sooner.

Get it?
Don't get all uppity about how real you are,
you "Oooooh I've been a state for  almost a hundred years"
Johnny-come-latelies.

All those Federal taxes you love to hate?
They come from us and go to you.
You enjoy your Tennessee Valley Authority electricity
and your fancy bridges and highways that we paid for.
And the next time they need repaired,
Or the next time Florida gets hit by a hurricane,
you can come crying to us if you want to,
but don=92t expect any more money:
you're the ones who built
on an outlying province of a swamp --
not that I think there=92s any province
that can out-lie Florida.

Who=92re the ones who say
"It's your money, not the government's money"?
Nine of the ten states that get the most federal dollars
and pay the least... can you guess?  Go on, guess.
That's right, pal, they're red states.
And  eight of the ten states that receive the least
and pay the most? Too easy, pal -- they're blue states.
It's not your money, it's our money.
What was that Real American Value
you were spouting a minute ago? Self reliance?
Try this for self reliance: buy your own stop signs, pal.

Now that we=92re on the subject,
let's talk about those values for a minute.
Which state do you think has the lowest divorce rate
In the nation? Well? Can you guess?
It's Massachusetts, the center of the gay marriage universe.
Think that's just some aberration?
How about this: 9 of the 10 lowest divorce rates
are blue states, pal, and most are in the Northeast
And where are the highest divorce rates? Care to guess?
Ten of the top ten are those we're-so-moral Red states.
And while Nevada is the worst,
the Bible Belt is doing its full part.
But in spite of that, you think two guys making out
is going to ruin marriage for you? Yeah?
Seems like you're ruining it pretty well on your own
Ever think of that, pal? No,
you're too busy erecting giant stone tablets
of the Ten Commandments in buildings paid for
by the Northeast Liberal Elite.
And who has the highest murder rates in the nation?
It=92s not us up here in the North, pal.

Well this gravy train is over.
Take your liberal-bashing,
confederate-flag-waving,
holier-than-thou,
federal-tax-leaching,
hypocritical bullshit
and stew in it until the next hurricane
or tornado blows it up in your faces again.
.
We=92ll be using the money we don=92t send you to fix it
to build our hospitals and our schools.
Y=92all pray, now, heah?

DH,
Thank you for concurring. I also think that rebellion such as it is will
always fail. Each generation has somewhere a voice for peace and rebellion, but
the greater rebellion goes beyond politics and religion. It's philosophical as
Camus so aptly writes. Continuing to dignify humanity, while admirable and
worthy as occupation and way of life, it still won't change anything. All we can
do is push back harder against the prevailing winds of stupidity. It's very
naive to think we will change the fundamental problems of human nature with any
significant numbers. Living existentially and situationally is the best we can
do. Poets are poets because they want to express themselves in a particular
format. It's futile only in the sense that it won't change the world, but it may
enrich someone's life as art often does. On the other hand, so can a warm
meal, shelter from the cold, a smile, or cold hard cash. What thou lovest well
must remain to tear down, I say, tear down and not become the diffident. Poetry
can make wonderful connections, however temporary.
Mary Jo

with all due respect, this is a valid question,
especially for the emotionally shattered,
disturbed e.p. who wrote the late cantos. even the
robust, younger pound had conceded that his
society and culture had stopped listening to him
(see hugh selwyn mauberly, and the literary
essays, etc.) indeed half the cantos are taken up
with kvetching about the poet's high place among
princes of antiquity (Malatesta, the Albigensians,
Confucius) and how things ain't what they used to
be. then pound signed on with mussolini, thinking
he would restore that place, and was figuratively
and literally broken by the result.

I think it's fair to say that pound really thought
he had failed in his project
to make a paradiso
> >
terrestre

which is what the cantos are about. he said as
much to allen ginsberg when he visited him in
italy not long before he died. of course allen
tried to convince him he was wrong about that and
for many poets he succeeded brilliantly. but for
others the cantos are no doubt a turgid,
fragmented mess.

With all this talk about "moral values" that's going around, I'm interested
in how the notion of moralism can also subconsciously infect aesthetics and
issues of social justice, in conversations among those of us in the blue
states and in general. So, here's one direction in which to take that: what
are some of your "guilty pleasures" in contemporary poetry? Things that you
like, but feel maybe a little embarassed to like?

What kind of moralistic aesthetic limits do you place on your own reading
and do you ever find yourself wanting to rebel from these limits or subvert
them?

This is a cleaned up version of the rant found at

http://fuckthesouth.com/

Did that link get forwarded to the poeticslist? I
can't recall.

Personally, I like the rant version a bit more.

with the online version:

 No, No. Get the fuck out. We're not letting you visit
the Liberty Bell and fucking Plymouth Rock anymore
until you get over your real American selves and start
respecting those other nine amendments. Who do you
think those fucking stripes on the flag are for? Nine
are for fucking blue states. And it would be 10 if
those Vermonters had gotten their fucking Subarus
together and broken off from New York a little
earlier. Get it?

With all due respect, I find this too easy...the notion of poet vs. society
has been around as long as the poete maudit (or even Ovid's "olive-silvery
Sirmio"), and what I am actually asking is stated in terms WITHIN the social
comunity of poets...

What is something unfashionable you like, that you wouldn't be caught dead
(by other poets) reading? Are we all aesthetic monks? Perhaps just a
perverse thought, but I would be interested to hear...

Best,

Tim

This poem and its source text concern me. I think it's an ethical imperative
to avoid generalizing across groups. Take a look at the following stats:

Idaho (68%bush-30%kerry), Indiana (60%bush-39%kerry), Kansas (62%bush-
36%kerry), Montana (59%bush-38%kerry) Nebraska (66%bush-32%kerry) North
Dakota, (62%bush-35%kerry) South Dakota (60%bush-38%kerry), Utah (71%bush-
26%kerry), Wyoming (69%bush-29%kerry)

http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/
nationalelectionresultsbystate.aspx?oi=P&rti=G&cn=1&tf=l

Tennesse, one of the states specifically mentioned in the poem, has a
breakdown of (56%bush-42%kerry). Tennessee, as you can see, leaned more toward
Kerry than any of the non-southern states listed above. Same with Georgia (58-
41), Louisiana (56-42), North Carolina (56-43), & South Carolina (58-40). None
of the many non-southern states with an overwhelming vote for Bush, nor Utah,
which has the greatest percentage of votes for Bush, was mentioned in the poem
or its source text. In addition, before bringing out the ol' civil-war saw and
as-always dangerous stereotypes, I think one would need to look at the
demographics behind the votes carefully to ascertain whether the Bush votes
truly come from the Bubba contingent.

Lying in your ashes, shedding:
a lyre in shallows, and awash
with trenches that succor
only these frozen teats; I'm

glad of your company tonight,
aching, and happy I can
slash and burn my route through
each and every rancid dream
of your cleft brow. I've never been
gladder than when the saddest eyes
I've ever seen were lonely, and

one luscious second they were
on me. Pills and cannabis
bleach like woolen suns,
spitting out awful fullness, fucking
in tune with nothing at all save
the commonality of my absence.
It's a law here that heats the windows
into the little hearts I'm all
outside of. This is good shit, like

silk licking your lungs, like a skinny
hispanic girl who walks in one
night when you're alone, the one

with the eyes pulling something
else along. She's more than
standing there. I do this for
the good of my legs, which ache
one day, and wish.

derek, you may well be right, if i understand aright your concern for
the "person"... my concern is that more individuated fictions are at
least as dangerous to the commonweal as is the cultivation of a
social imagination that struggles with the question of the collective
good... i still hold to the notion that a federal government has to
be, well, federal---has to work in the face of vastly competing
interests to do "what's best"... entirely fraught perhaps, but there
it is... so *something* has to prompt voters into understanding that
this is what a federal govt does, however imperfect... which is to
say, we need change from below and from above (the latter on the
basis of change from below, sure, but not solely so)... and this need
have nothing to do with marching in the streets, though i applaud
those who express their convictions in such terms (providing, that
is, i can applaud the convictions themselves!)...

but you may well be right, to the extent that this "person" you refer
to is a construct that comes intact with an awareness and regard for
the other... i would say that this begins to sound an awful like like
one or another eastern religion, and while i'm not there person-ally,
i would certainly not deny the legitimacy of that perspective...

best,

being from the South, I want to remind everyone that John Edwards, from
NC, was on the Democratic ticket, and was brought on not solely for
balance, but because it was his presence and rhetoric that appealed to red
state voters.

in general, i wish people would disaggregate both the USC and KJL.  not a
few people have come up with a map showing that we are purple rather than
red and blue.  Florida, for inst., can hardly be called purely red or
purely blue, having been on the edge now in two elections.  New Hampshire
switched sides.  and my native state, NC, went solidly for a Democratic
governor, and nearly elected a Democratic senator.  on the other hand,
just across the water from here in Seattle, there are successful pols.
whose basis in faith is probably as strong as Dubya (the exurbs that our
mr. brooks likes to go on about in the NY Times).  the real problem is
that we seem to have red and blue neighborhoods, localities and counties,
not red and blue states.

there is another irony, here, besides the triumph of so-called morality
issues.  church-going and rural voters voted for further public
asset-stripping and further impoverishment of the commons also on the
basis of fear of terrorism, which frankly is not something that folks in
Wyoming et. al. need to worry about.  it's predominantly a blue state
issue, since we are on the borders of the us and because the significant
symbols of the US are in blue states.  i suppose St. Louis' Arch may be a
target, but folks in red states should get real and stop worrying about
their churches and schools.  a fierce Democratic party would start pulling
down the curtain about the actual threat we face, and where we face it.
the heartland may be where our "values" are, but the rest of world,
including the terrorists, sees it as flyover country.

UNDER ALBANY
Ron Silliman
1844710513
216 x 140   116pp
GBP8.99   USD14.99

"With startling frankness, Under Albany lifts each =B3new sentence=B2 of
Silliman=B9s Albany to show us what's underneath. The resulting paragraphs ar=
e
glimpses not only into Silliman's history, but into that of our times. Each
is a sensitive seismograph recording shocks of social struggle."
-- Rae Armantrout

"Under Albany is the shadow movement of Ron Silliman=B9s epic of everyday
life, The Alphabet. Silliman provides a set of extended, vividly etched,
mostly autobiographical, meditations on the background for each of the
original 100 sentences of his 1981 poem Albany. This constructivist memoir
provides an exquisitely rich exploration of the relation of context to
reference, subtext to meaning, back story to presented experience, and
composition to poetics. All of Silliman=B9s work unravels and reforms in this
exemplary and exhilarating act of attention, recollection, and reflection."
-- Charles Bernstein




THE WAYWARD
Alan Sondheim
1844710475
216 x 140mm   252pp
GBP12.99   USD19.99

"Sondheim=B9s work lives on the page, network, screen, and in live
performance. He inhabits all-too-real imaginary spaces where code and flesh
both taunt and attract each other. We are fortunate to be led, cyborg and
prosthetic, by Alan=B9s unparalleled skill and sensitivity."
-- Stephanie Strickland

"Sondheim=B9s diasporic spin sends language whirling in cyberspace and on the
page: his imagination puts us all in a verbal cosmos of exquisite touch and
intellect, meta-commentary (midrash) and wor(l)d-healing.  Welcome to his
world wide web mind."
-- Maria Damon

I dont agree - Pond very fragmentaion was a methodology - a valid one -sure
his"a paradiso"  wasnt attained but many many other poets would say the same
(depending on teir mood at the time of considering their work) - "failed"
maybe on his own terms but Ginsberg was right - overall Pounds poetry and
his work was a success...see my short post on this...we know many
poets/artist who searched for the paradiso but of course it was this very
search/struggle that matters - not even thepolitics of the poet. The art
is(almost all).

See also my short post on this.

If Pound failed then we are all doomed to "failure".  How cana poet "fail"?

From: KJ Barrett <nineeleventruthsquad@yahoo.com>
Date: November 11, 2004 5:51:51 AM EET
Subject: CNN covers 9/11 truth; vote in CNN poll now!

Action alert! You can vote in the CNN poll, "Is there
a US government coverup surrounding 9/11?" So far 80%
say yes, 20% say no. Go to:

http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/


Forwarded from septembereleventh.org
Dear 9/11 truth activists and concerned citizens,

CNN earlier tonight aired an hour segment on the Jimmy
Walter 9/11 Truth
ads in New York, for which they also interviewed Kyle
Hence of 9/11
CitizensWatch and board member of 911Truth.org. A
message from Kyle is below.
From Kyle Hence:

ALERT: CitizensWatch Co-founder Interviewed for
AndersonCooper 360

I was interviewed by Deborah Feyerick of CNN today.
We did about  a 20
minute interview.   My guess is that they will take
the weakest of  sound
bites and continue relegating the call for an
investigation to the
"wacky", "irresponsible" fringes of public discourse.
This approach is  a
grave disservice to the American people and especially
to the victims  and
their families.  70% of the Family Steering
Committee's own  questions
remain unaddressed, having been ignored by the 9/11
Commission.  This is
a travesty especially given the rush to reform the
intelligence agencies
with so many loose ends and such a dark cloud  hanging
over the
government, and the well documented case for cover-up.

The feature on the call to investigate, etc and
perhaps a bit of the
interview with me will be aired tonight sometime
between 7PM and 8PM.

If you elect to contact Anderson Cooper...

http://www.cnn.com/feedback/forms/form5.html?10

..in response to his story on the call to re-open the
investigation I'd
like to encourage folks to  refer to our Spitzer
Complaint at
http://www.justicefor911.org and specifically to bring
attention to the
fact there is a pending investigation of the  collapse
of building #7 (the
first by FEMA having virtually dismissed fire as the
cause of the
collapse), the strong body of evidence compiled by
Michael Ruppert in
Crossing the Rubicon that suggests complicity (ie.
facilitation) through
the 'coincidental' occurrence of multiple war games
under way the morning
of September 11th that led to a frozen air defense and
the major
discrepencies between Richard Clarke's account of the
actions of Myers and
Rumsfeld and the findings of the Commission and  their
own public
statements.

These are three issues amongst many in a complex body
of investigative
leads.  In this short email I can't possibly do them
all justice but I
wanted to be sure your voice is heard at a time when
someone at CNN and
viewers of CNN might be listening.

Thanks for your support.  Be part of a rising tide of
interest and
passion for finally getting to the bottom of 9/11.
Please forward this
along to your lists and reach out however you are
inspired.

Kyle F. Hence
9/11 CitizensWatch -- http://www.911citizenswatch.org
Steering Committee member of Citizens' Complaint and
Petition to
Attorney General of the State of New York for an
Independent Grand Jury
Investigation. [see

> Quirky, quizzical, inquisitive, Ravi Shankar in Instrumentality goes =
in quest of what the oddness of language and imagination can reveal: > =

>=20
> A New Confessions of Zeno, this time in verse. Topics most of us brood =
over in private are here brought out into daylight by an analyst clad in =
bullet-proof unembarrassment.  Ravi Shankar is a comic tragedian of =

perception, mutability, and language. Wild swoops made on the rheostat =

of this poet> '> s analogue for the metamorphic nature of what is past, =
or passing, or to come.
>       -Alfred Corn=20
>=20
> Ravi Shankar's poems are immortal in the flesh, finding in the life of =
the mind--its interpretations, its "instrumentality"--the surpassing, =
transient lyrical moment; and in the life of the world's body the =
permanent, unflinching presence of thought, unconfined by time or space. =
They are the verbal artifacts of a singular, many-sided, and =
distinguished consciousness.
>       -Vijay Seshadri=20

> This is a very special first book. Ravi Shankar's poems have a fine =

abstraction they reveal a metaphysics of longing, binding us to the =
elements of our moving world.
>       -Meena Alexander
>=20
> Here are poems I> '> ve not seen before.  A fog lifts and Ravi Shankar =
gives the reader a landscape of language filled with sharp, stainless, =
geometric forms. There is considerable distance to travel from page to =
page. Even in a poem like > "> Home Together> ">  Shankar detects a =
vacuum in love. From a men> '> s room to a San Francisco sunrise, =
Shankar emerges with a pocketful of koans reflecting the wisdom hidden =
in the stars.=20
>       - E. Ethelbert Miller
>=20
> Lovers of poetry will find in Ravi Shankar's INSTRUMENTALITY the lucky =
serendipity one hopes for in a new poet: an original voice. The poems =
take their origin as does all fine poetry, in a love of language and a =
metaphorical vision combined with the imperative of music.  Below > the =
shimmering surface, however, currents of Indian spirituality and western =
philosophy draw the reader deeper into the works - a serious dialectic =
playing out in the soul of a sensitive young man pondering life's =
mysteries, large and small. The old questions take on a freshness and =
interest when seen through the new eyes of a poet of such complexity. =
Other times, the work is more playful. Like Wallace Stevens or the =
metaphysical poets, his conceits sing with intelligence, wit, and the =
intricacies of extended metaphor. Coming away from the work, one thinks =
of the jewel-encrusted coat of a raja or a wizard - a pun comes to mind: =
Ravishing. In a long poem celebrating the launching of the space shuttle =
Discovery, th poet says, "I feel as though a part of us has lifted off." =
And so it is for the reader of this fine collection of poems.=20
>       -Richard Harteis=20

> In the stunning title poem of Instrumentality, Shankar writes of > "> =
action> '> s unstuttering arc which is eloquence and muteness at once.> =
">  That idea expresses what I find in this collection, for here poems =
becomes performatives that enacts their totality in the tension between =
graceful expression and silence.  Shankar is a deeply philosophical poet =
who explores the major questions while attuned to the flux that is the =

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

Due to avoidable circumstances, the 4th Bob Cobbing Celebration Reading by=

Maggie O'Sullivan and Jennifer Cobbing scheduled for 6th December 2004 HAS=

BEEN CANCELLED=2E

The SVP readings at CPT for 17 Jan and 28 Feb remain on schedule

The cancellation may adversely affect the possibility of continued use of
CPT for poetry - please support the January events

I apologise to everyone who was looking forward to this event=2E Yes, it i=
s
the second cancellation of this event=2E The first was absolutely
unavoidable=2E The second=85

Inevitably, I shall be asked why; and it gets awkward=2E But I do not want=
 to
be thought to be at fault=2E

(A summary of the reasons for the cancellation is given below=2E It is as
accurate as possible=2E Names are covered by labels=2E)



THE REASON

22nd June 2004

SVP announced the new date (6th December) for 4th Bob Cobbing Celebration =
-
a set of performances by Maggie O'Sullivan and Jennifer Pike Cobbing, to
replace the June date which had been cancelled due to the fatal illness of=

Maggie O'Sullivan's father



July 2004

Another organiser undertakes to organise a reading by a Famous Poet on 6th=

December 2004=2E He does not tell SVP=2E [This info learned 8 November 04]=




August - October

Bob Cobbing's 4th Celebration repeatedly announced at readings and on list=
s





Tues 7th November

SVP confirms broad travel / hotel arrangements with Maggie O'Sullivan



Wednesday 8th November

SVP confirms details with Jennifer Cobbing



Wednesday 8th November, evening

The Other Organiser writes to SVP of "an unfortunate clash that has arisen=
,
and I wanted to do this before advertising anything further=2E [=85]

I should have made you aware of the clash but being very busy with too muc=
h
else, unfortunately I didn't=2E I also accept that letting you know about =
it
sooner than this may have been a good idea, but having said that, I'm not
sure it would have actually changed anything - the 6th is the only date I
can do anything on, and having already re-arranged the Cobbing tribute, my=

thinking has been that you wouldn't have wanted to change it again=2E"



SVP writes back

Protests at not being told and that the Other Organiser is prepared to "go=

ahead regardless, because I know that people will go to what you are
organising"

Says apart from anything else a large gate is needed to cover costs and
asks Can you cover that please?

Notes also "damage that will be done to Chris Goode's argument for CPT
continuing as a poetry venue"



CPT informed of problem



Other organiser responds

he will pay some money, quite a bit, towards costs if SVP goes ahead but
also suggests movement to another day - his cannot be moved

He has, without authority, already rung the hotel he imagines is involved
and the rail company to negotiate cancellation=2E Offers money for this
option " in recognition of that inconvenience=2E" but less than for the ot=
her
+ a public apology on this option only

NB He has already tried to put this proposal directly to Maggie, leaving a=

message for *her to ring *him

The message does not mention Jennifer



SVP replies

SVP reading isn't moveable & suggests *he cancels

SVP says this is an important reading in itself, a reading by one of the
finest poets around and a performance 40 years on of Cobbing's ABC in Soun=
d=2E

"It is also part of the planned series of Cobbing celebrations, unavoidabl=
y
cancelled once; and we all owe Bob; and have, I believe, an imperative upo=
n
us to remember him for what he did for us=2E It is important too to Jennif=
er
who has suffered one cancellation already and has invested a lot
emotionally in this: to her, of course, this is far more than another
reading=2E

Finally, it is important as *the way of showing the new CPT director the
viability of poetry at CPT", given the likely undivided audience

"if you go ahead with your reading, it would be prudent to cancel, and tha=
t

Fearful and stubborn, I think, fall under self-interest. I mean US
people stubbornly don't care how they harm others if they can maintain
or improve their standard of living. That's the American way. Ignorance
is not a motive. Anyway, I precisely don't believe ignorance explains
why people voted for Bush. They knew very well what he intends to do.
Probably the Democrats will end up deciding (as usual) they can win
people's votes by playing more successfully to their fears and
self-interest, rather than challenging them on the fundamental issues,
the wrongness of the war in Iraq, for example, or the need to make real
sacrifices to stop global warming, etc. If so, they may very well get
elected again down the line. But then they will simply continue the
same fundamental policies as the Republicans, minus some of the
rhetoric. Which won't help the rest of the world.

Well, I don't know about tanks, but some hard thinking would be good,
yes.

I guess I meant that here again, the US population as a whole was not
moved by the critique of the justice or lack of justice of the war.
They shifted against it because it became too costly in money and
American lives, and they were losing. I mean they were concerned about
US bodies, not Vietanmese. Anyway, in the end, the Viet Cong won that
war, not the US left, who were unwilling or slow to support the Viet
Cong directly or to sabotage their own country's war effort, and
generally too meek in their opposition, all the while reasoning the
same way the Democrats are now, that they had to find a way to convince
the majority without challenging their self-interested willingness to
murder others.

I think the right argues that the US could have won the war if they had
gone all out: more money, more bombs, more firepower. But Kerry also
promised to send in necessary force. That lesson has already been
applied in Gulf War, and now in Iraq. In Fallujah, for example, they
have bombed the city and its inhabitants into dust before going in with
American bodies.

I see what you mean. But, on the other hand, isn't this exactly what
Bin Laden is saying about Americans? That the best strategy to get them
to lay off is to take the danger and unpleasantness of living
elsewhere, in large part caused by the US back to them.

How about a judo-like movement. Why not call on the US government to
surrender to Bin Laden. Let him have the headaches of administering
victory.

All the best,

Robert

Saskatoon police near 'mutiny' over Stonechild report


Security Apparatus SASKATOON - Faced with what some fear could become a mutiny in the ranks, the police chief in Saskatoon has once again put off a decision on firing two officers involved in the death of Neil Stonechild.

Saskatoon police near 'mutiny' over Stonechild report

SASKATOON   - Faced with what some fear could become a mutiny in the ranks, the police chief in Saskatoon has once again put off a decision on firing two officers involved in the death of Neil Stonechild.

Russell Sabo was to make an announcement on Wednesday about the fates of constables Bradley Senger and Lawrence Hartwig. The announcement has now been postponed indefinitely.

The officers had 17-year-old Stonechild in their custody on the night he disappeared in Nov. 1990, an inquiry concluded last month. His frozen body was found days later on the outskirts of Saskatoon.

Senger and Hartwig have been suspended with pay since Justice David Wright's final report from the inquiry was released.

The report was a scathing indictment of the Saskatoon police force's original investigation into the death.

But rank and file police officers in the city reject any wrongdoing by Senger or Hartwig, or by other police officers involved in the investigation.

Earlier this month, 200 officers voted to support the suspended constables. They demonstrated outside police headquarters while Sabo met with the officers and their lawyers.

Police union president Stan Goertzen said the officers have not been convicted of anything in a court of law, yet they are being portrayed as guilty, and threatened with the loss of their jobs.

Union leaders have made veiled threats of some sorts of "action" if the two officers are fired.

"In essence, the police chief has a mutiny on his hands," said Colin Boyd, an ethics professor at the University of Saskatchewan.

"They're violating their oath of loyalty," said Boyd. "And their oath of loyalty means that they'll subordinate their personal interests for the common good."

Saskatchewan Justice Minister Frank Quennell said Saskatoon police need to act quickly, but he rejects calls to disband the police force.

"I think some of the discussion made by some commentators about substituting a different police force is premature," said Quennell.

The following "Letter To The Red States" comes from my
local Democracy for America forum.  It is written by
"one of us," obviously.  It is not intended for "us,"=20
of course, as we already agree with the sentiments.

I want to ask a few questions about the letter's=20
potential efficacy and try to get at any ways to
improve that efficacy or conclusions=20
suggesting that entirely
other tacts and procedures must be invented

in order to "bring the Red State Repubs" up to=20
snuff or in line with this Blue State position,=20
as it were.

Again, "we" already sympathize with this woman's=20
sentiments and her political persuasion(s).

The letter uses many rhetorical questions that=20
directly question the Red State Repubs'=20
hypocrisy.  Other than that, the letter does
not much SHOUT, RiDIcuLe, PATronize,
Satirize, if at all, and is neither, to our=20
sensibilities, loud nor offensive.

Still, can it get inside their heads and change
their minds? =20

Would they read it, take any of it to heart,=20
be able to access it (or letters/ideas similar)
in any kind of mass media way?

Obviously, why would they reject it, if they
would?

Then, if we cannot conclude other than=20
that they WOULD REJECT IT, what=20
else might work?

Must we, for example, use the same=20
kinds of "manipulation" that have
inclined them to reject such obviously
rational, honest, thoughtful
sentiments?  Must we, say,
"surround them with" media "information"
and "sources" that make them
believe, perhaps incrementally, their
own "authorities" are already adopting
this kind or position and moving
back to what all of us already agree
is sanity?  Oh, I'm talking about, say,
"fake web sites" that show "large=20
groups of other Christians" moving=20
away from Bush/Cheney Co.

I've run out of steam for the moment=20
and I may not have gotten to all of
the questions regarding this good=20
letter -- ooops, okay, I know something
else I want to ask to start determining
if it, and its approach, can be efficacious:

This letter finds very ready "mirrors" in=20
all of "us."  If the Red State Repubs have
not that mirror within them, or a mirror
that distorts what we project, how do=20
help them adopt our mirror, or how do we
work effectively with the distorting mirror=20
they may not be able to replace.  (Also,
precisely what ARE we projecting, if
we are meeting with mirrors that=20
so stubbornly reject us -- perhaps=20
we are creating those very mirrors
in the first place...)

I'm sure that there are many more questions
that can be asked, perhaps some that blow
this frame out of the water and lead to=20
more generative questions.  Anyone?=20

P.S. Anyone who has ever worked with,
say, developmentally disabled children,=20
probably knows that their behavior=20
problems cannot so easily be changed
by direct, rational appeals or directives,
nor by "negativity" towards their "acting
out."  The Red States Repubs present
us with similar behavioral dysfunction...

P.S. All our work deconstructing "what's=20
wrong with their thinking," including the
fabulous work that Lakoff and others=20
have done over the years, does NOT=20
necessarily lead to solutions for adapting
to the problem and finding solutions that
will reduce its awful effects.

A Letter To The Red States

Sorry, I try not to deluge people with my ramblings. But I had to write=20
this and, having written it, had to send it. Even though I don't know=20
anyone I can send it to (without alienating my Republican in-laws, who=20
are the only "middle country" people I know), I am writing this letter=20
to the people in the red states in the middle of the country -- the=20
people who voted for George W. Bush. I am writing this letter because I=20
don't think we know each other.

So I'll make an introduction. I am a New Yorker who voted for John=20
Kerry. I used to live in California, and if I still lived there, I would =

vote for Kerry. I used to live in Washington, DC, and if I still lived=20
there, I would vote for Kerry. Kerry won in all three of those regions.

Maybe you want to know more about me. Or maybe not; maybe you think=20
you know me already. You think I am some anti-American anarchist=20
because I dislike George W. Bush. You think that I am immoral and=20
anti-family, because I support women's reproductive freedom and gay=20
rights. You think that I am dangerous, and even evil, because I do not=20
abide by your religious beliefs. Maybe you are content to think that, to =

write me off as a "liberal" -- the dreaded "L" word -- and rejoice that=20
your candidate has triumphed over evil, immoral, anti-American,=20
anti-family people like me. But maybe you are still curious. So here=20
goes: this is who I am.

I am a New Yorker. I was here, in my apartment downtown, on September=20
11th. I watched the Towers burn from the roof of my building. I went=20
inside so that I couldn't see them when they fell.

I had friends who were inside. I have a friend who still has nightmares=20
about watching people jump and fall from the Towers. He will never be=20
the same. How many people like him do you know? People that can't sit in =

a restaurant without plotting an escape route, in case it blows up?

I am a worker. I work across the street from the Citigroup Center, which =

the government told us is a target of terrorism. Later, we found out=20
they were relaying very old information, but it was already too late.=20
They had given me bad dreams again. The subway stop near my office was=20
crowded with bomb-sniffing dogs, policemen in heavy protective gear,=20
soldiers. Now, every time I enter or exit my office, all of my=20
possessions are X-rayed to make sure I don't have have any weapons. How=20
often are you stopped by a soldier with a bomb-sniffing dog outside your =

office?

I am a neighbor. I have a neighbor who is a 9/11 widow. She has two=20
children. My husband does odd jobs for her now, like building=20
bookshelves. Things her husband should do. He uses her husband's tools,=20
and the two little girls tell him, "Those are our daddy's tools." How=20
many 9/11 widows and orphans do you know? How often do you fill in for=20
their dead loved ones?

I am a taxpayer. I worked my butt off to get where I did, and so did my=20
parents. My parents saved and borrowed and sent me to college. I worked=20
my way through graduate school. I won a full tuition scholarship to law=20
school. All for the privilege of working 2,600 hours last year. That=20
works out to a 50 hour week, every week, without any vacation days at=20
all. I get to work by 9 am and rarely leave before 9 pm. I eat dinner at =

my office much more often than I eat dinner at home. My husband and I=20
paid over $70,000 in federal income tax last year. At some point in the=20
future, we will have to pay much more -- once this country faces its=20
deficit and the impossible burden of Social Security. In fact, the=20
areas of the country that supported Kerry -- New York, California,=20
Illinois, Massachusetts -- they are the financial centers of the=20
nation. They are the tax base of this country. How much did you pay,=20
Kansas? How much did you contribute to this government you support,=20
Alabama? How much of this war in Iraq did you pay for?

I am a liberal. The funny part is, liberals have this reputation for=20
living in Never-Neverland, being idealists, not being sensible. But let=20
me tell you how I see the world: I see America as one nation in a world=20
of nations. Therefore, I think we should try to get along with other=20
nations. I see that gay people exist. Therefore, I think they should be=20
allowed to exist, and be treated the same as other people. I see ways=20
in which women are not allowed to control their own bodies. Therefore,=20
I think we should give women more control over their bodies. I see that=20
people have awful diseases. Therefore, I think we should enable=20
scientists to try to cure them. I see that we have a Constitution.=20
Therefore, I think it should be upheld. I see that there were no weapons =

of mass destruction in Iraq. Therefore, I think that Iraq was not an=20
imminent danger to me. It seems so pragmatic to me.

I am an American. I have an American flag flying outside my home. I love =

my home more than anything. I love that I grew up right outside New York =

City. I first went to the Statue of Liberty with my 5th grade class,=20
and my mom and dad took me to the Empire State Building when I was 8. I=20
love taking the subway to Yankee Stadium.

I loved living in Washington DC and going on dates to the Lincoln=20
Memorial. It is because I love this country so much that I argue with my =

political opponents as much I do. I am not safe. I never feel safe. My=20
in-laws live in a small town in Ohio, and that town has received more=20
federal funding, per capita, for terrorism preparedness than New York=20
City has. I take subways and buses every day. I work in a skyscraper=20
across the street from a "target." I have emergency supplies and a spare =

pair of sneakers in my desk, in case something happens while I'm at=20
work. Do you? How many times a month do you worry that your subway is=20

know a single New Yorker who doesn't spend the month of September on=20
tip-toes, superstitiously praying for rain so we don't have to relive=20
that beautiful, blue-skied day.

I am lonely. I feel that we, as a nation, have alienated all our friends =

and further provoked our enemies. I feel unprotected. Most of all I=20
feel alienated from my fellow citizens, because I don't understand=20
what you are thinking. You voted for a man who started a war in Iraq for =

no reason, against the wishes of the entire world. You voted for a man=20
whose lack of foresight and inability to plan has led to massive=20
insurgencies in Iraq, where weapons are disappearing into the hands of=20
terrorists. You voted for a man who let Osama Bin Laden escape into the=20
hills of Afghanistan so that he could start that war in Iraq.

You voted for a man who doesn't want to let people love who they want=20
to love; doesn't want to let doctors cure their patients; doesn't want=20
to let women rule their destinies.

I don't understand why you voted for this man. For me, it is not enough=20
that he is personable; it is not enough that he seems like one of the=20
guys. Why did you vote for him? Why did you elect a man that lied to us=20
in order to convince us to go to war? (Ten years ago you were incensed=20
when our president lied about his sex life; you thought it was an=20
impeachable offense.) Why did you elect a leader who thinks that=20
strength cannot include diplomacy or international cooperation? Why did=20
you elect a man who did nothing except run away and hide on September =
11?

Most of all, I am terrified. I mean daily, I am afraid that I will not=20
survive this. I am afraid that I will lose my husband, that I will=20
never have children, that I will never grow old and watch the sunset in=20
a backyard of my own. I am afraid that my career -- which should end=20
with a triumphant and good-natured roast at a retirement party in 2035=20
-- will be cut short by an attack on me and my colleagues, as we sit=20
sending emails and making phone calls one ordinary afternoon.

Is your life at stake?

Are you terrified?

I don't think you are. I don't think you realize what you have done.

And if anything happens to me, or the people I love, I blame you.

I wanted you to know that.

ones are all but unreadable. however I've had
conversations with other poets who find pound
completely tiresome. lew welch said he "didn't
leave us any poetry."

as to the question of failure -- how can any poet
NOT fail?

I dont agree - Pond very fragmentaion was a
methodology - a valid one -sure his"a paradiso"
wasnt attained but many many other poets would say
the same (depending on teir mood at the time of
considering their work) - "failed"
maybe on his own terms but Ginsberg was right -
overall Pounds poetry and his work was a
success...see my short post on this...we know many
poets/artist who searched for the paradiso but of
course it was this very search/struggle that
matters - not even thepolitics of the poet. The
art is(almost all).

See also my short post on this.

If Pound failed then we are all doomed to
"failure".  How cana poet "fail"?

The following is from the above website:

Investigate Electronic Voting Machines - Contributed by Working Assets

Now that November 2 has come and gone, some disturbing reports of problems
with electronic voting machines have surfaced. For example:

*In Columbus, Ohio, an electronic voting system reported that Bush received
4,258 votes while Kerry received 260 votes in a precinct where records show
only 638 voters cast ballots;
* In North Carolina, a machine lost more than 4,500 votes due to a mistaken
assumption about the memory capacity of a computer;
* In Youngstown, Ohio, and South Florida, numerous voters complained that
when they tried to cast votes for Kerry, the machines instead recorded their
votes for Bush.

All in all, more than 30,000 complaints have been gathered from across the
country, and the Internet is heating up with rumors and innuendo that the
results of the election were somehow tampered with. In the midst of such
turmoil, it's crucial that an independent authoritative investigation be
undertaken to sort this all out.

Fortunately, a handful of representatives are working hard to get to the
bottom of the situation and have urged the Government Accountability Office
(GAO) to immediately investigate these charges. It's crucial that Congress
continues to pressure the GAO so that these problems can be investigated and
reported on to the American people to ensure that Americans' faith in the
election process is maintained and strengthened.

Call to action

Urge your representative to join Representatives Conyers, Scott, Nadler,
Watt, Wexler and Holt in calling on the Government Accountability Office to
immediately undertake an investigation of the efficacy of electronic voting
machines.

Never made the scene, the poetry scene, the jazz scene. But now I'm digging
the hip hop scene, enjoying the fusion which includes some jazz and lots of
poetry, heavy end and internal rhyming. This is all courtesy of my children. We
are a family of writers and artists though none of us makes our living by it.
One in particular, a clever and skillful lyricist, is encouraging me to learn
about its roots and gets me the underground and more authentic stuff. Rhyme and
driving rhythms aren't old school anymore. It's the current relevant music of
the street and protest and youth. What's more innovative than that? You even
get to learn a whole new language. The allusions require Herculean effort, at
least for this self-educated old woman. I admire their energy and conviction
about social issues, but I fear that they are a practical generation. Many are
now regretting their decisions not to vote. Impatiently, they'll expect
results and won't philosophize. I fear a growing onslaught of despair and cynicism
down the road, the futility of knowing the impotence of poetry and music. They
might actually take Jeffersonian principles seriously, but I'm sure our
government is already planning for that contingency.

lost baby, lost

lost in empty overtures
of over anxious music
banging beat up
black fire verse
stagnant hwyl
subservient fool
braced with swill
the crimson quill
defeats the truth and clash
and soon the verse
becomes the curse
and drowns the right
inside the night
and words the lines with death
death cannot die
the night at last
soft soft soft
but o o o
so dark

lost in questions
dismembering lies
structured sighs
trusted skills
in numbered overkills
between the curse
and the verse
the night of pain
there is no buzz
because
something something something
is still unknown
the ghost of song
has not numbered himself
in the heckling heresy
the broken joking
fluke of fear
dance a tearful ball
and recall
death for fun

lost
unable to detach from fear
those dots of light
cannot inflame the night
but only singe the unaware
with self destructive
human care
hearing
of verses rotting
and generals marching
in lines
waiting to play
pains music
one more time
and when the final
dirge is played
and all the notes
devour the scale
can you drink the human fear?
is music such a magic tea??

lost
no styptic symphony
to block the bloody tides
of human red reality
melting minds
and shrunken souls
can only seek insanity
a razor pen
to slash the paper wrists
to worthless dust
and fading ink
mumbling the stink
of insoluble distress
unable to find
dispassionate dirt
inactive discontent
contagious apathy
must slay
the Christ

robert, thanks, and just to say, i hear you... i'm looking for
politically efficacious actions, but i also think this is not good
enough over the long-term... call me a malcontent, i guess, but from
where i sit, we in the u.s. need to do a whole lot better... and in
case i've suggested otherwise, i'm sure kerry had his share of
dumbfucks (sorry) voting for him too (and setting aside this question
of formal education)... and i can't say i'm pleased about this...

in point of fact we need a more informed electorate if we're to cope
well with the kinds of problems we're facing, about to face... it's
not that i would condescend to the masses, you understand, but rather
that i don't think we can ignore our collective ignorance... i don't
say we'll ever persuade everyone to think like "we" do---but i
believe you can bring reasonable people to the table and manage to
persuade them to look at the picture a wee bit differently... what
kind of table? is one question i keep coming back to... and in what
i'm saying i assume only that incremental change over time is
possible... here too, i'm not suggesting that i'm so enlightened,
either, but i've been lucky to end up in a place (so to speak) where,
whatever else, i'm able to think these things through (that's one
kind of table, i suppose)... i just didn't have this kind of time on
my hands, and this kind of encouragement, when i worked in fortune
500... but maybe that's just me...

i don't know if anyone will find this encouraging, but:  here at isu
the overwhelming majority of students in my classes this term (that's
51 total) feel that gay marriages will be permitted within the next
two decades (i think my little surveys are fairly accurate)... that's
an awful long time to wait, i know, but my point is that this (far
from radical) student population in central illinois (a blue state, i
know) has, in the main, no issues with gays marrying... i like to see
this as a hopeful sign---i choose to see this as a hopeful sign...

best,

joe

I just wanted to say I like what Barry Watten (on his blog) is doing in
dialog with the quotes from the poetry of Kenneth Fearing. The interweaving
of both languages- compelling the so called 'past' into the present -
strikes me as a fruitful, intimate un-distancing work of the elders,
particular in this case to the work of Fearing where the presence of his
work and political engagement in the Depression - have been so obscured. (I
remember when I had Momo's Press - sometime in the very early eighties -
getting a call from his son who, I believe, lived in Portland. He was trying
desperately to get his father's work back into print. Sadly now, little help
was I).

Barry, I believe, in taking Fearing off the critical fringes of dismissal
(thank you my communist hating New Critic/Agragarian steeped mentors!)
 is providing a way to re-engage Fearing's language on its own terms,
putting its particulars back on the page, making them resonate with Barry's,
and letting that relationship conjure up potentially fresh interpretations.

In this obviously harrowing time (in which multiple issues are back on
'their' table) - for any of us at least two degrees left of center - I think
this up front dialog (conversation) with our forbears (obscure or not) is
compelling, vitally necessary, and a refreshing departure from familiar
critical discourse.

I look forward to more by Barry and others.

I knew that that was what you meant: but the question was angled somewhat
toward  - the implication - tat Pound had "failed - yes, he did, according
to what I know of his biog in his last years in Italy, feel he had failed. I
think that as to failure ... if we are talking about failure: all we or you
and I need to say is that we basically only fail on our own terms - or
subjectively we never fail. This is important - one defines  "success" as
basically being happy most of the time and also living life well aware that
that there are always problems. Most are solvable in some way. I if someone
else thinks you or I  or the person down the road to have "failed" that is
their problem - WE can choose to feel good about ourselves.

Pound, for example, was depressed and probably not well - he was old when he
decided he had "failed" but he survived to 70 or so and wrote a lot of
poetry etc had some children (or a daughter? one son?) in no way is that a
failure.

But as to "failure" its probably a good thing to actually practice it -  as
learning to cope with setbacks and failures is part of life - take my own
writing I am fairly indifferent as to how they are received or even who or
if they are read. I enjoyed writing many of them but whether critics will
ever approve of them in the future I am completely  - or very - indifferent
to.  I like seeing them in print but, not being ever published would have
little affect on my life...
It would be nice to win 2 million$ but it probably wont happen!!  So I get
on with life.

I am/or have been (with Cookson's crib)..working through the Cantos and I
find that they are fascinating - have to admit I haven't read them
all.....and yes the "middle" stuff seems dry.....

But I think Lew Welch didn't know what he was talking about.

Did anyone bother to read the comments by Bacigalupo and Gibson at the
referenced link? In the context of his personal project, Pound failed in his own
eyes. The philosophical question should be whether his goal was attainable. That
was the intended slant of the question. Defining success is definitely
subjective, and happiness is certainly no indicator of anything other than being
happy.

There is so much on line one gets overwhelmed with information - but I read
a biography recently about Pound: and in his last years he couldn't write -
felt he had failed  - said he had - previously T S Eliot had assured him he
would be of great significance for (a long time ) to come - "forever" - like
Shakespeare etc)...I think we are in agreement basically - but whether his
work was major or failed or whatever is - well its been debated forever
already - but it leads to the a larger question as to what a poet should
aspire to do - were and why is a poet doing what he/she is doing (personally
by the way I don't like "rap " poetry that rhymes or whatever) but I can see
the importance to the culture of such stuff  (Steve Dalchinsky is hipping
along with some great stuff - that's one way to go) - some how if one can
coordinate the 'pop' with the 'high' stuff one is onto it..maybe another
example is Alan Sondheim - but Alan gets into the material of his production
much as an artist might get right into the technology or materials of his
craft - some NZ artists I can think of like that (there were many) include
Billy Apple, Len Lye, Richard Killeen..Dalchinsky highlights the energy of
the moment so to speak and maybe is closer to the trad of Ted Berrigan and
so on ..Pound to swing away... was very much obsessed with the "mainstream "
high culture - but as Charles Bernstein points out (in A Poetics  "Pounding
Fascism")-  his fragmenting and the deliberate use of the of the polyvocal
(yes it was mainly Eurocentric but it was a beginning)  in his work ( or the
attempt there off) was a counter to his valorisation of the "tradition"
(Ovid etc etc)  [in contrast his friend Williams Carlos Williams stayed in
the US and engaged with the working and the local people (not always
"popular culture (is 'popular culture' 'working class' culture I was asked
by a friend and fellow poet the other day)] all of this muddied by his
hatred of usury which turned to  hatred of Jews which was ironical (and sad)
because many who helped him were Jewish -  Ginsberg, Zukofsky and many
others....

There are many cases of writers etc repudiating their work at their life's
end - Kafka wanted everything he wrote burnt -  but note that Pound didn't
give such instructions!

Many many writers owe an enormous debt to Pound - he as indeed like a vortex
energising the literary world: he bucked the system, he joined forces with
Mussolini - but in that area he was "nutty" and cranky - he had some good
points about the wastefulness of US/European capitalism but his choice of
fascism instead was unwise - he was maybe victimised by the US army and Govt
who didn't really help the Jews very much....good to hammer Pound to take
attention away from  your 'failings': there is evidence that some of the top
nazis were taken into the US Govt net (the obvious example is von Braun)  -
so he had a "point" but he was very clumsy in making it - his politics were
(while maybe having some 'truth' - were very patchy and often incoherent -
he was an anti-Semite who had many very close Jewish friends - his work
remains.

Our challenge is to work on projects that may be beautiful and interesting
and challenging but also serve not to attack any particular people
(hopefully to find common ground with many people  - and yet not to be
scared to attack untruth or injustice when we see it or feel it is there:
and to create something new and vital) and avoid the traps Pound - in his
enormous enthusiasm for beauty and culture and art and history- trapped
himself into.

Frist in the Senate is promising to end the practice of filibustering
once
and for all. The Repubs only need a majority to effectively change
Senate law and accomplish this goal. They have the majority. There
doesn't have to be the 60-member majority to do this and there
won't be any filibustering of the move to end filibustering.

After this happens, Repubs will be sitting in the White House, ruling
Congress and on the verge of stacking the Supreme Court with
Republican judges with lifetime appointments.

The factor missing from this equation is the American people. There
were quite a few people that did not vote for Bush.

I think it's time we talk about how to organize and how to mobilize.

Iris Chang on the Rape of Nanking...


"Many soldiers went beyond rape to
disembowel women, slice off their breasts,
nail them alive to walls...Fathers were forced
to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers,
as other family members watched. Not only did
live burials, castration, the carving of organs and
the roasting of people become routine, but still
more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as
hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks
or burying people to their waists and watching
them torn apart by German shepherds. So
sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis
in the city were horrified...

Dear all: I've just found out that, sadly, perhaps as far back as
March or April 2004 someone has been sending out back-channel
reprimands to subscribers suggesting that these subscribers are
disturbing the list-dynamic and that they should consider leaving the
list.  *Please note* that all correspondence concerning the moderation
of the list has and always will come from poetics@buffalo.edu

Also, I'd like to point out that since the list is unmoderated in the
sense that messages from subscribers are sent directly out to the list
and are only moderated, and only if necessary, after (by an email from
poetics@buffalo.edu), if your posts are delayed it is because the
listserv software is slow or the university server is experiencing
difficulties.  In other words, unless your post is a flame, nothing is
censored on the list.

all my best,
Lori Emerson
listserv moderator

Such a wonderful historian with a promising career but no future, one that
would have continued to enlighten us to for decades. Her tragic suicide
yesterday at such a young age is testimony to all that is terribly wrong in this world
- her subject matter, man's humanity to man; and her mental fragility,
something which can be diagnosed and barely managed but not cured. A quiet desperate
futility.

my mother's name was Iris
put a bullet
in her heart
to end the voices
in her head
to stop seeing hitler
underneath the bed
she too died
     on 11/11

eleven years later
i bounced down
the side of a mountain
     on 11/11
in a pick-up truck
nearly died

oh yeah

The writer on the list used the expression "lashing out" as - was it the
post about the return of the authoritarian personality? Already receding
in memory, the flash of a phrase and its fleeting moment, attention, and
inscription: where? The posts themselves, whatever the list, participate
in the incompleteness that is part of what they are, and whatever else
they are, they are not material objects.

"An act of pure malice is no easier to realize than an act of pure
goodness. What is more, it is by no means certain that we could even
distinguish between a pure act of malice and a pure act of goodness,
since they would have exactly the same structure" (Zupancic 90).

Or: "As we have known since Althusser, the salient or obvious features
of a situation, which are supposed to protect us from self-deception,
can in fact involve the most refined form of self-deception. Every
ideology works hard to make certain things 'obvious', and the more we
find these things obvious, self-evident and unquestionable, the more
successfully the ideology has done its job. If we accept Allison's
suggestions - that _there is something in reality on which we can rely_
when we are testing our maxims - then we must also accept the logic
underlying the following maxim: 'Act in such a way that the Fuhrer, if
he knew about your actions, would approve of it" (Zupancic 93).

For: "The fundamental ideological gesture consists in providing an image
for this structural 'evil'. The gap opened by an act (i.e. the
unfamiliar, 'out-of-place' effect of an act) is immediately linked in
this ideological gesture to an _image_. As a rule this is an image of
suffering...." (Zupancic 95).

From an earlier chapter, "The Sadean Trap": "Suppose I have a violent
dislike for someone, and have come into a piece of information about
him, which I know will cause him great pain if he learns of it. With the
intent of causing him pain, I decide to inform him of the matter, but I
justify this action to myself on the grounds of his right to know.
Accordingly, rather than admitting that this is a vicious act of
inflicting unnecessary pain on another, I represent it to myself (and
perhaps to others) as a laudable act of truth-telling. I might even
convince myself that it is my sacred duty. Allison takes this example to
illustrate what he calls the 'self-deception' by means of which we are
able to ignore 'the morally salient factor(s)' of a situation. We will
take this example, however, as an illustration of something else: the
perverse attitude which consists in presenting our duty as an excuse for
our actions. What is more, we are dealing here with a case of _double_
self-deception.

The first moment of self-deception is the one pointed out by Allison: we
deceive ourselves as to our actual intention, which is to hurt another.
But this self-deception is possible only on the basis of another, more
fundamental moment of self-deception. It is possible only in so far as
we take (the 'content' of) our duty to be 'ready-made', pre-existing our
involvement in the situation. This is why it would be impossible to
expose this person's actions as hypocritical by saying to him: 'We know
that your real intention was to hurt another person.'" (Zupancic 58-9).

So: "This is why we have to maintain that it is only the act which opens
up a universal horizon or posits the universal, not that the latter,
being already established, allows us to 'guess' what our duty is, and
delivers a guarantee against misconceiving it. At the same time, this
theoretical stance has the advantage of making it impossible for the
subject to assume the perverse attitude we discussed in Chapter 3: the
subject cannot hide behind her duty - she is responsible for what she
refers to as her duty.

And: This brings us back to the indistinguishability of good and evil.
What exactly can this mean? Let us start with what it does not mean. It
does not refer to the _incertitude_ as to whether an act is (or was)
'good' or 'bad'. It refers to the fact that the very structure of the
act is foreign to the register constituted by the couplet good/bad -
that it is neither good nor bad" (Zupancic 94).

Work Cited

Alenka Zupancic, Ethics of the Real. London: Verso, 2000. [However, in
Kia Lindroos, Now-Time/Image-Space, Jyvaskyla: SoPhi, 1999: "After
studying Kant more carefully, Benjamin rejected this thought, because,
although he had always admired Kant's systematic thinking, he came to
resist Kant's 'thoroughgoing ethical interest.' Kantian ethics leads,
according to Benjamin, to ignoring the aspects of the historico-
philosophical." (The footnote points to May 1918 - the date itself
should suggest a certain impatience with ethics - and Lindroos returns
elsewhere to Kant's presence in Benjamin's thought)].

to say Pound failed is to show ignorance of failure that is many times
success- Pound is the most important poet of the Modernist period because he
opened up new ways of doing poetry fused with old ways and this bridge makes
him important.  I don't really care what Pound's personal or scholarly goals
were- he was a master and remains so.

I recall when I worked for Greenpeace *everyone* smoked. They gave me
sh*t for buying a burger in a (gasp!) styrofoam container, then
proceeded to dump carcinogens in their lungs & go on about how much
pot they were going to smoke that night.

I found it a bit hypocritical that people would spend their days
rallying against pollution, then proceed to pollute the single
environment they had the most control over.

My guess is that the Republicans would only want to end filibustering
temporarily--i.e., until they're out of power, when, again, filibustering
would become a Good Thing.

To be fair, there are ways to inhale pot (bong, vaporizer) more safely;
it takes less pot to catch the required buzz than it does tobacco, so pot
smokers inhale less total material; and nobody with even a single brain
cell left would ruin good bud with the kind of chemicals routinely added
to cigarettes. It is, of course (hi, Alice B.!), possible to ingest
cannabis or take it sublingually, but smoking it makes it easier to
titrate the dosage -- translation: it's easier to eat Way Too Much than it
is to smoke too much.

I hope everyone here (or has participated in this discussion) is aware of
the new personal documentary by Ross McElwee, "Bright Leaves," which is,
as all his work, ingratiating and illuminating, and what's more by a
Southerner who has tangential connections to tobacco.  now of course there
is another cash crop in Carolina, though it remains untaxed.

I might have said somewhere back  that I belong to a small Zukofsky reading
group. We have been reading "A"; currently we have just finished "A-13"
which is a kind of silly thing to say. There is probably no way that anyone
ever finishes, or exhausts the interpretive possibilities of most parts of
"A".

Which is not say there is not a unity and joy to be found in the parts. The
night at home I read Part III of A-13 aloud to Sandy, my partner. She was
cooking and perhaps I was literally singing for my supper! The textual music
inherrent in Zukofsky's language is terrific and various - one might say
(for "13") similar to riding the bow over the strings of a violin, from
choppy intense strokes to extended melodies inner-spliced with counter
melodies - spare to flush. One cannot escape the pulse of the work. It's a
body in constant movement. Without going into detail here, the shifts Z
makes are frequently full of wit and reversals of expectation (I suspect
influenced, no doubt, by Joyce).

At the same the interpretation of the work - line upon line - is a different
challenge. A line or series of lines may constitute a seemingly entirely
lucid proposal followed by a multiple layering of lines that suggest meaning
but then appear to betray the meaning. It can be crazy making - on one hand,
one gets embraced by the forays of the music and yet, on the other, one
cannot gain an equally immediate take on what is being said or argued. The
lines have a historical resonance (or allusion) with some other literature
and yet seem cut the resonance or reference in half. There is also the
complicating factor of the wit - Chaplinese, as Steve Ford has beautifully
illustrated - which throws off rhetorical pomposity. It would be a little
like stopping Ornette Colman's early trio in the middle of a collaborative
improv to inquire 'what's the statement here.'

So tonight - in group - we sit in John Norton's living room reading parts of
A-13 aloud while facing Google on the monitor. We stop every time we come to
a phrase that resonates and plug its key words into the search engine. It's
not exactly a riot, but absolutely intriguing "God's spies", "Monkey God",
the Horse/Honesty" take us, for example, to Lear, to Hindu Mythology, and to
Aristotle. Rich references to read in themselves. Yet, we know that using
these references - even if they broaden a specific horizon within the
reading - they do not become a closed means of explication.
Instead, Zukfosky becomes this collage artist or, perhaps, "cobbler" would
be his association - cobbling together these pieces into something uniquely
on their own, a rapidly reeling montage of discrete parts shaped by the
poem's shifting formal structures.

This is not to say there is no meaning here. But the meaning is in the
improvisatory enjambment between structure, movement and content. It's the
way one - the reader's eye & ear - move between these three elements that
give the work an incorporative meaning or - in Zuk's terms - a way of
seeing, living and loving. There's a full there, there.

It *crashed* your -network-? Wow! That is impressive.

Firewalls, usually, have nothing to do with virus checking. Firewalls just
handle port blocking and masquerading. They stop other machines directly
contacting your internal machines. The virus payload can still get through
in email. The virus scanning of emails is usually done in conjunction with
a  mail server. Now, crashing your mail server or the machine on which the
virus scanner runs, I can just about get a handle on but it takes an
*awful* lot to crash a network. Like the power-cuts last year. Legend has
it that a payload carrying laptop was connected to the internal network of
a power company, the virus was injected into the machines on the network
and everything brought to halt by, I think, a denial-of-service virus.

Hi Gwyn

Thanks for posting this. I chain-smoked cigarettes for 5 years and can
assure you pot does a lot less damage to my lungs than cigarettes. My chest
X-rays have been clear for the past 40 years or more & my vices go back even
further than that.

Eating it has never worked well for me.

To be fair, there are ways to inhale pot (bong, vaporizer) more safely;
it takes less pot to catch the required buzz than it does tobacco, so pot
smokers inhale less total material; and nobody with even a single brain
cell left would ruin good bud with the kind of chemicals routinely added
to cigarettes. It is, of course (hi, Alice B.!), possible to ingest
cannabis or take it sublingually, but smoking it makes it easier to
titrate the dosage -- translation: it's easier to eat Way Too Much than it
is to smoke too much.

The majority of the electorate just voted for a one-party system, which,
when that party doesn't believe in democracy, is called a dictatorship.
We'll see this emerging in the next few months. Entrenched power is very
difficult to overturn without a bloody revolution, which none of us want.
After all, besides the White House, Congress, and soon the courts; and
besides most of the media, they also own the voting machines. We'll watch
their moves, and see how much the millions of people who didn't vote for
them will tolerate. This calls for a new American Poetry, much like the
Third World has had for a long time.

Yes I read these and it's a wonderful resource, I
especially appreciate the different takes on some
of these questions and explorations of various
Cant-os.

I think we're all variously in more or less
agreement on this and just kicking up dust over
the finer points. I grokked the slant of the
question and that was the spirit in which I tried
to answer it. No one who's a serious poet or
plumber or anything can possibly avoid "failure"
-- nor should it be avoided. Then it remains to
define "failure" which is completely subjective.
YES Pound failed but he saw a paradiso completely
unattainable... what we are left with are the
beautiful shards glimmering in the poems
reflecting and refracting that paradise.

I was really thinking of Keats. Endymion was a
total failure by almost any standard and he could
have easily packed it in ("Back to the shop,
Johnny boy!" sd one critic). Even his brilliant
successes of a few years later ("Eve of St.
Agnes," the Odes, "Lamia") he hardly thought
enough of to bother publishing. In a way you could
say that any artist who doesn't set him or herself
up to fail by reaching for unattainable goals is
not worth bothering with.

As for Lew Welch -- he was a known curmudgeon --
was unsatisfied with 90% of his own poetry and
ripped most of it to shreds -- said that Keats had
made a major mistake in his poem "La Belle Dame
Sans Merci" by putting

"No birds sing"

instead of

"No bird sings"

and said of Pound that he had some marvelous ideas
but "didn't leave us with any poetry, finally"
which I put out there as one poet's take. I know
there are others who share that notion, tho I'm
not one of them.

Did anyone bother to read the comments by

the context of his personal project, Pound failed
in his own eyes. The philosophical question should
be whether his goal was attainable. That was the

I don't really think that IS the philosophical question, or the critical
question. The question is more -- what DO the poems attain, what DO they
achieve, and HOW do they achieve it, and HOW do they work? Whether or not
the goal was attainable doesn't really say much about what value the poems
have.

Of course it's even easier to eat way too much after smoking even a little.
Or so I'm told.

hmmmm, well I don't know. I think your questions
are approaching the unattainable in terms of
getting answered in this forum -- and I'm not
trying to be a smartass. Well, maybe a little bit.
I took a semester-long course on Pound a year ago
in which we deeply explored the Cantos and I feel
like I'm barely prepared to begin speaking about
"how they work," etc. I think Richard hit on
something when he spoke about the fragmentary
quality which was certainly deliberate, but there
are many strains of approach at work here, from
translation to "imagism" to "repitition in a finer
tone" -- agh, too much for an e-mail. One approach
might be to think about the ways in which Pound
has affected those around him, from H.D. to
Zukofsky to Creeley to Olsen to...

on a separate note:

I just went for a walk through our fair city to go
to the bank and get a burrito and thought more
about this question of "success/failure" and back
to the "relevancy/irrelevancy" question I posed
last week post-election with regards to poetry.
This came from Diane di Prima and I thought I'd
share it:

[What I can offer is, all of it, from the poets.
This is what comes to
mind
most often:


"I am certain of nothing but the Holiness of the
Heart's Affection and
the
Truth of the Imagination.. . . What the
Imagination seizes as Beauty
must be
true, even if it never existed before."   (John
Keats)


Peace.

Diane di Prima]

After the deep depression of last week, there's
almost a sense of relief in knowing that one is
engaged with a project the relevancy or
irrelevancy of which will never be known during
one's lifetime or perhaps at all. All notions of
success or failure completely drop away when the
project is conceived of in terms of a lifelong
struggle, and even moreso when that struggle is
situated in the context of all poets struggling at
all times, continuously throughout history. In my
own world, I know that presenting some piece of
work has more to do with achieving a level of
"failure" I'm comfortable with -- in other words
this will never be what I hoped it would but
working on it more will yield no further results
-- the sense of satisfaction comes in feeling that
one's done all one can with the material over
time, not ever with the finished product itself.

Hi Derek,

I don't know what you're asking from Alan, unless it's to go away. I
disagree, but that's OK, that's your perogative. However:

"Spammers" don't send viruses; they send spam. Viruses are often attached to
spam by other parties, but "spammers" are salespeople with no motive to
destroy your computer. "Image links" are nothing but text. Of course it
makes sense to send image links to this list. Raymond misdiagnosed whatever
sort of problems he had, which is fine, no harm done, but no one should be
expected to care, either. The strangeness of the missive made it obvious it
was Alan, and not a virus impersonating him (I doubt that was his motive,
just an unexpected advantage). There is a technological reason for Alan to
consider using .jpgs instead of .pngs, but you didn't suggest that. .html
files (I don't know what an "HTML-resolving URL" is supposed to be; if you
mean http-resolving, his URLs were http-resolving) are potentially
virus-vulnerable as well.

Hope that helps,

funny, we go through this every couple of years, an "alan please
stop" thread with defenders and attackers of sondheim. i'm writing
about sondheim now, and am addressing this very phenomenon, the cycle
of anti-alanism that pops up.  but the last one ("ah dear me") was
fairly recent.  i'm postulating that sondheim's compulsive posting is
a diaspora poetics characteristic, part of a kind of exhaustiveness
or excess that is at the same time always by necessity incomplete. it
is part of what i'm calling an "ethical commitment to debris" rather
than an effect of "lazy editing" or some other protestant-shame
indicator of a fear of expressive excess.

Any unsolicited email is considered spam Jonathan. Viruses arriving via
email are pretty much unsolicited. Come on now. Read the security
article I thoughtfully included.



..|  "Image links" are nothing but text

Yes, but if users click on them they can execute malicious programs from
the hosting server. This is the security risk. Please don't post
claiming how knowledgeable email/web users are. Read the security
article I thoughtfully included.



..|  Raymond misdiagnosed whatever

Raymond claimed his software was recognizing Alan's posts as a virus +
his network crashed (presumably the network 'stopped' because a
suspected virus carrier was found). There does not appear to be any
misdiagnosis. (Imagine confusing Alan's work with a virus!!) Please read
the security article I thoughtfully included.


..|  I don't know what an "HTML-resolving URL"
..|  is supposed to be

An "HTML-resolving URL" is a URL which resolves to a hyper-text document
(a .html extension) and not to an image (ie. a .png extension).
HyperText documents have the advantage of being Mark-up Languages --
which means you can do all kinds of crazy stuff with them on your server
and the list only needs to see one single URL. This is how the web
works. Many people publicize their blogs and other activities on po-list
in this unobtrusive and reasonable way. At some simple point it is just
stupid not to ask someone to stop yelling in your ear.


..|  I don't know what you're asking from Alan

I'm asking Alan if it is necessary to post his work daily here while
pointing out he his overexposed on this list. Yes, this is a question.
Can Alan Sondheim exist outside of this po-list? Does he dare try
something new?

Maria-

The way you put this elicited a very
pleasurable form of list nostalgia for me-
and a fine opportunity to express
appreciation for Sondheim's ongoing crucial work here-
and in particular his recent post about the election
that was so strongly responded to by a number of poetics bloggers.
By the way, it was also pleasant to some
long awaited synergy between the list
and the blogs, and no surprise that Alan's
work should be the lightning rod for this as
well.

Ah..."expressive excess." I wonder if'
you've dubbed a new poetics movement here-
* Excessivism*

best wishes,
Nick

ah, the jew as lightning rod...reminds me of an essay i wrote on
lenny bruce, which someone on the list helped steer toward
"postmodern culture" for publication, i think it was juliana spahr;
the list has an "impressive roster" of graduates...  i owe a lot to
the list, not the least of which is my introduction to sondheim's
work, to piombino, vincent, and other poetics comrades, the flarf
crowd (actually i knew gary s in mpls), and many other groovoids,
trendoids and voidoids.

Frank Rich: On 'Moral Values,' It's Blue in a Landslide

November 14, 2004




FAREWELL to Swift boats and "Shove it!," to Osama's tape and Saddam's
missing weapons, to "security moms" and outsourced dads. They've all been
sent to history's dustbin faster than Ralph Nader memorabilia was dumped on
eBay. In their stead stands a single ambiguous phrase coined by an anonymous
exit pollster: "Moral values." By near universal agreement the morning
after, these two words tell the entire story of the election: it's the
culture, stupid.

"It really is Michael Moore versus Mel Gibson," said Newt Gingrich. To Jon
Stewart, Nov. 2 was the red states'
revenge on "Will & Grace." William Safire, speaking on "Meet the Press,"
called the Janet Jackson fracas "the social-political event of the past
year." Karl Rove was of the same mind: "I think it's people who are
concerned about the coarseness of our culture, about what they see on the
television sets, what they see in the movies ..."

And let's not even get started on the two most dreaded words in American
comedy, regardless of your party
affiliation: Whoopi Goldberg.

There's only one problem with the storyline proclaiming that the country
swung to the right on cultural issues in 2004. Like so many other narratives
that immediately calcify into our 24/7 media's conventional wisdom, it is
fiction. Everything about the election results - and about American culture
itself - confirms an inescapable reality:
John Kerry's defeat notwithstanding, it's blue America, not red, that is
inexorably winning the culture war, and by a landslide. Kerry voters who
have been flagellating themselves since Election Day with a vengeance worthy
of "The Passion of the Christ" should wake up and smell the Chardonnay.

The blue ascendancy is nearly as strong among Republicans as it is among
Democrats. Those whose "moral values" are invested in cultural heroes like
the accused loofah fetishist Bill O'Reilly and the self-gratifying drug
consumer Rush Limbaugh are surely joking when they turn apoplectic over MTV.
William Bennett's name is now as synonymous with Las Vegas as silicone. The
Democrats'
Ashton Kutcher is trumped by the Republicans' Britney Spears. Excess and
vulgarity, as always, enjoy a vast, bipartisan constituency, and in a
democracy no political party will ever stamp them out.

If anyone is laughing all the way to the bank this election year, it must be
the undisputed king of the red cultural elite, Rupert Murdoch. Fox News is a
rising profit center within his News Corporation, and each red-state dollar
that it makes can be plowed back into the rest of Fox's very blue
entertainment portfolio. The Murdoch cultural stable includes recent books
like Jenna Jameson's "How to Make Love Like a Porn Star" and the Vivid
Girls' "How to Have a XXX Sex Life," which have both been synergistically,
even joyously, promoted on Fox News by willing hosts like Rita Cosby and,
needless to say, Mr. O'Reilly. There are "real fun parts and exciting
parts," said Ms. Cosby to Ms.
Jameson on Fox News's "Big Story Weekend," an encounter broadcast on
Saturday at 9 p.m., assuring its maximum exposure to unsupervised kids.

Almost unnoticed in the final weeks of the campaign was the record
government indecency fine levied against another prime-time Fox television
product, "Married by America."
The $1.2 million bill, a mere bagatelle to Murdoch stockholders, was more
than twice the punishment inflicted on Viacom for Janet Jackson's "wardrobe
malfunction."
According to the F.C.C. complaint, one episode in this heterosexual
marriage-promoting reality show included scenes in which "partygoers lick
whipped cream from strippers' bodies," and two female strippers "playfully
spank" a man on all fours in his underwear. "Married by America" is gone
now, but Fox remains the go-to network for Paris Hilton ("The Simple Life")
and wife-swapping ("Trading Spouses: Meet Your New Mommy").

None of this has prompted an uprising from the red-state Fox News loyalists
supposedly so preoccupied with "moral values." They all gladly contribute
fungible dollars to Fox culture by boosting their fair-and-balanced
channel's rise in the ratings. Some of these red staters may want to make
love like porn stars besides. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)
An ABC News poll two weeks before the election found that more Republicans
than Democrats enjoy sex "a great deal." The Democrats' new hero, Illinois
Senator-elect Barack Obama, was assured victory once his original,
ostentatiously pious Republican opponent, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race
rather than defend his taste for "avant-garde" sex clubs.

The 22 percent of voters who told pollsters that "moral values" were their
top election issue - 79 percent of whom voted for Bush-Cheney - corresponds
almost exactly to the number of voters (23 percent) who describe themselves
as born-again or evangelical Christians. They are entitled to their culture,
too, and their own entertainment industry.
And their own show-biz scandals. The Los Angeles Times reported this summer
that Paul Crouch, the evangelist who founded the largest Christian network,
Trinity Broadcasting Network, vehemently denied a former employee's
accusation that the two had had a homosexual encounter - though not before
paying the employee a $425,000 settlement. Not so incidentally, Trinity
joined Gary Bauer and Fox News as prime movers in "Redeem the Vote," the
Christian-rock alternative to MTV's "Rock the Vote."

But the distance between this hard-core red culture and the majority blue
culture is perhaps best captured by Tom Coburn, the newly elected Republican
senator from Oklahoma, lately famous for discovering "rampant" lesbianism in
that state's schools. As a congressman in 1997, Mr. Coburn attacked NBC for
encouraging "irresponsible sexual behavior" and taking "network TV to an
all-time low with full frontal nudity, violence and profanity being shown in
our homes." The broadcast that prompted his outrage on behalf of "parents
and decent-minded individuals everywhere" was the network's prime-time
showing of Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List."

It's in the G.O.P.'s interest to pander to this far-right constituency -
votes are votes - but you can be certain that a party joined at the hip to
much of corporate America, Mr. Murdoch included, will take no action to
curtail the blue culture these voters deplore. As Marshall Wittman, an
independent-minded former associate of both Ralph Reed and John McCain,
wrote before the election, "The only things the religious conservatives get
are largely symbolic votes on proposals guaranteed to fail, such as the gay
marriage constitutional amendment." That amendment has never had a prayer of
rounding up the two-thirds majority needed for passage and still doesn't.

Mr. Wittman echoes Thomas Frank, the author of "What's the Matter With
Kansas?," by common consent the year's most prescient political book.
"Values," Mr. Frank writes, "always take a backseat to the needs of money
once the elections are won." Under this perennial "trick," as he calls it,
Republican politicians promise to stop abortion and force the culture
industry "to clean up its act" - until the votes are counted. Then they
return to their higher priorities, like cutting capital gains and estate
taxes. Mr. Murdoch and his fellow cultural barons - from Sumner Redstone,
the Bush-endorsing C.E.O. of Viacom, to Richard Parsons, the Republican
C.E.O. of Time Warner, to Jeffrey Immelt, the Bush-contributing C.E.O. of
G.E. (NBC
Universal) - are about to be rewarded not just with more tax breaks but also
with deregulatory goodies increasing their power to market salacious
entertainment. It's they, not Susan Sarandon and Bruce Springsteen, who
actually set the cultural agenda Gary Bauer and company say they despise.

But it's not only the G.O.P.'s fealty to its financial backers that is
predictive of how little cultural bang the "values" voters will get for
their Bush-Cheney votes. At 78 percent, the nonvalues voters have far more
votes than they do, and both parties will cater to that overwhelming
majority's blue tastes first and last. Their mandate is
clear: The same poll that clocked "moral values" partisans at 22 percent of
the electorate found that nearly three times as many Americans approve of
some form of legal status for gay couples, whether civil unions (35 percent)
or marriage (27 percent). Do the math and you'll find that the poll also
shows that for all the G.O.P.'s efforts to court Jews, the total number of
Jewish Republican voters in 2004, while up from 2000, was still some 200,000
less than the number of gay Republican voters.

When Robert Novak writes after the election that "the anti-abortion,
anti-gay marriage, socially conservative agenda is ascendant, and the G.O.P.
will not abandon it anytime soon," you have to wonder what drug he is on.
The abandonment began at the convention. Sam Brownback, the Kansas senator
who champions the religious right, was locked away in an off-camera rally
across town from Madison Square Garden. Prime time was bestowed upon the
three biggest stars in post-Bush Republican politics: Rudy Giuliani, John
McCain and Arnold Schwarzenegger. All are supporters of gay rights and
opponents of the same-sex marriage constitutional amendment. Only Mr. McCain
calls himself pro-life, and he's never made abortion a cause.
None of the three support the Bush administration position on stem-cell
research. When the No. 1 "moral values" movie star, Mel Gibson, condemned
the Schwarzenegger-endorsed California ballot initiative expanding and
financing stem-cell research, the governor and voters crushed him like a
girlie-man. The measure carried by 59 percent, which is consistent with
national polling on the issue.

If the Republican party's next round of leaders are all cool with blue
culture, why should Democrats run after the red? Received Washington wisdom
has it that the only Democrat who will ever be able to win a national
election must be a cross between Gomer Pyle and Billy Sunday - a
Scripture-quoting Sun Belt exurbanite whose loyalty to Nascar does not
extend to Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was fined last month for saying a
four-letter word on television.

According to this argument, the values voters the Democrats must pander to
are people like Cary and Tara Leslie, archetypal Ohio evangelical "Bush
votes come to life"
apotheosized by The Washington Post right after Election Day. The Leslies
swear by "moral absolutes," support a constitutional ban on same-sex
marriage and mostly watch Fox News. Mr. Leslie has also watched his income
drop from $55,000 to $35,000 since 2001, forcing himself, his wife and his
three young children into the ranks of what he calls the "working poor."
Maybe by 2008 some Democrat will figure out how to persuade him that it
might be a higher moral value to worry about the future of his own family
than some gay family he hasn't even met.

Derek, m'man, I did spam, viruses, and networks for a living for six years.
You can take any tone you want, but you've defined the Social Security
Administration (not to mention InterNIC) as a spammer and told me that
Raymond's "network" was "crashed" by a 2k text document. I am insufficiently
ignorant to have this discussion with you, and I have no need to humor you.
Thanks anyway.

Oh, that's fine. Rage, rage against the machine there, I'm down with that.
But please refrain from spreading factual ignorance of technology while you
do it. I *hate* factual ignorance of technology. Bad taste, hey, preach it,
that's what a poetics list is all about.

This evening as I was waiting for my youngest daughter, who was attending her
volleyball awards ceremony, I tried to put into words my take on failure and
success. I understand Diane di Prima's path. I respect Ezra Pound's and Laura
Riding's projects. Don't necessarily like all their poetry or some of their
politics, but I admire anyone who believes in human dignity and potential. We
all fail a bit and succeed some, but this is as good as it gets so far. Each
story is different.

which scene did I make?
the one that I made
you can't take it out of me
me out of it
no scene
no me

first, it's shaped by others
then you escape and flow into his
other-worded spaces
grow yourself a home to
last, because you want it
you make it

          recipe for loving ideas
          'cause people let you down
          snatch yourself a poet
          get knocked up
          first accidental choice
          make mistake six more times

doesn't appear this green bed
appeals to most others
blue collar hands full of making
all nighter utopian daydreams
poetry adventures laughter
intimacy beyond measure

          welding burned arthritic calloused
          he sucks my full milky breasts
          and he comes deep inside me
          just a woman who wanted it all
          so much new life
          such a kind and lovely failure

Periodic anti-alan is one of the continuities in the list. This is an honor=20

a great, suggestive phrase.

Jonathan, you are just being silly. Yes spamming can and does involve
viruses. How do you think viruses reach your computer? I'm not going to
play a childish game with you. There's a link-> I too have worked
several years in the IT industry. Look it up. I didn't ask you to jump
onto this conversation and it is obvious why you did -- to stop talking.
Mission accomplished adieu Jonathan mR. Expert

Meanwhile, 'debris' and 'excess' go the way of pervasive advertising, I
suppose.

I am struck by the opposite notion, that is a "counter-commitment to
(making) ethical debris."

Such as the current Administration's trail thereof (contra-convening the
Genena Accords on torture, right to trials, etc.,) and then nominating the
man responsible for 're-constructing' the language to support those
contraventions to be the Nation's next Attorney General.

Bit spooky, I think, making a sport of turning the Constitution into
"ethical  debris."

Hate to sound so Protestant!  But if Alan's commitment is to waging war
here, keep shoveling the debris, Alan, jpeg by jpeg. & may this list
continue to be one of your wheelbarrows. It'll be nice to ultimately see a
rebuilt foundation. But, I assume, beyond the work of Alan, that's the work
of everybody. =20

The commodification of a literary figure usually means the author has been
accepted into the American Mainstream culture. Commodification usually means
the literary lion has lost its teeth and should only appear in ads for
graham crackers in milk. To my knowledge, there have been only two
exceptions to this rule: William Burroughs, who may or may not have actually
worn Nikes; and

(taa-daa)



me.


I can't say that I've achieved commodification through my work as a poet.
Rather, it's my fiction that has brought me what many would consider the
kiss of death. In this case, it's a breath of life.

Jonathan Penton, the irreverent editor of Unlikely Stories
(www.unlikelystories.org) has commodified me by creating an entire product
line from my novel COMMERCIAL FICTION. If you haven't read the book, you can
purchase it through your online bookseller or read it online at:


http://www.unlikelystories.org/cgi_bin/fcp.pl?words=commercial+fiction&wt=ew
&bl=or&d=/frazer0604.shtml

If  you find you're not up to the challenge of reading COMMERICAL FICTION
(the foremost being not to fall onto the floor while writhing with
laughter), you don't have to exhaust yourself by actually reading my work.
Instead, you can relax with your choice of COMMERCIAL FICTI0N T-shirts,
coffee mugs, tote bags, thong underwear (with my name on them. Does this
make me a HOT commodity?) and anything other product that bears the stamp of
my name, the book's title and the dubious motto that the villain, a
professional Role Model, lives up to in extraordinary ways

Mary,

I think Memory Babe is the best Kerouac biography I've read. I've read other
excellent Kerouac biographies since then, but Memory Babe gave me a sense of
Kerouac as a person that the others haven't given me.

I wasn't mentioned in the biography. Even though my path in Connecticut
overlapped Kerouac's---the girl in the bushes incident near Pratt & Whitney
happened not far from my house in East Hartford and I once attended a party
in an apartment building I think he lived in---he was there four or five
years before I was born, so Nicosia had no reason to include me.

My guess is that you're thinking of Bonnie Frazer, Ray Bremser's wife.

Best,

Vernon

I'm going to teach in Tennessee for one semester, so:



Live/work studio for sublet from January 1 to May 10, $800 a month.

Studio is 1560 square feet:  26' x 60', with 16 foot ceilings and large
double doors

to the outside.



You would get 2 parking spots.

No pets.



Building is located on La Brea, between Slausen and Centinela,

in a nice safe neighborhood.

(short 10 minute drive to UCLA Warner building, LAX, and the beach).

Kitchen is remedial at best and there is no heat.



or,



1/2 the studio could be yours, actually 26' x 25' for work space

only, 24 hours access, at $500 a month.



If you are interested, please e-mail Kristin at ramology@msn.com.

If this were a suicide note, I would leave you my all. You would hear my
voice in it, you would speak me as I have spoken to you, for the last
time, and the words, the words would resonate in familiar tones uniquely
my own. You would hear the silence after the speaking, and you would hear
nothing else, nothing from me, but these words, over and over again. You
might speak, but I would not hear. You might reach out to me, but I would
not be there. I would not have known your new day, or the way you would
read these lines, or even the smallest, simplest word, you might say, upon
their completion. Such sadness, such anger, would not be mine, would not
be of me, would not be anywhere. If this were a suicide note, you would
read the lines and read between them, and even if I explained, you would
look for a clue, for anything, that might give you guidance in these dark
times. And I would not know what you have found, or the truth of it. I
would not know your longing or your speech, or the day after the restless
night, or the day after that. You would read these lines, perhaps, hearing
me ever more distant, losing the accent, the intonation, the last
intonation and the last accent, losing everything of me as time passed, as
you passed as well. What of the next week, the next Thursday, the next
Tuesday, the next 3 a.m. in the morning. What of the page and the paper,
what of my tears perhaps, my despair perhaps, and my voice ever so longing
as you would be longing, fading from the letters, peeled from them. You
might speak, and I would not hear, and you might whisper to yourself, and
I would not be beside you. You might call out my name, and I would be
nowhere, and I would be nowhere and nowhere and nowhere. Perhaps you would
want this note to never end, my voice to never end, but there is the
passing, not of your choosing, but as if it were mine. And you would hear
me, and you would not hear me. And longer, and you would not hear me. And
longer, and there would be so much I would want to say, so that my voice
would once again be lively and just so, just a speaking of something,
perhaps, that we have seen or heard, something we have shared in common,
or that our voices makes commons of us. Perhaps a sigh or even the uncanny
silence of a smile, perhaps the silence still.

speaking of erasures... i write almost exclusively on a pc and all erasures=
 are "virtual" so there's no record of it. this somehow creeps into my writ=
ing but doesn't recontextualize it. or does it? that ghost is truly a ghost=
 in the sense that it only happened to me - the boy who cried wolf so to sp=
eak, without the wolf and without the acknowledged cry. nothing but the 'fi=
nished' text (let's not get into that "is the text ever finished" crap...)

anyway, what was my point?

Allison Croggon shared this article on another listserv regarding the TIPS
program to engage 4% of the USA population as informants as part of Homelan=
d
Security operations! The writer of the article seems a credible source

I am sure many of us - if not all - will find this news frightening and and
a program that must be fought. Indeed, what kind of creative responses or
public education can be initiated to stop a new 'counter-community presence=
'
that might  - in terms of democratic rights - be comparable to the
devastation wrought by the invasion of a computer virus?

Anybody got good ideas for a preventive "patch"?

How to to start a public campaign to neutralize the idea of even becoming a
snitch?

Back to 1950 and got the Joe McCarthy blues again! Oy!

US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies

By=A0Ritt Goldstein=20
July 15 2002=20


The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens
as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.

The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will
have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany
through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum o=
f
4 per cent of Americans to report "suspicious activity".

Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier
this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale
investigations of US citizens.

As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war
against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.

Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are
being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to
homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees,
truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted
recruits.=20

A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov,
is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants
participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the
10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total
population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.

Historically, informant systems have been the tools of non-democratic
states. According to a 1992 report by Harvard University's Project on
Justice, the accuracy of  informant reports is problematic, with some
informants having embellished the truth, and others suspected of having
fabricated their reports.

Present Justice Department procedures mean that informant reports will ente=
r
databases for future reference and/or action. The information will then be
broadly available within the department, related agencies and local police
forces. The targeted individual will remain unaware of  the existence of th=
e
report and of its contents.

The Patriot Act already provides for a person's home to be searched without
that person being informed that a search was ever performed, or of any
surveillance devices that were implanted.

At state and local levels the TIPS program  will be co-ordinated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was given sweeping new powers,
including internment, as part of the Reagan Administration's national
security initiatives. Many key figures of the Reagan era are part of the
Bush Administration.

The creation of a US "shadow government", operating in secret, was another
Reagan national security initiative.

Ritt Goldstein is an investigative journalist and a former leader in the
movement for US law enforcement accountability. He has lived in Sweden sinc=
e
1997, seeking political asylum there, saying he was the victim of
life-threatening assaults in retaliation for his accountability efforts. Hi=
s
application has been supported by the European Parliament, five of Sweden's
seven big political parties, clergy, and Amnesty and other rights groups.

Hi Stephen

I just noticed the date on this article - July 15 2002!

I must have clicked through, I thought it was today's paper.  But anyway,
probably worth following up...

Just read the Sandison one. I have read a great number, but this one
had a slant that seemed even-handed, with a lot of details I had not
seen before. I think that a lot of them came from Carolyn.,

I lost the point - your "explanation" was delightfully confusing - but
speaking of erasures a Alan Loney wrote an interesting poetry book called
"The Erasure Tapes" my felling is that his best book is another called "Side
Tracks" & also "falling".
Alan Loney could be loosely called a NZ language poet ..who is now in
Australia I believe  - but in addition did a lot of publishing and has
number of books out...the word "erasure" reminded me ..perhaps nothing is
erased?

 The words get in and they stay there and they work and they are working and
they do things man they are in there (are YOU in there who's in there?) and
the words the white hot words the words the sigma and the tau the pieces the
masses of things the things get in there and the black and the white and the
red gets get down there and get a hold of them words and those ghosts what
are we gunna do with them ghosts? Lets go down town Brown and  erase some
ghosts man those ghosts those things those creeping and the light we and the
red and the head and the zing and those words inside the words lets go down
town and to see and sing and what are we who are you its great isn't it
those words?  And and what what who who and the words and we get in there
and the words sing and they are like nothing in your head they are the same
different things I love them. Lets get down and erase the town lets get down
into the green and see what they mean lets get into it and lets get
political and lets get serious and crazy serious and speak some words and
lets get going.

speaking of erasures... i write almost exclusively on a pc and all erasures
are "virtual" so there's no record of it. this somehow creeps into my
writing but doesn't recontextualize it. or does it? that ghost is truly a
ghost in the sense that it only happened to me - the boy who cried wolf so
to speak, without the wolf and without the acknowledged cry. nothing but the
'finished' text (let's not get into that "is the text ever finished"
crap...)

anyway, what was my point?

What do you mean its the entire point?  (You nay be right - but I haven't
seen a suffcient "overview of Alan's work to feel I :"know that" - and dont
thus follow what you say... Is there an  **single**  entire point to a
writer's work - ever?  Maybe the point of his work is the the work itself -
the ongoing flux of it - the chrarge - ..of course he's into the"technical
stuff" and the visual aspects  etc and  computer language/ computer
speak/formatting etc  ...but can we be sure of any writer what their "entire
point" is?

Derek:

Given your status as an IT expert, you are no doubt, as you are with the relationship between spam and viruses, familiar with the relationship between discussion lists and trolls.

It seems at least one other list has identified you as a troll, which is exactly what I was thinking when reading your posts here:
http://www.louisrosenfeld.com/home/bloug_archive/000151.html

And here you are, trolling the SIGIA list! I thought I recognized your name from elsewhere!
http://www.info-arch.org/lists/sigia-l/0202/0214.html

This one's a hoot, lecturing people who understand metadata on the relationship between ontologies and (gasp!) Hitler:
http://www.info-arch.org/lists/sigia-l/0311/0059.html

Instead of being nasty, you can always just use your extensive technical skills and filter your email.  That you choose to be a jerk is what makes you a troll.

Richard

I'm having a lot of fun being commodified. Maybe my product line will bring
me income to support my writing. (hahahhaahaha)

If Alan wants to become commodified, I'll be glad to share my selling-out
secrets with him.

Meanwhile, I'll once again assert my belief that Alan Sondheim has the right
to post his work to the List. Those who don't want to read him can read
other posts or press the delete button.

By the way, Alan seems to be singled out for his posting. A number of other
writers have posted their work to the List twice a day, but nobody's
complained about them. I don't have a problem with their posting their work,
either.

But...why does Alan always catch the flak?

Perhaps if more people wore the Vernon Frazer Commercial Fiction thong
($7.99 retail price), their minds would be occupied with matters other than
Alan's posting to the List.

Vernon,

If I were prolific and talented enough to have a volume of work to be
commodified, I'd still want to wear your thong. Think of the inspiration of having
you as a permanent wedgie  throughout the day. It's a new day/way to stay in/on

I think they only come in white. When I move them to Victoria's Secret, I'll

Maybe by 2008 or 2009 we will finally have had enough years of
this controversy to better study the anti/pro Sondheim pattern.

Such questions as:

How many hurricanes enter the Southeast US coast, measured
against both the velocity of the Sondheim attacks and the number
of months between the storm/Sondheim impacts?

What is the psychic influence of Ron Silliman's nicotine levels?
(once he's discovered to be a secret smoker:  Pall Malls, no filters)

How will the Sondheim debate stand up to the soon-to-be-marketed
micro-tampons for tears?  (still awaiting FDA approval)

How will this feud withstand the next diet craze:
sandpaper toilet paper, bringing all big asses into the
fashion industry's slight embrace?

Is there a connection between this Buff List controversy and the
number of times a reporter accidentally refers to The Patriot Act
as The Patriarch Act?

Alas, cafepress.com does not currently make black thongs, and as a
single-order processing company, and reluctant to listen to requests from a
single account (though I suppose it can't hurt to ask, in case they have
many customers asking for black thongs).

It's a rather good company; the clothing tends to be solid, the screen
printing process has vastly improved since 2001 when I first ordered from
them, and the prices are better than you'd expect for single-order
fulfillment. Sadly, though, the market for $8 cotton thongs in black is
probably pretty limited.

In the case of Poetics list customers, though, with a $25 order, I'll send
you a free black paint stick.

Hi folks;
    I am currently transcribing the 1963 Vancouver poetry conference =
(consisting of lectures by Creeley, Duncan, Olson, Ginsberg, Levertov, =
Avison, Whalen) - and part of the process for me is confirming and =
locating all references to poets, poetics and lines of specific poems =
referred to in the lectures. I picture that the final manuscript will =
have a reference for every person, book and quote referred to directly =
or indirectly throughout the lectures. So far the process is going very =
well. I am building on work done by a series of scholars on this =
conference, most specifically Aaron Vidaver, Ralph Maud, Shelley Wong, =
George Butterick and Charles Watts - building on work that has been =
attempted in the past in order to create a manuscript which accurately =
transcribes and annotates all of the extant 13 lectures (roughly 20 =
hours of tape recorded by Fred Wah & currently online at www.slought.net =
) into a single manuscript. I am currently working on the 10th lecture.

That said - I have been trying to locate the following references =
(below) gathered from each of the 10 lectures I have transcribed which =
have proved somewhat elusive to date, and I am hoping that some of you =
might be able to suggest where they might be located. The transcriptions =
below may not be exactly correct as I am working from audio tapes, but =
of course I would like to confirm them as being accurate. Any =
suggestions will be greatly appreciated and acknowledged of course.

Thank you very much for your help and assistance.
Sincerely
derek

have left myself plenty of room to grow. As far as Lou, that's between
Lou and himself, it is his site, and if you look at his site you will
find nothing there to objectively justify his statement -- indeed I only
posted on his blog three times (hardly a stalker in the midst).

Yeah. And that is interesting to me, and I was going to post more on the
subject, but I realized that we don't have a real sample in this instance.
As Patrick posted to the list, and someone else pointed out to me
backchannel, this particular flame-thing is an aberration, not a normal
continuance of the anti-Sondheim saga. But it struck me as curious: drn
almost always faithfully posts two poems a day, and has received one snarky
comment in the time I've been on the list. It was during spring, and the
comment was "Let's hope summer arrives soon. Jesus." I took it as snarky,
anyway, but the author might not have intended it as such.

This is the second time, however, in less than a year on the list that
Alan's been attacked for overexposure, though he posts less than drn. But
this one does appear to be an aberration.

Patrick, i understand you are full of hate (for me) but you may not

reference to back up my words to a cabal on the IA list bent on making
our online content nothing more than pigeon-holed categorical

It seems clearer to say the ownership society is really the "I Got Mine"
society, if we are going to speak plainly now.

Subject:      General Principle of Narrative (Violence) Under Capital
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

General Principle of Narrative (Violence) Under Capital


1. The general principal of narrative under capital is _withholding._

2. In withholding, information, which would propel the narrative forward,
is withheld in order to lengthen, not enrich, the diegetic flow.

3. Within capital, lengthening implies additional penny-dreadful or
feuilleton segments.

4. This is accomplished by suspense, but beneath the 'sign of capital,'
withholding is literally the order of the day.

5. Withholding is accompanied by local omniscience.

6. Example 0: In the book of Job, Yhwh waits until the three friends and
Elihu have finishes their dialogs - at which point, the configuration of
his power is enunciated. Note political economy, enumeration of children,
servants, flocks, etc.

7. Example 1: In Dracula, Van Helsinger leads various people at various
times to Lucy's crypt, demonstrating the corpse is or is not present,
without explaining his belief in her vampirism, which is only revealed
later.

8. Example 2: Almost any television/film: "What happened?" - "I don't have
time to explain. Come with me." - or some such.

9. Example 3: Almost any US newscast? "Why did _x_? - We'll tell you after
the break."

10. Example 4: The US military control of theoretically omniscient
reportage or critique: the "embedded" journalist who becomes an
advertisement for ideology and policy.

11. Example 5: Lyotard's differend returned with a vengeance: The
withholding and withering of entire populations.

12. I don't have time to explain. Come with me. I can't tell you yet. We
don't have any time to lose. You'll see in a while. We can't discuss this.
We can't bring the cops in on this. The authorities would be all over us.
We've got to go it alone. Believe in me. Trust me.

13. The Christology is apparent: Believe, not because it is absurd, but
because of the fury of fast-forward time. Not a moment to lose: Kill the
heathens. Fallujah? No time for the convoys. We've got to move on. We've
got to move in.

14. The withholding promises a completion at _the end of time._ You'll see
in a while. Hold your horses. Dramatic time is time deferred, pornographic
time, differance-time.

15. The time of capital is continuous deferment. Iraq, Iran, Syria, USA,
Belgium, Netherlands, France, Tiero del Fuego. The chain is random,
arbitrary, except for the withholder. The withholder makes it up as it
goes along. The withholder has a grand plan. The withholder is national.
The withholder knows better. Re-elect Bush: We can't change horses in
mid-stream. The driver knows. Withholding is always driven, always the
sublimation and exfoliation, the production of capital.

16. What is withheld is almost always within the differend. What is
withheld no longer speaks, not at all, or speaks only at the end of time.

17. The end of time when the differend speaks: defuge, useless, wastage.
No one listens. The control of news is the control of the imminent, the
explosion of the leading story. The rest is debris.

18. God sets the scene in Job. Gods speaks of the fecundity of the earth.
God ensures his construct. Job is reduced either to silence or
acquiescence. The dialog is over.

19. Withholding has moved from biblical narrative through popular
narrative into the heart of news. It drives narrative forward. It has
eliminated other forms of suspense; the "whodunit" has been replaced by
the unfolding of Armageddon. Look at the Rapture, grown into an Amerikan
industry; look at our Wars themselves. We know whodunit; we watch the
pornography of unfolding, the _pli,_ the baroque which hides the raw
vicissitudes of Power.

20. Omniscience is hidden, parcelling out effect and affect. Omniscience
is the Amerikan lie come true, the lie of capital, planetary corrosion.
The largest life-forms are fungal nets beneath the soil in the upper
Mid-West. The largest life-masses are the single-celled organisms
occupying rock strata beneath the surface of the earth. God waited while
everyone talked. The news promises the answer to the question after the
commercial.

21. The commercial is delivered; the news is the hiatus, the gap. At times
(CNN Headline News for example), the question is not even answered; it is
forgotten in the rush of passing content. "Whatever happened to Baby Jane?
- News at 10." At 10, the news is silent, but the audience is present,
continuing the violating narrative of the planet, what capital allows to
pass for news.

22. "To be distracted by questions of administrative forms, race hatreds,
man hunts, or socialisation of everything but the national debt, is merely
swallowing the sucker-bait." (Ezra Pound, 1953.)

23. The ultimate withholding occurs with the _manhunt_ which is already
foreclosed. The manhunt distracts from the world. The double-withholding:
capital offers the scapegoat; the dead and wounded in Fallujah are
withheld. Withholding occurs in the midst of battle which is never
announced, never enunciated. Withholding creates a _story._ A _story_
promises an _ending._ An _ending_ promises a _suture._ Everything is
returned to normalcy; everything recovers.

24. A _suture_ promises an _ego._ A _suture_ promises a nuclear family. A
_suture_ promises infinity of Power which structures the suture itself.
Such an infinity is Deity. Dissect withholding and Deity always appears.
Withholding is at the beck and call of Fundamentalism, a tool of
Fundamentalism. Withholding promises absolute information, the power of
the Absolute.

25. One withholds because one _knows._ One knows absolutely. The world
divides into the known and unknown. The known is privileged, class.
Withholding is power masquerading as the simulacrum of power.

26. "Trust me. We'll get out of here alive."

Sunday, November 28th
from 3 pm-5 pm
@
Makeready's Gallery 214 Artspace
214 Glenridge Avenue
Montclair

Now more about the workshop from Ken ...

"Come prepared to write. There will be some sort of prompt to start you
up--I'm still sorting through the possibilities. If we have two hours,
about an hour will be spent getting acclimated, then writing. The last
hour will be discussing what you did. It doesn't have to be great, it
doesn't even have to be good, it just needs to happen. The idea is to
think without using your brains--our brains get us into trouble every
time. Mine is my mortal enemy during the first writing phase. Save your
brains for revisions after you leave."

Read recent works by Ken Wolman by visiting
http://www.SpiralBridge.org/home.asp

Help us support the arts and the artists, there is a $10 suggested
donation for this workshop that goes directly to the poet.

to promote community and the arts, we include music in our monthly
program.

We are currently seeking submissions from anyone interested in being
booked to perform. Solo singer/songwriters or a duo that may include
<light> hand percussion, as our event space is absolutely awesome for
this type of performance but not sonically suited to bands.

We have a great space to play (readings are held in an art gallery).
There is a built-in audience (if you can draw, great!... but there is
absolutely no pressure to do so.) It's a wonderful opportunity to build
your mailing list with a listening crowd.

Please email with any questions and for mailing address for press kits.
Inquiries welcomed.

Packets should include CD, bio, and contact information. CD should
reflect your solo or duo sound, not full band. Think MTV:Unplugged.

Lynn Rosenthal

Amy King and I are talking on the phone, and we are talking about the
fragmentation that seems to be happening on this listserv--so
reflective--mirror of the Democratic party.

How we can combat (ha ha) this fragmentation?

Wasn't the spirit of this listserv (merry christmas) one of sharing and
supporting each other in the business of poetry?

Why can't there be poetry mobs?  We've got this great tool (listserv)
already organized ....

              exhibition Nov. 19th

Baumgartner Gallery is pleased to announce its inaugural exhibition at
the new 522 West 24th Street location, presenting a selection of John
Cage’s celebrated New River Watercolors and George Quasha’s new Axial
Stones & Drawings.  Opening November 19, 2004  6-8 PM

Revolutionary composer, poet/writer, and artist, John Cage made a series
of watercolors in 1988 at the Mountain Lake Workshop in Virginia; he
used stones from New River, which were arranged systematically with art
materials (colors, papers, brushes & feathers, etc.) and employed
according to I Ching-based chance operations. These visual works
represent a high point in Cage’s famous displacement of “choice” from
the level of taste, personal emotion, and aesthetic judgment to that of
a non-personalist modality of engaging materials and process. “My
choices,” he said “consist in choosing what questions to ask.”  The work
on paper preserves the traces of an event, an energy field of material
expression, where things speak for themselves in unforeseen ways and
retain their freshness year after year.

In his mid 20s George Quasha met John Cage and felt his own work as poet
and artist “reoriented,” although he himself never embraced systematic
chance operations.  (Later his Station Hill Press published Cage’s
Themes & Variations.)  Quasha’s sense of the axial, as the principle
pervading all of his work (whether sculpture, drawing, video, language,
or performance), offers a parallel to Cage’s intention to discover
uniqueness and radical newness in each instance of composition, whatever
the medium.

Quasha’s axial stones are the result of subtle attractions and unique
acts of balance.  He discovers individual stones, usually in or near
rivers, and, according to the artist, “waits (minutes, days, years)
until they discover each other”; he then “performs their act of union
through radical balance, without changing the stones in any way and
without any kind of stickum.”  He “works them, on an invisible axis,
toward their most precarious point, the optimal statement of apparent
impossibility”; this is the point where “a stone seems on the verge of
switching elements, a liminality of earth and air.”   They “remain on
edge, pre-climactic, impermanent, yet well seated in their perilous
retention.”

The axial drawings present a related event in the medium of graphite on
paper.  “The axial does not suggest a method or style but a principle,
which, unlike the conceptual, can have no definitive expression; instead
it generates ever new instances of itself.”  A “state of free moving
intentionality, it finds formal integrity on the fly.” Despite a
sometimes surprising elegance in the drawing, it is in fact an
unrepeatable event — a skill-defying act that restores the artist to
“zero point” — a momentary innocence rather than mastery.  What appears
is an “integrating energy” that is neither abstract nor figurative, but
configurative — “a site of possible figuration with no hold on formal
consistency.”  Axial drawing here means “graphite exciting paper to open
its aperture to an other side.”


beauty = precarious x optimal

George Quasha’s work in installation and video includes "art is:
Speaking Portraits (in the performative indicative)", an ongoing project
on exhibit this month at White Box, November 16 through 27 (525 West
26th Street); at the same time it will be streamed on WPS1, the all-art
internet station of PS1/MoMA.  (Details of the work at
www.artis-online.net.)   art is has previously been exhibited at the
Snite Museum of Art, the International Media Art  Biennale WRO 03
(Wroclaw), 10th Biennial of Moving Images (Saint-Gervais, Geneva),
Bunkier Sztuki (Krakow), World Social Forum 04 (Bombay), etc.  His
thirteen books include: art writing (four books and nine catalogues on
artist Gary Hill, including Tall Ships, HanD HearD/liminal objects,
Viewer, and Language Willing),  poetry (five books, including Ainu
Dreams and The Preverbs of Tell), and anthologies  (America a Prophecy,
Open Poetry, and The Station Hill Blanchot Reader). He continues his
twenty year performance and video/language collaboration with Gary Hill
and Charles Stein.

Raymond claimed his software was recognizing Alan's posts as a virus +

An "HTML-resolving URL" is a URL which resolves to a hyper-text document
(a .html extension) and not to an image (ie. a .png extension).
HyperText documents have the advantage of being Mark-up Languages --
which means you can do all kinds of crazy stuff with them on your server
and the list only needs to see one single URL. This is how the web
works. Many people publicize their blogs and other activities on po-list
in this unobtrusive and reasonable way. At some simple point it is just
stupid not to ask someone to stop yelling in your ear.

I'm asking Alan if it is necessary to post his work daily here while
pointing out he his overexposed on this list. Yes, this is a question.
Can Alan Sondheim exist outside of this po-list? Does he dare try
something new?

<<<Amy King and I are talking on the phone, and we are talking about the
fragmentation that seems to be happening on this listserv--so
reflective--mirror of the Democratic party.>>>>

Minky, I'm not certain which fragmentation in particular you are
referring to.  It seems that there is a shared (for the most part)
political vibe here, but as far as poetry, is it really the best thing
to ask for unity from poets when it comes to poetry?

There is nothing wrong with poets disagreeing, in fact, as a
group, poets seem to be very disagreeable, and that could be
seen as a valuable tool in this world where so much is asked
of people, and passively agreed upon.

In Germany they are entrenched in a national fight for and
against extending the working week to 40 hours.  It's so
exciting to see such angry people, insisting that 40 hours
is simply too traumatic for the human body to endure.
Meanwhile, in America, MOST people work 40 to 50 hours
a week, and have recently given up overtime pay.

In an age of brand name, centralized intelligence, it's the
disagreeable who are needed.  Those who can say NO
when they fucking mean it!  Or Fuck Off, or whatever.

Conflict is healthy, especially in the understanding and
definition of poetics.  The different groups --or fragments
as you call them-- are formed with shared vitality, and it's
got nothing to do with comparisons to political parties.

Just because the election happened so recently, we don't
need to be comparing every group to a political party.  It's
one thing for poets to be political, another for a poet to be
a politician.  Unity in some ways is far more destructive than
it is anything else.

Being disagreeable can be supportive, in that it forces each
poet to be confronted with whether or not they really believe
what it is they say.  And if so, well then they can defend
their argument.

Asking poets to come together for a fuzzy hug is missing the
point about HOW supportive taking a stand can turn out to be.

If you buy the thong and wear it while swimming, you'll have something close
to a diphthong. Since I'm only the object of commodification, I don't have
the authority or access to customize the product. If you buy one and send it
to me with return postage, I'll be glad to write "diph" on the thong and
autograph it for you.

Dear Mr. Frazer,

It has come to our attention that you have offered to modify one of our
products for a customer, on the grounds that said customer wanted to be
different. We must ask that you cease and desist this action immediately. As
you know, as a commercial writer, your job is to sell our products, and
while your book at http://www.unlikelystories.org/frazer0604.shtml is one of
our products, it is not the primary source of income your commercialism
represents. Our product line, and the style represented thereby, is an
important part of our company's image, and you are not authorized to tamper
or modify that image in any way. We have not yet been successful in
prosecuting all incidents of the tampering of our image that
http://www.unlikelystories.org/frazer0604.shtml represents, but in time, we
will. We expect you to retract your offer without necessitating action
against you, action we are fully prepared to take.

Sincerely,

This is right - agreement can be fatal - harmony deceptive.

[(by the way I have always been a supporter of Alan Sondheim's work (since I
can on the list a few years ago) so I hope people didnt misread my tongue in
cheek comments about Alan as (me) not wanting him on the List - he is doing
some amazing if baffling stuff and the sheer amount of is a phenomenom - so
much so Sondheimia is certain to be studied by generations of Phd students
to come ( I envisage a huge musem called The Sondheimian Excessivist
Postivistic Ontachocalogical Cybermania Non-Centre Institute - containing
approx 100,000,000,000,000 billion billion cyber books of Sondheimia) (just
jiving - but seriously - some strange but interesting work by Alan.....I
despair of ever understanding a fraction of it but love the idea of it... )]

  Human groups need to conflict to grow.

 re the US elections etc (and frag)
- of course there is a lot of serious shit going down there but we are also
poets -not politicians (or everyone is a politician) - we are all part of
the human tribes -  community - and no matter how hermetic we may be
individually -and with various degress of introversion/exxtrovesion - we
each need each other...but fragmentation is interesting and probably
necessary as probably wars and conflict are right now. The miltant (and
other) left shouldn't fear war or conflict - ultimately there needs to be a
revolutionary war/wars (but the idealogical/sociological/philosphical "wars"
(fragmentaions)are just as immportant - it may get down to an actual
revolutionary war -  riots etc - but cant see that coming for along time -
the riots and protest maybe soner athn we thingk though: but those
possibilites shouldn't be feared, nor should the 'future' (or everyone will
collapse in bundles of shrieking neunronic nets) - dangerous as these guys
(The New [wold be] Rulers of the World) are (with Wolfowitz being replaced
by another semi-psychopath ( is it Morales or Gonzales?) cited as
encouraging imprisonment of so-called terrorists without the usual legal
rights)) and their anti-terrorist laws moving (they are in law here) to NZ -
very much the same laws as The Homeland Security Laws are in force here even
in NZ and also Australia) but translate those laws as -  "anti -people =
keep people scared , easier to manipulate." (1984 by Orwell is the relevant
text) - dangerous as they are they stuff up.  The "proposed" 10 million
spies is another problem (that starts to look very much like Nazi
Germany)..but despite everything the ruling class will fail - eventually
they will go too far - invade Iran and Syria and then maybe try for China -
or even before that and we will have a very big protest movement worldwide -
the Imperialists will also (sooner or later) be beaten miltarily by
gurerilla warfare.

So - to reapeat disagreement is what we are all about as Conrad implies -
the struggles in Germany are good. But I dont want to agree too much with
Conrad!!..lol..... And we are not disagreeing very much anyway (perhaps not
fragmenting eboough - lol) - Harry Nudel states his views..Alan pours on his
work...which has a lot of politcal content in it...others give political
links etc etc Others simply send poetry or poetics. Nobody neccesarily
agrees. Or we all (poetically?) dissagree on somethings if not everything...

Good grief, no one is dissing disagreement.  It's a necessity that's with us
always, hence Minky's playful use of the term "combat."  However, this list
perpetually regresses into ongoing "disagreements" that sit solely on the
pinhead of whose "turf" the listserv is.

Even now, Minky's main sentiment is disregarded, one that suggests,  yes, a
kind of silly playfulness but also (albeit simplistic) a call to do
something together and be supportive of and in the tiny world that is
poetry.  In fact, this kind of call actually supports the idea of members
posting their work and is not anti-any-listserv member!  Why is it that you
have only read that we are calling for an end to disagreement?  A call for
"solidarity" a la Rodney King?  Why has it been decided that we are against
defending our values via protest?

Isn't it just possible that two women on the phone across the state from
each other, giddy at midnight, thought it might be fun to propose that poets
do something fun together and in unison (--at the same time-- not unlike the
flashmob phenomena) even if most of us are separated by distance?   Does "in
unison" mean we will all suddenly agree on every political and moral count
and even do the same exact thing at the same time?  Must doing poetry
"together" be relegated to events focused on readings or blogs where a
select few are central?  Please don't read that I'm opposed to readings and
blogs - I'm not.

Wouldn't it be nice to find yourself in Grand Central Station during rush
hour at precisely 5:30 p.m. in the middle of a group of poets holding an
impromptu reading (logistics not withstanding)?  Wouldn't it be wonderful if
we all sent poems simultaneously to one online media site and made them
pause (& possibly respond) in the name of poetry?  Poets read poetry, they
say.  Many poets venture into other realms and bring attention to poetry.
Many people are doing wonderful work when it comes to drawing attention to
poetry outside of our somewhat insular world.  Aren't there any lurkers
interested in sharing their ideas in this regard?  And again, I'll qualify
this to avoid misinterpretations:  I am not saying the goal of poetry should
be to appeal to the masses.

It's early, and I am sans-coffee.  Clearly these ideas are rudimentary & can
be much more constructive and are, of course, to be disregarded by the
masses - but please do not mistake our sentiment as some misguided call for
a new obtuse anti-political hearts-and-hugs religion.  We too know conflict.

I'll be posting a poem at noon.    I hope others do too.

CA Conrad--your words below are valuable--but have you missed my point?

I hardly need to be outlined the benefits of complicating ones thinking
through disagreement and inquiry. I'm 35, overeducated, and
underimpressed with rhetoric that does not move humans, my students
included, to question ideas.

In the spirt of not flaming, I don't want a hug, I want poetry.

I hope this listserv sees some poetry at noon. Or we hear it in the
streets.

<<<Amy King and I are talking on the phone, and we are talking about the
fragmentation that seems to be happening on this listserv--so

Minky, I'm not certain which fragmentation in particular you are
referring to.  It seems that there is a shared (for the most part)
political vibe here, but as far as poetry, is it really the best thing
to ask for unity from poets when it comes to poetry?

There is nothing wrong with poets disagreeing, in fact, as a
group, poets seem to be very disagreeable, and that could be
seen as a valuable tool in this world where so much is asked
of people, and passively agreed upon.

In Germany they are entrenched in a national fight for and
against extending the working week to 40 hours.  It's so
exciting to see such angry people, insisting that 40 hours
is simply too traumatic for the human body to endure.
Meanwhile, in America, MOST people work 40 to 50 hours
a week, and have recently given up overtime pay.

In an age of brand name, centralized intelligence, it's the
disagreeable who are needed.  Those who can say NO
when they fucking mean it!  Or Fuck Off, or whatever.

Conflict is healthy, especially in the understanding and
definition of poetics.  The different groups --or fragments
as you call them-- are formed with shared vitality, and it's
got nothing to do with comparisons to political parties.

Just because the election happened so recently, we don't
need to be comparing every group to a political party.  It's
one thing for poets to be political, another for a poet to be
a politician.  Unity in some ways is far more destructive than
it is anything else.

Being disagreeable can be supportive, in that it forces each
poet to be confronted with whether or not they really believe
what it is they say.  And if so, well then they can defend
their argument.

Asking poets to come together for a fuzzy hug is missing the
point about HOW supportive taking a stand can turn out to be.

Amy King and I are talking on the phone, and we are talking about the
fragmentation that seems to be happening on this listserv--so
reflective--mirror of the Democratic party.

How we can combat (ha ha) this fragmentation?

Wasn't the spirit of this listserv (merry christmas) one of sharing and
supporting each other in the business of poetry?

Why can't there be poetry mobs?  We've got this great tool (listserv)
already organized ....

Rapper O.D.B. Collapses, Dies in Studio

By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY, AP Music Writer
http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~78~2534135,00.html

NEW YORK - The rap artist O.D.B., whose utterly unique rhymes, wild
lifestyle and incessant legal troubles made him one of the most vivid
characters in hip-hop, collapsed and died inside a recording studio
Saturday. He was 35.

O.D.B. had complained of chest pains before collapsing at the Manhattan
studio, and was dead by the time paramedics arrived, said Gabe Tesoriero, a
spokesman for O.D.B.'s record label, Roc-a-Fella.

The cause of death was not immediately clear, but O.D.B. had recently
finished a prison sentence for drug possession and escaping a rehab clinic.
He would have turned 36 on Monday.

O.D.B., also known as â€˜Ol' Dirty Bastard, Dirt McGirt, Big Baby Jesus
or his
legal name of Russell Jones was a founding member of the seminal rap group
the Wu-Tang Clan in the early 1990s. With his unorthodox delivery Ã¢â‚¬â€
alternately slurred, hyper and nonsensical O.D.B. stood out even in the
nine-man Clan, which featured such future stars as Method Man, RZA and Ghost
face Killah.

The Wu-Tang blueprint was for each member to pursue solo projects, and
O.D.B.'s were among the best. He released hit singles such as "Shimmy Shimmy
Ya" and "Got Your Money," and appeared on remixes with artists like Mariah
Carey.

"There's nobody like him in the game," RZA told The Associated Press in an
April interview, when asked if O.D.B. could resume his career after prison.
"He's got a lot of problems he's got to iron out, of course, but as far as a
one-of-a-kind person, a one-of-a-kind artist, he's one of a generation, one
of a lifetime. He's a very rare commodity."

But as his fame increased, so did his erratic behavior, and fans came to
expect the unexpected from O.D.B.

When MTV News followed him around at the height of his popularity, he took
the camera crew and several of his kids (he was said to have more than a
dozen, by numerous mothers) to the welfare office in a limousine to get an
allotment of food stamps.

And he received them.

In February 1998, he crashed the stage at the Grammy Awards and hijacked a
microphone from singer Shawn Colvin as she accepted an award, apparently
upset over losing the best rap album Grammy to P. Diddy (then known as Puff
Daddy. He complained that he spent a lot of money for new clothes because he
thought he was going to win. The rapper later apologized.

Over the years, he was wounded in shootings and arrested on a veritable
laundry list of charges, including menacing security officers, illegally
possessing body armor, driving with a suspended license, shoplifting and
threatening a former girlfriend.

In 2000, after escaping a court-ordered stint in a California rehabilitation
center, authorities searched for him for a month. He was finally arrested in
Philadelphia three days after performing in a New York City concert with his
Wu-Tang clique.

He was sentenced in 2001 to two to four years in prison for drug possession,
plus two concurrent years for escaping from the clinic. He was released in
2003 and immediately signed with Roc-a-Fella.

He heralded his return with a news conference alongside singer Carey pop
fans may know him best for his memorable cameo on her hit "Fantasy,"
featuring rhymes like "me and Mariah, go back like babies with pacifiers."

Tesoriero said O.D.B. had been working on his comeback album for more than a
year and was almost finished.

"Russell inspired all of us with his spirit, wit, and tremendous heart,"
Roc-A-Fella founder Damon Dash said in a statement. "The world has lost a
great talent, but we mourn the loss of our friend."

His mother, Cherry Jones, said she received the news of her son's death in a
phone call, which she called "every mother's worst dream."

"To the public he was known as Old Dirty Bastard, but to me he was known as
Rusty. The kindest most generous soul on earth," her statement said.
"Russell was more than a rapper, he was a loving father, brother, uncle, and
most of all, son."

Geoffrey Dyer & Eileen Tabios

Join us to hear from two local latter-day prose poets. According to the Poetry
Project Newsletter, Oaklander Geoffrey Dyerùs debut, The Dirty Halo of
Everything "unfolds a musical dream world, where travel logs, late night
talks, and enigmatic characters are taken through a philosophically spiritual
sense of interconnection." Eileen Tabios' books include Reproductions of the
Empty Flagpole, Behind the Blue Canvas, and the just-published Menage a Trois
with the 21st Century, which Kevin Killian says "moves from melting prose
poetry to a fully lineated, musical demand for action...you will find yourself
asking 'where is the world that is waiting to happen?'"



& coming up:
Thursday, December 2 at 7 PM
JALAL TOUFIC



Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT
members, and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &

Subject: General Principle of Narrative (Violence) Under Capital

General Principle of Narrative (Violence) Under Capital


1. The general principal of narrative under capital is _withholding._

2. In withholding, information, which would propel the narrative forward,
is withheld in order to lengthen, not enrich, the diegetic flow.

3. Within capital, lengthening implies additional penny-dreadful or
feuilleton segments.

4. This is accomplished by suspense, but beneath the 'sign of capital,'
withholding is literally the order of the day.

5. Withholding is accompanied by local omniscience.

6. Example 0: In the book of Job, Yhwh waits until the three friends and
Elihu have finishes their dialogs - at which point, the configuration of
his power is enunciated. Note political economy, enumeration of children,
servants, flocks, etc.

7. Example 1: In Dracula, Van Helsinger leads various people at various
times to Lucy's crypt, demonstrating the corpse is or is not present,
without explaining his belief in her vampirism, which is only revealed
later.

8. Example 2: Almost any television/film: "What happened?" - "I don't have
time to explain. Come with me." - or some such.

9. Example 3: Almost any US newscast? "Why did _x_? - We'll tell you after
the break."

10. Example 4: The US military control of theoretically omniscient
reportage or critique: the "embedded" journalist who becomes an
advertisement for ideology and policy.

11. Example 5: Lyotard's differend returned with a vengeance: The
withholding and withering of entire populations.

12. I don't have time to explain. Come with me. I can't tell you yet. We
don't have any time to lose. You'll see in a while. We can't discuss this.
We can't bring the cops in on this. The authorities would be all over us.
We've got to go it alone. Believe in me. Trust me.

13. The Christology is apparent: Believe, not because it is absurd, but
because of the fury of fast-forward time. Not a moment to lose: Kill the
heathens. Fallujah? No time for the convoys. We've got to move on. We've
got to move in.

14. The withholding promises a completion at _the end of time._ You'll see
in a while. Hold your horses. Dramatic time is time deferred, pornographic
time, differance-time.

15. The time of capital is continuous deferment. Iraq, Iran, Syria, USA,
Belgium, Netherlands, France, Tiero del Fuego. The chain is random,
arbitrary, except for the withholder. The withholder makes it up as it
goes along. The withholder has a grand plan. The withholder is national.
The withholder knows better. Re-elect Bush: We can't change horses in
mid-stream. The driver knows. Withholding is always driven, always the
sublimation and exfoliation, the production of capital.

16. What is withheld is almost always within the differend. What is
withheld no longer speaks, not at all, or speaks only at the end of time.

17. The end of time when the differend speaks: defuge, useless, wastage.
No one listens. The control of news is the control of the imminent, the
explosion of the leading story. The rest is debris.

18. God sets the scene in Job. Gods speaks of the fecundity of the earth.
God ensures his construct. Job is reduced either to silence or
acquiescence. The dialog is over.

19. Withholding has moved from biblical narrative through popular
narrative into the heart of news. It drives narrative forward. It has
eliminated other forms of suspense; the "whodunit" has been replaced by
the unfolding of Armageddon. Look at the Rapture, grown into an Amerikan
industry; look at our Wars themselves. We know whodunit; we watch the
pornography of unfolding, the _pli,_ the baroque which hides the raw
vicissitudes of Power.

20. Omniscience is hidden, parcelling out effect and affect. Omniscience
is the Amerikan lie come true, the lie of capital, planetary corrosion.
The largest life-forms are fungal nets beneath the soil in the upper
Mid-West. The largest life-masses are the single-celled organisms
occupying rock strata beneath the surface of the earth. God waited while
everyone talked. The news promises the answer to the question after the
commercial.

21. The commercial is delivered; the news is the hiatus, the gap. At times
(CNN Headline News for example), the question is not even answered; it is
forgotten in the rush of passing content. "Whatever happened to Baby Jane?
- News at 10." At 10, the news is silent, but the audience is present,
continuing the violating narrative of the planet, what capital allows to
pass for news.

22. "To be distracted by questions of administrative forms, race hatreds,
man hunts, or socialisation of everything but the national debt, is merely
swallowing the sucker-bait." (Ezra Pound, 1953.)

23. The ultimate withholding occurs with the _manhunt_ which is already
foreclosed. The manhunt distracts from the world. The double-withholding:
capital offers the scapegoat; the dead and wounded in Fallujah are
withheld. Withholding occurs in the midst of battle which is never
announced, never enunciated. Withholding creates a _story._ A _story_
promises an _ending._ An _ending_ promises a _suture._ Everything is
returned to normalcy; everything recovers.

24. A _suture_ promises an _ego._ A _suture_ promises a nuclear family. A
_suture_ promises infinity of Power which structures the suture itself.
Such an infinity is Deity. Dissect withholding and Deity always appears.
Withholding is at the beck and call of Fundamentalism, a tool of
Fundamentalism. Withholding promises absolute information, the power of
the Absolute.

25. One withholds because one _knows._ One knows absolutely. The world
divides into the known and unknown. The known is privileged, class.
Withholding is power masquerading as the simulacrum of power.

26. "Trust me. We'll get out of here alive."

Smashing glasses, screaming verbal, abuse its no use, theres no excuse
Come on Missus, save me a draw, but she dont share, shes a greedy broad.

Get your hand off my drink mullet girl

Dear Subscribers,


Please don't be surprise by my letter since there is
no formal introduction. I promised not to post in the
voyeurism. I am ready like a cop.

I walked right up to the Mark E Smith. Said I was
looking to score in the noise scene.

I miss those frail, honest lines that trail off too
late.

Do you?

I harnessed, quite ingeniously, your ears with my
life.

Only, really, I didn’t!

>>&#8800;&#960;&#8734;Û¶—¡Û¶b•Œ¿\Æ…&#8706;°´o§@&#8800;”´»§H§]®S¶&#8805;°C¡ŸØ‡¶&#8805;&#8719;ÚßA§@&#8734;_&#8747;&#8710;™&#8747;™B§Õ&#8706;‹?


I'm sorry I cannot read the Chinese in the emails you
sent me. But I
have watched the music video and looked at the
picture.

>>Ok , I will waiting for your phone call.

or, conversely, as soon as i deduce that everything i
try turns to shit and decide to stay in XXXXXXXX
forever, i'll just give you her email and you can
masquerade as the friend the sexiest smell you've ever
had on you fingers is your own piss. why don't you
fuck off to a chatroom and stop wasting our time. Some
people like Greil Marcus, cannot handle all of my
amplitude, while clearly YOU can.


Back Demons! Hwa-cha!

You can see my impression of Raymond Carver has failed
miserably.

COITUS INTERRUPTUS

Naked at the window, my wife calls me
as if someone is dying, and someone
almost is, pinned to the concrete face down
beneath the fists and feet and knees of three

policemen. I'm still hard from before she
jumped out of bed to answer the question
I was willing not to ask when the siren
stopped on our block, but now I'm here, and I see

the man is Black, and how can I not
bear witness? They've cuffed him,
but the uniforms continue to crowd our street,
and the blue-and-whites keep coming,

as if called to war, as if the lives
in all these darkened homes
were truly at stake, and that's the thing-
who can tell from up here?-maybe

we're watching our salvation
without knowing it. Above our heads,
a voice calls out "Fucking pigs!"
but the ones who didn't drag the man

into a waiting car and drive off
refuse the bait. They talk quietly,
gathered beneath the streetlamp
in the pale circle of light

the man was beaten in, and then
a word we cannot hear is given
and the cops wave each other back
to their vehicles, the flash and sparkle

of their driving off
throwing onto the wall of our room
a shadow of the embrace
my wife and I have been clinging to.

When I was sixteen, Tommy, who was white,
brought to my room before he left
the Simon and Garfunkel tape
I'd put back among his things

the previous night. He placed it
on the bookshelf near the door
he'd slammed in my face two days earlier
when he was holding a butcher's cleaver

to my mother's life. I wanted
to run after him and smash it at his feet;
I wanted to grab him by the scruff of the neck
and crush it in his face, to dangle him

over the side of our building with one
ankle in my left hand and the Greatest Hits
in my right and ask him
which I should let drop.

But I didn't, couldn't really:
he was much too big,
and I was not a fighter.
The eight track sat on the shelf for weeks,

and there were days when I forgot it was there,
and days when I chose to forget,
and days when I picked it up, pressing
a spider web of cracks into the plastic,

but I always put the music down.
I told myself I liked the songs
more than I hated Tommy,
but I knew I was lying,

just as, behind these thoughts, I know
one of my best friends has chosen
to stay with her son in the house
where her husband has already hit her

once with a cast iron frying pan
and once with his hands,
and so there is no reason to believe
she is not at this moment cringing

bruised and bleeding in a corner
of their bedroom, or that she is not,
with her boy and nothing else in her arms,
running the way my mother

didn't have a chance to run,
and there's nothing I can do
but look at the clock-Sunday,
11:11 PM-and remind myself

it's too late to call, that my calls
have caused trouble for her already.
When I called the cops to get Tommy
out of our home, the deep male voice,

calm authority on the other end,
asked "Son, are you sure your mom's in there
against her will?" Somehow-the words are gone from me-
I gave him the more-than-yes he needed

and two hours later they pushed Tommy in handcuffs
out the front door, past where my mother sat,
head in hands, quiet, unmoving, and I did not know
from where inside my own rage and terror

to pull the comfort I should have offered her.
The officer making sure Tommy
didn't trip or run, winked at me, smiling
as if what had happened were suddenly

a secret between us, and this our signal
that everything was okay. I remember
the night of my sophomore year,
walking the road girdling the campus:

Up ahead, a woman's voice pleading
a man's shouting to stop. A car door
slamming, engine revving, and then wheels
digging hard and fast into driveway dirt

that when I got there was a dust cloud
obscuring the blue vehicle's rear plate.
The woman sprawled on the asphalt,
her black dress spread around her

like a portal her wrapped-in-a-white-shawl
upper body emerged from. I extended
my hand to help her up, but she pulled
the cloth away from her feet,

which were bleeding. I drove her-
she sat next to me without speaking,
staring straight ahead-to where
her shoes had fallen off,

spaghetti strap sandals torn and twisted
beyond repair, and then to her home,
two rooms in a neighborhood house.
After I settled her onto the bed

that was her only furniture, and filled
a warm-water basin to soak her feet,
and he had not hit her, so there was nothing
to report, she said she was afraid

and would I sit with her a while.
We talked about her home in Seoul,
the man her parents picked for her,
but she didn't want a Korean husband,

and here she laughed-first trickle
of spring water down a winter mountain-
"So instead I take from Egypt! I so stupid!"
Then: "What you think? Can man and woman

sleep same bed without sex?" I said yes.
"So, please, tonight, you stay here? Maybe he coming back.
He fear white American like you." I was not a fighter,
but I stayed, and in the morning when I left,

she said "kamsahamnida"-thank you-
and she bowed low, and she did not
ask my name, nor I hers, and though
I sometimes looked for her on campus,

I never saw her again. Just like Tommy.
Just like the Black woman who lived downstairs
before I got married, whose cries-"Help!
Please! He's killing me!"-and the dead thud

of him, also Black, throwing her
against the wall, and his screaming-
"Shut up, bitch! Fucking whore!"-filled the space
till I was drowning. The desk sergeant

didn't ask if I knew beyond a doubt
that she was being beaten,
but when she opened her front door
to the two men he sent, she shrieked

the way women shriek
in bad horror movies
when they know they're going to die,
and I almost felt sorry for calling.

A few weeks later, a voice on the phone:
"You know what's going on below you, right?
Please, tape a message to the door: 'Mr. Peters
has been trying to reach you.' Nothing else.

And whatever you do, don't sign it."
For a month all was quiet. Then,
coming home early from work
I walked upstairs past people moving furniture

out of her apartment. "No one ever
wants to get involved, right?" a thin white man
in shorts and a t-shirt whispered bitter
behind me. I kept walking

the way Tommy did when he saw me
trying to catch his eye: head down,
gaze nailed to the floor, and then he was gone,
and the questions I wanted to ask him

never became words. That tape
was all I had, till one day,
cleaning house, my mother
held it up:

"Do you still want this?"

"I never play it."

"Throw it out then."

So I did.

The Save-Your-Soul Soapboxers

Gospel-shouters with microphones,
each day ruining the pleasure of
brown-bag or vendor-bought lunch
on the steps of
Manhattan's 42nd Street library.

The ever-patient exquisite stone
lions are biding their time--
the fierce day will come
they'll stir and loose
their soul-thrilling rebuttal.

we made the first month - Bethel

too sweet was the nectar
too drunk on our power
     we came then we conquered
          and rained fire down
               upon our own heads

and after the stones
     had fallen from heaven
after the long night
     when life began greening
we picked up the god stones
     and hid them in boxes
     forgetting we made
     both the ark and the stones

the birch tree and roebuck
the bethel and baetyl
were made in agreement
     a simple beginning
we just can't remember

we are the architects
we are the home
we are agreement
     in flesh and bone

in the black of the night
in the white of the sun
     we're only and infinite
     we're each just one

as an early birch tree
     or stones fallen from heaven
they call us to remember
     our hunger is leaven

Bad traffic and lateness for class and my car-written
piece (Minky's follows since she posted twice):


No Shadow At High Noon

I have seen skies as blue as diamonds,
lakes as deep as some rivers tarry,
hands murmuring in rhythm to god,
hair fly off of heads at the drop of a hat,
and a red purse on the arm of a friend.
My own sleeves are often missing in action,
and I can’t recall which sentence invites
conjugal visits when everyone wants a story.
This listserv has brought many pens
to the brink and made many fingers
motionless, but I’ve never seen poems
as lovely as the ones you profess today





And Minky's:


Sidereal

1.

at 8 in the morning there is a man
standing at the foot of a building
he looks as if he’s ready to serenade
but no those days are over
she’s finally given him the boot
last night at the karaoke bar
he had moved so well to Aretha
everyone had begun to dance
even the tortillas and the chips
well maybe his eyes lingered too long
on the back of someone else’s body
but she had never cared so much before
he’s standing below her window now
without a key, throwing rocks.

2.

you could make the story different.
let’s say the tractor could make it all
the way back. or the fishing line could
reach that far. you could be without
aspirations! you could eat less vegetables!
you could make the story different!

the fish walked up to the farmer
and noticed his mole.
the farmer was a mirror.
the mirror was a tractor.
the fishing line drug the tractor.

that’s how she got away.

My Dear Mr. Penton:

I must take exception to your public reprimand.

I would think your organization would appreciate my efforts to assist in the
promotion of the merchandise in the Vernon Frazer product line. It seemed
perfectly appropriate to offer Mr. Kehir personal service to show that I, as
author and commodity, stand behind my product, on those rare occasions when
I am not actually wearing it. If, for example, Mr. Kehir wanted to wear a
diphthong to impress prospective lovers at his nearest pool, it seemed good
business to offer him assistance. My extra effort might, for example, have
inspired him to buy the Commercial Fiction Lunchbox. Good customer service
generates business, as you should well know.

Moreover, your reprimand contradicts your previous actions. In a recent post
to this list, you recently offered list members a black pen for a $25
purchase of Vernon Frazer products. In the context, one could safely assume
they were thongs.

I fail to understand why you can promote my product, but I cannot.
Apparently you have forgotten that, regardless of our contractual
arrangements, I am my own commodity.

I will, however, and with utmost reluctance, withdraw my offer to promote
the Vernon Frazer product line to Mr. Kehir. I assume, however, that you
will make every effort to provide him the personalized customer service
which I had intended to offer him, along with my sincerest apologies.

Should you persist in treating me as a mere commodity, I will have no choice
but to invite you to the Fifth Street Gym on your next visit to Miami.

Yours (by contractual arrangement only),


Vernon Frazer, Commodity

Dear Mr. Frazer,

It has come to our attention that you have offered to modify one of our
products for a customer, on the grounds that said customer wanted to be
different. We must ask that you cease and desist this action immediately. As
you know, as a commercial writer, your job is to sell our products, and
while your book at http://www.unlikelystories.org/frazer0604.shtml is one of
our products, it is not the primary source of income your commercialism
represents. Our product line, and the style represented thereby, is an
important part of our company's image, and you are not authorized to tamper
or modify that image in any way. We have not yet been successful in
prosecuting all incidents of the tampering of our image that
http://www.unlikelystories.org/frazer0604.shtml represents, but in time, we
will. We expect you to retract your offer without necessitating action
against you, action we are fully prepared to take.

Sincerely,

I'm sorry, but I can't agree. Disagreement is just something I can't go
along with.

WORKSHOPS

Starting This Week

The Art of Transformation
Instructors:  Jimmie Gilliam and Laurie Dean Torrell
3 Tuesdays, 11/16, 11/23, and 11/30 from 6:30-8:30
In The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo
$90, $75 for members

Transformations offer an opportunity to enlarge imagination and expand the
sense of what is possible in both life and artistic work. Beginning again -
suspending judgement, re-framing the familiar, being willing to change
direction - these artistic practices can be employed to navigate times of
change, and can be used to create new work.  In this workshop we will mine
experience, and use the texts The Art of Possibility: Transforming
Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander,
and Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go by Shaun McNiff.
Through discussion and writing exercises we will explore the subject of
transformation.  Participants will have the opportunity to create and share
original essays and poems, and within the three-week period, receive
individual critique if desired.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

For more information, or to register, call 832-5400 or download the
registration form from our website at www.justbuffalo.org

I think that if you look closer you will notice that drn began his
series in 'Late Spring' and if you observe his subject titles you can
assume his series has a point, a direction, a season even, and aims at
moving full-cycle -- a reconciliation both lush and constructive. For
instance, Tudor mansion in England was elaborately built with 52
staircases and 365 rooms...

Others who have posted here with exuberance only endured for a short
time (a very short time, relatively) compared to Alan who persists with
the perseverance of a ghost.

I am convinced of Alan's work, I cannot help but admit that. I just
encourage him to reach out beyond the supererogatory which is his
comfort and security and extend himself as I understand it. I applaud
A.S.'s creations -- but do they need to be delivered with such
pervasiveness (ie. without season)?

Even so, I would hope there is room on this list not only for Alan, but
for others as well, and for criticisms of Alan; that the list isn't so
single-minded or obstinate to only continue as a memory of itself.

Personally I'd love to see more work here; on the wryting list, we have
about 5-15 pieces a day, some by people posting daily or more. There's no
problem. There's no problem reading what one wants on the Poetics list as
well.

drn's doing the season to be sure, but he was also writing rather terrific
pieces well before that if I remember correctly - he just does that -

I cant agree wiht disagreeing with agreement and agreeing to agree on
disagreement which is more or less (shut up!) agreeing to disagree which is
disagreeable if if not stupid (for Christ's sake - shut up! go away!!) given
that to agree is to disagree in a certain degree if you agree of if you dont
agree (go away - all your ideas a re WRONG! your with me or for me! or your
against me!! ha! (bastard))  its always what goes on in your head dont you
disagree ..there  are those what have a degree you see but what disagree or
degree of agree is disagree to become glee? ( You are a Toad or a Troll - go
away!!) Agree to agree or I  will become very very disagreable  (stuff it
!!) and agree that you agree when you dont disagree with me or agree with
glee (just like a stupid flea) so i'll get me morning coffee and see if
anyone is being diagreeable outside my window (the other side of which there
nothing coital ever - so who are you!!?? eh!!!??? hm???) but probably I
agree with the sea

1950s:


T.S. ELIOT - 1959

On the role of 'place' in his work: " . . . putting it as modestly as I
can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it
wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America."


DOROTHY PARKER - 1956

"Gertrude Stein did us the most harm when she said, 'You're all a lost
generation.' That got around to certain people and we all said, 'Whee!
We're lost.'"



Release dates for remaining PDFs:

1950s: Online Now

'Tis true about the ingesting thing. The most intense buzz I had ever
had was from eating a cannabis cake.  I had to go to a poetry reading
about an hour later after eating a yummy carrot cake - and to this day
I'm still not quite certain how I got thru it.

Subject: Denial of water to Iraqi Cities during US and "allied" assaults

>>> Denial of water to Iraqi Cities during assaults

Water supplies to Tall Afar, Samarra and Fallujah have been cut off
during US attacks in the past two months, affecting up to 750,000
civilians. This appears to form part of a deliberate US policy of
denying water to the residents of cities under attack. If so, it has
been adopted without a public debate, and without consulting Coalition
partners. It is a serious breach of international humanitarian law, and
is deepening Iraqi opposition to the United States, other Coalition
members, and the Iraqi interim government.

>> EVIDENCE FOR THE DENIAL OF WATER

> Tall Afar=20
On 19 September 2004, the Washington Post reported that US forces 'had
turned off' water supplies to Tall Afar 'for at least three days' (1).
Turkish television reported a statement from the Iraqi Turkoman Front
that 'Tall Afar is completely surrounded. Entries and exits are banned.
The water shortage is very serious' (2). Al-Manar television in Lebanon
interviewed an aid worker who stated that 'the main problem facing the
people of Tall Afar and adjacent areas is shortage of water' (3). Relief
workers reported a shortage of clean water (4). Moreover, the Washington
Post reports that the US army failed to offer water to those fleeing
Tall Afar, including children and pregnant women (5).

> Samarra=20
'Water and electricity [were] cut off' during the assault on Samarra on
Friday 1 October 2004, according to Knight Ridder Newspapers (6) and the
Independent (7). The Washington Post explicitly blames 'U.S. forces' for
this (8). Iraqi TV station Al-Sharqiyah reported that technical teams
were working to 'restore the power and water supply and repair the
sewage networks in Samarra' (9). Al Jazeera interviewed an aid worker
who confirmed that 'the city is experiencing a crisis in which power and
water are cut off' (10), as well as the commander of the Samarra Police,
who reported that 'there is no electricity and no water' (11).

> Fallujah=20
On 16 October the Washington Post reported that:
'Electricity and water were cut off to the city [Fallujah] just as a
fresh wave of strikes began Thursday night, an action that U.S. forces
also took at the start of assaults on Najaf and Samarra.' (12)

Residents of Fallujah have told the UN's Integrated Regional Information
Networks that 'they had no food or clean water and did not have time to
store enough to hold out through the impending battle' (13). The water
shortage has been confirmed by other civilians fleeing Fallujah(14),
Fadhil Badrani, a BBC journalist in Falluja, confirmed on 8 November
that 'the water supply has been cut off'.

In light of the shortage of water and other supplies, the Red Cross has
attempted to deliver water to Fallujah. However the US has refused to
allow shipments of water into Fallujah until it has taken control of the
city (15).=20

> Other cases=20
There have been allegations that the water supply was cut off during the
assault on Najaf in August 2004, and during the invasion of Basra in
2003. We have not investigated these claims.

> JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE DENIAL OF WATER
Some military analysts have attempted to justify the denial of water on
tactical or humanitarian grounds. Ian Kemp, editor of military journal
'Jane's Defense Weekly', argues that:
'The longer the city [Fallujah] is sealed off with the insurgents
inside, the more difficult it is going to be for them. Eventually, their
supplies of food and water are going to dwindle' (16).

Barak Salmoni, assistant professor in National Security Affairs at the
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, told the San Francisco
Chronicle that civilians would probably be encouraged to leave Fallujah
'by cutting off water and other supplies' (17).

These arguments are deeply flawed on legal, humanitarian and political
grounds. The majority of the population of Fallujah fled before the
American attack. Those who have not already fled Fallujah are forced to
remain, since roads out of the city have been blocked (18), including by
British troops (19). Not only are those remaining unable to leave, but
they are likely to consist largely of those too old, weak, or ill to
flee - precisely the groups which will be most severely affected by a
shortage of water.=20

> REACTION IN IRAQ=20
The information reported above is more widely known in Iraq than in the
US and UK, and has had become a significant political issue. Belief that
US tactics involve denial of water is widespread. According to the LA =
Times:
'As soon as the women of Fallouja learned that four Americans had been
killed, their bodies mutilated, burned and strung up from a bridge, they
knew a terrible battle was coming. They filled their bathtubs and
buckets with water...' (20)

Condemnations of the tactic have been issued by several major Iraqi
political groups. On 1 October the Iraqi Islamic Party issued a
statement criticising the US attack on Fallujah which 'cut off water,
electricity, and medical supplies', and arguing that such an approach
'will further aggravate and complicate the security situation'. It also
called for compensation for the victims (21).

Three days later Muqtada al-Sadr criticized both the denial of water to
Samarra, and the lack of international outrage at it:
'They say that this city is experiencing the worst humanitarian
situations, without water and electricity, but no-one speaks about this.
If the wronged party were America, wouldn't the whole world come to its
rescue and wouldn't it denounce this?' (22)

Denial of water is one of the misguided tactics which increases distrust
of the Coalition forces. Asked in June how much confidence they had in
US and UK forces, 50.8% of participating Iraqis responded 'none at all',
with a further 29.5% saying 'not very much' (23).

This in turn fuels anti-American violence. A spokesman for the
Association of Muslim Scholars, one of the most significant Sunni
political groupings in Iraq, reported that the party's representative in
Samarra had told him that 'there was no water'. He argued that partly as
a result of this:=20
'The Iraqis no longer trust the Americans. It is not a question of
military manifestations. It is now a question of popular rejection for
the Americans, not for the military manifestations.' (24)

His analysis is confirmed by the Oxford Research International poll,
according to which one third of Iraqis regard attacks against Coalition
forces as 'acceptable' (25).

> REACTION IN THE UK
Awareness of this issue remains extremely limited among the British
public. The British government denies involvement. Despite inquiries
from CASI and others, they appear not to have raised the issue with
their American counterparts. UK Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram has
denied knowledge of US action to cut off water supplies in Tall Afar
(26), despite coverage in the Washington Post. Similarly Hilary Benn,
the UK Secretary of State for International Development, says he has not
discussed the issue with his American counterparts (27). This lack of
communication with the American side suggests a lack of concern for the
humanitarian implications of the conflict in Iraq, and an unwillingness
to comment on American activities. Concerning British forces, Mr. Ingram
has claimed that:=20
'With regard to the action of our own Forces, I can also confirm that we
have not cut off water supplies to civilians. It is possible that local
temporary disruptions may have occurred at some time due to damage from
combat with anti-Iraqi Forces but we are not aware of any actual cases
where this has happened' (28).

> LEGAL IMPLICATIONS
The denial of water to civilians is illegal both under Iraqi and
international law. Article 12 of the Transitional Administrative Law,
which serves as a constitution during the interim period, states that:

'Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the security of his
person' (29)=20

International law specifically forbids the denial of water to civilians
during conflict. Under Article 14 of the second protocol of the Geneva
Conventions,=20

'Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited. It is
therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless for
that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian
population such as food-stuffs, agricultural areas for the production of
food-stuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies
and irrigation works.' (30)

> RECOMMENDATIONS=20
CASI calls on Members of Parliament to raise this issue with ministers
as a matter of urgency. The UK government must use its influence with
our US ally to ensure that all military operations are conducted within
the bounds of international law. In addition to the suffering caused to
the civilian population, use of these tactics by US forces puts our own
troops at risk from rising insurgency.

We hope that the issue will be taken up by international NGOs such as
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Deliberate disruption of
civilian water supplies should be a matter of concern for all who are
promoting human rights in Iraq.

CASI urges journalists on the ground in Iraq to investigate the above
reports further, in order to build up a clearer picture of use of this
tactic. The UK media must give greater weight to the plight of civilian
populations in their coverage of conflicts such as Fallujah. The UK
public needs to know that our Coalition partner is using this illegal
tactic.=20

Not to mention that great bird, the Round Tuit. This bird often dies
because it fails to go south for the winter, constantly putting off
it's preparations to a later date. Thus when someone say's they are
going to "get a Round Tuit", you can rest assured it will never
happen, for they are a favoured bird of procrastinators.

week? Can you understand my meaning? In addition, the
demands to put order into thought's interrelations
inherent in the exercise of the difficulties of
thought often take me far from where I started
encountered by understanding in time.

I’m very sorry to heard that you were accident. File

Amy,
let's not pretend all of a sudden that Minky's post wasn't
being critical of the very things I brought up.

Of course she was, and of course it's fine that she was.

One of Minky's lines was:
"Wasn't the spirit of this listserv (merry christmas) one of sharing and
supporting each other in the business of poetry?"

To say "Wasn't" this way is to suggest we have gotten
away from the original purpose.  The "spirit of this listserv"
is Minky telling us all what the "spirit" is for us.  And some
will agree, and some will not.

Let's not play hide and seek here Amy.  If you two had
wanted to have something fun happen without being
critical, you could have chosen to do so.  But you didn't,
you chose to have fun by way of first being critical.  Which
(I repeat) is fine, but you cannot expect to be critical
(especially with poets) and not have an argument.

By the way, here was something from your post:
"Isn't it just possible that two women on the phone across the state from
each other, giddy at midnight, thought it might be fun to propose that poets
do something fun together and in unison...."

You try to make it sound as if you two were brainstorming
fun and not being critical.  "Isn't it just possible" that you
are intelligent, fun women who are capable of being both fun
and being critical?  What's so horrible about that?  Why are
you trying to lay on all the damage control here?

If you can't handle other poets disagreeing with you, next
time maybe you could try fun without the criticism.  Or maybe
you will come to do both, which I'm sure you're capable of doing.

May the "spirit" of the list remain hidden, and all voices
exact themselves, uninhibited,
CAConrad

George

You have some interesting ideas and poetry and art on your web site. The
faces and the stones are interesting andtheepory is intriguing.  I sent the
link on to my sister who is stufdying art and also another artist/poet here
in Auckland (NZ)

I get a lot ot ideas via art and wold like to be able to do something in
that area of conceptual or "intuitive" art . Yoour formula for beauty is
interesting...some lines from Whitman and "still point" from T S Eliot?  He
also refers to the axel.....in The 4 Quartets. Cage's (art) work sounds
interesting.....I read abook a ew years ago on contemp music (to catch up)
and the ideasof Cage, Stockhausen and Chalres Ives (and his father)
interested me very much.  And (including the faces) 'quotes' from Beuys and
Boltanksi etc?

Good luck with your exhibition etc

PS Some of those stones have to be glued together -no?

> In his mid 20s George Quasha met John Cage and felt his own work as poet

> the medium.
>
> Quasha’s axial stones are the result of subtle attractions and unique
> acts of balance.  He discovers individual stones, usually in or near
> rivers, and, according to the artist, “waits (minutes, days, years)
> until they discover each other”; he then “performs their act of union
> through radical balance, without changing the stones in any way and
> without any kind of stickum.”  He “works them, on an invisible axis,
> toward their most precarious point, the optimal statement of apparent
> impossibility”; this is the point where “a stone seems on the verge of
> switching elements, a liminality of earth and air.”   They “remain on
> edge, pre-climactic, impermanent, yet well seated in their perilous
> retention.”
>
> The axial drawings present a related event in the medium of graphite on

> which, unlike the conceptual, can have no definitive expression; instead
> it generates ever new instances of itself.”  A “state of free moving
> intentionality, it finds formal integrity on the fly.” Despite a
> sometimes surprising elegance in the drawing, it is in fact an
> unrepeatable event — a skill-defying act that restores the artist to
> “zero point” — a momentary innocence rather than mastery.  What appears
> is an “integrating energy” that is neither abstract nor figurative, but

"I've been listening to classical music," she tells me.
 "I find it very soothing. I need more relaxation in my life."

I think of Wagner's screams and Sousa's marches
Prussians drunk on war and power-
-Beethoven's unfinished concerto for the man he loathed
replaced by that crashing, maddening ode to the most unrelaxed passion of
all-

Disturbed, I cultivate friendships with my elders,
 and a middle-aged man tells me that he listens to classical
 music to decrease his libido.
  I think of
        thin-lipped Germans and
        bastard Russians
  Nannerl touching Johann's penis in the music room
  as Leopold narrows his resolve and
   Napoleon stiffens in history's hand

I think of Austrian celebrities dressed like women and the cuckolds who
loved them-

I tire of such intricacies.
I retreat to my childhood world of rock 'n' roll
  childish, transparent, Oedipal-
 boy meets girl, boy fucks girl, boy bashes father-in-law's head in with a
baseball bat.
Simple, pounding rhythms,
 brainless ballads of loss.
The sort of thing I can relate to.
I seek simpler sexualities.
I turn my back on majestic music and briefly wonder
 what other people hear.

Beckett was far more articulate in expressing his absurdity than I could ever
be in expressing my joy and optimism. I juxtapose these poems to illustrate
different approaches to life and poetry.

Beyond Broceliande

Silent swallows huddle upon our cottage roof
satisfied with a summer feast of mosquitoes
Cool morning mists shroud their leaving
At twilight fireflies dance a farewell flicker
tiny stars and frolicking children

Grapevines bare their sleeping limbs
Russet leaves abound beneath October's moon
Under the leafy blanket
frosted purple grapes are burst and seeping
transformation on the perfumed earth

A solitary blue jay, squawking sentinel
guarding the snowy gates of the forest
A cardinal aflame, Parzival entranced
pauses, then flitters in treetops over
turtledoves cooing in love nests

Melodious in their melting ponds
thawing frogs are frantic and croaking
looking skyward, calling down the night
singing to melancholy Orion
on his ever silent crossing

One night we flew the mayfly hatch
frenzied and free, dodging trees,
but just before dawn
three lonely loons called to each other
across twin lakes

Seven golden summers, honey combed, milky breasted
Seven little strangers made the home
a sacred garden, alive with ideas
Laughing little gods on the greenest bed
A new pool in a new land

In their secret garden we see new worlds beginning
but we must leave them for the forest
so wild and green and ever calling
Tangled and strange the trees resist
to hide the magic fountain

We dip the cup
to wet the stone
The earth and heavens kiss
Our story brings the storm clouds down
and thunder rumbles in the mist

Found Poem: Psalm 2004

Bush is my shepherd, I=A0am in want.
He maketh me to lie down on park benches,
He leadeth me beside the still factories.
He restoreth my faith in Democrats:
He leadeth me in the paths of unemployment, for God's sake.

Yea, since I walk through the valley of Ground Zero
I still fear the terrorists, though Bush is with me;
His tanks and his planes discomfort me.
He preparest a babel before me in the presence of media;
He annointest my car with oil; my wallet is empty.

Surely poverty and hard living
Shall follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in this rental unit forever.


Found Poem: Psalm 2004-a

Bush is my shepherd, I=A0shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down on Park Avenue;
He leadeth me beside the single-malt still.
He restoreth my tax cut;
He leadeth me in the paths of outsourcing, for profit's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of Ground Zero
I shall fear no terrorists, for Bush is with me;
His tanks and his planes they comfort me.
He preparest a double before me in the presence of Muslims;
He annointest my wallet with cash; my stocks rise.

Surely fast cars and loose women
Shall follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in a tract mansion forever.

Found Poem: Psalm 2004-b

Bush is my shepherd; I dwell in want.
He maketh logs to be cut down in national forests
He leadeth trucks into the still wilderness.
He restoreth my fears.
He leadeth me in the paths of international disgrace for his ego's
sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the profit of war,
I will find no exit, for thou art in office.
Thy tax cuts for the rich and thy media control, discomfort me.
Thou preparest an agenda of deception in the presence of thy
religion.
Thou anointest my head with foreign oil.
My health insurance runneth out.

Surely megalomania and false patriotism
Shall follow me all the days of thy term,
And my jobless child shall dwell in my basement forever.


Found Poem: Psalm 2004-c

Bush is my shepherd, I shall not want:
He maketh oil to be drilled in Alaskan wildlife reserves,
He carveth dune buggy tracks in the free desert.
He restoreth manifest destiny.
He leadeth me in the paths of prisoner torture, for Christ's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the profit of war,
I will fear no exit, for thou art in office.
Thy tax cuts and anti-gay message they comfort me.
Thou preparest a large mandate in the presence of slim margins.
Thou anointest my head with foreign oil;
My Hummer runneth over.

Surely flag-waving and cheap oil
Shall follow me all the days of thy term,
And Tony Blair shall dwell in the House of Lords, eventually.

Dear Craig,

“Pretending?”  “Hide and seek?”  … which you’re sure
I’m capable of doing?  Your spirit of “disagreement,”
Craig is an arrow to the ankle.  It may bring Achilles
down, but on any other mortal, it’s a pointless shot –
and off mark.  Where in my post do I “pretend” Minky
wasn’t critical?  Really, where?

In fact, I preface my post with an exact criticism
regarding the “turf” wars that take place on this list
with regularity.  In case you didn’t deduce from that
preface, I think the conversations about who can post
what and when are not only redundant, but they can
also be intimidating.  Any lurker who might be
considering posting something may hesitate & decide
not to post when he or she reads the flak that comes
from those using the “turf” in a way someone else
needs to make a fuss over instead of just deleting.

As you selectively quoted from my last post, you
omitted a very important part, “Even now, Minky’s main
[MAIN] sentiment is disregarded, one that suggests,
yes, a kind of silly playfulness but also (albeit
simplistic) a call to do something together and be
supportive of and in the tiny world that is poetry.”


I think it’s very telling that, once again, you have
chosen to disregard the intent of Minky’s original
post (& my follow-up) to focus on the fact that she
originally mentioned fragmentation, which was an
impetus to figuring out how to do something fun via
this list, and in turn, falsely accuse me of something
so trivial as to pretend that I’m not critical.

In your original response to Minky, you schooled us
girls on the idea that we should accept that poets are
disagreeable, understand the need for people in the
world who can say no, see that conflict is healthy for
poetics, AND that I should look to the German workers
fighting the 40 hour work week!  Do you think I live
in a bubble, Craig?  You’re assuming a great deal
about my consciousness and thinking abilities based on
your need to scold me for “pretending” and “playing
hide and seek”—falsely so.

I have a feeling that your “faith” in my ability to be
critical as well as fun is really an opportunistic
convenience you have noted in order to place yourself
in the position of  schoolmaster over myself and
Minky, the two mischievous girls who haven’t fully
learned your lessons.

So your lesson instructing me to acknowledge that we
were critical is moot.  But your condescending tone
comes through clearly.  As for conflict, isn’t there
some saying about choosing your battles wisely?  Your
version of conflict and my own, most likely, veer
greatly.  However, I acknowledge that I am
intentionally participating in a conflict you continue
to try to define in fruitless measure. The reason I am
doing so is because I would like to say something
about tone here.  I have just noted that you’ve been
condescending to myself and Minky while totally
disregarding everything else in our post.  I have
found over the years that the anonymity of this list
(in that most of us are names on a screen only) seems
to translate into license for some people to say
things to each other in a way that they never would in
person, and by that I mean, I imagine the thinking to
be something along the lines of “Well, I’ll probably
never meet that person so I’ll just tell it like it is
& show her who really knows what – no holds barred.”
I am speaking from experience here.  Over the years,
I’ve read some responses on this list that were plain
old rude, only to meet the person and find that, in
fact, he or she is quite polite, friendly, doesn’t
speak like that in person, etc. And yes, critical
thinking.   This has happened on more than one
occasion.

So my questions to you, Craig, are:  Do you think if
we met in person, you would discuss mine and Minky’s
original proposition or do you think you would simply
ignore it?  Do you think you would be compelled to
lecture me on the necessity of conflict in the
evolution of poetics or point out how my original
proposition came about because I was thinking
critically?   And do you think you would assume that I
“can’t handle poets disagreeing with” me or do you
think we would be able to discuss a matter on which we
might not agree in a critical way without being
condescending?

I hope that somehow this discussion encourages other
lurkers to use the listserv as though they are
entitled – it’d be nice to hear from other poets
elsewhere who don’t post (& I’d be happy to hear from
you backchannel too).

Amy,
first to answer your question, yes, I would discuss
this in person.  You're in NY?  I'll let you know when
I'm up there next.

And I didn't ignore anything, I believe I made it clear
in the last post that you were both looking for something
to do which was fun.

My feeling was, and still is, that you were trying to make
light of one part of the original post by Minky, while
emphasizing what you wanted emphasized.  This is
of course the very thing you are accusing me of doing.

It's funny you say you feel that I was trying to "school"
you "girls" (you of course are attempting to turn this
into an argument that I'm sexist, but frankly, I don't care
what your gender is) when in fact the very tone of the
original post had that very tone:  the tone of enlightening
others with the "spirit" of the list, etc.

To quote a good friend of mine, if you projected anymore
you'd be a multiplex.

And also, I'm glad you're so disagreeable, rock on,
CAConrad

Dear Mr. Kehir:

As you may have gathered from previous correspondence posted to this site,
my attempt to provide you with a diphthong from my product line has met with
considerable opposition. I am pleased to say that I have used my innate
resourcefulness, as well as my experience as a bureaucrat in a corrupt
Connecticut bureaucracy and as a Florida voter to make arrangements for you
to purchase your autographed diphthong at::

http://www.cafepress.com/unlikely2/425584

The item you requested will appear in the upper left corner of your monitor.

I hope you wear it with pride and comfort. It is my pleasure to provide you
with customized items from the Vernon Frazer product line.

On a more personal note, I wish to thank you for providing me with this
opportunity to grow and develop in my life as a commodity. It seems a shame
that so few recognize that commodities are people, too.

Sincerely,

The Vernon Frazer
Author, Commercial Fiction

Dear Mr. Penton:

In the face of an unresponsive corporate bureaucracy such as yours, I find
myself forced to meet the needs of the customers of my product line by any
means necessary.

If you truly believed, as does Ralph Putz, the professional Role Model who
coined Commercial Fiction's motto, that "SHOWING UP IS 100% OF LIFE," you
would have shown up to provide Mr. Kehir with the item he requested. Since
you did not show up to address this consumer's legitimate request, I can
only assume that you are a regular putz and a mere Woody Allen derivative,
the kind of person who believes that "showing up is 85% of life." No matter
your title or presumed authority, your attitude will never allow you to
become a role model of the stature of Ralph Putz. Obviously, 15% of you is
always absent.

I am pleased to do whatever is necessary to provide customer service to
people interested in the Vernon Frazer Product line. It is clearly a hot
commodity.

You may eventually find out how I created the "Commercial Diphthongs" line
and placed it on the cafepress.com site. But you will never "catch" me. I
have worked as a "hack" in a highly political environment and have stood in
line watching "hacked" voting machines in South Florida. As a result, I am
not without experience or resources, which you will soon discover.

You see, my "people" arranged, during the last election, to "hack" the
computerized voting machines so that every Bush vote would issue a vote for
you as dog catcher for the entire state of Florida. The government is
already noticing that you have yet to show up for your job, and that you (or
someone using your name) are collecting pay checks for that position.
Moreover, the investigation has revealed that you are not a Florida
resident, which means that you are legally ineligible for the job to which
you were elected and for which you are receiving a salary for work you are
not doing. Moreover, the Department of Immigration in El Paso is
investigating your immigration status, to determine whether you are a legal
or illegal alien, and your planet of origin. You can expect to be deported
after your Florida incarceration. Cape Canaveral is expecting you.

So, while you may use your wiles to pursue me, you will, at some point, have
to use them to address---unsuccessfully---the complicated legal situations
that you will soon find yourself embroiled in.

I may be a commodity, but I am not a mindless one. I suggest you find a new
career by auditioning for the next remake of The Fugitive.

Sincerely,

The Vernon Frazer,
Hot Commodity

There's little in taking or giving,
  There's little in water or wine;
This living, this living, this living
  Was never a project of mine.
Oh, hard is the struggle, and sparse is
  The gain of the one at the top,
For art is a form of catharsis,
  And love is a permanent flop,
And work is the province of cattle,
  And rest's for a clam in a shell,
So I'm thinking of throwing the battle--
  Would you kindly direct me to hell?

Seriously, you probably know The Poetry Center, but
SF Cinematheque is a screening venue for experimental film, and
since there are few careers in experimental film, i'd say we are
all the BEST kind of amateurs.  I personally am a volunteer.

But if you're asking if the people in the films and making the
work have enough name recognition for one to know their work,
i'd say yes.  Helen Adam, Charles Olson, Alan Sondheim, Kathy
Acker, Robert Creeley, Theresa Cha, Stan Brakhage, Joanne Kyger,
Charles Bernstein, Jess, Dodie Bellamy, Frank O'Hara, Anne
Waldman, Abigail Child, Laura Moriarty, Leslie Scalapino,
Michael McClure, Carla Harryman, and many more, spread over the
three shows in the series.

More info:

>  Any possibility of meeting filmmakers there?

I certainly hope so.  This series was designed to get the two
communities to mix, and document the historical overlap between
them over the course of the last 50 years in the Bay Area.

If you come, i'm a filmmaker -- introduce youself!

The first show is
(this) Thursday Nov. 18th
Yerba Buena Center for the Arts
Mission and Third Streets, in San Francisco

Thanks,

An NYT article on subway graffiti.

Maybe this attention will bring back graffiti covered subways in place of those
platered with applique adverts.

On the Red Line subway in Boston, there's a section where several large
flatscreens are mounted along each side of the tunnel, level and visible to the
windows of the subway car. Static image is repeated in sequences of several
screens, so that at a high speed the illusion of video is given as the subway
moves through an area of about 1/4 mile long. It was a disappointment that it
was not an intallation of art, but an advertisement for Target.

back in '85, one of my friends showed me a video his brother (who hung out
with the Rock Steady Crew) had taped off of PBS a couple years earlier...the
video, Style Wars, got me hooked...we didn't have trains in san diego, but
we had plenty of wall space, freeway space, & billboard space...it was bombs
away...

An NYT article on subway graffiti.

Maybe this attention will bring back graffiti covered subways in place of
those
platered with applique adverts.

On the Red Line subway in Boston, there's a section where several large
flatscreens are mounted along each side of the tunnel, level and visible to
the
windows of the subway car. Static image is repeated in sequences of several
screens, so that at a high speed the illusion of video is given as the
subway
moves through an area of about 1/4 mile long. It was a disappointment that
it
was not an intallation of art, but an advertisement for Target.

I'm convinced that voter fraud ruled that day and that Bush
scraped into office again by criminal means...that more
people aren't outraged or even talking about this (not talking
about the Po list) is amazing...finally mainstream media is touching
the subject very carefully....is Kerry willing to let Independents
do the "dirty" work...are Dems so afraid of the political Repug
machine they're just going to lay down for the next four years...
I'm feeling like none of this is surprising but at the same time
all of this amounts to a BLOODLESS COUP

Read on...write your representative if you haven't done so
demanding audits of these votes...spread the word

BOX OF UNCOUNTED VOTES 'DISCOVERED' IN FLORIDA
(St. Petersburg Times, Nov 16)

The unmarked brown box sat unnoticed in the Pinellas Supervisor of
Elections office until Monday, two weeks after the election, when an
employee cleaning a desk stumbled upon it.

Inside were 268 uncounted absentee ballots.

"I think this is a very serious situation," Supervisor of Elections
Deborah Clark said Monday, vowing to fire or discipline any employee
found to be negligent.

"I assume all responsibility for everything that happened in that
department, but I have to rely on other people," Clark said. "It's not
a one-woman show."

The unmarked box wasn't the only problem.

Five days ago, Clark sent the state the county's final results for the
Nov. 2 election. But her office had failed to perform a standard check
to ensure that all ballots had been accounted for.

Clark assumed her staff had performed the check, but they had not.

Now she will ask the state for permission to change Pinellas' official
results. The canvassing board will count the missing ballots Thursday.

Although it is numerically possible, officials say the missing ballots
probably won't change any results. Only a few races were decided by
less than 268 votes - including the presidential contest.

George W. Bush won the presidential race in Pinellas by just 226 votes.
While Bush's margin in Pinellas could change, his statewide victory
won't.

A city commission seat in South Pasadena and a referendum in Indian
Rocks Beach were also decided by fewer than 268 votes.

"If you found a couple hundred thousand votes in Ohio, that might be
exciting," said Paul Bedinghaus, chairman of the Pinellas Republican
Party. "I expect that human error will continue to occur as long as
human beings are involved."

This is the third time since Clark became election supervisor in 2000
that her office has had problems handling ballots.

In the presidential race in 2000, the office neglected to count 1,400
ballots - and counted more than 900 ballots twice. In 2001, her office
misplaced six absentee ballots in a Tarpon Springs city election.

The uncounted absentee ballots this time came from the St. Petersburg
election office.

Election workers there put absentee ballots in a box to be delivered to
the election service center in Largo, where they would be counted on
Election Day.

That afternoon, a staff courier delivered the box from St. Petersburg
to Largo.

Clark said her office has a system to track the boxes, but she could
not describe it in detail during a phone interview from her home Monday
night.

The box arrived at the election office, where it sat in plain sight in
the absentee ballot department for 14 days.

Office spokeswoman Lori Hudson said other boxes and papers were piled
on top of the box. The ballot box was not marked in any unique way.
Clark could not say Monday why the box was not specially marked.

Voters, accustomed to putting punch card ballots in locked metal boxes,
had been uneasy when they saw election officials throw absentee ballots
in a brown box in the St. Petersburg office, said Democratic lawyer
Peter Wallace.

Even before Election Day, missing ballots had caused embarrassment for
another election supervisor. Hillsborough Supervisor of Election Buddy
Johnson had been criticized in October after his staff lost 245 ballots
in the Aug. 31 primary.

Normally, Clark would have detected the missing ballots when her staff
checked to ensure that every ballot was accounted for.

Usually, every ballot, whether filed absentee or at a polling place, is
registered into a computer system. After the election, workers compare
the number recorded in the computer to the number of ballots.

For some reason, the staff did not perform the procedure.

Clark learned about the missing ballots on Monday afternoon. Clark did
not return to the office because she said she needed to be with her
husband, who is having surgery.

Her staff, though, worked past 5 p.m. She promised a thorough
investigation.

"If we determine that this is the result of negligence, then those
responsible will be held accountable," Clark said. "I can assure you of
that."

larry, i think we're all just a little burned out on election
politics at the moment, yknow...

but do you really think---and i don't mean to be skeptical about this
just for the sake of being skeptical---do you really think that kerry
was shorted by 3 million votes?... of course that's the popular
margin (which for me is what should count---whether this means a
repub or a dem gets elected)... i understand that the margins are
narrower in electoral terms, but do you believe that these
inaccuracies (let's say)---and we always have them, yknow---could
push the margin back in kerry's favor?... i'm not so sure...

i'd like to point out here, in this regard, that total votes for
democratic senators (assuming we can trust the count, right?) far
outnumbered votes for republican senators... a chief problem with the
configuration of the senate is that we nonetheless ended up with more
repub senators... but worth noting that more people voted for
democratic senators, by a wide margin...

best,

joe

I am dismayed by the quick adoption of 'fight-or-flight' attitudes in
response to constructive-minded criticisms -- (ie. appreciations from
myself that have been largely questions asking for clarity; my
sentiments are pro-sondheim!). There appears to be only a 2-dimensional
experience of looking at art here -- either you are for us or against us
(eerily like present-day politics).

I understand, speaking for myself, that I am somewhat removed from the
age-group which dominates the list and I also understand what strong
connections many list members have formed with fellow-artists, but I am
amazed how engagement and dialogue on-list so often proceeds directly to
pointing out (often fabricating) exclusions (like po-survivor tv) only
to lead to rallying and flag-waving in passive-aggressive shows of
identity. Quickly the only game in town is consideration of who is on
what side (purely a numbers game ~ quantity) and entirely turned-away
from engagement and dialogue itself. Come on po-list! Are we really so
provincial? Are we like flash-mob celebrities who get caught with the
wrong dress on or in the wrong place, seen making a mistake, and poof!
our stylized-career is over? I think if you identify with externals you
don't have a leg to stand on (looking outward for all your support).
Anyway, this disturbs me and seems like one hand washing the other. If
this is true for art, then it really doesn't matter what we create --
only how much we can get people to cheer for it (an exercise in
pervasiveness; quantity on parade; a dog-and-pony show). I'm writing
about this now, and addressing this very phenomenon, because people die
-- so it seems exceedingly difficult to sustain an art which requires a
continual type of support since oncoming generations do not have the
benefit of the living-propaganda, but would likely create their own, or
more likely not bother with the disingenuous as the advantage network
once carried would be erased. Still too, one can imagine the pariah...


One too can imagine an art appreciation based solely on people's
reaction (foregoing the art altogether as merely incendiary) -- is there
already a name for this school of criticism? It amazes me how much
advertising works like this. Indeed, if the only value consideration for
art becomes its quantifiable effect then we can leave the artist behind.
The artist need only show up, accept thanks, and collect on the
accolades.

More is truly more effect-wise, and the artist need not bother with
anything (indeed be unscrupulous) other than to gauge their
consideration.


Local Area Network - gauge



Food for thought, not for flaming -- Derek

Dear Ms. Daly:

In response to the e-mail sent to our office regarding your concerns
about early voting at the Richard Riordan Public Library, the
Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk would like you to know how much we
appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback to us.  It is largely
through information from voters such as you that we are able to refine
our election services delivery system.

Los Angeles County is currently using the Diebold Direct Entry Voting
Machines.  These "touchscreen machines" are not connected by radio or
telephone to the headquarters of the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk in
Norwalk.  The card you received to activate the Touchscreen unit, a
Voter Access Card (VAC), commonly known as a "smartcard," did not
contain any personal information about you or how you voted.  The card's
memory chip is used to tell the Touchscreen unit which precinct you live
in so that the correct ballot style appears on the screen.  Once you
touched "Cast Ballot" and the VAC ejected from the unit, it was
deactivated.  Votes are stored on both a hard drive in the Touchscreen
unit and a removable flashdisk used to transfer the votes to tally
software at our Norwalk Headquarters.  Tamper evident seals and pouches
are used by our staff to maintain the security of these flashdisks at
all times, In accordance with the security processes prepared by this
Department and approved by the California Secretary of State.

Thank you again for bringing your concern to our attention.

Amy!  What news!

Now, don't be too disappointed if I don't wear schoolmaster attire!
But you can call me Schoolmaster (since it seems to help you
form your opinion of me), provided of course that I get to call
you Projection Master.

I'm amused by your insistence that I must be rude.  Why is it
when someone is disagreeable (especially in cases where they
are annoyed at being "schooled" in etiquette) they are accused
of being rude?

So you wonder who I am?  Right back at you Amy.  I'm curious
if you will attempt to brand me a misogynist again, pretending
that I think of you as a "girl."

Or, when your argument weakens and rolls away from you,
if you appeal to everyone in the room to champion the cause,
like you did at the end of your post, asking for the "lurkers"
to rise up and post!

It's a shame you're so afraid of me when you don't even
know me.  But then again, you ARE the Projection Master,
so maybe it's your fear of yourself you see in me?

We'll have fun at La Tazza on Saturday,
see you then,
Schoolmaster Conrad

Face it - women are like the sea - imponderable: this is not my misogyony
just an ancient ancient truth we men fail to learn at our peril - and we
never learn it -  as women always win - and nature so designs us not to
win - my thesis is that you two are falling in love  - simple as that --
there is nothing complex abnout this - Amy is a very feminine woman and is
after a man - any man!  Beware !!

And it doesnt matter what either of you say:  men will be lining up to
"protect" or side with Amy even if they know nothing of her - and others
(fewer) will side with your logic - but cold logic and intelligence always
loses to "intuition"and emotion (or so the bullshit goes) - that is
irrelevant - it is now a question of which of you "wins" and of ocurse the
argument - the struggle will never end......

I am certain this the beiginning of something very rich and strange for
you - not just an insidious argument of tedious intent: nor would I venture
that Amy is an expert shit stirrer - nay....but its all in Shakespear and
the novels....after the novels, the teacups,......if not Eliotian or Mills
and Boony perhaps something from Joyce Carol Oates? Or a Russian Novel?  And
someone mentioned Keat's poems  Lamia !!!! and La Belle Dame.... !!!!

And yet this is, even if it was meant tongue-in-cheek, which I am assuming
it was not, sexist and misogynistic and, since it assumes an awful lot about
both Amy's and Conrad's sexualities, participates not a little in the
overriding heterosexual narrative of our culture, and so it is, as a
statement, homophobic--though I want to be clear, since I do not know
Richard Taylor, that I am saying nothing about him personally. I am merely
characterizing something I see in what he wrote. His statement, therefore,
is ultimately a trivialization of the argument Amy and Conrad are having,
and, precisely because it attempts as a statement to disown the politics
that inform it, while passing those politics off as some kind of universal
truth, it is insidious as well: At the very least, it conjures up the notion
of the hysterical-because-she-can-be-nothing-other-than-emotional-woman by
suggesting that Amy's quite logical responses to Conrad--and whether you
agree with them or not, you have to admit that they are logical and coherent
as responses to what Conrad wrote--are nothing of the sort.

By Taylor's own logic--and I use his last name to avoid confusion since we
share the same first name--this post perhaps makes me one of the "men [who]
will be lining up to 'protect' or side with Amy," and so I want to be clear
that this is not a personal defense of Amy--whom I happen to know pretty
well and who I know is perfectly capable of defending herself. I find
Taylor's statement troublesome and problematic in itself for the reasons I
cited above, and I think, as I said above, that it is ultimately a
trivialization of both Amy and Conrad as people and of the positions they
have taken in their exchange.

Steve is right onto it, his poem reminded me...that just came on the news
"if he werent dead he sure dead now" ..ok the soldiers are somewhat the
pawns in this terrible game...yet

the way things are going and the soldier -ok he was wounded in a trap by
some freedom fighters "palying possum" prior to the kiling of that wounded
man, but... - and then he (in a similar situation) shot the wounded guy but
this situation he is in the US is in (we are all in) " if he wasnt dead he
is now" maybe that soldier isnt so bad but the POWERS the murderers that put
him there - I cant see the difference - much - between Nazi Germany invading
Poland and France in 1939 and the US invading Afghanistan and Iraq in 2003
and on. There is no intention to pullout or stop.

The murderers in charge of the USA must be stopped by any means. They
utterly destroyed Fallujah and eg one instance afamily of five were killed
trying to cross the river out of the town by helicopter fire..the military
over there are murderers- their commanders are murderers, all the way to the
top they are murderers and killers.

And the Democrats would be no better - Kerry was boasting of wanting to kill
and find terrorists - that is he would fulfil on the promiseof war - the war
that does nothing to stop "terrorism" if anything creates it. Anything to
get votes Kerry and Bush are two sides of the corrupt bastard murderous
coins. They kill for power and votes and the others stay silent. They are as
guilty.

The Bottom of the Ocean

She watches herself in her water;
every silver orb a face to dance a wave,
every wave an undulating Goddess hip.
Atlantic moon pours out her cold remorse,
and stirs the skin above the great abyss.

At first my eyes were open,
the light of faces in my desperate dreams,
cloying at my meaning, given names,
afloat and touched like trances
ever onward toward my truth.

Yet sinking ever deeper I grew blind,
commingling tears with deeper darker flows,
hard pressing every secret from my soul;
to write the truth onto this archived wall,
at the bottom of the ocean in my blood.

Every savior sleeps beneath this flood,
shadows haunting temple ruins below,
drifting in the current of the dark,
renamed at last by drunkenness and fear
too deep to reach the light of common sense.

And every kingdom settles to this floor
tossed to twisted wrecks by storms of words,
grand endeavors crushed beneath the weight
of endless tears of error from blinded eyes.

Each Atlantis finds its falling star.
And when a heart is waiting to explode,
a heaving chest exhausted just for breath
lingering just to sing this song of death,
"Come kiss me, hold me close, and say goodbye"
at the bottom of the ocean - there we are.

a paradox is a situation

Dear Chicago/Wisconsin Poetry Community:

I realize that our region has been deluged recently with readings many
overlapping forcing us to choose where to go to hear great poetry. But this
Sunday there is no scheduling conflict and I want to urge all of you to
attend two readings; Many of you know Marvin Tate he is is a poet of great
range and he is reading with Adeena Karasick at Myopic at 5:00 P.M. and of
course you all know Charles Bernstein, Language Poet and Critic of Blessed
Memory and Michael Goulish a rising star in Poetry.

http://chicagopostmodernpoetry.com/rdingnov.htm#Sun21%205pm

Sunday 21 - 5:00 p.m. - Adeena Karasick and Marvin Tate

Myopic Series ( 1564 N Milwaukee in Wicker Park )

Sunday 21 - 7:00 p.m. - Charles Bernstein-Michael Goulish

Discrete Series ( 3030 W Cortland Ave in Humboldt Park )

I hope that all of you come out for one or both of these readings and
support what is happening in Chicago poetically the animators of our reading
series put in allot of time to bring us the best readings every month so I
hope to see you all there.

Thanks, Richard, for the kind words and interest.
I'm in the process of installing the show, so this has to be brief. I'll come back to you on your questions,
which require thought, after the opening.  Meanwhile some of it is covered in the "Axial Stones" piece
in Ecopoetics 2, also on my site.  A new piece "Axial Drawing" takes it further, in Open Space Magazine 6,
which I will put on the site later.  And there's the older piece "Axial Poetics" in various places on the web,
try:
http://beehive.temporalimage.com/archive/51arc.html

The stones are not glued together.  I never change a stone or add anything to make them stick. Someone said,
"put a rod there, no one will know."  I said, "I will know."

Thanks, and more later,
George

George

You have some interesting ideas and poetry and art on your web site. The
faces and the stones are interesting andtheepory is intriguing.  I sent the
link on to my sister who is stufdying art and also another artist/poet here
in Auckland (NZ)

I get a lot ot ideas via art and wold like to be able to do something in
that area of conceptual or "intuitive" art . Yoour formula for beauty is
interesting...some lines from Whitman and "still point" from T S Eliot?  He
also refers to the axel.....in The 4 Quartets. Cage's (art) work sounds
interesting.....I read abook a ew years ago on contemp music (to catch up)
and the ideasof Cage, Stockhausen and Chalres Ives (and his father)
interested me very much.  And (including the faces) 'quotes' from Beuys and
Boltanksi etc?

Good luck with your exhibition etc

PS Some of those stones have to be glued together -no?

> which, unlike the conceptual, can have no definitive expression; instead
> it generates ever new instances of itself."  A "state of free moving
> intentionality, it finds formal integrity on the fly." Despite a
> sometimes surprising elegance in the drawing, it is in fact an
> unrepeatable event -- a skill-defying act that restores the artist to

Mathew Goulish is one of Goat Island, a fabulous performance group out
of Chicago, active throughout the past decade. His 'Microlectures' was
published a few years back by Routledge. Hardly a rising star, but
terrific nonetheless.

Yesterday, interestingly enough, I backchanneled Craig
a lengthy response in order to avoid the "he said, she
said" triviality that is now spiraling into
anti-feminist rhetoric.  Craig, of course, did not
reply to my backchannel.

I wrote Craig personally in an effort to have an
actual conversation and to avoid putting on a show for
the empty victory of center stage that Craig so
desperately lusts after.  Craig, apparently, is
incapable of conversation that doesn't involve making
himself the spectacle, and disappointingly, Chris has
declared that the "rumble" is on.  The proverbial
stage of machismo is set  – yes, I said it.  And now,
anti-feminist rhetoric serves as license, once again,
to write insulting, unproductive posts, only this time
with a more overt battle mentality.  Obviously, my
backchannel post has inspired a sense of defensiveness
in Craig that has resulted in public grandstanding.

Now Craig has thrown down the gauntlet and declared me
"afraid" of him.  If fear is what's at stake, then
this explains why he will not answer my private email.
 Name-calling and insults only go so far with an
audience of one -- and insults don't make for good
conversation.

I will reiterate my earlier point.  I have watched
many people on this list write something in an effort
to be constructive.   Minky was gleeful in posting
something the other night in her attempt to utilize
this list and ask some poets to come together to
display some sort of support in the name of poetry –
simple as that.  Her plan wasn’t thought out
thoroughly, but that also added to the sentiment of
doing something together:  poets could contribute
ideas to a joint project.  She was giddy as she wrote;
I heard it in her voice – and I also warned her based
on the history of this list, “Someone is going to try
to shoot you down just for the hell of it.  I
guarantee it.”  And sure enough, the few in the room
who battle for center stage are clambering all over
each other, trampling on Minky’s original optimistic
attempt.

This listserv is comprised of about 1,000 people.  It
seems to me that a core group of less than 40 post and
have discussion with any regularity.  Many people on
this listserv, as several recent backchannels to me
have echoed and affirmed, simply don’t want to be
bothered with the ensuing attacks of opportunistic
misinterpretation that follow.  One woman wrote that
she simply doesn’t have the time for this “version of
community.”  And frankly, I don’t either.  It’s really
too bad that the clambering few can put people off
from using this great resource.  But rest assured,
they do--so many don’t want to be trampled on for the
sake of the sport.  And it’s such a shame that the
tramplers are few in number.

I am happy, ultimately, that several people have
posted poems – and I’ve enjoyed reading them.  It
would be nice to get a sample of the many others out
there who are doing things in the name of poetry –  to
find out what they’re writing as well as read about
poetic happenings that don’t necessarily fall under
the heading of reading and publication announcements.
And it would be even better if they could post freely
without fear of admonishment from the self-proclaimed
schoolmasters of the list who believe in disagreeing
solely for the purpose of disagreeing because they’ve
hollowly deemed it “productive.”

I can only finally say that I am not alone in my
annoyance over this kind of tediousness, esp. the kind
that is riddled with condescending attitudes – several
are tired of such narcissism and remain lurkers
because of it.  I’m getting repetitive here, I know,
but one’s point must be driven in for those who
ignore, ignore, ignore.  I say to the lurkers, use the
list as though you were entitled, and if enough people
post, the Conrads of the world won’t be able to shoot
everyone down for fun & sport – they won’t be able to
set and control the tone.  There can be many uses for
this list that certainly go beyond disagreeing for
conflict’s sake.

And on Saturday, Craig, should I actually meet you, I
won’t play into your version of “fun.”  As far as I’m
concerned, you’ve been condescending and insulting to
me in this public forum, and that’s just as good as
doing so in person.  If you decide that you’re capable
of having a conversation that doesn’t entail more
grandstanding and insults or baiting, do something

The True Story of Another Noon

by Amy King

Another noon sits squarely on my shoulders
laughing as if the world depended
on his recurrence in blue wig and
in gold lame dress I sit solidly on
the George Washington Bridge literally
seated as if I were passing
through once upon a time only
trying to take every exhaust fume
and windshield smile in one breath
we're given until we use it each
in simultaneous gasp at the sight
of another noon landing on our other
back to alleviate the last one's wreck

And let's not forget what (I think) precipitated Minky's proposal: the=20
irruption of all that "troll" language, and the defamation of a list-member=

all.

sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

The initial Duncan if I mistake not is from Poem Beginning with a Line from
Pindar, in Opening of the Field. But all of my books are in storage
(again!), so I can't check for you. Likewise the3 Olson, which are indeed
from Maximus, but I don't remember if George is spot on aas to which poem
therein. But a read-through of Maximus if you have the time would seem in
any case de rigueur.

Amy!  After I stopped laughing at your latest
post I thought, Oh my god, I wonder if she'd
be interested in being my biographer!

I mean, I don't have to do very much at all
and you paint me into this colorful outlaw!

When you come to Philly we'll argue and smoke
and drink martinis and get the hell to work on
you writing a fabulous book about me!

Oh!  More than ANYthing I'd love for you to spend
a whole chapter on that bank robbery I didn't do!
But I talk about doing it all the time, so that counts,
doesn't it?

Thanks so much Amy, you're the best!
Sincerely,
Schoolmaster Conrad
p.s. should I bring photos of old boyfriends or what?
I'm not sure how this biography thing goes.

making films  it's alot like alot of the mooshmosh poetry goin around
these days  n.y. is full of it  bad  stuff robbed from the net and from
newspapers  sure we  all steal  bits of text and speech  here and there
cut it all up our own way but  where's the HEART  the HEART  there's a
cold hole in there instead my second post will have that pome (based on
feldman piece) from tonight  but now onto that found- in -draw -and
-that's -where- it- belongs pome  shit i was prominantly featured in that
chinese post-beat anthology  aH WELL THAT'S THE STORY of my life

brooklyn  anyone ever wanna hear about it just ask  me and not sol yurick
 if he's still alive i'm sure he'd have no memory of it  oh yeh shit onto
that fond fund fun  fondue  pome

maybe i'll dream

a watertower
& when climbing to it's top
i'll fall into a big green sea

maybe i'll dream
of ice cream
& while it melts
i'll close my eyes

maybe i'll dream of
television & rocks
& in a struggle one will break
the
other
                 (stones-walls)

maybe i'll dream of walls

as my head & face press up against one
clouds
appear

maybe i'll dream of you & me
as they enter
we will disappear    ( as we entered)

b.(comes after a.)

her face @ the window looked familiar
tho i knew like in all dreams
i had never seen her before

her hands   her hair
seemed so   personal
tho as she approached i knew
it was a only dream

she was cold
distant
& the car turned 'round
in 90 degree
jerks

with the graffito of whiteness
gone
will freedom become
a dream?

3.

maybe i'll dream  2 bananas
with the chiquita brand
& as i press them against
my ears
my lips will form a perfect
                  "O"

upon a sheet of  dark blue velvet folds
their yellow arches move to form a heart

y.
one day lord shiva while walking thru the hills
met a woman worshipping a dead cobra
he waved her aside
& w/ his magic brought the cobra back to life
from that day on  the people worshipped
live cobras

maybe when i lay me down to sleep
tonight
i'll count live cobras
then maybe i'll dream about
dead
sheep.

I think the poet of this meant to write "variable" or maybe "viable"  - but
this shows a sensitivty and talent in language an I was "pulled up" by it.
I like the:

'bells on dusty sidewalks' and 'I have built hells of (variable) material'

Interesting all of it. Interesting to see more from Ian.

That steals the common from the goose.

the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first

pre-approved topic (good teaching method, report on a community organization, how to

deal with other staff at your school site, how to protect yourself from

administrators, info on new legislation, Raza Studies,

etc.).

•To demonstrate moral/professional support for members (if they are being

harassed by administration we could send letters of support, etc.).

•To advocate for the community

•Members in good standing could receive certificate/plaque to place in

classroom, office, or home.

•Meetings and other ARE activities could be used as professional growth, for

what is labelle's systematic odor? who is Labelle? why resort to
adolescent themes of smell?

btw, what I mean by this is that there is NO "political unconscious".

I posted this poem and comment awhile ago at another group and thought you
might enjoy it. Too lazy to edit much. Too much alliteration. I think the quote
is from 'Memory Babe.'

to b or not to b

be-bop babe
benzedrine
barbiturates
booze
banefully bi-sexual
biographical bathos
bi-polar buddhist
balding
belligerent
ball-less
brutally beautifully banal
botched

Jack Kerouac set out to be the best American writer that ever lived, but he
didn't know how to live. Instead he filled his life with excessive friends and
experiences - like a Pollack painting, a frenzy. He was forever traumatized by
the childhood death of his brother Gerard who said that dying and going to
heaven was the best thing ever. When Jack innocently and joyfully announced
Gerard's death to his family, they were horrified, and so it began. His life
became a morality play of this very philosophical paradox.

"His final point - is to suggest that life completely perceived is poetry, is
art, and needs no labor of pen, brush, or anything else to make it so: 'Of
course there's someplace to go! Go mind your own business.' Again Kerouac
affirms the nobility of silence; it is more honest than talk, and the only cure for
vanity. But since he failed to keep that silence himself at a point where it
was called for - his life going farther out of kilter even as his art
approached an ideal serenity - there is nothing more for him to say but 'Forget it,
wifey. Go to sleep. Tomorrow's another day."

Well, David, says I, showing off (perhaps mistakenly) your Google Volunteer
of the week is pleased to offer the winning passage with the real quote. I
take it  -the quote -  to be an ironic view of the growing power of the wife
in a marriage from which there be no exit.

It's after school, I will take my prize in cookies and milk. What, you did
not offer a prize? I guess I am on my way to becoming a real winner.

From Three Lives: The Good Anna: Part Two: The Life of the Good Anna
by Gertrude Stein


...In friendship, power always has its downward curve. One's strength to
manage rises always higher until there comes a time one does not win, and
though one may not really lose, still from the time that victory is not
sure, one's power slowly ceases to be strong. It is only in a close tie such
as marriage, that influence can mount and grow always stronger with the
years and never meet with a decline. It can only happen so when there is no
way to escape.

steve

thanks. I'm not exactly sure this is what I was
looking for but this helps. I could swear there
was a quote very similar to the one I quoted but
it may have been in her long long essay on english
literature... not sure. also it may have been yogi
berra or casey stengel or something like that. if
anyone else has suggestions please let me know.
milk and cookies on me.

Even tho Daniel Carter is one of the few improvisors who make it a
respectable form, I'm always suspicious of poetry readings that involve
saxophones. But never the phonemes of medieval Jewish mystical texts.

So hmmm. I might just well be your mother saying"Oh Bethany, I heard of this
really neat poetry that you'll really enjoy

Adeena's show at this year's Vision Fest (w/ Tod Nicholson) seemed to attest
as much to HER ability to improvise... it should be an ample give and take
with all assembled for the gig.Wishing I could be there.

And I wish I could be there as well. The remarks from me below were intended
for a friend in NY I was attempting to forward the reading announcement to,
but I accidentally sent it back to the list; sorry about that. Not trying to
cause misunderstandings. Not right now anyway. For the record, though, I am
a fan of Adeena Karasick's books, but still weary of mixing sax w/ voiced
page. But if she's an improvisor in her own right, as Mr. Jerry claims, then
it's a different territory....

this is really sad  have you ever read  with a sax player?  well i have
they can be too loud and get in the way because they are like another
voice  or like daniel  joe mcphee many others i've read with be an equal
voice . suspicious of what? what are you suspicious of? or is that just a
figure of speech  Music and poetry as a combo?  just sax and voice  what?
 you've hit a nerve there my boy  you sound like you know daniel and his
work  so you should be aware of how respectful he can be if he needs too
or is asked to
i read with him on two occasions  where he was too damned respectful  and
on other occassions where i had to scream or keep quiet but that's the
chaNCE YOU TAKE  WHEN  COMING to the gig cold and if you don't speak up
before the gig beginsa

try kerouac and zoot sims  al cohn and try my cd w/daniel  and sabir  and
other saxophonists  when it works with  sax or other musicians  it's
heaven and like i said when it fails it fails miserably tho most won't
admit that.

and when one learns after awhile to compensate vocally w/ a good sound
system or hearty voice  ( and i'm not talking performance here ) well
anything goes  and come down to bpc  tues the 23rd  and hear a bunch of
us read with amram  ok it ain't no sax but hey french horns flutes etc
miraculous the way he accompanies the words  as all great musicians do
when they realize the voice speaking is like the voice singing  leider

if they play as i term it below the level of hearing  or on a par or
listen  w/give and take wow   what else  can i say  wow  tho i will agree
w/one thing  sax can be the hardest if the player  plays too loud     ah
i'm  rambling  good night all

and what doe you mean daniel is one of the few improvisers who make it a
respectable form  ?  i really resent that  ...   i can name you shit
without exaggeration  50 or more w/out even trying  maybe 100
maybe.......ach  who are you anyhow?  who do you listen to musically  or
poetically?  ach  ach   ach  that's why these musicians struggle  even
sometimes more than  poets do to get by  ach  achhh   achhhhhhhhhhhhh
this has been an improvised message from  achhhhhhhhh

Hi all,

I'm still looking to add one more non-NY small press for Thurs. Feb. 3 to
our d.a. levy lives series.

Below is my post from a short time ago, which tells you a bit about the
series. You can email me to editor@boogcity.com if you are interested in
having your press take part or know of a press you think I should pursue.

as ever,
david

Hi all,

The first year of our non-NY Small Press series--d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press--has gone real well. We were honored to
present readings from:

Meritage Press (San Francisco/St. Helena, Calif.),
The Owl Press (Woodacre, Calif.)
Avec Books (Penngrove, Calif.)
CyPress (Cincinnati, Ohio)
above/ground press (Ottawa, Canada)
Chax Press (Tucson, Arizona)
Carve (Boston)
Braincase Press (Northampton, Mass.)
Combo (Providence, Rhode Island)
Talon Books (Vancouver, British Columbia)

The readings are on the first Thursday of each month at ACA Galleries at 529
W.20th St., 5th Flr. (bet. 10th and 11th avenues) at 6:00 p.m., and usually
feature contributors from a press reading for 20-30 minutes and a musical
act performing for 15-20 minutes, a break, and then 20-30 minutes more of
readings and 15-20 minutes more of music.

The gallery operators are amazing folk and connected to the poetry community
in that they're the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik. They
provide wine and other beverages, cheese, and fruit for each reading, too.
Oh yeah, no door either.

Adeena  - your site is indeed beautiful  and you have some fascintating work
there. Hope your event goes well.

As to reading with musicians I have done so and often its a shambles - for
me the word/the voice is better by itself...but if I was in NY I would go.
( I have to go by subway or taxi). But NZ is a bit far !!

Actually I read my own stuff at the Nuyorican and couple of other places in
1993.  The scene is certainly full on over there. Mind you I was drunk every
night for about 2 1/2 weeks - NY blew me away and to read I used to drink
heavily.... drn to use Harry's mantra...drnnn....drnn...drn.....

Nowadays I stay clear of readings .....  danger points for me......long
story but -

Blesed are those who can control their drinking. Used to think of them as
"wowsers".

(NZ term of contempt for non drinkers) ....

Extra - What is a "homo linguistic translation" - a "same langauge
translation" reading?  Is Sefir an Israeli - that means you are translating
from Hebrew?

You should also read your own work - I feel - lol.

Thoughts of an old dry brain......drn  (sorry Harry!)

Thanks, Steve.

As you know, and a few others on the list know, I read poetry with bands
that included saxophones for many years. When the saxophonist is riding with
your words instead of taking his own solo without regard for them, it's a
beautiful experience. The instrument twines around your words, filling your
breath spaces with a sympathetic, twining texture. I lead a poetry band for
5 years in which I played bass, and a duet with saxophonist-flutist Thomas
Chapin. The two saxophonists were right there, in synch with what I was
doing. Tom, in particular, could read my mind, or close to it. One
saxophonist I used only a few times needed to be taught that continually
playing 8-measure 16th note phrases kept me from getting the words of the
poem into the performance; a saxophonist has to play in a way that lets you
breathe.

A lot of poetry read with music just doesn't work; either the musicians
aren't listening to the poet, or the poet doesn't have the rhythmic sense
that enables him to interact with the musicians. I always felt mine worked
best when I played bass in the band; from the bass chair I could control the
tempos, and keep the band moving in the direction I wanted it to move. A
poet who doesn't play in the band has a harder time of it; he needs to
direct the musicians or find musicians who are in synch with him---as Steve
says, a musician who recognizes the voice is another instrument in the band.
Steve knows what he's talking about; he recites with a musician's timing.
It's something I do as well. Reciting with music lifts my recitation to
another level. The textures fill up the space I leave on the page, create a
sense of "being in the world" instead of a solo voice trying to levitate the
audience on its own steam. The music supplies the power one person alone
can't, and give the recitation a backup that makes it more powerful, when
done properly.

A reading of the Kabbalah with sensitive musicians could be a very powerful
experience.

There's my 2 cents.

Subject: Re: Kabbalah Reading at St. Marks Dec. 3- sax oh phony shit

this is really sad  have you ever read  with a sax player?  well i have
they can be too loud and get in the way because they are like another
voice  or like daniel  joe mcphee many others i've read with be an equal
voice . suspicious of what? what are you suspicious of? or is that just a
figure of speech  Music and poetry as a combo?  just sax and voice  what?
 you've hit a nerve there my boy  you sound like you know daniel and his
work  so you should be aware of how respectful he can be if he needs too
or is asked to
i read with him on two occasions  where he was too damned respectful  and
on other occassions where i had to scream or keep quiet but that's the
chaNCE YOU TAKE  WHEN  COMING to the gig cold and if you don't speak up
before the gig beginsa

try kerouac and zoot sims  al cohn and try my cd w/daniel  and sabir  and
other saxophonists  when it works with  sax or other musicians  it's
heaven and like i said when it fails it fails miserably tho most won't
admit that.

and when one learns after awhile to compensate vocally w/ a good sound
system or hearty voice  ( and i'm not talking performance here ) well
anything goes  and come down to bpc  tues the 23rd  and hear a bunch of
us read with amram  ok it ain't no sax but hey french horns flutes etc
miraculous the way he accompanies the words  as all great musicians do
when they realize the voice speaking is like the voice singing  leider

if they play as i term it below the level of hearing  or on a par or
listen  w/give and take wow   what else  can i say  wow  tho i will agree
w/one thing  sax can be the hardest if the player  plays too loud     ah
i'm  rambling  good night all

and what doe you mean daniel is one of the few improvisers who make it a
respectable form  ?  i really resent that  ...   i can name you shit
without exaggeration  50 or more w/out even trying  maybe 100
maybe.......ach  who are you anyhow?  who do you listen to musically  or
poetically?  ach  ach   ach  that's why these musicians struggle  even
sometimes more than  poets do to get by  ach  achhh   achhhhhhhhhhhhh
this has been an improvised message from  achhhhhhhhh

and with the Sefer Yetzirah, make them into
beautiful trees. (Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananya, 1st C.)


The Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation also known as Book of the Letters) is
the "oldest and most mysterious" of all Kabbalistic texts and dates back to 100
BCE.  Originally transmitted in Aramaic as an Oral Teaching, was transcribed
and bound into a Hebrew text, translated into German, Italian and eventually
English. Today, it exists in fragments, residues - a network of echoes, traces
of versions layered upon versions that point to the ghostly remnants of an
inaccessible / impossible origin. This homo(r)phonic trans-elation of the first
chapter moves through and across  an intra-lingual, cultural and geo-poetic
terrain, and through a process of `homage and parricide', attempts to pay
allegiance to this cryptic history.

The focus of the Sefer Yetzirah is on the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet
(how they were formed, how they inter-relate, how they make meaning). The text
itself is inscribed through slippage, elision, rupture and undecidability, and
language is foregrounded as "a continuum of letters", names, mathematical
equations, gates of meaning.

One of the reasons I chose this text was that I find it fascinating how the
Sefer Yetzirah, as a religious doctrine, is lodged firmly in a metaphysical
tradition - yet with its focus on letters, language, on meaning production, the
"meta" (beyond) becomes an linguistic space, an intervening space, a place of
syncretism, juxtaposition and integration.  Through this translative praxis, I
was interested in carving out ways in which this text could be dislodged from
a socio-religious and historically-limiting hermeneutic (not mired within an
onto-theologically insulated discourse validated by transcendency), but rather
could be reviewed as a polyglossic textual arena without specific meaning and
heterogenous to all hermeneutic totalization.

Thus, through a process of recombination and permutation of letters, sounds,
rhythms, textures, this translation (or "transluc-nacion") enacts (or puts
into play) a Kabbalistic hermeneutic whereby there is an audible reverberation of
the various languages, histories, codes - that enfold into each other, caress
each other, speak to each other.

By a slight displacement by slipping one word in beneath another, it seems to
mimic Nietzche's Geschichte eines Irrtum (History of an Error) announcing the
narration of a fabrication: "how the true world finally becomes a fable" - a
fabrication that produces precisely, nothing other than the idea of a true
world - which risks hijacking the supposed truth of the narration.

For this translation, i used the Gra Version (which in its totality contains
6 chapters and consists of about 1800 words). i have aimed to maintain all
orthographic accoutrement of the original text: line spacing, capitalization,
commas, periods and quotation marks.

In the beginning there was repetition, reproduction. translation.

Hi Mary Jo

Thanks for sending this. "to be or not to b" says a lot that's true of the
Kerouac we know through the biographies. I don't have Memory Babe down here
& haven't read it since it came out. Out of context, the quote seems a
little harsh. Kerouac lived a life whose extreme contradictions tore him
apart, very true. But Kerouac's hardly the first writer to say life is an
art & then to write about it instead of live it. Henry Miller did it all the
time. No matter what they say, though, writers are writers and they live the
"art" of their lives as writers, not as everyday people.

I posted this poem and comment awhile ago at another group and thought you
might enjoy it. Too lazy to edit much. Too much alliteration. I think the

is from 'Memory Babe.'

Jack Kerouac set out to be the best American writer that ever lived, but he
didn't know how to live. Instead he filled his life with excessive friends
and
experiences - like a Pollack painting, a frenzy. He was forever traumatized
by
the childhood death of his brother Gerard who said that dying and going to
heaven was the best thing ever. When Jack innocently and joyfully announced
Gerard's death to his family, they were horrified, and so it began. His life
became a morality play of this very philosophical paradox.

"His final point - is to suggest that life completely perceived is poetry,
is
art, and needs no labor of pen, brush, or anything else to make it so: 'Of
course there's someplace to go! Go mind your own business.' Again Kerouac
affirms the nobility of silence; it is more honest than talk, and the only
cure for
vanity. But since he failed to keep that silence himself at a point where it
was called for - his life going farther out of kilter even as his art
approached an ideal serenity - there is nothing more for him to say but
'Forget it,
wifey. Go to sleep. Tomorrow's another day."

FYI:  The original source article on Salon.com gives additional context:

Watch Bush's "one-fingered victory salute"
Back when he was Texas governor, the president sassed Karen Hughes big
time, and the cameras caught him.

Oct. 27, 2004  |  You heard him call New York Times reporter Adam
Clymer a "major league asshole" back during the 2000 campaign. Now
watch President Bush -- back when he was Texas governor -- salute
loyal advisor Karen Hughes on video, with his middle finger.

You can watch the video here
<http://anon.salon.speedera.net/anon.salon/media/2004/10/BushUncensored.mov>.
Salon obtained the video from Texans for Truth, an Austin-based
advocacy group that's kept the heat on Bush about his missing time in
the Texas Air National Guard. Texans for Truth is also hosting the
video on its site.

According to the group's sources, the segment was part of a video
session shot while Bush was governor. The clip shows him smoothing his
hair for the camera, complaining about an off-camera aide believed to
be Hughes. "She's still tellin' me what to do," he says, before he
flashes his middle finger. As worried aides murmur about whether the
camera's running, Bush dismisses his gesture as a "one-fingered
victory salute."

There's nothing wrong with a little playful obscenity among friends,
but our preacher in chief has worked hard to hide the smirking frat
boy within. The video isn't likely to energize the evangelical base
the White House cares about most.

Has anyone heard Joy Harjo use her saxophone as part of her reading
performance?  Beautiful soundings.  Especially with her native american accompanists on
drums and more.  Don't know whether she has recordings, or on line, but
likely.

This is the title of a recording (on Paratactile records) by
Derek Bailey (guitarist) playing and reciting the poetry of Lyn
Hejinian, Peter Riley and yes Steve Dalachinsky.  A little
different than a duet situation with poet and reed player.  I
really like Steve's piece in that and the way Derek deals with
it.

Bailey's playing/reading is pretty interesting and i like what
he's doing.  Any more of that out there? Or recordings by other
artists anyone could recommend?

(Steve Lacey's work Irene Aebi (his wife) was great, to name one
other player whom i've heard who makes it respectably.)

Dear friends and family:

On NPR's Morning Edition, Nina Tottenberg said that if the Supreme Court
supports Congress, it will, in effect, be the end of the National Public
Radio (NPR), National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) &the Public Broadcasting
System (PBS). PBS, NPR and the arts are facing major cutbacks in funding. In
spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and streamline
their services, some government officials believe that the funding currently
going to these programs is too large a portion of funding for something
which is seen as not worthwhile. This is for anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a
worthwhile expenditure of   $1.12/year of their taxes. The only way that our
representatives can be aware of the base of support for PBS and funding for
these types of programs is by making our voices heard.

 Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends who believe in
what this stands for. This list will be forwarded to the President and the
Vice President of the United  States. This petition is being passed around
the Internet. Please add your name to it so that funding can be maintained
for NPR, PBS, & the NEA.

  HOW TO SIGN & FORWARD: IT'S EASY: Please keep this petition rolling. Do
not reply to me. Please sign and forward to others to sign. If you prefer
not to sign, please send to the E-mail address indicated below.

  DON'T WORRY ABOUT DUPLICATES. This is being forwarded to several people at
once to add their names to the petition. It won't matter if many people
receive the same list as the names are being managed. This is for anyone who
thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure of $1.12/year of their taxes. A
petition follows.

  If you sign, please forward on to others. If not, please don't kill it.
Send it to the Email address listed here: wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu

  If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250t h, etc., signer of this
petition, please forward a copy to the above address. This way we can keep
track of the lists and organize them. Forward this to everyone you know, and
help us to keep these programs alive.

  Thank you!

  NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT (highlight) the entirety of this
letter and then COPY it into a new outgoing message, rather than simply
forwarding it. In your new outgoing message, add your name to the bottom of
the list, then send it on.

the rebel doesn't save the world
he makes a world
his own
he doesn't collect
he connects
the points of light
within his own darkness
then he burns down
his own house
tears out the foundation
that someone else built
he establishes his own
who knows who
will come to visit

Thanks. I've usually been quite vigilant about e-petitions etc. but since
this came from someone who usually knows better, I hadn't given it a second
thought.

Apologies listees.

Sestina -  the Ultimate Pornography

This is the ultimate pornography
and I see them, bending to read
or clicking to watch the latest me
come, touch my wounds, feel
the parts I no longer can
dance in the death of the light.

Hey, he said, you gotta light?
So I says, Look, I'm inta pornography
& all but I don't know if we can
get away with this, I mean I read
somewheres & I dunno how I feel
about it... but he just sez Look on me

Ye mighty, & etc. Little old me
appearing in a not very good light
I'm afraid, but what did I feel
while doing it, those pornographic
prisoners splayed out, I only read
the articles, haha, while sitting on the can.

Oh, it's cool, I mean, I can
dig it, like, out there all alone, 'me
so horny,' easy to read
on bitch's face she wants it, light
her up, bang! Pornography?
What da hell's that, you feel?

But let me tell how numb I feel.
Thankful for the beating - can
you understand? Sex in pornography
is not love, is not even sex. This is me
shouting back at them, almost light-
hearted, demanding my sentence be read.

It's true - no one can read
the writing on this wall, feel
what there is to feel, light
at the end of - who can
say? No you & no me
only a looker and looked at: Pornography.

Don't you fuckin' look at me. Read
your paper and walk if you can, feel
your way through this pornography of shadow and
light.


THE REACH OF WAR: HOSTAGES; Captive Turk in Iraq
Tells Of Fearful Struggle to Live
By SUSAN SACHS (NYT) 1513 words
Published: September 24, 2004
http://query.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article
?res=FB0713F73A5D0C778EDDA00894DC404482

Perhaps the words were meant to be reassuring
after the blindfold and the guns at her back. But
for Zeynep Tugrul, a young Turkish journalist held
hostage in northern Iraq, her captor's calm
statement was as comforting as bathing in ice.
''Please understand why we have to make sure who
you are,'' said the man who had seemed so
friendly, the one everyone called the emir, or
leader. ''There have been lots of spies here, and
we had to cut their heads off.''


Ms. Tugrul, a diplomatic affairs correspondent
with the daily newspaper Sabah, was freed last
week by Iraqi kidnappers after four days of terror
and hope, surviving the double pressure of arguing
for her own life while trying to protect a
Canadian colleague.

She and Scott Taylor, the publisher of a military
affairs magazine in Canada, spent most of their
captivity together in the northern Iraqi towns of
Tal Afar and Mosul, and in desert shantytowns in
between. After being handed from one group of
captors to another, they were separated on Sept.
11, the day of her unexpected and unexplained
release. Mr. Taylor was let go the next day.

As captives, she said, they discussed death
impassively.

''I would say, 'Let's kill each other,''' Ms.
Tugrul said. ''And Scott would say, 'Don't let
them kill me blindfolded. And tell my son I didn't
cry and that I was strong.'

''And then I'd tell him, 'You come and stand in
front of me before I die, because I don't want the
last person I see to be somebody I don't know.'''

. . .

The Arab men wrapped a red and white scarf around
her face, so tightly that she thought she would go
blind. They led her to a hallway and started
beating her. It was only then, she said, that she
realized how numb she had become.

''I know it sounds strange,'' she said, ''but I
was happy at that moment because at least I could
feel my body. I felt like I was coming back to
myself.''

''Your friend has confessed everything!'' the men
shouted. ''Are you ready to confess?''

She yelled back, ''We came here for you, to get
your story, so I've got no words to say to people
like you.''

''And that was when they got really angry,'' she
continued. ''But you know, that was the real me.''

Picking up on the notion of "homolinguistic translations" - for those
familiar with my work -  I am very sympathetic to "reverential hijackings"
whether linguistic or acoustic. Of the latter, I have always like the
various (from ironic, to rebellious to mega-sentimental) jazz improvs on
Broadway musical and Tin-Pan Alley pop standards. (Whether by Ellington,
Ornette Colman, Coltrane, etc.) Much of it is done in the spirit of
'cleaning it up and making it more real' to make it respond in a fresh way
to the contemporary circumstance of the artist(s) and the time.

What seems coming up at St. Marks,  a re-chipping away at Hebrew letters,
seems also in that same spirit - giving the original work a contemporary
rebirth out of what may now read as ancient shackles - where the text has
become an obligation rather than a liberating force.

I suspect, on a broader level, many of us are constantly hijacking the goods
- say high modernist poets -  from the protectors in order to shake the work
out & give it a new ride. Which is not to say there is not a level of
respect to the process. More - as I see it - it is a way of honoring some of
our progenitors and letting old stuff rebirth anew.  (Barry Watten's recent
dialogs with Kenneth Fearing I find an interesting approach to this, as
well.)

Certainly that's been my own on-going experience of making 'antonymical
translations' of  Zukofsky's "A", Ann Carson's translations of Sappho, and
further back, the work of Fanny Howe. I appreciate riding and taking off
from those shoulders.

on the lighter side:
extra special bonus points to anyone who
a) actually reads this
b) can tell what poem it's based on


Idiot Wind
or
The Fall of the Yankees
a fragment

High in the hazy vastness of a suite
far above the riff-raff baseball fans
far from spring and his team's quick start
sat the white-haired Boss, ears oozing steam,
still as the desolate Gotham night.
The chant "Who's your Daddy?" rung in his head
like the Shot Heard 'Round the World. No cigar
smoke
filled the air with victory's smell, no shortstop
robbed a basehit skimming o'er the grass,
but where the last ball fell, there did it rest.
A plane droned overhead, louder still
by reason of the awkward silence
choking the room; the janitor retreated,
pulling the door closed with an apologetic click.

Over the plush carpet large high heels stepp'd,
but paused like rabbits in tall grass, afraid
to break the spell. Upon the desk the hand
that signed the checks twitched once and died,
unshaken; and his rheumy eyes were glazed;
while his bobble head rocked back and forth,
and a bit of drool trickled from his lip.

It seemed unwise to rouse him from this state;
better to let the idiot wind blow and fade
than to stand naked before it; but timidly
the intern passed a hand before George's face.
She was a traveling secretary.
By her wizardry men arrived
precisely at all hours in distant towns;
in her mind timetables swam like sweet
music; at her whim doormen jumped, cabs
swerved, planes touched down on oily tarmacs.
But Oh! no one hustled for her now, no wheels
were set in motion, the team bus sat cold
in some Bronx garage; now all that sped
was her sad heart, all else come to rest.
As if machinery had just shut down;
as if the vast thing had ground to a halt
screeching and clicking, and her sullen tear
was its last drop of oil spilling out.
One hand she pressed upon that glowing spot
where her cell phone flashed, as if its red light,
reminder of what was gone, pierced her side.
With the other she probed for a pulse on
George's stiffened neck, and leaning low, spoke
into his red and ringing ear, her voice
exploding with a harsh Brooklyn tone.
Some well-meant words, to be sure, and would that
we had been there to report, verbatim, what
she says; alas, we must but paraphrase:

"George, wake up! Snap out of it, you old fool!
It's better to lose and win than to win
and lose, and that is all the comfort left
to us now, cold though it may be. Think of
1991, when Isiah led his team
off the court like a child indignantly
stomping out of a playroom after Jordan
had ended their reign; remember Dean
screaming into the mike just last year, his
campaign
run aground on the reef of his own anger;
most of all, think of the free agents out there,
the Beltrans and the Pavanos, the Radkes
and, yes, even sweet Pedro, who could be
yours for a song. What I mean, Georgie, is
there's still time to snatch from defeat this
little victory, but you must hurry;
Image is Everything. Seize the future
in the instant, get out in front of this
wave and ride it, till you are safely past
the storm; buck up and act your millions, sir."

As when in the second game of a twi-night
doubleheader, the whole crowd is worn down
to a dull murmur, yet the sight of a certain
player stealing a basehit in the hole
or racing to beat out an infield dribbler
rouses their dampened spirits, wringing
from them one last ecstatic roar,
so her speech scorched his heart. Then she sighed
and fell back on the couch, checking to see
who'd called; finally free, there was a hotel
in Tahoe where an old flame waited...
Outside the window, on a little ledge,
pigeons met and mated, then flung themselves
into the dark sky. Yet still this pair sat
like the statues in Monument Park,
the Boss comatose behind his desk,
the intern impatient yet frozen
in place. Till at last the king came to,
shook his wizened mane like a man shocked back
to life, noticed the old dusty trophies
in their case, the empty spot for the next
sore as a pulled tooth; then saw the woman
and as one just learning the language, spoke:

"You insolent little wench, how dare you
interrupt my reverie, burst in here
telling me which stars to sign-
        --Get out of here! You're fired! But
wait; you're a woman; do I look older
to you than I did - is my hair - I mean
I know I'm growing old... I don't understand.
We won! We snatched A-Rod out from under
them, signed Vasquez over Schilling, gave a cool
20 mill to Kevin Brown... they guaranteed
victory! Now my empire's dashed like
peanut shells. I feel the worm that felled
Giambi twist in my gut. Let me tell
you a story: When I was just 13
my parents gave me money to go to
Coney Island with my best friend, Peter
Jones. Saturday night we dashed out dreaming
of cotton candy, the Tilt-a-Whirl, all
those rickety old rides, their neon splashed
like fireworks in our racing brains, racing
to beat the agonizing trains that took us
there - this was Autumn 1942 -
the night crisp with leaves the color of warm
jewels on New York's pallid throat, ruby
and amber hues pasted to the sky. And
when the doors opened at last we rushed
out to - nothing. No rides, no candy, no
screams carried momentarily to our
ears like light from a guttering flame.
No. The park was closed up for the year.
Instead we bought soggy hotdogs and wandered
to the boardwalk, dark by now, then to the end
of the piers where old men dipped rods
in the Atlantic, loitering
out of season. For Jones the disappointment
thickened an already despondent nature
to the point of comic suicide; for me
it merely stiffened my resolve. Never
to be caught off-guard, never left out
in the cold. That night I steeled my heart for
the bitter struggle of all that lied ahead."

The Aeron chair flew back; the Boss rose like
Liston from the mat, shaking off the jolt
of a staggering blow, bloodied but on
his feet for the next round, oblivious to
the secretary who quietly chatted
with her lover. "Get Cashman on the horn!
Whither Torre? Can't I buy another
championship? Quick - I want to pore
over statistics, look at averages,
E.R.A's - Who IS your Daddy? (At this
the Boss paused and caught his image mirrored
in trophy's gleam.) The intern leaped up
and slapped an awkward high-five in George's
outstretched hand, then talked a mile a minute:

"Yes! You've saved the House that Ruth Built..."

[to be continued...]

folklorists who study urban legend call these foaftales (friend of a
friend tales).

this personal connection works to ground the urban myth in some sort of
authenticity. so, "a woman who works with my aunt went down to Florida and
picked up some guy at the pool. when she woke up, scrawled in lipstick on
the hotel room mirror in red lipstick, was -Welcome to the world of AIDS".
That's a popular one that comes around every spring break season.

The cookie recipe one will start making th rounds soon. just in time for
christmas.

There is a journal devoted to foaftales out of Memorial University of
Newfoundland. not sure if it is on-line though.

cheers,
kevin

greetings folks

watching the fandango from this green offshore colony, reminds that it is a
poet's job to melt the armour of the sense-less, petrified robots, one drop
at a time.  while those who are open-to-change bikker about the shape of
butterflies (and moon at the deep group depression), there's work to be

human-ness... thus, for the hard of hearing we might shout...

poisoned cup
by andrew lovatt

hunger & thirst
despair & desire
lust & necessity
how you circle us
with your sweet
poisoned cup

our souls deflated
run out by prosperity
fast food & popcorn
tv with happy endings
how could we not
be grateful for your war

you raise our lust
with promises
of the blackest enemies
in your klieg light
we can appear
to have halos

comforted by your brand
an illusion of reason
sold as a lifestyle choice
the two burger democracy
of satisfied desires
leaves us hungrier

we will pretend being
who others appear to be
so that our consciences
sleep soundly in their beds
thirsting for more like
dry mouthed expectants

Dear Steve D, or achhhhhh,

you shouldn't take offense at my insinuation about improv not being
respectable. For one, it was the kind of vicissitudinal opinion intended for
a personal friend, not a listserve composed mainly of people I don't know
personally -- as I wrote, it was sent here by accident, and I had a feeling
it would cause some misunderstanding. Though I do think my feelings on such
matters have at least a smidgeon of import, as I have in fact done the
poetry + music thing quite a bit -- and from both sides. From age 8 I was
trained as a musician, first on violin, then guitar, and then cello. When I
decided to quit formal training at 20 I played improv almost exclusively,
performing many times w/ various poets, dancers, etc. But I got pretty burnt
out after a few years, and was frustrated with the various improv circles I
went thru (all west coast), and exhausted with the form as whole. I still
am. When I started focusing on poetry -- alas, I am one of those unfortunate
ones who gave up music for poetry -- when I tell poets this, most respond w/
"WHY?!!" -- I read w/ musicians a few times, seemed a natural enough
transition. While I have had a few good experiences, I've found it's really
not my kind of thing. That's all. But I do agree w/ Vernon Frazer that the
combination of the sounds of the Sefir Yatserah and good musicians could be
incredible. Wish I could be there. But I am still weary of probably most
poetry + music combos/events/etc., because a lot of poets are not good
musicians and can't transition well into the world of sound (for that
matter, this is a problem of poetry readings in general). But this says
nothing about your (or Karasick's) work with musicians. I'm not familiar
with it. Maybe it would rock my world. Who knows.

Maybe this doesn't answer any of your questions. Don't be sad.

"How are we to understand and attain the knowledge of the present time?"
Kia Lindroos asks at the very beginning of her study of Benjamin.

[1943]

"The maquis put the flag on the bridge and sent round to the mayor to
tell the town crier that the bridge was in the hands of the maquis and
nobody should cross it, then came the night, the maquis gathered from
all sides attacked the fleeing Germans and killed anywhere from fifty to
eighty of them in the marshes, the nephew of our baker killed five and
the butcher boy killed four, the Germans were trying to escape toward
Aix-les-Bains, but there others of the maquis pushed them back and it
became a regular rabbit drive..." (Stein 235).

"I think of the Americans of the last war, they had their language but
they were not yet in possession of it, and the children of the
depression as that generation called itself it was beginning to possess
its language but it was still struggling but now the job is done, the
G.I. Joes have this language that is theirs, they do not have to worry
about it, they dominate their language and in dominating their language
which is now all theirs they have ceased to be adolescents and have
become men" (Stein 259).

[2004]

In the 17.11.04 Le Monde translation the space between two languages can
be seen: "Sur l'enregistrement, on peut entendre un marine faire
remarquer en entrant dans les lieux qu'un homme respire encore. "He's
fucking faking he's dead" ("Cet enculé fait semblant d'être mort"),
dit-il. "Oui, il respire", répond un autre marine. "He's faking he's
fucking dead!", répète le premier marine."

[1940-1960]

In the Tenth Prelude of Introduction to Modernity, "Renewal, Youth,
Repetition," Henri Lefebvre mentions another space: "the gulf between
'what is happening', the event for which no one can foresee the
consequences, and the time when everyone knows 'what really happened',
when the consequence is plain to see." Lefebvre writes that this gap is
widening, which he attributes to "a somewhat superficial interest in
history, and the distortion of the immediate historical past" (162).

Reading "On the Concept of History," Lindroos writes: "Benjamin turns to
the idea of 'showing', as opposed to narrating history [...] 'Ich habe
nichts zu sagen, nur zu zeigen.'" (PW 574). She sees this quote pointing
in two directions, not only back towards the baroque but towards our own
time, "the end of the 20th century, in which events have become
increasingly visual, although at this point rather through technical
means than by allegoric images" (93).

[17.11.04]

To relate the English "now all theirs" of Stein's G.I. Joes to the
interpretive problem posed by the audio-visual information conveying the
vernacular force - "in dominating" - of one's native tongue accompanying
the (edited) view of a war crime would be to locate the wider context,
hearing in the soldier's words recorded in the Mosque the superficial
history or worse, the failure of language and imagination in Stein's
Wars I Have Seen:

"The uncritical reception of tradition implies a problem, which is
transferred into a 'truth' of this heritage, and is conceived of as
temporally stable and non-transformable. Here, the idea of the
redemption of a situation means liberating historical heritage from its
continuity and stability (GS 1: 1242)" (Lindroos 56).

[27.02.91]

"'The lead company behind us is tearing up all those vehicles,' someone
tells battalion headquarters as the recording begins....

Allen reports on Ware's battalion net, 'There's shooting, but there's no
one there' -- no combatants -- 'to shoot at.' Ware answers, 'I
understand,' and then asks a series of operational questions about maps.

Later, Manchester asks Allen, 'Sir, what element is firing behind us?'

Allen: 'I have no fucking idea.'

An unidentified Scout asks, 'Why are we shooting at these people when
they are not shooting at us?'

Brasfield: 'They want to surrender.... Fucking armored vehicles [the
Bradleys]. They don't have to blow them apart.'

Sporadic firing continues. Someone asks Allen, 'Why don't you tell them,
sir, that they are willing to surrender. Tell 'em that.' Someone else
says, amid the noise, 'It's murder.'

Ware is on the radio when someone says, 'We shot the guys we had
gathered up.' Another voice interjects, 'They didn't have no weapons.'
Ware calls for all firing to stop and then asks another question about
routine battalion procedures.

'He heard it; he knew it,' Sergeant Mulig told me later, speaking of
Ware. 'But it didn't register.'"

Is Aldon Nielson out of commission? (I actually tried to email him a week or
so ago with no response). Or Maria Damon. But I suspect they are variously
good authorities on the discography of collaborations of particularly
African American poets and musicians, including Sax players. (As would be
Nathaniel Mackey, who I don't think is on this list)
In addition to Spoken Word stuff, the seventies and eighties were full of
interesting combinations of musicians from Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago and
the West working in New York with poets at the Tin Palace and Public Theater
among other venues. (A little example that comes to mind re the Sax is David
Murray's work with Ntozake Shange to whom he was briefly married).

Did Bev Harris Catch Vote Fraud Perpetrators in The Act?

by Thom Hartmann =A0

There was something odd about the poll tapes.

A "poll tape" is the phrase used to describe a printout from an optical=20=

scan voting machine made the evening of an election, after the machine=20=

has read all the ballots and crunched the numbers on its internal=20
computer. It shows the total results of the election in that location.=20=

The printout is signed by the polling officials present in that=20
precinct/location, and then submitted to the county elections office as=20=

the official record of how the people in that particular precinct had=20
voted. (Usually each location has only one single optical=20
scanner/reader, and thus produces only one poll tape.)

Bev Harris of www.blackboxvoting.org, the erstwhile investigator of=20
electronic voting machines, along with people from Florida Fair=20
Elections, showed up at Florida's Volusia County Elections Office on=20
the afternoon of Tuesday, November 16, 2004, and asked to see, under a=20=

public records request, each of the poll tapes for the 100+ optical=20
scanners in the precincts in that county. The elections workers -=20
having been notified in advance of her request - handed her a set of=20
printouts, oddly dated November 15 and lacking signatures.

Bev pointed out that the printouts given her were not the original poll=20=

tapes and had no signatures, and thus were not what she'd requested.=20
Obligingly, they told her that the originals were held in another=20
location, the Elections Office's Warehouse, and that since it was the=20
end of the day they should meet Bev the following morning to show them=20=

to her.

Bev showed up bright and early the morning of Wednesday the 17th - well=20=

before the scheduled meeting - and discovered three of the elections=20
officials in the Elections Warehouse standing over a table covered with=20=

what looked like poll tapes. When they saw Bev and her friends, Bev=20
told me in a telephone interview less than an hour later, "They=20
immediately shoved us out and slammed the door."

In a way, that was a blessing, because it led to the stinking evidence.

"On the porch was a garbage bag," Bev said, "and so I looked in it and,=20=

and lo and behold, there were public record tapes."

Thrown away. Discarded. Waiting to be hauled off.

"It was technically stinking, in fact," Bev added, "because what they=20
had done was to have thrown some of their polling tapes, which are the=20=

official records of the election, into the garbage. These were the ones=20=

signed by the poll workers. These are something we had done an official=20=

public records request for."

When the elections officials inside realized that the people outside=20
were going through the trash, they called the police and one came out=20
to challenge Bev.

Kathleen Wynne, a www.blackboxvoting.org investigator, was there.

"We caught the whole thing on videotape," she said. "I don't think=20
you'll ever see anything like this - Bev Harris having a tug of war=20
with an election worker over a bag of garbage, and he held onto it and=20=

she pulled on it, and it split right open, spilling out those poll=20
tapes. They were throwing away our democracy, and Bev wasn't going to=20
let them do it."

As I was interviewing Bev just moments after the tussle, she had to get=20=

off the phone, because, "Two police cars just showed up."

She told me later in the day, in an on-air interview, that when the=20
police arrived, "We all had a vigorous debate on the merits of my=20
public records request."

The outcome of that debate was that they all went from the Elections=20
Warehouse back to the Elections Office, to compare the original,=20
November 2 dated and signed poll tapes with the November 15 printouts=20
the Elections Office had submitted to the Secretary of State. A camera=20=

crew from www.votergate.tv met them there, as well.

And then things got even odder.

"We were sitting there comparing the real [signed, original] tapes with=20=

the [later printout] ones that were given us," Bev said, "and finding=20
things missing and finding things not matching, when one of the=20
elections employees took a bin full of things that looked like garbage=20=

- that looked like polling tapes, actually - and passed by and=20
disappeared out the back of the building."

This provoked investigator Ellen Brodsky to walk outside and check the=20=

garbage of the Elections Office itself. Sure enough - more original,=20
signed poll tapes, freshly trashed.

"And I must tell you," Bev said, "that whatever they had taken out [the=20=

back door] just came right back in the front door and we said, 'What=20
are these polling place tapes doing in your dumpster?'"

A November 18 call to the Volusia County Elections Office found that=20
Elections Supervisor Deanie Lowe was unavailable and nobody was willing=20=

to speak on the record with an out-of-state reporter. However, The=20
Daytona Beach News (in Volusia County), in a November 17th article by=20
staff writer Christine Girardin, noted, "Harris went to the Department=20=

of Elections' warehouse on State Road 44 in DeLand on Tuesday to=20
inspect original Nov. 2 polling place tapes, after being given a set of=20=

reprints dated Nov. 15. While there, Harris saw Nov. 2 polling place=20
tapes in a garbage bag, heightening her concern about the integrity of=20=

voting records."

The Daytona Beach News further noted that, "[Elections Supervisor] Lowe=20=

confirmed Wednesday some backup copies of tapes from the Nov. 2=20
election were destined for the shredder," but pointed out that,=20
according to Lowe, that was simply because there were two sets of tapes=20=

produced on election night, each signed. "One tape is delivered in one=20=

car along with the ballots and a memory card," the News reported. "The=20=

backup tape is delivered to the elections office in a second car."

Suggesting that duplicates don't need to be kept, Lowe claims that=20
Harris didn't want to hear an explanation of why some signed poll tapes=20=

would be in the garbage. "She's not wanting to listen to an=20
explanation," Lowe told the News of Harris. "She has her own ideas."

But the Ollie North action in two locations on two days was only half=20
of the surprise that awaited Bev and her associates. When they compared=20=

the discarded, signed, original tapes with the recent printouts=20
submitted to the state and used to tabulate the Florida election=20
winners, Harris says a disturbing pattern emerged.

"The difference was hundreds of votes in each of the different places=20
we examined," said Bev, "and most of those were in minority areas."

When I asked Bev if the errors they were finding in precinct after=20
precinct were random, as one would expect from technical, clerical, or=20=

computer errors, she became uncomfortable.

"You have to understand that we are non-partisan," she said. "We're not=20=

trying to change the outcome of an election, just to find out if there=20=

was any voting fraud."

That said, Bev added: "The pattern was very clear. The anomalies=20
favored George W. Bush. Every single time."

Of course finding possible voting "anomalies" in one Florida county=20
doesn't mean they'll show up in all counties. It's even conceivable=20
there are innocent explanations for both the mismatched counts and=20
trashed original records; this story undoubtedly will continue to play=20=

out. And, unless further investigation demonstrates a pervasive and=20
statewide trend toward "anomalous" election results in many of=20
Florida's counties, odds are none of this will change the outcome of=20
the election (which exit polls showed John Kerry winning in Florida).

Nonetheless, Bev and her merry band are off to hit another county.

As she told me on her cell phone while driving toward their next=20
destination, "We just put Volusia County and their lawyers on notice=20
that they need to continue to keep a number of documents under seal,=20
including all of the memory cards to the ballot boxes, and all of the=20
signed poll tapes."

Why?

"Simple," she said. "Because we found anomalies indicative of fraud."

Subject:      THE HAMMER
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

(This was expanded from the original version, for possible inclusion in a
book. As I expanded, it made less and less sense to me, precisely as the
tools of analysis made less and less sense. One cannot argue with a
hammer.

The hammer is myself, the left, the right, all those divisions and
monologies which are increasingly senseless as the world goes on its
destructive path. As with many of us, I write to keep myself sane. As with
many of us, inscription, with all the phenomenology it implies, is close
to failure. - Alan)



THE HAMMER


Notes on the election in outline form, filled in, filled out, as if there
were an essay / a conclusion. (Since the early 70s, when I taught a course
called "The Year 3000," I always knew Kerry would lose. This is why.)

0. The Republican win was predicted and predictable. Now the infinity of
analysis begins, an infinity that has already missed the point. The point
is/was that demographics are all that are necessary - not tricks,
conundrums. The election was clear from the geography.

1. There is nothing the Democrats might have done 'better.' The country
voted its conscience. The country has a conscience, the conscience of the
Fatherland, Motherland. The conscience of a country is determined by its
constituents and their internal dynamics. This was not an election of
issues, but psychoanalytics.

2. Its conscience is founded on a morality-based worldview, which is rural
in origin, and relatively rigid. Worldviews are operational; with
widespread unemployment, relatively liberal media, Net information
explosion, increasing technological generation gaps, a rigid 'hedge around
the Torah' keeps good from evil, and separates genders, races, sexual
preferences, and others from selves. One keeps to the 'clean and proper
body' free of contagion, corrosion, decay from within. The rural landscape
is characterized by vast space and intensive information economies
(newspapers, radio, etc.) - in relation to church, grange, 4-h, other
communalities. The other is present by its absence.

3. 9/ll played a critical role, not only in revealing the extreme
vulnerability of the country, but also in the production of an Islamic-
fundamentalist alterity that could not be dismissed. Even in the
heartland, Islam is visible. New York City, the target, developed a
complex response within a mixed demographics; the heartland reaffirmed the
violence and contagion of the other.

4. With the religious right, fundamental ontology replaces the episteme.
What is contested is _not_ knowledge, its site/citation - but ontology
(not ontological issues) based on the fundamentalist belief in deity.
There is only one Book, Foucault's divine nature (divinatio) writ large in
its pages.

5. Bush appeared, alive and life-like at the World Trade Center ruins
almost immediately after, conjoining his image with the intensity of
destruction. One can relate this to the dynamics of post-traumatic-stress
syndrome; the two images are indissolubly linked.

6. The left continuously focused on the negative aspects of the Republican
party, over-determining, at least in print, the violence of a world-view
at odds with the rest of the planet. The left - by which I mean liberals
and anyone in an oppositional relationship to the Republican party -
remained unable to disseminate anything that would register in relation to
basic moral issues; instead it reacted to the implicit violence of the
right which insists on transcendent legislation within monotheistic
demands.

7. Absolute morality is not concerned whatsoever with opinion. It is a
fundamental structuring.

8. The right has been organizing, in the US, for at least a century and a
half; this election and the last have been in preparation for decades.
With the elimination of the 'fairness doctrine' under Reagan, and with
monopoly ownership of local broadcasting, the right has been able to
dominate the heartland without opposition. The corporate and Christian
merge, to the benefit of both. Think of it as a form of salesmanship: God
withholds and deploys.

9. In the 60s, which for many of us appears to be a history of the left,
the right quietly embraced both technology and structural compromises that
increased and solidified its power base, in rural and impoverished areas
of the country. Televangelism was one of the first institutionalized
ideological distribution systems. It remains coherent, organized, and
funded. Its base criss-crosses the United States, from rural to urban; it
plays in the disenfranchised.

10. A fundamental flaw is the assumption that so-called minority votes are
liberal and leftist; in fact, the opposite is increasingly the case. The
left operates, by and large, within a traditional view of labor and social
services; ideology, sexuality, and religion are kept out of the equation.

11. The 'American dream' is both part of class distinctions, and a force
in their elimination. Don't underrate its influence; no matter how hard we
try, there is no revolutionary class, but only power, desire, economic
status, and diffused and focused oppression. There is no class to the
extent that there are few class cultures; regional cultures cut across all
sorts of boundaries. Class identity is extremely fluid; it is no longer
(if it ever was) a lever for revolutionary action.

12. Corporate America is far more diverse and problematic than the left
assumes; it also presents a very real world of almost infinite choice and
identifications. Its collusions and corruptions are our collusions and
corruptions, and have absolutely nothing to do with God and God's State.
But in its withholding, its presentation of infinite longing, it allies
itself with religious fundamentalism.

13. Cultural capital in the US is far more important than economic
capital, and its boundaries cut across the latter in terms of class. We
are all white trash and we are all intellectuals and theorists. We are all
soccer moms, NASCAR dads, South Park Republicans, gold-standard hoarders,
participants in Amerikan cultural implosion. But this capital can be
rigidified, ordered, regulated; it is in collusion with the regulation of
the state and the regulation of the body. Hackers are not necessarily
harbingers of choice; it is too often their choice against others. The
country tends towards closure.

14. Far too many judgments are made 'for' rural and so-called back- water
areas, which are almost never heard themselves. The information discourse
networks and religious institutions of the majority of American voters are
concretely effaced by abstraction. The water of baptism is not H2O. The
left tends to ignore the internal coherency, cohesion, of the right -
which is heard only in mockery, satire, stereotype. There is no dialectic
at work in Amerika, and no indication that dialog would produce anything
but knee-jerk sloganeering.

15. Morality and fear are interwoven; it is the abject stereotyped image
of gays fucking that appears to corrode the 'clean and pure' body politic.
Your marriage wrecks my marriage. It is a failure of the left not to deal
with this; dismissing the violent imaginary out of hand ensures its force
within the political arena. In other words, what _you_ do hurts me; we are
all Christian, all one nation under God. _under_ God: literally in the
missionary position, fucked by God. God is the only legal, pure, fuck; it
makes all other fucks dangerous, perverse, intense and incandescent.

16. In conservative America, the negation of negation is not dialectical,
but also a return to a rapturous positivity. The elimination of the Other
is at the core of the Rapture. The Rapture does not disseminate; it
filters. The negation of negation _thuds._

17. If one's religion insists that abortion, for example, is murder, then
any means, including murder as literal self-preservation, may be used in
return as a defensive and pre-emptive action. It is not ever a question of
one side listening to another; it is a question of war to an infinite
degree. This waged by Good against Evil; it is the war pre-ordained in the
Book of Books, the testaments, sutras, Koran, classics. It is the war
which founds the configured and classical horizon of Aristotelian logic:
negation is not fuzzy, and the boundaries are drawn. Once drawn, anything,
any means of victory, is not only possible, but honorable, righteous.

18. The church in rural and disenfranchised America is a communal and
cohesive force, one of the few institutions capable of lived-community and
defense against the rest of the world. But more than this, the church is
also the locus for community activity and identity. To dismiss it, even in
its intolerant and sometimes evangelical varieties, is to miss the point
of its existence. For the individual, the church is salvation, explaining
and preserving morality, even forgiving and abetting the temptations of
sin.

19. The church overdetermines the rest of the world; rural and other- wise
isolated communities have a surprisingly low degree of information flux.
The church provides stability in a late-late-capitalist world of
postmodernity, where selves, ideologies, and languages are contested.
Within testament and testimony, there is no contestation; the church, in
other words, 'puts a hedge around the Torah' (Pirke Avot).

20. In my opinion, the image of Kerry hunting (and killing) was not only
hypocritical and distasteful, but also a premature sign of defeat.
However, this had no affect on the election per se, which was already
determined, way back in the late 60s and early 70s, when Billy Graham
created the first automated post-office in the US - a religious embrace of
technology that forecast the future of the country. Perhaps the left
'created' - i.e. the hacking manifesto - but the religious right utilized,
entrenched, constructed a primary embrace of individual and instrumental
reason that guaranteed the supple application of power when and where
needed. The only real question here is why it took so long.

21. The left has been hampered by split ideologies and critique; the
right, which permits no critique, has worked constantly with umbrella
ideologies. On the right: division beneath the sign of the absolute. On
the left: absolute division.

22. What has been exposed and contested in the US is often business as
usual in the rest of the world. We are witnessing a movement from republic
to empire, from the primacy of voting, to the primacy of dominant
interests. Lewinsky's stained dress? Entertainment serving political
impotency. O. J.? Politics as usual. Every case is the case of the
century. Empire and circuses. Dominant interests? Absolute ceiling of
transcendent God and capital, Capital.

23. On a personal level - I have lived in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and
the Bushlands of Texas and Florida. What happened was no surprise. I voted
early yesterday, and felt a sense of relief at the minor _punctum_ I
experienced. But I had no doubt that Bush would win, that my voice was
primarily personal therapeutic. Instead of despair late last night/this
morning, I've felt that our work, that of an opposition, has only just
begun - that it could only just begin. We have to recognize, above all,
that the US has done the will of the majority; the more we overlook this,
excuse this, theorize this, wonder 'what went wrong,' the more we are
weakened. Perhaps this is a positive sign - in the sense that the enemy,
if it is an enemy, is clear, and no longer can be dismissed as an
aberration.

24. The 'cultural war' is war. On our side: liberation, choice. On their
side: lack of choice, governance. On our side: Infinite taxation and
redistribution. On heir side: Zero taxation and centralization. On our
side? The devils that plague. On their side: service to God.

25. Terror is an instrument of war. Terror is an instrument of piece.
Terror is equivalent to sublimation. Terror is the wound that never heals.
Terror is Mini's scar in Dracula. Terror throws the abject up in our
faces. Terror constitutes closure against terror, against the abject.
Terror is the speech of God.

26. Religion sublimates terror. To believe in God is to believe in terror.
All difference becomes detour. Culture is detour, returning to the same
place. The place is the place of God. Culture is the hedge of God.

27. I live, you die. Vote or die holds no truck with the faithful. The
faithful live, do not die, die in order to live. Don't be deceived: The
faithful fuck each other, divorce at a furious rate, commit crimes of the
body, acts against and through the body, drugs and drinks coursing the
body, the course of the body. The overcoming of the curse and course of
the body is transcendence, the ultimate purity. I'm sorry, one good fuck
and we go to Heaven.

28. Language is not action. Belief is action. Belief is not language.
Theory talks itself to death. Academic theory rarely _acts_ from the
classroom - always safe PC stuff, even now. _To believe is to act. To
believe is not to speak, not to declare, attest, glossolalia._ Or these
are _acts of belief,_ not necessarily _speech acts._ Believe, _just
believe._

29. The explication of fact in Michael Moore is replaced by the
internalization of sin and the body in Mel Gibson. Old Testament, New
Testament. _One cannot argue with the wound._ It's like watching a drama,
someone getting kicked in the balls. As a viewer: _You feel it. They're
your balls._ Try and talk now!

30. What the right knows: There is always already closure. Try and talk
now!

Alan, I'm not going to quote a lot of it, but, your composition is
nothing but hate and contestation.

You seem to believe anyone who does not live in the city, under concrete
and pollution and big media in their face 24/7 (Alan Sondheim media) is
less than human. You clearly believe all God-fearing people should die
but you don't have the guts to come out-of-the-closet and explicitly say
it. You dance around all kinds of stuff while invariably shitting on
anything which doesn't meet your preferences. You revel in NYC. And you
take innate joy in driving Sondheim-fabricated wedges between the 'left'
and 'right' in an attempt to create fundamentalist structuring.

You appear, to me, to have nothing to say here -- so you will say
anything to be over-determining. Why don't you calm down the negative
evangelizing?


..|  Don't be deceived: The faithful fuck
..|  ...divorce...commit crimes of the body,
..|  acts against and through the body... etc.


I think this, at least Alan, is a good revelation which we can all
benefit from. People of all faiths and non-faith alike are engaged in
all kinds of licentious activity ("Mary Mary quite contrary") yet you
seem to find staunch offense with all people who do not insatiably
advertise this disposition -- that to withhold a pornographic state is
somehow non-Sondheimian, rigid, and operational. Indeed, to 'hedge
around' is the transcendent ideal for most Americans.

How does your garden grow?

Derek,

As someone who hasn’t been hesitant to make an ass of
himself on this list in the past, let me be the first
to say that the fact that you are not joking is
startling.

I couldn’t parody your post if I tried – what have you
done?

“. . . your composition is nothing but hate and
contestation . . .  Alan Sondheim media . . .
Sondheim-fabricated wedges. . . You clearly believe
all God-fearing people should die. . . You dance
around all kinds of stuff while invariably shitting on
anything which doesn't meet your preferences. . .  to
withhold a pornographic state is somehow
non-Sondheimian, rigid, and operational.”

This is hysterical, and I do not mean funny. It might
be funny (at your expense) if Alan’s work and the
piece you cite in particular didn’t mean as much as
they do to me.



Are you okay?


Really. You're joking right?

I'm sorry, Derek, but Alan is right on. I was born and raised in the big city
with all its wonderful cultural opportunities, but being by nature a nature
girl, I eventually opted for the rural scene. Fortunately, my last set of
foster parents, were bleeding heart liberals who lived in the country; and their
humanitarian views inoculated me against my impending years of religious
searching that almost became my ruin. Also, the philosopher poet I snagged for a
husband made sure I didn't jump off that cliff. He held onto my thong the whole
time. I survived the sacred or rather profane intellectual suicide of the
religious right. Since then my life has appeared to be the common road most taken
but it hasn't been. My morality and fear disappeared into an individual
phenomenology that no one can assail.

There is no universal solution for the situation as Alan has so capably and
starkly outlined.  You can hope You can pray But the truth of lies Won't go
away.

Read my poem 'rebellion' again. That's the poet's path. Live it, and leave
your own legacy. It might make a difference for someone, but I guarantee it
won't for everyone, at least not for a necessary mandate.

Mary, Mary

ten years ago, before the company made a sudden reversal. All of them

PRESS ADVISORY: CLAC Condems Mass Arrest of Demonstrators
on the Eve of the Liberal Party Convention

PRESS POINT: Saturday November 20th, 10am
Corner of Viger & Bleury, Parc Riopelle

Contact: Stefan Christoff, the Anti-Capitalist Convergence of Montreal
Cell: 514 885 8246 / Email: clac@taktic.org

Montreal --- Friday November 19th, 2004 --- On the eve of the Quebec
Liberal Party Convention, upwards of 100 people were encircled, arrested
and ticketed while demonstrating to confront the neo-liberal economic
agenda of the Charest government.

Organized by the Anti-Capitalist Convergence of Montreal (CLAC) to
denounce the Charest government ongoing attacks on all sectors of QuebecÕs
society, the demonstration was met with unprovoked police and state
repression.

At approximately 7:30 pm, the Montreal police force, in full riot gear,
surrounded the demonstration. Several protesters were singled-out, thrown
to the ground and arrested by multiple riot police. Others were detained,
handcuffed and forced to sit on the cold concrete ground over the course
of several hours, while waiting to be processed for an unjustified arrest.

This silencing of political dissent in Quebec is not new. During the past
five years, more than 1850 demonstrators, involved with various movements
for social justice in Montreal, have been victims of mass arrest policies
enforced by the Montreal police. The vast majority of those arrested,
charged and dragged through the legal system, have won important legal
battles against state repression winning their trials, the vast majority
of charges being dropped or dismissed.

The CLAC demonstration took place as part of a broader fight-back against
Charest, already initiated by labour unions and the community sector to
disrupt the implementation of the Liberal Party agenda and work towards a
general strike in Quebec.

some dudes for 10 bucks. He warn't sayin who...
.......[rimshot]
    The lips was shut as to who was responsible for woht. So many.... No
one would say, but it was sure, thét one daye thét they wouldn't be able
to stop from boastin en braggin bout the shit, as it move from the
chatter of couch conferences to, on the corners of, Me downtown.  The

ear stud en a dank pipe. All the stuff was rough but they'd be goin back
to Pallo so they could pimp it all up. They spent the whole daye en come
the Sun de red for down doin thét buildin. There was still some of the
frame left en More held onto the tubed metal himself.
    Come the next daye, Pallo did a boot for the bwoys en helpt No en
them take the Was down to the potholes wiph some 40ozers en an oz of
Sensi Star thét Pallo dropt on them. They all went swimmin en by the
time it the Sun for down they was drunk en blunted wiph the Was.

mornin but he done tell them thét, nuh? No, he cyan quite figure for all
this. He Gaon but No, he jus lil himself, gree. Peace. It jus all happen

but they   remember any of it. They only say so en thét jus done make
them feel like worth much en all the shit jus keep fallin apart en maybe

a powerful rection like that is to be welcomed  (in away its the way his
work appear as - in a kind of flow..one is never sure what dirrection it is
going) - shows someone is at least reading Alan...I sometimes think - kind
of -  " blast and curse Alan!" (or worse!).. then another part thinks...
"There's too much of!!!"  then..."but its incredible! " (deep down I'm maybe
a bit jelaous of Alan's energy, the mass of it, the shear quantity,...then I
think - sort of  - "this is all crap, there's simply too much of it,
bilgewater".. ...then I think (or part f me feels) "mavellous !!! great !!!
...incredible!! long live NY and THINKING Americans!!"

I can understand varying reactions to alan/alan's work and each reaction is
valid to some degree (eg what about Barthes discussion of writerly and
readerly texts etc?)..the "hate " etc is inside the poem and  in Alan's work
it is  dificult to separate the work and Alan's "true " thoughts etc  ..his
personas frm his poetry or philosophy...and so on...

one is by turns fascinated, repelled, annoyed, made angry, bored, enchanted
beyond a stone, very interested, irritated, wondering........

The Anti-Empire Report, No. 15
By WILLIAM BLUM


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Subject:      Re: I'M GIVNG AWAY RECORDINGS OF MY JAZZ POETRY

With marginal posting ability here abroad I haven't had much chance to pipe up on the
threads of
interest & this one hits close to home since I've been doing a lot of text & sound
improvisations for the
last 25 years with sax, electronics, invented instruments of my own design & tape
installations.  I'm a
little woeful that all the examples that have been mentioned so far seem to fall in the
poetry & jazz
category when there is so much that has been done in all genres of new music.

I don't have a lot of my text/sound pieces online but here is a link to EUY, a zaumist
opera for voices,
invented instruments & electronics created by Semantic Never Vanish (myself & Elizabeth
Was, circa
1986).  This is a 45 minute piece so the mp3 downloads are a bit hefty but those of you on
broadband
interested in works outside the poetry & jazz category may find something of use.

(Click on the links for EUY)
http://cla.umn.edu/joglars/radio_caterpillar/index.html

That said, I really encourage you all to take up Vernon on his offer.  I got one of his
CDs months ago &
the interplay between readerly voice & instrumental voicing is intuitive & quite sensitive
plus there are
not many poet/bass players in circulation.

nobody's talking  about jazz poetry the discussion wa a guy who said  he
didn't trust  saxophone with poetry  at readingss  i read with musicians
constantly as i stated  i've been called a jazz poet  at times  or been
told or spoken of as having written jazz poetry
but  i'm not a jazz poete and  i write what i write

hey by the way if you want to hear some jazz poetry  come to the bowery
poetry club
tues  the 23rd of nov  for david amram's  74th birthday party  7pm i'll
be reading one of my jazz poems there
and improv is not necessarily jazz  and adeena is not a jazz poet

tired haven't read any of other posts yet  but vernon is great me too my
cd with mostly jazz musician  ( the first one0 is great  and i almost
entirely for its 73 minutes avoided reading jazz poetry  also creeley did
a cd recently w/jaz musicians  and it certainly ain't jazz poetry

I think that this (by Derek) is a valid response in many ways - or at least
if we could leave off the "nothing but"  - I can see however what angers
Derek - its
partly I think the pretence by Alan to a "great knowledge" and much of what
is said in HAMMER - while, yes, it is insightful - is not correct. Much of
it is waffly and fairly meaningless.Worse it sounds very defeatist....

To take one aspect - there is no inevitabilty about the defeat of the left -
which is  -if not what Alan says - somewhat what he points toward.

The following is an example:

6. The left continuously focused on the negative aspects of the Republican
party, over-determining, at least in print, the violence of a world-view
at odds with the rest of the planet. The left - by which I mean liberals and
anyone in an oppositional relationship to the Republican party - remained
unable to disseminate anything that would register in relation to basic
moral issues; instead it reacted to the implicit violence of the right which
insists on transcendent legislation within monotheistic
demands.

This is pretty much waffle - ingenious waffle, but waffle all the same, and
confuses the issues - what does it mean?? probably /Alan doesnt even know:
no examples are given..sure there truths hidden in there but also mistruths
and a lot of sheer nonsense - if he is including (as he says he does) the
broad left he is thus diminishing the work done by many people in
disseminating knowledge about the present regime and the war etc that people
are still not politically aware to take strong reaction to radically to
change the system is sad (or that they didnt vote Democrat is certainly a
bit of a worrry) - but there is not really much difference between the Rs
and the Ds - capitalism will/ would have continued ) BUT that nothing was
done or could have been done as is implied insidiously here is nonsense.
The democrats could have completely opposed the war and also the Homelands
Security act - they (with one or two exeptions) did nothing - from cowardice
or probably complicity - or both). There could have been massive strikes
across the US, massive actions - they will indeed happen - large scale
actions as in the 70s...I can predict that just as Alan predicted the Bush
win... There are half truths in what Alan is saying but it ultimately
(becuse of the fuzzy - blurred - thinking leaves people wondering  - what
can we do ? How do we stop this war which is extremely barbaric (the poets
arent even opposing it very much? That writer Sondheim is saying nothing can
be done! And he's one of the best! He knows so much!! Maybe we should all
give up???...)) - the US invading Iraq can be compared to Germany invading
Poland to France etc  Alan implies by his Hammer that nothing is or was done
by radical groups or 'radicals' such as Moore and John Pilger (ok they are
not "militants" but both brave men who are spreading very much correct
messages  - nothing waffly from them - some "propaganda" of course...but
that's part of the deal) and also many groups who bravely fought the
terrorism of the regime now in power (they would also have had to fight a
Kerry regime).... I took part in marches even spoke out in a pub where it
was a wonder I wasnt punched out and put up posters against the war: my
friend  and his group worked at the street level in NZ struggling to
activate the working classs and connect to the US workers - there was a
strike by the Longshoremen which Bush supressed violently; but we were kept
informed of that and other radical working class efforts against Imperialism
etc There was huge anti war in NY and many other places in the US (as well
as around the world) ...there are still fights - in Chile the poeple are
struggling and showing their opposition to these criminals who are meeting
there for APEC (another farce)...No way was/is nothing being done -  if you
want to focus on the bible bashers they are always there..my sister is one,
went to Banglasdesh and tried to convert Muslims !! But there are - you can
bet - many working class people working at the street level to fight
imperialism - hammer is thus a betrayal of the struggle and a betrayal of
the working class who are used in Imperialist wars as cannon fodder...their
blood is spilt so we "intellectuals" can produce epics etc/....

But I still like Alan's work! And I like epics! And HAMMER is interesting -
I'm dubious that Foucault's book is THE book (of course his ideas are very
cogent and much of it (by Foucault) is relevant  - the power/truth problem
etc). HAMMER is challenging - it doesnt make me angry - but it certainly - I
can certainly see how Derek is feeling about this.

Alan's absorption in his work - yes as a huge poem it is probably a great
work - has dangers of condradiction and confusion (ok, if not essential, in
poetry) in analysing political and human realities that are current - and
maybe also in facing the reality of eg the fact that it is calculated that
100,000 civilians have died in Iraq - counting those dead in Fallujah the
toll is possibly 200,000. Bourgeois elections in the US would not have
stopped this carnage..and looking at HAMMER as a political document it is
seriously flawed...

But I repeat I still like Alan's work. And as far as I know him, I like
Alan!  He is (or what I have known of him since about 2000 has lead me to
feel he is) in fact intensely sensitive and feeling about these issues of
politics and power and so on - I know that, and I know he is not a
"warmnonger" or a "betrayer" - of course he isnt.....I'm using some rhetoric
above....but:

But I can see where  Derek is coming from.
Derek has honestly stated his feeling about Hammer and that is good.

PS   (I haven't looked at the instance below relating to pornography
yet..Hammer needs some hammering out! (Curtesy Rich ll, Bill Shak "Yet, I

no I'm not. I'm saying knowledge FAILS TO REGISTER because for the

IRRELEVANT.

it wouldn't have mattered. the war was NOT the issue. most people are
willing to give up privacy.

yes, I protested as well but it didn't matter. we had 1/2 million out
against the RNC and Bush's popularity went up. these tactics aren't
working.

oh please, look at your rhetoric! "betrayal"! why not say I'm a 'smasher'
- which is the Stalinist extension. and here in NY I don't see working
class blood being spilt any more than anyone else's. unless you leave this
mindset - which i think is exactly the problem, no one will get anywhere.
I've heard this rhetoric since the 60s and we've fucking lost! get with
it. there has to be a better way.

well, these numbers - the 100k - are from Lancet; check out analysis on
the http://www.iraqbodycount.net/ site which lists names and incidents and
comes out with a current total of 16604, much smaller.

and you call the elections "bourgeois"? you'd be hooted out of our
neighborhood which is lower middle and working class. again, this outmoded
rhetoric. and how do you KNOW they wouldn't have stopped the carnage?

in accord with alan's post and larry sawyer's and others' concern re
election fraud this time 'round, i think it's certainly worth reading
the researchers' summary statement, which i append below...

The Effect of Electronic Voting Machines on Change in Support for
Bush in the 2004 Florida Elections

Summary:
- Irregularities associated with electronic voting machines may have
awarded 130,000 excess votes or more to President George W. Bush in
Florida.
- Compared to counties with paper ballots, counties with electronic
voting machines were significantly more likely to show increases in
support for President Bush between 2000 and 2004. This effect cannot
be explained by differences between counties in income, number of
voters, change in voter turnout, or size of Hispanic/Latino
population.
- In Broward County alone, President Bush appears to have received
approximately 72,000 excess votes.
- We can be 99.9% sure that these effects are not attributable to chance.

Details:
Because many factors impact voting results, statistical tools are
necessary to see the effect of touch-screen voting. Multiple-
regression analysis is a statistical technique widely used in the
social and physical sciences to distinguish the individual effects of
many variables.

This multiple-regression analysis takes account of the following
variables by county: - number of voters - median income - Hispanic
population - change in voter turnout between 2000 and 2004 - support
for President Bush in 2000 election - support for Dole in 1996
election.

When one controls for these factors, the association between
electronic voting and increased support for President Bush is
impossible to overlook. The data show with 99.0% certainty that a
county's use of electronic voting is associated with a
disproportionate increase in votes for President Bush.

The data used in this study come from CNN.com, the 2000 US Census,
the Florida Department of State, and the Verified Voting Foundation -
all publicly available sources. This study was carried out by a group
of doctoral students in the UC Berkeley sociology department in
collaboration with Professor Michael Hout, a member of the National
Academy of Sciences and the UC Berkeley Survey Research Center.

With marginal posting ability here abroad I haven't had much chance to pipe
up on the
threads of
interest & this one hits close to home since I've been doing a lot of text &
sound
improvisations for the
last 25 years with sax, electronics, invented instruments of my own design &
tape
installations.  I'm a
little woeful that all the examples that have been mentioned so far seem to
fall in the
poetry & jazz
category when there is so much that has been done in all genres of new
music.

I don't have a lot of my text/sound pieces online but here is a link to EUY,
a zaumist
opera for voices,
invented instruments & electronics created by Semantic Never Vanish (myself
& Elizabeth
Was, circa
1986).  This is a 45 minute piece so the mp3 downloads are a bit hefty but
those of you on
broadband
interested in works outside the poetry & jazz category may find something of
use.

That said, I really encourage you all to take up Vernon on his offer.  I got
one of his
CDs months ago &
the interplay between readerly voice & instrumental voicing is intuitive &
quite sensitive
plus there are
not many poet/bass players in circulation.

LESLIE THORNTON and ALAN SONDHEIM screening of new work

NOVEMBER 27th (Saturday) at 8 p.m.

at MILLENNIUM
66 East Fourth Street, New York

Please come!

LET ME COUNT THE WAYS: MINUS 10, 9, 8, 7 (20 min., 2004) by LESLIE
THORNTON. "LET ME COUNT THE WAYS is an ongoing serial about violent terror
and its aftermath. In episodes Minus 10, 9,8, and 7, personal reminiscence
is mixed with archival and new footage in an exploration of the interior
of fear. From footage of the artist, a father on the way to Hiroshima,
through reference to 9/11, the phenomenology of horror and the echo of its
rupture are presented with an intensity which moves the viewer from
history to the present and beyond." (Leslie Thornton)

WORLD PREMIER (length and presentation mode variable, 2004+), by ALAN
SONDHEIM. "I usually work with laptop performance; this time we'll try DVD
+ voiceover. It's more monolithic, maybe more intense." "Sondheim produced
many of these works through creative mis-use and adaptation of the motion
capture technologies at the VEL (Virtual Environments Laboratory). Using
the technology against the grain, Sondheim disrupted and redistributed
built-in assumptions about the imaging and integrity of the human body and
the capture of the 'real.' The results are beautiful and moving, both
alien and very human, enigmatic and intimate." (Sandy Baldwin, West
Virginia University)

Why are they irrelevant - what left , what people on the left , what groups?
Are they suddenly irrelvant becasue the US is now Republican (the working
people are hardly better under either D's or Rs - that's the GAME being
played !!) (here ist Labour or National - although there are  number of new
parties lately, doesnt alter the basic charade that goes on here as
well...) - its never been anything radical or "advanced" it (the US - but
also Britain, Germany, NZ, Australia etc etc) has  always been a capitalist
country run by capitalists and the working people, with MORE struggle COULD
make a difference - negativity doesnt help them - (not neccessarilry strikes
that is only one tactic..not always (but some times it is) a very good
one) - the big challenge is to the working class (anyone who does not own
the means of prodution) is direct struggle to overcome capitalism or there
will be more wars, more incursions into personal freedom etc

no ther isnt - you are blindee by superficialities  -in love with toys like
computers and computer languages

When Kenendy became president (Chief Butcher of the US) the Vietnam war
accelerated or at the very least stayed as it was .
There is NO funadamental difference both are driving the same economic
engine for the ruling class who have power and money and want wars (or they
have wars when they want them).

Because a lot WAS done (an election result is nothing - it is a trifle in
comparision to the major fovces involved here) and changing a system of
oppressive system takes time.

Wiling to give up...?? Eh?? Maybe willing to cooperate with the new terror
in the US and terrofied and complacent and or bemused by the Homelands
Security  act ( Micheal Moore found just about no one had read it so he did
read it ) - read 1984 by George Orwell...learn something about politics...
go and see Fharenheit 9/11..........
Willing to live in a state that promotes terror? I think the war and the
Homelands security are very much linked  The War OF Terror is THE issue. You
Americans thnnk that killing hundreds of thousands of people (and
sacrificing young men - always poor working class men and women) is ok as
long you can have freedom to write poetry or paint pretty pictures: that
seems to be Silliman's line  and Perloff's etc  In other words "we're ok
mate" and bomb the rest  - they  arent Americans, they wear turbans. That's
how it looks from NZ.

what are unions  - they are organisations of working people and at the very
least they give some proitection to lower poad wrokers - sure these  things
dont happen so esily or in the way we might hope: but people who do real
work on low pay are always under the threat of losing their jobs and other
things - jail when they find they cant pay their way. You are trivialising
the people.  If unions are weak it is because of years or  deliberate
infiltration and erosion of the unions by the ruling classes  - but there
are other more direct methods of struggle

in small ways we all contribute to eventual change - dont belittle your
protests etc

without protesting 'you' (one) are (is) going to give up  - Bush's
popularity increased for a number of reasons - Hilter's was high once but it
would be hard to get Germans to support another Hitler now.  The protests
need to escalate to total revoluition - war on the streets - political power
comes out of the barrel of a gun.

 in Chile the poeple are

Literally - I dont know the details but she and her church (dont even know
what church) were in Bangladesh trying to "spread the word to muslims" etc
but I dont care about my sister, I dont get on as you can imagine -
different "mindset" to borrow a phrase (more later) - that was crazy ( I
thnk she was nearly killed) - I dont hate her just dont get on - but it's an
example of religious fundamentalism. Bible bashing and Koran bashing if you
will!  The point is the protest recently seen against Bush etc in Chile  -
this situation doesnt simply stop because there was an election in a
decaying Imeprialist capitalist nation !! A nation that is actually losing
the wasr in Iraq (one of the weakest countries (militarily for its size) in
the world!!)

ther is nothing worng with my mindset - YOURS is the problem mate! get REAL!

in politics rhetroic is always used - Hammer is full of it  - a lot of it is
NEGATIVE and hence divisive to the struggle...
I'm not a Stalinist - you havent lost  - you are thinking in short terms -
there is no magic change that is going to occur in a few decades and no
radical difference between now and the 60s 70s....except maybe the lessons
of the Vietnam war...you are so obsessed with tecnhnology you overlook
people - they , unlike computers, eat and breathe and cry etc and they bleed
in Iraq ....a computer is only a powerful calculator

So if you fiddle the figures enough - you will probably find that no one has
died in Iraq - so you amreercians can just worry about Enron, taxes and
whether whoopsies can marry each other etc trivia most of it...

Fallujah to take one example - an Associated Press guy was trying to cross
the river frm Fallujah and saw a family of 5 gunned down - all killed -  by
a US helicopter (NZ Herald last week AP) and as was said on here by someone
who was in fallujah the US soldiers target civilians (10 year old shot
through the head) and ambulances - lets get real here - we  are not in
cyberspace  (at least we are but the people in Iraq arent)

why is it outmoded it is technically correct - the bougeosie are those who
now own the means of production - the big factories and the banks and the
utilities and ultimnately everything in the Capitalist worlds(s)

> - Alan, definitely NOT marxist.

its your lack of basic understanding of how capitalism works leased you into
fuzzy thinking, if you sti8udied marxismm wthan open mind you might learn
somethng -   - as Pound was led astray - brilliant as he was

I also live in a working class neighbourhood - I know that most of them dont
understand politics or marxism: understand thiu though I have spent msot of
my life working in factories and later as a lineman I have associated with
the working class for years - in many cases some of the "tradesmen" type for
eg are very racist - right wing...I am well aware of the materials (the
human materials around me) ...most people (for long times) who are "working
class" struggle to survive and or take very little notice of politics a lot
round here dont even read or listen to the news) (AND I have been to NY and
was in the Lower east side  etc in 1993...ok I didnt see huge swaths of
theuS - hardly saw the US but I have an idea what its like in NY, if not
particulary profound or in depth)   ..but that's not the whole picture of
course...
ok we are both in so-called working class areas. My rhetoric in fact
disturbs you I can n see that...because it is in fact based on some powerful
truths.

Lets imagine that there have been some US sloldiers who died in Iraq (you
seem to think no one died over there ) - are they capitalists - gave up
there $60,000 a year job  or their position as an owner of Microsoft to get
go to Iraq - unless all of them are from parents on US$40,000 upwards - none
below that ..... as a cyber fanatic you have a vested interest in continuing
capitalism and microsft etc sacrifice some blacks or some 20 year olds who
know verylittle whose parnets are poor... from Detroit or Chicago  or
wherever so that we can write poetry is the story....

Despite the above here is a lot of good stuff in Hammer!! And I support your
other work fully....dont  take this too seriously or personally (the "you "
here is probably a gerneral "you") - this might sound angry but I am just
firing salvoes...dont worry about it too much.... I'm not even neccesarily
marxist myself .....just like to see the realities sometimes (and I am aware
how problematic is the nature of reality - will tell everyone how i broke my
leg this year  if the occasion arises!!): a part of me would love to just
disappear out of all this and hide away in acco land or in my little house
or whatvever, chill out, in fact, although on a low income I live the life
of Riley as it is, (no bombs here) things are not hard for me personally,
one  advantage of being in NZ, one can live very well on a low income (I to
haevbeen down the "I am all right Jack" path  [for YOU maybe read
ONE.]......I am multitudes - I am mass of contradictions..dont worry about
it Alan. (I do mean what I say (albeit I use a lot of rhteoric)) - but
realise that "getting angry " is silly and does or can lead to rhteroic
which is always distorting -politics is often whose rhetoric is the
loudest - unfortunately.....but I think some of the things I said are right)

Now old Nick will get stuck into me......lol

The trouble is there does seem to be a terrible/beautiful reality out
there - your  "its terrible to be alive"  - is still powerful (as a poem
maybe more than a philospophy).  Its terrible also though to be dying from
the effects of a bullet or schrapnel or bombs or napalm.  We are arguing
these things - right or wrongly - with correct attitudes or facts or not  -
because we care.

I don't see how setting out the dimensions of a struggle is a "betrayal" of
it.

And Richard, the age of the bourgeoisie is over.  That's why the
Enlightenment, which was always a bourgeois project, is crumbling.
Something else is happening now.  I thought Alan's analysis an interesting
beginning.

An aside: I completely failed to see how Alan was advocating a pornographic
state.  Wasn't Abu Ghraib the defining image of the pornographic state?  He
defined Rapture as the elimination of the Other, which is what it has in
common with pornography, also an elimination of the Other.    Sexual
prurience and pornography are always bedfellows; pornography is the
apotheosis of contemporary capitalism.  As Paz said, even Sade would have
been shocked by the way libertarianism has been yoked to capital (and yet
capital is the wealth of Protestant virtue - how to parse that one? Stop it
or you'll go blind?)

Cheers

This guy sees an ad in the paper for a job in the Zoo.
So, he heads  down to the Zoo and meets the zookeeper
and enquires about the job.

The zookeeper tells him that there’s a shortage of
monkeys this year, and he needs someone to dress up in
a monkey suit and pretend to be a monkey in a cage.

The guy thinks it’s joke until the zookeeper tells him
that the pay is $500 a week and he’ll get 3 breaks a
day! The guy thinks this great,  "I’ll do it!"

First day on the job, he suits up and hops into the
cage. At about 9am the zookeeper comes by and tells
him to look lively, so he puts down his newspaper and
starts giving it loads. He’s making all the sounds,
"Oooh! Oooh! Aaah! Aaah!". His hands are flying
everywhere, he's eating bananas, he’s swinging around
on the trees.

After about 10 minutes of this, he thinks, "Jesus this
is great fun...I’m really catching on to all this
swinging and acrobatics!". So he gets brave and starts
swinging around and around a high branch in a tree.

He keeps getting faster and faster until he loses his
grip and flies up into the air and then lands in the
bear cage!

The bear comes over and starts mauling him, biting
him, clawing at his eyes and causing grievous bodily
harm.

He panics and starts shouting, "Somebody help me!! I’m
not really a monkey!! Aaghh…I’m a man, help me! Help
me!!!"

To which the bear replies, "Shut the fuck up or you’ll
get us both sacked!"

Dwarf: "I’ve never liked Marxist jokes."

Puppet: "Yes you have, they’ve just been on you! Ha."

Dwarf: "No, I’m more of a formalist. Dig:

So, f(x) = 4x - 7y + z walks into a bar and strolls up
to the bar, and asks for a pint of Guinness.

Barman says, ‘Sorry, but we don't cater for functions
in here.’"

Puppet: "You call that functionalism?"

Dwarf: "Nope. See above."

Puppet: "Right, formalism. Same difference. I think
you fucked that one up; should have said
functionalism."

Dwarf: "Here’s another:

If Jack helped you off a horse would you help Jack off
a horse?"

Puppet: "I doubt it."

Dwarf: "So much for socialism. Ha!"

Dwarf: "So, I’m an alcoholic."

Puppet: "I thought that was your Confessional cap you
were putting on just now."

Dwarf: 'Thought? It says C-O-N-F-E-S-S-I-O-N-A-L in
bold letters across the front. It comes with
membership. Adjustable strap, one colour only."

Puppet: "What?"

Dwarf: "I said, it comes with membership. Adjustable
strap, one color only."

Puppet: "Oh, I thought you said ‘colour.’"

Dwarf: "I might have."

Interlude: 'won't soul music change / now that our
souls have turned strange'

Dwarf: 'I said I’m sad!"

Puppet: "That is false. You said you were an
alcoholic."

Dwarf: "My basic problem is weakness. Lack of will."

Puppet: "Meh."

Dwarf: "My cat has better – much better – hygiene than
me."

Puppet: "Well, you bring home the bacon - she's the
pussy."

Dwarf: "Barely."

Puppet: "Yes barely providing for yourself and a cat,
that is a shabby showing."

Dwarf: "I’m not interested in spectacle. If anything
it is a society I’m opposed to."

Puppet: "One can no longer be a bohemian in good
faith. One must provide for himself in a non-gendered
manner."

Dwarf: "There is just enough in you – just enough of a
glint – to keep me interested."

MIME-Version: 1.0

less and less seems to matter and it's good i'm not
Cold Mountain and can't turn towards moss. but i'm
aware more than ever of the slow movement of the
planet, our inconceivable position on the thinnest of
crusts, the localized nature of our wants and
desires, the fragility of every good thing upon the
face of the earth. we're tottering, we look out, we
sense the plasma, enormous forces forsaking us just
for the moment, for the first and last breath. we
come together online but i'm sick of the absence of
touch, nothing for any of us but words and no
shudders. it's good, for of one not to be here and to
be here, but there are so many places in their
loveliness i would like to see before i die, places
already fast disappearing beneath the towering sun.
this is not metaphor, not the world as if it were the
world, but a gentle disassociating as i feel myself
slipping into some long sleep, some disconnecting
denouement. only then will leaves grow quietly and
unseen, scurryings meandering beneath the grass and
sightless for so many of us. there is no irony here,
not for a moment, no cynicism, only the desire for
the beauty of the world and nostalgia for so many
opportunities that will remain permanently missed.
how many people have we made promises to, that we
will never see again? promises made beyond wars and
peaces, beyond births and slaughters, cures for new
diseases, sudden earthquakes, floods, extinctions. i
am thinking of quiescence, the fineness of sunsets
one might never see, conversations ending decades ago
- i can hear them now - that will never be revived.
and i would leave all belonging among them, and i
would leave all desire among them, all holdings and
possessions, all plans, short and long term, imminent
and transcendent, all of the length of a pine board.
our strategies fade before our eyes, as do the sounds
of voices stilled forever, the slightest movement of
a hand, that particular gesture that defined you,
that slight of hand, that slightest gesture,
forgotten after the passing of personal knowledge, so
that books may get it wrong, reconstruct nothing,
theorize and pretending, holding off their own
harbingers of death, as death they announce, as death
they proclaim, the oldest of charms. one only can
hope for the forgetting of this and these, for the
releasing, so that others may be seen momentarily in
their scurryings as movement beneath and within the
stars, as designs enfolding, unfolding, but never of
commitment impossible to conceive, retain. these
books and wires, this natural world, retains and
moves beyond, always beyond in each and every
direction, of the quarters and fifths of directions,
of the firsts and seconds of directions, this
movement uncharted, forgotten, the tiniest smile at a
joke only half remembered, times that were always
those which were, of the scent of a spring evening
and certain trees and flowers, of changeling worlds
and the sound of winging birds

LET ME COUNT THE WAYS: MINUS 10, 9, 8, 7 (20 min., 2004) by LESLIE
THORNTON. "LET ME COUNT THE WAYS is an ongoing serial about violent terror
and its aftermath. In episodes Minus 10, 9,8, and 7, personal reminiscence
is mixed with archival and new footage in an exploration of the interior
of fear. From footage of the artist, a father on the way to Hiroshima,
through reference to 9/11, the phenomenology of horror and the echo of its
rupture are presented with an intensity which moves the viewer from
history to the present and beyond." (Leslie Thornton)

WORLD PREMIER (length and presentation mode variable, 2004+), by ALAN
SONDHEIM. "I usually work with laptop performance; this time we'll try DVD
+ voiceover. It's more monolithic, maybe more intense." "Sondheim produced
many of these works through creative mis-use and adaptation of the motion
capture technologies at the VEL (Virtual Environments Laboratory). Using
the technology against the grain, Sondheim disrupted and redistributed
built-in assumptions about the imaging and integrity of the human body and
the capture of the 'real.' The results are beautiful and moving, both
alien and very human, enigmatic and intimate." (Sandy Baldwin, West
Virginia University)

I was lucky enough to see Wanda in Venice, California reading from her =
new book. I even got her to sign it! She wrote that I was a phenomenon! =
So is she!

I think I am in love. But she has a boyfriend and I am married. Such is =
life.

Here are two pictures I took of her:

Human beings, as can anything sentient, can be described as relative=20
organized systems. It does not matter whether we know what those organized e=

are for the purpose of this discussion. As relative organized systems we=20
regularly experience numerous diverse dynamics involving those essences with=

spatial parameters. It does not matter whether we define those spaces for th=
e=20
purpose of this discussion. The dynamic of speaking is different than hearin=
g though=20
it contains the dynamic of hearing. The dynamic of writing is foremost=20
because it contains the dynamic of reading and can contain the dynamic of sp=
eaking=20
and hearing. When writing well, the writer creates such velum thin slices of=
=20
space and essence that the near transparency of the forming characters and w=
ords=20
creates no obstacle letter to letter, word to word, page to page. The idea=20
that words must leap off the page is not good counsel for writers. Good writ=

there is a meaningful dynamic beyond the intended and simple meaning of the=20
words. I believe that
any writer actively writing in this flow cannot possibly be disengaged from=20
authenticity, because he is authentic to the dynamic.

In a letter to Ed White, May 12, 1949, Jack Kerouac made what is perhaps the=

most important single statement of his literary theory. He wrote that he=20
believed the truth could not be stated in any formula, but that it existed o=
nly in=20
the movement from moment to moment, incomprehensible, ungraspable, but=20
terribly clear. By the way Mary Jo, you should resist any effort to define J=

religious perceptions - there was a time when Jack firmly believed his own m=
other=20
was God. He resolved his Buddhism in - Mexico City Blues. He may have fallen=

out of favor with the 60s kids because of his initial support of the Viet Na=
m=20
war, but he was the single greatest influence on one of the loudest voices o=
f=20
the 60s Bob Dylan. Jack's political and religious ideas were like his litera=
ry=20
theory - moment to moment. His idea of truth was always framed by time. He=20
believed that time was the only universal dimension.

As for Emerson.......Our spontaneous action is always the best. You cannot,=20

MJM: Can you be a little more divulging about your source here. The fuller
context would be interesting to know.
Do you know Michael Magee's Emancipating Pragmatism, emerson, jazz and
experimental writing (recently out from U of Alabama Press). I am just
getting into it and it's quite good.  But the quote here makes me wonder
whether or not the path of Cruz has intersected with that of McGee(yet).
The path of pragmatism from Dewey to Zukofsky is much easier (Dewey a
teacher at Columbia during Z's years there).

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

As a grad student, I used to walk my dog around the
block for one last 'go' before heading off to campus.
I lived around the corner from Masani De Veaux, who
did the same thing with her dog.  Almost always coming
from opposite directions, we regularly intersected
before class.

This morning on my way to class, we intersected once
again.  Sort of.  I was listening to WBAI, which was
broadcasting a tribute to Audre Lorde.  I was
surprised to hear that Norton put out a biography on
Lorde called, "Poet Warrior," written by Masani De
Veaux--surprised because, even now (& I may be jumping
the gun here), I can't find any p.r. online about it.


De Veaux read from the book, and it sounds great.
Lorde has been one of my heroes since my undergrad
days, so I'm looking forward to checking this
biography out.  If anyone should hear or read anything
about it, please drop a note.  Thanks ~

IN THE HIBISCUS ROOM

Writer's Group Reading Series, Hosted By Karen Lewis
Featuring North Side Writers
Friday, December 3, 7:30 p.m., $4, $3 Students/Seniors, $2 Members

The Northside Writers Group was founded in 1990 by Lois Vidaver. They've met
continuously, twice a month, since then, including scheduling a social
dinner on any month with five Thursdays. Over the years the meeting
locations have changed from churches to bookstores to coffee shops. The
group is currently being led by Lionel Nosenchuck and they meet at the
Ascension Lutheran Church, 4640 Main St. in Snyder. The Northside Writers
have had more than a half-dozen books published. Their members are
responsible for over 20 columns published in The Buffalo News and other
periodicals. Members write and critique short stories, novels, non-fiction,
poetry, humorous columns, memoirs, and biography. They believe their
long-term success is due to the valuable criticism they give and receive.
Once a year they publish an issue of Over Coffee, a chapbook sampling of
their work. This reading will feature the writers that appear in 2004
edition of Over Coffee. Signed copies will be available for purchase. For
further information, visit their website: northside.artshost.com.

Lionel Nosenchuck has a B.A. in English Literature from the Ohio State
University. He has studied creative writing with Pulitzer Prize winning

Subject:      JFK - quick remembrance
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Certain things I try not to remember - whatever they are, nevertheless, some
still hang with the weight of a yoke - like a dark halo that has lowered
itself down around one's neck.  I have a suspicion that JFK's assassination
this day of 1963 in Dalles, Texas remains so as an event that snapped the
trust of a whole generation that had begun to see JFK as a light out of the
cold war torpor, darkness and dread that had most of us boys in crew-cuts
trying to be well behaved through out the fifties. (Yes, I know JFK's Bay of
Pigs and Vietnam history - and it's imperialist no goodness).
Yet something in the heart snapped that day and a bigger internal dread got
opened. I suspect it was the conscious or unconscious paranoid
acknowledgement that there were big forces within this country that would
not abide change that they could not control. Forces that became
transparently evident in the subsequent assassination of Malcolm X, Martin
Luther King and Robert Kennedy. The cumulative and chilling impact of which
again sparked and deepened the paranoia about who and what really runs this
country.
Fortunately - instead of quelling dissent - major eruptions lit up the
landscape - when one remembers the success of the anti-war movement and the
various progress and accomplishments of Third World, feminism, disability
and environmental protests and movements. (among others I have probably
missed.) The landscape was radically altered.

But today it looks more and more like we have come back to "dread" as the
operative 'swing state.' George Bush's association with Texas - including
the angry scowling, fake cowboy look - Cheney, James Baker, Ashcroft, etc.
now give a face and public power to all those fundamentalist, reactionary
forces that sought to and  decimate the Kennedys, Malcolm and King - let
alone all the other casualties of various movements.

It's hard to say how what now seems like an inevitable civil war (or
totalitarian oppression) is going to play out in this country. But the
clouds of such seem very gloomy, Unless I  - and to many people with whom  I
talk - are deeply skewed on this, there seems a waiting for the next shoe to
drop, that expectancy in the air. Whether the next explosion here comes from
within or from abroad, who can say.  I don't know about anybody else, but
watching George Bush arrogantly reveling in what he and his folks deem as "a
mandate' makes me think much more scary things are about to hit. I don't
think it's going to be easy here for quite awhile.

I can already hear somebody saying, "Don't dread, organize." As indeed I
suspect many of us will variously do. I suspect we are in a catch the breath
moment before new demonstrations and actions begin to jell. If not, they
done won real bad!

All this from just thinking of sitting my 22 year old self in a barber's
chair on Haight Street (before there was a long hair on site) - and the
barber saying "You want it cut like Kennedy with the bangs combed back"  and
the voice interrupting the news to say, "The President Has been Shot."  And
back out on the quiet Street, one older black woman slowly crossing an
intersection tears running down her face and me running to find a pay phone
to talk to someone to find out all the phone lines were ominously down.

On an incline, with the blood husking
down to the feet, all of it every drop below
and the feet sinking into hearth-worn ground,
I declare to none listening that
my autopsy has been already rendered.
So that it may seem sweet and funny, they yanked
the wet guts out like a string of sausages
and the audience laughed, and the canned laughter
laughed and there was no performance funnier.
My seers saw it for themselves --
I was split down the middle and the one
was rubbed against the two. There wasn't
a moment of greater uproar than when
they made up the song, my juices a slushy maraca:
"You pull torque, I pull toward, you pull back
and I don't cut slack. This is how we twist
the human organ." And their ground rhythms
rhymed on, slinging with the best of them
past the brightest Saturday night on the strip.
Seeing this from below it seemed glacial, as in
frozen stone, as in melting stone, glacial
as in the creeping emergence of the "not new."
Heat especially is not new, and not new like
the slow flow of a stone set still is not new,
like the skin as weather proofed sac of the blood.

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Catriona STRANG & Nancy SHAW at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, December 1,
2004.  Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of
the
performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Catriona STRANG and Nancy SHAW are from Vancouver BC and co-authored Busted
(Coach House).  They each have books from ECW in Toronto: Low Fancy and
Scopocratic, respectively.  Strang's collaboration with Francois Houle is
available on the CD Clamourous Alphabet.  Shaw is also a visual artist and
curator.

Busted is a book about governance, and a catalogue of possible relations. It
explores a litany of genres concerned with allegiance and refusal, and
inhabits
the array of ways we do or don’t jive with self, group and governing
relations.
It is a polemic, it is a collage that interrogates how language and
linguistic
discourses contribute to shaping the relationship between the subject and
polity.

On Busted: Christine Stewart in an afterword gets it right.  "Possibility is
in
acoustic resistance ... think of our ears as eyes ... Not not polemic.  But
liberation."  This sounds dialectical, but sound is not.

It's an argument where three's company - two's a crowd.  If we're 80%
innocent,
is there a newborn guilt?  A grave digger's delight?  I guess that's what's
left
to ponder?

But liberty, how?  When there is no outside.  Only the inside rehearsing an
entrance - into a building with spots - ear-eyed madonnas stretched to sing.

Heroic as if there were something to win.  "Our little party strived to
inaugurate a climate of - of what?"  No longer interested in the money poem,
a
poet waits for her debacle - the war poem that Busted implies within.  A
language with no outside.  What is left after words?  Heros land desire or
ground it.  A fractured erotics with a different end.  "... peppered egress
a
momentous bit."

The future Subtext 2005 schedule is:

January 5, 2005     David Maitlin (LA) & Lou Rowan
February 2, 2005    Alicia Cohen (Portland) & Seattle School

Well, I've found it here:

And here:=20

The rationale behind this is disturbing. First there was THAT Lakoff
interview during which a caller from Louisiana was perplexed that "activist
judges" were attempting to separate church and state! I couldn't work out
how someone could dream up such utter bullshit. After all, wasn't the
separation just one of those things you learned about along with the Boston
Tea Party etc at 9 y/o?  If the Selby site really does belong to him,
perhaps something like the below helps to explain where this caller got the
idea - perhaps also would explain what else drew these 'moral' voters out o=
n
Nov 2.
=20
=B3Over the years, we have seen a disturbing and growing trend in our federal
courts to deny the rights of our states and our citizens to acknowledge God
openly and freely. These tortured legal decisions distort our constitution,
our nation's history and its tradition in an effort to secularize our syste=
m
of government and divest morality from our rule of law.=B2 (from the Selby
site)

the violence continues
the streets are stripped
there's nothing inside the corpses
plasticine and transparent organs
some sort of broken things
liquids fossilized for gram analysis
the covers are manufactured by victory
inside beautiful and smooth
at one point some sort of sound
there's nothing red there
it's all projection and mirage
mouths swallow nothing 'as'

The Last Laugh


``When you're hunting you don't expect somebody to try to shoot you and
murder you,'' Wagner said. ``You have no idea who is coming up to you.''

``We're all old, dyed-in-wool hunters,'' he said. ``We wouldn't go home
because of this, but we will keep it in our minds. We're not forgetting
it.''

- Response in Wisconsin after five hunters were killed. I'm sure the

It isn't I was saying that extreme negativity could be seen as a betrayal -
in some lights - and also in some parts of Alan's analysis there are serious
flaws (and some negativty - although  a lot of it is a strong critiqe and
hence it is or can appear "negative" with a positive purpose I presume)
which I feel trace back to his rejection of using Marxist analysis -
although I realise that a Marxist approach isn't the whole deal. And Alan
(mostly eschews Marxism or at least doesn't se it as the main tool - I see
it as very important - but there are other philosophic "additives - he
mentioned Foucault (not the mathematician!) who I do have some interest in -
what I have read of him  is interesting and  I do want to read  more of
him - but Alan agreed with me he is problematic...) ) As I said Hammer is
still interesting.  I life is more - or in addition to Alan's other works
(well I think) it is "separate" from the main stream of what Alan is  doing
( and Alan is an extraordinary creative and I think talented writer/
thinker - no doubt of that  - he's a least a n extaroridinarly original and
innovative writer (ok I feel abit obssessed with The Great Big Caculator but
there you are..we are all unique)) - and thus I can see it as "political
statement " - of course I know it is also virtually a kind of poem  - sort
of semi-deconstructionist docu...and much of it ISN'T waffly - I'm not - I
was not saying that Alan is/was "betraying" anyone - trying to get to grips
initially with another - who was it wrote the strong critique originally?

> And Richard, the age of the bourgeoisie is over.

In this you are completely wrong (you are also completely partly right  -
see on...!) - the bourgeoisie is a technical term (if we are using Marxist
terminology here) for the Middle Class who supplanted the aristocracy and
monarchies from (approx) 15th to the 20th Century (there is no exact date
for the development for Capitalism but we have now reached the highest stage
of Capitalism - i.e. Imperialism) and eventually became the ruling class -
so the Bourgeoisie - by definitions are in fact now - NOT the Middle Class
(there is really no middle class in the technical sense) but the Ruling
Class.

Of course you can chose to ignore any Marxist approaches as completely
outdated but there are many modernist/postmodernist philosophers interested
and influenced by Marxism - this isn't to say I believe in a Utopia...no..or
even that I am a Marxist per se - just that I feel we need to make more use
of it.  I am  - if I can be deifined - who can? an individualist
petit-capitalist non-working idling - Marxist/father /grandfather/ would be
thinker/armchair revolutionary/ and general waffler and poet (to
some!)......

Of course I use the word 'bourgeoisie's deliberately - - maybe a little
provocatively -clearly it has other connotations and individual
interpretations and is associated with 19th Century novels etc where it
meant say in novel by Austin or George Eliot (I love her (Eliot's) work) or
others of that time the new rich or whoever: and in fact of those who are
the Bourgeoisie there are many who in technical terms are "working class"
but are allied to the Ruling Class. This debate about class etc was on a few
years ago so on this list  so I don't want to go back to it...so many
complications..but class and class struggle is a major factor and also the
struggle for production etc is major factor in the making or historical
change.
but there are other struggles - the struggle for ideas - that between the
sexes etc etc the inter and intra class struggles, religion and culture
(mixed and mired with politics).......

 Enlightenment, which was always a bourgeois project, is crumbling.

the above statement is dubious - the Enlightenment was an interesting period
and important some of its "achievements are still with us  - but yes I also
question "progress" do we - sub specie aeternitatis - ever make any
progress?  Kant etc - never read him started but didn't get thru his
"Prolegomena"  - lol
...but  one person;person's Enlightenment is another's nightmare


> Something else is happening now.  I thought Alan's analysis an interesting

interesting

> beginning.

it is - I was wasn't disputing it was interesting: adn something else is
happening but the economic grind continues...  - the part I took out was
flawed all interesting works are so I think (maybe all thinking is flawed
that has any value to us) but there are other parts that are - I feel - more
cogent - here is one part I want to revisit:

13. Cultural capital in the US is far more important than economic capital,

The question is tho -  what is "cultural capital" ?  But in "modern" class
analysis - certainly cultural factors are enormously significant - even Mao
Tse Tung points that out in his philosophical analyses. And culture and
class are inextricably mixed and there are other things of course  there may
indeed be
such a thing as a "pure" art..... but the cultural is important - but MORE
important? The basic driving forces are economic. The US  (the CIA) was able
to buy many Moslems eg in Afghanistan (the British won many a "heroic "
battle in India by buying of opposing generals  etc) - lets face it religion
doesn't stop hunger!! Or lust for cash!! Very few "religious"
fundamentalists (unless they are completely bonkers) eschew cash ...And my
sister's (my sister who tried to convert Muslims in Bangladesh - or her
church did I think) husband who was in banking - when he was retired was
obsessed with investing money - wondered what I'd done with $40,000 ( I
spent it on a trip to the US, leant some to a mortgage, the rest on women
and booze etc pissed it against the wall as they say over here...) BUT you
take away the money or income from these so-called middle Americans or
middle kiwis - bible bashers - gay bashers - what you will, and they
fold: cash is the thing - never forget that .  At base. Easy to forget that
when you have enough - Cashless America is hell as is Cashless Anywhere)
..but this section of Hammer I like greatly (don't get me wrong Hammer
fascinates me -
both as a kind of poetic method and a way of thinking -it is flawed but not
nonsense...it IS meaningful)) (it can be argued that everything is
meaningful)

Here is a section I think was/is quite cogent, mostly true as a critique :

21. The left has been hampered by split ideologies and critique; the right,
which permits no critique, has worked constantly with umbrella ideologies.
On the right: division beneath the sign of the absolute. On the left:
absolute division.

Except for the epithet "absolute" in the last sentence - of course "division
of the sign of the absolute" is right - very good....insightful....  I want
later to look at other parts of Hammer: but this I like:

5. Bush appeared, alive and life-like, at the World Trade Center ruins,
almost immediately after, conjoining his image with the intensity of
destruction. One can relate this to the dynamics of post-traumatic-stress
syndrome; the two images are indissolubly linked.

Yes - profound. And poetic in a way. Bush The Joker in the ruins - "never
forget this" .... as in a "traum" and the people traumatic - Bush
indissouble - Bush linked - hate me or love me - look at this - follow
me....I am arisn - I have appeared...I am...

Hammer I feel is a bit like a Sondheimian "Howl" - or could build into
one...

>
> An aside: I completely failed to see how Alan was advocating a
pornographic
> state.

I didn't see that either  (the pornographic aspect) - I haven't looked
closely at everything in Hammer  yet- a lot of it as I said is very good and
as you say useful as a kind of definition - but surely one against which to
react... and it is written in a kind of deconstructionist mode (as I said
above) - and deconstructionist can be good - in some places and some times I
like 'deconstructionist'. (Or what I think I understand of that term...)

Wasn't Abu Ghraib the defining image of the pornographic state?

Abu Ghraib  followed on from Mai Lai (no?) in fact the journalist who
uncovered that massacre also uncovered Abu Ghraib (Seymour Hersh)

 He

This is unfortunately the kind of apparent meaninglessness that plagues
Hammer. Other what?  Rapture could be defined in a million ways - it is
partly also a
neurological/biochemical process as well... but is it meaningless? - I say
somehwere that perhaps nothing is meaningless - I know this (Rapture the
elimination of the Other) possibly derives via Freud & Lacan and others (
however I dont know a lot about those people  - picked up scraps
only...)...yes on more thought this is less "waffly" than I first
thought..hmmm

This isn't very clear (some truth lurking in it tho - Paz may have been
right to a degree - great poet) - but Abu Ghraib - like the Nazi death camps
etc comes
when nations invading another realises things are getting out of control -
the people who like war and violence also like control and humiliation -
power, in fact.  The army teaches people how to kill and humiliate not how
to be nice to others etc and conquerors for thousands of years have got into
this stuff - but Imperialism (Capitalism to the highest level) is in its
final stages. The Moslems have a point about the corruption and degeneracy
of Western Capitalism - it is arguable - in the light of the Right's desire
to now invade Iran - that the US, Britain and Israel needs to be stopped by
any means. Form Korea and Vietnam to today the invasions the brutality - the
interference has gone on too long - the Japs learnt that - two (terrible)
bombs made them into a polite nation.

It may be that the militant left has to throw in its lot with the "right
wing" religious fundamentalist Moslems ..they are at least doing something
about the Imperialist incursions etc and in my book they are  (relatively)
"revolutionary (and compared to US Imperialism - "advanced" ( Al Qaeda  etc
we may need) to stop the US etal - by any means.

If Iran IS invaded - God - if he exists - help - the US Israel  - Britain -
etc
>
But I don't want it to come to that - I feel good people from all camps
throughout the world are being used here - let's not flashover into
uncontrolled hate. Maybe I am/or was wrong in my statement  - no diff D's or
R's - talking generalities and broad differences. as...

Ever since Bush "won" there have been some frightening/ disturbing
developments - (ps - I liked  Stephen Vincent's recent post about J F K etc)

It's amazing to me that so many are discussing the idea that
people are trying to secularize our government. And now there
are those who are trying to add god back to government.

Nowhere in the constitution does it state that there should be
a separation of church and state, but I was taught (what was
it fourth grade?) that Europeans came to this land to escape
religious persecution. The premise of America is to not legislate
religion, to not validate an "official" god i.e., choosing one over
another, etc? I thought that's been the plan all along. I get
the feeling that it's reached the point (because of disparities in
education) that large segments of our population are completely
unaware of our nation's history even on a rudimentary level.

Or course, we can't base our whole opinion of America's religious
by the callers to talk radio shows. Routinely I've found these
people to be the most obsessed and much of it is probably staged
for that matter.

I'm just glad to read discussions of what's going on with our gov't
because I do believe that we need to keep abreast of what the
neo-cons are up to, because the christian coalition is pulling their
strings. I was raised attending baptist church and it wasn't by
choice, but I didn't protest. It's always been strange to me to hear
accounts of baptist churches when the church I attended was really
low-key. No fire and brimstone, etc.

The thing about the Repubs in congress now--they wouldn't be
doing any of this without the prodding of christian groups funding
them and providing their votes, etc

Thanks for the terrifying article article -- though I can't help but
wonder at the

 >> The next night, the Coalition of the Willing performed before a sold-out
 >> crowd of young people who'd gotten a crash course on the threat to their
 >> civil liberties. An American flag was the band's only backdrop,
signaling
 >> the anarchy in their souls.

Is flying the patriotic colours of the dominant machine in this day and
age really a symbol of "anarchy"? Maybe the flag had such resonances
back in the late 1700s, but in the context of the scenario described in
the article seems more like a survival strategy. Reminds me of the ways
Russian writers -- and even Elizabethan writers -- used to bury their
subversion in state-approved garb. The barbs would inevitably stick out,
but with the veil of censorship draped over them.

-- hey, who's that knocking at my door?

Men ask the way to Cold Mountain
Cold Mountain: there's no through trail
In summer, ice doesn't melt
The rising sun blurs in swirling fog
How did I make it?
My heart's not the same as yours
If your heart was like mine
You'd get it and be right here

This is wonderful. Cold Mountain's one of the few consolations in times
like these. I'd recommend Red Pines' translations which include the
Chinese - he has a number of other translations as well that are quite
moving - alan

I met a brilliant scholar once
learned and shrewd without peer
his examination fame echoed through the realm
his regulated verse surpassed that of others
his judgments excelled all those of the past
how could he follow in someone else's dust
now rich and honored he chases wealth and beauty
what can you say about broken tiles or melted ice.

("The Collected Songs of Cold Mountain." Red Pine, translator. p.65)

Notice how Red Pine leaves out the punctuation, as in the Chinese, opening
the stride of the lines like horses galloping across a field.
On the other hand, Snyder was just a grad student at Berkeley when he
translated some of the Cold Mountain archive, a budding poet who knew where
he was going, and went. However, until the book at hand came along, I
preferred, or trusted, Burton Watson's translations.
 Red Pine's translations seem to have been made twenty years ago, as there's
an Introduction by John Blofeld. (Could he still be alive?) But he already
had a working knowledge of Chinese and lived in the culture. As with Copper
Canyon Books in general, this book is worth owning just for the pleasure of
its design.

 Another excellent book of Red Pine, written under his real name, Bill
Porter, is "Road to Heaven: Encounter with Chinese Hermits," which Mercury
House published in 1993. It in, Porter leaves Taiwan, where he was then
living, to seek out hermits he believed were still living in the rugged
mountains of mainland China. Friends thought he was crazy to believe this,
but he made the journey and the result is this amazing book.

When we talk about human culture, we're lucky to have this fellow, Red Pine,
working in the field.

HAPPY THANKSGIVING=8BNO WED. 24th READING

Monday, November 29, 8 pm
Talk Series: Katy Lederer, =B3The Heaven-Sent Leaf=B2
A talk about the relationship between artists and money from both historica=
l
and contemporary perspectives. How have current artistic attitudes about
money developed over time? Are they rational or irrational, critical or
reactionary? In what ways can artists thoughtfully engage with a
contemporary milieu=8Bin which the pursuit of money is axiomatic of so much
else, from the pursuit of happiness to the pursuit of war=8Bwithout merely
mirroring or balking at its assumptions? Katy Lederer is a poet and
memoirist now living in New York. An avid critic and reviewer, she was the
editor of The Poetry Project Newsletter from 1999-2000.

FREEDOM HO, OR HARRIET TUBMAN'S TALE, another chapter in the "Black Moments
in Great History" series
and
ROMA, a poetic documentary by Jacob Burckhardt

AT  THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB
308 Bowery, between Bleecker and Houston
SUNDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2004 at 7PM

See Our Trailer at http://www.louisthefourteenthstreet.com

The films:

LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH STREET
Directed and produced by JACOB BURCKHARDT and ROYSTON SCOTT
(2004, 38 minutes, digital video, color)
If Cecil B. DeMille met Jack Smith, John Waters, and Ed Wood Jr., the fruit
of their collaboration might be LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH STREET.
Cuckolded king Louis the Fourteenth Street vows vengeance on his murderous
second wife Mary Antoinette.  A beautiful princess imprisoned in a dungeon,
a lusty wet nurse, a charming Greenish Blonde Prince, a bleeding royal
ghost, and a voracious guillotine round out the cast of this experimental,
color saturated, digital scary fairy tale of a featurette.
More information, and a trailer, at:
http://www.louisthefourteenthstreet.com

FREEDOM HO, OR HARRIET TUBMAN'S TALE (2001)
A vision of rural Americana that Norman Rockwell would never have dared to
paint. An inside look at the soft underbelly of the slave trade and one
woman who fought for freedom because she knew how. A chance meeting with a
questionable Snake Oil salesman provides Harriet with a means for her end i=
n
this historically heartwarming story which promises to bring a smile to the
face and a tear to the eye. A little Pam Grier, a little Scarlett O=B9Hara,
and a whole lot of funny, this movie is guaranteed to tickle the Freedom
Fighter in everyone. Another extremely bad taste collaboration between
Actor/writer Royston Scott and cineaste Jacob Burckhardt whose careers may
now be over, starring  fancy downtown performer extraordinaire Mahogany
Plywood, and introducing that sexy ing=E9nue Miss Kimberley Lewis.

ROMA
By Jacob Burckhardt (2004, 10 minutes, 16mm, Black and White)
A poetic view of the Modern Ancient city from the point of view of a
familiar pedestrian.  The stones, water, graffiti, lights, the Pope, cats,
people in the streets, clouds, markets, and even a few monuments, captured
on a Bolex with grainy black and white film.

impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I saw this - your post made me look again - it repays a lot of re-reading
(there are a lot of other good poets on here  - so much to look at) but, and
Alan is able to do this - he is like Picasso who could paint in virtually
any style before he was 16. There is something of Wordsworth or Ashbery (at
their best)  here; or maybe echoes of Whitman: what is interesting about
this is also (if one is) aware of the other "modulations" simultaneously
going on in Alan's "project" with its many strands - its many voices of
frequencies: multi vocal - multi sonic and many media based - maybe all
media  - as we know  - something will then come with a whole lot of
numbers - then a mass of computer jargon, then a kind of language poem and
then something like this - added to that are his visual works - the case for
Alan being a greatly significant poet in the world is getting better - but
who knows - and Alan seems to actually know what he is doing!! Incredible -
and the energy -

A few years back I used to eliminate almost everything except Alan's work in
the forlorn hope I might look through them all but my comp. crashed  (not
because of the Sondheim effect tho!!) - but course its all on the archives.

And there were a lot of other interesting writers - but I  just had too much
to look at.  But that I suppose was good in a way.

Modern Cyber-Netizen=92s Song

Netizen:
I am the very model of a modern cyber-netizen
All logic I dispense with, and all taste and manners jettison;
I come in every stripe, from the conservative to radical,
And know it all except for how to spell, or write grammatical.
I haven=92t got a clue about the use of logicality
And drivel on with made-up-factoid bargain-bin banality.
I=92m found on TV, radio, and many other "medias"
But cyberspace is where I=92m most particularly tedious.

Geek Chorus:
He=92s found on TV, radio, and many other "medias"
But cyberspace is where he=92s most particularly tedious.
Yes, cyberspace is where he=92s most particularly tedious.

Netizen:
I flame opponents hairless from a dozen different pseudonyms
Each one a ruder, lewder pun on Anglo-Saxon crudonyms --
And where I find civility and hot debate have been at ease
I break it up with spamming, flaming, scrolling, and obscenities.

Geek Chorus:
And where he finds civility and hot debate have been at ease
He breaks it up with spamming, flaming, scrolling, and obscenities.

Netizen:
I=92m known for disputatiousness and other sorts of knavery
>From purposeful mendacity to things yet more unsavory.
I=92m ignorant in every field, poetic to statistical
Which only makes my points of view more thoroughly sophistical;
My posts are pure unparagraphed expressions of my vanity
Impossible to parse except perhaps for the profanity.
My attitude=92s aggressive and my tone is sanctimonious,

Geek Chorus:
His attitude=92s aggressive and his tone is sanctimonious,
His facts are bad, conclusions wrong, and arguments erroneous!

Netizen:
In short when I can tell you why I=92m such a dull vulgarian
And why my selfish egocentric views are libertarian
And why my sense of humor roots about in prepubescency
As if I don=92t quite understand the cause of my tumescency
Or why my only mode with love is jokery and jestering
While fear of being hurt leaves all my real emotions festering,
You=92ll know why I=92m at home alone abusing my puerility,
Compulsively exhibiting my manual facility.

Geek Chorus:
You=92ll know why he=92s alone at home abusing his puerility,
Compulsively exhibiting his manual facility!

Netizen:
Wherever civil reason is accounted most iniquitous
You=92ll find me absolutely inescapably ubiquitous.
In short, all logic I reject, all taste and manners jettison,
Because I am the model of a modern cyber-netizen!

Geek Chorus:
In short, all logic we reject, all taste and manners jettison,
Because we too are models of the modern cyber-netizen!

I usually don't pay much attention to these things, but recently I went to
the NEA site to check who won the big money for the last poetry giveaways.  I
ran off the list and then hunted down most of the winners and examples of their
poetry.  Holy shit!  What a load of crap! --

Poem after poem is written in the same dry, boring, derivative, academic
voice and tone.  A lot of this stuff comes off just a foot above Hallmark verse.
It's been a long time since I read such stuffy, pretentious writing all in one
place.  At one time such poetry might have been au courant, but that was a
long, long time ago.  Nobody -- and I mean NOBODY -- with an I.Q./E.Q. above
freezing, who is even tenuously connected to the real world, thinks or talks this
way.  I challenge anyone who isn't a high school student to dig out some of
these poems and read them without laughing.

The real shock for me was that Ron Silliman was among the winners.  How a
panel that was dominated by Robert Pinsky and others of similar bent managed to in
clude Ron in this otherwise very conservative, very unimaginative crowd of
winners is absolutely beyond me.  I wonder how Ron feels about all this.

Aren't these supposed to be blind submissions?  I can't believe these
panalists don't know know who's submitting what.  Most of the winners are well
published with the most conservative, seriously out of date and out of touch
journals and book presses.  I'm talking about the kind of simpering poetry that has
been around for four decades at least!  Except for Ron, there doesn't seem to
be a street-wise poet in the bunch.

What the fuck is going on with this agency?  No wonder so few people besides
poets read poetry.  We need is to gather a few thousand writers who are at
least trying to do something different and march on the NEA!!!  Where's that
gillotine?

Best, Bill

The neo-cons are pushing a law through Congress that would "acknowledge God
as the sovereign source of law, liberty [and] government" [
http://context.themoscowtimes.com/index.php?aid=131199 ] in the United States. What's more, it
would forbid all legal challenges to government officials who use the power of
the state to enforce their own view of "God's sovereign authority." Any judge
who dared even hear such a challenge could be removed from office. You don't
believe it? It's called Constitution Restoration Act of 2004.


And here it is:

Constitution Restoration Act of 2004

any matter to the extent that relief is sought against an element of Federal,
State, or local government, or against an officer of Federal, State, or local

(1) an offense for which the judge may be removed upon impeachment and
conviction; and

(2) a breach of the standard of good behavior required by article III,
section 1 of the Constitution.

Tell that to the petits stressing under their 50 hour working weeks,
glancing sidelong at the homeless as they hurry home, panicking about their
medical bills, terrified that all that credit will come crashing down on
them and that they too will end up on the streets.  &c.

The Enlightenment - from Rousseau to Wollstonecraft even to Joyce - was
always a bourgeois phenomenon.  Enzensberger is quite interesting on this.

Do some reading on the US Christian Right, Richard.  The Rapture is a very

Very good point. When I worked for the State of CT, at least one legislator
each session proposed something so idiotic that no remotely reasonable
person would vote in favor of. And passing a bill involves so much
favor-trading etc that most proposals that raise alarms die early and
deserving deaths. In the face of Bush et al, the complexity of the system
may be our best hope.

with the $20K this time 'round...

very happy for ron, of course... but if you read this past sunday's

in general, at how poetry is made to play to said imagined

The mechanism by which most fellowships are awarded is tilted in favor of the
insider. With the Guggenheim, to be eligible one must obtain four letters of
support. The letters that carry the greatest weight are those written by past
winners. Over the past several years Guggenheim Fellowships in poetry have been
awarded almost exclusively to academics. Not surprising. Academics are better
situated to ask for and receive such support, tightening a closed loop. The NEA
fellowship has similarly been awarded to academics year in, year out. I think
the rarefied air is getting to the mighty. Certain that anything outside their
paradigm is illegitimate, they don't hesitate in what they do--namely, stick it
to outsiders. Silliman is an exception, I suppose. I was one, too, this past
May, when I won the Mass Cultural Council poetry award. I was the only winner
who did not hold an advanced degree and/or teach. I was thrilled to find out
that I'd never met any of the readers or panelists. I know winning in the future
is a long shot, because human nature is such to favor those perceived to be like
oneself. Besides, I am likely to have pissed off a good many potential panelists
by this point.

Vernon,=20
Sorry to misunderstand your comment, but would you mind explaining what =
it is that Robert Corbett said that constitutes, in your opinion,  a =
"Very good point?" =20

First, Robert says, "...I don't think that is on the neo-con agenda..."=20

 In my view, Robert misses the point of the HR 3799 entirely.   The =
Conservative agenda is about power, and how to both increase the amount =
they have and how to retain it over the next 40 or 50 years.  And there =
are a host of ploys which the Right has used effectively over the past =
15 years to reverse their power-lagging status and take control of both =
the house and the senate.  In addition, as some of us know, they own the =
white house and are poised to restructure the Supreme court.  The bill =
isn't about what's on their agenda, it's about helping them fulfill =
their agenda. =20

Two specific ploys the Right has used to great success are: their appeal =
to the masses to descry the absence of God in our government, and the =
criticism of the nation's Education system (let's not digress on the ed =
point).   =20

Putting HR3799 up for consideration plays to the Right's "our =
government's lack of god" ploy quite nicely.  And if the bill is =
defeated, the right wins because they get to shout: "See, we told you!"  =
And the good Christian folks in Ohio will slink back to their voter =
booths and say, "Yeah; you all are right.  We need God back in our =
government."  Then they'll pull the level for another Right-wing =
candidate.  Better yet, if the bill manages to come out of committee and =
pass...Holy Shit!  they win again!  And I don't think I need to explain =
why or how here.  =20

And  Robert's point, and indeed yours here regarding whether a bill can =
be passed too misses the point of strategic counter-arguing.  =
Iinitiating bills (whether or not they even make it out of committee to =
the floor to get voted on) is a ploy that plays to the issue of keeping =
the Right and the Left at odds while working on the effort of appealing =
to the moderates for support of their wholesome, virtue rich agenda. =20

And finally, in Robert's points, he implies that I lack knowledge of the =
governmental process.  While that comment is a charmingly weak ad =
hominum at best, it lacks credibility because it is a presumption based =
on the writer's uninformed opinion.  Which, if I'm correct, and the =
point is both unfounded and unsubstantiated...hardly qualifies for a =
.."Very good point" comment.   IMHO

So, if you wouldn't mind, could you take a moment and elaborate on =
exactly what it is Robert wrote that represents a "Very good point." =20

Thanks,=20

  Very good point. When I worked for the State of CT, at least one =
legislator
  each session proposed something so idiotic that no remotely reasonable

A deathblow to wisconsin beer drinkers....  This jingle & its
accompanying scrolling beer lights are a big part of my early memories,
they were very common in houses in Wisconsin Rapids in the 60s plus the
jingle played repeatedly & every day on the radio & for years...  mIEKAL

I am an academic.  Many of the innovative thinkers in most disciplines are
academics.  The entire poststructuralist movement is governed by academics.
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry is academic.  Medical advances are usually instigated by
academics.  And on and on.  But these panelists and winners!  I don't know
where these academics/poets are coming from.  It's as if they all live and work in
caves, unaware that digital television is now available.

Well, maybe I do know where they're coming from.  The list of winners for
2003 evinces a very neat spread across the nation.  Every area of the country is
represented equally.  How did that happen if submissions are blind?  Something
else is going on in addition to antique academic tastes gone nuts.  Some
shoo-be-do is at work here.  There must be a few innovative artists among middle
Americans?  Do they all conform to the same worn out rubbish?  Imagine a
Renaissance with an NEA.  Imagine the 19th century!  Today's best anthologies,
generally records of innovation, would contain the same poem repeated for 1000
pages.  Blake, Coleridge, Shelley, who are they?  Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Lautremont
-- forget them.  Stein, Cummings -- no way.

I don't know whether or not to be happy for Ron.  He's probably the only one
on the list of winners who actually deserves the award.  But in this crowd of
winners, he seems like the mistake, the one that got away, dare I say it --
the token.  I'd bet money that if some unknown had submitted Ron's manuscript,
word for word, he wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the winners circle, not
with this group of panelists.  Someone on the panel was able to match work and
author, and I suspect that happened with many of the other winners.

Whew!  I'd rather have my tax dollar pork barreled to wine tasters, rather
than have it swiped for this nonsense.

Best, Bill

To mark the anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education, Alphonse
Fletcher and the Fletcher Foundation will be giving $50 million to
institutions and individuals working to improve race relations. This
gift will be given over the course of the next several years to help
continue the progress toward racial equality started by the Brown
decision.

Some of the gift will be fellowships modeled partly after the Guggenheim
awards. Fellowships of $50,000 are to be awarded over a number of years
to scholars, writers and artists whose work has furthered the goals of
the Brown decision. Also, a portion of the money will be given to the
Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.

Grants will be available to scholars, artists and writers. Applications
must be postmarked by December 1, 2004 and decisions will be made by
March 2005. Applications at http://www.fletcher.com/philanthropy.jsp

We continue to receive inquiries from organizations seeking other forms
of support under the initiative. At the present time, the initiative
does not have funding programs available for organizations and we cannot
accept funding requests from organizations at this point in time.
Programs relating to organizational funding are expected to be launched
within the next six to nine months.

Heard Ron Padgett read from the work of Joe Brainard at University of San
Francisco this evening. Absolutely magical. I suggest for Noel a lovely gift
would be Ron's Coffee House remembrance of the life of. (Anybody got the
title handy - it's just out?)

And the night before at Booksmith on Haight Street, Hilton read wonderfully
from his new Soft Skull Press novel, A*Hole (with a genius cover design that
will be probably the coffee table conversation stopper of the season - right
there in the middle of a conversation about our, hmm, George). Anyone - as a
youth - who has either gone over the adolescent brink into big trouble
(taking their parents with them) or raising one or two or three of same,
will be very at home with the dizzying dark comic edges of this journey
through the hole of it all. A multi-fractal narrative look.

I wonder if Ron would be interested in disclosing which particular poems
of his won the NEA grants in 02 and 04.
Would be interesting to see (and "probably for all the wrong reasons"....)

This is nonsense - what small business people stress about (or don't) in a
50  or 2 or 200  hour week is irrelevant to what I was saying - a petit
bourgeois is a potential capitalist (bourgeois) - any one can be in debt or
worry about being homeless (or not )if they want to...it's a complete non
sequitur!!

 You are avoiding the point of definition of class  according to Marxist
concepts -as I said you don't have to accept the terminology  - but if you
do, then that definition I explained to you is true.

To others (in this you can learn) -  the writer also ignores everything else
I said and picks on one aspect in an attempt to humiliate me.  Very slick
with her knowledge on The Enlightenment and Rapture but vague on Class
concepts.   3/10 -  please do better next time - and READ the text carefully
before trying to answer the question.....Dont use words such as "petits" it
looks clever but we get a "sinking feeling" when we see terms like that in
answers by our pupils.... I know it's cool and "with it" and very "now" to
be clever these days but please be clear or you will be marked VERY hard by
teacher....

The River:  The Passage

mates. we must bore this continent like nothing ever. there is a river. there is a land
break. we can sandblast this way & trade skins for a guide & information. up & down
for years mates & we keep the king incommunicado. the natives they paddle out bright
peacocks & oh Lord Lord we are fat as tuna & how do we harvest these delectables. they
signal in their hands & bounce off toes      there is a deep running current & we can
navigate this delta & fjords & geographers busy illustrating swamps with a little
grass turf   space   then a little grass turf. where do we bury fires. how do we roast.
who can we eat. & an ancient terrifying mask stands in a canoe     speaks braille
& points. there is no treaty & we cautious to get stuck start ramming powder & bricks
the cannons pointed in disguise behind balsa & we invite a parley. discussion
in root language. using the eyes as believers. establishing hope. we shake hands & deathly
afraid follow deep running current watching us draw closer to the crocks & the ecstatic
piranha & what meat they see & we floating closer to the river level     spraying the
wild birds with shot hoping to pull out hoping to use reverse hoping to draw power
from the slaves pleading innocence pleading backward backward & we now
even with river line & mask looks back starts belly roll & we know this
is not India & mostly we are too far south & think of the trade missions     the blazing
crosses & like gnats the little fish move in & we delectable & we good down to the bones.

I was unclear, and I apologize for that. I was commenting on Robert's
statement, "can we all agree to consult with someone knowledgeable about how
bills work before we scream that the end is here."



I don't know what your experience with government is, but I do know how
government works, having, as I've said before on this List, created paper
trails for some dubious if not outright illegal government practices.



Proposed bills may serve strategic functions, but the bottom line is whether
they get passed, and how effectively they're implemented.



In my experience, any public policy statement delivered by a government
official is more than likely untrue, if not an outright lie. Contrary to
Bush's pre-911 assertions, the Republicans had a plan in place to invade the
Middle East if Bush won in 2000. Would people have voted for Bush if the
Republicans had said this up front?



I have my doubts about 9/11, given that no shots were fired in the Gulf of
Tonkin and Roosevelt knew the Japanese were going to bomb Pearl Harbor at
least a week before it happened. It could be the Republicans knew about it
and let it happen because it would further their interests and generate
popular support. I could speculate further, considering Daddy Bush was once
head of the CIA and hasn't lost his connections to people in power. And then
there is the Bush-Bin Laden connection.



Aside from Saddam being a cruel dictator, I can't help remembering Saddam's
attempt to assassinate Daddy Bush. The invasion of Iraq had nothing to do
with weapons of mass destruction or Saddam's cruelty, and a lot to do with a
family's revenge. I've seen this happen on the State level, from the
governor on down to his civil service appointees.



In my experience, personal feuds and greed are the real reasons for
government action or inaction. When I started out in my job in a highly
politicized social service agency, my bureau director explained that a delay
in $383 million of Office of Equal Opportunity/Community Services
Administration funds were blocked from reaching the agencies that needed the
funds to stay open because of a personal feud between the two officials who
controlled the money, not congress per se. In Connecticut, you talked to one
man on the Senate Apropriations Committee. If he liked you, your program or
legislation got funding. If not, forget it. One human mediocrity married
into this legislator's family and began a meteoric rise based on the clout
of his in-laws.



Many extreme bills are simply grandstanding for a constituency. It's not
important that they get passed or rejected;' the legislator has made himself
look good to his constituency for the next election. If something truly
bone-headed gets passed, at some point, something (perhaps equally
bone-headed) will get passed as damage control. Welfare reform has always
been a sexy issue: "put da bums back to work" (even if there are no jobs for
them). A year after welfare reform passed in CT, ahead of the Federal
reform, social services officials realized the people losing benefits were
going into the streets because the job training programs didn't train them
for positions that paid living wages. What to do? Create a Transitional
Housing Program from some account other than welfare. At the Federal level,
the money "saved" by welfare reform now goes into Section 8 and other
rent-subsidy programs. They probably spend more money on housing than they
did on welfare.



Even if something extremely good or bad gets passed, the political
favoritism in government hiring practices will negate the effects of many
proposals. A Clinton appointee at a government agency, for example, may
render any extreme legislation from the Bush administration ineffective.
Over the years I've wondered why so many programs designed to help people
proved to be ineffective. If the appointed director isn't an outright
incompetent, the agency's leadership will block the program's effectiveness
in other ways. The people who implement the government's directives can
sabotage bad policies in many ways. I have a certain amount of faith that
the corruptness and ineptitude of government will do damage control.



In my experience, American voters routinely choose against their best
interests. Yes, people may have liked Bush's "moral tone," but they also
like social security and health care and jobs. Many legislators realize that
their continuing to live fat and happy in the DC suburbs depends on
satisfying their constituency to some minimal degree. Some conservatives are
now leaving the Bush camp, so his support base might erode, even if the cash
flow from the Christian counterparts to jihad continues.



Moreover, I suspect that somewhere in Bush's second term, something is going
to hit the fan, perhaps Iraq, and the government will have a two-year
stalemate, as it did over Clinton's damp cigar.



I have my fears, just as everyone on this list does. But I have faith in the
incompetence of the system to contain the damage to a greater degree than
many people on the List expect. You can call Robert's point weak and ad
hominmen. Again, I don't know your experience with government. All I can do
is tell you my experience in a politically-charged bureaucracy and that one
of my closest friends is a leftist reporter

(www.newfocus.org <http://www.newfocus.org/> ) who speaks with Greg Pallast,
members of both political parties, ranks high in the CT Greens and has at
times buddied up with Ralph Nader.

Subject: Re: The GOP on the ROMP



Vernon,

Sorry to misunderstand your comment, but would you mind explaining what it
is that Robert Corbett said that constitutes, in your opinion,  a "Very good
point?"



First, Robert says, "...I don't think that is on the neo-con agenda..."



 In my view, Robert misses the point of the HR 3799 entirely.   The
Conservative agenda is about power, and how to both increase the amount they
have and how to retain it over the next 40 or 50 years.  And there are a
host of ploys which the Right has used effectively over the past 15 years to
reverse their power-lagging status and take control of both the house and
the senate.  In addition, as some of us know, they own the white house and
are poised to restructure the Supreme court.  The bill isn't about what's on
their agenda, it's about helping them fulfill their agenda.



Two specific ploys the Right has used to great success are: their appeal to
the masses to descry the absence of God in our government, and the criticism
of the nation's Education system (let's not digress on the ed point).



Putting HR3799 up for consideration plays to the Right's "our government's
lack of god" ploy quite nicely.  And if the bill is defeated, the right wins
because they get to shout: "See, we told you!"  And the good Christian folks
in Ohio will slink back to their voter booths and say, "Yeah; you all are
right.  We need God back in our government."  Then they'll pull the level
for another Right-wing candidate.  Better yet, if the bill manages to come
out of committee and pass...Holy Shit!  they win again!  And I don't think I
need to explain why or how here.



And  Robert's point, and indeed yours here regarding whether a bill can be
passed too misses the point of strategic counter-arguing.  Iinitiating bills
(whether or not they even make it out of committee to the floor to get voted
on) is a ploy that plays to the issue of keeping the Right and the Left at
odds while working on the effort of appealing to the moderates for support
of their wholesome, virtue rich agenda.



And finally, in Robert's points, he implies that I lack knowledge of the
governmental process.  While that comment is a charmingly weak ad hominum at
best, it lacks credibility because it is a presumption based on the writer's
uninformed opinion.  Which, if I'm correct, and the point is both unfounded
and unsubstantiated...hardly qualifies for a .."Very good point" comment.
IMHO



So, if you wouldn't mind, could you take a moment and elaborate on exactly
what it is Robert wrote that represents a "Very good point."



Thanks,

Alex

  Very good point. When I worked for the State of CT, at least one
legislator

  each session proposed something so idiotic that no remotely reasonable

  person would vote in favor of. And passing a bill involves so much

  favor-trading etc that most proposals that raise alarms die early and

  deserving deaths. In the face of Bush et al, the complexity of the system

  may be our best hope.

i was very happy to see the post below---always very happy to see when a no=

vanced degree and/or teach=E2=80=9D)!   not that all academics are undeserv=
ing, obviously, please don't anyone here take offense.   i RARELY see my fa=
vorites among big-time winners in anything.  i get in lots of squabbles for=
 complaining about this and about poet laureates etc. etc.  and personally,=
 although i=E2=80=99ve won my share of stuff over the years (including the =
MA award once, like michael hoerman....hey, and MA didn=E2=80=99t pick bush=
 either!  everybody move to MA!?), the nea ignores me and my favorites year=
 after year after YEAR, and i now try---although it is disappointing, don't=
 get me wrong---to use it as a reverse barometer of how well i=E2=80=99m wr=
iting, because it=E2=80=99s pretty clear they usually only pick =E2=80=9Cth=
eir type=E2=80=9D---which IMHO is not a good or interesting type to be.....=
.so why apply?  the money of course---and the off-chance that i'll slip thr=
ough the guard.  i wish i had BIG money and i would start an alternative ne=
a and make awards to (ahem) the "right" people!  imagine a robert-pinsky-ty=
pe-person applying and NOT GETTING ONE---what a character-building experien=
ce!!!!   ha!   also i would buy a llama farm.  maybe there is a way of star=
ting an alternative award system if we all contributed and invested the $$$=
---but of course if we were financially alert and able i guess we wouldn't =
be writing poems!  but i mean, really, how come if we're so smart we can't =
think of a way to support each other in this "award" way since the governme=
nt won't? =20
a happy alternative thanksgiving to all,

--------------------
The mechanism by which most fellowships are awarded is tilted in favor of t=
he insider. With the Guggenheim, to be eligible one must obtain four letter=
s of support. The letters that carry the greatest weight are those written =
by past winners. Over the past several years Guggenheim Fellowships in poet=
ry have been awarded almost exclusively to academics. Not surprising. Acade=
mics are better situated to ask for and receive such support, tightening a =
closed loop. The NEA fellowship has similarly been awarded to academics yea=
r in, year out. I think the rarefied air is getting to the mighty. Certain =
that anything outside their paradigm is illegitimate, they don't hesitate i=
n what they do--namely, stick it to outsiders. Silliman is an exception, I =
suppose. I was one, too, this past May, when I won the Mass Cultural Counci=
l poetry award. I was the only winner who did not hold an advanced degree a=
nd/or teach. I was thrilled to find out that I'd never met any of the reade=
rs or panelists. I know winning in the future is a long shot, because human=
 nature is such to favor those perceived to be like oneself. Besides, I am =
likely to have pissed off a good many potential panelists by this point.

Let's all remind ourselves that the 1950s and 1960s produced two major poetic
shifts that both found their way into the mainstream:  the Beats and the New
York School.  These were avant-garde events.  If one were to judge the
development of poetry in the USA exclusively via the 2003 NEA winners, one would
never know that these two developments occurred.  It's as if they've been buried
the way Reagan tried to bury all the cultural victories of the 60s.  Again,
except for Ron, the poetry represented in the winners circle is as bland as dry
white bread.

I am not annoyed.  I am not angry.  I am flabbergasted!  Why is it that the
other arts -- painting, film, dance, theater -- continue to change and develop,
in fact demand change and development, while the NEA's message is that poetry
has not advanced an inch since the confessionals.  The major confessionals
(Plath, Sexton, etc.), by the way, were far more interesting and daring than
what we get from these winners.

In my own department, only a few of my academic colleagues are conscious of
ongoing agitations in contemporary poetry.  I hardly blame them because, for
the most part, their areas of specialization do not include the contemporary.
Most of them are Renaissance scholars, or Victorian scholars, or Medievalists,
etc.  But the panelists should know better, right?  They are judging
contemporary work, so they should know something about it.  They should know something
about the sterility of Creative Workshop clone poems, right?  After all,
enough articles have been written on the subject.

I wouldn't mind so much if the winning poems, all conventionally structured
(but for Ron's), offered some juice, some edge, if they cut your fingers when
handled.  It's mind boggling that after all the battles that have been fought
and won, we're back to square one.  Are these panelists so clueless?

Believe me, I'm not at all comfortable putting the hard working winners in
the middle of all this, no matter how conventional they may be.  They have my
apologies.  But what else is to be done?

Best, Bill

Yes, but . . . there are mainstreams and there are mainstreams, and there
is more than one way of being academic. Yes, the Objectivists, Beats, Black
Mountain Poets, New York School poets, and more recently Language poets
have all been studied and taught by academics. They have had some
dissertations, conferences, etc. Some of them, but by no means the
majority, have even found their way into literary professorships. A lot
less of them have found their way into creative writing professorships.
They have generally not had that much impact on the Creative Writing
Programs, the AWP, etc., which seem to be the "mainstream" that has more
constant contact with winning NEA fellowships. Yes, there have been some
signs (look at the panels for programs in the last two AWP conferences)
that this situation is changing, but it's not changing a lot or quickly. I
don't actually know that I'd welcome such change, other than, sure, it
would be good for more of the poets I read and love to have more support
for their work, but I'm not sure there wouldn't be some problematics
involved in being more in tune with that part (creative writing programs)
of the academy.

Bill,

I wish I had some answers, but I don't. Like governments in general, I look
at the NEA as an institution that in no way supports my interests or
addresses my concern. I'd love to have an NEA notch in my gun, but knowing
who gets the awards, I remind myself that completing pointless paperwork is
a waste of time. The last time I looked, the head of NEA was a poet who'd
most likely favor the kind of poets you've described. If Reagan attempted to
bury the artistic and social gains of the 60s, Bush and his administration
seem to be burying the gains of the 50s. Maybe they'll air Dobie Gilis with
Maynard G. Krebs edited out of the scripts. Maybe June Cleaver will be
restored to her former prominence. I don't want to eat white bread, so I
make my own, as you know. Oddly, jazz fares better. It's abstract, so you
can't box it in the way you can works of language, whose preferentiality
could make for controversy. And it doesn't have naked bodies on its CD
covers. Just keep working beneath the underground. A lot of the time I
pretend I'm a secular monk writing for a more enlightened time than the
present. I'm not opposed to raising some hell, though.

 Best,

I'm not a full on expert on all the writers who
received grants in 2003 from NEA; and I sincerely
concede the point that with startling frequency it
seems like even modernism's innovations never occurred
let alone postmodernism, but

I do think we shouldn't make statements about the list
of writers especially the "except Ron" variety. It's
too counter to the idea of actually trying to "read",
to try to understand a writer without packing them
away into some camp they are supposed to fit in.

"except Ron" also packs Ron away into a camp, too.

For just a little example I encourage you to try to
find print or on-line works by

Diane Glancy
Joanna Goodman
D.A. Powell
Paisley Rekdal
Larissa Szporluk

interesting and compelling writers all, not *quite*
square in the mainstream or as white bread as is being
portrayed.

A*hole

*a novel by Hilton Obenzinger

(Soft Skull Press)


With A*HOLE, Hilton Obenzinger has created an experimental fiction readers=

will experience as much as read. He draws from sources as varied as Dante,=
=20
Mark Twain, the Patty Hearst story, the Biblical story of Abraham & Isaac,=
=20
Melville's Ishmael, detective fiction, his own experiences as a father and=
=20
a teacher on the Yurok Indian reservation, Hollywood, the porn industry and=
=20
more, which he swirls together around the vortex created by the pull of his=
=20
central hole.

A young boy wakes one morning to discover he is sinking into the earth=20
despite the new sneakers his parents promised would save him. A young woman=
=20
begins reviewing films before they are made. A postal worker named Gary=20
fulfills his occupational clich=E9 and attacks Danny DeVito. A father writes=
=20
letters to his wayward and far-flung sons. An archeologist finds evidence,=
=20
perhaps, of the permanence of time as well as earth. A detective accepts a=
=20
case requiring him to connect Patty Hearst to her other self. Though the=20
story in A*HOLE is in continual flux, Obenzinger skillfully braids the=20
multiple narrative threads into a novel which is much larger than its=20
physical size, lyrically beautiful, and absorbing through and through.

It's a disgrace that poets that are still eligible for NEA grants, unlike
Visual Artists, who can hold their brushes high. The problem is that
Congress doesn't think we are enough of a threat to eliminate these grants
to us. This is an embarrassment and needs to be changed.

CALL FOR PAPERS
Inspiration of Astronomical Phenomenon Conference

Proposal Deadline:              December 31, 2004
Conference Dates:               June 26 – July 1, 2005
Conference Location:            Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, Chicago

Proposals are invited for conference presentations at the Fifth
International Conference on the Inspiration of Astronomical Phenomenon
(INSAP).

INSAP conferences explore the rich and diverse ways in which people of the
past and present incorporate astronomical events into literary, visual,
and performance arts. This emphasis distinguishes INSAP from other
conferences that focus on archeoastronomy, ethnoastronomy, or cultural
astronomy. INSAP provides a mechanism for a broad sampling of artists,
writers, musicians, historians, philosophers, scientists, and others to
talk about the diversity of astronomical inspiration.

INSAP V will be based at the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum in
Chicago from June 26 – July 1, 2005.  Mornings and early afternoons are
devoted to conference presentations.  Afternoons and evenings will include
field trips and artistic performances. Venues include the University of
Chicago’s Oriental Institute, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Adler
Planetarium.

Invited speakers at INSAP V include Barbara Stafford, Professor of Art
History, University of Chicago; Jim Kaler, Professor Emeritus of
Astronomy, University of Illinois; John Carswell, former curator of
Islamic art at the Oriental Institute and Sotheby’s; Donna Cox, Professor
of Art and Design, University of Illinois; Mary Quinlan, Professor of Art
History, Northern Illinois University; and Michael Shank, Professor of the
History of Science, University of Wisconsin.

INSAP V is dedicated to the memory of one of its founders and strong
supporters, Ray White, Jr.

Conference Presentations:
A complete proposal for a conference presentation includes a Presentation
Proposal Cover Sheet; a 250-word Presentation Proposal Abstract; and a
one-page CV.  We especially invite presentations on the inspiration of art
produced for public spaces, including planetaria. Proposals relating to
North American arts and modern astronomy are also encouraged. Artists are
encouraged to submit proposals for presentations or exhibitions within a
planetarium theater or in one of the gallery spaces reserved for the
conference (these proposals may include up to five image attachments).
INSAP V offers several presentation formats: slides, Powerpoint, video,
DVD, and two planetarium theaters (with Zeiss and Digistar/StarRider
technologies). We will have a traditional poster presentation format as
well as an electronic bulletin board for displays. The latter formats may
be made accessible to general Adler Planetarium visitors. Notifications
will be sent on February 28, 2005.

Forms and further information are available on the INSAP website:
www.adlerplanetarium.org/INSAPV

Complete proposals (Cover Sheet, Abstract, CV) must be received by
December 31, 2004.  Emailed proposals are preferred.  Proposals and
questions should be sent to [ mailto:jlacy@adlernet.org
]INSAPV@adernet.org or:

As an old hand in the book biz, Hilton, can I suggest you let people know
where they can most conveniently order your book online, from Soft Skull or
wherever. The death of the bookstore - let alone the bookstore that may
order A*Hole - I assume makes other avenues de rigor. Or has it made it in
the Chains - Borders, Barnes and who's left? Can we assume it's on Amazon?
Or?

And, to top it all off, does modesty prevent you from a quote or two from
any hot, fresh reviews that aren't obvious plugs?

Your cheery friend,

For marxists, read "Maoists".  And "Libertarians" should be capitalized, so as to distinguish between a fully realized philosophic viewpoint (lc) as opposed to a party or faction (UC).

From a distance (a lengthy and indifferent one), libertarians and marxists look awfully similar.

Joel raises a good point about upping the threat. I agree completely. One of the
more heartening things I read in the past few years was an interview with
Charles Bernstein, who said "I want an 'unpopular' poetry of 'anaffirmation'
that expresses confusion, anger, ambiguity, distress, fumbling, awkwardness."
Bernstein concludes that interview citing his poem "Don't Be So Sure (Don't Be
Saussure)" as an example for what he discusses there. I like the description he
gives of an unpopular poetry, and so forth, but I'm not 'so sure' whether this
one really meets up to the description. I do think, though, that such a poetry
as he describes could take things to another place entirely.

Steve,

You can get the book directly from Soft Skull or you can buy the book in
many bookstores, including some of the chains.  Barnes and Nobels in NYC
has it face up in several stores, likewise in some Bay Area bookstores (the
cover is a sell in its own right).  You can also order it via
Amazon,  Powell's and the other on-line sources.  Soft Skull has become a
major small publisher -- and to be published by them indicates to most
bookstores that the book is edgy, as Wanda Phipps can also attest.


>And, to top it all off, does modesty prevent you from a quote or two from
>any hot, fresh reviews that aren't obvious plugs?


Few official reviews have appeared yet.  A very positive review in
"Creative Loafing" in Atlanta, for one, which focused on the religious
dimensions.  It would be a joy and a delight if anyone on this list writes
a review.  The book is advertised as a novel, but it's a hybrid of poetry
and fiction.  Woody Lewis, a Bay Area novelist, wrote a very perceptive
review on the Amazon site.  I copy it below.


Obenzinger is that rare combination of novelist, narrative historian, and
social commentator who weaves a captivating and relevant story. This hip
blend of prose and a sprinkling of meta-poetry (generated in command line
interface interludes that really do serve to punch things along) is a
milestone on the order of Breton's "Nadja". Think James Joyce meets Tom
Waits and Charles Bukowski. Really! He combines mythical parent-child
musings with portraits of a cyber-Skid Row, the Philippine origins of a
sect that worships the Nike "swoosh" logo, the journey of Danny DeVito on
the cusp of a physical labyrinth, and religious metaphors that manage to
encompass Jonah and Jeffrey Dahmer in a visceral counterpart to Dante's
Inferno. Here is a deftly told tale that continues Obenzinger's expert use
of the unreliable narrator that I first observed in his estimable work
"Cannibal Eliot and the Lost Histories of San Francisco", which I also
heartily recommend (there is even another girl embedded in a wall). Mark
Twain's America has been updated with observations informed by Obenzinger's
real-life stint teaching the Yurok Indians. He is the ultimate
meta-narrator, who jumps in and out of his own story with startling ease
and grace as he sows and then reaps a matrix of clues, symbolic
associations, and point of view shifts that somehow make perfect sense.
Behind these supple movements is the weight of a Stanford professor of
American studies, Obenzinger's "other" job, where he ponders notions of
Judeo-Christian paradigms with an original brand of scholarship. I
literally felt I wanted to scan this book into a text file so I could run
searches on it, surely the type of symbolic crossword that already exists
in the author's mind.

A must read, and a great story.

Here's a question I am sure many readers of this list know more about than I
do.  I am looking for references for a student of mine who wants to learn
more about Slam  poetry, and perhaps even trace some sort  of link from the
Oral performances of those like the Beats to what  has happened in the oral
performance scene of more recent years.


 Can anyone guide me to names, books, resources? I'm looking  for things to
suggest.


Thanks for your time--

egregious – posts I, for one, would be willing to
commend the effort.

Perhaps there is a history or dynamics I’m unaware of,
but I don’t understand why you’d speak to a poet on
this list in such a manner.

rather than simply the beats, look at street corner and labor
oratory, participatory performance cultures in West African/syncretic
US and New World traditions, etc.  Check out the first Nuyorican
anthology from the 1970s (Nuyorican Poetry), the multicultural scene
of the Bay Area 1970s/ (Time to Greez!), Black ARts Movement
anthologies (Black Fire, Understanding the New Black Poetry, etc),
Caribbean poetry traditions (VoicePrint)

I don't know of any books specifically, but Marc Smith in Chicago, who still
(I believe) hosts the Uptown Poetry Slam at the Green Mill (corner of
Lawrence and Broadway) takes credit for inventing the performance genre (in
the mid '80s, I think) as a way of getting poetry away from celebrating the
poet and towards celebrating the audience.

I've asked him if he thought he was drawing anything from the poetry
readings of the Beat Generation. He said he was more interested in the
kindred spirit between the Slams and the Folk Music.

Looks like there's a decent amount of information, as well as some books, on
Smith's website: www.slampapi.com.

If you only buy one Canadian poetry anthology culled from broadsides and
chapbooks, created by the most dangerous (in a good way) and hardest working
poet in Canada, let it be Groundswell. An eclectic buffet of Canadian
poetry with too many stars to list, Groundswell also includes a lengthy
bibliography that fascinates, plus a superlative introduction by Stephen Cain.

I don't know Richard Taylor from a bar of soap, but I'm sure he is a "good
sort".  But it's not his abstraction that Andrew was objecting to, but his
lack of civility.

I respectfully disagree.  I am most certainly packing most of the winners
into one camp.  And I've reached my conclusion after searching most of them out,
and reading their poetry, carefully.  For the most part, they are
interchangeable.  Worse, many of the lines in said poems are downright precious to the
point of gag.  Most of these winners are merely repeating worn out formulae.
They may be technicians, but I can't accept that they are poets.  And yes, I've
also packed Ron into a camp (given that the L=A=N=G=U=G=E thing has been around
for a while), the one whose members at least try to do something different,
to stand out, i.e., to serve the art, to care about its progress, to care that
it does, in fact, progress.

Dear Friends and Supporters of Critical Art Ensemble and freedom of
knowledge and research: I

am sending you this appeal for donations to the CAE Defense Fund
because it is

almost depleted and we are facing large bills in the coming months. The
August

bill for legal research and preparation of motions was over $10,000. The

court has now set a hearing on defense motions for January 11, 2005.
The outcome

of this hearing will determine whether or not there is a trial,
however, there

is only a very small chance that there will not be a trial. There seems
to be

a strong determination on the part of the prosecution to pursue this
case. It

is in all our interest that a strong defense is mounted and that we show

solidarity at this moment. So I appeal to you to think of this as your
Christmas

contribution. I'm hoping we can each give at least $10.


Please make checks in any amount out to: "CAE Defense Fund"

Dear Msz Croggon  and Alison & A Loefftwafwenn

It's ok Msz - you're ok for a sheila.

Your essay on The Enlightenment (and Raptor) was very enlightening - to be
honnest I was getting out of my depth - I will try to stick to crosswords.
Alan has me knackered - he's nearly as abstruse as Barrett Watten or me mate
Ron S. *

To the other bloke - Andrew Loetvwenn (strange name - everyone should be
Smith,Jones, Bush or Taylor - have proper American or British names): I'm
aware of my "bad" spelling but I'm not a good type(keyboarder) and my spell
check flogtoggle machine doesn't alawys pick up my blunders. Remember I'm
using Kiwi English. I apologise for thus being egregious

* "One's wonder and amazement and admiration and excitement at or of a thing
(or a work of literature,mathematics,art etc) is directly proportional to
one's bafflement." Wittgenstein.**

** I apoligise for this mention of W as I really havent read alot of his
works - only a strange book he wrote about mathematics and logic etc
(sometimes therein is argued that 1+1 =1 which of course is total nonsense
but W is a very interesting Philogoler I know ( well,  I have heard he is or
was)) - which in fact I have for sale online.....***

****To be honnest I only red a few parts of tahttt book...

***** Of course you know I dont have Wittgenstein for sale only his book -
his brother ((the piannaa player....} lost an arm and there are endless - or

I actually dont know that much  - the above is true as it goes - I returned
to Uni age of 40 after years as labourer etc then a lineman and family man
but
started writing and reading again (literature etc) when I was 40 and  so -
yes I am eager to learn things and admit I am baffled by a lot but being
baffled can be good - I 'm being serious here - and I often look up the
answers to my poems after I have written them

Hi,

Once again Thanksgiving is being celebrated in a menu poem series, this =
years special guest is Kent Johnson

http://www.blazevox.org/books/thanksgiving.htm

This menu series is for a gathering of friends from around the globe to =
join in for a poetic feast and celebrate one of our favorite poets. Kent =
has made a tremendous impact on so many of our lives that it is fitting =
to honor him on our American holiday of thanksgiving. There is also a =
limited edition printing of this poem, only 25 copies being produced -- =
all for only $10 this will help gather much needed advertising dollars =
to help this little press grow.

http://www.cafepress.com/blazevox.14362168

Have a happy and healthy holiday weekend :-)


Excelsior

Best, Geoffrey

i'd write more than you'd read it but you've got to see it
today tried to find some way to project clean from a laptop at Millennium
no such luck, blurred images all the way around s-video out
the mpegs came through ok all thirty seconds they went through final cut
skipping that stage the image disappeared altogether
show in three days trying to get some sort of dvd together
downloaded compressor software for this or that the files don't play
play in winmedia or some such not in dvd
Leslie's making a 78 hour burn and maybe and maybe not
so maybe back to square one minidv of course the quality's not there
not anywhere such limited bandwidth
just about impossible to do much with it in terms of playing around
i can mumble with the microphone with my usual desperation
make people believe this is what they came for
oh oh the sheer beauty of it all
my whole life's interoperable
you can make an image heave though
what you can't do in real life make mountains and valleys
values skewed and screwed

Because all "the opther arts" to one extent or another involve money whereas=

poetry is the only medium wherte that connection is zero. Therefere, the ide=
a=20

of a monetary award is a meaningless concept, as the awards or reviews in Th=
e=20

News York times indicate.

Murat >>

Murat (and anyone else reading this),

If you look way back through the Poetics archives, you'll find I once argued=
=20
likewise.  We agree as far as this goes.  However, I think something more is=
=20
in play.  Neither music (serious music) nor dance is self-supporting.  Both=20=
are=20
developed primarily within the academic arena, and depend on government=20
grants.  Yet the demand for innovative performances is there, and awards are=
 given=20
to those who meet the demand.  Not so with poetry, it seems.

Something is profoundly amiss with those who own the means of poetry=20
production.  Our best critics continue to privilege poetry that is in some w=
ay=20
progressive.  Yet most publishers (and NYT reviewers) emphasize the derivati=
ve.  It's=20
not as if this old fogey art sells better than the more sophisticated, up to=
=20
date product.  I doubt that the sort of thing represented by most of the NEA=
=20
winners is outselling Charles Bernstein, or Allen Ginsberg, or Frank O'Hara,=
 or=20
Ezra Pound, or John Ashbery (another exception that proves the rule).  For=20
some reason, a lot of poets just aren't connected to a language/tone appropr=
iate=20
to their times, and they're being rewarded for it.  It's embarrassing.

Look, the $20,000 is important, sure.  It permits artists to take some time=20
off from whatever work they do and focus on their art.  That's a good thing.=
 =20
But it should be reserved for those poets who are pushing the art form forwa=
rd,=20
not running in place, especially if the place is the distant past.

But it isn't just about the money.  The NEA boasts that an award confers=20
prestige.  If this is true, then the NEA is deliberately headlining old news=
. This=20
is very bad for the art form, not to mention the reputation of the agency. =20=
I=20
can't think of a better strategy for killing poetry.

If we can expect more of the same in the future, then I must agree with thos=
e=20
who argue that the NEA should be dismantled, at least that part of it that=20
awards grants to individual writers.  Right now they're doing much more harm=
=20
than good.

standing for the lost cause
at the edge of my own tracks
waiting there for Gilgamesh
a defender of the flesh
there before the thorny crown
the bees have gathered 'round
the ax is laid into the oak
the gods have tumbled down
children of that Hebrew king
of mind, of blood, of both
all come to open Babylon
to split from loin to mouth
standing in the battle
naked, sharp, and sweet
bleeding on the ground
before the sandaled feet
the bodies of two brothers
laying side by side
wilting in the sun
no coin on any eye
walking through Jerusalem
I saw that Jesus house
laid out on a hillside
split from loin to mouth
I saw a westward river
completely filled with dead
flowing in and out the mouth
of every human head
I knew that it was bloody
I tasted without shame
I recognized the face
I knew the other name
I became an island
the water went around
the Christ became the Babylon
and cut his own tree down

4
floating in the darkness
higher than the sun
I fall through every window
I blacken every light
the truth was in confusion
we are born out of a night
the mind has spilled the blood
the blood has drowned the mind
back before the tree
before the fallen star
an infant spoke to me
saying "none of us are free"
though I tipped his glowing cradle
and dashed him to the ground
my brothers fell upon me
and trampled out my sound
let the baby faces
fill up the final sky
the is no revelation
not condemned to die
there will be no memory
of ancient paradise
there is no recollection
that will not die a Christ
just above the water
I watch the dead float by
Jesus after Jesus
in the twinkling of an eye
all the floating bodies
may rise without regret
when the answer that they died for
becomes what they forget
spitting in the wind
off the bridge at Channel Bay
crumpled on a corner
in the snow Thanksgiving Day

I wish I had some answers, but I don't. Like governments in general, I look
at the NEA as an institution that in no way supports my interests or
addresses my concern. I'd love to have an NEA notch in my gun, but knowing
who gets the awards, I remind myself that completing pointless paperwork is
a waste of time. The last time I looked, the head of NEA was a poet who'd
most likely favor the kind of poets you've described. If Reagan attempted to
bury the artistic and social gains of the 60s, Bush and his administration
seem to be burying the gains of the 50s. Maybe they'll air Dobie Gilis with
Maynard G. Krebs edited out of the scripts. Maybe June Cleaver will be
restored to her former prominence. I don't want to eat white bread, so I
make my own, as you know. Oddly, jazz fares better. It's abstract, so you
can't box it in the way you can works of language, whose preferentiality
could make for controversy. And it doesn't have naked bodies on its CD
covers. Just keep working beneath the underground. A lot of the time I
pretend I'm a secular monk writing for a more enlightened time than the
present. I'm not opposed to raising some hell, though.

Hi Vernon,

I'm with you, and I couldn't have put it better.  It's June Cleaver poetry.

You know, this poetry biz has become a lot like the psychic reading sham.
Each of these psychic services provides a truckload of people who can read the
future.  Who knew there were so many psychics in the country?!!?

Seems like Creative Writing Programs have similarly funneled a few hundred
thousand "poets" into the society.  Pardon me if I can't believe that all these
people, including most of the winners of awards, are poets.  Technicians, yes.
 Craftsman, yes.  But not poets.

Bill,

I've always had mixed feelings about college classes in Creative Writing. As
an undergrad whose fiction combined Naked Lunch and Catch-22, my creative
writing prof told me he didn't think the fusion worked well. In retrospect,
I may have been an unpolished candidate for the Fiction Collective, had I
lived in NYC instead of Storrs, CT in the mid-60s. Twenty years ago, I took
a Poetry Workshop with Brendan Galvin at Central Connecticut State
University. (This was many years before Ravi Shankar arrived there.) One
student asked me why I dropped a line in a poem. I bit my tongue instead of
saying "What's the big deal? Pound did it in 1911, maybe earlier." The class
also had five women poets who signed up for the workshop every semester and
held their own workshops off-campus when Galvin wasn't teaching. To me, most
of them seemed to write in Galvin's style. They were good poets, but the
advice they gave me always seemed to be the opposite of what my poems need
to make them work.

So, for the most part, I stay away from workshops. Isolation may not help
you network, but it keeps your style unique. Generally, in my experience,
too many students in writing workshops begin to write in the same mold. I've
also seen this among jazz students; their technique is very advanced, but
their ideas are derivative in too many cases. I've always thought art was
about uniqueness, about having a distinctive voice, like reading a sentence
of Burroughs, Olson or Bruce Andrews or hearing one measure of Monk or
Coltrane and knowing exactly who it is. Even with the "death of the author"
I think one should be able to identify the corpse. What you're (we're)
describing is the literary equivalent of a mass burial.

Best,

Vernon

Since Harry Nudel posted a couple of weeks ago an excerpt from Iris =

book, The Rape Of Nanking, I thought I would forward this from the San
Francisco Chronicle.

Published on Tuesday, November 23, 2004 by the San Francisco Chronicle
Unbearable Sadness of Others' Pain
by Laurie Barkin
=A0

Iris Chang, the 36-year-old author of "The Rape of Nanking: The =
Forgotten
Holocaust of World War II," immersed herself a decade ago in the stories =
of
those who had survived the period in 1937 when Japanese soldiers invaded =
a
city in China and slaughtered 300,000 people. More recently, Chang
interviewed survivors of the Bataan Death March. After listening to the
stories of American survivors in Kentucky, she suffered a breakdown and =
was
hospitalized for three days. She returned home to the Bay Area, where,
despite therapy and medication, she committed suicide Nov. 9.

Compassion fatigue. Secondary trauma. Vicarious traumatization. These =
are
the terms used to describe what happens to empathic people like Chang =
who
lose their way home after bearing witness to stories of man's inhumanity =
to
man. After five years of working as a psychiatric nurse consultant on a
trauma unit, I began experiencing nightmares, palpitations, shortness of
breath and an ever-growing fear for my children's safety. Then, I =
attended a
trauma conference where I heard the term "vicarious traumatization" for =
the
first time. My symptoms became understandable and I knew that a break =
from
my work was necessary.

Trauma professionals talk about exposure to traumatic events in terms of
"dose." Recent developments in trauma research allow us to map changes =
in
the brain that occur as a result of trauma. Even secondary exposure,
especially the strong dose that Chang accumulated over time, may cause
observable changes. Cops, firefighters, therapists, reporters and =
frontline
health-care workers are also at high risk.

Treatments are available. Taking steps to reduce stress before symptoms
appear is even better. This includes a supportive work environment, =
harmony
at home, regular exercise, balancing work with pleasurable activities =
and
time spent with friends, especially ones who make you laugh.

Mourners said that Chang was a person who "felt others' pain intensely" =
and
that she "wouldn't take time off." Another said, "For Iris, no problem =
was
unsolvable." Maybe that's what happened. Iris Chang confronted the =
reality
of evil in our world and died trying to do something about it. I imagine =
how
the voices haunted her nights and trespassed into her days; how each =
story
pulled her in deeper; how she made herself bear the unbearable in order =
to
give words to unfathomable feelings; how she absorbed the suffering of
others so that we may learn to be better human beings.

The only problem is that we don't want to listen. We don't want to hear. =
We
don't want to believe. Talking about feelings has never been the fashion =
in
this country. We would rather medicate them or drown them in alcohol. We =
are
not taught how to care for the emotional needs of others. We are
uncomfortable when someone we know expresses pain or sorrow. We avoid =
such
situations because we fear we will say the wrong thing or become =
emotionally
overwhelmed ourselves. But acknowledgement, care and comfort are what =
people
who bear witness need. Sometimes though, even the cushion of a loving =
family
and devoted friends isn't enough to rescue those who have descended deep
into the pain of others.

Iris Chang illuminated the lives of many people, but in the process, she
lost the light of life within herself. Like the firefighters at ground =
zero
after the Sept. 11 attacks, she sifted through the remains of tragedy
without a break, without concern for her own mental health. We need to
nurture people like her who have dedicated their lives to seeking truth =
and
in so doing, risk losing their way home. We must offer them respite from
their work, feed them with appreciation, listen to their feelings and =
drag
them away when they get too close to the maw of despair.

Laurie Barkin (barkinbro@sbcglobal.net), a psychiatric clinical nurse
specialist, is writing a book about her work with survivors of trauma.

I don't know if any of you have noticed, but the phrase "Sunni Triangle"
seems to have been summarily replaced by the phrase "triangle of death"
across the board in the media.  I wondered how in the heck this
happened, how journalism could go from an even keeled phrase to a
jingoistic one.  So I traced the history of the phrase "triangle of
death" in lexis/nexis, and here are the results:

BODY:
The Guatemalan army, acting to consolidate a near total victory over
leftist guerrillas, is moving many Indian peasants to ''model villages''

in what could lead to the final conquest of the proud Mayas.

In the mist-shrouded mountains of Quiche province 78 miles northwest of
Guatemala City sits Acul, the first of the new towns built with Indian
labor under army supervision.

Acul lies between the Quiche towns of Nebaj, Chajul and Cotzal, which
form
the points of a region that was dubbed the ''Triangle of Death'' during
a
bloody counterinsurgency three years ago. Other model towns have been
built along the Mexican border.

HEADLINE: Tangshan quake: Nature, man combine in disaster

BYLINE: By RON REDMOND

DATELINE: TANGSHAN, China

BODY:
Tears welled up in an old woman's eyes as she recalled the hot July
night
10 years ago when the sky filled with thunder, the earth convulsed and
242,000 people were left dead or dying in 23 terrifying seconds.

''Everyone here has a story to tell,'' whispered a young municipal
official as he watched the old woman fight back tears. ''No one who
lived
through that earthquake has forgotten.''

Nevertheless, a decade after one of the worst earthquakes in history
demolished the city of Tangshan, the full story of what happened has yet

to emerge.

Tangshan residents tell of an eerie light in the northwest sky and a
sound
''just like 100 steam engines whistling'' that pierced the pre-dawn
stillness just before the temblor struck at 3:42 a.m.

Most of the city's 1 million residents were sound asleep, which
accounted
for the huge death toll. About 148,000 people died in Tangshan itself.
The
other 94,000 casualites occurred in a densely populated ''triangle of
death'' bordered by Tangshan and the cities of Tianjin and Peking, 162
miles to the west.

After getting homesick, the triangle of death moves from China back to
its

terrorism, but rather than returning to Sicily it takes residence in
Rome:

HEADLINE: Human Rights Ambassador Accuses Castro Of Cover-Up

BYLINE: By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:
Cuban jails where political prisoners have been kept naked in windowless

rooms are being altered to make them appear more humane to outside
investigators, a U.S. human rights official said Wednesday.

Ambassador Armando Valladares, U.S. representative to the U.N. Human
Rights Commission, made the accusation and released photographs of
prisoners and their cells he said were smuggled out of one prison by
Cuban
dissidents.

Valladares, who himself was a prisoner of Cuban leader Fidel Castro for
22
years before he was released in 1982 and allowed to emigrate to the
United
States, said some of the worst jail cells have been dismantled in a
prison
near Havana but others remain in more than 200 jails throughout the
country.

"Real changes are not possible, because that would mean the end of the
dictatorship," said Valladares, speaking in Spanish through a
translator.
He was appointed to the Geneva-based human rights commission by
President
Reagan earlier this year. Castro expressed outrage at the appointment,
labeling Valladares a terrorist.

The photos showed a wall of windowless metal doors and the interior of
dank cells with hole-in-the-floor toilets. Valladares said the cells,
including one dubbed "the triangle of death," were all torn down shortly

after the pictures were taken.

BODY:
Dick Gregory and Father George Clements announced today that they would
begin a 40-day fast to highlight America's drug crisis.

"We're appealing to America," said Gregory, "to join with us in a major
effort to mobilize this nation to new heights of concern and
consciousness
in the war against drugs."

At a news conference held at the Security National Bank in Shrevesport,
Gregory was joined by Chicagoan Clements, founder of One Church, One
Child, a nationally acclaimed child adoption organization, and Wesley
Godfrey, president of Security National Bank.

"The drug crisis deserves serious attention from all Americans who wish
to
reach out and touch the victims of drugs," said Clements. "Only our
caring
and our love can alleviate the pain and suffering drugs have afflicted
on
all of us.

"Who among us," said Clements, "what family, what neighborhood, has not
been touched by the ugly presence of drugs, the nicotine habit or
alcohol
addiction."

Gregory called drugs, nicotine and alcohol "a triangle of death." "Its
destruction respects no boundary," he said. "It transcends ideological
differences, it strikes the extremely gifted, the rich and famous, the
poverty stricken: It is a cause of broken families and obliges wayward
children."

clearly the triangle of death is becoming a sort of catch-all foreboding

phrase, clearly based on the Bermuda triangle.  It's in two places in
Italy, not only in terrorism but also in natural disasters, substance
abuse, and inevitably, by 1989, love triangles. Then it makes its move
to
the Islamic world, particularly in relation to "Fundamentalists" in
Algeria, in the post-Soviet looking-for the-new-official-enemy 1992:

HEADLINE: Fundamentalists Claim 30,000 Arrested in Crackdown

DATELINE: ALGIERS, Algeria

BODY:
Muslim fundamentalists today claimed 30,000 people have been arrested in

the crackdown on their movement by the military-backed government.

The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front said 150 people have been
killed and 700 injured in violence since the government seized power
last
month.

The Friday Tribune, a Salvation Front newsletter, published the figures
covering the last 30 days. Among those reported held were 200
fundamentalist mayors, 28 regional assembly leaders and 109
parliamentary
deputies.

Fundamentalists previously said 14,000 people were arrested Feb. 7-14
during confrontations between party faithful and security forces.
According to the government, 50 people were killed, 200 injured and
5,000
arrested in that period. The government has issued no overall figures on

detentions and casualties.

The Salvation Front newsletter said 43 women were arrested. It said some

former soldiers were detained, but provided no details.

The fundamentalists said the dead included seven babies smothered by
tear
gas and an infant who was shot.

Military leaders declared a state of emergency Feb. 9, about a month
after
forcing the president to resign and canceling elections that seemed
certain to give fundamentalists control of Parliament.

The ruling High State Committee has begun proceedings to ban the Islamic

Salvation Front while arresting most of its leaders and many supporters.

Officials have established detention camps throughout the country,
including at least three in the Sahara Desert.

The Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights on Sunday urged that

the detainees be freed before April, when desert temperatures can reach
122 degrees. The league said the desert camps are in the "triangle of
death."

U.S. claims linking Iran to drug production are without foundation, the

Qodratollah Assadi told the Teheran Times the allegations were
politically
motivated and in line with Washington's "hostile policies" towards the
Islamic Republic.

The U.S. assistant secretary of state, Robert Gelbard, has accused Iran
and some other countries of failing to make adequate efforts in fighting

drug trafficking. In a report by the State Department, Iran was also
listed as a major drug producing and transit country.

Assadi said Iranian activities against drug trafficking had been
acknowledged by international organizations, such as the United Nations
Drug Control Programme.

He said Iran had set up 170 control posts along the 1,700-kilometre
border
with Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is called the "Triangle of Death"
in
Iran because it is where most of the region's druck trafficking occurs.

HEADLINE: MANO RIVER WOMEN URGE LEADERS TO TALK PEACE

BYLINE: PETER KAHLER, PANA CORRESPONDENT

BODY:
Monrovia, Liberia (PANA)- The Mano River Women Peace Network (MARWOPNET)

is calling on leaders of the region to "urgently dialogue on the
deteriorating security" of the sub-region, a statement published here
Monday said.

The women renewed their appeal to the leaders of Guinea, Liberia and
Sierra Leone, which make up the Mano River Union (MRU), to implement the

15th protocol of 8 May 2000 on peace and security the three leaders
signed.

MARWOPNET, comprising women from the three states, said it wanted the
leadersto reactivate the Mano River Union (MRU) secretariat and
implement
the MRU Declaration.

Over 40 women from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have been here
attending a week-long workshop on peace-building and leadership
training.

The women resolved to intensify their Society-Liberia-Women efforts to
bring peace and reconciliation, and to encourage and engage in dialogue
at
all levels until peace is restored to the sub-region.

They appealed to the international community to "join in ensuring a
stable, healthy and peaceful environment for ourselves and our
children."
MARWOPNET, the statement said, was formed in Abuja, Nigeria May 2000 for

the purpose of networking and collaborating in the quest for peace,
protection of human rights and development in the MRU basin.

It was officially launched at the weekend in Monrovia and its officers
elected and inducted into office.

Madam Kaba Hadja Daraba of Guinea was elected president, Theresa Sherman

of Liberia, first vice president and Agnes Taylor-Louise of Sierra
Leone,
second vice president.

Sierra Leone will serve as the seat of the MARWOPNET secretariat.

Ruth Caesar of Liberia is chairman on resource mobilisation, former
ambassador to Liberia and Sierra Leone, Danke Daikhabi of Guinea, is
chairperson on advocacy.

Rosaline M'Carthy of Sierra Leone heads the programme committee,
Davidetta
Lansanah of Liberia chairs the communication and media committee, while
Georgette Safo chairs resource management and finance.

Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have been entangled in a web of
accusations and counter-accusations about each other harbouring
dissidents
to destabilise the other.

The other two MRU states have repeatedly charged Liberia's president
Charles Taylor was supporting rebel activities in their countries, but
Taylor, a former rebel, retorts by laying the same charge at their feet.

The MRU, which is an economic grouping, has as a result of rebel
activities been thrown into a triangle of death and destruction, spewing

out one of the largest refugee crisis in recent years, UNHCR officials
say.

HEADLINE: Social activism is Wednesday's topic at Baptist national
convention

BYLINE: By Tim Funk, Ken Garfield and Jay Parsons

BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C._Baptists on Wednesday began heeding one pastor's call
for
African American churches to return to their activist roots.

"You've got to hit the streets and raise hell just like you did with
civil
rights," said pastor Tom Diamond of Jacksonville, Fla. "History has
shown
that nothing happens in this country unless the church takes aggressive
leadership."

Some 60,000 Baptists are in town this week to learn more about what the
Bible says. Organizers of the National Baptist Convention USA's Congress

of Christian Education have upped earlier crowd estimates by 10,000.
That's probably not surprising to uptown commuters caught in traffic
jams
and long restaurant lines this week.

A powerful strain running through many of the 200 programs is that it's
not enough to learn about Scripture. At a workshop on HIV/AIDS
ministries,
and at an outdoor service off South Tryon Street, the focus was on
putting
the Scripture into practice.

After the AIDS workshop, Diamond said he's going home to Jacksonville to

start a hunger strike until city officials pay more attention to the
issue
in the black community.

After a class on courage, the Rev. James Magee Jr. said he's headed back

to Moss Point, Miss., to promote an anti-smoking program for youth _
even
if it raises rancor in his tobacco-rich state.

"We've got to stop being afraid," Magee said. "This is the Lord's work."

All over the packed Charlotte Convention Center, pastors and lay leaders

talked about congregations becoming more aggressive and creative.

The Rev. Clifford Jones of Charlotte's Friendship Missionary Baptist _
official host of the convention _ said his church is planning housing
for
the elderly at its Beatties Ford Road campus.

At the HIV/AIDS workshop, Miami pastor George McRae said it's time
churches dealt with what he called the "triangle of death" _ AIDS,
substance abuse and so many black men in prison. The only way to do
that,
he said, is to get past the fear of dealing with real issues.

HEADLINE: A DRIVE ON THE WILD SIDE THROUGH IRAQ'S "TRIANGLE OF DEATH"

BODY:


FALLUJAH, Iraq, Sept 17 (ONASA - AFP) - On a pedestal still bearing the
outlines of a portrait of Saddam Hussein, flyers have sprouted that warn

drivers to stay away from US convoys. Watch out: you're nearing the
"triangle of death." It's a small intersection west of Baghdad linking
the
towns of Fallujah, Khaldiyah and Ramadi, and the Habbaniyah Lake, an
area
that has seen frequent attacks on US convoys as well as local score
settling. Here was where the police chief of Khaldiya met his death
Monday, cut down by three masked gunmen who riddled his car with bullets

as he was returning to Fallujah, a Sunni hotspot 50 kilometers (30
miles)
west of Baghdad. Khaldiyah police sergeant Fuad Fadel, who was wounded
in
the attack, knows the area well: "It's the spot the people call the
triangle of death." Lying in a hospital bed here, Fadel recounted the
roadside ambush of his boss, Colonel Khdayyir Ali Mukhlif, as the
officer
was driving back to his Fallujah home from Khaldiyah, 30 kilometers (19
miles) away. "When we left Khaldiyah, we were preceded by an ambulance
with its siren blaring and a motorbike, which signaled to the assailants

that we were coming," said Fadel, recovering alongside another wounded
colleague. The attack came amid a spate of violence around this town,
still a hotbed of support for ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein,
including a murky incident Friday that left nine Iraqi security men dead

from US gunfire. But Fadel said the assassination of Mukhlif had nothing

to do with the US occupation. "The chief of police dealt only with the
arrest of thieves and criminals," he insisted. Mukhlif's family also see

the shooting as a local affair, saying he had drawn the wrath of car
thieves by grabbing back stolen government vehicles. They swear to
avenge
his death themselves if need be. If Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, 175
kilometers (110 miles) north of Baghdad, resisted the US-led invasion
from
the start, anti-US feeling came later to the Sunni tribes of Anbar
province west of the capital. It now runs high among the tribes here
with
a strong tradition of vendetta, fueled by clashes with the newly arrived

Americans in April that left 16 townspeople dead. Friday's "friendly
fire"
deaths intensified the anger. Drivers leaving Fallujah run into flyers
that warn them "for the last time to keep a distance from American
convoys
and vehicles that might be attacked and destroyed at any moment by the
mujahedeen." The flyers are stuck on a pedestal over the remnants of
portraits of Saddam, one in Bedouin dress and the other in a business
suit. "We have warned drivers that we cannot be responsible for their
lives if they don't heed these warnings of the Islamic mujahedeen," a
policemen, who asked not to be named, said as he directed traffic. There

is no way he will take down the flyers. "Why remove them? I would like
to
see more warnings like this. We will continue to fight the Americans
until
they leave," he said. But residents near the "triangle of death" are
thinking about leaving before the Americans. "Each time there is an
attack, the Americans come and question us about the identities and
names
of the attackers," complained Abed Abbas al-Issawi. "Each time I am
afraid
my house will be hit when the Americans respond." Issawi is giving
serious
thought to moving. He smiled as he said: "In five days, maybe you won't
see me here anymore."

I'm not involved here in NZ but similar problems issues arise. I rather over
reacted at one stage saying that there was a "conspiracy of dullness" here
by "official" poetry magazines!! But  it  almost seems that the kind of
poetry/poetics Bill is advocating or pointing toward should be awarded is
(or could be placed) almost, in separate category - so thinking of a music
festival over here - I heard that they award for various categories
("classical" music is separate) so that there was county, jazz and pop etc
I'm not involved in music but perhaps we have to recognise that the language
based poetry or the poetries that have derived from them and the NY/San Fran
and other schools etc are somehow in a different category - but how do you
decide that category - it may not thus be qualitative...

Poetry is not  a great money attractor (poetry isn't sexy) - but also there
is a psychotically and cultural...maybe philosophic barrier - those who own
the means to poetry production (Bill's phrase) are often conservative (with
many exceptions) - not necessarily poetical - although I suppose there is a
poetical -political link if politics is used in the wider sense.... Silliman
and Bernstein,  for many, are still very "crazy", strange, etc but to others
they have "made it" so Bernstein is listed in an encyclopaedia of modern
poetry and Ron Silliman  is (justly famous ) - in his field - that has been
helped (in NZ) by people in the Auckland UNi  eg Wystan Curnow, Michelle
Leggott, Roger Horrocks, (Alan Loney -not a university person per se) Murray
Edmonds etc (also the editor of Poetry NZ Alistair Patterson has pushed
"post-modern" poetry in a kind of long rebellion against British poetry - of
course there is some great stuff done in Britain - it was just we were tied
to tightly to Mother England for ages) and the visits  of Creeley here) but
I imagine that the problems are (as here) still the barriers that somehow
those poets and (eg. many on this list and others) are considered
too"intellectual", too difficult, or to be "showing off", non- referential
etc or whatever - and to some degree the new is feared -almost considered
subversive. That of course begs the question of what is new - avant garde or
innovative etc -maybe its there reason so many earn a living otherwise and
or retreat into Blogs - Blogs are good of course.

We should all be paid US$30,000 a year to be poets only. !!! How to decide
who to pay!!!

The "officialdom" etc always are behind the times - history has shown
endlessly great poets  being neglected / and in the past - before poetry and
music became commercial artists of all kinds even starved to death - even
the great Chess player Schlecter basically starved to death - and a number
of early 20th Cent poets  (eg. Mandelstam was treated badly by the Soviet
regime) - its almost an indicator of quality that one is neglected - with
many exceptions fortunately. One shouldn't seek unfortune!!

Poets of the world - seize the poetic means of production !!!  You have
nothing to lose except.......your complete neglect (perhaps)....

Because all "the opther arts" to one extent or another involve money whereas

poetry is the only medium wherte that connection is zero. Therefere, the
idea

of a monetary award is a meaningless concept, as the awards or reviews in
The

News York times indicate.

Murat >>

Murat (and anyone else reading this),

If you look way back through the Poetics archives, you'll find I once argued
likewise.  We agree as far as this goes.  However, I think something more is
in play.  Neither music (serious music) nor dance is self-supporting.  Both
are
developed primarily within the academic arena, and depend on government
grants.  Yet the demand for innovative performances is there, and awards are
given
to those who meet the demand.  Not so with poetry, it seems.

Something is profoundly amiss with those who own the means of poetry
production.  Our best critics continue to privilege poetry that is in some
way
progressive.  Yet most publishers (and NYT reviewers) emphasize the
derivative.  It's
not as if this old fogey art sells better than the more sophisticated, up to
date product.  I doubt that the sort of thing represented by most of the NEA
winners is outselling Charles Bernstein, or Allen Ginsberg, or Frank O'Hara,
or
Ezra Pound, or John Ashbery (another exception that proves the rule).  For
some reason, a lot of poets just aren't connected to a language/tone
appropriate
to their times, and they're being rewarded for it.  It's embarrassing.

Look, the $20,000 is important, sure.  It permits artists to take some time
off from whatever work they do and focus on their art.  That's a good thing.
But it should be reserved for those poets who are pushing the art form
forward,
not running in place, especially if the place is the distant past.

But it isn't just about the money.  The NEA boasts that an award confers
prestige.  If this is true, then the NEA is deliberately headlining old
news. This
is very bad for the art form, not to mention the reputation of the agency.
I
can't think of a better strategy for killing poetry.

If we can expect more of the same in the future, then I must agree with
those
who argue that the NEA should be dismantled, at least that part of it that
awards grants to individual writers.  Right now they're doing much more harm
than good.

MARC ADORNATO: Few artists in this day and age work along side politicians
such as former Prime Minister Jean Chrètien, Prime Minister Paul Martin, and
former Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, as a Parliamentary videographer -
while creating satirical art videos about George W. Bush, and the social
apocalypse of our times. But Ottawa's New Media Artist Marc Adornato somehow
pulls it off.  From his debut screening in Ottawa – which won him 1st place at
SAW Videos/Ryan Stec/Anne Clarks ‘REMIX’ video competition in 2002 - to his
present international video screenings, numerous awards and grants,
controversial ‘money-shredding’ artwork and experimental performances -
Adornato has been unleashing a fury of Art about our most compelling and
historic times. Visit his website to watch free videos, view his gallery of
artworks, and don't miss his candid/quirky interview with ‘Guerilla.ca’.

MARC LEBLANC, musician and sound artist, recently moved to Ottawa
from Fredericton, New Brunswick where he played in jazz and experimental
music ensembles. He designs sound art installations and is a founding member
of improvised music collective Furnacehour. His enthusiasm and keen ability to
play air guitar cannot cure cancer but one magical student amateur night, it
almost got him kicked out of high school. He considers it the high water mark
of his musical career.

MAX MIDDLE has been playing music, vocalizing sounds, making pictures and
writing for many years. When not in Ottawa, he enjoys touring the garden with
his resident gnome. He is not easily charmed but loves magic. He enjoys
swimming, watching snails gallop, eating green vegetables, sleeping and
dreaming. He has recently been conducting investigations into sound poetry and
improvised music with some very talented collaborators. You might have seen
him perform during the Ottawa Fringe Festival. The Max Middle Sound Project
web site has been updated. There will soon be all kinds of audio and video
files at [www.maxmiddle.com]

JASON SONIER: ja has been involved in music for most of his life, from choirs
in
elementary school, to studying music and performance at Carleton University,
learning flute, bass, guitar and audio engineering on the way.  He learned
hand-percussion from several West African drummers at the Stone Angel
Institute and from other teachers elsewhere as well. He learned Irish whistle,
Irish flute and bodhran over the course of several years of study conducted
through the Irish cultural organization, Ceoltas Ceoltairi Eirin. He has
played these Irish instruments at various traditional sessions about town.  He
spent several years training and working as an audio engineer for both event
and studio production. He has recorded and performed with the Euphoria Blues
Band, Pangur Ban, the Grasshoppa Dance Exchange, the voice-and-percussion
improvisation group Oya, the percussion-based Dejaske Trio and with stage
bands for productions of the Rocky Horror Show and Tommy. He is currently
focusing on his solo projects: summer solstice, black willow and sublingua. He
now plays anything he can get his hands on (he's working on harp, cello and
lap steel), performs his own music and collaborates with modern dancers.
Sometimes, he sleeps.

MIKE WHITE has been experimenting with acoustics and electronics ever since
discovering his first Casiotone in 1984. While residing in Nashville, TN, he
earned a Bachelor's degree in Music Business (maj. Production), gained
significant studio experience as a session drummer and recording engineer, and
produced a self-engineered CD of electronic/hard core/thrash. He is now fully
engaged with the emergence of his label, ALPHAOMEGA X., which carries
his 'iron core' band AZED and his electronic-art project "alphaomega vort x."
The latter has just released his first DVD of Audio-Visual music entitled "The
War Story - 02-11-01". To pay the bills he produces video as well as audio
tracks for video games. Clients include Coors Light, Megabloks.
[www.alphaomegax.com] will be up by Sept 30.

DAVID WILKINSON has been playing music for a very long time: pots and pans,
garage, basement, Humber, Carleton University Bachelor of Music, jazz and
classical guitar, composition, computer music, audio recording, band after
band after band…Now, with queer raw emotion he approaches his art as freely as
possible and with sci-fi intelligence!

> Poets own the means of production in poetry. That's what's different about
> it. It is a very capital light activity.

Murat, how do you figure the factor of "time" into this concept. Many
capitalists might look at the time it takes to write a poem as a form of
"time debting" because the activity does not yield any financial return on
its investment. Indeed, the time for creating the poem has to be supported
by some other relatively "capital heavy" activity - usually a day job of
some sort - whether the post office or a creative writing gig.

Squeezing time in on the corporate dime to write a poem or maintain a blog
becomes an act of rebellion or, at least, employer deception. Charming but
hardly a 'free lunch.'  Somebody or someone else, often unwittingly, is
paying for this.  One side effect from 'time debting' is poets - in my
experience - often feel like duplicitous characters, either guilty or
gleeful for having achieved something behind the back of someone else. Yet
these feelings are also coupled with an anger that one cannot be doing what
one wants to do best with a formal straight up acknowledgement, sanction and
financial support for the work itself. And, in the case of many, there is
the straight up anger for having gone into real financial debt to make poems
(beginning with taking out school loans for a good creative writing
program!)

When Ron Silliman, for example, says he spends 40 hours a week on his job
and 30 on his writing and blog (then there is the wife and twins) that is, I
imagine, a stressed system. Or, maybe not too differently, a poet in a State
college with a required load of four classes and 100 to 150 students, there
is a contradiction of terms. Or the person taking a half time job to make it
possible to write while still be hounded by years of school loan repayments.
The poetry gods are, it seems, rarely kind!

And yet, say in terms of the long run, most of us I imagine are ambivalent
about the idea of a full time career position as poet (as inconceivable as
that may be). There can be long stretches (years) where even though one
identifies oneself as a poet, there is zero writing happening of any value.
In fact dormancy and other kinds of work may be a good thing - at least it
has been for me. A little life in an ego-affirming job (and a good check)
can assuage the fragile esteem issues of maintaining as a poet. Let alone
jacking one into fields that are full of life, challenge and new kinds of
knowledge. I suspect those among us who have good jobs (related to poetry or
not), and jobs that do not exhaust a parallel energy and time for writing
(maybe throw in family and citizen obligations here too) have figured it
out. But most of us, I suspect, will say it is a very hard equation to
sustain and something dear is inevitably sacrificed or, at least, postponed.

NEA. NEA. The money and recognition are no doubt refreshing. (I certainly
would not turn one down) But I can't imagine Charles Olson, or Neidecker, or
Reznikoff - for examples - as exhausting their pipes on getting a grant or
not. A bit of curiosity I have for those who build their career expectations
and solidify their identity as a poet based on whether or not they are given
an NEA.

John Cage: Watercolors, Selected Drawings and Prints



Nov. 18 - Dec. 18, 2004

ZONE: Chelsea Center for The Arts, 601 W. 26th St., Suite #302, NYC



ZONE:chelsea Center for the Arts, presents its second exhibition in 2004
of visual art works by the late avant-garde composer, writer, artist and
philosopher John Cage (1912-1992).

John Cage: Watercolors, Selected Drawings and Prints,* articulates the
relationship of Cage’s watercolor paintings to his important involvement
with printmaking, during which his fourteen year-long (1978 – 1992)
experience at Crown Point Press transformed the traditional discipline of
etching as surely as he had reinvented our idea of music thirty years
earlier. His late-career watercolor paintings were created at the
Mountain Lake Workshop in the rural Appalachian Mountains of Virginia
between 1983 and 1990. They demonstrate, like his graphic works, a
profound sense of beauty not usually associated with Cage’s dismissal of
conventional aesthetics. The watercolors shown here reveal the dynamic
interaction with his graphic art works (mostly unique images), including
the Ryoanji drawings that occupied his attention for eleven years. This
exhibition offers an essential visual component to complement Cage’s
lifelong achievement as America’s foremost avant-garde composer and
artist, and highlights his role as the principal mediator of the
influence of Asian culture and philosophy on his generation and those to
follow. Cage’s visual art, like his writing, brings an even wider
audience to his uniquely pioneering work and contributes to a broader
understanding of his strategic use of “chance operations” in his music,
writing, printmaking and painting as a way to redirect our pre-conceived
and authoritarian attitudes toward the arts.

John Cage: Watercolors, Selected Drawings and Prints


Ray Kass, Guest Curator



Ray Kass is an artist and the founder and director of the Mountain Lake
Workshop of the Virginia Tech Foundation, where John Cage produced his
watercolor paintings between 1983 and 1990. He is Professor Emeritus of
Art at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg,
Virgina.



I became aware of John Cage’s visual artwork and printmaking activities
at Crown Point Press when I had the opportunity to interview him in
1980.1

During the course of our visit, Cage showed me an example of the work he
was involved with at Crown Point, an etching entitled “On The Surface”
(1980 - 1982), and some of the materials employed in the process (cut up
copper etching plates). Cage described how he had used  “chance
operations” with the aid of a computer program derived from the method of
random access of the ancient Chinese book of wisdom, the I–Ching, in
making the complex print. He also described an even more complicated
procedure for another related etching, also still in progress, entitled
“Changes and Disappearances” (1979-82), and that used “chance” to
incorporate an even more various array of imagery.2 It occurred to me
that his etchings had an extraordinary correspondence to the methods he
utilized in composing his music – and that they were visual counterparts
of sorts, related in a manner that one might not have expected (i.e.
Schoenberg’s watercolors, for instance, don’t seem directly related to
his composing anymore than Victor Hugo’s ink drawings and gouaches appear
directly related to his novels). But the connection between Cage’s use of
“chance” methodology in his various kinds of work (composing, writing,
installation & performance art, & now printmaking) made sense in a way
that awakened me to the great scope of his work.

           In subsequent visits with Cage over the next three years he
continued to show me examples of the etchings that he was working on at
Crown Point, including a series entitled Where R = Ryoanji (1983), and a
new group of related drawings. The Ryoanji etchings consist of patterns
of circular overlapping lines incised with a sharp dry point etching tool
around stones placed by Cage’s chance operations on a copper plate. The
Ryoanji drawings utilized the same stones, but they are drawn around with
pencils and are basically simpler in execution than the prints; Cage
worked on them at home intermittently for the rest of his life. He
commented to his friend and agent, Margaret Roeder, that he considered
the Ryoanji drawings as “ a form of meditation”.3

           Before I saw the Ryoanji drawings, I had never sensed a vital
relationship between the tradition of drawing and that of painting and
any of Cage’s earlier graphic arts; in contrast, those works seemed
insistently unconventional in their demonstration of randomly acquired
effects.  Despite the fact that Cage had rendered the Ryoanji drawings in
an unselfconscious, almost automatic way intended to avoid any “personal”
stylistic manner, these works exhibit an implicit quality of hand
gesture, however randomly acquired, and associated with the formal
conventions of drawing. I asked Cage whether, since his early experiences
with painting in the late ‘20s and early ‘30s, he had ever again thought
seriously about painting; he said he had really not had time to consider
it.



*



In spring 1983 I invited John Cage to direct a mycological foray
(mushroom hunt) at Mountain Lake and to give a gallery talk at the
opening of an exhibition of his prints and drawings that I had organized
at nearby Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  During
the several days of the 1983 workshop there were periods of free time to
explore the mountains and rivers of Appalachia. We visited Ripplemead, a
secluded place along the New River where the river stones are
extraordinary.  Cage loved the site and spent much of the afternoon
enthusiastically selecting specimens of the smooth river stones. Many of
the stones he admired were significantly larger than those used for the
Ryoanji drawings but most of them were portable.  We both realized that
the larger sizes of these rounded stones might suggest their use in an
experiment related to that of the Ryoanji drawings, in which he could
employ a wide variety of materials, particularly brushes and water media,
rather than pencils. I commented that the Ryoanji drawings suggested the
possibility of a painting experiment in watercolor that might use the
rocks from the site on the New River. Without dismissing the idea, he
indicated that he was too unfamiliar with the medium and materials to
imagine how to undertake such work – and that he felt unable to organize
the studio facilities that would be necessary.  His response seemed to
indicate that he was being realistic but not closed to such an idea.
During the next few days I resolved to try to create an appropriate
studio situation in which he could acquaint himself with watercolor
materials, and to surprise him with it before his departure. I returned
to the site with my students and gathered many of the larger stones.

           At the conclusion of his visit in 1983 Cage visited my studio,
where I showed him the “studio practice” I had prepared for him the night
before.  It included an ample floor space covered with soft
particleboard, and the 60 or so river rocks gathered the previous day and
now numbered and divided into general size groups of small, medium and
large. I provided a large selection of watercolor brushes each numbered
and arranged in groups according to type and size, a selection of
different kinds of rag papers, a palette of about 26 colors, and
additional tubes of paint and many various containers for mixing paint.
After a brief demonstration of brushes and paint qualities, I encouraged
him to “experiment” by painting around some stones on several “practice”
sheets of bond paper, which he appeared to enjoy. Then Cage took out his
computer generated pages of random numbers based on the I-Ching and began
to create a program for a painting – which was executed in about an hour
– and I drove him to the airport for his trip back to NYC.



*



The experiment in my studio in 1983, and his ongoing development of his
etchings informed and inspired his watercolor painting experiences at the
Mountain Lake Workshop in 1988, 1989, and 1990. Prior to his death in
August 1992, he was planning to return to Mountain Lake to make new
paintings in the following October. In late 1989 I had shown Cage some
examples of how the invisible divisions (or panels) that he often
incorporated into his watercolors (and his composing of music) might
become visible yet subtle elements of future painting experiments – his
curiosity was engaged by this possibility. I believe that had he returned
to the Mountain Lake Workshop in 1992, his watercolors might have
expressed some correspondence with the soft geometric appearance of one
of his final series of etchings at Crown Point Press, HV2 (1992).

           The exhibition, John Cage: Watercolors, Selected Drawings and
Prints, articulates the relationship of Cage’s watercolor paintings to
his important involvement with printmaking. I think that Cage’s fourteen
year-long (1978 – 1992) experience at Crown Point Press transformed our
idea of the traditional discipline of etching as surely as he had
reinvented our idea of music thirty years earlier. His late-career
watercolor paintings demonstrate, like his graphic works, a profound
sense of beauty not usually associated with Cage’s dismissal of
conventional aesthetics. An intrinsic sense of beauty, in fact, is at the
center of the experience that one may have in encountering his work. The
watercolors shown here reveal the dynamic interaction with his graphic
art works (mostly unique images) after 1988, in works such as The Missing
Stone, 9 Stones, and 10 Stones – all produced 1989.

This exhibition offers an essential visual component to complement Cage’s
lifelong achievement as America’s foremost avant-garde composer, and
highlights his role as the principal mediator of the influence of Asian
culture and philosophy on his generation and those to follow. Cage’s
visual art, like his writing, brings an even wider audience to his
uniquely pioneering work and contributes to a broader understanding of
his strategic use of “chance operations” in his music, writing,
printmaking and painting as a way to redirect our pre-conceived and
authoritarian attitudes toward art and life.








NOTES:



1. My visit with Cage was to interview him about the Pacific Northwest
painter and mystic, Morris Graves, with whom Cage had a long friendship,
whose retrospective exhibition I was organizing for the Phillips
Collection. Graves and Cage became close friends in Seattle during the
late 1930’s when Cage took a position as percussionist at the innovative
Cornish School of Art. Graves was a colorful and pivotal figure among a
small and adventurous group of young Seattle artists and involved Cage in
his famous Dada antics as well as introduced him to the Buddhist Temple
in the Yessler district, Asian art, and aspects of the Native American
culture. The Painter Mark Tobey taught at Cornish at that time, and also
became a critical figure in Cage’s artistic development and befriended
the 26 year-old Cage. Our conversation that morning was filled with
discussion about his deep involvement with both Graves and Tobey at a
formative time in his own artistic development – and how Tobey in
particular related to aspects of his current experiments in visual art.
Cage described how Tobey and his paintings had profoundly effected his
“seeing” – his actual perception of the world. The Phillips Collection
project resulted in his traveling retrospective in 1983-84 and my
publication, Morris Graves, Vision of the Inner Eye, (New York: George
Braziller, 1983).



2. The computer program had been developed for him at Cornell University
– in order to more easily allow him to randomly access the 64 Hexagram
structure of the I-Ching without having to go through the process of
throwing stones or sticks. Based on our conversations, it was my
impression that Cage chose the system of random-number access of the I
Ching, rather than the Rand Corporation system, or any other system of
random numbers, as the basis of his own use of indeterminacy in his work,
because it was the most ancient system of random numbers in the world –
and he wanted to point to that in a gesture of cultural affirmation of
its significance – as well as acknowledge the influence of Asian culture
and art on world culture.   After selecting the elements of the work – or
making “choices”, Cage described making Changes and Disappearances  from
eight copper plates that had been cut into 66 various smaller pieces
whose curved shapes were determined by dropping greased string from
various heights onto the plates (as an homage to Marcel Duchamp’s earlier
use of a similar strategy to create “lines”) and straight edges
determined by cutting along lines between chance-determined quadrants, he
described how three types of etching techniques might (according to
chance) be applied to these pieces, as well as photographic images of
drawings from Henry David Thoreau’s journals.

     My (partial) descriptions of processes and materials involved in
Cage’s etchings have been derived from Crown Point Press publications
documenting Cage’s work at the press, particularly, John Cage – Etchings:
1978 – 1982 (Crown Point Press, 1982) containing Paul Singdahlsen’s
writing about On the Surface 1980 – 1982) and Lilah Toland’s notes on
Changes and Disappearances (1979 – 1982), and also Kathan Brown’s book,
John Cage, Visual Art: To SOBER and QUIET the MIND (San Francisco: Crown
Point Press, 2000) and her writing on Where R = Ryoanji (1983). Kathan
Brown’s essays on John Cage have been particularly helpful to me.



3. The Ryoanji etchings consist of patterns of circular, overlapping
lines incised with a sharp dry point etching tool around stones placed by
chance operations on a copper plate. the size of the prints and drawings
as well as the number of stones (15) that he used for their execution are
proportionate with the number of stones and the space in which they are
arranged within the 360 square yards of raked gravel of the Ryoanji
garden. The development of these etchings preceded Cage’s ongoing series
of Ryoanji drawings; both the Ryoanji etchings and drawings were made
approximately during the time that Cage’s was composing the music
entitled Ryoanji (1983-84); although Cage described to author Joan

we poets (as Stephen implies) are never going to be able to do a 40 hour
week per se - Ron does well to do his Blog and work (my hat off for Ron -
seriously)  - sometimes being in work can stimulate you and also give
discipline - but I think a lot of poets are nervously out here or there
(where are we all?) in the dark - as to grants - the one in NZ (probably
similar to NEA - I have never applied for it ever  - and I am on a very low
income - but things are ok, I manage though as my children are grown up etc
and have some resources -but - my most productive time(s) was (were) also a
terrible time(s) after my wife left me (get out the violins) and I went to
Uni (age 40 or so to learn about poetry etc) then for about 10 or so years I
was in a bad way (not because of Uni - University was kind of my "job" great
stimulation - ideas every day - new words like ontological (great word) also
"parse"  and "phenomelogical" (more than technicians)  - some great
lecturers and lectures (some bad) in many departments and in many subjects -
but a lot of grief (probably my own fault)..gone now ..but in that darktime
I was writing a lot - on a Govt benefit (I had one child - one of my
children - in my care for a while) then I borrowed some cash off the Govt
(still owe them - still do - probably will never repay it) - hardly worked -
just managed - bludged off my mother - managed and wrote and got drunk at
readings and then went to hookers after or I didn't - but it was all crazy -
caught drunk by the cops - smashed the car - stupid - black time sometimes -
black - half the time I didn't know what I was writing - grants and
applications are all "official dry stuff"  BUT...I suppose if things had got
really bad (money wise) I may have gone for a grant -inertia prevented me
and also feel (maybe this is romantic nonsense) that we poets are always
(mostly) nervously on the outside crazily chipping - sometimes writing
....it was best when I was just at Uni and not trying to sell books and
reading every week - except I also went through hell, burring hell:
sometimes I was in hell I think: Dante: but I wrote a lot...a lot of crap
but some great stuff too I think...

 I feel we poets will always be on the outer if we are any  good - dark -
dark

and surrounded by the creeleian dark - writing writing writing...then
reading it aloud  -immediate publication - ho! no money ...
  but pleasure - excitement of the moment of the words
For along time didn't believe that - don't believe suffering necessary
(necessarily) - suffering  - just part of the sandwich? - joy also and all
that

[or the miltonic dark - no - yes -   "he miltoned his great madness" ??!!?]

But there are wonderful exceptions - but I mean even eg Wallace Stevens -
well off, good on him - but on the outer - WCW - worked ferociously hard -
still - ultimately on the outside - was recognised - but Zukofsky - yes  -
great family person, great man - erudite - great person -- like that idea -
but on the outside - dark.....maybe - Berrigan - really - think though of
Berryman his suffering (saw his father blow his brains out) (then he was an
alcoholic) great poet I feel tho) -off the bridge -- and Celan - couldn't
get it all out of his mind - the terrible times - off the bridge (in Paris I
think it was) - I was saying Berrigan also on the outer - on the outer
....the outside  - but good father (Berrigan I mean) his son said ...some of
us on the outside some succeed  - we all succeed if we love the craft and
get a buzz from it...

[saw tuis today on the pohutukawa - black with white tufts on their necks
flitting from red flower to red flower - in my backyard - life out there]

But yes - does not belittle the need for "recognition" money etc nothing
wrong with doing well - not saying that - love money (strange!!) -etc and
like Stephen would take money if given but I don't greatly seek it....lol...

The cat is scratching at the door  - egregious cat  - wants in - wants to
sit on my bed - my infinite cat....

Poets own the means of production in poetry. That's what's different about
it. It is a very capital light activity. At least in our world, the
popularity
of an art form increases its overhead.

Execs say writing poetry helps improve their form
Poet-executives fight stress, reclaim individuality, express emotions,
gain stability and transform daily experiences in `strangely
restorative' exercise


By Ann Therese Palmer
Special to the Tribune

November 25, 2004

Ask William R. Fuller, Northern Trust's chief fiduciary officer, to
describe where he's worked for the past 21 years, and he'll tell you he
has an office at the bank's headquarters along LaSalle Street.

Ask that same question of William R. Fuller, author of four poetry
volumes, and he's a mite less literal. His office in downtown Chicago,
surrounded by the "L," is like "a folk tale circled by a train," he
wrote in a poem dedicated to a bank colleague who was retiring.

Like America's current poet laureate, Ted Kooser, who wrote poetry while
working as a Nebraska insurance company executive, Fuller makes a
regular habit of writing poems, usually on his 45-minute train commute.
While it's unclear how many Chicago executives double as poets, it's
safe to say Fuller is not the only wordsmith who views his day job as
the stuff of folk tales.

Poets & Patrons, a Chicago-based poetry writers' support group,
estimates that the metro Chicago area is home to as many as 100
poet-executives.

Fuller, who has a doctorate in English, says setting aside the stresses
of his high-level post to write poetry is "strangely restorative."

"My day's experiences are transformed into something else by the
process," he says. "Don't ask me to explain it. I can't."

Like Fuller, Jared Smith, president of Poets & Patrons, was a college
English major. He became a security consultant to make money but never
stopped composing poems.

Smith views his efforts as an antidote to the pressures of conforming to
organizational norms on the job. Blending successfully into the
workplace inevitably involves giving up some degree of individuality,
Smith notes. "Writing poetry is my way to reclaim that."

The type of poetry Chicago's executives produce varies, he reports, but
it's often related to their occupations. When Robert Frost meets
Dilbert, the angst of the office inevitably spills into verse.

Some find an outlet for passions best left unexpressed at the office.

"It's my way of expressing strong emotions like turmoil or joy," says Al
DeGenova, Chicago-based North American advertising and new media
director for Grohe, a German faucet manufacturer. DeGenova has been
known to transform his transatlantic commutes to Germany into
composition sessions meditating on the nature of family and
relationships.

"My poetry ... helps me create a certain emotional stability by helping
me realize what's worth getting upset about and what isn't," he
explains.

While Kooser commands tens of thousands of dollars in royalties and
reading fees for his poetry, Chicago executives say they aren't in it
for the money.

Fuller says he manages to earn several hundred dollars from his poetry
each year. Gerald Murray, a River Forest corporate annual report and
executive speechwriter, pegs his poetry-related annual income at $1,000,
which includes some payments for readings and reprints in anthologies.

The more tangible benefit, several poets assert, comes in improving
their performance as executives.

Smith has developed a more nuanced way of looking at mundane business
activities, which helps him make better decisions on the job, he says.

When he writes about offices, "I'm hunting for relationships, for how I
relate to people in the business world. Business executives tend to look
at things in a linear way. A leads to B leads to C. Poetry is
non-linear."

That leads to original approaches. "I'm thinking about two or three
things at once and trying to solve two or three different problems by
linking them together in a creative way," Smith said.

Former retailer Susan Pritzker, now president of a local family
foundation, agrees.

"As a poet, I'm more of an observer," says Pritzker, who writes about
relationships and occasionally politics. "I can detach more easily from
a situation. When I make a business decision, I think this makes me more
objective."

Kooser, who retired from the insurance business five years ago, sees
poetry writing as a way of bringing order to life's daily chaos.

"In a stressful and disorderly world, with lots of phone calls and
papers flying in and out, a poem is a place of order," says Kooser,
author of 10 poetry books. "Writing poetry makes my world orderly. It
brings me solace. It's a source of endless entertainment."

What sort of entertainment? In "At The Office Early," Kooser describes a
bank with "ball-point pens popping out of their sockets in a fluffy snow
of deposit slips."

In his poem "The Salesman," the title character's "vinyl shoes" are
"shiny and white as little Karmann Ghias fresh from the body shop"--a
reference to a Volkswagen car produced between 1955 to 1974.

And in "Four Secretaries," Kooser does a little eavesdropping: "All
through the day I hear or overhear their clear, light voices from desk
to desk ... singing their troubled marriage ballads, their day-care,
car-park, landlord songs."

- - -

`A Death at the Office'

The news goes desk to desk

like a memo; Initial

and pass on. Each of us marks

Surprised or Sorry.

The management came early

and buried her nameplate

deep in her desk. They have boxed up

the Midol and Lip-Ice,

the snapshots from home,

wherever it was--nephews

and nieces, a strange, blurred cat

with fiery, flashbulb eyes

as if it grieved. But who grieves here?

We have her ballpoints back,

her bud vase. One of us tears

the scribbles from her calendar.

--From the volume "Sure Signs" by Ted Kooser (University of Pittsburgh
Press, 1980)

- - -

`Four Secretaries'

All through the day I hear or overhear

their clear, light voices calling

from desk to desk, young women whose fingers

play casually over their documents,

setting the incoming checks to one side,

the thick computer reports to the other,

tapping the correspondence into stacks

while they sing to each other, not intending

to sing nor knowing how beautiful

their voices are as they call back and forth,

singing their troubled marriage ballads,

their day-care, car-park, landlord songs.

Even their anger with one another

is lovely; the color rising in their throats,

their white fists clenched in their laps,

the quiet between them that follows.

And their sadness--how deep and full of love

is their sadness when one among them

is hurt, and they hear her calling

and gather about her to cry.

--From "Weather Central" by Ted Kooser (University of Pittsburgh Press,
1994)

Know what you mean, about cigs and smoke and headaches. My husband & I don't
spend much time together, but when we do, everything's great love and poetry
and drinking, but afterwards and hours of conversation and coffee, the cig
smoke is nauseating, makes ME cough but not him. Stinkin permeation-not perfume.
I'll take campfire smoke anyday, poetry around the campfire in spring, summer &
fall oh yeah. But ach, it's winter again.

There's a saying about native blood, that you're only native if you live
native. Well some of you folk are native poets, live a life of poetry, write,
share and have a company of pome friends. It's interesting, the mutual support and
such. Now for literate friends all I have is this cyberia and Poetics, no
money to buy your cool stuff (thanks, Vernon, Steve), no connections for paper
publishing and readings, just my little village, library and computer - but oh
so thankful for it all. Rooted in my reality but enjoying others. Enjoy your
leftovers today, Mary

Right. That's why I call writing poetry a consumpstion, more, an obsessive=20
consumption, like gambling, gin drinking, etc. By its oconomic position, wri=
ting=20
poetry has a counter productive nature to it. That is the essence, I believe=

of its subversive potential. It turns poetry from a "productiom" into a=20
process. I discuss all this in my essay "Is Poetry a Job, Is a Poem a Produc=

No, the poet is paying for it. That's why he/she is a consumer, unproductive=

consumer of time.

The poet. I believe the poet must face, basically accept that. Not doing it=20
leads to illusions.

But, to see the poet as a consumer leads to a clarity of thinking. In "Eda:=20
an Anthology" I thank my own business, Murat Oriental Rugs, Inc., for all th=

financial sacrifices it had to make in the writing of the book. Lead it almo=

Bill,

I do think this is a problem.  None of the poets on the list of fellowships are familiar to me at all and I read a bit and look in at the comprehensive selectives in bookstores in Seattle fairly regularly.

I have two points to add:  just how certain are we that the most innovative workers in dance, music, painting are supported by the NEA?  I've read this argument in Silliman but are we mistaking a more curatorial and connoiseur-driven market, where novelty and duration/quality is rewarded for who actually gets the grant from the NEA?  in this case, Murat is exactly right in saying poetry needs no capital.  my own tendency would be to support the arts which require almost nightmarish amounts of training and not something that one can learn in library and cafes.  We shouldn't assume that our underfunded (less than the Army band, mind you) arts agency could support this activity.

The second is its politics.  And not in a way usually understood on this list.  When an interest group is extremely fragmented, even though from outside it looks like a shared activity, the tendency is for it going no support from the government.  Politicians and, even more so, civil servants, don't like to choose sides when they will only get grief from all other comers.  Thus, the money goes to the lowest common denomination, or in this case, the relatively obscure.  I doubt anyone could create a movement or tendency out of the winners of the 2003 fellowships.

Personally, I think money like NEA grants and the McCarthur fellows should not go to people employed to teach what they write (so poets adjuncting on composition can be funded),  It's matter of them haves getting.  For that matter executives should be getting funding either.  If you have golden parachute and want to write, go ahead, jump.  Perhaps those who got funded by the NEA do fit this requirement.

please pardon my naivete, since i am a reader and not a writer.

Robert

Because all "the opther arts" to one extent or another involve money whereas

poetry is the only medium wherte that connection is zero. Therefere, the idea

of a monetary award is a meaningless concept, as the awards or reviews in The

News York times indicate.

Murat >>

Murat (and anyone else reading this),

If you look way back through the Poetics archives, you'll find I once argued
likewise. We agree as far as this goes. However, I think something more is
in play. Neither music (serious music) nor dance is self-supporting. Both are
developed primarily within the academic arena, and depend on government
grants. Yet the demand for innovative performances is there, and awards are given
to those who meet the demand. Not so with poetry, it seems.

Something is profoundly amiss with those who own the means of poetry
production. Our best critics continue to privilege poetry that is in some way
progressive. Yet most publishers (and NYT reviewers) emphasize the derivative. It's
not as if this old fogey art sells better than the more sophisticated, up to
date product. I doubt that the sort of thing represented by most of the NEA
winners is outselling Charles Bernstein, or Allen Ginsberg, or Frank O'Hara, or
Ezra Pound, or John Ashbery (another exception that proves the rule). For
some reason, a lot of poets just aren't connected to a language/tone appropriate
to their times, and they're being rewarded for it. It's embarrassing.

Look, the $20,000 is important, sure. It permits artists to take some time
off from whatever work they do and focus on their art. That's a good thing.
But it should be reserved for those poets who are pushing the art form forward,
not running in place, especially if the place is the distant past.

But it isn't just about the money. The NEA boasts that an award confers
prestige. If this is true, then the NEA is deliberately headlining old news. This
is very bad for the art form, not to mention the reputation of the agency. I
can't think of a better strategy for killing poetry.

If we can expect more of the same in the future, then I must agree with those
who argue that the NEA should be dismantled, at least that part of it that
awards grants to individual writers. Right now they're doing much more harm
than good.

Best, Bill

The following appeared in the Columbus Dispatch on 11/16/04 written by
Joe Blundo, a Dispatch columnist.


Canada busy sending back Bush-dodgers

The flood of American liberals sneaking across the border into Canada
has intensified in the past week, sparking calls for increased patrols
to stop the illegal immigration.

The re-election of President Bush is prompting the exodus among
left-leaning citizens who fear they'll soon be
required to hunt, pray and agree with Bill O'Reilly.

Canadian border farmers say it's not uncommon to see dozens of
sociology professors, animal-rights activists and Unitarians crossing
their fields at night.

"I went out to milk the cows the other day, and there was a Hollywood
producer huddled in the barn," said Manitoba farmer Red Greenfield,
whose acreage borders North Dakota.

The producer was cold, exhausted and hungry.

"He asked me if I could spare a latte and some free-range chicken.
When I said I didn't have any, he left. Didn't even get a chance to show
him my screenplay, eh?"

In an effort to stop the illegal aliens, Greenfield erected higher
fences, but the liberals scaled them. So he tried installing speakers
that blare Rush Limbaugh across the fields.

"Not real effective," he said. "The liberals still got through, and
Rush annoyed the cows so much they wouldn't give milk."

Officials are particularly concerned about smugglers who meet liberals
near the Canadian border, pack them into Volvo station wagons, drive
them across the border and leave them to fend for themselves.

"A lot of these people are not prepared for rugged conditions," an
Ontario border patrolman said. "I found one carload without a drop of
drinking water. They did have a nice little Napa Valley cabernet,
though."

When liberals are caught, they're sent back across the border, often
wailing loudly that they fear retribution from conservatives. Rumors
have been circulating about the Bush administration establishing
re-education camps in which liberals will be forced to drink domestic
beer and watch NASCAR.

In the days since the election, liberals have turned to
sometimes-ingenious ways of crossing the border.
Some have taken to posing as senior citizens on bus trips to buy cheap
Canadian prescription drugs. After catching a half-dozen young vegans
disguised in powdered wigs, Canadian immigration authorities began
stopping buses and quizzing the supposed senior-citizen passengers.

"If they can't identify the accordion player on The Lawrence Welk
Show, we get suspicious about their age," an official said.

Canadian citizens have complained that the illegal immigrants are
creating and organic-broccoli shortage and renting all the good Susan
Sarandon movies.

"I feel sorry for American liberals, but the  Canadian economy just
can't support them," an Ottawa resident said. "How many art-history
majors does one country need?"

In an effort to ease tensions between the United States and Canada,
Vice President Dick Cheney met with the Canadian ambassador and pledged
that the administration would take steps to reassure liberals, a source
close to Cheney said.

"We're going to have some Peter, Paul & Mary concerts. And we might
put some endangered species on postage stamps. The president is
determined to reach out."

I agree that rap was best in its early years.  But rap/hip hop is not serious
music.  You may make the argument that rap includes serious lyrics.  But the
music is largely derivative, sampled, etc.  I was, at one time, a professional
songwriter and musician so I know a bit about this.  I meant compositional
MUSIC, rather than mere popular songwriting, no matter how political the lyrics
purport to be.  Milton Babbitt, John Cage, Elliot Carter --not Duran Duran, or
Jay Z, or even Bob Dylan.  Mozart, Beethoven, Shubert -- not Robert Burns, or
Woody Guthrie.  Miles Davis, Charlie Parker -- not the Doors or the Jefferson
Airplane.

Compositional music focuses on musical possibilities.  Popular songwriting,
in the main, commingles lyrics (where innovation, if any, usually occurs) with
variations of simple, endlessly repeated ballad, blues, and rhythmic forms.

Better?  By the way, I, of course, thoroughly enjoy popular songs, despite
that the focus is rarely on musical innovation.

Best, Bill

I was able to track down most of the winners, and samples of their work.
They were all employed as Professors at various universities most of which
boasted some prestige.  They are not obscure.  They publish with well known, fairly
conservative presses, and they've been blurbed and reviewed, some by quite
well known poets.

Murat is, of course, correct if is point is that the writing of poetry
requires no capital.  The same is true of fiction.  Of course dancers can always
film their performances on an old camcorder, or simply perform in their garages
for the neighbors.

The dissemination of poetry, like any other art, does require capital.  But
as I've already said, the $20,000 is but one issue, and for me not the more
important one.  What the NEA is supporting, with the rare token exception, is a
kind of cultural necrophelia in the case of poetry.  So much of the stuff is as
bland as death.

Well, I guess I've said all I can about this situation.  I don't expect it to
improve, but let's hope I'm wrong.  As I said at my beginning, I haven't paid
much attention to the awards game in a long, long time.  I checked into the
NEA as a lark.  I had no idea things were this bad.  I should have known
better.  Robert Pinsky and Billy Collins rule the roost, right?

Ron:

I think this speaks to the difference between writing poetry and being a
poet. Executives who use poetry to improve their skills at the office are
like the person who reads "Zen for the Businessman," and thinks this has to
do with the practice of Zen Buddhism. In business lingo, a poet is someone
who is fully invested in the work and tradition of poetics. I've known poets
who committed suicide over the agony of their work and the life it demanded,
like Japanese businessmen used to commit suicide over a business failure.
Serious stuff, indeed. While these golden parachute American poets write
safe little poems, nothing that would endanger their careers or social
position. Wallace Stevens was an anomaly, as genius is wont to be.

I agree with others who have said that separation breeds uniqueness and
that things are more valuable for being rare (choisi = valoir). It
remains for all poets to consider how they have branded themselves by
contributing to what, arguably, is abracadabra trite in service of the
status-quo. Also, my thoughts are to think about how submission to the
NEA or other 'administrators-of-capital' (either monetary or
intellectual) may be a rush to identify with essentialization and
totalization.

Exist out there.

when did you forget you were a flower? when did you look at your skin
and decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive? the ghost of a
locomotive?

You were never no locomotive.

I don't know how some literary critics have been able to bear some of
the things they said. Death of the author? Are you nuts? Talk about
heroic myth-making to strike us dumb! Prolepsis! *Ask yourself: how does
the 'death of the author' correspond to the birth of
administrative-authority over art?* It seems to me sometimes
postmodernism (et seq.) was created solely to produce market-share for
an industry-academy: a grand detour; sound and fury; a stage-show.

(It is entertaining how the academy has extreme difficulty accepting
some guy can survive being nailed-to-a-tree but they have no problem
with nailing 'the author' there and having him walk away scot-free to
write all kinds of 'New' stuff.)

How much did a typical poetry workshop cost pre-postmodernism? How many
poets had their MFA? Where was the NEA? Forgive me if I am expressing my
emotions in an intellectual manner here, but, just like the JFK
assassination, we must look at who gains/benefits from the 'death of
this author' and what has changed.

Today, most artists live by proxy. Every contest and award they win
exchanges their freedom for a lifetime of dependency (rubber dollar
bills). In my experience, the better poets in this world have chosen not
to win a thing.

Dear All:

Hi !
If you are in New York City October 16-December 22 you have an opportunity to see three films by Alfred Leslie at the Allan Stone Gallery located at 113 East 90th Street between lex ave and park ave tel 1 212 987-4997 web www.allanstonegallery.com.

The films are:
"Pull My Daisy" 29 minutes directed by Leslie and Robert Frank featuring Beat poets Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso with narration by Jack Kerouac.

"The Last Clean Shirt" 44 minutes a road movie (second avenue) with dialogue by writer/poet Frank O'Hara

"The Cedar Bar" 84 minutes

Gallery hours are Tuesday thru Friday 10-6 Saturday 10-5

I believe the screenings begin at 2pm. Best to call first.

A great way to see Alfred Leslie's artwork as well as these films. The movie theater is set up in a carriage house/ townhouse thru the gallery and the garden.

I thought this worth passing along !

Nathaniel

Hip Hop music is still getting better, still changing. Take a nice bite of
Outkast, for one example. And while you may think it's funny to hear that
Jay-Z is big pimpin' up in NYC, I don't know if it's fading. Keep fighting
it. I don't think we mind. It's certainly a record of these times we live
in, if anything. How many of you poets are doing that? Is it important? I
don't know.

It's not serious? It is lyrically driven and, in that regard, at least,
inventive. I don=B9t know if I've heard rhymes as creative in any modern
poetry up in this piece, and that's a big shout-out to tradition.

Largely derivative? What isn't? I've used this word, myself, to describe
things, like poems, for example, and all of a sudden I dislike it. Yes, hip
hop samples other recordings, but these artists are sampling from the
spectrum of music and spoken language. It has crossed cultures without the
need for a translator. It is highly compositional. They are making somethin=
g
new. The music is a backdrop for their words and they inform each other.
It's a historical document. It's referential and it's not afraid to show
folks where it comes from. Are you trying to hide those things in your own
work?

Perhaps I went off on a tangent here, but there you have it. Get your freak
on.

To be fair, throughout this discussion I continued to search out work by the
2003 winners.  Last night I found a few samples from one southern poet who
does, at least, fiddle with syntax in some of his poems, and in doing so creates
something like a "voice" (other than that persistent academic drone).  The
tone of these poems is a bit edgy, thankfully low on the syrup meter.  If these
or similar poems appeared in the poet's NEA manuscript, then the situation has
improved slightly.  Only slightly (given so many of the other winners), but
I'll take it.

Best, Bill

Bill,

I think this is an awfully high-handeded dismissal of rap and popular song in general, as not "Serious." Geez, to dismiss Robert Burns is beyond high-handed, but I will let that pass. To me, the implicit assumption here makes the mistake that innovation rests solely in technique, i.e. that it is a matter of technology.  I think the idea of progress is inextricable with the idea of technology, but that technology, in the last instance, does not determine what lasts, which is art (something to memory than a thing).

"Innovation" is a rhetoric, not a fact.  Take the air conditioner.  (Hear me out.)  It's not an innocent example because early in my career of reading the Nation, Hitchens explained that his politics admitted air conditioning was progress.  I am not so sure.  I am absolutely sure, in any case, it doesn't represent Progress in a metaphysical sense.  It's merely one more adaptation in the human struggle with heat.  Some of the old ways make more sense, especially when you figure in external costs.  I could say the same about how the digital world has changed poetry.  It certainly has enabled some new practices, but grammar remains, among other things.  The application of technique to art is not fundamentally different than the application of technology to our lives.  How different, really, is the swath of shops in the Village from a market in Palestine?  Is a car really a quantum leap from a horse?

I am not a devotee of rap or hip-hop, though I listen to it more often than Bach, but in its own way it has a certain complexity.  That thing often labeled as derivativeness is its "textuality."  At a certain point, I realized the sharp divide I had set up between "indie" music and "rap," around the point of originality, didn't really exist.  The musicians were refunctioning old riffs and old sounds, which wasn't so much different than hip-hop's more obvious form of sampling.  Obviously, technical virtuosity on an instrument or in a physical activity takes time and money, and the support of group activities takes more.  But it is not obvious to me that this necessarily corresponds with "progress" in an art.  You solve certain problems and others emerge.   Marsalis, to my understanding, is a virtuoso trumpeter, but I don't know that he has done Dylan has in making changes that change us.  The same goes for free jazz, which often simply astonishes me, but which I truly think yo
 u have
 to be a practitioner to know what is going on.  A development in art that doesn't create an audience for its reception may be progress in some sense, but I would say that was largely technical and largely something for a coterie.  Art is something else.

In any case, I don't think there is terribly much institutional or government support for popular song, let alone hip hop.  Those who practice or admire "serious" music (which I take requires orchestras, etc) should spend more time advocating and creating an audience for their practice and not malign those that are more self-sustaining.  Besides if Stephen Foster is a great composer, than Guthrie and Dylan are as well, and will live certainly as long as the country is here, as should Sondheim (is he a great composer, Bill?  I didn't figure out the criteria, but then I would take the work of Burns over Mozart any day.).

BTW, this line of thinking comes from all the BS that has thrown around about them hating our freedom.  And asking myself, what is our freedom?  Is Hitchens, the great apostasist (his predecessors are really the anti-jacobin writers, some of whom turned on friends in the English reform movement when their war on freedom, the so-called Napoleonic wars began, where Bonaparte became an evil bogey to scare the children with and if you are paranoid, create the utter hell that was the Victorian age (I did say paranoid)), right when he says it is, well, air conditioning?

of course, above all, art should supported by the gov't and other bodies.  it's because what remains.  but I did say something about fractious interest groups.


thanks,
Robert

I agree that rap was best in its early years. But rap/hip hop is not serious
music. You may make the argument that rap includes serious lyrics. But the
music is largely derivative, sampled, etc. I was, at one time, a professional
songwriter and musician so I know a bit about this. I meant compositional
MUSIC, rather than mere popular songwriting, no matter how political the lyrics
purport to be. Milton Babbitt, John Cage, Elliot Carter --not Duran Duran, or
Jay Z, or even Bob Dylan. Mozart, Beethoven, Shubert -- not Robert Burns, or
Woody Guthrie. Miles Davis, Charlie Parker -- not the Doors or the Jefferson
Airplane.

Compositional music focuses on musical possibilities. Popular songwriting,
in the main, commingles lyrics (where innovation, if any, usually occurs) with
variations of simple, endlessly repeated ballad, blues, and rhythmic forms.

Better? By the way, I, of course, thoroughly enjoy popular songs, despite
that the focus is rarely on musical innovation.

Best, Bill

presents

Poet Lisa Cooper
Visual Artist George Welch
Sunday, December 5, 7 pm
WILDE PLAYHOUSE, 135 E. Congress Street, Tucson
Admission: $5; Students $3

Lisa Cooper grew up in Tucson, eventually earning an MFA in creative writing
from the University of Arizona in 1989. Chax Press published her full-length
collection of poems, & Calling It Home, in 1998, and she won an Arizona
Commission on the Arts fellowship in 2001. Other poems have been published
in numerous literary magazines, including New American Writing, Talisman,
Sonora Review, Hambone, Spork, and others. Her interests include music,
visual art, local history and culture, and the politics of the U.S./Mexico
border. She claims that she has now lived in Tucson for so long that summer
has become her favorite time of year. She works as a book editor for Rio
Nuevo Publishers.


George Welch began in the Bronx but has been in Tucson for more than two
decades, and was one of the original artists teaching when Pima College's
West Campus broke ground. With a master's degree from Bank Street College in
New York, Welch has been painting for 34 years. He is a color field lyrical
abstractionist, and his concerns are chaos, order, yin-yang, and
reconciliation, i.e. with the entire ground of the spiritual in art.
Recently he has been working with illuminants in his exploration of
spiritual and intellectual enlightenment.

POG events are sponsored in part by grants from the Tucson/Pima Arts
Council, the Arizona Commission on the Arts, and the National Endowment for
the Arts. POG also benefits from the continuing support of The University of
Arizona Poetry Center, the Arizona Quarterly, Chax Press, and The University
of Arizona Department of English.

<< I think this is an awfully high-handeded dismissal of rap and popular song

Robert,

I see your point, but it's not entirely relevant to mine.  I used the term
"serious" because many musicians (when I was in the biz) preferred it to
"Classical," a term more familiar to most people, but a misnomer.  I've already
exchanged "serious" for "compositional" (in my reply to Murat), though I don't know
that the latter term is much better.  My examples, however, should do the
job.  Those and similar examples live on government funding, one way or another,
and always have.  Popular song is, well, popular precisely because, in the
main, it is far less complex and, yes, innovative, musically.  I don't think I
dismissed popular song.  I merely stated the factual.  Most of my students,
generally ages 18 - 21, think that popular song hasn't advanced much since the
1960s.  (They're pretty sophisticated on that score.)  There are exceptions, of
course.  That goes without saying.  There are always exceptions that prove the
rule.

I also made clear that I like popular song, at least some of it.  Unlike you,
I happen to be a big fan of rap, particularly the early work.  Unfortunately,
In the twenty or so years since rap made its appearance, the form has become
derivative and v e r y commercialized.  Still, some rap LYRICS are represented
in prestigious anthologies of literature, and they should be.

Sorry about Robert Burns.  But he WAS a craftman of popular ballad form.
Again, I don't think this is dismissive, or at least not a "high handed"
dismissal.  I'm just pointing out the obvious, that Burns was no Beethoven.  And
again, to support my earlier point, it's the lyrics we have canonized, not the
music.

If I say that Bob Dylan is an artist, while Britany Spears is merely an
entertainer, am I being dismissive?  So be it.  As for your impression that I come
off somewhat elitist -- well, sometimes that's unavoidable.  One often cannot
make judgments without bearing that accusation.  In my own defense, I have
repeatedly acknowledged in previous posts, on a number of issues, that I could be
wrong.  I don't think so in this case, but I could be wrong.  That's the best
I can do.

Regarding your comments on innovation:  you ask if a car is really a quantum
leap from a horse.  My answer is YES.  Technique isn't the whole ball of wax
(I've argued as much in the past), but it does matter -- a lot.  Certainly when
we discuss the evolution of any art form, we focus on how something is
conveyed as much as what is conveyed.  "The Waste Land" could have said what it said
in conventional stanzas, without the fragmentation, but then it wouldn't be
"The Waste Land," nor would it have had the influence it had, marking as it did
a break between Modernism and the past.  The same can be said for any number
of Modernist writers.  Even as far back as Walt Whitman (and further back),
technique looms large in the legend.

By the way, my apologies for casting some words in CAPS.  I'm not shouting.
It's just that my underlining and/or italics do not come through on the list.
Don't know what else to do for emphasis.

Thanks for the give and take, Robert.  I enjoyed it.

Best, Bill

Bill,

The other day you asked how many "serious" musicians received NEA grants.
The NEA has given grants to jazz musicians, some of whom take their
composing seriously. I'm not sure precisely what these jazz artists received
their NEA grants for, but here's a short and quick list:

Leroy Jenkins
George Lewis
Wadada Leo Smith (I think)
Thomas Chapin
Sheila Jordan

Jenkins, Lewis and Smith were affiliated with the AACM in Chicago early in
their careers. Chapin was involved in the Downtown Music scene, e.g. playing
at the old Knitting Factory. In any case, the jazz vanguard got some
institutional support.

Sheila Jordan has been around forever, it seems, but not in what I'd
consider the avant-garde..

As far as Rap, I don't listen to it often but I've heard a wide range of
quality. Rapping itself is a style that goes back a number of decades. The
musical underpinnings used in the 1970s turned it into a musical idiom. (At
this point I'll defer to those more knowledgeable about the subject.) When
I've heard rappers interviewed on radio, they sound every bit as serious
about their work as a jazz musician or poet.

Best,

Vernon

Poetry, apart from cave painting, is the oldest artform known to people. I
believe that one can be a poet and exist within many lifestyles and jobs,
being a poet is kind of like a secular/poetic version of Augustine's City of
God it is a mystical body of people whose view the world a certain way and
express the situation with language as their medium. this body is not visual
it is spiritual and artistic, this is why I reject for example the
contrivance that I am not really a poet but a 'writer' no I am a poet. Poets
can exist in many places, Monasteries, Corporate Boardrooms, Universities,
Factories all are poets I utterly reject one lifestyle for poets.

I wouldn't be so quick to slam the businessmen poets, although I understand
the reasoning very well. I have my own criteria for determining who's a
serious writer of poetry or fiction and who isn't. It's like measuring
"heart" in a boxer. The ones I take most seriously have the determination of
Joe Frazier wanting to go out for the 15th round in Ali-Frazier III.

What's wrong with working to sustain yourself? Even starving artists have to
find a way to eat and keep a roof over their heads. I hated my job, but it
paid my bills and gave me the money to self-publish work that other
publishers were afraid to touch. (I also learned how to write on the job,
turning my bureaucrat's post into an unofficial government grant.) A lot of
deeply-committed poets work at jobs they hate because they'll die if they
don't. Does anybody know of any poets who write posthumously?

Still, the businessman writing poetry smacks of dilettantism, or at least
seems to hint at it. But again, you have to consider the individual, first.
I'm sure there are plenty of people who take their writing very seriously
while maintaining careers, and that there are many others who write
complacent middlebrow poetry that would make us snicker---or snarl when we
found out how much money they were making compared to us.

I'm just looking through the accumulation of the last week or two of
the poetics list and the continuing discussion about NEA fellowships.
I've worked on selection panels for many different granting agencies,
public and private over the last 20 years, virtually all for grants
related to artists and/or organizations involved in performing arts,
particularly new music. I know about how NEA grants are administered
generally, though I certainly don't know ANY details about any
particular round of NEA writing fellowships.

I also am not saying that I think this is a flawless program. There
are many things wrong with how this system works, but nearly all of
these problematic issues have not previously been addressed on this
list because, apparently, few of the people posting on this issue
have known how the system works. While a few people who've written in
on this topic do seem to have some sense of what's going on with the
program, so much of the accumulated dialog is so completely
misinformed and shows such a high degree of ignorance of the
processes involved, that it's difficult to know where to start in
addressing the combined discussion of the last week or so. The short
answer is basically: there's no reason to believe that some external
agency is going to do what you want it to & you're not going to
change it without knowing why it does what it already does.

Reading the analyses of the list of fellowship recipients, as well as
the suggestions of individuals who should have been getting these
funds, raises a usually unexamined corollary to some of the ongoing
discussion: that this community of more than 1,000 e-mail readers
each hold differing opinions about what writers might be "innovative"
poets worthy of support.

Looking back on the forty years or so the agency has operated, the
NEA has NEVER made "innovation" in the arts a major priority for
support, either for organizations or individuals. Whatever
organizations or individual artists who received support from the NEA
in the past who work in any of the various "innovative" traditions of
art received the support based on other criteria entirely. The NEA
generally rewards quality and stability, judging both by entirely
subjective means based on information and materials submitted with
application forms.

More importantly: NEA fellowships are selected ENTIRELY from whatever
pool of writers who have chosen to apply for NEA fellowships in a
particular year. If a writer has NOT applied for a writing
fellowship, no matter how worthy for a grant they may be, that writer
can NOT and will NOT receive a fellowship. There is NO mysterious
jury picking writers they want to support based on what panel members
may have read in various publications. They look only at writers who
have applied for support.

I expect that a very, VERY HIGH proportion of the writers that
various posters to this list think should have received NEA writing
fellowships in recent years did not apply. Most people don't. In the
past when there were NEA fellowship programs for artists working in
many forms, and not just writing at best about 1 out of 20-25
applicants were awarded fellowships. Because of recent budget
considerations, it is very likely that the odds are now substantially
higher and I would not be surprised if only one out of forty or fifty
applicants were now awarded fellowships. There are a lot of writers
and there's not a lot of money. Looking at the range of poetry
available in a specialty store like, say, Open Books in Seattle or
Grolier in Boston, I'd guess that the proportion of "innovative"
poets to poets working in other styles is probably 1 out of ten or
twenty. To expect a program that is not set up to reward "innovation"
to provide fellowships for "innovative" writers in a significantly
greater proportion than this is simply not realistic. If the NEA gets
something like 4-500 applications, and gives out 20-30 fellowships
for there to be more than 1-2 "innovative writers AT THE MOST who
receive support in any given grant cycle is very very unlikely.

Applicants for NEA writing fellowships fill out a fairly simple form
and submit what they consider to be representative work samples. The
work samples are submitted without indication of who wrote them.
There are many things wrong with any system of blind submissions of
work samples. (People always cite instances in which the jury MUST
have known who supposedly "blind" applicants were and that has been
an actual problem in some cases. But I also know of more than one
instance in which a composer was cut during the first round of
consideration because jurors thought that the work samples submitted
were derivative of that very composer's work - in this case, the
staff of the granting organization brought the application forward
for re-consideration during subsequent non-blind stages of the
process because they weren't idiots.) All other grant and fellowship
programs are not judged blind. If blind judging is a problem for an
applicant for any reason, it makes sense to NOT apply for support
from agencies that use it in their adjudication process.

Members of the NEA panel (and, just as recipients are drawn from the
pool of applicants, it's possible for anyone: writer, critic, reader,
whatever; to submit a resume and ask to be considered as a panelist
for any NEA grant category) read the unidentified work samples,
ideally before meeting collectively, and make their own opinions
about the relative value of the works. When the panel meets, they
discuss these opinions and collectively rank them in some sort of
relative order. At some point during the process, the staff will
inform them of the amount of funds available for fellowships and they
make a tentative cut-off point on this ranked list. Members of these
panels rotate off after 2-3 years in a staggered schedule so that
each subsequent panel is not literally made up of the same jurors.

Let me also note here that many many artists working in all fields
and genres often have little or no understanding of how people
respond to their work or what it is that they respond positively to.
One of the most frustrating things about serving on grant review
panels is that so many work samples by artists are so crappy that NO
amount of discussion by a juror who knows and wants to support the
work can sway other jurors who haven't experienced other examples of
what they artists does. There are only so many ways that you can say
something like "no, really, this artist is a lot better than what
they've submitted for our consideration."

It is also likely that there is also some kind of consideration about
the geographic spread of the potential recipients of these
fellowships. Just as legislators are generally more supportive of
funding bills which include some money that goes to their own state
or congressional district, legislators are concerned about tax-based
programs that do not support artists from an array of locations
around the United States. I do not know for sure, and this kind of
consideration may NOT made by the jury itself, but it's possible that
some adjustments are made to the recipient list so that some of the
funding goes to writers who do not live in either New York State or
California where, for better or for worse, a very large proportion of
artists in the US live.

Now, about all the discussion about the relative level of support for
the non-literary arts in the United States and how this may have
influenced the development of the arts in the US. There are currently
absolutely NO NEA fellowship programs for painters, sculptors,
composers, choreographers, dramatists, film makers, or any creative
artists other than writers. ONLY writers can apply for fellowships
from the NEA. This has been true for about ten years now, and is very
very unlikely to change any time soon.

When the NEA did have fellowships in dance, music, visual arts, etc,
the proportion of "innovative" recipients relative to the number of
recipients working in, what, more staid forms (using the term
"traditional" as a distinction from something like "innovative" in
regard to the NEA is problematic because they have a program that
supports REALLY traditional folk arts like banjo pickers, Hmong
tapestry makers, etc) was not significantly different from that of
the proportion of "innovative" writers among fellowship recipients.

(There are currently two small award programs for which jazz
performers or folk/traditional artists who have had lengthy careers
[usually something like 40-50 years] can be nominated. They can't
literally apply and, in most cases the nominations are made by staff
members of organizations who present jazz or folk artists. There have
usually been only one or two awards in a given year to jazz masters
[though in the last round they gave out 4-6]. In the folk arts
category, there are something like 6-10 awards a year [but this
covers all traditional genres, including music, dance, crafts, etc].
These "master" artist awards are selected by peer panels which are,
for reasons that should be obvious, are NOT working with blind
submissions.

When you consider that fellowships do nothing more than buy some time
for creative artists to make work and in the performing arts when the
composition process is complete there's still no art work to look at
without rehearsals, and performances that cost far more than any
fellowship can support, the comparative support from the NEA for
individual creative artists has always been somewhat skewed IN FAVOR
of artists like writers. When a poet or novelist completes a
manuscript, the work is done.  Sure writers still need to find
publishers, but they have something that anyone who can read can see
in something very close to its finished form. This is quite literally
not the case for a composer, choreographer, playwright, etc. When
they have a score or script completed, they have nothing that they
can hand to someone outside of their field that can be experienced as
a fully realized artform.

Does any of this mean that if more "innovative" writers were to apply
for NEA fellowships there would necessarily be more innovative
writers who received support? No, though it'd probably make some kind
of difference if more people who were supportive of innovative
writing submitted resumes to be considered as NEA panelists.

Does any of this mean that any particular "innovative" writer who
applies for NEA fellowships regularly will eventually receive one? No.

Are writers worse off than other creative artists in terms of how
they are supported by the NEA? Actually, no.

Does the NEA reward "innovation" in any of the art forms it supports? No.

Is this system perfect? No. Can it be made better? Sure.

If you want to do something to try to make the NEA writers fellowship
program better, you've got to know how the agency really works and
you've got to know how to work with, within, and against bureaucratic
structures. Whining on the poetics list about what you wish would
happen instead of what does happen isn't going to change anything.

&, because of changes in the NEA's mission and operations after the
various attempts at shutting down the agency in the 1980s, many of
the changes people have mentioned could only be realized through
limitations added the federal legislation that authorizes the agency.
How many of y'all really think it would be worth spending the time
necessary to lobby Congress for the possibility of barely increasing
the number of "innovative" poets who get $20K from a tiny government
agency once every two years?

If you're leaning toward saying that you do indeed think this would
be time well spent, let me suggest you first think about all of the
other issues you might also want the US legislature to consider and
act on in the coming years. A few $20K fellowships are damn
unimportant in the overall scheme of what the current administration
does and does not seem likely to attempt in the next four years.

But hey, maybe that's just me.

Raymond:

I think that you're getting something mixed up here, something that I
touched on before. Writing poetry and being a poet can be different, just
like painting and being a painter can be different. It's how much of your
life you have invested in it, how much you're willing to sacrifice to your
muse. It's the difference between an affair and a committed relationship.
It's fine for people to write poetry when they have some time, but being a
poet is staking your life on your gift. While it's true that "poets can
exist in many places," they are not easily accepted in many places, because
they are perceived as being "different" and having "strange ideas." I'm an
ex-executive, so I know this from experience. How you make your living has a
lot to do with how you live, thus who you are. Right livelihood is a primary
Buddhist ethic for good reason.

Subject: various NEA threads

I'm just looking through the accumulation of the last week or two of
the poetics list and the continuing discussion about NEA fellowships.
I've worked on selection panels for many different granting agencies,
public and private over the last 20 years, virtually all for grants
related to artists and/or organizations involved in performing arts,
particularly new music. I know about how NEA grants are administered
generally, though I certainly don't know ANY details about any
particular round of NEA writing fellowships.

I also am not saying that I think this is a flawless program. There
are many things wrong with how this system works, but nearly all of
these problematic issues have not previously been addressed on this
list because, apparently, few of the people posting on this issue
have known how the system works. While a few people who've written in
on this topic do seem to have some sense of what's going on with the
program, so much of the accumulated dialog is so completely
misinformed and shows such a high degree of ignorance of the
processes involved, that it's difficult to know where to start in
addressing the combined discussion of the last week or so. The short
answer is basically: there's no reason to believe that some external
agency is going to do what you want it to & you're not going to
change it without knowing why it does what it already does.

Reading the analyses of the list of fellowship recipients, as well as
the suggestions of individuals who should have been getting these

discussion: that this community of more than 1,000 e-mail readers
each hold differing opinions about what writers might be "innovative"

Dalachinsky laughs when we differentiate art from living. Artists simply
express themselves, and their authenticity isn't determined by a percentage. Since
when does quantity of creations or financial suffering/prosperity define an
artist? Try raising a bunch of kids, let alone keep yourself alive and still
survive to have enough brain left at the end of the day, enough to create
anything. Ask di Prima, ask Creeley, different paths, but ask anyone whose loved
ones and life itself are their muse. It's easy to be an artiste or a christ or a
buddha if you don't have dependents. Like Vernon just said, you can't write
posthumously.You slave until you can't take the bullshit any longer, then you
break down, barely alive, and write a whole bunch until you have to go back and
put on the chains again. It's very difficult to find the sane daily balance of
sainthood and selfishness. Mary

to be precise, my rejection letter from the nea this year indicates
1600 applications, with 45 fellowships awarded...

i like herb's post---a lot... i *would* like to make the entirely
friendly observation, ALL of that taken into account, that this
doesn't change the basic argument that bill was making:  i.e., that
the nea continues to award $20K fellowships to thems that oughtn't to
get such things...

says who?... says me!... and i say this w/o meaning to make any
argument at all re innovation... i've heard such claptrap drop from
the lips of nea-laureled poets (and a large number of nea-laureled
poets) that i've had to wonder, seriously now, who on god's green
judging panel actually thought that stuff was worth a $20K
incentive...

that the problem is systemic (setting aside specific cases---which
many of us could probably cite---where it's been all but certain that
a judge knew the work of his/her student colleague etc.) should
probably encourage us to seek systemic solutions... i.e., that
haven't specifically to do with writing, or even with the nea...

i'm committed, for one, to submitting my work every two years, no

Joe,

Of course it's an insider game...I thought that was implicit in Herb's comments...One Example Among Thousands: When I first moved to Ohio I was invited to judge the best magazine. innocently looking for fresh (yes, innovative!) ideas and formats, i bypassed staples like The Ohio Review, Journal, Kenyon Review, etc. and chose John Byrum's The Difficulties...I was never asked back...And during my tenure on the state arts council I saw judges voting for their friends and, when their friends got on, voting for ex-judges...Not once did my choices make the cut..That's why, thoughj, it isn't so much conspiratorial as ideological. I;m sure the judges and winners really believe they are picking the "best" stuff...

Vernon & Bill,
what are you guys doing, giving yourself pats on
the back for being neglected avant-gardists?
The neglected avant-garde poet is a cliche.
The NEA may be a flawed granting organization
but I can name a couple of deserving poets and
friends who got one: Linda Gregg and Doug Anderson.

What I quoted, Steve, didn't say 'in the world', it said 'If ye were
*of* the world' -- vive la diff=E9rance, as Derrida would say.

As it is, I have great difficulty in responding to what only you,
yourself, sees. It would be helpful to me if you became more
self-conscious about words and meanings as they are articulated (not so
'full of yourself' -- as you accuse me of being) before using them as a
jumping-off point.=20

Also, I do understand that your writing style (sp? grammar?) may be
deliberate in so far as you do not want any responses but only
submissions by silence?

[As an aside, it appears to be a motif on po-list to mess up one's
language when making assertions -- to deliberately avoid expressing
one's meaning openly -- not so much as to make what one has said
imperfect, but more like untrustworthy (an unusual defense mechanism). I
do not wish to seem autocratic in my suggestion, but, the effect is that
foundations are too scanty for building upon (and are arguably unsound).
If we are to have meaningful discussion we might chose to remedy these
misdirections. In other words, it makes sense to me to defer prejudices
against discussion as much as possible on a discussion-list. This plea
may come too late, I know, for many it seems have cemented themselves in
dispositions which will not suffer contradiction, but will defend
obstinately to the end whatever they have adopted in the name of
postmodernism et seq. (the pervasive status-quo). Even so, I will make
the attempt, and spare no effort, for there is no positive reason to
abandon the expectation of achievement.]

Eight deer on the slope
in the summer morning mist.
The night sky blue.
Me like a mare let out to pasture.
The Tao does not console me.
I was given the way

Breathing it waking and sleeping.
But now there is no amazing smell
of sperm on my thighs,
no spreading it on my stomach
to show pleasure.
I will never give up longing.
I will let my hair stay long.
The rain proclaims these trees,
the trees tell of the sun.
Let birds, let birds.
Le leaf be passion.
Let jaw, let teeth, let tongue be
between us. Let joy.
Let entering. Let rage and calm join.
Let quail come.
Let winter impress you. Let spring.
Allow the lost ocean to wake in you.
Let the mare in the field
in the summer morning mist
make you whinny. May you come
to the fence and whinny. Let birds.

How about a con man? Or a bank robber? A hired killer? There are choices as
to how you make your living, how you live your life, and this effects what
you write, and what you have to say. The work of someone who lives on the
street, or someone who came home from a war, will be different than someone
who works in a bank, and, with some exceptions, will probably speak from a
more authentic place. I'm assuming, of course, that they all have talent. If
you don't have different experiences than that of others, something unique
to say, why write? Or, why should I take the time to read what you've
written?

I've heard Bill's argument before, from composers of New Music.  But he has
a point.  There's a serious and often puzzling gap between innovative
writers and innovative composers - gaps bridged occasionally by people like
John Cage or Alaric Sumner.  But on the whole, awareness of contemporary
composers by innovative writers - and the reverse - is alarmingly small;
composers when setting texts often pick surprisingly conservative writers,
and writers are often only aware of various popular musics, and not at all
aware of the interesting work going on in New Music.   Taking Sondheim as an
example of an innovative composer illustrates the point - what about
Xenakis, Barrett, Andriessen, a thousand others?  Why aren't they part of
the discourse?  Innovation, in the work of composers like these, is about a
lot more than technique; as it is, indeed, in poetry.

I'm not, btw, dissing popular music in saying this.  Nor, in my experience,
do composers get all snobby about popular music - it is often a force (with
other forces) behind their work.  And I'm also perfectly aware that there
are people, like Bill, who know what's going on.  But as a general
observation, it seems to be the case.

"Outsider" poets for the Carrboro Poetry Festival

The 2004 Carrboro Poetry Festival was a success beyond any anticipation, and so I am charged with the mission of organizing the 2005 Festival, to be held May 21 and 22 in downtown Carrboro, North Carolina.  The coming festival should ideally be of the same scale and feel--what I am aimimg to improve upon is our ability to subsidize travel and accomodations for out-of-town readers.  I am also working on developing the festival with respect to its independent status: the festival has no formal ties to any business or university--it is rooted in progressive community government.

Brian Blanchfield, Brian Henry, Carl Martin, Chris Murray, Daniel Wideman, Gerald Barrax, Joseph Donahue, Hassen, Jaki Shelton Green, K. Silem Mohammad, Lee Ann Brown, Linh Dinh, Murat Nemet-Nejat, Ravi Shankar, and Standard Schaefer were just some of the readers at the 2004 event.  Several accounts of the event as well as a complete audio archive are available at the festival website: http://www.carrboropoetryfestival.org

In order to further the mission of independence, I am looking for writers of spectacular poetry who have operated and continue to operate *outside* the twin pillars of poetry: slam and academia.  While I will feature slam and academic poets at the 2005 festival just as I did with the 2004 fest, I believe there is a sort of middle ground that I would like to be more strongly represented, a middle ground that is hard to identify.  Specifically, I am having a difficult time identifying poets who operate outside of the aforementioned two worlds that seem to dominate poetry.

That a poet has either participated in slams or published in academic-oriented publications does not preclude a poet from consideration.  What I am specifically looking for are names of poets who have *not* received university-level degrees (or are not currently pursuing such degrees) in creative writing/language arts/lit, and who do not teach literature or poetry at the university level.  While it is easy to find such "outsider" poets abroad, I find it increasingly hard to find poets in the US who are not somehow tied to university poetics or the American creative writing industry.

My aim is to represent a diverse poetics at the festival--it is not my intention to exclude academics or slammers.  I wish to represent the poetry of all three groups.

Send names, contact info, and especially poetry.

Best,
Patrick

This is the Blue Collar Fallacy. It is simply not the case that
someone who works in a bank is less human than someone who lives on
the street.

Steve is maybe using poetry as dicssion or discusion as poetry? - I might
get cemented now and then but I am open to changing my views....but others
are maybe stuck -

I know it can be an annoying tactic to "mess up one's language"

But in my case I sometimes start thinking I know what I'm on about then
realising all the contradictions and evern arguing against myself - hence
everyone - myself included gets confused -interesting technique or lack of
method  -  is that what is called "deconstructing" ?

What I quoted, Steve, didn't say 'in the world', it said 'If ye were
*of* the world' -- vive la différance, as Derrida would say.

As it is, I have great difficulty in responding to what only you,
yourself, sees. It would be helpful to me if you became more
self-conscious about words and meanings as they are articulated (not so
'full of yourself' -- as you accuse me of being) before using them as a
jumping-off point.

Also, I do understand that your writing style (sp? grammar?) may be
deliberate in so far as you do not want any responses but only
submissions by silence?

[As an aside, it appears to be a motif on po-list to mess up one's
language when making assertions -- to deliberately avoid expressing
one's meaning openly -- not so much as to make what one has said
imperfect, but more like untrustworthy (an unusual defense mechanism). I
do not wish to seem autocratic in my suggestion, but, the effect is that
foundations are too scanty for building upon (and are arguably unsound).
If we are to have meaningful discussion we might chose to remedy these
misdirections. In other words, it makes sense to me to defer prejudices
against discussion as much as possible on a discussion-list. This plea
may come too late, I know, for many it seems have cemented themselves in
dispositions which will not suffer contradiction, but will defend
obstinately to the end whatever they have adopted in the name of
postmodernism et seq. (the pervasive status-quo). Even so, I will make
the attempt, and spare no effort, for there is no positive reason to
abandon the expectation of achievement.]

Actually, Ron, I think there are 4 Rons. I was just quoting one of them(and
I didn't make it up! )
I still don't how you do the amount that you do. I can only imagine that
when the four of you have your meetings, you must be working with a dynamite
piece of software that keeps each of you on task!

Honestly, your extraordinary exuberance and discipline has always been a
source of personal wonder and hardly an example that many - I suspect - will
ever match. Which I suspect is probably a healthy, relieved state for many
of us relative loafers out here!

Spoons


Cybermind and fiction-of-philosophy, now wryting, began in association
with Spoons, and on the Spoons servers. Malgosia Askanas has been the
major force, I believe, in Spoons - which has brilliantly housed a number
of philosophy lists for years.

The fading of the collective is, I think, incredibly sad, and for me, (I
don't speak for anyone else) reflects not only the growth of the somewhat
protective domains of the blogs, but also the increasing turn to the right
wing in the United States, accompanied by an erosion of discourse. This
erosion isn't only found in enclave-building, acerbic commentary, the
usual disunity, but also in a very real exhaustion: how we can talk, and
talk, and talk...

From: "malgosia askanas" <ma@panix.com>

Dear All,

This is to let you know that in about two weeks I intend to close down the
habermas list.  This decision is part of a wider set of decisions having
to do with the present circumstances of the Spoon Collective - which, as
you probably know, has been running this list.

The Spoon Collective, of which I am the sole surviving founder, has been
operating continually for over 10 years.  Of the 8 people who currently
constitute it, 3 have been in it basically from the very beginning, and
almost all the others for almost as long.

When the Spoon Collective was originally created, a crucial aspect of its
life was our own passionate involvement in the lists we created or took
over.  As vehicles for bringing into mutual contact and confrontation
thinking people from all over the computerized world - people from
astoundingly different walks of life and with astoundingly different ways
of thinking, but with a shared passion for more accurate perception and
deeper understanding - these lists seemed to us to present a stupendous
potential for evolving new modes of thought and new modes of life.  And it
is essential to note that when we were motivated by a thirst for new modes
of thought and life, it was for _ourselves_ that we wanted them.  Our
project was not about providing a public or academic or political service,
discharging a societal duty, or providing platforms for this or that
political organization or orientation - rather, it was about changing life
- the life we think and live - right at the present moment.

Over the years, however, our relationship with our lists gradually
changed, and we now find our collective endeavor basically reduced to an
indifferent performance of a not-excessively-bothersome piece of labor.
The reasons for this are undoubtedly complex - the first and simplest one,
perhaps, being that the same group of people has been doing the same thing
for 10 years.  If our goal had been less the stability of existing lists
and more the preservation of our own passion, we probably could have done
better.  In any case, we find ourselves a bunch of burnt out and apathetic
bureaucrats.

I personally find thie prolongation of this situation no longer tolerable
or sensical.  As a result, I have (1) announced that I am quitting the
Spoon Collective; (2) decided to close down a number of lists that I have
been responsible for; and (3) declared the end of the Spoon Collective as
a certain historic formation, and stipulated that the name no longer be
used for whatever the present members may undertake in the future.

I, of course, cannot judge the value of any particular list from any
perspective but my own - and neither would I want to.  Only each of you
can decide whether you value this list enough to step in and recreate it
somewhere else.  If any of you wants to do this, I can make available to
you a copy of the subscription list, a tarred and gzipped copy of the
archive, and software support for a smooth transition.  The present list
will stop operating around December 10th.

A number of the other members of Spoon have expressed an interest in
either continuing their present lists or initiating other collective
projects at Virginia.  We very much hope that no matter what develops, the
Spoon archives, which, in large part, constitute an eminently useful and
fascinating resource, can continue to be housed in their present location.
In addition, a copy of the archives is being installed at the domain
driftline.org, where they will soon be accessible over the Web.  If
anybody would like to house additional copies of the full or individual
archives elsewhere, this would of course increase the goodness.


Yours,
-malgosia

whatever  just BULLshit it comes in it comes it  like cecil taylor  did
for me when i first heard him at  16 yrs or so  or it grows  as you learn
to listen if that's  possible  you listen to rap more than bach  i pity
you  well not really i pity me more     i guess language poets wre the
only oned who get  language poetry  FART FART    frat   tarf raft art(f)
arf(t)   etc


could you imagine what the state of  art,  especially the stuff out of
the mainstream like  free jazz, abstrascgt expressionism worth
millions,whose audience  sadly is too small,  would be  if it was only
listened to  seen appreciated by their practitioners  that goes for a
great innovator  named bach  as well

wouldn't  you have to be  a practitioner of whatever you do like plumbing
 to  really know what's going on  or poetry bad or good  well not mee

"If it describes what it sees how does it do it. If it describes what it
knows how does it do it and what is the difference between what it sees
and what it knows. And then too there is what it feels and then also
there is what it hopes and wishes and then to there is what it would see
if it could see and then there is what it explains" (Lectures 14).

"Some say it is repression but no it is not repression it is a lack of
connection, of there being no connection with living and daily living
because there is none, that makes American writing what it always has
been and what it will continue to become." (Lectures 53-4).

Last week in one of the international newspapers in English a journalist
wrote (I'm quoting from memory) 'for now the border between East and
West appears to be the Dnieper river'.

"I keep telling the French people that they do not understand twentieth
century war-fare, I get angry I say after all if the Anglo-Americans had
not blown up as they did everything in Germany and in the countries
working for Germany the Russians would be still where they were in the
elbow of the Dnieper" (Wars 164).

Either there's no relationship at all between the reference in last
week's news and Stein's--if referentiality is a problem in that
chronicle, i.e. "it can be anything and if it is it can change to
anything else and after all what difference does it make" (Wars 72)--and
so aligning them merely plays on the coincidence, or, in the attempt to
try to see, however briefly, even in the moment of a single word, like a
place name in Ukraine, any logic in history, if there are processes
operating beneath events and their appearances, so that one might grasp
in the present the threatening idea of an unfinished century and its
unfinished wars:

"This present war is so logical as I understand logic so much more
logical than the 1914-'18 war, that was relatively simple and you had
simple opinions and simple points of view but this war, well there are
so many sides to be on all logical and the events in spite of their
confusion are so logical, not nineteenth century at all not at all. The
nineteenth century was completely lacking in logic, it had cosmic terms
and hopes, and aspirations, and discoveries, and ideals but it had no
logic, and I like logic I really do, I suppose that is the reason that I
so naturally had my part in killing the nineteenth century and killing
it dead, quite like a gangster with a mitraillette, if that is the same
as a tommy gun" (Wars I Have Seen 91).

In the 1934 Narration lectures it's the time of the Old Testament when
people are said to have "felt what they saw" and that might be one
problem linking Stein's chronicle to last week's news, at least for
anyone experiencing in their writing (or other arts) the space
separating visual information from the ability to feel it, whatever that
might mean in a world of false forms. It might mean silence. It might
mean the ability of language to register the blow. It might mean going
into the difference, antithesis, between allegorical and technical
image, for the Marine in the Mosque in Falluja needs to accrue
interpretive density for the information flows to be slowed down. It
might even mean freedom if one freedom can be conceived as confronting
the ethics of the representation, going there and getting that in the
space of its negativity. Does Stein's chronicle explore the minimal
emotional register of the spectator? Writing undergoes perceptual and
cognitive problems which it cannot solve or pretend to solve, unlike so
much discourse.

"...it is a new form of jazz, unconditional surrender..." (Wars 111).
Whose logic would that be anyway to explain passages from Stein's
chronicle rather than view them, play with them even, if on one plane
among many in the space separating literature from history there is this
playfulness (agility, delight, caprice) involving giving in, giving up,
giving over to the aimless visual and auditory signals pounding eye and
ear, the shores of consciousness as if it, or they, or that other, that
double, the mind and its writing, were ever or could ever be thought. "I
personally think that the solution is that one must amuse himself with
anything and not think to recognize anything beside this thing, beside
playing with what he is playing with as he is writing what he is
recognizing while the writing is being written by him" (Narration 58-9).

That would be to give the writing some freedom. What is that? Whatever
the injunction is not. The injunction arrives by force from outside the
writing and turns the writing towards the outside the injunction
determines. If there are 'liberated zones' in Wars I Have Seen, as when
the Bolsheviks are mentioned, drifting up for a moment from the flows of
headlines and radio programs, said by Stein to have "enjoyed" what they
were doing, especially at Brest-Litovsk (Wars 80) ("a war that puts an
end to a century that makes one century change to another century that
kind of war always makes a considerable part of the population get
moving and in a way they enjoy it, the Russians did after the Russian
revolution" (Wars 107).

Wars I Have Seen writes off the talk in the village, on the trains, in
the markets, in the newspapers, on the radio, and memory, as much as it
exists, passes across the outlines of events as accelerated ephemera,
and one might even understand the problem of the proposition that "I was
there to begin to kill what was not dead" (Wars 21) both as caption to
media image of the Marine in the Mosque in Falluja and as counter-logic
to Benjamin's historical materialism, working at the same time and very
nearly the same place on waking the nineteenth century from its
collective dream ("there is no resurrection none at all for the
nineteenth century, none" (Wars 104)). Does Stein's chronicle slide in
the direction of the hall of mirrors, that Arcade of Avant-Garde where
problems of representation are mistaken for history? The strangest
sentence in the Narration lectures all but invokes the project of the
Passagen in a statement of not-knowing which needs to be remembered in
any reading of Wars I Have Seen:

"It is worse than the wailing of the dead soldier in L'Aiglon there are
so many auditors there have been so many auditors, and there really can
only be the one that is the one, and there are so many of them there
have been so many of them and how can the historian lose them how can he
how can he lose any of them and how can he lose all of them and if he
does not how can history be writing that is be literature. How can it.
Well I am sure I do not know" (Narration 61). Wars I Have Seen opens
with the phrase: "I do not know."

"This makes literature words whether you choose them whether you use
them, whether they are there whether you use them, whether they are
there whether or not you use them and whether they are no longer there
even when you are still going on using them. And in this way a century
is a century. One century has words, another century chooses words,
another century uses words and then another century using the words no
longer has them" (Lectures 27).

In the face of the threat of the thought of the wars that are coming,
that writing in English now can no longer possess itself, its language,
must instead experience itself only as dispossessed, putting the lie to
purifying the dialect of the tribe or any kindred retrograde sanitizing
impulses and directions: injunctions. Writing as writing that is put out
of itself, taken from itself, broken off from itself, the sinthomatic
repetition that a century is generally a hundred years, repeated across
multiple texts from Stein's 1934 visit to the U.S., and returning in the
1943-44 chronicle, cannot be taken as a serious theoretical proposition
but as its negative: the nonsense sentence belabors the false obvious
and reiterates the shut-in time of the writing, what the writing is
caught inside of and the frame for which there is no outside.

in an ideal world poets' work would be valued by our society and poets would
be able to live doing their art in some way the unfortunate reality is that
most artists and especially poets have no choice but to do something to make
money to live. Many poets choose to become academics- I for one have
rejected this route only because I was already living and working when I
began to write poetry and prose.

I think however it is important not to depricate people for their choices
regarding how they make their living.  I look at Williams as a lodestar on
this he worked his whole life as a doctor and as a poet- there are many
people I know who are like this today-many of them on this list- the big
problem in my opinion with poetry is a lack of diversity of experience. I
find that many people have had the same life experiences in poetry and hence
allot of writing is not interesting or is interesting only to a few people.
How many more poems do we need from someone who grew up in a liberal suburb-
went to (Add Elite School Here) and then went to Iowa or Brown or NYU and is
now living in New York writing?

I think that serious poets exist in many areas and I know Bill Fuller from
whom this string originated- and while he is a senior executive here in
Chicago and lives in one of Chicago's richest suburbs- his poetry has real
merit and like Pound who lived as a a dilitante, and Williams who lived as a
doctor and Stevens who lived as an insurance salesman Bill Fuller's work has
value not for his lifestyle choices but because of th merit of the work.

You're thinking of poets who PUBLISH posthumously. If you want my take on
writers (not necessarily poets) who actually WRITE posthumously, check these

Herb -- this is great information. Most of it I know, but I've never seen
it laid out quite like this. Having served on an NEA panel (not for
writers' fellowships), I can say that Herb's description of the actual
deliberations process is very good. I'd also add that, with the array of
people on the panels, even if there is one person on a panel in favor of
"innovative" proposals, and even if that person ranks such proposals as
highly as possible and ranks others very low, it's still likely that such
proposals will not be funded, or, as Herb says, will only receive 1 or 2
(grants or fellowships) rather than the many we on this list may think they
deserve. And to think that a majority of panelists on any NEA panel might
favor "innovative" practices is just not realistic.

The other thing I wanted to add to this discussion has to do with why there
are still fellowships given to writers. My recollection is that in
1993-94-95 (or thereabouts), when the most draconian of cuts hit the NEA,
and when plans took shape to eliminate individual fellowships in the other
arts, Gigi Bradford, who was head of NEA Literature programs, assisted by
Jim Sitter (then head of CLMP and a sometime advisor to the NEA, lobbyist
to Congress on behalf of the arts, etc.), and probably a few others, worked
very hard to preserve the writers' fellowships, and their argument was
based on an analysis of the field of literature, nationwide, that
determined that the literary field was really weak in terms of its
organizations that might be funded -- yes there were some writer's centers,
presses, etc. -- but even the largest of their budgets didn't begin to
compare to major dance companies, theatre companies, art museums, etc.
Also, the literary organizations were weak in the sense that there wasn't a
lot of partnership between and among them. And, by far the greatest funding
of the NEA to literature was through fellowships, which wasn't ever true in
the other arts. So, if the NEA writers' fellowships had been eliminated,
there was a very strong chance that the NEA literary funding would have
just been eliminated altogether, or it would have been so small that the
lit programs might have been partnered with folk arts or some other
programs, or in some major way shunted aside. Those who cared and worked
hard at it were successful in preserving these fellowships, which helped
them to be successful in preserving funding for other literary
organizations, too. And while I agree that the majority of this funding
goes to individuals and organizations that I don't think are the most
crucial, I'm not convinced that shutting down all NEA funding for
literature would be a good thing at all.

I'm one of those who, like Herb speculates, usually doesn't apply for the
fellowships, although I think I should. I wish all of you would. But even
if we all do, I'm not sure it will change the fact that only one or two
"innovative" writers might receive such fellowships in any given year. I
think the possibilities of getting involved in a way that shift funding
opportunities at least slightly more toward innovators, are better on the
local and possibly state levels, where you can more easily go to meetings,
get on committees, artists' panels, advisory panels, etc. Of course this is
going to differ from locality to locality and state to state, and it may
involve a lot of down-and-dirty networking that doesn't appeal to a lot of
you. But it will lead, as Herb indicates, to being better informed about
the processes that determine governmental funding in the arts, and if you
want to change it, knowing about it can't hurt.

I want to end my participation in this thread by summing up my thoughts on
this.
 To think that how you make your living, what you spend at least one-third
of your day doing, and the people you spend that time with, doesn't effect
your work, for better or for worse, is to be naive about how the human mind
forms itself. This is not a value judgment, just an observation. There are
people who can and do operate on several levels at once--T.S. Eliot and
Wallace Stevens are two notable examples--, but they are the exceptions.
There are always exceptions. But for the most part, as Maurice Merleau-Ponty
pointed out, one lives the life one must live in order to do the work one
must do.

I'm saying this mainly for young poets to take into account. As your
life-experience gathers behind you, what that experience is, how varied, how
far off-the-beaten-track it is will brace the body of your art as it
develops. And who you are as a mature poet, what you have to say at that
point will be telling of the life you've lived.

If I may add a thought to this discussion of businessman poets...

Most of us seem to believe, to varying degrees, in the Romantic myth of the
artist as separate from the rest of society. Some of us are actively trying
to confront that mythology, even as it has seeped under our skin so deeply
as to clog the success of our confrontation.

But two things are missing: one is an acknowledgement of the two poems
printed at the bottom of that original Chicago Tribune article, and the
other is stock-taking of what the poet-execs said about the purposes of
poetry.

I for one thought Ted Kooser's poems were both quite good. They didn't
achieve astounding greatness, and I'd probably be annoyed if Kooser were to
get an NEA grant (let alone be named Poet Laureate), but there is nothing
embarrassing about these poems at all. Just because they aren't exactly as
edgy as my taste and style would like them to be, I can't deny that they are
polished, professional (as opposed to amateur) pieces of work (by the way:
could this be relevant to the discussion about whether rap is or isn't
serious music? Rap and pop and Classical are different genres; is anything
wrong with different genres of poetry being represented in different
arenas?). And that in itself suggests that poets can survive within the
alter-egos of businessmen. Whether Pritzker, Smith, or Fuller is as good,
though, is another question, which gets us to the other point.

That other point is about what these businessmen said about poetry:

> > Execs say writing poetry helps improve their form Poet-executives
> > fight stress, reclaim individuality, express emotions, gain
> > stability and transform daily experiences in `strangely restorative'
> > exercise

As true as this must be, it doesn't get us beyond the high-school writing
workshop idea of poetry. This is where we get the difference between poets
and people who write poems. Being a poet requires a certain seriousness
about poetry, and writing to fight stress doesn't cut it for me. Matter of
fact, I say writing poetry adds as much stress as it relieves, because for
every thought I'm not having about the world around me, I'm having another
for the strength of the words I'm writing. I've never found writing poetry
restorative at all, strangely or mundanely.

But these two points commingle method and product. What matters most is
product. We all have our own methods, which we're always bound to disagree
upon, but what matters most is product. Whether you believe in 'first
thought best thought' or 'the disillusion of the ego' or 'a trance-like
state', what matters most is what comes out of the other end of the pen (or
keyboard). What Stevens, Eliot, Williams, even Kooser, demonstrate is that a
poet can have a day job as an executive or professional. Whether a poet
should have such a career is a discussion about method, and is always at
base individual and prejudicial, and doesn't amount to much more than a
discussion of whether white people can sing the blues.

I think that the issue is how much life have you accumulated.

Poetry, Painting, Sculpture, Art in general is not work it is a vocation a
calling. I believe that people who have had rich diverse lives and who
continue to be engaged on many levels can produce good art and good poetry
and make time for that.

I believe that people who spend all their time "creating" and are not
engaged in society, politics, family other work are not fully human and
create poetry that is less than. I recently interviewed Regis Bonvicino the
great Brazilian poet and he is a judge and poet and he chastises American
poets for not being political and not being engaged in the basics of society
poets in other nations are politicians for example Dominique de Villpian in
France was Foreign Minister and a Poet. Neruda was a diplomat and a poet et
cetera they did a nice job one their poetry no?

What I say to young poets is dont write anything- get out there and live. In
my 20's I worked and lived overseas, I put myself on the line as a volunteer
in very hard circumstances and this life honing experience made me a better
and richer human being, in the spiritual sense of the word. I say LIVE LIVE
LIVE poetry will come-

If you want to be a poet, be a poet, but the canvas in which you paint your
life is essential all of it paying bills, working in business, travelling,
seeing the world as it is and growing as a person dont let your desire the
be "genuine" to not "Sell out" keep you from living life and sucking the
marrow out of its bones.

Joel, before you hangup on this thread, what differentiates between a
young poet & a mature poet?  I think of myself as a young poet tho I've
been writing, publishing & editing since the mid 70s, & I still seem to
have an adverse reaction to thinking of myself as a mature poet which I
read to mean ossified tho Im pretty sure you're meaning it in a whole
other way.

That is, I am afraid, an absurd statement. You effect poetry by writing
it.
It is not effected by a set of circumstances affecting your life.

From Juan Cole's blog http://www.juancole.com/

Supporting Nawal Saadawi

Al-Hayat on Saturday ran an attack from a Muslim fundamentalist point of
view on Egyptian novelist Nawal Saadawi. She recently argued that children
should all receive hyphenated last names, from both the mother's and the
father's side, instead of only the last name of the father. She said that
this method would allow families to acknowledge the equal contribution of
each parent to the child.

The Al-Hayat article ridiculed and attacked Saadawi. It quoted Shaikh Yusuf
al-Qaradawi at length on how here suggestion is contrary to Islamic law
(though al-Qaradawi did not actually demonstrate this allegation, and most
of his points were just the ramblings of a male chauvinist. Al-Qaradawi is
an elderly, old-time Muslim Brotherhood activist now settled in Qatar. He
can sometimes be unconventional, but not on issues like this.

The the article quoted Camillia Hilmi, a woman Muslim fundamentalist who is
Phyllis Schlafly's Arab twin. She went on at length about how there is a
wicked feminist cabal in the West that hates men and wants to exterminate
them so that women can rule the world. She also accused them of tampering
with the New Testament, so as to make God a woman in their text. She said
that unfortunately, this feminist cabal dominated the committees of the
United Nations. She then complained that Saadawi has fallen under their
malevolent influence.

Saadawi has long been a target of Egyptian Muslim fundamentalists, and even
made the secular government of Anwar El Sadat nervous enough to arrest her.
She wrote a novel about Sadat, The Fall of the Imam . It enraged the
religious right in Egypt. The Al-Azhar Seminary has recently started a
campaign to have it formally banned by the Egyptian government. Please sign
the letter of solidarity for Nawal Saadawi on the Web.

Hey Miekal:

It doesn't so much have to do with age as with having gone through the
process of mimesis, which students must do, and arriving at what is uniquely
you. In this sense, most poets never mature, and so we see that most poetry
looks and sounds alike. On the other hand, some mature early--Gary Snyder,
Robert Creeley, come quickly to mind. And if one's work reaches maturity,
this is when, as with satori, the real work begins.It is the opposite of
ossification, but an expansive release of creative energy from an
experiential base, one that may last a lifetime. Thus, Michelangelo was
doing his most mature, innovative carving in his 80s.

Joel,

I'm a secular existentialist, and considering that, you could never define
nor decide for me the difference between art and living. Of course, that's not
going to stop anyone and everyone from trying to pontificate thusly. Poetry,
personal philosophy, and how one 'executes' their lives are inseparable. When
poetrying, we take from the bits and pieces of our integrated (or maybe not so
much) self and create. If my life is a living hell of meaningless or possibly
unethical labor, who more than I to write of such misery? It's the height of
philosophical hubris to assume that an individual's creative work can be
polluted by occupation. Of course, there may be exceptions, like a professional
assassin, but even then who better to explain to us her individual angst. I jest.
But don't go there with ethics. Ethics aren't even definable in the absence of
proven truth. We decide for ourselves.

A job is a job and art is art and sometimes the twain does meet, but only in
the Being not the Nothing. In the nothing you can't write posthumously - great
stuff Vernon. What great links to put ego and vanity in perspective. In the
end we end up anonymous and anthologized, if we're lucky.

This made me laugh, George.  It applies in spades to women - with that
attitude goes the idea that, say, women who do such anerotic things as
looking after children can't write interetsing poems (such things have been
said to me, so I know some people think that way).  Surely Emily D hardly
had an interesting life?

Writers very often lead dull lives.  They're writers, for godsake.  It's not
exactly a spectator sport.  As you say, you effect poetry by writing it.

I was disturbed to learn that a well-known
critic of innovative poetry has been quoted
as pointing out that if "You do not make it as a poet by
your 40's you will not make it at all."

What might this critic have meant by that?

George: When I began years ago my training as a therapist I realized that I
was being taught not just a set of skills but a stance towards life lived
within and without. Those who never leave school may not realize this--the
extent to which they've been acculturated by that environment. I know I
hadn't in all the prior years of education and university work. It did
change the way I write--why not? it changed the way I did everything
else--altho I think I've written all of four poems that treat the material
of doing therapy directly.

Or is making things with language uniquely separate from the investigations
we all make in navigating the language of daily life?

I would agree that to say that only the exceptional can incorporate the way
one has been changed by working in a bank is way over into overstatement,
if not absurdity. But I understand where Joel is coming from. In an
environment in which being a banker/poet is as far out on an experiential
edge as being a hobo/poet the risk is rather in the monoculture that poetry
can become when the daily lives of poets tend to be about the tilling of
any one field, even academia, because it's known and appears to be less
risky than lives led outside the class or cultural norm.

Risk-free poetry produced by risk-averse poets is the last thing we need.
The distribution of talent is never democratic, but the poetry of those not
endowed with an unusual amount of it needn't be as crashingly boring as
most of what seems to be being produced, in every camp, has become.

OK, time for my meds.

that might apply to chess player or a tennis player but not to poetry or
other literature or as we know art (Grandma Moses) - and alot of poiets were
dead for hundreds of years before they were "discovered" ..and so on...


It makes no diff. what one does in life - but certainly one needs to live
and we all fodo taht so we are all in differentwasy equiped to write and of
course reading is essential (as wide and deep as extensicve and intense as
possible) - although the NZ "street poet" who sells poems he has written on
silver-backed cardbord fro $5 each writes simple but sometimes
beayutifulnpoems and I wonce said to him - "You dont know muchof literature
etc do you?" and he replied, quite unabashed:  - "Yes - I am illiterate"

But we all know people like Kendrick Sithyman (NZ) Ron Silliman, Piert van
Taubmann and Stein and Pound etc and many have read various of the classics
and the modern critcis and philosphers etc but not my friend the "Street
Poet"  (Noodle String he calls himself - he is a very tall Australian fellow
as it happens): ho! I say ho! Good on us all ! - We are all skinning
poetic-cats in different ways.

"The word is skrewed, skewed, bent back on itself in a gorgeous torsion to
tremblingness: and in that dialectical division leading to ferment, a
terrible but pale light causes us to fixate on the [subconscious] E sign
that - like a 'possible-tron' - vanishes before we can think on it."  Tina
Darragh (on Derrida and Jacobson etc).

I was once told that Marjorie Perloff had said this to him. I did not take
it seriously. I figured that this is just another occasional instance of MP
making a whacky, imperious self-serving, statement. I can't see that it
serves anybody else. At best - to look on the good side -it's perhaps a
productive taunt from a significant and important critic for everyone to try
harder and prove her statement wrong.  I also suspect the next several posts
will provide much evidence already proving the statement to be empty headed.
(This is without going into - or wanting to go into what constitutes the
sometimes - at least what I consider dubious - characteristics of some poets
who are considered to have publicly "made it.")

Another part of the problem raised here is that poetry at the "assigned"
margins - if we say the public center is represented in last weeks NY Times
Book Review Poetry issue  - currently has no other major critic than Perloff
to counter and question her claims. It seems true to me - with some
exceptions - the poets who have been critically celebrated by her become
publicly quiet at the wheel when she goes off the hook with some of her
statements.

Given the poverty of critical attention, I understand the apprehension. But
gosh, it must be privately infuriating.

Which is to say, finally, that the 'age statement' can only be genuinely
contested by new, and equally fierce critics. Undoubtedly there are new ones
rising to the fore. I think that will help keep Perlhoff honest and
interesting, too. I am sure she would not take it kindly, for example, if
some young upstart declares that no critic over sixty has ever written
anything new or interesting and that it's all over "for them."!

Back to writing, I say, and with compassion to all!

Mark Weiss' recent post is of particular interest to me for a number
of reasons. I was an English major in college, an honors
student, but I decided, even though I respected and admired most of the
professors I was working with immensely, I could
not proceed with a career in academia. I went into therapy,
and later also became a therapist,  and a psychoanalyst, while continuing
to remain a participant in contemporary literature, to
the extent I could find the time and inclination. One concern
that I have written about many times, on this list and
elsewhere- and in many of my poems- which I chose
to call instead "theoretical objects"- is the danger of "pretentiousness"
both in poetry and the poetry life. It seems to me one
risk that occurs with those who are frequently listened to,
whose words are carefully thought about, and eventually
celebrated, at least by some other poets, is a tendency towards taking their
hierarchical status- within the halls of letters, so to speak- a bit
too--what shall I say?--portentously, perhaps. Even when
I was a young, inexperienced college student, I could sense
that the frequently encountered quality of didactic intoning,
one might call it,  masked a conscientiously concealed, but nonetheless
obvious weariness with the texts that they were concerned-and charged- with
protecting, preserving, praising and interpreting. None dare call it
boredom! Clearly, a therapist no doubt faces some parallel risks and
tendencies. The frequently praised writings
of the British psychoanalyst Adam Phillips strike me as crashingly
boring, as I experienced most of the (translated, enigmatic) writing of the
celebrated Jacques Lacan  decades ago; though I frequently enjoyed
work by writers who claimed to be influenced by his work.

This leads into the final words in Mark Weiss' statement: his
ideas about why certain poems are "boring." Though continuous efforts
are made in the halls of literature to separate, isolate and elevate the
wheat from the chaff, it seems to me that the constant efforts of this very
process puts the focus on the food critics instead of the food, on the
gourmet aspect rather than the aspect of nutrition, so to speak. It seems
to me that when so many are starving for what poets and poetry have
to offer, clearly, in most cases without knowing it, that the challenge
is to define those issues, the "resistances", so to speak, to the effects or
goals of poetry, rather than blame the quality of the poetry being written;
or turn to the "market" analyses of the professional critics. The common
enemy of the kind of persons interested in poetry, it seems to
me, is superficiality, not lack of entertainment satisfaction or the
assurance of being in the presence of proven greatness.

I think what makes the "career" of poetry so wearying is not the writing
of the poetry, or even having to support it by other means than
the activities of literature, or dealing with its reception, or lack
thereof, but the  hierarchical attitudes within the field of poetry itself.
I once asked Ed Friedman,when he was still the Artistic Director of the
Poetry Project, if the PP might sponsor a seminar on the topic of the
"Career of the Poet." His answer was that he viewed poetry as a "calling"
not a career. Virtually every serious, lifelong practicing poet has more in
common with other poets than differences, whatever kind of poetry they write
and however their work has been received. Most of the disagreements
and failure to cooperate stems form how the activities and products of this
field are regarded, it seems to me, on the whole, outside the field of
literature. The problem is that most poets then tend to take out those
feelings,  the results of those issues, on others within the field, since
nobody else seems to care, instead of confronting
them and overcoming them together. Some of this is worked on by
a few, very conscientiously. I will pick on Bob Holman, as an excellent
example of a person who has spent his life trying to do something
constructive about all this, rather than complain about it so much the way
I tend to. So maybe one thing to do about all this is to go to the Bowery
Poetry Club as often as possible! [I'm somewhat kidding, of course,
since readings and the issues surrounding readings are only one important
aspect of the field].

This person's pronouncement could affect me in major ways. I didn't start
writing poetry seriously until I was 36, after 21 years of writing fiction.
I was 47 when I first performed at the Nuyorican, 55 when I read at the
Poetry Project and people started reading my work online. I could have died
from Cancer between ages 23 and 28. So, either by this person's standards
I'm lining up to make my run for the Archie Moore or George Foreman of
contemporary poetry or ---damn! --- maybe I AM writing posthumously.

From a female (former and hopefully future) manager's perspective, I
would like to make this discussion so very much more complex than it is
now, somehow.  There is so much play between "like it should be"
according to so many "them" and how one knows it has to be for oneself.


Early in what became my first career (and is unfortunately looking like
it will be my second career), I did look to poets like Eliot (Pound
"saved" him from the bank / himself), Williams, et.al.  I did feel that
by having a day job, I was broadening my experience.  Also, while being
a female technologist was a day in day out blow to self confidence, the
paychecks were a nice counterbalance to what sometimes feels like
constant utter writing failure.

The same argument (the experience is good for you, makes you better,
more, etc.) is made for children as is made for "real jobs".  That you
can never know what it is like to -- blah blah -- that are you really
human if you don't -- etc etc -- that you're not participating in the
larger society -- and I think that got mentioned here in a small way.
Maybe it should be mentioned in a big way.  I feel the societal and
familial pressure for a woman -- me, any woman -- to have children,
followed by the lack of value placed on mothers and children in the same
society -- is the same sort of pressure that bears on poet / career,
poet / artist, and artist / money situations.  Blatant and outrageous
misunderstanding of what it is to work and write is everywhere.

I don't pretend I would be a poet who would visit a shopping mall like I
would visit Mars.  But -- why are sitcoms so not funny?  Why do most
broad comedies not elicit laughter (except for the schtick?)? Why is
Billy Collins  dull? (though I do find the Victoria Secret
discomfiting)?  Many of these stories sell something (via product
placement), but they also sell something by their situation, through
their story.  So they are extraordinarily dull if you're outside the
situation / audience / market. While I'd love to slag Jim Belushi,
sitcoms aren't funny because they're selling stereotypes very seriously.
And that is not funny.  For the same reason, I cringe whenever W makes a
joke about making / not making his wife do public speaking followed by
the sure dry chuckle it elicits from his audience.

I waste a lot of time worrying that my detailed knowledge about luxury
objects is evil.  But I DO write a great deal about them.  I DO have a
nearly-book-length project having to do with cooking... and the fashion
designer poems in Da3 are a blend of criticism about the designs and
writings / quotes from the designers.

All best,
Catherine Daly

You seem to be speaking from both sides of the issue, which certainly makes
things more complex.  My own part of this discussion was more about the
health of poetry than about the health of individual poets. The problem, it
seems to me, is the similarity of experience that the institutionalization
of poetry has led to. Let's for a moment imagine Milton without his day job
or in a parsonage like Herrick. He wrote some pretty wonderful poetry
before taking on his political role, but Lycidas, which marks the decision
to do so, is I think the best of the early work, and his day job gave us
Paradise Lost, among a great deal else the best political poem in the
language. Tho the job kept him away from verse for a decade.

Behind this discussion is I think another. I take George Bowering's
statement that "you effect poetry by writing it. It is not effected by a
set of circumstances affecting your life" as expressing an extreme
aestheticist position. Sure, you have to decide to write it in order to
write, a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. But that's not the
whole of it.
Unless a poem is just "a machine made of words" (an aestheticist
pronouncement by one of the most engaged of poets) experience
matters--having in whatever sense decided to write one writes out of the
breadth of who we are, and that breadth (or narrowness) of being is
expressed in everything we write, regardless of intention. Otherwise we
risk being about as interesting as crossword puzzles, which are also
machines made of words.

Subject: Re: poetrying

Mark Weiss' recent post is of particular interest to me for a number
of reasons. I was an English major in college, an honors
student, but I decided, even though I respected and admired most of the
professors I was working with immensely, I could
not proceed with a career in academia. I went into therapy,
and later also became a therapist,  and a psychoanalyst, while continuing
to remain a participant in contemporary literature, to
the extent I could find the time and inclination. One concern
that I have written about many times, on this list and
elsewhere- and in many of my poems- which I chose
to call instead "theoretical objects"- is the danger of "pretentiousness"
both in poetry and the poetry life. It seems to me one
risk that occurs with those who are frequently listened to,
whose words are carefully thought about, and eventually
celebrated, at least by some other poets, is a tendency towards taking their
hierarchical status- within the halls of letters, so to speak- a bit
too--what shall I say?--portentously, perhaps. Even when
I was a young, inexperienced college student, I could sense
that the frequently encountered quality of didactic intoning,
one might call it,  masked a conscientiously concealed, but nonetheless
obvious weariness with the texts that they were concerned-and charged- with
protecting, preserving, praising and interpreting. None dare call it
boredom! Clearly, a therapist no doubt faces some parallel risks and
tendencies. The frequently praised writings
of the British psychoanalyst Adam Phillips strike me as crashingly
boring, as I experienced most of the (translated, enigmatic) writing of the
celebrated Jacques Lacan  decades ago; though I frequently enjoyed
work by writers who claimed to be influenced by his work.

This leads into the final words in Mark Weiss' statement: his
ideas about why certain poems are "boring." Though continuous efforts
are made in the halls of literature to separate, isolate and elevate the
wheat from the chaff, it seems to me that the constant efforts of this very
process puts the focus on the food critics instead of the food, on the
gourmet aspect rather than the aspect of nutrition, so to speak. It seems
to me that when so many are starving for what poets and poetry have
to offer, clearly, in most cases without knowing it, that the challenge
is to define those issues, the "resistances", so to speak, to the effects or
goals of poetry, rather than blame the quality of the poetry being written;
or turn to the "market" analyses of the professional critics. The common
enemy of the kind of persons interested in poetry, it seems to
me, is superficiality, not lack of entertainment satisfaction or the
assurance of being in the presence of proven greatness.

I think what makes the "career" of poetry so wearying is not the writing
of the poetry, or even having to support it by other means than
the activities of literature, or dealing with its reception, or lack
thereof, but the  hierarchical attitudes within the field of poetry itself.
I once asked Ed Friedman,when he was still the Artistic Director of the
Poetry Project, if the PP might sponsor a seminar on the topic of the
"Career of the Poet." His answer was that he viewed poetry as a "calling"
not a career. Virtually every serious, lifelong practicing poet has more in
common with other poets than differences, whatever kind of poetry they write
and however their work has been received. Most of the disagreements
and failure to cooperate stems form how the activities and products of this
field are regarded, it seems to me, on the whole, outside the field of
literature. The problem is that most poets then tend to take out those
feelings,  the results of those issues, on others within the field, since
nobody else seems to care, instead of confronting
them and overcoming them together. Some of this is worked on by
a few, very conscientiously. I will pick on Bob Holman, as an excellent
example of a person who has spent his life trying to do something
constructive about all this, rather than complain about it so much the way
I tend to. So maybe one thing to do about all this is to go to the Bowery
Poetry Club as often as possible! [I'm somewhat kidding, of course,
since readings and the issues surrounding readings are only one important
aspect of the field].

George:

I think I nearly share your sense of poetry and work, wanting to avoid any
deterministic notion that wagelabor and such produce a poetry (or not). But as
you bring in Zukofsky, Williams, Niedecker, et al it has me thinking too about
how crucial sometimes lousy work turned out to be in their writing. I spent
some time reading Zukofsky's WPA research essays on American crafts (his paid,
day job) against contemporary portions of "A". One wishes him a "better job" or
perhaps even a fellowship! But the poem wouldn't be the same. No
transcendence there.

a friend  once  told,   a good friend,  and completely  unrecognized
poet,  as was i for many yrs  and by and large  still am  mostly for my
own  fault and reasons, that poetry was an old man's  game   i said thank
you mr rimbaud  also had a teacher once who said  your best stuff gets
written  before  you are 19  thank you mr takuboku   well finally  after
i hit 50  i jumped into the fray even tho i've been writing poems
practicularly and artsy fartsing around  since i was able to pick up a
pencil and pen.  that same friend  also said that all you need to write
poetry is precisely that  a pencil and a piece of paper unlike say, music
 and painting
well he was right on both counts in my case  because i started to try
playing the game  way  too late  and still fumble the ball alot  tho like
vernon  at 58 i finally got my gig at the poetry  project ( thru weird
circumstances  which some on this  list   squabbled  about for at least a
week) tho my absence from the scene  sure accounts for that  and most of
the folk i know who "made it" and who are making it  are and have done so

urge


did i say dissemination? darwin's dis/ease. i'm too smart, too aware i'm
writing just to continue, assert presence, inscribe. place my mark like
every other smart little boy and girl. graffiti the indefinite walls of
cyberspace. what i say is irrelevant. it's all in the action, spraying
this, that, every other site, building up recognition capital on google.

i want to escape my genes. i can't meditate for more than thirty seconds.
my shakuhachi playing lasts a couple of minutes and i'm on to something
else. i have to leave my mark everywhere. i recognize the compulsion. i
write about the compulsion and against the compulsion.

i'd like to see bush dead. his compulsion ruins the world. i see my ugly
face reflected in his ugly face. i scrawl here; he scrawls there. i scrawl
virtual; he scrawls real. maybe he even thinks about it.

if i don't spray nightly, i'm lost. my body turns against me; my dreams
become nightmares worse than usual, endless, vicious. the flesh deflates,
potency gone; the mind evaporates. i'm aware of the illness. i can
deconstruct the illness. i can work through it and the illness is at the
other end.

the illness is our illness.

contrary to belief, there are no borders to the blog, just boarders. there
are borders on the list. one comes up against another. one response is
always out of control of the other. list territory is psychological
territory, a wager. it is a wager of the real, not of the virtual, but in
the virtual.

it is useless at this end, my end. every publication is another brick,
another ward against death. the recordings, books, videos, anthologies,
magazines, tapes, dvds, cdroms, pile up like debris. i look on one side
and see nothing. i look over to the other side; there's nothing there.

there's the urge and it pushes. it mixes with wonder which is perhaps its
excuse or perhaps what's left of a humanity i want to hold to. but the
urge is a sickness, the sickness of a mad species, a mad specimen, the
madness of the obsessive individual. write or die.

years ago i had up on the wall: i write myself into existence. i write
myself out of existence. the inscription is all there is. the inscription
gives me the fairy-tale, the fantasy, fantasm, imaginary, image, of
survival after death. of promulgation ad infinitum. of gene-pools no
longer at the mercy of the flesh.

this is my politics. it is probably everyone's. we take positions,
backwards and forwards, of withdrawal as well. meditation is a position as
rigid as others. we hold to them. we work with them, work towards them.
we're genetically driven. we're tagging everything in site. we're tagging
everyone and every other. we're tagging the planet, we're sprawl/scrawl.

there's false joy in this. i'm aware of the falseness, crash constantly. i
write another, yet another piece. 'artist' is an excuse for tagging of
every kind, out of control, unstructured, desperate. tagging is an excuse
for inscription, leaving genetic debris, named or anonymous, but always
named, everywhere in sight, in site, in cite. the wonder follows, fallow.

bush kills, bushwhacks. we are responsible for millions of tiny murders,
day by day. powerless, we do the same. every letter is a violence,
occupies space, defends itself, within and without spell-check. it's the
urge. i know it and can't fight it. we're talking, scrawling, unto death.

the light that can be seen and can't be named: the brain shutting down,
just before everything goes black. we'll all be there, emptied out. we're
gone before we started.

That might apply to chess player or a tennis player but not to poetry or
other literature or as we know art (Grandma Moses) - and a lot of poets were
dead for hundreds of years before they were"discovered" ..and so on...
  It makes no diff. what one does in life - but certainly one needs to live
and we all have to do that so we are all in different ways equiped to write
and of course reading is essential (as wide and deep and as extensive and
intense as possible) - although the NZ "street poet" who sells poems he has
written on
silver-backed cardboard for $5 each writes simple but sometimes beautiful
poems and I once said to him -

"You dont know much of literature, do you Noodle?"
 and he replied, quite unabashed:

 "Yes, you are quite right - I am illiterate"

 But we all know people like Kendrick Smithyman (NZ) Ron Silliman, Piert van
Taubmann,Stevens,Celan,Shakespear,Steve Dalachinskly, Ben Jonson,  Stein and
Pound etc and many have read various of the classics and the modern critics
and philosphers etc but not my friend the "Street Poet"  (Noodle String he
calls himself - he is a very tall Australian fellow as it happens):

Ho! Ho! I say, Ho! Good on us all ! - We are all skinning various poetic
cats in different ways.

"The word is skrewed, skewed, bent back on itself in a gorgeous torsion to
tremblingness: and in that dialectical division leading to ferment, a
terrible but intruded pale light causes us to fixate on the [subconscious] E
sign that - like a 'possible-tron' - vanishes before we can think on it."

 Tina Darragh (writing on Derrida and Jacobson etc).

Great post Nick - do you recall Lacan's famous (albeit now very boring):

"That which has itself self-divided in Self-making X* Perplexity three times
through and through and outside the bewilderdnessness - mirror of
itself -screams only to be, and in due concede, celebrates only it's
pre-conscious death-life in the wonder endlessly unfolding of into and
around the I or the We of Openness,and indeed, by a neo-Freudian
transmutation into the Ego (begrudged by the Id) or into and around  the
speech or indeed the Say or the Z-essay whence lust has its especial
provenance."  ??  *

* I have never been sure of the addition of the X here - what is its import
here? Indeed the Z also puzzles me - but then Alan S can (to take another
philospher poet example) be very complex and unexpected - ( often in his
'joiussance'  - great jets of coming semantic (for it is surely also an
erotic project ( refer to Alan Sondheim's project of course)) and exuberance
veritably burns thru the nueronic nerve net in his projects (whose fragments
only we can see - and what immensity of potential connectivities and "
'openions'  (thought here is becoming chemical as cations or (dog!)ions
whiskered the illicit spools ((spilling) into eggs of Not) to opening out"
lies beyond we cannnot conceive at this historical (hsyterical?) point): we
are joyously flamed as has been said..or mooted: the swift changes of
language, the beating of the immensity and pathos of the poor human voice
(lurking mostly in preconscious space and indeed in a kind of proleptic dark
or stupor ) sub speciae aeternitatis  - in the realm - human though -  and
the sudden intrusion of the Child into a complex technical discourse (the
Father) and the sparking semantic showers to flow into or around us and
indeed flow becomes flower (and we in OUR turn flower, indeed) - (and) the
trangression and animus intensity of whose Guilty Laugh - the haha of Time -
enjoins us { if we can  'stay the course'}  into a joyous joining and the
beginning of mutterings from the very core of what we thought we were -or
are - and so on: an example indeed of 'complexity as method' (Charles
Bernstein)

 - to be applauded sometimes, indeed it might be seen by some as 'totality
as method' or somesuch (one is beautifully baffled and perhaps cornered into
a kingdom whose "cagean lake of silence' (Richard Taylor) [ where silence is
not silence but its negation made infinite] or indeed the applause breaks
out from those long dead white beards of noise irritating like some
self-cultured pearl self-striving in shell darkness (furiously sea-tussling
with the sleeping green thoughts))  - such epistemological reflections cause
us pause indeed (as if the "scop": had struck up his lyre amongst us ! The
ancient tale! The Dragon Slayer who himself is (ultimately)
slain.....(perhaps by his own weapons - words - or 'wapfons') The struggle
contines - we sleep , we eat..who are we??..." )).

I think that in contrast to Your "Theoretical Objects" - which I admire a
lot - I bought it via the net: Lacan veers into that realm of
self-congratulation and complexity and perhaps some would (unkindly?)
surmise - turgidity - whilst being a greatly astute
philosopher/psychologist/literary theorist (and nfluenced a young friend of
mine (did a PhD on him )) one Michael Arnold of NZ. (He's not a Marxist -

writer/poet). But I feel that such writing as sported above by Monsieur
Lacan - difficult and seemingly meaningless - what is meaningless? - is
nevertheless stimulating to certain persons who can working abstract realms.

Some would say Lacan overdid things.

And of course another writer who is useful even if maybe flawed is Michel
Foucault whose:

" I go to sleep as an angel and wake as the devil."

haunts me to this day.

Jumping on this wagon -- one would think getting your bread elsewhere
would free up your poetry from having to pursue careerist or otherwise
commercial missions. At least that's the model I'm working on.

After all, what better purpose for working the J-O-B if not to fund the
continuance of American Lit -- it's like you are making your own arts grant.

Not saying the job doesn't get in the way of all the writing and reading
I wish I had more time for.

Subject: Orlando Weekly: Was the Election Hacked in Florida?

WAS IT HACKED?
By Alan Waldman
Orlando Weekly
Published 18 November 2004
http://frogblog.journalspace.com/

Despite mainstream media attempts to kill the story, talk radio and the
Internet are abuzz with suggestions that John Kerry was elected president on
Nov. 2 -- but Republican election officials made it difficult for millions
of Democrats to vote while employees of four secretive, GOP-bankrolled
corporations rigged electronic voting machines and then hacked central
tabulating computers to steal the election for George W. Bush.

The Bush administration's "fix" of the 2000 election debacle (the Help
America Vote Act) made crooked elections considerably easier, by foisting
paperless electronic voting on states before the bugs had been worked out or
meaningful safeguards could be installed.

Crying foul this time around isn't just the province of whiny Democrats.
Consider that The Wall Street Journal recently revealed that "Verified
Voting, a group formed by a Stanford University professor to assess
electronic voting, has collected 31,000 reports of election fraud and other
problems."

University of Pennsylvania researcher Dr. Steven Freeman, in his November
2004 paper "The Unexplained Exit Poll Discrepancy," says that the odds that
the discrepancies between predicted [exit poll] results and actual vote
counts in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania could have been due to chance or
random error are 250 million to 1. "Systematic fraud or mistabulation is a
premature conclusion," writes Freeman, "but the election's unexplained exit
poll discrepancies make it an unavoidable hypothesis, one that is the
responsibility of the media, academia, polling agencies, and the public to
investigate." Unlike Europe, where citizens count the ballots, in the United
States employees of a highly secretive Republican-leaning company, ES&S,
managed every aspect of the
2004 election. That included everything >from registering voters, printing
ballots and programming voting machines to tabulating votes (often with
armed guards keeping the media and members of the public who wished to
witness the count at bay) and reporting the results, for 60 million voters
in 47 states, according to Christopher Bollyn, writing in American Free
Press. Most other votes were counted by three other firms that are snugly in
bed with the GOP.

This election is not the first suspicious venture into electronic voting. In
Georgia, in November 2002, Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes led by
11 percent and Democratic Sen. Max Cleland was in front by 5 percent just
before the election -- the first ever conducted entirely on touch- screen
electronic machines, and counted entirely by company employees, rather than
public officials -- but mysterious election-day swings of 16 percent and 12
percent defeated both of these popular incumbents. In Minnesota, Democrat
Walter Mondale (replacing beloved Sen. Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane
crash), lost in an amazing last-moment 11 percent vote swing recorded on
electronic machines. Then, in 2003, what's known as "black box voting"
helped Arnold Schwarzenegger -- who had deeply offended female, Latino and
Jewish voters -- defeat a popular Latino Democrat who substantially led in
polls a week before the election.

A RAT IS SMELLED

Realizing that the 2004 election results are suspect, many prominent people
and groups have begun to demand action. Recently, six important Congressmen,
including three on the House Judiciary Committee, asked the U.S. Comptroller
General to investigate the efficacy of new electronic voting devices.

Black Box Voting -- the nonprofit group which spearheaded much of the
pre-election testing (and subsequent criticism) of electronic machines that
found them hackable in 90 seconds -- is filing the largest Freedom of
Information Act inquiry in U.S. history. The organization's Bev Harris
claims, "Fraud took place in the 2004 election through electronic voting
machines."

Florida Democratic congressional candidate Jeff Fisher charged that he has
and will show the FBI evidence that Florida results were hacked; he also
claims to have knowledge of who hacked it -- in 2004 and in the
2002 Democratic primary (so Jeb Bush would not have to run against the
popular Janet Reno). Fisher also believes that most Democratic candidates
nationwide were harmed by GOP hacking and other dirty tactics
-- particularly in swing states.

The Green and Libertarian Parties, as well as Ralph Nader, are demanding an
Ohio recount, because of voting fraud, suppression and disenfranchisement.
Recounts are also being sought in New Hampshire, Nevada and Washington.

Although the Internet is full of stories of election fraud, and major media
in England, Canada and elsewhere have investigated the story, you'll find
almost nothing in the major U.S. media. "I have been told by sources that
are fairly high up in the media -- particularly TV -- that there is now a
lockdown on this story," says Harris. "It's officially 'Let's move on'
time." On Nov. 6, Project Censored Award-winning author Thom Hartmann said,
"So far, the only national 'mainstream' media outlet to come close to this
story was Keith Olbermann, when he noted that it was curious that all the
voting machine irregularities so far uncovered seemed to favor Bush. In the
meantime, the Washington Post and other media are now going through
single-bullet-theory-like contortions to explain how the exit polls had
failed."

VOTE STEALING 101

Votes collected by electronic machines (and by optical scan equipment that
reads traditional paper ballots) are sent via modem to a central tabulating
computer, which counts the votes on Windows software.
Therefore, anyone who knows how to operate an Excel spreadsheet and who is
given access to the central tabulation machine can, in theory, change
election totals.

On a CNBC cable TV program, Black Box Voting exec Harris showed guest host
Howard Dean how to alter vote totals within 90 seconds, by entering a
two-digit code in a hidden program on Diebold's election software.
Harris declared, "This is not a 'bug' or accidental oversight; it is there
on purpose."

A quartet of companies control the U.S. vote count. Diebold, ES&S, Sequoia
and SAIC are all hard-wired into the Bush campaign and power structure.
Diebold chief Walden O'Dell is a top Bush fund-raiser.
According to "online anarchist community" Infoshop.org, "At Diebold, the
election division is run by Bob Urosevich. Bob's brother, Todd, is a top
executive at 'rival' ES&S. The brothers were originally staked by Howard
Ahmanson, a member of the Council For National Policy, a right-wing steering
group stacked with Bush true believers. Ahmanson is also one of the bagmen
behind the extremist Christian Reconstruction Movement, which advocates the
theocratic takeover of American democracy." Sequoia is owned by a partner
member of the Carlyle Group, which is believed to have dictated foreign
policy in both Bush administrations and has employed former President Bush
for quite a while.

All early Tuesday indicators predicted a Kerry landslide. Zogby
International (which predicted the 2000 outcome more accurately than any
national pollster) did exit polling which predicted a 100-electoral vote
triumph for Kerry. He saw Kerry winning crucial Ohio by 4 percent.

Princeton professor Sam Wang, whose meta-analysis had shown the election to
be close in the week before the election, began coming up with dramatic
numbers for Kerry in the day before and day of the election. At noon EST on
Monday, Nov. 1, he predicted a Kerry win by a 108-vote margin.

In the Iowa Electronic Markets, where "investors" put their money where
their mouths are and wager real moolah on election outcome "contracts,"
Bush led consistently for months before the election -- often by as much as
60 percent to 39 percent. But at 7 p.m. CST on Nov. 2, 76.6 percent of the
last hour's traders had gone to Kerry, with only 20.1 percent plunking their
bucks down on Bush. They knew something.

As the first election returns came in, broadcasters were shocked to see that
seemingly safe Bush states like Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina were
being judged as "too close to call." At 7:28 EST, networks broadcast that
both states favored Kerry by 51 percent to 49 percent.

In his research paper, Steven Freeman reports that exit polls showed Kerry
had been elected. He was leading in nearly every battleground state, in many
cases by sizable margins. But later, in 10 of 11 battleground states, the
tallied margins differed from the predicted margins -- and in every one the
shift favored Bush.

In 10 states where there were verifiable paper trails -- or no electronic
machines -- the final results hardly differed from the initial exit polls.
In non-paper-trail states, however, there were significant differences.
Florida saw a shift from Kerry up by 1 percent in the exit polls to Bush up
by 5 percent at close of voting. In Ohio, Kerry went from up 3 percent to
down 3 percent. Exit polls also had Kerry winning the national popular vote
by 3 percent.

In close Senate races, changes between the exit poll results and the final
tallies cost Democrats anticipated seats in Kentucky (a 13 percent swing to
the GOP), Alaska, North Carolina, Florida, Oklahoma, South Dakota and
possibly Pennsylvania -- as well as enough House seats to retake control of
the chamber.

Centre for Research on Globalization's Michael Keefer states, "The National
Election Pool's own data -- as transmitted by CNN on the evening of November
2 and the morning of November 3 -- suggest very strongly that the results of
the exit polls were themselves fiddled late on November 2 in order to make
their numbers conform with the tabulated vote tallies."

How do we know the fix was in? Keefer says the total number of respondents
at 9 p.m. was well over 13,000 and at 1:36 a.m. it had risen less than 3
percent -- to 13,531 total respondents. Given the small increase in
respondents, this 5 percent swing to Bush is mathematically impossible. In
Florida, at 8:40 p.m., exit polls showed a near dead heat but the final exit
poll update at 1:01 a.m. gave Bush a 4 percent lead.
This swing was mathematically impossible, because there were only 16 more
respondents in the final tally than in the earlier one.

FLORIDA FIASCO II

Kathy Dopp's eye-opening examination of Florida's county-by-county record of
votes cast and people registered by party affiliation
(http://ustogether.org/Florida_Election.htm) suggests systematic and
widespread election fraud in 47 of the state's 67 counties. This did not
occur so much in the touch-screen counties, where public scrutiny would
naturally be focused, but in counties where optically screened paper ballots
were fed into a central tabulator PC, which is highly vulnerable to hacking.
In these optical-scan counties, had GOP registrants voted Republican,
Democratic registrants gone for Kerry and everyone registered showed up to
vote, Bush would have received 1,337,242 votes.
Instead, his reported vote total there was 1,950,213! That discrepancy
(612,971) is nearly double Bush's winning margin in the state (380,952).

Colin Shea of Zogby International analyzed and double-checked Dopp's figures
and confirmed that optical-scan counties gave Bush 16 percent more votes
than he should have gotten. "This 16 percent would not be strange if it were
spread across counties more or less evenly," Shea explains, but it is not.
In 11 different counties, the "actual" Bush tallies were 50-100 percent
higher than expected. In one county, where
88 percent of voters are registered Democrats, Bush got nearly two- thirds
of the vote -- three times more than predicted by his statistical model.

In 47 Florida counties, the number of presidential votes exceeded the number
of registered voters. Palm Beach County recorded 90,774 more votes than
voters and Miami-Dade had 51,979 more, while relatively honest Orange County
had only 1,648 more votes than voters. Overall, Florida reported 237,522
more presidential votes (7.59 million) than citizens who turned out to cast
ballots (7.35 million).

There were thousands of complaints about Florida voting. Broward County
electronic voting machines counted up to 32,500 and then started counting
backward. This glitch, which existed in the 2002 election but was never
fixed, overturned the exit-poll-predicted results of a gambling referendum.
In several Florida counties, early-morning voters reported ballot boxes that
already had an unusually large quantity of ballots in them. In Florida and
five other states, according to Canada's Globe and Mail, "the wrong
candidate appeared on their touch-screen machine's checkout screen" after
the person had voted.

Republicans have argued that the Florida counties with majority Democratic
registration that voted overwhelmingly for Bush were all conservative
"Dixiecrat" bastions in northern Florida, and that all the reported totals
were accurate. But Olbermann demonstrated that many of these crossover
states voted Republican for the first time. He poked another hole in the
Dixiecrat theory when he noted that in Democratic counties where Bush scored
big, people also supported highly Democratic measures -- such as raising the
state minimum wage $1 above the federal level.

Moreover, 18 switchover counties were not in the Panhandle or near the
Georgia border, but were scattered throughout the state. For instance,
Hardee County (between Bradenton and Sebring) registered 63.8 percent
Democratic but officially gave Bush 135 percent more votes than Kerry.

WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS

Voters Unite! detailed 303 specific election problems, including 84
complaints of machine malfunctions in 22 states, 24 cases of registration
fraud in 14 states, 20 abusive voter challenge situations in 10 states, U.S.
voters in 18 states and Israel experiencing absentee ballot difficulties, 10
states with provisional ballot woes, 22 cases of malfeasance in 13 states,
10 charges of voter intimidation in seven states, seven states where votes
were suppressed, seven states witnessing outbreaks of animosity at the
polls, six states suffering from ballot printing errors and seven instances
in four states where votes were changed on-screen. In addition, the Voters
Unite! website cites four states with early voting troubles, three states
undergoing ballot programming errors, three states demonstrating ballot
secrecy violations, bogus ballot fraud in New Mexico and double-voting for
Bush in Texas.

Kerry's victory was predicted by previously extremely accurate Harris and
Zogby exit polls, by the formerly infallible 50 percent rule (an incumbent
with less than 50 percent in the exit polls always loses; Bush had 47
percent -- requiring him to capture an improbable 80 percent of the
undecideds to win) and by the Incumbent Rule (undecideds break for the
challenger, as exit polls showed they did by a large margin this time).

Nor is it credible that the surge in new young voters (who were witnessed
standing in lines for hours, on campuses nationwide) miraculously didn't
appear in the final totals; that Kerry did worse than Gore against an
opponent who lost support; and that exit polls were highly accurate wherever
there was a paper trail and grossly underestimated Bush's appeal wherever
there was no such guarantee of accurate recounts. Statisticians point out
that Bush beat 99 to 1 mathematical odds in winning the election.

Election results are not final until electors vote on Dec. 12. There is
still time to find the truth.

Ken Sherwood:

Why would writing "WPA research essays on American
crafts" be an example of "lousy" work for a poet?
Sounds inviting to me--can I comandeer (sp.?) a Time
Machine and go back to the thirties and sign up for
the job?  Does anyone else feel this way? What would
be a better job, if a poet has to have one, and mostly
we do?  Craft activities can be considered
intriguingly similar and different to what one is
doing as a poet or other "fine artist", so one would
be learning a lot from studying them--and also
learning about the sociology of one's country.  What
would be better--being an academic and dealing with a
blizzard of student papers, many of them from people
who don't care about the subject matter?  I wonder how
Zukofsky would compare his WPA days and his later
"better" employment as an academic?

(Better get back to the Civil Service grind--and stay
focused till 5:00 P.M. :(

There is a well-known, often-quoted sentence I'm trying to track down.
(Not entirely well-enough known to me, nor often enough quoted.)
I recall it's by a French writer, possibly symbolist poet(? -- no,
I think novelist) . . .

My recollection is, it runs something like this:
<< The world was made [the world exists?] for the purpose of being put [by
me?] into a book. >>

If somebody can point me to correct quotation / source / etc.,
I'd be obliged.

merci,
d.i.

This has nothing to do with the quote you are asking
about, but I thought of two lovely and supposedly not
contradictory quotes by yoga teacher T. K. V.
Desikachar:

"The world exists to be seen and experienced."

"The world exists to set you free."

Of course the space in which those quotes are not
contradictory is the "practice room".

Sorry yeah basically this has nothing to do with your
post. Oh well.

Mark:

It's weird, though. I was watching 60 Minutes last night, the story of the
child prodigy composer to whom the music just comes, music being
commissioned for him to write, and I think he's about eight years old! Of
course he's a prodigy, and so doesn't fit the mold. But I think it's some of
both. You need life experience, lots of it and as varied as possible, in
order to have something worth saying, and you must also have a line open to
your Muse, the Mystery from where the creative impulse comes. As for this
kid, for some unknown magic of the human brain, he's tapped into something
much larger than himself, something we poets also have the privilege of
glimpsing when we're writing well and beyond ourselves.

Music is essentially a mathematical construct and as such is inherently
different from poetry. Tho of course there have been (a very few) very
great young poets--not as young as this kid. My guess is that that's not as
likely to happen now because of our changed expectations of poetry.

Timken Lecture Hall, CCA SF Campus

philosophical reflections, humor, and curiosity about all facets of life.
Richard Foreman writes that Toufic "documents the moves of consciousness in a
way that leads the reader ever deeper, from impasse to illusion to new
impasse--turning the trap of 'what can't be named' into a true paradise."
Toufic's videos and mixed media works have been presented worldwide, and
include Phantom Beirut: A Tribute to Ghassan Salhab, 2002; Saving Face, 2003;
and The Sleep of Reason: This Blood Spilled in My Veins, 2002. His books

Music is a mathematical construct PLUS a lot more.
W.A. Mozart GREW UP to write music of lasting
significance AFTER the miracle of his childhood
musical facility.

Hopefully so will this childhood prodigy after his 60
Minutes fame.  I suspect his music is not all that
earth-shaking YET.

That sounds like Mallarme, from Quant au Livre (About the Book): "A
proposition which emanates from myself ... affirms, in short, that
everything in the world exists in order to end up as a book." (Michael
Gibbs' version)

STEVE TOMASULA READS AT EXHIBIT X

On Thursday December 2, fiction writer Steve Tomasula will be the second guest of the 2004-2005 season of the Exhibit X Fiction series. Tomasula will read a selection from his recent fiction, as well as answer audience questions about his on-going projects. All Exhibit X readings are free and open to the public.

Time:
7:00pm

Place:
The reading will be held ½ block from Hallwalls’ new location at:
Trinity Episcopal Church, The Chapel, 371 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo

Steve Tomasula's short fiction has appeared widely and most recently in McSweeney's, Fiction International, and The Iowa Review where he received the Iowa Prize for the most distinguished work published in any genre. His essays on body art and culture appear in Leonardo (M.I.T. Press) and other magazines both here and in Europe. He is the author of the novels IN & OZ (Ministry of Whimsy Press, 2003) and VAS: An Opera in Flatland (Station Hill, 2003 and University of Chicago Press, 2004). Tomasula teaches at the University of Notre Dame.

Reviews of Tomasula’s works:
Steve Tomasula's extraordinary "novel" –-or is it a film script? collage art work? philosophical meditation? –-tracks the story of a "simple" event in the life of a 21st century family. But "story" is the wrong word here, for Tomasula's dissection of post-biological life is about the new interaction of bodies and DNA possibilities. Tomasula's imagination, his satiric edge, his wildly comic sense of things, combined with Farrell's inventive page lay-out make reading this "Opera in Flatland" an unforgettable experience.
-Marjorie Perloff

A breathtaking inquiry into the artifacts of the human imagination, VAS: An Opera in Flatland is sensuous, ferocious, and original.
-Rikki Ducornet

This novel constitutes a leap forward for the genre we call 'novel.' Collapsing nonfiction into fiction, women's reproductive concerns into men's, history into present, work into play—this novel takes juxtaposition and digression to new heights.
-American Book Review

About Exhibit X:
As a series, Exhibit X hopes to distinguish itself among the rich body of reading series in Buffalo by showcasing writers of innovative and experimental fictions: authors who are not only writing cutting edge stories, but for whom an inquiry into the immediate situation of narrative, of what the genre "fiction" can be (and become) in a publishing market saturated by familiar forms, represents an on-going investigation. All readings take place off-campus at Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center (www.hallwalls.org) so that students, faculty, and the community can take advantage of a unique opportunity to meet invited writers. The Exhibit X website—which will begin offering streaming audio of each event this Fall—can be found at http://www.english.buffalo.edu/exhibitx/. Exhibit X is sponsored by the English Department and the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Buffalo. For more information about the series, contact Christina Milletti at milletti@buffalo.edu.

Our Spring Events:
Lydia Davis: TBA
Kathryn Davis: March 28

Yeah, you're right, not with poets, not that young, and music is different.
So we return to the need for experience. However--I don't know too much
about music, as I'm more visually oriented--can classical music be written
without experience? After all, adults are playing this. I know that you need
life experience to write Jazz, or the Blues. Is classical music so
different?

Of course. But rather misses my limited point. There are not likely to be
any eight year old poetry prodigies.

Yes, I think you have the two-sidedness of the question right. I dont
think,
for example, that Niedecker's poetry would be any less interesting if
she
had had a high-class job as a social worker or therapist.

this argument about experience and its relation to poetry begins to
sound not a little reductive...

look, one's poetry, one's view of one's poetry, one's view of one's
poetry in relation to one's life, which of course has all to do with
one's poetry:  all of these at some point connect with one's
experience...

to suggest that experience has nothing to do with one's art (or job)
is nonsense... to suggest that experience dictates---or
overdetermines---the final form of art (if you'll permit me this wee
aristotelian incursion) is also nonsense...

apologies for my seeming impatience about this stuff... but to speak
in formal terms of "poetry" as though it exists independently of the
circumstances out of which it springs just strikes me as the most
reductively formalist approach possible... at the same time, to draw
a straight line (as it were) from the art form to some specific
experiential matrix might not be the best way to go about
comprehending said art form...

SHEESH

Thanks y'all for the several pointers;
glad to (re)learn it's Mallarme's.

for what worth:  I've been trying various restatements
of it.  Here's one such effort:

|  Thus affirms an apothegm that began with me
|  all in the world exists for to end on a DVD


I don't know how "proposition" in French compares
with the same word in English; I assume they're quite
close in sense.  The above is slightly forced, yet
not far from the conceipt I've had in mind.

"for to end" is awkward (albeit oldenly ideomatic).
Apothegm is even more archaic perhaps; but the rhyming
instinct will out.

I've scrawled a dozen or more versions of this couplet,
and might perhaps end with this one.  I'm ignoring the text
covered (by J.Bradshaw) by an elipsis . . . ah well.

thanks again --
d.i.

That sounds like Mallarme, from Quant au Livre (About the Book): "A
proposition which emanates from myself ... affirms, in short, that
everything in the world exists in order to end up as a book." (Michael
Gibbs' version)

this argument about experience and its relation to poetry begins to
sound not a little reductive...

look, one's poetry, one's view of one's poetry, one's view of one's
poetry in relation to one's life, which of course has all to do with
one's poetry:  all of these at some point connect with one's
experience...

to suggest that experience has nothing to do with one's art (or job)
is nonsense... to suggest that experience dictates---or
overdetermines---the final form of art (if you'll permit me this wee
aristotelian incursion) is also nonsense...

apologies for my seeming impatience about this stuff... but to speak
in formal terms of "poetry" as though it exists independently of the
circumstances out of which it springs just strikes me as the most
reductively formalist approach possible... at the same time, to draw
a straight line (as it were) from the art form to some specific
experiential matrix might not be the best way to go about
comprehending said art form...

SHEESH

I keep thinking of an opposite view from the Mallarme, particularly the way
in which evangelicals - of any intractable persuasion - want the world and
you to mirror The Bible, The Koran, etc. and you be damned to hell if you
don't.

Buried in a beginning, the poem
starts with every line

                      there are 1,000 names of midnight
         or rather there are as many movements

as if that word was in all those directions
                 Crazy moon
breathing a sigh of each turning night dances full
a dream of ecstasy released in meditation
that comes down like rain & rises & falls about an orbit
eyes closed upon a rhythm pulsating

how the dance raptures a life of longing
sheathed in passion       echoes through the midnight fog

& then there is this one
this one is aloud without saying a word
here I wanders the path away from myself
in the vastness of midnight’s movement

1 million gestures without rest
stirring through the hours
a sill, waters breath up & down an orbit
to this night a lover
chants the cutting symbol
which opens the shadow of an oak tree

what is that? She points at the breaks in its trunk. That’s a vagina
& that is her arched back
turns over the dance of shades

Poetry is now so popular that British universities face a
supply-and-demand dilemma. So many students want to sign up for poetry
classes that there are not enough professional poets to teach them.

Apologies for cross-posting

On Friday 26 February 1999, Alaric Sumner delivered a paper - =
_Straddling L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE and Performance Writing: two =
women writing in Britain - Carlyle Reedy and Caroline Bergvall_ in a =
panel called _"Transgressive Prediscoveries": Women Writing L A N G U A =

Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky from 25-27 February 1999

As far as I know the paper was never published; and I do not have a full =
text. It is related to a talk he gave on Carlyle Reedy at a SVP =
Colloquium in London; and another on Reedy and dsh given at University =
of Westminster (and later printed in HJEAS Vol 5 #2); but it is not the =
same. And while I have a late draft of what he said of Reedy, it is the =
writing on Bergvall which is still missing

The host university does not have a copy. The chair of the panel does =
not have one.

I wonder if anyone reading this does, or can throw any light on the =
matter.

Please get in touch if you can.

Yesterday I did see "Burn". It's a terrific movie about the manipulation of
power among colonizers and slaves (and revolts) in the Caribbean in 1842.
Marlon Brando plays the English quo agent quo God father on an island in th=
e
Antilles in a film made by the same director of the Battle of Algiers. Of
course, the economics and behavior of white settlers was contemporary to al=
l
of the Americas (cooperate or genocide), as well as to the contemporary
moment in Iraq and other "opportunity zones". Cheney our current image of
the enforcer. It's a definitely film that is as resonant and disturbing
today as when it was made in the early seventies. The obliteration of
Fallujeh and the obliteration of rebel slave hideouts in the Antilles is wa=
y
too close for any comfort -  and all quite correspondent with this grievous
and disturbing account of Fallujeh and Bagdad in today's B Burning:

=A0
Tired in Baghdad...
The situation in Falloojeh is worse than anyone can possibly describe. It
has turned into one of those cities you see in your darkest nightmares-
broken streets strewn with corpses, crumbling houses and fallen mosques...
The worst part is that for the last couple of weeks we've been hearing abou=
t
the use of chemical weapons inside Falloojeh by the Americans. Today we
heard that the delegation from the Iraqi Ministry of Health isn't being
allowed into the city, for some reason.
I don't know about the chemical weapons. It's not that I think the American
military is above the use of chemical weapons, it's just that I keep
wondering if they'd be crazy enough to do it. I keep having flashbacks of
that video they showed on tv, the mosque and all the corpses. There was one
brief video that showed the same mosque a day before, strewn with many of
the same bodies- but some of them were alive. In that video, there's this
old man leaning against the wall and there was blood running out of his
eyes- almost like he was crying tears of blood. What 'conventional' weaponr=
y
makes the eyes bleed? They say that a morgue in Baghdad has received the
corpses of citizens in Falloojeh who have died under seemingly mysterious
conditions.=20
The wounded in Falloojeh aren't getting treatment and today we heard about =
a
family with six children being bombed in the city. It's difficult to believ=
e
that in this day and age, when people are blogging, emailing and
communicating at the speed of light, a whole city is being destroyed and
genocide is being committed- and the whole world is aware and silent.
Darfur, Americans? Take a look at what you've done in Falloojeh.
The situation in Baghdad isn't a lot better. Electricity has been
particularly bad. Our telephone has been cut off for the last week which ha=
s
made communication (and blogging) particularly difficult. The phone
difficulties are quite common all over Baghdad. It usually happens in an
area after a fresh bombing. We joke amongst ourselves that it's all an
agreement with the new mobile phone companies, but the truth is that the
mobile phones aren't very much more reliable. For the last couple of weeks
we've been able to receive sms from abroad (which was impossible before).
It's nice to get a message every once in a while from some concerned
relative or friend living far away, especially when the phone starts glowin=
g
eerily in the darkened living room.
We spent the last week fixing up the house. Around 10 days ago, there were =
a
series of very large explosions in our area and the third or fourth one too=
k
out three of the windows on one side of the house. Riverbend and family
spent two days gathering shattered glass and sticking sheets of plastic ove=
r
the gaping squares that were once windows. We sent E. for the window guy bu=
t
he was booked for three days. Our window man has become a virtual
millionaire with an average of about 20 windows to replace daily.
The situation is really bad in Baghdad. Many areas have turned into
mini-warzones. A'miriyah, A'adhamiyah, Ghazaliyah and Haifa to name a few.
The rest of us just get our usual dose of daily explosions and gun fire.
Elections are a mystery. No one knows if they'll actually take place and it
feels like many people don't want to have anything to do with them. They
aren't going to be legitimate any way. The only political parties
participating in them are the same ones who made up the Governing Council
several months ago- Allawi's group, Chalabi's group, SCIRI, Da'awa and some
others. Allawi, in spite of all his posturing and posing, has turned himsel=
f
into a hateful figure after what happened in Falloojeh. As long as he is in
a position of power, America will be occupying Iraq. People realize that
now. He's Bush's boy. He has proved that time and again and people are tire=
d
of waiting for something insightful or original to come from his government=
.
The weather is cool now. You can't leave the house without a jacket. Baghda=
d
is popular for a dry, windy cold. The kind that settles in late, but once
it's here, it seems to creep into everything, including one's bones. The
kerosene heater has become my cherished friend these last couple of weeks.
The days are much shorter and it gets a bit depressing when the darkness
sets in- especially when there's no electricity. We aren't using the
generator as much as before because there's still a fuel shortage.
There's a collective exhaustion that seems to have settled on Baghdad... it
feels almost like an epidemic sometimes.

Apparently Ron Paul, as Texas senator, attempted to add 'parental
consent language' to a bill that
just passed (Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Act for FY
2005)...this was not included
in the final bill. What I can't seem to find is much information about
what is going on with this...

It's my understanding that this new law allows 'outside stakeholders'
to supervise 'mental
tests' of school-aged children without parental consent. I know
Illinois has passed this legislation
and I believe yesterday it was passed nationally. The overarching goal
is to establish a permanent
electronic mental health record for all Americans so health insurers
etc will have access.

So, whatever the gov't deems unhealthy will be eradicated with
pills--with drug companies like Eli
Lilly making even more money to support the neo-cons, of course

All I can find right now is this conservative web site (of all places!)
... these Constitutionalists
see this of course as a huge Draconian measure (so do I) ... if anyone
can dig up anything on
this new scary measure let me know ... oh, it was mentioned on Daily
Kos as well ...
so both sides of the aisle see this as Orwellian.

Subject:      Rod Smith this Friday in MA
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

So a little birdie said to me that Rod Smith will be reading this Friday at
Amherst Books in Amherst MA. The birdie didn't tell me the time, but I think
it might be at 8pm, which would be nice, as I get off work from a different
bookstore, located across the river in Northampton, at around 6pm, enough
time to have dinner and head over to the reading. Of course, I could be
wrong--it might start at 7pm, in which case I'll have to go with something
quick. Anyhow, the point is: if you live near Amherst MA (1:45 hrs from
Boston; 2 hrs from Providence; 1 hr from Wesleyan or Yale Univ; 3 hrs [to 7
hrs-- depending on traffic ] from NYC; etc.) you should come.

From what the birdie says Rod's going to do two sets: one of which might be
"The Good House" in it's entirety. See, you really should come! A few years
ago I did a micro review of that poem which I'll paste here:

Regarding the composition of Tender Buttons, Gertrude Stein noted “I began
to discover the names of things, that is not discover the names but discover
the things the things to see the things to look at and in so doing I had of
course to name them. . . .” This process of circling around the essence of a
noun in order to enliven it sets the foundation for The Good House, Smith’s
latest chapbook-length poem. The sixth beautifully produced title from
Spectacular Books, The Good House is an investigation not only of the
concepts of house, home, and domesticity (“Any sung house requires /
calligraphy, camp, & / curtains—all too cute yes / yet one tires of burnt /
toys, dry fetishes, dead / humor, & clocks.”) but also of the language in
which such concepts are rooted. Welcomely, Smith animates much of the
tiresome postmodern/linguistic debates of the last few decades with his
wacky sense of humor, as when he asserts that “the house seems / to be a
verb though it dislikes / the term ‘housing’.” Smith’s exploration of the
way in which a house is at once in constant flux (“sometimes house,
sometimes home”) and complete stasis (“That it is a house. / That it never
moves. / That it loses concentration.”) might read simply as an analogy for
poetry, but he is careful to defuse such an easy out: “If the house is just
poetry / we’re in trouble.” As Lorca knew, “very often intellect is poetry’s
enemy,” and Smith, through his syntactical play and the twisting,
elongation, or complication of phrasings, moves one just beyond an overall
intellectual comprehension of his work and toward the more rewarding sphere
of intuitive knowledge, where “anything can be made out of a house.”

Nick,
The meaning for me was obvious: if you haven't made it, you're still a =
virgin, still masturbating...still writing only for yourself, not =
writing for nor with your audience, who ever the hell that may be.=20

I remember that comment, (or at least a similar one), but damned if I =
can recall whom to thank for having made the point) and I remember =
feeling angry at the time I read it, because I was then 45 or so.  And =
of course it is possible the person from whom I read the point =
plagiarized the comment.=20

And, at the time, I also remember thinking, "what exactly is, 'making' =
it?" =20

I've still not answered that question.

  I was disturbed to learn that a well-known
  critic of innovative poetry has been quoted
  as pointing out that if "You do not make it as a poet by
  your 40's you will not make it at all."

  What might this critic have meant by that?

yes  emphatically yes  music painting  poetry  all can be written without
experience
if you mean  life experience   training too in  some  cases  or i.e. the
self-taught artist
outsider artist  art brut(e) and poetry  certainly is mathematical
ask  ted enslin  who writes his like music  he is a trained  classical
musician/composer who studied w/boulanger (  i'll never spell that one
write)

and what are iambs ( no not i ams) /

any way  all art can be made without  experience  most of it today is
and i suspect a great deal in the past as well  especially due to the
fact  that  many of us start very young
so what does this art lack?  well EXPERIENCE of course  whatever that is.
some of us grow older  no wiser  and  never experience much of anything
some of us experience too much  when young  and filter it wrong  so never
get to absorb it or create
thru that/ those  experiences   and what again do we mean by experience /

/?

loss
travel
drugs
insanity
love
hate
pets
illness
job

as metaphor   ?????


you don't need life experience to write or play  jazz blues or classicall
 you just have to master the basic languages(  Tho experience  will
hopefully sure add depth)

i remember wynton ( the over-rated technician ) MarsaLIS once saying in
an interview  when asked about playing the blues that it's just like
acting ( implying that you can play a role ) same therefore applies to
writing the stuff inclluding most of the soul-less poetry of now and
probably tthen too if you can write a 12 bar blues it'll sound like a 12
bar blues  just like a sestina  or sonnett or concerto or fugue  ...
believe me those youngins and lots of  old folk too do NOT write FROM
experience but from  knowledge of the craft...

I took it that George was arguing against determinist ideas about poetry and
other occupations, rather than a totally aestheticised position.  An
interesting job does not make a person interesting, the lack of a job does
not ensure poetic integrity or an "authentic" life (whatever that is).
Textures of one's quotidian life may feed into a poem - equally, they may
not - and the idea that one may be determined by the other seems as
ridiculous to me as George says it does to him.  I reckon human beings, and
poetry, are much more complicated than such statements claim.

One may, for example, may be a broad mind in a narrow life.  One may live a
most interesting life and yet write extraordinarily dully.  &c.  And to note
this is not the same as saying that art and life have nothing to do with
each other.

Best

A

lack of caring crashing the body against itself repeatedly as below.

the song of the little boys and little girls against the abstracted
backdrop of transformed feedback continents pulsing and en-tranced.

I rread a book on Zen Buddhism with quotes and anecdotes - and the stories
and conundra were fascinating - but stilll, when I ponder (meaning of) the
Universe and everything ( I know -it's 42), have the voice saying - but say
there is nothing? Nothing at all - the poet/thinker in me - the
"spiritual-emotional - whatever it is" in me cant accept a complete
atheistic response to life; but the"l;ogical" opartof me says or cautions
"maybe there is nothing" ..so the world exists for  - for no reason could be
more truthful -

I cant accept official religion or doctrine really of any kind and yet -
deep down (I feel) theer has to be something) (*my son says he know there is
a god - and that god has spoken ot him - I cant argue with that - my problem
with it is the old problem of how do we know what we know and so on:)

I doesnt matter if you go off on a tangent when someone asks a question - I
do all the time!  Ideas generate ideas - its easy to sit and sneer but takes
courage to suggest ideas - or put a poem up on here.

I notice G Bowering just acerbated of someone's poem or what ever:  "Is this
suposed to be creative or something?"  well - let's realise we all have
views ideas approaches etc on here - the implication is that it is bad  (and
George B KNOWS - "I can tell you as I am ( probably has some recognition of
some sort -so what!)..." or he is  whatever he is (undoubtledly a worthy
poet but who'se to say?) - who is to say what is good or bad poetry - those
poets sitting in the wings who have reputatons of being good or have awards
etc? And fire in acidic attacks from time to time? Demonstrating their wit
(or witlesness?) and profundity by saying litle except something that sounds
it was made for a cryptic crossword or making an attack on a contributer??
Crosswords in fact...

Easy to criticise but harder (and more praiseworthy I feel) to have the
courage to contribute or risk one's hand or voice.

I'm not sure music is mathematical - in a  sense all operations of the mind
etc that have logical or other kinds of sequences etc are "mathematical" -
the key to poetry is that it is of course based on the word  - the
experience of the word or language is primal -it begins when we hear our
mothers the first time and when we hear people talking - speech and language
are essential  music could be dispensed with - we don't want to of ours but
we don't need music - but we meed speech and poetry relates to speech and
language -however you define it and it is almost the thing that makes us
human - and when we 'work' -  in the medium of language (like the musicians)
we are I feel with Joe tapping into something larger than ourselves - though
exactly what it is I don't know (more than music - the human voice -the
language we use is powerful -its modulations far more intense than music can
ever be or any other art form) (sometimes I think that music destroys the
silence needed to think and listen to words or speak words in this world - I
go fro days and don't listen to music, but I must hear a voice or read some
words in a poem or a book (aloud as I often do - to myself))..as to age - I
think that was "more creative" as a teenager but I think I had even less
idea of what everything was about than I do now - still don't know very much
more than when I was 20 or so - my life experience at 56 I think  (but
memory plays tricks!) "powers" or informs my writing (when I do write) - if
one is healthy - within some limits  - creativity ranges across a wide age
spectrum - a young person's mind works better ( - the brain - mind seems to
be at its optimum from about 20 to 50 or so - but that must vary - we are
all unique) but an old person has life experience.... but it doesn't concern
me what other people think the thing is to do or write if one wants: I
haven't written much for while but I haven't written myself off!!

As well as music - in the last analysis - we can also do without critics who
talk about "making it" - critics are failed writers etc

I think an artists can create an abstract work without experience. Or, maybe
I should say, without a LOT of life experience. Marsalis was a trumpet
prodigy, as far as knowing the forms. Chris Hollyday, at 13, was a marvelous
technician in the Bird tradition. The abstract nature of music requires
knowledge of the form, not necessarily of life.

While music is a highly mathematical form, the free jazz idiom to me has
always contained a "literary" component. It doesn't unfold according to the
blues or popular song structures, but according to a composer's logic or the
collective logic of its improvisers. It doesn't unfold by the measure, but
by the mood of the musicians playing in the moment. To me, it can resemble a
free verse poem.

While it helps to feel the blues when you play them, Steve's right; all you
have to know is the form and a few blues scales to play a blues that will
satisfy the average listener's ear.

Experience can come out in your work, but not necessarily in a one-to-one
ratio. Working in the social services prepared me to write a steamy,
commercial blockbuster: ruthless powerful people making dubious political
deals, having tons of illicit sex, etc. But writing that kind of book
doesn't hold my interest, so the experience came out in a tangential parody
of the field when I wrote COMMERCIAL FICTION.

A note on working dull jobs: they free your mind to think in ways that more
demanding jobs don't. Cecil Taylor washed dishes for many years before
people supported his work. I think his music reflects the abstract thoughts
he might have had while working instead of the dirt he saw on the dishes.
But even that might be oversimplifying the situation.

My job may have been a "right job" as Joel describes it, not because it
gave me satisfaction but because it gave me the freedom I need to find time
to write on company time that a different job wouldn't have allowed.

Toccata Giocosa

                “The mechanism of poetry is the same
                 as that of hysterical phantasies.”
                             –Sigmund Freud

The caught coffeepot was flouted less often than
one might have imagined. Stem-chasers attract
more attention than your average progress report.

St. Bebop romped among the indebted corbels,
taking up the accordion, then, only when
some madcap Sicilian folk song came to mind.

The insistent rampage of the Baron’s jeep cried
out for immediate attention, even as we, as always,
might have continued to try figuring ourselves out.

Callous stitches of time saved ninety-nine percent
of us from further abuse, some said. Silly
playground children, shrugging off inheritances,

making do till sundown rang down the curtain.
Art itself spread out upon some table–ether-
ealized, as in some oft-heard Eliot reliquary.

<< Bill,

The other day you asked how many "serious" musicians received NEA grants.
The NEA has given grants to jazz musicians, some of whom take their
composing seriously. I'm not sure precisely what these jazz artists received
their NEA grants for, but here's a short and quick list:

Leroy Jenkins
George Lewis
Wadada Leo Smith (I think)
Thomas Chapin
Sheila Jordan

Jenkins, Lewis and Smith were affiliated with the AACM in Chicago early in
their careers. Chapin was involved in the Downtown Music scene, e.g. playing
at the old Knitting Factory. In any case, the jazz vanguard got some
institutional support.

Sheila Jordan has been around forever, it seems, but not in what I'd
consider the avant-garde..

As far as Rap, I don't listen to it often but I've heard a wide range of
quality. Rapping itself is a style that goes back a number of decades. The
musical underpinnings used in the 1970s turned it into a musical idiom. (At
this point I'll defer to those more knowledgeable about the subject.) When
I've heard rappers interviewed on radio, they sound every bit as serious
about their work as a jazz musician or poet.

Best,

Vernon >>

What is this?  Ha Ha!  I already dumped the "serious" adjective a while ago,
and explained myself.  Hey, I can take it.

By the way, I included jazz artists in a previous post.  I love jazz, and
it's damned serious MUSIC -- not lyrics, music.  I made the point that jazz
is
often musically innovative, and now relies quite a bit on government grants.
My
source for this is Wynton Marcalis himself.

And one can trace rap all the way back to talking blues and further, if one
has the time.  Not forgetting the jazz rappers of the 60s, of course.  We're
on
the same page, Vernon.

Best, Bill

<< I'm just looking through the accumulation of the last week or two of
the poetics list and the continuing discussion about NEA fellowships.
I've worked on selection panels for many different granting agencies,
public and private over the last 20 years, virtually all for grants
related to artists and/or organizations involved in performing arts,
particularly new music. I know about how NEA grants are administered
generally, though I certainly don't know ANY details about any
particular round of NEA writing fellowships.

I also am not saying that I think this is a flawless program. There
are many things wrong with how this system works, but nearly all of
these problematic issues have not previously been addressed on this
list because, apparently, few of the people posting on this issue
have known how the system works. While a few people who've written in
on this topic do seem to have some sense of what's going on with the
program, so much of the accumulated dialog is so completely
misinformed and shows such a high degree of ignorance of the
processes involved, that it's difficult to know where to start in
addressing the combined discussion of the last week or so. The short
answer is basically: there's no reason to believe that some external
agency is going to do what you want it to & you're not going to
change it without knowing why it does what it already does.

Reading the analyses of the list of fellowship recipients, as well as
the suggestions of individuals who should have been getting these
funds, raises a usually unexamined corollary to some of the ongoing
discussion: that this community of more than 1,000 e-mail readers
each hold differing opinions about what writers might be "innovative"
poets worthy of support.

Looking back on the forty years or so the agency has operated, the
NEA has NEVER made "innovation" in the arts a major priority for
support, either for organizations or individuals. Whatever
organizations or individual artists who received support from the NEA
in the past who work in any of the various "innovative" traditions of
art received the support based on other criteria entirely. The NEA
generally rewards quality and stability, judging both by entirely
subjective means based on information and materials submitted with
application forms.

More importantly: NEA fellowships are selected ENTIRELY from whatever
pool of writers who have chosen to apply for NEA fellowships in a
particular year. If a writer has NOT applied for a writing
fellowship, no matter how worthy for a grant they may be, that writer
can NOT and will NOT receive a fellowship. There is NO mysterious
jury picking writers they want to support based on what panel members
may have read in various publications. They look only at writers who
have applied for support.

I expect that a very, VERY HIGH proportion of the writers that
various posters to this list think should have received NEA writing
fellowships in recent years did not apply. Most people don't. In the
past when there were NEA fellowship programs for artists working in
many forms, and not just writing at best about 1 out of 20-25
applicants were awarded fellowships. Because of recent budget
considerations, it is very likely that the odds are now substantially
higher and I would not be surprised if only one out of forty or fifty
applicants were now awarded fellowships. There are a lot of writers
and there's not a lot of money. Looking at the range of poetry
available in a specialty store like, say, Open Books in Seattle or
Grolier in Boston, I'd guess that the proportion of "innovative"
poets to poets working in other styles is probably 1 out of ten or
twenty. To expect a program that is not set up to reward "innovation"
to provide fellowships for "innovative" writers in a significantly
greater proportion than this is simply not realistic. If the NEA gets
something like 4-500 applications, and gives out 20-30 fellowships
for there to be more than 1-2 "innovative writers AT THE MOST who
receive support in any given grant cycle is very very unlikely.

Applicants for NEA writing fellowships fill out a fairly simple form
and submit what they consider to be representative work samples. The
work samples are submitted without indication of who wrote them.
There are many things wrong with any system of blind submissions of
work samples. (People always cite instances in which the jury MUST
have known who supposedly "blind" applicants were and that has been
an actual problem in some cases. But I also know of more than one
instance in which a composer was cut during the first round of
consideration because jurors thought that the work samples submitted
were derivative of that very composer's work - in this case, the
staff of the granting organization brought the application forward
for re-consideration during subsequent non-blind stages of the
process because they weren't idiots.) All other grant and fellowship
programs are not judged blind. If blind judging is a problem for an
applicant for any reason, it makes sense to NOT apply for support
from agencies that use it in their adjudication process.

Members of the NEA panel (and, just as recipients are drawn from the
pool of applicants, it's possible for anyone: writer, critic, reader,
whatever; to submit a resume and ask to be considered as a panelist
for any NEA grant category) read the unidentified work samples,
ideally before meeting collectively, and make their own opinions
about the relative value of the works. When the panel meets, they
discuss these opinions and collectively rank them in some sort of
relative order. At some point during the process, the staff will
inform them of the amount of funds available for fellowships and they
make a tentative cut-off point on this ranked list. Members of these
panels rotate off after 2-3 years in a staggered schedule so that
each subsequent panel is not literally made up of the same jurors.

Let me also note here that many many artists working in all fields
and genres often have little or no understanding of how people
respond to their work or what it is that they respond positively to.
One of the most frustrating things about serving on grant review
panels is that so many work samples by artists are so crappy that NO
amount of discussion by a juror who knows and wants to support the
work can sway other jurors who haven't experienced other examples of
what they artists does. There are only so many ways that you can say
something like "no, really, this artist is a lot better than what
they've submitted for our consideration."

It is also likely that there is also some kind of consideration about
the geographic spread of the potential recipients of these
fellowships. Just as legislators are generally more supportive of
funding bills which include some money that goes to their own state
or congressional district, legislators are concerned about tax-based
programs that do not support artists from an array of locations
around the United States. I do not know for sure, and this kind of
consideration may NOT made by the jury itself, but it's possible that
some adjustments are made to the recipient list so that some of the
funding goes to writers who do not live in either New York State or
California where, for better or for worse, a very large proportion of
artists in the US live.

Now, about all the discussion about the relative level of support for
the non-literary arts in the United States and how this may have
influenced the development of the arts in the US. There are currently
absolutely NO NEA fellowship programs for painters, sculptors,
composers, choreographers, dramatists, film makers, or any creative
artists other than writers. ONLY writers can apply for fellowships
from the NEA. This has been true for about ten years now, and is very
very unlikely to change any time soon.

When the NEA did have fellowships in dance, music, visual arts, etc,
the proportion of "innovative" recipients relative to the number of
recipients working in, what, more staid forms (using the term
"traditional" as a distinction from something like "innovative" in
regard to the NEA is problematic because they have a program that
supports REALLY traditional folk arts like banjo pickers, Hmong
tapestry makers, etc) was not significantly different from that of
the proportion of "innovative" writers among fellowship recipients.

(There are currently two small award programs for which jazz
performers or folk/traditional artists who have had lengthy careers
[usually something like 40-50 years] can be nominated. They can't
literally apply and, in most cases the nominations are made by staff
members of organizations who present jazz or folk artists. There have
usually been only one or two awards in a given year to jazz masters
[though in the last round they gave out 4-6]. In the folk arts
category, there are something like 6-10 awards a year [but this
covers all traditional genres, including music, dance, crafts, etc].
These "master" artist awards are selected by peer panels which are,
for reasons that should be obvious, are NOT working with blind
submissions.

When you consider that fellowships do nothing more than buy some time
for creative artists to make work and in the performing arts when the
composition process is complete there's still no art work to look at
without rehearsals, and performances that cost far more than any
fellowship can support, the comparative support from the NEA for
individual creative artists has always been somewhat skewed IN FAVOR
of artists like writers. When a poet or novelist completes a
manuscript, the work is done.  Sure writers still need to find
publishers, but they have something that anyone who can read can see
in something very close to its finished form. This is quite literally
not the case for a composer, choreographer, playwright, etc. When
they have a score or script completed, they have nothing that they
can hand to someone outside of their field that can be experienced as
a fully realized artform.

Does any of this mean that if more "innovative" writers were to apply
for NEA fellowships there would necessarily be more innovative
writers who received support? No, though it'd probably make some kind
of difference if more people who were supportive of innovative
writing submitted resumes to be considered as NEA panelists.

Does any of this mean that any particular "innovative" writer who
applies for NEA fellowships regularly will eventually receive one? No.

Are writers worse off than other creative artists in terms of how
they are supported by the NEA? Actually, no.

Does the NEA reward "innovation" in any of the art forms it supports? No.

Is this system perfect? No. Can it be made better? Sure.

If you want to do something to try to make the NEA writers fellowship
program better, you've got to know how the agency really works and
you've got to know how to work with, within, and against bureaucratic
structures. Whining on the poetics list about what you wish would
happen instead of what does happen isn't going to change anything.

&, because of changes in the NEA's mission and operations after the
various attempts at shutting down the agency in the 1980s, many of
the changes people have mentioned could only be realized through
limitations added the federal legislation that authorizes the agency.
How many of y'all really think it would be worth spending the time
necessary to lobby Congress for the possibility of barely increasing
the number of "innovative" poets who get $20K from a tiny government
agency once every two years?

If you're leaning toward saying that you do indeed think this would
be time well spent, let me suggest you first think about all of the
other issues you might also want the US legislature to consider and
act on in the coming years. A few $20K fellowships are damn
unimportant in the overall scheme of what the current administration
does and does not seem likely to attempt in the next four years.

But hey, maybe that's just me.

Very entertaining post.  But don't we know all this?  People who don't enter
can't win?  I'll go out on a limb and assume that only the very slow think
they can earn a prize without entering the contest.  Even the dullest bulb in the
pack knows that in order to win the lottery, you gotta buy a ticket.  I'm
also fairly confident that most listserv members know the score, and are
acquainted with the info you provide.

I, for one, served as Associate Director for the Louisiana Endowment for the
Humanities, and I saw first hand how those panels worked.  I absolutely stand
by my remarks.  Anyone who believes that politics and cronyism are not
involved is just naive. (You admit that they occur, so you're not.)  Wow, were they
ever involved!  I was hoping the NEA was doing a better job, at least in
choosing poetry with a contemporary flavor.  Exempting the odd exception, it doesn't
seem so.  I say again that if submissions are blind, then this even spread
across the country, evinced by the 2003 winners, has about a million to one
chance of occurring.  What luck, right?  You grant that adjustments are made for
the sake of geopolitics.  What am I doing responding to you?  You're arguing my
case.

I currently serve as one of the judges for a yearly poetry award, handed out
by my English Department to the tune of $1000 plus tons of money in travel and
hotel expenses.  We get submissions from all over the planet, and have
"prized" some well established authors, and have dumped a lot of crap.  (I think
list members understand the process.)  And yes, despite my continuing
protestations, the award always goes to something conventionally non-threatening.  I'm
outvoted again and again.  No surprise here, but I admit to some frustration.
Most authors, academic or otherwise, do, after all, toe the line.  And since
the line moves ever so slowly, as opposed to the  more energetic (am I too
optimistic?) stomp of creativity, they often find themselves quickly out of date.
Worse, those judges I know/have known personally who consider themselves
members of an oppressed group almost always vote for a member of that group, no
matter the relative quality of the submission.  What a mess!

As for lobbying Congress -- wouldn't do much good with the current one, I
imagine.  Consider that the current boss of the NEA has made it clear that the
agency will fund nothing construed as obscene, or blasphemous, or politically
off center -- a recipe for a bland diet, and that's what the taxpayers are
eating.  Sure, there are lots of issues to think about, like world hunger and
Bush's brain, or lack of.  I'm pretty confident that listmembers can care about
more than one at a time.  I do love poetry.  It's a priority for me.  My bad?

Looking through your post, I can agree at least that if more imaginative
panelists were chosen, we'd get more imaginative winners.  That's part of the
point I've been making.  It may be true that there are only so many ways a panel
can say that an author's submission is not up to standards.  But how often does
that translate into "This is too 'different' for my taste?"  Panelists should
be looking for difference as a minimum requirement.  That, at least, is
something OBJECTIVE for them to hang their hats on.  Are they unaware of literary
history, what it preserves and what it eventually dumps, and the reasons for?
Why not the HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT LITERATURE as a model?  Yes, the canon is
flawed by sexist and racist attitudes -- but what IS there is still generally a
record of innovation, however incomplete.  Unlikely that history will
preserve 44 Robert Pinskys (thanks for the numbers info, Joe), unless Robert Pinsky
writes the history.  Ooohhh God!!!!!  If these panelists think they were
judging on the basis of merit, then I don't know what to say  --  except Ooohhhh
God!!!!!!

I don't think it's true that the NEA has never rewarded innovation in arts
other than poetry.  I may be wrong, but my impression is that it did so on a
fairly regular basis until Karen Finley and Co. caught the attention of the
Conservatives.  Performance art, as one example, was still a new item, so most of
the fellowships went to artists who were doing something contemporary,
something more or less inventive.  And there IS the very occasional award to
progressive poetry, to Ron Silliman (2003) who is hardly run of the mill, whether one
likes his method or not.

The Nobel, we know, is as mired in politics as is our Federal agency, perhaps
moreso.  Yet they manage to reward the innovative more often, even in the
area of literature.

What you consider whining is, to me, serious, well earned bitching.  Ha ha!
The target in this case is conformity.  Enough bitching and things change.
That's politics.

Whew!  I'm obviously having fun.  But for Deconstruction, I can't think of
another issue that has prompted as many posts from me.  Thanks everyone!

Best, Bill

But this throws abstraction into the perjorative, where it doesn't belong.
Could the Abstract Expressionists have accomplished what they did without
being in  midst of demanding experiences, of trying to survive the
Depression even while agonizing over their work? I don't think so. If
anything, abstraction demands more from the living gut.

I thought it was more than just "textures" feeding into one's
poetry/poetics. Recently, I read that for Wallace Stevens, poetry could
not be an information-carrying medium. Maybe this has to do with his
day-job, maybe it didn't but one could see how this was his day-job
effecting his poetry in quite a big way. At a guess, it could be that his
way of writing was a reaction *against* his job. I'm sympathetic to this
approach. My day-job is highly regulated by the distant authority known as
the compiler -  maybe my poetics is a reaction against this. But I think
this is only one clue amongst many and you could get overly determined in
short order if you weren't careful.

I also read somewhere that to be a writer, one had to have a dull life.
Was that Henry James? Maybe Ezra is the anti-thesis to this?

Isn't writing a poem like making a cake?

If writing a poem is seen as a series of choices, then each choice must be
informed by the context within which the choice is made. Experience, then,
becomes only one influence amongst many on the outcomes. The factors that
go to effect each outcome can be a mix - 2 oz flour,1 egg, 5 fl oz milk,1
tbsp butter - each part of the mix coming to bear as and when the poet
wishes -- or not. It doesn't stop the result being as flat as a pancake.
Or maybe that's what you wanted?

In many respects, this thread reminds me of nature v nurture debates.
Steve Jones side-stepped the argument by alikening the process to making a
cake.

I took it that George was arguing against determinist ideas about poetry
and
other occupations, rather than a totally aestheticised position.  An
interesting job does not make a person interesting, the lack of a job does
not ensure poetic integrity or an "authentic" life (whatever that is).
Textures of one's quotidian life may feed into a poem - equally, they may
not - and the idea that one may be determined by the other seems as
ridiculous to me as George says it does to him.  I reckon human beings,
and
poetry, are much more complicated than such statements claim.

One may, for example, may be a broad mind in a narrow life.  One may live
a
most interesting life and yet write extraordinarily dully.  &c.  And to
note
this is not the same as saying that art and life have nothing to do with
each other.

Bill,

I think I posted this a few days after you posted your update. I may have
missed your update that included jazz. This is just information I gathered.
No big deal. We're usually on the same page. I don't think anything has
changed in this exchange.

<< Bill,

The other day you asked how many "serious" musicians received NEA grants.
The NEA has given grants to jazz musicians, some of whom take their
composing seriously. I'm not sure precisely what these jazz artists received
their NEA grants for, but here's a short and quick list:

Leroy Jenkins
George Lewis
Wadada Leo Smith (I think)
Thomas Chapin
Sheila Jordan

Jenkins, Lewis and Smith were affiliated with the AACM in Chicago early in
their careers. Chapin was involved in the Downtown Music scene, e.g. playing
at the old Knitting Factory. In any case, the jazz vanguard got some
institutional support.

Sheila Jordan has been around forever, it seems, but not in what I'd
consider the avant-garde..

As far as Rap, I don't listen to it often but I've heard a wide range of
quality. Rapping itself is a style that goes back a number of decades. The
musical underpinnings used in the 1970s turned it into a musical idiom. (At
this point I'll defer to those more knowledgeable about the subject.) When
I've heard rappers interviewed on radio, they sound every bit as serious
about their work as a jazz musician or poet.

Best,

Vernon >>

What is this?  Ha Ha!  I already dumped the "serious" adjective a while ago,
and explained myself.  Hey, I can take it.

By the way, I included jazz artists in a previous post.  I love jazz, and
it's damned serious MUSIC -- not lyrics, music.  I made the point that jazz
is
often musically innovative, and now relies quite a bit on government grants.
My
source for this is Wynton Marcalis himself.

And one can trace rap all the way back to talking blues and further, if one
has the time.  Not forgetting the jazz rappers of the 60s, of course.  We're
on
the same page, Vernon.

has recently translated them into Finnish, and updated the code.
English, Finnish and, in some cases, Chinese translations are
available--Chinese translations by Dr. Shuen-shing Lee of Taiwan.
They all now run on both Mac and PC on most contemporary browsers
(rather than just on IE for the PC, which was formerly the case).
Many thanks to Marko Niemi of Helsinki/Turku for not only translating
but also updating the code of these poems, which is important to
any chance of this sort of work surviving. I did noitalsnart on
his Finnish translations, ie, copied them and translated them
back into English so as to have English versions as good as
Marko's Finnish code.

Thanks for this Derek. Interesting, good, bad?? If it leads to publishing
opportunities or not, it's great to have poetry rerecognized.
Poetry is now so popular that British universities face a supply-and-demand
dilemma. So many students want to sign up for poetry classes that there are not
enough professional poets to teach them.

"Poets and artists, especially in America, make me sick.  What right

design a beautiful motor car.

it's about the only thing I know how to do.  America doesn't want poems
badly enough to make it a profitable business to be engaged in."

Steve wrote:
..|  many of us start very young
..|  so what does this art lack?
..|  well EXPERIENCE of course

Another way to look at this Steve (for those specifically enrolled in
MFA programs and the like around the world): the biggest obstacle to
educated youth is their lack of INEXPERIENCE -- which they owe precisely
to their over-education; what I think you get at when you speak in terms
of errors with 'filters'.


..|  those youngins and lots of  old folk too
..|  do NOT write FROM experience but
..|  from  knowledge of the craft...

Yes, exactly. Lack of inexperience again. And who do we have to thank
for this 'crafting' of the art? When did 'knowledge of the craft' (a
quantity) replaced the craft itself? Who planted and endorsed this seed
of administrative-activity; this measuring-line mechanic?



Richard asked:
..|  who is to say what is
..|  good or bad poetry

I always think to answer questions like these with Spinoza since his
answers arrive via geometric proof (without quantity; non-empirical) and
cannot be faulted:

Spinoza's Proposition XXXI (from 'Ethics'):

In so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature, it is necessarily
good.

Proof: In so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature, it cannot be
bad for it. It will therefore necessarily be either good or indifferent.
If it be assumed that it be neither good nor bad, nothing will follow
from its nature (IV:Def.i.), which tends to the preservation of our
nature, that is (by the hypothesis), which tends to the preservation of
the thing itself; but this (III:vi.) is absurd; therefore, in so far as
a thing is in harmony with our nature, it is necessarily good. Q.E.D.
(spinoza means here that there is no indifference with harmony - derek)

Corollary: Hence it follows, that, in proportion as a thing is in
harmony with our nature, so is it more useful or better for us, and vice
versa, in proportion as a thing is more useful for us, so is it more in
harmony with our nature. For, in so far as it is not in harmony with our
nature, it will necessarily be different therefrom or contrary thereto.
If different, it can neither be good nor bad (IV:xxix.); if contrary, it
will be contrary to that which is in harmony with our nature, that is,
contrary to what is good - in short, bad. Nothing, therefore, can be
good, except in so far as it is in harmony with our nature; and hence a
thing is useful, in proportion as it is in harmony with our nature, and
vice versa. Q.E.D.


..|  those poets sitting in the wings
..|  who have reputations of being
..|  good or have awards etc?

It is to our discredit that most people feel inferior at the prospect of
being equal and feel compelled to construct reputations to secure their
fantasies. Ultimately something is 'good' because we choose to seek it
(see spinoza above), not for any other reason.

Awards, reputations, etc., are assembled in order to escape from
ourselves ('the thing itself'). Chiefly they operate as stand-ins
(quantities; pure fantasies) to defer and confuse consideration of the
particular in favor of ornamental wonder (hyperbole; useless additions).
Reputation is *attributed to* which is a source outside and foreign to
the person or object in question; it is tacked-on. Things are also
similarly 'awarded' and 'presented'. (It should not be hard for anyone
to understand my meaning here, even though the understanding itself may
be hard on the feelings; there isn't a living Firefly who would tolerate
being called an 'upstart'.) The greater point here should be that
reputations, awards, flag-waving, name-dropping etc. all exist and are
of a natural order in the course of things as they happen, but, error is
made when we, collectively or individually (maybe just individually
since there is no collective without the individual first) attribute
value to these attributions -- that is, when we *choose to validate*
absurdity or mere imperfect human opinion and remove our innate
good-sense in favor of extrinsic denomination.



Mickey lamented:
..|  I've lost my artistic confidence. I used
..|  to make terrific poems & now... I don't
..|  want to talk about it ... [any] remedies?

Even finding nothing is a discovery. I think you may have lost your
ornamentation -- whatever compelled you to convince yourself things were
terrific -- and now you appear to be in a more honest position.

Liberty has freed you from the restriction and control of the
condition/prison of 'terrific-ness'. You've just been paroled! What you
do now is your own *choice* -- and that is full of potential.

Just so. Reputation is what others think of you; contrast it with
"honor", which is what you think of yourself.

The similarities between music and poetry is a creation of rhythm. These
rhythms evoke an emotional response in us that is almost primal. Language
allows you to feed off of the emotions created by these rhythms.   Auden
said all poems written  by a poet must be believed by that poet to make his
work authentic. One of the reasons he edited his early works. While Bukowski
thought that everything he wrote was mindless drunken babble.
Somewhere you have to add in taste.
Do you love to read Hemingway or Hunter S. Thompson?
Can  you enjoy both?



&gt; I'm not sure music is mathematical - in a&nbsp; sense all operations of
the mind<BR>
&gt; etc that have logical or other kinds of sequences etc are
&quot;mathematical&quot; -<BR>
&gt; the key to poetry is that it is of course based on the word&nbsp; -
the<BR>
&gt; experience of the word or language is primal -it begins when we hear
our<BR>
&gt; mothers the first time and when we hear people talking - speech and
language<BR>
&gt; are essential&nbsp; music could be dispensed with - we don't want to of
ours but<BR>
&gt; we don't need music - but we meed speech and poetry relates to speech
and<BR>
&gt; language -however you define it and it is almost the thing that makes
us<BR>
&gt; human - and when we 'work' -&nbsp; in the medium of language (like the
musicians)<BR>
&gt; we are I feel with Joe tapping into something larger than ourselves -
though<BR>
&gt; exactly what it is I don't know (more than music - the human
voice -the<BR>
&gt; language we use is powerful -its modulations far more intense than
music can<BR>
&gt; ever be or any other art form) (sometimes I think that music destroys
the<BR>
&gt; silence needed to think and listen to words or speak words in this
world - I<BR>
&gt; go fro days and don't listen to music, but I must hear a voice or read
some<BR>
&gt; words in a poem or a book (aloud as I often do - to myself))..as to
age - I<BR>
&gt; think that was &quot;more creative&quot; as a teenager but I think I
had even less<BR>
&gt; idea of what everything was about than I do now - still don't know very
much<BR>
&gt; more than when I was 20 or so - my life experience at 56 I think&nbsp;
(but<BR>
&gt; memory plays tricks!) &quot;powers&quot; or informs my writing (when I
do write) - if<BR>
&gt; one is healthy - within some limits&nbsp; - creativity ranges across a
wide age<BR>
&gt; spectrum - a young person's mind works better ( - the brain - mind
seems to<BR>
&gt; be at its optimum from about 20 to 50 or so - but that must vary - we
are<BR>
&gt; all unique) but an old person has life experience.... but it doesn't
concern<BR>
&gt; me what other people think the thing is to do or write if one wants:
I<BR>
&gt; haven't written much for while but I haven't written myself off!!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; As well as music - in the last analysis - we can also do without
critics who<BR>
&gt; talk about &quot;making it&quot; - critics are failed writers etc<BR>

&gt; &gt; Music is essentially a mathematical construct and as such is

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You seem to be speaking from both sides of the issue,
which certainly<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;makes<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things more complex.&nbsp; My own part of this
discussion was more about<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; health of poetry than about the health of individual
poets. The<BR>
&gt; problem,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to me, is the similarity of experience that
the<BR>
&gt; institutionalization<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of poetry has led to. Let's for a moment imagine Milton
without his<BR>
&gt; day<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;job<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or in a parsonage like Herrick. He wrote some pretty
wonderful poetry<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before taking on his political role, but Lycidas, which
marks the<BR>
&gt; decision<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do so, is I think the best of the early work, and his
day job gave<BR>
&gt; us<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paradise Lost, among a great deal else the best
political poem in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; language. Tho the job kept him away from verse for a
decade.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Behind this discussion is I think another. I take George
Bowering's<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; statement that &quot;you effect poetry by writing it. It
is not effected by<BR>
&gt; a<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set of circumstances affecting your life&quot; as
expressing an extreme<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aestheticist position. Sure, you have to decide to write
it in order<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; write, a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. But
that's not<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole of it.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless a poem is just &quot;a machine made of
words&quot; (an aestheticist<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pronouncement by one of the most engaged of poets)
experience<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matters--having in whatever sense decided to write one
writes out of<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breadth of who we are, and that breadth (or narrowness)
of being is<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expressed in everything we write, regardless of
intention. Otherwise<BR>
&gt; we<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; risk being about as interesting as crossword puzzles,
which are also<BR>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Early in what became my first career (and is
unfortunately looking<BR>
&gt; like<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it will be my second career), I did look to poets
like Eliot (Pound<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;saved&quot; him from the bank / himself),
Williams, et.al.&nbsp; I did feel<BR>
&gt; that<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;by having a day job, I was broadening my
experience.&nbsp; Also, while<BR>
&gt; being<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a female technologist was a day in day out blow to
self confidence,<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paychecks were a nice counterbalance to what
sometimes feels like<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;constant utter writing failure.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The same argument (the experience is good for you,
makes you better,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more, etc.) is made for children as is made for
&quot;real jobs&quot;.&nbsp; That<BR>
&gt; you<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can never know what it is like to -- blah blah --
that are you really<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;human if you don't -- etc etc -- that you're not
participating in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;larger society -- and I think that got mentioned
here in a small way.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Maybe it should be mentioned in a big way.&nbsp; I
feel the societal and<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;familial pressure for a woman -- me, any woman -- to
have children,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;followed by the lack of value placed on mothers and
children in the<BR>
&gt; same<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;society -- is the same sort of pressure that bears
on poet / career,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;poet / artist, and artist / money situations.&nbsp;
Blatant and outrageous<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;misunderstanding of what it is to work and write is
everywhere.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't pretend I would be a poet who would visit a
shopping mall<BR>
&gt; like I<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would visit Mars.&nbsp; But -- why are sitcoms so
not funny?&nbsp; Why do most<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;broad comedies not elicit laughter (except for the
schtick?)? Why is<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Billy Collins&nbsp; dull? (though I do find the
Victoria Secret<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;discomfiting)?&nbsp; Many of these stories sell
something (via product<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;placement), but they also sell something by their
situation, through<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their story.&nbsp; So they are extraordinarily dull
if you're outside the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;situation / audience / market. While I'd love to
slag Jim Belushi,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sitcoms aren't funny because they're selling
stereotypes very<BR>
&gt; seriously.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And that is not funny.&nbsp; For the same reason, I
cringe whenever W<BR>
&gt; makes a<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;joke about making / not making his wife do public
speaking followed<BR>
&gt; by<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sure dry chuckle it elicits from his
audience.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I waste a lot of time worrying that my detailed
knowledge about<BR>
&gt; luxury<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;objects is evil.&nbsp; But I DO write a great deal
about them.&nbsp; I DO have<BR>
&gt; a<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nearly-book-length project having to do with
cooking... and the<BR>
&gt; fashion<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;designer poems in Da3 are a blend of criticism about
the designs and<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;writings / quotes from the designers.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;All best,<BR>

Hello all

Just a note to let you know that I'm planning on publishing a small mail-out
periodical called DIRECT POETICS

It's free but donations will not be turned down

No poetry, however, only essays, notes, reviews, etc presented in simple
format--photocopied sheets, staple-bound, half folded, and mailed out--

So if you'd like to submit, or join the mailing list, I set up an email
account at directpoetics@lycos.com or write me at 8630 Wardwell Rd,
Bainbridge Island, WA 98110

Hope all is well with you

Yrs, Drew
