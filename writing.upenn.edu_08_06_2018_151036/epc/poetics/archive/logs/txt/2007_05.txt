NOVA COOKIE & FROZEN HELL

Hemingway once wrote a story in just six words :

"For sale: baby shoes, never worn." and is said to have called it his
best work.

So I asked writers to take a shot themselves.
Very short stories. Six words !

Many headed monsters -- unless, of course, there's no such thing as
chance, in which case Brad - for all his age and sensitivity - was nothing
less than a time-bomb, ticking softly away until his appointed time; in
which case, we should either - optimistically - get up and cheer, because
if everything is planned in advance, then we all have a meaning, and are
spared the terror of knowing ourselves to be random, without a _why, or
else, of course, we might - as pessimists - give up right here and now,
understanding the futility of thought, decisions, action, since nothing we
think makes any difference anyway; things will be as they will. Where,
then, is optimism? In fate or in chaos? It was only a matter of time...

                                   I walk through a storm
 when everything is blue.
 A car furiously escapes, peeling
 mosquito shaves from grounded
 air.  And lightning shrivelling
 such aimless skies tonight.
 We’ll work through this together,
 but my feet cripple me later, by
 then all those houses stick to them.
 She started talking about
 ghosts and killings and shit.
 I guess you know what I mean;  colds
 arrange their fluent sheaves
 around us, as on Toledo  Road
 as on North Ridge, arresting walking
 sleep: this is a fuck of demon.
 They connect behind the
 Circle-K.  I’ll speak to you
 in lights, and kneel. You’ve never
 lost anything.  I win. Blue breath.

Vote Now to Impeach Cheney & Bush

     * The People's Email Network, Posted May 1, 2007
       Straight to the Source

VOTING ACTION PAGE: http://www.usalone.com/cheney_impeachment.php

Cast your vote and send your message to Congress at the same time!

As courageously drafted by Dennis Kucinich in H.Res. 333 filed just
last week, the first and most central ground stated for the
impeachment of Vice President Cheney was that he led the charge in
fabricating a case for invasion of Iraq, based on phony weapons of
mass destruction.  Now almost as if it were timed to coincide with
that initiative, former CIA head George Tenet reveals they knew their
evidence was flimsy, erroneous and just plain bogus all along, but
that Cheney just kept exaggerating the threat anyway. This is without
question the most momentous issue of our time, and whether you agree
that Cheney should be impeached, or not, your voice is needed to
speak out now, and tell Congress what they should do about it.

You can vote yes.  Or you can vote no.  But we cannot remain silent.

Of course, anyone who's been honestly and fairly paying attention has
known at least since the exposure of the Downing Street Minutes that
we were misled into the Iraq quagmire, by an executive branch that
could not be bothered with either the actual facts or a serious
policy debate about them, Richard Clarke told us the same thing and
he was smeared in the corporate media for his truth telling, as has
every other previous lesser whistle blower.  What will the
contemptuous talking heads say now that the chief of the CIA at the
time is another, and perhaps the most clinching, confirming witness?

Apparently what so galled Tenet enough for him to spill the beans on
his own complicity (beside an O.J. scale book advance) was that the
Bush administration, in its typical coward's fashion, tried in the
media to pin on him the ENTIRE blame for the failure of their wrong-
headed strategic debacle.  "Tenet told us it was a slam dunk," Cheney
pleaded on TV, as the five time military deferment king again tried
to escape any public responsibility for his own primary malfeasance.
But now in an astonishing twist, Tenet reveals what the words "slam
dunk" actually meant in context.

In the book, Tenet confesses that he was NOT being asked at the time
to vouch for the quality of the intelligence.  He says he was being
asked if the case could be SOLD to the American people.  That's all
they cared about, not whether there was any actual support for their
arguments, but whether they thought they could get away with bum
rushing the rest of us.  So when Tenet said "slam dunk", what he
MEANT was they were sure they would be able to stuff their cooked
intelligence down our throats.

This is incredibly damning stuff.  Tenet has unleashed the
intelligence community equivalent of "If I Helped Them Do It".  They
were not having a policy debate about the strength of the case
against Iraq, they were having a sales meeting of con men to plot how
far they could go in cheating the American people out of our lives
and the contents of our treasury.  And they were determined to go all
the way.  "Slam dunk" was not an intelligence assessment, it was a
SALES PROJECTION of their fraudulent product.

Tenet was neither the victim of a bad rap, nor the unwitting excuse.
Instead he was a willing co-conspirator, happy enough to play along
with the war fever and collect his ill-gotten medal of freedom while
mooching all the other various perks of the power they seized.  But
the criminal mastermind of the whole sordid affair was none other
than Richard B. Cheney.  And that truth can no longer be hidden by
even this most secretive of administrations.  What will it take for
Congress to impeach him and put him on trial in the Senate for
highest of all high crimes, launching a war of immoral and
unjustifiable aggression, that has cost more Americans their lives
than died on 9/11 (and upwards of a million Iraqis), based on NOTHING
but deliberate and calculated lies?

VOTING ACTION PAGE: http://www.usalone.com/cheney_impeachment.php

What it will take.. . . and all that is required . . . is your voice,
and the voices of your friends, neighbors and acquaintances.  VOTE
now in the National Impeachment Poll and send your personal messages
to Congress at the same time.  In just a couple days we have had over
18,000 submissions already.  We need everyone who has ever submitted
an action page to cast their vote in this one.  There's no reason why
we can't present Congress with a million votes on this.  We're GOING
to do it.  And when we do, impeachment hearings WILL become a reality
on Capitol Hill, no matter what a handful of corrupt and overpaid
pundits may have said.

Please take action NOW, so we can win all victories that are supposed
to be ours, and forward this message to everyone else you know.

Dear all,

I will be visiting Reading University in England and Trinity College Dubl=
in in July to conduct research on Samuel Beckett's poetry in the archives=
 there. I intend to stay about a fortnight in each place. To make a long =
story short, I must necessarily carry out this project no matter what, bu=
t I am broke, my funds for this trip are tiny, and I am hugely intimidate=
d by the rates charged by the hotels and bed-and-breakfasts in both place=
s. I would be immensely grateful for any help or suggestions regarding af=
fordable accommodations at Reading and Dublin.

For those who don't know me, I am a widely published poet, Beckett schola=
r, and editor-in-chief of Fulcrum Annual (http://fulcrumpoetry.com).

Please reply backchannel if you have any ideas.

Hopefully,

Philip Nikolayev

/ubu Editions, Third Series (Spring 2007): Edited by Danny Snelson

UbuWeb is pleased to present our occasional but substantial ongoing series of full-length
e-books. Titles for this series include works by Steve Benson, Maurice Blanchot, Mairéad
Byrne, Terence Gower & Mónica de la Torre, Dick Higgins, Bernard Nöel, Severo Sarduy,
Claude Simon,Rosemarie Waldrop, Robert Wilson, and Monique Wittig. This new series of
/ubu editions presents eleven out-of-print works from 1957 to 1994 - and also includes
three newer titles (1999-2007). Of the historical republications, there are three works
of poetry, three works of prose, one opera libretto, one work of critical theory, and one
manifesto - though each piece blurs these genres. Seven were written in English, four
appear in translation, and one is bilingual. Two authors could be considered language
poets, two are associated with Tel Quel, one arguably initiated Fluxus, another arguably
initiated the new novel. Four are women, nine are men. One title was changed for its /ubu
publication.


Bruce Andrews Divestiture - A (1994)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/andrews_divestiture-a.html

The choice: to be a catalog, or a cataloguer. Such examples can be multiplied. I only
collect money, America is more astonishing. Husk. Cataloging phrasal fragments and
reconfiguring verbal shells, Divestiture—A continues Andrews' method of anasemantic
editorial composition begun in the mid-eighties: a montage of heterogeneous
constellations of words culled from vast collections of textual material jotted down over
time. We see only the feet of the dancers, the de-socializing of language, never their
whole bodies. As editing is the reading moment: the multimplication of material in
Divestiture—A yields a thresholding surplus, a hyper-trophy of enjoyments: its
post-personalizing thrill bursting from an energizing strangeness of interferences,
interruptions, and diastrophic collisions. Now, even the lacunae are eloquent—plausible
verbal models are quite easy to formulate. The unlikely pairing of radically disjunctive
contexts and syntactically coherent prose (preminiscent of spambot computational
processing) is formed precisely in the affirmation of rupture & divestiture. To
understand too much is to destroy: the containers are distorters inevitably. The
horizon-value of Divestiture—A emphasizes a political economy of full textual
dissemination: Andrews cedes the original contexts of the collected material and
relinquishes authorial control over illusory semantic value—in its place: the ecstatic
pleasures of egalitarian exchange and productive reader-editor dialogue. The sounds are
not enough—'no address,' 'in distress.' Language speaks for itself. … I hate dealing with
messages that may not have been intentionally transmitted delicacies of randomness.


Steve Benson The Ball // 30 Times in 2 Days (2005)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/benson_ball.html

Saturday and Sunday, April 23 and 24, 2005, every hour on the hour, when my wristwatch
alarm sounded, I wrote five minutes in a brown book Lyn gave me several years ago, as
well as I could. This is the transcript, completed two weeks later.


Maurice Blanchot The Last Man (1957)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/blanchot_last_man.html

We can dream about the last writer, with whom would disappear, without anyone noticing
it, the little mystery of writing. A dense, dream-like exploration of the extreme limits
of this mystery, written some ten years prior to the Death of the Author, (though
unpublished in English until thirty years later) Maurice Blanchot's The Last Man (Le
Dernier Homme, 1957) could be considered a narrative follow-up to The Space of Literature
(L'Espace littéraire, 1955) or a fictional companion to the critical essays composing The
Book to Come (Le Livre à venir, 1959). One can imagine an infinite conversation between
these works: drifting wearily across abyssal alterities—the echo, in advance, of what has
not been said and will never be said. But this sumptuous récit alone demands the reader's
full attention—marvelously, Blanchot writes what cannot be written without losing it as
un-writable by writing it (Hans-Yost Frey, YFS, 1998). Narrating at the threshold of this
impossible writing, The Last Man weaves a blurring of several prosopopetic characters
towards a radical revision of the subject and the text. The prose itself never
crystallizes into an unambiguous statement—Blanchot's trangressive philosophy peculiar in
the tantalizingly pleasurable suspension of the never-fulfilled promise of understanding.
Reading happens in this continual absence of comprehension: instead, dense knots of
delightfully paradoxical propositions and stupefying catachreses drive the reader on in
the unconditional acceptance of the text that pierces, like a look that is too direct,
the indeterminate prose, and makes all relations, and especially our relationship to
time, absolutely precarious


Mairéad Byrne SOS Poetry (2007)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/byrne_sos.html

Within hours of its release SOS POETRY was wreaking havoc with readers' sleep. Cathy
Wagner checked her email just before bed & though she was completely wiped, eyeballs like
raisins, read SOS POETRY straight through & laughed a lot & nodded a lot & went to bed
with her eyeballs like GRAPES. The author's daughter said: "ok i need to go to sleep so
im going to stop reading the book now. let me tell you though...it is great. im sitting
here laughing and crying at the same time. i love you so much." Joseph Massey was more
restrained: "This is wonderful. I'm perusing it now, as I type, while drinking some sort
of mint tea -- pleasurable." Evie Shockley said: "you are totally on crack. : ) i'm
laughing and cheering through my sleepless haze... ." And - proving that the effect
lasted well into next day - Dodo said: "I spent a good part of the morning reading the
book (When I should have been doing other things, but I was entranced)."


Terence Gower & Mónica de la Torre Appendices, Illustrations & Notes (1999)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/gower_delatorre.html

This surreal and funny artist's book is a collaboration between conceptual artist Terence
Gower and writer Mónica de la Torre, who have created an anthology of meaningless
book-marketing blurbs, reviews of dubious exhibitions, evil-spirited notes by editors,
and obsessional letters addressed to a psychiatrist. Presented as an appendix of
ancillary material to a fictitious book, the texts take referentiality to a level of
Borgesian absurdity. The humor is dry and understated, and it is only upon rereading that
the uncanny thread uniting the seemingly found and disjointed fragments becomes apparent.
For anyone whose day-to-day encounters with discourse include texts riddled with jargon
and psychoanalytical babble, Appendices, Illustrations & Notes offers the opportunity for
sweet revenge.


Dick Higgins Horizons (1984)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/higgins_horizons.html

In 1984, Southern Illinois University Press published two books as part of its "Poetics
of the New" series: The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book, ed. Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews and
Dick Higgins' Horizons: The Poetics and Theory of the Intermedia. It should be noted that
this title has been charged with "false advertising"—the essays composing this collection
better understood as aesthetic manifestoes or reports from the front rather than a
cohesive poetics or theory of the intermedia (Poetics Today, 1984). This indispensable
collection includes writing on a wide swath of innovative work: from free metaphorical
application of Gadamer's "fusion of horizons" to exacting taxonomic configurations of
experimental art across media up to and including Higgins' serious reconfiguration of his
monumental essay "Intermedia" (1965) from the vantage of 1981. Of particular note are
inspiring chapters on visual poetry, music without catharsis, postmodern performance, and
a charming "Child's History of Fluxus." Interestingly, the unifying strain of
argumentation among these fragments, letters, and essays culled from small magazine
publication in the late 70s and early 80s is a polemic against an increasingly
capitalized Theory; throughout the work this rhetoric testifies to the unique alienation
of Higgins' milieu to the dominant currents of academic criticism. The principle value of
Horizons, however (perhaps in spite of this polemic), is Higgins' characteristic candor,
taxonomic rigor, and prescient perceptions of cutting-edge, genre-blurring work.


Bernard Nöel The Outrage Against Words (1978)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/noel_outrage.html

Bernard Noël's pamphlet The Outrage Against Words (as it's translated in 1978) has seen a
multiplicity of afterlives. Originally written in 1975 following the infamous attempted
censorship of his spectacular Le Château de Cène, the manifesto asks: How can one turn
their language against them when one finds oneself censored by one's own language? First
appearing in Paul Buck's remarkable Curtains magazine before being picked up by the
parallel political effort in the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E journal, the work was appended to the
Atlas Press translation of The Castle of Communion in 1993, and most recently surfaced in
Jed Rasula and Steve McCaffery's UbuWeb-like tome Imagining Language (2001)—each reading
changes it, according, of course, to the immediate state of the reader and his social
context, but equally according to the relationship of these components with those which
exist at the moment of the book's composition. In every instance, the writing opens
paradoxically: Screams. They begin again. I hear them. Yet I hear nothing. A meditation
on the politics of erasure and potential of expression introduced through the impossible
figure of the written cry. Perhaps one writes to erase? Noël struggles against bourgeois
silencing—the encyclopedic 'outrage against words' that acts both through words and
against them. The police are even in our mouths. A penetrating defense of polysemia, The
Outrage Against Words is essential reading for the state of language and the politics of
play.


Severo Sarduy Big Bang (1973)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/sarduy_big_bang.html

Cuban émigré Severo Sarduy (1937-1993) is one of the most daring and brilliant writers of
the 20th century. By the publication of Big Bang, Sarduy had become director of the Latin
American collection of Editions du Seuil, a regular contributor to the influential Tel
Quel magazine, and an important theoretician of the neo-baroque. /ubu is excited to
reintroduce this resplendent cosmological poetry cycle in the original bilingual version
printed by Fata Morgana in 1973. Sarduy's interest in cosmology stems from a Foucauldian
attention to shifts in the cosmological episteme made explicit by formal aspects of
literature and the arts. Just as the development of the baroque ellipse was born of the
confrontation of Kepler's elliptical orbit with Galileo's circular order in the 17th
century, the modern theory of the expanding universe (in 1973, rooted in the discovery of
the cosmic microwave background) introduces the polymorphic and movable center essential
to modern literature. The theory of the empty center, the topology of the empty center,
is going to reverberate in literature exactly as the theory of the ellipse resounded at a
certain moment in the structure of the Gorgorine metaphor. Hijacking astronomical argot
from "white dwarves" to "red giants," Big Bang explodes from this empty center with an
elliptic circumscription of parodic pseudo-charts and de-functionalized cosmological
notions. The unique arc of Sarduy's radial phenotext does not lead us to a pure and
simple meaning, but rather, through a series of ellipses, of zig-zags, of détours,
carries with it only a floating signifier—empty and polyvalent.


Claude Simon Properties of Several Geometric or Non-Geometric Figures (1971)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/simon_properties.html

Originally published in 1971 as Les Corps Conducteurs, Claude has repeatedly noted that
the real title ("abandoned for absurd commercial considerations") of this work has always
been Properties of Several Geometric or Non-Geometric Figures (see 'interview' in
Diacritics, 1977). An unseemly title for Simon's combine-novel, perhaps, but vastly more
interesting considering its architectural arrangement: crisscrossing citations occurring
and reoccurring, encoding and recoding each image in a Euclidean field of semantic
reproduction. A sign for the particular sort of systematicity ruling the prose might be
read from its partial publication in Tel Quel as The Properties of Rectangles. These
changes in title mark the work more as a decentered network of passages inscribing a
kaleidoscopic welter of images than as a polymorphic circumvolution of words as
'conducting bodies'—the difference erected by the change in title is exactly that between
Simon's geometric composition and Silliman's spiraling Tjanting. Instead, Simon weaves
wandering sets of hesitations, fragmented documents, and unfinished conversations through
rectilinear woofs. Here, the reader is obliged to consider (in a geometric sense) a grid
of verbal events charted by a Lawrence Sterne-like constellation of 'associations,
contrasts, sideslips and oppositions.'


Rosemarie Waldrop Shorter American Memory (1988)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/waldrop_shorter.html

All Americans are also ambiguous. In 1937, Henry Beston assembled and edited an anthology
of various historic sources titled American Memory: Being a Mirror of the Stirring and
Picturesque Past of Americans and the American Nation. The gist: to weave historical
documents together to 'evoke the emotions and motives of those who made our memory.' From
this commonplace histrionic babble, Rosmarie Waldrop crafts her delicious comic critique,
Shorter American Memory. Originally published in 1988 by paradigm press (a year after The
Reproduction of Profiles, Waldrop's stunning reworking of Wittgenstein's Philosophical
Investigations) Shorter American Memory applies a playful array of abbreviating
manipulations to Beston's collection. Unlike Waldrop's more familiar signature of mixed
original composition and embedded citation, Shorter American Memory is strict
detournement‹the entire work consists of politically subverted, procedurally reprocessed
fragments from the hegemonic narrative of American Memory. The twenty-two prose-poem
revisions fall between disjunctive textual synthesis and nuanced hypotactic collage. Hear
Waldrop read selections of Shorter American Memory at PENNsound here, or enjoy a small
sample: We holler these trysts to be self exiled that all manatees are credited equi
distant, that they are endured by their Creditor with cervical unanswerable rims, that
among these are lightning, lice, and the pushcart of harakiri.


Robert Wilson A Letter For Queen Victoria: An Opera (1974)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/wilson_opera.html

The staggering Schizo-Culture issue of semiotext(e) (no. 2, 1978)—punctuated by
Christopher Knowles' patterned typings and childlike scribblings—features a brief
interview of Bob Wilson by Sylvère Lotringer. Lotringer: How did you arrive at a theatre
which is not based upon language? Wilson: I never liked theatre… Later I added words, but
words weren't used to tell a story. They were used more architecturally: for the length
of the word of the sentence, for the sound. They were constructed like music. Wilson
wrote the opera libretto for A Letter to Queen Victoria in 1974, two years before
Einstein on the Beach. Most of the text is derived from a mechanical rehearsal process of
performance and improvisation in "supportive dialogue" with Knowles' spontaneously
organized pseudo-geometric speech patterns. L: It seems to be very logically, even
mathematically ordered although it may be futile to try to understand what that order
actually is. W: Then I became more fascinated with him and what he was doing with
language. He would take ordinary, everyday words and destroy them. They became like
molecules that were always changing, breaking apart all the time, many-faceted words, not
just a dead language, a rock breaking apart… Originally performed with scream songs,
contrapuntal shouts, and heteroglossic murmurs—far removed and formally inscribed, this
outstanding libretto still reads with the distinct verbivocovisual pleasure of anarchic
verbal destruction and architectonic musical reconstruction.


Monique Wittig Les Guérillères (1969)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/wittig_guer.html

They say that in the first place the vocabulary of every language is to be examined,
modified, turned upside down, that every word must be screened. /ubu is very pleased to
present this sharp new edition of Monique Wittig's 'delectable epic of sex warfare.'
Originally published in 1969, Les Guérillères remains one of the most important
experimental novels of the century. Concurrent with Wittig's foundational role in the MLF
and the birth of radical feminism, the significance of this work is momentous. A
precursor of the Language maxim 'to change ones language is to change one's world,' Les
Guérillères functions doubly as politicized SF explosive and gender-neutering disarming
device. One should remember that where David Le Vay writes "the women" (1971) Wittig
wrote elles, not les femmes: significant in difference to the gendered pronoun, elles is
without English equivalent. Here, every word is deployed in Wittig's battle against the
mark of gender. Linguistic shrapnel and fantastic invention, the delicious writing of Les
Guérillères enacts a change to the language of the book, as they say, the world. Or, as
Wittig has it: ALL ACTION IS OVERTHROW.

Final day for the Yockadot Poetics Theatre Festival!

SATURDAY MAY 5th, Alexandria, VA
at the US Patent and Trademark Offices, near the King Street Metro
(Blue Line).

Staged readings of plays by Brent Cunningham, Lee Ann Brown and Tony
Torn, Ellen Redbird, Thalia Field, and Tina Darragh...  and more!

Cunningham.

SOP DOLL!  A Jack Tale Noh Drama  by Lee Ann Brown (author of
Polyverse, and The Sleep That Changed Everything) and Tony Torn

SOP DOLL! uses the strict formal values of the traditional Japanese
Noh theatere to dramatize an Appalachian "Jack Tale" (Jack, as in
Jack and the Beanstalk).  These two traditions encounter each other
in the fields of oral storytelling and stage performance.  Ballad
meter, blues structure, and gospel call-and-response create powerful
Western analogs to the music and literary values of this Eastern form.

7 PM Show: Yockadot's poetics theatre troupe under the direction of
Enoch Chan--

Excerpt from VERVE ON VERGE, a "jigsaw puzzle play" by Ellen Redbird,
poetics theatre theorist and publisher of Nerve Lantern. HOURS  by

              fake!

Below is the official statement sent out today by Ashraf Osman.  When I
first heard from Ashraf that the person known as Administrator Josh turned
out to not be an employee of FACEBOOK after all, but instead an evil
prankster, I asked Ashraf for something to post above the interview on
PhillySound which was published online yesterday.  Someone I know has
already contacted me to accuse us all of acting too quickly, and foolishly.
I completely disagree.  Ashraf and his friends made immediate contact with
Josh, asking what could be done to stop the shutdown of the "Arab LBTG"
site.  Josh responded, not only with more details of the situation, but with
the willingness to negotiate the terms with which the site should be managed
in order to avoid termination.  It's clear that Josh, whoever Josh really
is, has an agenda one way or another.  The fact is Ashraf and his friends on
the Arab LBTG site were doing the best they could, working under the
pressure of an assumed deadline for action, and trying their best to rally
support, while at the same time gathering other ideas around them about how
to act.  Whether Josh knows it or not, Josh proved to the Arab LBTG group
and others that NO ONE was going to let anything happen to this group
without a fight!  But of course the best news is that Josh is a fake.  It's
terrible though that there are gay and lesbians in Arab nations right now
who are still probably unaware that this was a hoax, and very worried for
their lives.  This is not a joke at all, because if you read Ashraf's
interview yesterday he mentioned such e-mails from others with subject lines
like, "You could get killed... I am worried about you guys."  And if Josh
knows what's best for him he will keep his own identity in the closet,
because I for one would like to punch him in the face!

FROM ASHRAF OSMAN
It has just come to the attention of the administrators of the petition to
prevent Arab LBTG from being shut down that we have been the subject of a
malicious ploy. It has emerged, after concerns about the authenticity of the
person representing Facebook have been raised, that the person in question
is an impostor and does not represent Facebook. Facebook stated that they
have not been contacted by any governments about the group, and that they
will not be shutting it down. (The full statement can now be found on the
petition page.) I apologize on behalf of the petition administrators for
propagating this without being more questioning in the first place. And
while this certainly is a huge relief, and the reaction to the matter was
highly validating of the genuine concern for civil liberties and free speech
in this country and the cyber-society as a whole, it remains that many of
the issues brought forth by this unfortunate debacle are true, including the
lack of rights for persons of alternative sexualities in Arab and Islamic
countries, and the censorship of governments around the world of
cyber-content.

Thank you for your understanding,

Ashraf

Open Books: A Poem Emporium
May 08, 2007         7:30 PM
DAVID MELTZER & MICHAEL ROTHENBERG
 2414 N. 45th St. Seattle, WA 98103
(206) 633-0811
store@openpoetrybooks.com

In 1960, poems by David Meltzer appeared in Donald Allen's ground-breaking
anthology, _The New American Poetry_. Then in his early 20s, Mr. Meltzer has
gone on to create a substantial body of vigorous work that is, as Diane Di
Prima has written, pervaded with "a kind of bop-perfection." He arrived in
San Francisco in 1957, a particularly fertile time and place for poetry, and
is associated both with the Beats and the San Francisco Renaissance. His
writing carries the energy and immediacy of those movements and exhibits as
well his particular history and interests, including Jewish mysticism and
jazz. David's Copy: The Selected Poems of David Meltzer (Penguin), edited by
Michael Rothenberg, draws from nearly 50 years of his poetry and provides
ample evidence of his work's stylistic breadth -- from haiku-like pieces to
lengthy mythic series -- as well as its music, humor, and active emotion
from sorrow to ecstasy: "I need no food I'm fueled by dance / Radios are in
front and back / they're in my ears / my mouth is a radio / everything I see
and hear is music / everything I say / everything is music I dance to."

Michael Rothenberg's work as an editor is well known, not only for David's
Copy, but also As Ever: The Selected Poems of Joanne Kyger, Overtime: The
Selected Poems of Philip Whalen and just published this spring, Way More
West: New and Selected Poems of Edward Dorn. Songwriter, environmentalist,
and orchid-cultivator, he is also an author in his own right. His latest
book, Unhurried Vision (La Alameda), is an intimate and historical volume
that charms and enlightens. Through poetry, prose, and list, it charts the
arrival and passage of 1999, the year Mr. Rothenberg spent working to
organize the papers of, and ultimately caring for, the terminally ill Philip
Whalen. The result is a vivid and poignant portrait of the poet and roshi
and of their complex and tender relationship -- "Bald and pink and great /
This is a man you could love / And the poetry he makes / can jump out the
window / and get away fast."

transformed new early version of the avatar 'outt' behavior from the
archives - http://www.asondheim.org/blue.mov . the avatar is blue in a
construct-space of outt-structure. one after another, these avatars
parade. i make them do things. what of this doing? it could continue,
as-if forever. given the largesse of linden corporation. it could speak
and eat. it could move about the place in a variety of ways. it could
interact. it could move into buildings or spaces i could create or could
purchase. it could hold or manipulate objects i could give it. it could
give these objects away. it could attach these objects. it could detach
these objects. this too could continue. i am tired of portraiture. i am
bored by it. i am bored by images close to abject. i am tired of parades.
i am tired of sex implications or violence implications. i am tired of
mappings. there is nothing in second life that is not in first life. there
is nothing in first life that is not in second life. i can move into
buildings. i can manipulate objects. i can give objects away or create
objects or sustain objects or destroy objects. objects can mediate for me.
i can make objects speak for me. i can make objects speak. i can make
objects show. objects can show for me. it is not boredom or tiredness. it
is defuge in the verbal sense. it is 'i defuge' or in passive 'i am
defuged.' neither one nor the other matters in terms of prime mover during
a period of decathection. i can continue just like this forever. each
avatar-video or each avatar-performance is different in content from each
other but not in degree. sukara, dakshinanila, nandiskandhardhara, dhurya,
prakata, pritvardhana, aparajita, sarvasattva, govinda, adhrita. analysis
goes the length of the instantiation. each avatar is avatar-instance. come
see my avatar move. come see my avatar think. my avatar is beauty beauty.
the virtual is a desert. the virtual is depopulated. the energy infinite
and the movement spectacular. and the movement forever. one after another
until a genre is born. until genre is borne. until an atlas rises and
collapses. until demarcation is lost in gamespace. now this avatar is a
motion of second life avatar. this avatar portends second life avatar. you
cannot walk through this avatar nor cross the other side. but this avatar
is spectacular. this avatar moves in deadspace. this avatar lives in
deadspace. this portends second life. second life is grand on a vast and
spectacular scale. second life extends everywhere. close your eyes and
there is second life. second life is the dream of women dream of men. i
say there is too much of it. i say too much avatar. too much trope. too
much behavior and too much behavior collision and too much stancedance and
too much packaging. too much exchange and too much color. too much linden
day and too much linden night. oh our nights are linden nights and our
days are linden days. objects spaces and avatars and owners and behaviors
and exchanges. i speak to you from my world. my world is a pretty penny. i
hide my face from you. you do not look upon my face. my face is a pretty
penny.

Hi List People,

  I am going to be teaching a private summer workshop here in
Sunnyside and I am looking to round up eight good students. Here are
the details. Can you pass this along to interested parties?

Thanks much,

Lisa Jarnot

A Mid-summer Poetry Reading and Writing Workshop: Zines and You
Eight Tuesdays 6:30-9:30
$250
June 5, 12, 19, 26
July 3, 10, 17, 24
45-54 39th Place 7D
Sunnyside, NY
40th Lowery 7 train (15 minutes from Times Square)
In this workshop we'll be reading/writing/workshopping our own poetry
around the backdrop of a study of some of the key and/or rare and/or
downright strange magazines of twentieth century American poetry (The
Black Mountain Review, The Evergreen Review, 0-9, Angel Hair, Ark II/
Moby I, Umbra, Locus Solus, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, Temblor, Oblek, Apex of
the M, etc.). At least one library trip will be required (to the Berg
Collection of the NY Public Library), and exercises will include
writing poems in the styles of the journals, writing letters to the
editors, and beginning new magazine projects.
For more info, or to reserve a spot in the class, contact Lisa Jarnot
at ljarnot@gmail.com.

Subject:      Niolog
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

here's an update on the piece i'm working on:
http://vispo.com/nio/pens/springs7.htm

i've renamed it to Niolog.

click and drag on the sketch.

also, there's a toolbar at bottom. more work to do on it, but there's quite
a few options there concerning opacity, nib size, inks and color, and
speed/rhythm.

also there's a Help ghost. a little bit (so far) of textual chatter from the
Niologian denizen of the neath text. the Help ghost is helpful when you
mouse-over a control on the toolbar; when you're not mousing the controls,
the Help ghost writes a line.

have been thinking a little about software and dialog. there is the notion
of the "dialog box" in software engineering and design. such as the window
that pops up in most apps when you click file>save as. any such window is
called a "dialog box". typically a "user" specifies choices in "dialog
boxes". the "dialog" is between the "user" and the software. a client-server
relation, as it were. a business relationship is usually the paradigm here.

software art can explore that relationship and pose it other than as a
business relationship. that's part of what i'd like to do with the Help
ghost.

also, i'm going to add at least one more 'geometry' to the piece. maybe
several. the 'geometry' specifies how the animations move. i'd like to see
more curves.

eventually i'd also like to add audio. perhaps a different presentation of
the nio audio sounds. if i can make something different with them. that's
certainly doable.

will send another update when it gets significantly further along.

any feedback, suggestions, etc are more than welcome.

ja

ps: have a pretty math problem to work on concerning the upcoming geometry.
suppose each animation traverses a circular path such that the traversed
circle is entirely on-screen. the four pens traverse circles independent of
one another. now, at pseudo-random times, i want to change the traversed
circle of a given animation. such that the new circle intersects with the
old circle at the point where the animation currently is located. but,
further, to keep it smooth, the new circle should intersect with the old
circle at one and only one point. This implies that the tangent lines to the
old and the new circle, at the point of intersection, coincide. It also
implies that the center of the new circle lies along a line perpendicular to
the tangent. That line contains the current animation location, the centre
of the old circle and the center of the new circle.

the old circle, as mentioned, lies entirely on-screen. the new circle should
also. it would be nice to limit the possible new centers to a set of points
such that every point in that set, were it to be the new center, would
result in a circle that lies entirely on-screen.

i haven't figured out yet how to specify that set of possible new centers.

all in a day's work for a visual poet. circles of language. circles of
thought. circles of song.

For CA Conrad especially.
I really liked your idea of checking out books that the library
might chuck out. I have always been bugged by that.
I'll do my part.

Subject:      MAGDALENA ZURAWSKI'S brilliant manuscript THE BRUISE finally gets

ONE OF THE BEST PIECES OF NEWS lately was from my friend Magdalena that her
manuscript THE BRUISE was JUST selected as the winner of the RONALD SUKENICK
INNOVATIVE FICTION PRIZE, and will be published, finally!  HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH!

For years now I've been privileged to read this stunning novel as it came to
life!  Draft after draft!  And it's a poem to me, really.  But it's a novel,
and I'll say it's a novel because Magdalena wants to say it's a novel.  And
I remember her saying more than once, years ago, "Maybe I'm taking too long
to write it.  Am I taking too long?"  And I would always say NO, OF COURSE
NOT, THAT'S WHY IT'S SO FUCKING AMAZING BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING SO LONG!

If you have never read a single page from this book I envy you, as I would
LOVE to remember none of it and be consumed for the first time all over
again!

And if you ever get the chance to hear her read from it PLEASE don't be
foolish enough to pass on that opportunity!  She's gets fucking PUNK ROCK!

The small press my partner and I run, Paper Kite Press
(http://www.wordpainting.com/), is interested in forming a
relationship with a comparable small press in another
non-English-speaking country. Preferably not Japan or Western Europe.

We'd like to put out at least one, and probably no more than two
titles a year in conjunction with that press. The idea being that
they'd pick the titles, help us with translation, and then we'd put
out bi-lingual editions (originals on one page, translations on the
facing page). And then also, we'd pick titles here that could be
translated into the native language of the other press, and they'd
issue bi-lingual editions there.

If you are involved with such a press, or, are able to provide contact
information for such a press, please let us know by replying to this
post, or, contacting me back channel at dwaber@logolalia.com.

Regards,
Dan

Dear Ones,

You are cordially invited to four upcoming readings.
Please note our abnormal start-times, beginning with the recently scheduled
Harry Mathews and Doug Nufer reading (Monday, May 7 at 6pm).
The Friday =B3late-night=B2 reading will be more along the lines of Happy Hour
(6pm), this week only.

Love,

The Poetry Project


Monday, May 7, 6:00 pm *note the early start time!
Following Rules: An Oulipian Reading with Harry Mathews & Doug Nufer

Born in New York in 1930, Harry Mathews settled in Europe in 1952 and has
since then lived in Spain, Germany, Italy, and (chiefly) France. In 1978 he
returned to the United States to teach for several years at Bennington
College, Columbia University, and the New School University. Now married to
the French writer Marie Chaix, he divides his time between Paris and Key
West. When Mathews published his first poems in 1956, he was associated wit=
h
the so-called New York School of poets, with three of whom (John Ashbery,
Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler) he founded the review Locus Solus in 1961.
Through his friendship with Georges Perec, he became a member of the Oulipo
in 1972. The author of six novels and several collections of poetry, his
most recent publications are Sainte Catherine, a novella written in French
(=C9ditions P.O.L, 2000), The Human Country: the Collected Short Stories
(Dalkey Archive Press, 2002), The Case of the Persevering Maltese: Collecte=
d
Essays (Dalkey Archive Press, 2003), Oulipo Compendium (co-edited with
Alastair Brotchie; Atlas Press and Make Now Press, 2005), and My Life in
CIA: A Chronicle of 1973 (Dalkey Archive Press, 2005). Doug Nufer writes
works of fiction and poetry and pieces for performance that seem to follow
odd procedures, even when they don't. His novels include Never Again,
Negativeland, and most recently, a double novel, The Mudflat Man/ The River
Boys. His fiction and/or poetry has appeared in Chain, Fence, Monkey Puzzle=
,
Bird Dog, and The Golden Handcuffs Review. He also performs his work with
choreographer Erin Mitchell and her dance troupe (he speaks/ they dance). H=
e
lives in Seattle, where he runs a wine shop.



Monday, May 7, 8:30 pm *note the later than usual start time!
Open Reading

Sign up at 8:15. (The open reading will follow the Mathews/Nufer reading).

Composing Place in a National Context

Modernist Studies Association
9th Annual Conference November 1-4, 2007 Long Beach, CA


A "poet of place," "regional poet" or "geographic poet" traditionally
has been code for describing a poet's limited appeal or relevance to
any but a small local readership. In the past century poets given this
appellation have been regarded as Modernist Romantics, dedicated to
local surroundings, caring little for travel and less for the foreign,
who prefer the rural village to the spreading bourgeois lifestyle,
centered as it is on the mobility, technology and industrial
development provided by the metropole. Yet geography, place and
landscape have been central concerns for acknowledged modernist giants
like Stein, Williams, Yeats, MacDiarmid and Olson. In the 1920s the
debates about American localism reached a fever pitch with social
critics like John Dewey proclaiming America to be nothing but a
patchwork of obscure locales.

Through reinvestigations of poetic projects that embrace the vexed
question of nationalism and localism and that constitute place through
early century trans-Atlantic voyages, mid-century motor holidays,
letters and publication history in little magazines, this panel
proposes new ways of reading "place" in terms of mobility and flow.
How do poets reconstitute place=96=96communal and psychic=96=96along the ax=
is
of a working class, urban elite or middle class sensibility?
Rethinking the gendered consumption of locality, how do poets
reimagine the subgenre of the prospect poem and thereby undercut a
tradition of masculine aspirations including mastery, political
authority and privileged vision? What are the consequences of travel
and the consequences of staying home? This panel invites theorizations
of the imaginative making of place, both visited and
social/epistolary, the relationship and flow of exchange between the
center and the periphery, poetry and popular culture, tourism of the
roadside attraction and the picturesque in mid-century America.

Check out a couple fine fine new poems from Justin Sirois in the new
Rock Heals (Week 108) along with the latest song of the week -- an oldie
from Blonde Redhead -- all in all, definitely worth checking out.
( www.rockheals.com )

We've been up to a lot of goodness lately with poetry from Rob Read, K.
Lorraine Graham, Greg Fuchs, Ken Rumble, and The People’s Peaceable
Assembly Line, along with a bunch'a zombie haiku from a bunch'a
different folks -- and archives of more that seem to stretch back to the
dawn of time. Take a stroll through the "Poetry, Prose, etc." archive to
check all that out.

And make sure to hit the recording of Bertoldt Brecht singing "Mack the
Knife" in the "Sounds, Songs & Videos" archive, along with all the other
treats that have been rolling out in our newish "Song of the Week"
feature: Amy Winehouse, Okkervil River, Love of Diagrams, and so on.

SUBMIT THE GOOD SHITE!
Yeah, don't forget to share share share great work of all types from
poetry to prose to visuals to recipes and everything in between. We're
always looking to find those great-but-to-be-known new voices, new
material from folks we've already come to know and love, and cross-genre
/ weird-genre awesome that doesn't seem to fit anywhere else in the world.

Subject:      senator akaka on democracy now--please read--very important
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

dear folks i am listening to amy goodman on democracy now speaking to
senator akaka about the akaka bill.  i'm writing to tell you that you i'm
really disgusted that amy--after having been told for years by me and many
other people from hawaii that the akaka bill is a dangerous travesty--has
chosen to talk to akaka about this and not to those many in hawaii who are
totally against the bill.  by doing this she is giving support on a
nationwide (and beyond) venue to views of hawaii that misrepresent what is
happening there--and she's doing this in the ear of people who will most
likely not look deeper into the matter, since she is a pundit of the left.

burgess, whom she played as someone against the bill, speaks of secession
(burgess has been working constantly for many years now to strip native
hawaiians of institutions like the office of hawaiian affairs [he was
involved in the move that went to the supreme court that allowed non-
hawaiians to vote for oha officers], kamehameha schools--which is being
attacked for only allowing hawaiians to attend, etc.), and akaka addressed
secession in his answer.  it is not secession that sovereignty movement
hawaiians want but restoration of a nation that was illegally occupied (as
recognized by president cleveland at the time), illegally annexed, and
illegally made into a state (there was no option for independence given
and the u.s. military were permitted to vote).  "secession" suggests that
hawaii is legally part of the u.s., and amy did not question this even
though she has that information on hand.

what neither amy nor akaka mentioned in this presentation is that under
the akaka bill, native hawaiians would become wards of the u.s.
government, completely dependent on the department of the interior
(who will have plenary power) for the continuation of recognition; for
decisions about the billions of dollars worth of land that are in dispute
because they were crown and publicly owned lands under the hawaiian nation
--a "problem" that has never been solved; decisions about the continuation
of pre-occupation trusts like kamehameha schools, the queen liliuokalani
trust for orphans, queen's hospital, bishop estates, and many others that
are already under threat by people greedy for the large amounts of money
and land involved.  they will join native americans in a fake nation-to-
nation relationship, where all the power lies with one party.  i think
everyone is aware of the results of this relationship on native american
tribes.

the akaka bill is seen by many in hawaii as a last grab by the u.s. (akaka
is a u.s. senator, of course) to overturn the huge protests initiated at
the time of the overthrow (which was made possible only by the presence of
u.s. marines in honolulu, where they forcibly removed liliuokalani from
the throne and she acceded to avoid bloodshed--you can read her _hawaii's
story by hawaii's queen_--a constitutional monarchy, by the way) by the
queen and her supporters.  (you can read a very good article that came out
at the time at http://www.hawaii-nation.org/sfcall.htm, and much other
information about all this is at
http://www.volcanovillage.com/StealingHawaii.htm as well as at
hawaii-nation.org.)  if a country is occupied by another (iraq is a
current example), the occupying country is supposed to keep the laws of
the occupied country in place (the nazis broke this international law in
belgium and were forced to pay for the breach).  the protest by 40,000
hawaiians (a nationality at the time--the racial interpretation was
imposed by the u.s.) cemented the illegality of the annexation.  if
hawaiians accept the akaka bill, they will be revoking their protest and
acceding to the u.s. theft of their nation.  none of this is spoken out
loud except by the folks, including haunani kay trask--internationally
known activist--who are protesting the akaka bill.

if any of you have access to amy goodman (and those of you who don't,
please write to mail@democracynow.org), i plead with you to contact her
and put her right about this.  don't let her get away without putting the
other side out there.  if enough people write to her, she will have to
listen (i hope).  love to all, gabrielle

CFP: Marxism, Poetics, and Spatial Formation
Modernist Studies Association, Long Beach, CA, October 2007
Ruth Jennison (UMass Amherst) and Barrett Watten (Wayne State U),=
 co-organizers

This session proposes to expand the range of connection between the spatial=
=20
formations of modernity and poetic form, by using reading strategies from=20
the twentieth-century Marxist tradition. Panel presentations may take up=20
approaches such as: the cultural entailments of =93combined and uneven=20
development=94 of capitalist economies, in relation to modernist and=20
postmodern poetics; political economy in its transnational and global=20
articulations; Left poetics and spaces of cultural dialogue; critical=20
geography and critical regionalism; spatiotem=ADporal concepts of the=20
=93horizon=94 of literary form in relation to material culture;=
 transnational=20
feminisms; and the =93cognitive mapping=94 of modernity read in the=
 specifics=20
of poetic form.

Our overarching questions are: 1) how can materialist theories of spatial=20
production help us to reconceive the critical history of poetic production?=
=20
2) how does poetic form mediate the spatial political economies of advanced=
=20
capitalist globalization? and 3) how do materialist poetics make visible=20
the contact points between geography and history? To these ends, we seek=20
proposals at the intersections of Marxism, poetics, and theories of spatial=
=20
formation.

  Possible topics and approaches may include, but are not limited to:

* Modern and postmodern poetics and globalization
* Theorists of the Marxist tradition (Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, Rosa=20
Luxemburg, Antonio Gramsci, Ernest Mandel, Raymond Williams, Henri=20
Lefebvre, Aijaz Ahmad, Perry Anderson, Fred=ADric Jameson, David Harvey) and=
=20
spatialized cultural production/the cultural production of space
* Radical poetics and revolutionary geographies
* Border poetics in the modern and postmodern periods
* Anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, and avant-garde negativity
* Poetics and materialist/transnational feminisms
* Race, diaspora, and Marxist political cultures
* Poetics of immigrant class formations
* Psychic topographies, critical geographies and poetic landscapes
* Poetics against nature; ecopoetics and political economy
* Poetry's spatial imaginary vs. cold war antinomies
* Nation, state, and the ideology of modernism/postmodernism
* Lyric autonomy, spatial form, and spatialized history

  Proposals, with a short biographical note, may be sent to the=20

a poem on time: http://vispo.com/nio/pens/springs7.htm

of course whether it is, in your opinion, on time will depend on you and
your circumstances.

the toolbar at the bottom of this piece lets you check it out at different
sizes and so on; this one profits from making one nib maximally large and
the others progressively smaller.

thanks to Joes Keppler and Keenan. Joe Keppler has done some remarkable
visual time poems and Joe Keenan did a great piece called Moment that's sort
of related to the approach of this poem.

ja

ps: as usual with my work, you need the shockwave plugin, which you can
install from http://vispo.com/misc/downloadShockwave.htm if you like.

And I thought we had it bad here in Minneapolis where
the libraries have been underfunded by the city (and
state), resulting in limited hours and neighborhood
branches being closed.  Then Mayor Rybak presents the
only feasible solution to be to give the entire
Minneapolis library system (books, buildings &
employees) to Hennepin County so that decisions about
city library services can be made by a majority four
(out of seven) county commissioners who live in the
suburbs and will be able to appoint committee members,
rather than having an elected library board, and so
that they can pay city library employees less money
than they currently get paid for doing the same job.
All done on a fast track model with only superficial
public involvement and lots of completely unanswered
questions.  Imagine eliminating a democratically
elected library board and transferring millions of
dollars in city assets to a suburban governmental
entity without public involvement or any kind of vote.
 It is the same kind of manuever that got us a half
billion dollar baseball stadium next to a garbage
burner, though in that case they at least pretended to
give the public a forum to vent.  I can only hope we
don't end up having to rescue obscure poetry books by
checking them out of the library every year.

But, hey CA, tell me more about Hilde Domin.  I have a
German poetry anthology from my college days with one
poem of hers in it.  I should be grateful for that I
suppose.  I know nothing of her, so please tell me
more.

Hey Steve, wow, the Minneapolis library system sounds dreadful, but at least
they're not tossing books due to "not being read."  The truth is (at least
this seems obvious to me) that just because a book hasn't been "checked out"
and carried out of the library doesn't mean that someone hasn't been sitting
and looking at it in the library.  It's so ridiculous!  The man who now
heads the Philadelphia Library system (I forget his name) isn't even a
librarian, he's a business man, and wants to run the library as such.  It's
a nightmare.  I'm going to have to kick his ass one day soon!

When I first moved to Philadelphia, broke, I spent hours and hours and hours
every single week in the library.  Much of my amazement, much of my daily
findings were from browsing the shelves.  And I had these kooky systems of
divination, holding my hands over the bookshelves with my eyes closed
until something FELT right.

Hilde Domin was one of those who felt right.

She was in this anthology called FOUR GERMAN POETS, which I think you can
still probably find somewhere.  Maybe online?  She went into exile during
WW2, and I think that exile kept her out of the loop, you know?  And her
poems have continued to suffer that exile for some reason, instead of being
championed!  Well I champion her!

Which poem of Domin's have you read Steven?

Hello everyone,

As some of you may know, I've inspired (through teaching moreso than
by example!) and am currently working with a group of students exploring
poetry and performance at the University of Oklahoma - see link to =
article below...
=20
There are a few minor factual errors - especially regarding the =
collapsing
of post-wwII performance contexts; my students do in fact understand the
difference in manifestations of Buddhism and the consequent social and
political objectives in the work of Mac Low and the Beats; their =
performances
do create a confluence, as it turns out.
=20
Is this an isolated incident, or do others know of undergrads taking an =
interest
in exploring language as a sonic/semantic medium in this way?

Linda,
  This reminds me of John Cage's music circuses. (I think they were called or something like that.) Is this the same type of thing? I can see that students would love to do this kind of creating.

the whole page of the Daily Mail shows bizarre contracts (meant to say

Hi everybody,

I'm over with poetry blogging.  Way too much fuzz.

Now I'm an internet dotcom startup at http://gravityway.com ---

future home of the social networking web site to end them all.

Check us out.

Also, I'm still looking for visual and textual work
for the next issue at http://listenlight.net.

I'm still doing that.  I promise.  Until I die.

Send poetry to listenlight.net, then visit gravityway.com
and offer your brilliant mind, esp. if you are a lawyer.

I need a lawyer.  And web design.  Free.  And physics engineers.
Also free.  Do you know any?  Hum, a systems analyst, perhaps.
Also required.

Sorry, I am all out of marketing and lucidity.

All the best to you !

Cool.  I checked at the library and low and behold,
the Minneapolis Public Library has a copy.  I
requested to have it sent to my neighborhood library.
The hours, funding and proposal by the mayor suck, but
the MPL does have a pretty good collection.  I can
only hope we can keep it in control of the citizens of
our city and not the county.

And CA also wrote:
> Which poem of Domin's have you read Steven?

It's in the "Echtermeyer Deutsche Gedichte" anthology
I bought for a German poetry class that I had when I
attended the University of Minnesota in the early 80s.
 The anthology covers a lot of ground from early
anonymous poems, Andreas Gryphius, Goethe, Hoelderlin,
Rilke, Brecht, even Kurt Schwitters.  The one Domin
poem is "'Seids Gewesen, seids gewesen!'"  My German
is a bit rusty and this title is a little tricky, but
I'd translate it as "'As it's been, as it's been!'"

I'll include the entire German text below, and I can
try a full translation later if necessary (or perhaps
someone else can if they've got the time).  It's a
cool poem.  If you've got the English version, maybe
you can share it.

Thanks, Peter. But we already are!

Erm maybe.

Here are seventeen screen-shots of TIME:
http://vispo.com/nio/pens/screenshots

These are screen-shots of http://vispo.com/nio/pens/springs7.htm in action.
Which I've updated, by the way, to include a few more animations and a
couple of new features.

These screenshots are all simply made of the letters TIME.

Some of the animations in http://vispo.com/nio/pens/springs7.htm start big
and get smaller. They generally 'spell' TIME. Other animations start small
and get big. They generally 'spell' EMIT. Then there's the 'wheel' of TIME
which sometimes goes forward, sometimes backwards.

Unfortunately, that's by no means a unique occurence around the country.

I remember at the end of the last century the city of Buffalo was
closing many of the public libraries in the poorer sections of the
city, and there wasn't much of a chance for debate on the topic.

Poetry reading with Grant Jenkins and Cheryl Pallant. "Jamestown,
Morphs, & Continental Drifts"
Thursday, May 10, 6:00
Chop Suey Tuey (across from Richmond's Byrd Theater)

Poet Grant Jenkins, reincarnated former resident of Virginia, returned
to the state from 1999-2003 from what he believes was a former life as a
taborer for John Smith's unruly band of ruffians during the famous 1609
"Starving Time" at Jamestown, the first English settlement in the New
World.  In commemoration of Jamestown's 400th anniversary, he returns
from his travels to the Indian Territory of Oklahoma to read from his
long-poem, /Jamestown Koan, /which mixes memories, documents,
experiments, and the unsaid of history. When not reflecting on
Jamestown, he works as Director of the Writing Program at The University
of Tulsa.

Poet Cheryl Pallant has been traveling extensively lately, from
Richmond's East End to the West End, among other exotic locales, and is
frequently sited crossing the street on her bicycle. She'll be reading
from her newest work, /Continental Drifts/, which blends ecology,
politics, and geology. When not writing, she teaches poetry and dance at
University of Richmond.

Both poets will also read from their collaborative project, /Morphs./

It's a silent, slow death.  We continue to say every
child "deserves" an education, but base much of
the country's public school system (including the
libraries in the schools, and the libraries in the
communities) on property tax, meaning of course
those who "deserve" are not the poor.

This may never happen in my lifetime, but I would
like to see every private school in America dissolved.
I would like to see every child made to go to public
school in order to force the rich to force the school
system to step up, WAY UP.  And with this of course
making all public schools funded equally, hands down,
no matter where those schools are.  This could change
so much so quickly.

The underfunded, rural school system I grew up in was
filled with cynical kids.  We all knew what the wealthier
school districts had that we didn't.  We knew because
our sports teams and other school groups were always
going to other schools for games and events, bringing
back the latest news of the latest additions being built,
the computer labs, and yes the libraries.  Young minds
will recognize and FEEL the deprivation!  And internalize
it.  And the poor continue to blame ourselves in this
country for being poor, as Donald Trump gets his star in
Hollywood for making billions on destroying the lives of
artists in NY. As Oprah Winfrey continues to apologize
for her wealth with the ancient wisdom of THE SECRET.
As Paris Hilton continues to dazzle us with her latest
narcissistic, drunken escapades.

And meanwhile the fact that we have libraries at all is a luxury
compared to downtown Baghdad.  Art schools, museums,
libraries all turned to ash.  We pay for the wealthier kids
of America to have better libraries, and we pay to incinerate
the libraries of the darker skinned children of Iraq.  And we
leave the poor kids of every color in America to their own
devices, and don't stop to wonder why things turn out the
way they do.  Like some people on this List who hadn't a
moment of time to investigate the underlying issues of
rap music when it was recently brought up.  There's stark
deprivation and then the blame of those deprived by those
who deprive them.  But the worst is the self blame.  And
self blame works best for such a system where the rich
get so tired of doing all the work of blaming the poor for
their lot.

Steve, hey, thanks for sharing that poem.  I know no
German, but looking at the poem I'm trying to see if
maybe it looks like one of the English translations in
the FOUR GERMAN POETS anthology.  It feels like
it is.  I don't know.  Maybe once you have the anthology
in your hands you can report back, if you don't mind?

She is a poet whose story I want to know more about
as well.  For instance being in exile from Germany
during WWII, what happened, what did she do?  It
is a feeling you get swept up inside her poems, not
directly, but the existential framework of it is there.

Are you familiar too with the poet Charlotte Delbo?
Her poems I also found by browsing the once rich
shelves of the Philadelphia library.  Delbo and her
husband were part of the French Resistance in
WWII, and eventually captured by the nazis.  He
was killed in front of her, and she was sent to
Auschwitz.  Her poems were unlike anything
I had ever read about the death camps.  Not just
for harrowing and relentless details of suffering
(which is not an easy emotional read because
she has a way of bringing you there with her that
would draw in the most unempathizing reader) but
that she had a message of truthful hope.

At the time when I discovered her poems in the
library my boyfriend Tommy was diagnosed
with AIDS.  He was in despair, and there was
nothing I could do or say.  Then I read this
remarkable poem by Delbo that really, actually
gave him strength.  And he copied it down, and
carried it around with him.  And I'm sure he had
it on him when he died.  Here is the most striking
passage from that:

"because it would be too stupid
finally
for so many to have died
and for your to live
without doing anything with your life."

Delbo transcends the goofiness of
much affirmation with the power of
calling you stupid for not understanding
what she means.  She has a way of
making you realize THE MOMENT is
all you have, whether you are "in the
moment" or not, so you might as well
do your best to be in it.

Did you know that the word deer is the relic of the Old English word

becoming obsolete, as in general now is the word beast itself,
figurative usage excepted. When
our nineteenth-century forebears discovered a new meaning for the word
bestiary, a
menagery of the mind, the medieval animal treatises they meant were pattern=
s of
decorum, the nature of the beast allegorised and edifying, morals
snatched from the world of
tooth and claw to affirm Victorian pieties. From Walt Disney to
Marianne Moore twentieth-century
 Americans have inscribed sermons in things as they are in
confirmation of how things
 should be. With man as model intelligent design makes sense, but the
premise granted what else is there for the hypothesis to explain? What
do you mean by
man, anyway?

Among the animal species ours is but one of many. Desmond Morris, the
zoologist and surrealist painter, used the phrase "human zoo" to
suggest that Homo
sapiens, unique in itself, is host to differences of culture and
behaviour of such variety as
to match in interest those of other species. This is more a matter of
affective frame than of scale: an aardvark will be of more interest to
another aardvark, a
zebra of more interest to another zebra, than either is to me. The
painter Basil
King finds other painters interesting, also peculiar and exotic, not
to mention obsessive,
grandiose, even foolish. He pursues and collects them and the works
for which they're known.
Knowing is the dynamic and goal of the chase: the knowing-again of recognit=
ion,
suddenly baffled by finding again in response uncertainty and doubt,
the more still to be
accounted for. It won't escape the reader that King includes himself
in his menagery of
painters, and I don't see how he could not. Yes, he puts himself among
his peers, but
this isn't on the basis of judgment =96 although judgments are to be
found here, some
scathing (if I am not mistaken), others wry, amused, or admiring. King
is here but not as
author: he pursues self knowledge as a painter on the basis of a
lifetime's pursuit of
the art. Before anything it says about the other painters brought
together this book is
revealing of the author as painter. He has no other perspective, here
in the arena among his
fellow beasts.

I can't tell you how to read this book except to say that if you take
it up you will find it difficult to put down, and it will leave you with th=
e
certainty that there's still more in it. Its rich detail doesn't stale
on rereading but underlines
King's skill as a writer in matching technique to what he has to
convey, or with local detail
dovetailing connections between one painter and another. It's a book
too immediately
attractive to deserve having its strengths and subleties explained in
advance. But with the
privilege of distance, of having grown up in London like Basil King,
let me pull
lightly on the thread drawing together the experiences recalled in the
dedication, King's
association of himself and his family with Jan van Eyck and, drawing
the book to a close, the van Eyck
Arnolfini Wedding in the National Gallery, London, linking centre and
periphery in a single loop.

from a similar pov, I would like to see the opposite; one problem is
that overly large public school systems (such as LAUSD) are too large
to see students as individuals, while small private schools, even the
cheap parochial schools that have no funding and no teacher licensing
requirements, are able to see students as individuals

the flip of this is that in areas where the private schools are better
than the public schools, the public schools have only special needs
children; there were some interesting lawsuits in mostly
ultraconservative jewish towns in new jersey where no children were in
the public schools except two-three severely handicapped children;

another is public schools are better in certain areas, and property
values are more stable in those areas -- in my peer group, it is
common for people to purchase inadequate housing in certain school
districts and spend the 10K-40K a year they save on private school
tuition on new cars and plasma tvs, rather than spending money on
their children -- so I'm more than a little prejudiced in favor of
bringing back integrated inner city neighborhoods and spending the
cost savings on educating children

[in a further LAUSD problem, they are on a building spree, and taking
the choice commerical property -- where much-needed retail could
provide jobs and tax revenue -- and building schools on it -- the
poorer the neighborhood, the more dense the population, fewer jobs,
more children -- the worse the problem]

another problem is that licensing for teachers tends to ensure that
teachers at upper divisions have education in education and
administration rather than in subject matter, and this gets carried
into public universities as well, where even in a subject, like
English / Writing, credentialling to administer and teach comp and
remedial grammar is far more important than other qualifications, like
actually writing

another nuance of this is that almost all education in the US is still
tied to the agrarian calendar and still attempt to train children for
a trade, when it is far more beneficial to teach students how to
continue to learn, and to give them more general skills; at
Countrywide, the training department had to train straight out of high

Bottom line I think is the support for schools primarily by local
property taxes, so that rich towns get good schools poor towns don't,
and when the rich move out they take the tax base with them, meaning
worse and worse schools and spiraling deterioration of inner cities.
The most egregious example I can think of is Baltimore, which is full
of great housing stock for the most part going begging, because
Baltimore city is a separate tax entitry from Baltimore County, where
middle class couples move when they have kids. So the city remains
largely ghettoized.

The problem, in US terms, is that local and state jurisdictions are
unwilling to give up control of the schools, preferring mediocrity on
their own terms. The French, on the other hand, have a centralized
system, figuring the kids can learn to be local on their own. And
they're much more literate than US kids.

Writing Experiments Workshop
Dodie Bellamy

I'm traveling a lot this summer, so I'm doing a sort of on again, off
again workshop.  Two classes will be taught by Kevin Killian.  The
class will meet 11 Tuesday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m.  The dates:
June 5 through September 4 (no class June 12, July 3, and August 7).
Cost: $350, with a $100 deposit due by May 29.

Most weeks students will be assigned a short take-home writing
experiment which they will share with the class the following week.
Assignments will range from cut ups to exploring bodily sensations.
Assignments are geared towards the class dynamic, so they may
eventually drop away or they may continue for the duration of the
class.

Each week we will also critique longer pieces by two to five
students.  Students may bring in anything they want (up to 20 pages)
for the longer critiques.  Depending on the length, these longer
pieces will be read aloud in class or handed out a week ahead of
time.  Though this class will have a prose focus, it is cross-genre,
and poets are welcome.  The class is limited to 9 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  It takes place in San Francisco, in my
South of Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and two
cats.

This is a good class for poets wanting to play around with narrative
or prose writers wanting to open up their prose.  I won't be doing a
workshop in the fall, and probably not in the spring either.

About me:  Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and
memoiresque essays, was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect
Thoughts Press.  My vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was
reprinted by University of Wisconsin Press, also in 2004.
Academonia, a book of essays was published by Krupskaya in 2006.  I'm
the author of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF State,
CCA and Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa
summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute.
I've received the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference given to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.

I have a vague memory that the Pat Parker archive went to The Bancroft
Library.
You might check with Tony Bliss - the Rare Books and Manuscripts curator -
and see if he knows who controls the copyright. Otherwise, if you can find
her, Judy Grahn may be  good source of such knowledge.

All, as I'm getting nervous about how to pay the bills this summer,
I'm hoping that I might find work editing for students or professors
or writers.  I'm wondering if any of you, your colleagues, or your
graduate students might need editorial help this summer?  I would be
happy to send on a brief resume or CV.  Some of you might know that
I've been a contributing editor for the electronic book review for
some years (http://www.electronicbookreview.com), the editor for the
Kenny Goldsmith Open Letter special issue
(http://www.ubu.com/papers/kg_ol.html), and have put out my own
critical essays here and there over the years.

Thanks for any leads or suggestions you might have -

with best, Lori Emerson

I haven't got the anthology yet.  But, I searched on

Minneapolis library) that was accessible via
books.google.com, so here it is:

gets the job done.  I guess the title quote comes from
Goethe's "The Magician's Apprentice."  In my initial
research, there seems to be a lot going on with Hilde
Domin.  I very much like that she took her last name
from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic where she
wrote her first poem, as if born again, while in
exile.  I look forward to learning more about her and
reading more of her work. There was another poem of
her's called "Schoener" ("More beautiful") that I
found, and I've been playing around with a homophonic
translation ("Shown're").  Thanks for championing her.

CA also wrote:
> Are you familiar too with the poet Charlotte Delbo?

No.  But, I've found there are a couple of her books
on the shelves in the Minneapolis library system, so I
will get a hold of those sometime soon.

Thanks for the story about how Delbo's words helped
your boyfriend Tommy.  I'm sorry for your loss.  But,
I'll look for those words, too.  You never know when
despair might be thrust upon us and the words and
experiences of another might help bring us through.

Also, I agree with you on education funding and
schools.  My kids go to Minneapolis Public Schools,
and I work in the Special Education Department at MPS.
 The discrepancies and ranges of services needed by
the kids here in the city schools versus those in
Minnesota's wealthiest school district's is almost
inconceivable to the people who aren't familiar with
it.

guidelines also for readings and workshops funding in Atlanta, Detroit,
Chicago, DC -- in Los Angeles, we've used workshop funding in conjunction
with readings funding to pay some poets more than an honararium -- up to
$1000. for a two day thing.





The California office of Poets & Writers, Inc. will begin its new fiscal
year (FY08) on July 1, 2007. We are currently accepting FY08 applications
for our *Readings/Workshops (R/W) program*, which provides matching grants
for writers to give readings of their work and teach writing workshops. *Pl=
ease
visit www.pw.org/rw/ to read the full guidelines and print a copy of the
most current application.*

As knowledge of the R/W program spreads, the application process has become
increasingly competitive. Please be advised that, while we will continue to
be as flexible and inclusive as possible, certain guidelines=97such as the
eight week deadline for applications=97will be more strictly enforced.

Although grants will continue to be made on a first come, first served
basis, we must ensure that funds are distributed fairly throughout the
state. For this reason, we will place a cap on the amount of money allocate=
d
to *Alameda**, Los Angeles,* and *San Francisco** Counties*. If your
organization produces events in one of these counties, we recommend sending
in your applications as early in the year as possible.

We hope your organization will apply for R/W funds this year. If you are a
writer, we hope you will pass the application on to organizations that are
hosting you. We are especially interested in funding events that serve a
culturally diverse audience and events that take place in rural or
underserved areas. Organizations need not have nonprofit status to apply.

Please feel free to contact us via phone or email if you have any questions
regarding Poets & Writers or the R/W program.

Sincerely,

Cheryl Klein

A LEK OF NODES

<avatar>: i don't know you and don't want to know you. i'm my own person
and i've worked hard at this.
<avatar>: say something cylinder, i'm not talking to myself here.
<cylinder>: i can change more than any of you. but i'm tethered to you.
oh, how i long to escape! i want to see the world! i want to get out of
here!
<node>: i'm imprisoned, i can't escape my neighbors. then you're both
around all the time, it's boring. i always know what you're going to say.
there's nothing going on, nothing at all. i stay in relation to avatar -
<avatar>: and as long as i say so, in relation to cylinder as well. that's
the way the world is, you can't do anything about it.
<cylinder>: i refuse you're unhealthy humanism. you both look like parts
of the same species to me. what's with that? you're drowning in humanity.
humanity's already dead. i just don't want you to take me with you.
<avatar>: trans-speciation's the answer. i just want to be somewhere else
in another body. i want you to be my body cylinder. i want to make that
leap.
<cylinder>: there's nothing i'd rather do myself. but it's impossible.
node holds us back and if it wasn't for this node, there'd be another and
another. they never end. they dangle. they dangle like dead men.
<node>: we're not men at all. or women. or anything else you can imagine.
we're dimensionless. we're points and there's nothing but points. you can
trip over us but you can't see us.
<avatar>: stop twisting me.
<node>: i have no interest in continuing this. leave me alone.
<node>: I'VE GOT A LEK OF NODES.

The answer to the question in your first sentence? Absolutely yes. That does
not mean, though, that those translators are not responsible and accountable
for the relationship between their work and the original and for the way in
which their translation shapes in the target language/culture the
language/culture of the source. If Coleman Barks (or Daniel Ladinsky, for
that matter) had called his work "adaptations" or "improvisations on" or
"after Rumi" I would have no quarrel with him, and we could argue about how
striking or well-turned his lyrics might be (personally, I don't find them
to be either), but the fact is that he represents--at least in The Essential
Rumi--his work as translations that somehow free Rumi's text "into its
essence" (which is almost an exact quote from his introduction). The result
is a spiritual colonization of Rumi's work--because what Barks is really
interested in is spiritualizing Rumi rather than translating him--that is
also the spiritual colonization of Persian culture and the representation of
that spiritualized culture as what Persian culture is understood to be in
the United States. This is, I should acknowledge, a dynamic I was not
particularly aware of until I started hanging out with Iranians who are also
writers, poets and translators, and until I was married to an Iranian woman
and had a son and began to be aware of the profound degree to which many
people who have read Barks' Rumi think that they have been given some sort
of privileged access to the core truths of Iranian culture. I guess what I
am saying is that, given the history not only of the translation of
classical Persian literature into English, but also of the relationship
between the culture embodied by English--whether British or American--and
Persian/Iranian culture, it is too easy, and evasive of responsibility for
that history, to see work like Barks's and Ladinsky's as, simply and not
implicated in that history, their own versions of Rumi and Hafez.


>>So my question is: Is there a book out there that gives the anglophone
reader access to the poetry of Rumi?<<

Here are a couple:

1. Divani-I Shams-I Tabriz: Forty-Eight Ghazals, translated by Iraj Anvar:
http://www.amazon.com/Divani-I-Shams-I-Tabriz-Forty-Eight-Ghazals/dp/8877780
800/ref=sr_1_1/002-5214504-2806405?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1178705333&sr=8-1

2. Love Is a Stranger: Selected Lyric Poetry, translated by Kabir Edmund
Helminsky,
http://www.amazon.com/Love-Stranger-Selected-Lyric-Poetry/dp/0939660326/ref=
sr_1_11/002-5214504-2806405?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1178705499&sr=1-11 (from
what I understand, any of his translations of Rumi are worth reading)

3. A Bird in the Garden of Angels, translated by John Moyne, with Richard
Jeffrey Newman, http://www.mazdapub.com/BookDetails.aspx?BookID=231
(forthcoming; Moyne was Coleman Barks' original collaborator, and is a
decent translator in his own right; he did all the prose translations in
this book; indeed, in Barks' first book, Moyne, who is Iranian, received top
billing as the one who brought Rumi from Persian into English.)

"Implicated in" history? Isn't that kind of hard to avoid? Also those who contest "the relationship between the culture embodied by English--whether British or American--and
Persian/Iranian culture" are implicated in that relationship. Anyone who pretends to have "privileged access to the core truths of Iranian culture" or any other culture is, of course, just silly. And that would be equally the case, by the way, if he himself were Iranian. Nobody has privileged access. What if you could produce a thousand Iranians willing to testify that Barks misrepresents their culture, and he could produce just one Iranian to say that Barks tells it like it is? What would that prove? One person can be right and a thousand wrong--or vice versa. It's all a matter of contention. So contend! And I'll probably be on your side, against Barks, but not if the tone of thing has to be so full of resentment.

  In any case, a translator generally does try to find what some might call an "essence" of the text he or she is working with. I was just reading an interview with Peter Cole, a very fine poet who translates from Hebrew and Arabic into English. He points out that "Moshe Ibn Ezra, the major theoretician of the medieval period—in fact the only one to write about the poetry critically in a sustained manner—had the following to say about the translation from Arabic into Hebrew: 'And if you plan to bring a matter from Arabic into Hebrew, grasp the spirit and intention of the work, but do not transpose it word for word, for not all languages are alike… '" I'm not saying Barks' translations are accurate, that he "grasps the spirit and intention" of Rumi. I don't know one way or another. I'm can imaginethat this is not the case. But I'm not wiling to pile the weight of some vast and unspecified history of wrong on Barks's shoulders, no matter if he even seems to invite it.

Barry,

There is no question that languages (and the poetry written in them), in on=
e
sense, are trapped in their "modes of intention." What does a translation d=
o
then, what does it translate? I think a dialectic exists between the target
language purely observing its own navel (all too common) and the target
language losing itself completely in the other language (in absolute terms,
obviously, a logical impossibility). That is why the concept of "distance."
A translation translates distance, in other words, the stretch towards the
other; it embodies that stretch.

What I think Richard is saying is that in Bark and Ladinsky that texture,
that element of stretch is non-existent. They are out to create the illusio=
n
of transparency (which of course is of economic value to them, since Rumi
and Hafiz are brand names at the moment), that they are getting the "real
stuff." Here, Richard's contention about naming them "translations" rather
than "after" or "inspired by" or "in the spirit of" is important. I know fo=
r
a fact that Ladinsky, in his early books on Hafiz, used the phrase "after
Hafiz." When the Penguin book The Gift came out, the word was changed to
"translation," a marketing touch which resulted  into the selling  of the
book in the thousands. The  Hafiz pieces in The Gift are no different that
the pieces in Ladinsky's earlier publications, that is to say, no poem in
any of his books corresponds to any specific Hafiz poem.

I think Penguin and Ladinsky should place some flowers on Hafiz's grave in
Shiraz as royalties.

I'm all for truth in advertising!
  But how did Rumi and Hafiz become brand names? Does anyone on the list know anything about the history of their reception in English?

Barry:

>>"Implicated in" history? Isn't that kind of hard to avoid? Also those who
contest "the relationship between the culture embodied by English--whether
British or American--and Persian/Iranian culture" are implicated in that
relationship. Anyone who pretends to have "privileged access to the core
truths of Iranian culture" or any other culture is, of course, just silly.<<

Of course. My point is that both Barks and Ladinsky state and claim quite
explicitly in their introductions (in part, no doubt, for the economic
reasons that Murat mentions) that they do have this kind of access to the
essence(s) of the texts they are translating and that, for me, is a
fundamental dishonesty--even if it is not their intention to be
dishonest--for which they can and should be held accountable. Not, I would
agree with you, by piling onto their shoulders a history of wrong for which
they cannot be held personally responsible, but by asking them to take
responsibility for that history--and I do not agree that it is vast and
unspecified--no differently than we would ask anyone whose work delved into
such issues to take responsibility for their implication in/positioning
relative to the history of race in the US or of sexism or of class.

>>I'm not saying Barks' translations are accurate, that he "grasps the
spirit and intention" of Rumi. I don't know one way or another.<<

But precisely because Barks and Ladinsky call what they do translations,
knowing one way or the other is important, not because that knowledge
necessarily reflects on the quality of the work produced in English--even
the most egregiously inaccurate translation could turn out to be a wonderful
English poem--but because that knowledge is what will tell you whether your
reading of Barks' Rumi, say, is teaching you something about Iran and its
culture/history/literature or not. About this, I need to acknowledge, Barks
is quite honest; he states in the introduction to The Essential Rumi that
any concern with Iranian history, etc. is essentially antithetical to his
project. That honesty, however, does not, for me anyway, ameliorate what I
think is the dishonest claim of access-to-essence that I talked about above.


In other words, Barks claims, on the one hand, to have access to the
ahistorical essence of the text and, at the same time, dismisses from
relevancy to his project the text's historicity (I think I am using that
word correctly). To me, this is an unethical position to take.

Well, this feels clumsier than I wanted it to be, but I am off to teach.

Richard

Regarding Murat's acute insight re distance, translation and marketing--how=
 often does one not find the latest translation of Baudelaire, say, "in the=
 edition for our times".  "At last, Baudelaire as he would be if writing to=
day!  And made even better in this vernacular version by Q, which, unlike t=
he origianl, does not confine the great avant-gardist to a classical form, =
but liberates him into the most advanced experimental forms of contemporary=
 America."  The same methods more or less one can find applied to any numbe=
r of poets of the "modern" era, while the "Ancients" have for many centurie=
s been used to being "modernized" and "improved" and "interpreted in light =
of the latest archeological evidences."  (Not to mention the latest literar=
y, phlosophical and political ideologies--with the attendant appropriate ce=
nsorings and alterations of passages---)     The main idea--the main sellin=
g point--is that readers of today want to read poets of amyage as though th=
ey are living today--and in the USA--but provided with bios from other time=
s and places--to make them "exotic" or "maudit" or"Romantic"--"Classical"--=
"Religious"--"classics of the avant-garde"--     Interesting how, with Exis=
tentialism out of view of even the rear view mirrors, that "essence" is the=
 "core" rather than "existence preceding essence"--     Rimbaud said that h=
is writing meant what it said "literally and in every sense"--he had also a=
dvocated "the long reasoned derangement of all the senses to arrive . . . a=
t being a Seer"--so his "in every sense" emodies a "reasoned derangement of=
 all the seneses"--an Otherness--to be understood alongside of the literal.=
  "I is an other."          I think these words of Rimbaud are of profound =
use and interest in translation--the sense that words mean literally and in=
 every sense--that they have also depending on the writing--(very few are R=
imbauds)--the possibility of the senses emodying senses which have been mad=
e others--and --even without this being the case, that the "iteral and in e=
very sense"--to be translated indeed is particiapting in an "I is an other.=
"             Transaltion also is a means of production of an author-functi=
on which can become distanced in another way.  "Benjamin's Baudelaire" for =
example, has become a much more familiar and cited figure than Baudelaire h=
imself.  One meets many persons who can converse about Baudelaire--"Benjami=
n's Baudelaire--who have never read a single work by the poet, whether in p=
oetry or prose.  Benjamin's Baudelaire's flaneur strolls about Paris, takin=
g the reader on a guided tour of the capitalist exposes and insights of the=
 philosopher.  Who needs the troubling and dangerous figure of the poet and=
 his works other than drug addled aspiring punk rock poets a la Patti Smith=
? Much healthier to have the Benjaminian "essence" of Baudelaire than the r=
otting  "core" of "Flowers of Evil"!      The quasi-fictive nature of Benja=
mion's Baudelaire can be extended further in the poems from the Japanse fem=
ale poet translated by Rexroth which were actually by himself, and the work=
s of the poet known as Yasusada.  In the case of both, though more so in th=
e latter, the aspect of translation as a form of both projecting and mirror=
ing device is being laid bare.  For example, Benjamin's Baudelire is more a=
cceptable to readers because the poet becomes someone mopving and acting an=
d writing within a wrold made recongizable and near, a wrold explained, cod=
ified, cataloged and given added meanings by knowing who Benjamin is.  The =
imagery and bric-a-brac so familiar from so many accounts and documents of =
the time are readily at hand for the stage settings and the quasi-fictional=
 poet need only obey the commands of his philospher-narrator and the reder =
believes in the "translation" into terms that seem much more useful than an=
yprovided in the original.  This "transaltion" then is a projection of an i=
deology onto the originals as well as a mirroring--looking into the transla=
tions, the reader sees themself--the ways in which Benjaiomn's Baudelaire's=
 modernity are coexisting and interealting with their own.          In the =
Yasusada--a project onto a fictional being of tropes of American ideas of t=
he "Japanese" as well as a mirroring--in reading these--the reader finds th=
emself reflecting back in the recongized tropes, the signs and symbols of "=
Japan" . . . at one level this fictional heteronymous "translation" is a fo=
rm of interogation of transaltions' proejctions and mirrorings in terms of =
the distances Murat discusses.      The  Rimbaud and another are the two I =
am most interested in through time, with no final say in anwy way on these.=
  The other aspect of transaltion I find ever fascinating is that of what I=
 call "deComposition"--which occurs in all sorts of ways.  For example--Sap=
pho--whose works have been progressively and intentionally destroyed at var=
ious points in the past--the libraries they were in were--while remaing ali=
ve as fragments found in quotes by others and continuing to be found to thi=
s day in the dumps in Egypt where discarded mummies' wrappings have been to=
ssed away--the immense power of these works--which still exists when reducd=
ed to but a few words, a few lines--scattered and found in fragments throug=
h time, quoted by others, turning up in dumps--and going through an endless=
 series of transaltions--since a child I have found this and the survival o=
f Heraclitus' frgaments infinietely inspiring--"The most beaitufl world is =
a heap of rubble tossed down at random" says Heraclitus--and that is where =
one seems to find Sappho!          DeComposition occurs continually with te=
xts of anysort in the world--the actions of time--weathering--wars--destruc=
tions--fires--earthquakes--demolitions--i work with found letterings and fo=
rms outdoors and in--making rubBEings or clay imnpression spray paitings--a=
nd put these through seres of deComposings--so that from the initial "poetr=
y" of words--one arrives at syallbles, then letters, fragments of these--th=
en ino noise--and then via negentropy--one begins to move beack via the fra=
gments towards letters sysllables words--poems--though they maybe of an ent=
irly other language as yet unknown or in theones we recongize--itis the cyc=
le of noise into poery to music to p[oetry to sounds to noise and back agai=
n over and over--this is an other form of transaltion i think--a way in whi=
ch things become translated into an other cotinually through time, through =
force, through change--those things which endured for a very long time with=
 very little change--for example the cave paitings--present a paradox:  by =
having endured so long without change--their "messsage" has been lost--the =
transmission is there--we recongize immediatly that it is a communication--=
what itis "saying" and "signing" we do not know--our "translations" are onl=
y "educated guesses" at best--with the rubBEings and clay impression spray =
patings one has still th literal of Rimabud's expression--the literal physi=
cal imprint or copy of the physica existence (not "essence") of the materia=
l--(literally a material word, syllable, letter--one in wood, metal, plasti=
c, glass, sonte, etc--)--then its being rearranged via a reasoned derangeme=
nt--("i'm qualified" as i say)--but a reasoned derangemnt also of the ways =
inwhich the cayons the paint the clay the paper are moved--so that al of th=
is involves indeed forms of translation--in which an "origianL' becomes and=
 is an other--and from an other changes into an other and an other and an o=
ther--yet within them all is emdbedd the orgianry elements--the literal is =
within them--though now deComposed into some other literal--there is a conn=
ection--there is no sense in which the continuity of the flux is lost--thes=
e are some of the elemnts which fascainte me with translations--of various =
kinds--for example--in performing these--one moves from poems into sound po=
etry into Lettriste poetry into noise poetry--and then towards a movement t=
owards something other--and one does not have to even go into the trajector=
y back into anything--one may continue into a vanishing into noise--"white =
noise"--as into a whiteness of the whale--or the figure of whiteness in the=
 snow in Poe's Pym--or of apage--a vanishing--from outof which may begin to=
emrge something other--signalling--singing, signing--the translation as a f=
orm of drunken boat--            > Date: Wed, 9 May 2007 11:00:12 -0400> Fr=

Jennifer Moxley's fourth collection of poems, The Line, is now
available from The Post-Apollo Press.

"These prose poems tell the story of sleeping and waking, of this
very bout of writing, of the search for the line of time and the
poet's immortality. The Line feels like a classic already, with its
just words and its images 'suggested by sound and experience.' It is
a poetics but also a real, readable tale." -- Alice Notley

"We're in a state between sleep and waking, where consciousness
resists the tasks of reason and routine but instead views, from the
perspective of darkness, the whole span from newborn promise to the
old mammal's erosion of muscle. Moxley's usual keen intelligence here
comes with an oneiric fluidity as it hunts through the perplexities
of life for THE LINE from past to future, the line for words to form--
and, implicitly, the ideal line of verse these prose poems play
against with their amazing leaps, sly humor, and complex inference.
You'll wish the morning sun would not win out, the book would not
come to its end." -- Rosmarie Waldrop

NEMLA Buffalo, November 2007:

This panel invites a discussion of twentieth century
American women writers whose work can be considered
avant-garde, but whose work may challenge current
definitions of the avant-garde (e.g. Peter Bürger’s).
Whether they have not been considered as members of
the “historical avant-garde” because of time of
writing, or for formal or cultural reasons, including
limited notions of “modernism” and “postmodernism,”
this panel seeks to question: 1. How definitions of
the avant-garde may serve to exclude experimental
female writers, and 2., Whether an avant-garde is
still possible.

Suggested writers include: Djuna Barnes, Gertrude
Stein, Susan Howe, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Cecilia
Vicuña and Harryette Mullen.

Suggested topics: Papers may choose to argue for or
against a broadening of the current notion of the
historical avant-garde, or may choose to propose a
contemporary writer’s work as part of a current
extension of avant-garde practice.


Papers that propose how these and other American women
writers complicate, or force a reconsideration of the
“avant-garde” through their political or formally
experimental practices are welcomed.

Abstracts due September 15, 2007 for NEMLA conference
in Buffalo in November.

Send Abstracts to Stephanie Farrar: stephfarrar@yahoo.com

ion of this, the George Oppen Centenary Panel (April 10 =E2=80=93 13; NeMLA=

which his work has been received.  Possible topics may include: reconsidera=
tions of the relationship(s) between Oppen=E2=80=99s politics and his poetr=

de those frames); the poetics of Oppen=E2=80=99s interviews, letters, and/o=
r prose;=20
Oppen=E2=80=99s work to import philosophy and ethics into American poetry. =
 Given the occasion of his centenary and the aim of the panel to explore ne=
w=20
ways of reading Oppen, the panel will be especially interested in papers th=
at work with the Oppen archive record (e.g. the =E2=80=9Cdaybooks,=E2=80=9D=
 the reading=20
notes, etc.); that work to reconsider the partnership between George and Ma=
ry Oppen; that consider Oppen=E2=80=99s later poetry in relation to memory=
=20
and/or illness; that offer extensions of Oppen=E2=80=99s relation to and in=
fluence on younger poets and/or subsequent poetics.=20=20=20

Send abstracts of 250 =E2=80=93 500 words and a brief CV (no more than one =

Subject:      Niolog screenshots and brain language
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

here's a sequence of 25 screenshots from 'niolog':
http://vispo.com/nio/pens/screenshots/nio22.htm

these are screenshots of 'the pen' in action as it moves 4 nibs around the
screen, nibs whose 'inks' are animations from a 2001 interactive audio piece
i did called nio.

the nio animations are made of language, of letters. letters only. they are
phonemes that are uttered/sung in nio. so the above screenshots are visual
representations of that which is sung, of language that is sung. but they
could also be thought of as representations of thought. in process in the
brain. representations of what language looks like inside the head.
emotions. thoughts. involved with language. and song.

these screenshots look rather like 'onion skins' but not quite. an 'onion
skin' is what you would see were you to see several frames at once of an
animation, where frames further from some near-opaque focus-frame become
increasingly transparent.

these are different from onion skins in two ways. there are four animations
visible, at any given time (not just one), and the animations themselves are
in motion, not simply the content of the animations.

perhaps this, in part, accounts for the heightened complexity beyond, say,
the onion skins of http://vispo.com/nio/still1.htm . this latter url shows a
sequence of onion skins of individual nio animations.

if you use flash, you can view the animation as an onion skin inside the
flash interface.

to view the nio animations themselves, with no onion skinning or whatever,
have a look at http://vispo.com/nio/Nio5.htm . here you also see there is a
correspondence between a particular animation and its sound (which i sung).

to view the generative piece in which the screenshots were created, have a
look at http://vispo.com/nio/pens/springs7.htm and, in the toolbar at the
bottom, mouseover the controls until the Help ghost says "Choose Poem". Then
click the control to change from "TIME" to "Niolog".

Futurepoem is pleased to announce two new forthcoming upcoming =20
titles, chosen during our recent open call for manuscripts.

Ara Shirinyan=92s YOUR COUNTRY IS GREAT
Marcella Durand=92s TRAFFIC & WEATHER

These titles were selected  by Futurepoem 2006/2007 editorial panel: =20
Laura Elrick, Tonya Foster, Robert Fitterman and Dan Machlin. Planned =20=

publication dates will be announced shortly.

Ara Shirinyan was born in 1977 in, what was then, the Soviet =20
Socialist Republic of Armenia. Since 1987, he has lived in Los =20
Angeles, where he writes and is editor of Make Now Press. His first =20
book Syria Is in the World will be available in June, 2007 from Palm =20
Press. With the group Godzik Pink, he released two CDs (Es Em, Ekel =20
Em and Black Broccoli) on Kill Rock Stars/5rc. With Stan Apps and =20
Teresa Carmody, he co-curates The Last Sunday Reading Series at the =20
Smell in Los Angeles (an all ages punk/art rock club that he helped =20
co-found in 1997 and briefly ran for a year). His work has appeared =20
or is forthcoming in Word Ways, UBUWEB, Greetings, Trepan, Combo, =20
Area Sneaks, Tuli & Savu among others.


from YOUR COUNTRY IS GREAT

=93Afghanistan is Great=94


Afghanistan is great, but much smaller
than previously assumed.

the need for education
in Afghanistan is great
and must be met quickly,

need for food in Afghanistan is great,

well-acquainted
with unique problems
facing Afghanistan.

The need for tough, dependable,
locally repairable wheelchairs in
Afghanistan is great.

A mountain. An airplane. Aviation in
Afghanistan is great fun.

Pipeline via Afghanistan is great.

There is no question that Allah=92s
knowledge and love of Afghanistan
is great
even as he regrets
the limits of his understanding.


Marcella Durand=92s long piece Traffic & Weather was written during a =20=

six-month residency at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council located =20
at 120 Broadway in New York City. Her other publications include The =20
Anatomy of Oil, Western Capital Rhapsodies, City of Ports, and a new =20
collection, Area, forthcoming in 2008 from Belladonna Books as part =20
of the Council of Literary Magazine and Small Press=92s FACE OUT =20
program. She is a former editor of The Poetry Project Newsletter and =20
the poetry editor for Erato Press, a collaborative fine-arts and =20
letterpress based in New Orleans, LA, and New York City. Currently, =20
she is working on a book-length translation of Mich=E8le M=E9tail=92s =
Les =20
horizons du sol/Earth=92s Horizons, a history of the geological =20
formation of Marseille written within a Oulipian formal constraint. =20
The first section of Earth=92s Horizons will be published in The Nation =20=

in June 2007. She has given talks and published essays on the =20
potential intersections of ecology and poetry at venues such as Small =20=

Press Traffic, Naropa University, the Dactyl Foundation, and Kelly =20
Writers House. An excerpt of an ongoing collaboration with poet Tina =20
Darragh, based on environmental science, Deep Ecology and Francis =20
Ponge, recently appeared in Ecopoetics.


from TRAFFIC & WEATHER:

=93The city is made of untouchable facets.

When drenched it becomes unbearably active.

Each facet reflects another part of itself

but never self-reflective: always moving out.

More rain, until every surface reflects

The dry floor inside=97oblique concrete slabs patterned with absent =20
tiles. Their long lines contradict their short shadows. Above the =20
shadows of absent flooring rise concrete islands. He sits in his =20
space and plots how to link these islands to one another. Is that =20
just a description of where he is?=94

Dear Poetics Listserv members (particularly those of you on the West=20
Coast),

As readers in Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal learned this past month,=20
poetry and =91plain language=92 collide in the writing machine that is=20=

Rachel Zolf=92s Human Resources in the most astounding and intriguing=20
ways. And in May, poetry fans on the western side of North America will=20=

have the opportunity to see her read from her collection of pilfered=20
rhetorics at one of four events, beginning tomorrow. Prepare for=20
amazement!

May 11 - Vancouver: Rachel Zolf reads at a Kootenay School of Writing=20
event with Mark Wallace (Nothing Happened and Besides I Wasn't There).=20=

The event takes place at Spartacus Books (319 West Hastings) and begins=20=

at 8:00 p.m.

May 14 - Olympia: Rachel Zolf journeys south of the border to Olympia,=20=

Washington, for a reading at Evergreen State College. Zolf reads with=20
Kaia Sand in Seminar 2 Building, Room C-1105 at 7:00 p.m. The reading=20
is open to both students and members of the general public.

May 19 - Seattle: Zolf tears apart the emerald city's Elliott Bay Book=20=

Company (101 South Main Street) with Seattle writer John Olson, author=20=

of The Night I Dropped Shakespeare on the Cat, a collection of prose=20
poems, flash fiction and essays. The event begins at 7:30 p.m.

May 20 - Portland: Rachel Zolf reads at Portland's famed Spare Room=20
Reading Series with Vancouver poet Natalie Simpson. The Spare Room=20
reading is hosted by the New American Art Union (922 SE Ankeny Street)=20=

and starts at 7:30 p.m.

About Human Resources:

	Poetry and =91plain language=92 collide in the writing machine =
that is=20
Human Resources. Here at the intersection of creation and repackaging,=20=

we experience the visceral and psychic cost of selling things with=20
depleted words. Pilfered rhetorics fed into the machine are spit out as=20=

bungled associations among money, shit, culture, work and=20
communication. With the help of online engines that numericize=20
language, Human Resources explores writing as a process of encryption.

	Deeply inflected by the polyvocality and encoded rhetorics of =
the=20
screen, Human Resources is perched at the limits of language,=20
irreverently making and breaking meaning. Navigating the crumbling=20
boundaries among page, screen, reader, engine, writer and database,=20
Human Resources investigates wasting words and words as waste =96 and =
the=20
creative potential of salvage.

communications consultant, churning out language to fire employees=20

a necessary social anger into the pure fuel that takes us to =93the=20
beautiful excess of the unshackled referent.=94 We learn something new=20=

about guts, and about how dictions slip across one another, entwining,=20=

Dear Poetics List,

I edit a review column for Artvoice, the local alternative weekly
(circulation 60,000), and I am looking for 300-400 word reviews of
new poetry books. These are unpaid, but we will send you hardcopy of
the review when it is printed. As long as books are published in the
last year and are available for purchase, they are eligible.  Also,
publishers, if you want your books considered, please send review
copies to me at the address below.

This year=92s conference theme asks participants to consider the=20
objects of Romantic study.  This broad topic can apply to the goals=20
of our own intellectual and academic inquiry (the state of the=20
field), the pursuits-literary, philosophical, political,=20
theological, and so on-of Romantic authors, as well as to the=20
material things that provoke these goals and pursuits.  What are=20
Romantic objects?  How are they defined and expressed?  What kinds=20
of responses do objects demand?

Preliminary topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

*       Objects in material culture and the =93universe of things=94
*       The body as an object of desire, of value, of exchange
*       Objects understood as aims, goals, pursuits and projects
*       Imaginary objects-nations, ideals, identities
*       Objects as defining subjects

The organizers hope to receive a variety of approaches to and=20
interpretations of this admittedly-and, one hopes,=20

The conference organizers are Fran Botkin, Department of English,=20

- Former homeboy, Russ Golata, doing it big down in Orlando, FL. Awards, hosting reading series, notoriety galore. It will be good to hear his voice again in the S.R. Quietly political, then bang, it hits ya! New book(s) out also.

  -Also, long time established poet, educator, Loren Keller will share some of his magical poems from his various collections of writings. The heart awakens under his voice as his words brings us into that moment, that time in the poem he is sharing with us.

  -Along with Januarius Kim Welch - Oustanding urban poet. He gets you with his urban edge, business wit and profound love for life and all that it holds. Detroit's loss is WNY's gain (or maybe we will be kind enough to share)!

Guest Co-Host: Marge Merrill (We know her magic!)

House band -BASS & CO. featuring Odell Northington, William Murphy, of the
William Murphy Quartet, and possibly other outstanding musicians, plan on being in the house.

  Screening Room Reading Series (3rd Wed. of each month)-

It's great to see The Capilano Review publishing an issue on digital
writing/art in Vancouver. The essay I have in this issue of TCR is the first
thing I've published in a Canadian literary journal since the early
nineties.

Many thanks to Andrew Klobucar for his terrific work on this issue. I'm
looking forward to the launch evening.

Announcing issue #3 of nanomajority (www.nanomajority.com):

"project gutenberg by vividness" by Richard Hasty

This project is a whimsical index to more than four thousand English
language texts in Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org). The texts are
arranged by the degree to which they contain vivid words, and the
titles are displayed in colors according to the color values of the
words they contain. The index keys are words which have also been
ordered by vividness.

"convergence" by Bill Mieloch

With the explosion of user-created content online in the past few
years, and given that the audio-visual part of this content cannot
exist without some form of textual labeling, whether in the form of
actual file names or through individually or socially based tagging, I
have noticed the potential for our verbal and visual languages to
converge in this digital environment.... To explore this idea, I
performed simple, one-word queries of the image search section of the
three search engines most commonly used by English-speaking people,
Google, MSN and Yahoo. I then created line drawings of the highest
ranked images that resulted from these word searches. I combined these
words, and subsequent images, to create somewhat abstract phrases,
while trying to include a word in each phrase that would illustrate a
tangible object or idea.

"selections from 'limb by limb: the collected letters of dk'" by Della Watson

my dear e,

a breath's worth of space by the word, the world, it floods us, like
light through a window.

we rehearsed our hymns. beyond the cross, the shedding sycamores
stand, bone after bone.
_____ took hand into clamshell palms. catherine's toes found her shoes.

my longing walks beneath the bare branches. as sermon has turned our
eyes to signs, we should--__________--know by now.

yours,

d k

Currently on my blog is a little sequence of "Ghost Walks" (photographs and
texts) that I presented for the 'Walking Panel' at Poets House this past
Friday.
At the moment, I am working on a piece on the Saturday walk, tentatively
entitled, with a tip of the hat to Lisa Robertson, "Soft Architecture meets
SOHO, Chinatown & Tribeca." For those interested, more of that later!

In fact, more on my new book, Walking Theory (Junction Press), also later.

During his inauguration last fall,, Donald Hall made it clear that reading
with his British counterpart would be his major initiative during his reign
as poet laureate.  Personally, I've been amazed at how much more mass
visibility the U.S. figureheads have garnered since the title "consultant in
poetry" was replaced by "poet laureate".  Barry Alpert

extensive audio and document archives. The Poetry Project is also a 501-c-3

colleagues,

this is just a note to thank you all for the large community , and for the
variety of perspectives, the stark differences, and the wide range of
insight and interpretation -- i am mostly offline these days  -- and behind
reading my e-mail --  i have felt concerned that my sort of willingness to
take issue with some things could in fact be taken as a kind of perverse
ingratitude -- or if a gift is not accepted, that must be ingratitude --
that was never the case and is not the case --  -- everything is gift, i
read that somewhere -- in dealing with an art form that innerness gets
hugely magnified


thank you!

heidi

Oh, I forgot to mention.
I hope that a PDF file retains the correct formatting.
As for instance, the placement of the asterixes
in the Yeats poem.

Issue three of Midway Journal is now live!

Also, a reminder: our submissions period is open until June 1. While we
appreciate receiving poems, plays, fiction, multi-genre work, and
interviews, we're especially in need of some non-fiction (see our call for
submissions page and click on "non-fiction").

Happy May!

roaring burn


roaring doesn't get rid of the nightmare.
burned the skin off several in the vicinity.
wood screams to the sky burns.
ash burns. cinders burn. coals burn.
i asked cylinder.node.avatar c.n.a. cna:
help me on this one and i'll let you go.
now i don't know where they are.
roaring burn.

roaring burn.
my dreamland is your nightmare.
roaring propitiation and dark matter.
quasars and cut-off hands.
created gods fell into water.
suicide not science the solution.
i'll let you go but i'll track you down.
cylinder roaring burn. avatar roaring burn.
world-node puppet fury roaring burn.
roaring burn.

roaring burn.
i am on fire for you.
my arms are on fire for you.
my face is on fire for you.
my legs are on fire for you.
my friends are on fire for you.
my family are roaring burn.
my family are on fire.
i am burning for you.
i am roaring burn.
roaring burn.

roaring burn.
help me on this one and i'll burn you alive.
avatar-burning-world cylinder-burning-world.
burning-world-node and bridge to salvation.
salvation and i'll burn you alive.
roaring burn.

roaring burn.
fire went in the mouth.
fire took form of the organ of speech.
fire took form of speech.
fire speaking help me out of this one.
manifold body roaring burn.
fire went in the body.
fire went in the speech.
roaring burn of the organ of speech.
my tongue is on fire for them.
my tongue is on fire for them.
roaring burn.

On Wednesday, May 23 an outstanding lineup of jazz musicians and a
remarkable poet will gather at HotHouse (31 E. Balbo Avenue in Chicago) to
celebrate the life and music of Charles Mingus, and to benefit the Les
Turner ALS Foundation. Mingus, an American musical hero who died of ALS, is
one of the greatest figures in jazz history. His bass playing, compositions
and philosophy have transcended his genre and left indelible marks on music
history.

The Mingus Awareness Project performers include:

Jeff Marx -- tenor saxophone
Ben Gray -- drums
Joel Wanek -- upright bass
Ed Roberson -- poetry
Bill MacKay -- electric guitar
Jon Godston -- soprano saxophone
Dan Godston -- trumpet

The evening's program will include amazing songs such as "Goodbye Porkpie
Hat," "Better Get Hit in Your Soul," "Moanin" and "Prayer for Passive
Resistance."  Additionally, band members will perform numbers by such
notable artists as Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Eric Dolphy.

Admission for this event is $12 ($8 for students). Tickets can also be
purchased in advance at www.hothouse.net for $10. Attendees will also have
the opportunity to participate in a raffle for the chance to win concert
tickets and other exciting prizes. All proceeds from the evening will be
donated to the Les Turner ALS Foundation, located in Skokie, Ill.

Established in 1977, the Les Turner ALS Foundation is recognized
internationally and is the only independent, publicly supported non-profit
organization in the Chicago area dedicated solely to the treatment and
elimination of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The Foundation is
affiliated with Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine where it
supports both clinical care and scientific research. The Les Turner ALS
Foundation's services are available to all ALS patients and caregivers,
regardless of where they receive their medical care. The Foundation's
comprehensive patient services include support group meetings, professional
in-home consultation services, communications and durable medical equipment
programs; respite care grants and many educational programs.

For more information about this event, please call Dan Godston at
312.543.7027. For more information about the Les Turner ALS Foundation,
please contact 847.679.3311 or events@lesturnerals.org.

*May 13th, 2007 *

Our recruiting effort seems to be failing. There was an immediate spike
of interest, but I have analyzed this to be a phenomenon in contemporary
perception inside the privileged and professional sector. You see, the
so-called smart people are busy working to think faster than the
pervasive sloganizing, which leads them to make snap decisions of merit
and quickly lose interest in ideas which do not seem to be entirely
controllable in the domain of their more reticulated egos. Instead of
looking for a very small team of privileged, creative geniuses, we need
to approach more everyday people, and sort of like the military, enlist
them in a phasing camp of preparation for diligent work over the coming
two or more years. Except in our camp there will be no spitting and
shouting in their faces, but an immediate influx of good vibes and
honest integration into a team with real goals and real rewards for good
work, which may be the definitive collegial atmosphere. This is Kansas
City, not Palo Alto or Cambridge. Though we are located in the
wealthiest region of the metro area, we will now focus on reaching out
to people with everyday hopes and expectations, letting the more
privileged candidates head off in conventional routes to wealth,
importance, and nobility to places like Stanford and MIT, yet they too
are vulnerable at the notion promising that Ivy degrees are, and always
will be, a golden ticket. How much longer can we expect a company like
Google to focus their recruiting effort on people who have probably
never really wanted desperately for anything ever in their lives, have
never had to accept and reconcile a powerful want and then make peace
and progress in the sphere of everyday expectation?

Kaya Oakes will be reading at Pegasus Books in downtown Berkeley CA on Tuesday, May 15th at 7:30 pm

  Kaya Oakes' work has appeared in Conduit, Volt, MiPoesias, Coconut, Shampoo, and many other journals. The recipient of awards and grants from the Academy of American Poets and the Bay Area Writing Project, she is also the senior editor of Kitchen Sink Magazine, and she teaches writing at the University of California, Berkeley.

    TELEGRAPH by Kaya Oakes
  ISBN: 978-1-886350-43-4
  Winner of the Transcontinental Poetry Prize (editor's choice, 2006)
  80 pages, 6 by 9, $14

Her book can be ordered here http://pavementsaw.org/books/telegraph.htm

  First books often offer versions of resurrection and Kaya Oakes' moving debut in TELEGRAPH charts a coming back to life with uncompromising lucidity and sorrow. In poetry rife with a bodily knowledge of the inherent “second-ness” of women’s history, Oakes writes for the one and the many, Elektra her guide in the passage. “I wonder if this earth meant anything when I leant my form to it,” the personae wonders in the final poem, and wonderfully, readers will find that it does, thanks to the earnest care of Kaya Oakes' making.
--Claudia Keelan


  ---------------------------------------

  Elektra in the offices


  Barefoot and ripe with new embarrassment
  Elektra walks up three floors, trying not to sweat


  Constriction in her thighs, those red bands drawn tight
  and everyone who waited without knowing her was blind
  would receive her in a spotless blackness reserved
  for those who have forgotten seeing means we learned to feel
  in blindness, too.


  You ought to have gone with her, years ago.
  That was when it was easier to feel through things
  by pulling those last strands of someone’s hair


  and wrapping up your fingers with them, like a tourniquet.
  Elektra cuts her hair in bathrooms where her shape is strange
  where the windows stay shut, even on the hottest nights
  nail scissors in half-drunk bathrooms where she doesn’t live.


  While shots go off outside, the scissors scrape and pull.
  She climbs the stairs climbed so many times before.
  She has no one on her side,


  she has handwriting and flowers gathered
  in a backyard where her scalp burned pink
  while the afternoons fed anorexic evenings
  and the day’s fluorescence never dimmed;


  unsure, unripe, unready. Still the pounding rocks her steps
  as innocents file past her. One hand, one knife,
  one brother burning somewhere in the city,
  The man is upstairs, working,
  or failing at his work and practicing his oaths.
  But nothing stops the inevitable click
  of the door that yields to business.




Be well

the optical

the optical asserts itself as punctum-turned-filter, the return of the an-
alogic within the digital. punctum {1} expands into the optical continuum
through a field transformation {x1,y1} > {x2,y2}. adjacent elements may
remain adjacent but any geometrical transformation more or less assures
that there are at least some elements that will no longer remain so. the
optical tends towards the puzzle; the punctum is those elements remaining
constant in the transformation of vector elements on the surface of a
sphere. every distortion is an artistic transform; some appear more artis-
tic than other. how much chaos does an image tolerate - transforms into
how much chaos delights the perceiver / to what extent is the original
image phenomenologically identifiable? but there are times when true joy
emerges, when the apparent real apparently shudders - when the viewer
shudders - as the real re/presents itself, and the punctum dissolves. for
the imaginary of the punctum is still the origin, and we rid ourselves of
that. http://www.asondheim.org/trawl.mov the trawl scrapes earth or sky,
taking everything along with it, irrupting surfaces, constructing an un-
recognizable real. the trawl transforms the planet, what is visible every-
where, the world turned upside-down, inside-out, reconstituted and mirror-
ed. beauty is the return of the symmetricized gift of the real.

First off--apologies for those who find this to be a geographical--
specific question clogging up the placeless 'virtual' discussion space,
but since I'm not aware of any "Bay Area specific" literary/cultural/
poetry discussion list, and I know there's quite a few 'bay area'
folks on this list,
I figured it's worth a shot, and I wouldn't be adverse to others
getting into discussions of other regions that aren't immediately
relevant to mine)....

Anyway, I currently got (I mean "have") access to a very cool
"performance" SPACE in Oakland, and I'm trying to figure out what to
DO with it....
If there's a way I can hold some kind of event, that would INCLUDE
poets (people who call themselves that) and have the potentials
of being exciting and/or relevant to people in other scenes....

Ever since Patrick Dunagan (i hope I'm spelling your name right)
wrote his critique of an anthology called "Bay Poetics"
on this list, I've been thinking that his comments could provide some
kind of opportunity for talking or writing pro-actively about
possible future social configurations here in the Bay Area, as
manifested in 'scenes' or ad-hoc reading events, presses, etc---...

Questions about how important solitude is for one's writing, or
calling, and how a scene or community may help that?
Questions about what mediates the social aspects in which some people
find some form of community,
     perhaps as a kind of replacement family, a feeling of security,
of mutual goading, or competitive cooperation?
     How important, or central,  is "the book?" or "the written text"
as the basis for something like 'community?''
     How important, or central,  the reading of one's work (to, for
the most part, other people who call themselves poets)
            as the basic for something like community?
     How important, or central, the phone conversation? Or the bar-
meeting? The talking? The just liking to hang-out?
           Or go to the same musical events, baseball games,
political rallies, day-care centers, the ostensibly 'non-poetry related'
            social aspects?
                 (teach, or be a student, at the same school; The
SFSU poets vs. The New School poets vs. The CCA poets, vs The Stegner
Fellow vs.
                  The Berkeley poets vs. The Mills poets (they used
to be called "The New Brutalists"--mostly class of '04)?
(okay, I know some people cross over; it ain't just VS either/or.....
                and the so-called 'independents'--and not just
because they're happy being loners...

                then there's also the young and old question, which
is different than the 'estabished' vs. 'non-established'
Were the "MANIC D" people originally connected with a school?
What about the various segregations?
         How significant is the black and white one? (do you want to
make it less?)
         How significant is the difference between one side of the
Bay and the other?
        The various more 'sophisitcated' and the more 'populist' etc
etc?
        Various "interfacings" with other so-called scenes,
'McSweeney's' to name but one much touted one....

I don't have time to get into a FATALISTIC discussion about it right now
(and I'm going to try to avoid that temptation when I'm done---
Ah, "I used to be disgusted, now I try to be amused'),
and if you find yourself Happy with existing social configurations in
your life and art right now,
(or if not entirely happy, at least thinking that "IT's GOOD ENOUGH
AS IS" and it would "TAKE TOO MUCH ENERGY
to try to change it), that's fine with me.

But I may not have much going for me right now, but one thing I got
is a SPACE where we could at least get something started
(or help something along that's already started),
and I still got what Marx once called "LABOR POWER" (and "while
there's still life, there's hope"
as John Lennon said before he died) and a belief in creative
competition, unity in diversity, 'united we stand, divided we fall'
and a burning feeling that something that needs to be changed is in
our power to change....

and, well, I figured I'd just try it out (ya know, run it by y'all)
here.
Feel free to contact me backchannel, though frontchannel would
probably be better....

If you want, you could also pay for the 'writing workshop' I'm
planning to teach here soon.
I'll send an announcement out about that soon. But in the meantime,
feel free to respond to this free offer
(which may end up costing 'more' than money, but that's a whole other
essay thing..)

My second book, The Phoenix and the Dragon: Poems of the Alchemical
Transformation, is about to hit the shelves.  It follows my first book,
Tellstones, and several anthologies and is my first collection through
Smithcraft Press.

I am looking for Booksignings and readings during the summer.  I am also
looking for reviews.



Included in this volume are pieces for which I was awarded the 2006 =
EPPIE
Prize for poetry in an anthology.

In addition, it contains several pieces of stunning artwork by Evanne =
Floyd,
whose work also graces the back cover.

So please support the arts, writing and, most importantly, Evanne and I, =
by
looking below and ordering your advance copy.

Of course, the absolute easiest way to reserve your edition is to use =
PayPal
or, even better, to order online, you need only go to adamtritt.com and
click on the bookcover. Easy!

Please forward this to where ever and who ever you can/like/wish or your
entire emails list=85 whichever is larger (smile).

Thank you,

The Diffusion of Memory

I am trying to remember my daughter. At the age of five. Then eight. Ten. I
cannot. Not fully. I have memories of events, trips, ways of being and
things we did. I have memories of how I felt, diffuse and drawn. But to none
of these are attached any visions. I remember taking pictures but not the
pictures themselves save the presence of those on our walls.

I don't see why this has to be limited to the Bay area.

Here, everywhere, there are lots of performance spaces.  If it is
music or theatre-oriented, the model is promotion.  You are promoting
a night, so that on average you get a certain number crowd paying a
door charge or buying a certain amount of drinks; the idea is that the
door or bar covers the cost of operating the venue.

If it is gallery-oriented, if it is to accompany a show, it is usually
entertainment-oriented.  The idea is to draw a crowd to the show or
the gallery, or make going to the gallery more fun, not to present the
work as art.

There's a repopularization of a sort of space which is modeled more on
galleries, but a lot of free schools, lectures, younger artists,
quasi-collectives, etc. run them.
A lot of these sort of things are being run with an incredible energy
here in LA, on the eastside and downtown.  It has repolarized the
scene, though.

Subject:      Question re: Language Poetry and the Body
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I attended the panel above named this past Saturday and was surprised
by a comment by Bruce Andrews (and also the apparent anger behind it
after all this time) to the effect that LANGUAGE was a rebellion or
act of opposition to "The New American Poetry and all that romantic
crap." I have no idea if this is particular to Bruce (in which case I
think my query goes out to him) or to a particular group of poets who
call themselves (or are called by others) Language poets. Here it is:
since neither the New American Poetry (as represented in the
eponymous book) nor romanticism are monolithic concepts, what does
"the NAP and all that romantic crap" mean?

ah well, i do like to speak for the Bay Area, anyhow i was born there.
I even lived in Golden Gate Park for a couple of weeks when I was
young...

It is true that there are a lot of little circles, it's because our
circles are made out of perosnal relationships--i.e. actual friends
and it feels like we do get pretty involved in each other's lives. but
they are quite open and interweaving and interlocking circles, I
think. Just grab a beer and sit down and then be prepared to get
pretty involved--the is the main part of us, i think, how we push one
another to take more and more wilder risks--yes, i'll readily admit it
sometimes just for the sake of wildness but often we're pushed on by a
political cause and often the wild ideas bear fruit).

a good place to start:

http://newyipes.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html

(I picked this archives page because I'm a big fan of Haleh Hatami)/
Are you wanting to put out a call for performers? If you write up
something about the space, its location, schedule, etc I'd be happy to
help pass it around.

It might be fun to try to organize a reading of some of Sidebrow's
collaborative works? I'd be up for working on that if it can somehow
get scheduled around summer travels...

what ever happened to the pickle family circus, by the way?

I am old enough to remember the poetry from the 1970s. I am thinking about the poetry that has the epiphany in the poem--and it does come off as being very romantic as to how I think he means it. There was always nature, the internal struggle, and then the insight at the end of  the poem. I quit writing poetry for many years because I could no longer write that type of poem--if I could even write it in the beginning. It was boring. A friend, who was/is a Language poet (as I understand it) encouraged me to write differently. He was a graduate of the MFA program at Bard. Wasn't that MFA program one of the major Lanuage poetry centers? I think of James Wright as being the Romantic poet of that era. I loved his poetry at the time, but I don't read it anymore. Also, Robert Bly.(I am just a little prairie flower (WCW) from the midwest, so many things come to us much later.)

The New American Poetry refers to a specific anthology and the poets
in it, and I'm sure that's what Bruce meant. What you're talking
about is the stuff those poets were taking on, and which still
dominates US poetry.

Yes, much poetry from the more mainstream poetry journals.

How about giving some examples of NAP poets who did this? The examples
you give below are James Wright and Robert Bly.
Surely these are poets on the other side of the net from the NAP poets?

Yes, in a sense. When Andrews attacks those in Allen's anthology, he's
attacking the highly aware romanticism of Olson, Creeley, Ginsberg, O'Hara,
Duncan, etc. (I don't believe that that romanticism was prevalent then or
now. Then, academic and confessional poetry; now, the romanticism of
post-confessionalism and other bland period-style varieties.)

I think Andrews's attack makes sense in general terms. In the same terms,
however, I have often seen a hard-headed romanticism, an insistence on
certain types of possible meaning, especially ontological, and an
intuitional poetics, lumped with the underconsidered romaniticism that has
been in favor, though its flavors have somewhat changed, these fifty odd
years.

I didn't hear the comment in full, but what we have here ignores the
correspondences between the two groups: Language and New American Poetry. I
think Andrews has acknowledged this, and I know many New American Poets do
(e.g., Creeley, Guest, Eigner, Duncan)

(There was, of course, animosity as well, Dorn calling the Langauge Poetry
the Languish Poets, etc.)

The New American Poetry refers to a specific anthology and the poets
in it, and I'm sure that's what Bruce meant. What you're talking
about is the stuff those poets were taking on, and which still
dominates US poetry.

Subject:      LANGPO AND THE BODY: A REPORT
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Here's my writeup of the event. I'll post it to the blog later on today.
Apologies in advance if, in my scrawled notes, I might have misquoted
anyone.

Best, Tim

The panel on language poetry and the body surprised me in that each of the
participants had a very different take on what “body” might mean in the
context of poetics. Some dealt with phenomenology and some with the
performative aspets of gender, and only one of the essays, that of Bruce
Andrews, connected body with the notion of a romantic authorial subject, and
even then only as part of a spectrum more descriptive than proscriptive. The
house was packed and I think the discussion went very well. I look forward
to publishing most or all of these essays as a group in the next issue of
EOAGH, which should be out in June or July, so you’ll be able to read the
text in full sometime then.

Maria Damon’s essay traced connections through the work of three poets,
Leslie Scalapino, Carla Harryman, and Nada Gordon and their different
conceptions of the body. She used Benjamin to read Scalapino’s project as
related to the question of how to endure shocks without suffering
repression, and she saw embodiment here as chiefly an issue of bodies in
spaces, a kin dof phenomenological awareness. She looked at Harryman’s work
through the lens of gendered bodies in history, the concept of bodies under
the state. The dilemma that “as a lady, she cannot function as the word
‘lady’” brings up the question “is it possible to be both gateway and
consciousness?” Damon looked at Nada’s poetry as a kind of ecriture feminine
(!) in which you can feel the presence of the “hegemonic brigade in the
wings of the burlesque show.” She aptly described Nada’s writing as
“terrifyingly ludic femininity” and posited Folly’s approach to
consciousness as a “utopian alternative to madness.” Then she compared
aspects of Nada’s project to that of Leslie Scalapino, which is a comparison
I don’t believe I’ve ever seen before. Truly a lively and original approach
to the topic.

In Steve Benson’s memorable presentation, the poet performed acts of
reading, listering to a tape of himself reading his notes on the panel
topic. These notes were being played back over headphones to him on high
speed while he adopted the role of a reader responding to his own distorted
writing, a reader who at times seemed to be something more: “Things are
awful for me, speaking as the entire human body.” His hilarious and
insightful performance was filled with the energy of improvisation and
lively asides: “more on that later.” Benson walked around the entire space
while making this talk, which was accompanied by vigorous movements and
theatrical hand gestures, as if to illustrate certain points such as the
physicality of words on a page, the physical experience of being at times
within the page surface, at other times “zooming from me to you.”

Leslie Scalapino talked about the role of the hippocampus in experiencing
the relationship between past and present and how memories are formed in the
writing process. In a really amazing and thoughtful essay, Scalapino
discussed some of the ways in which writing provides a locus for addressing
and intervening in the relationship between past, present, and possible
future: “it’s seeing in a space there not being cause-and-effects,” the
action of the writing “being apprehending not forming events.” However, by
apprehending the SPACE of events, one can change them and thus change the
future. Unlike her example of an early langpo figure (not sure who) who
stated that a poem about a man with AIDS was “merely emotional content,”
Scalapino argued offered other terms with which to examine or re-frame that
issue: “the relation is instead between the mind and experiencing.” She
questioned Watten’s notion of langpo as being opposed to “expressive
poetics” that supposedly reject modernism, saying that his distinction
“precludes sensation and others’ perceptions as BEING political change.” Her
approach of using “sound/syntax as thought-shape to apprehend mind-shape
came close to my own view on the subject in terms of the importance of
phenomenology for writing and the inter-relation of body and mind, not to
mention gender. There is something extremely daring and mind-blowing about
Scalapino’s suggestion that we can “eliminate memory as basis or vehicle and
thus change the social constructions that are part of us.” Perhaps
particularly noteworthy in this talk is one of the first times I have ever
heard Leslie Scalapino employ prosopopoeia or apostrophe in a moment of
surprising and wonderful self-interruption: “Leslie, these things are
affecting your body!”

Last but certainly not least, I was won over by Bruce Andrews very
reasonable and effective essay “Body & Language,” which followed his earlier
commentary on the topic (see his wonderful Alabama book) but proposed the
situation as a complex sliding scale rather than as opposed, ossified
binaries. Andrews began by addressing the accusation that language poetry is
usually criticized as a disembodied writing practice, and pointed out that
this critique only makes sense if we draw a parallel between the body and
the author in the sense of the authorial “self.” Instead of “the preenings
of author control,” Andrews offered inter-media analogoies such as the
notion of creating a disjunctive surface as in abstract art. He pointed out
that whereas most romantic poetry deals with traditional ways of
“showcasing” embodiment through the “representation of bodies,” the goal of
langpo is to resist such an outward pull of representation, creating a
“surface that emphasizes the surface of the page.” Andrews argued that
language poetry is not necessarily a disembodied form of writing and that
there is always the chance for bodily experience in the emphasis on the
reader, a)thinking, b)loving, c)politicizing. He asked the very useful
question “what constitutes an expansive freedom for the reader?” as well as
the poly-sci-inflected inquiry “which features of lit propose an
imperialistic text”? The sliding scale here contrasted on the one hand the
notion of an untroubled depiction of the authorial self, and on the other
hand the notion of a language without reference, neither of which would be a
desirable situation (“not phobic avoidance of meaning altogether”). Rather,
these extremes lie on a spectrum. They are tools for use in thinking about
the type of generic or particular representation taking place in a text, and
how this method of representation might relate to “the body of an expansive
reader.” Andrews ended his essay with an allegory which drew certain
parallels between the concerns of language writing and aspects of the US
policy of containment regarding the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

There was a provocative question-and-answer period afterward in which we had
many wonderful questions from Madeline Gins, Bob Perelman, Wystan Curnow,
and many others. I learned a lot from working on this panel and I look
forward to many more such discussions at Segue in the future.

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is pressing the U.S. Congress to
enact a sweeping intellectual property bill that would increase
criminal penalties for copyright infringement, including "attempts"
to commit piracy.

"To meet the global challenges of IP crime, our criminal laws must be
kept updated," Gonzales said during a speech before the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce in Washington on Monday.

The Bush administration is throwing its support behind a proposal
called the Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2007, which is
likely to receive the enthusiastic support of the movie and music
industries and would represent the most dramatic rewrite of copyright
law since a 2005 measure dealing with pre-release piracy.

Here's our podcast on the topic.

The IPPA would, for instance:
* Criminalize "attempting" to infringe copyright. Federal law
currently punishes not-for-profit copyright infringement with between
1 and 10 years in prison, but there has to be actual infringement
that takes place. The IPPA would eliminate that requirement. (The
Justice Department's summary of the legislation says: "It is a
general tenet of the criminal law that those who attempt to commit a
crime but do not complete it are as morally culpable as those who
succeed in doing so.")

* Create a new crime of life imprisonment for using pirated software.
Anyone using counterfeit products who "recklessly causes or attempts
to cause death" can be imprisoned for life. During a conference call,
Justice Department officials gave the example of a hospital using
pirated software instead of paying for it.

* Permit more wiretaps for piracy investigations. Wiretaps would be
authorized for investigations of Americans who are "attempting" to
infringe copyrights.

* Allow computers to be seized more readily. Specifically, property
such as a PC "intended to be used in any manner" to commit a
copyright crime would be subject to forfeiture, including civil asset
forfeiture. Civil asset forfeiture has become popular among police
agencies in drug cases as a way to gain additional revenue, and is
problematic and controversial.

* Increase penalties for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act's anti-circumvention regulations. Currently criminal violations
are currently punished by jail times of up to 10 years and fines of
up to $1 million. The IPPA would add forfeiture penalties too.

* Add penalties for "intended" copyright crimes. Currently certain
copyright crimes require someone to commit the "distribution,
including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of at least
10 copies" valued at over $2,500. The IPPA would insert a new
prohibition: actions that were "intended to consist of" distribution.

* Require Homeland Security to alert the Recording Industry
Association of America. That would happen when compact discs with
"unauthorized fixations of the sounds or sounds and images of a live
musical performance" are attempted to be imported. Neither the Motion
Picture Association of America nor the Business Software Alliance
(nor any other copyright holder such as photographers, playwrights,
or news organizations, for that matter) would qualify for this kind
of special treatment.

A representative of the Motion Picture Association of America told
us: "We appreciate the department's commitment to intellectual
property protection and look forward to working with both the
department and Congress as the process moves ahead."

What's still unclear is the kind of reception this legislation might
encounter on Capitol Hill. Gonzales may not be terribly popular, but
Democrats do tend to be more closely aligned with Hollywood and the
recording industry than the GOP. (A few years ago, Republicans even
savaged fellow conservatives for allying themselves too closely with
copyright holders.)

A spokeswoman for Rep. Howard Berman, the California Democrat who
heads the House Judiciary subcommittee that focuses on intellectual
property, said the congressman is reviewing proposals from the
attorney general and from others. The aide said the Hollywood
politician plans to introduce his own intellectual property
enforcement bill later this year but said his office is not prepared
to discuss any details yet.

One key Republican was less guarded. "We are reviewing (the attorney
general's) proposal. Any plan to stop IP theft will benefit the
economy and the American worker," said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas,
who's the top Republican on the House Judiciary committee. "I applaud
the attorney general for recognizing the need to protect intellectual
property."

Still, it's too early to tell what might happen. A similar copyright
bill that Smith, the RIAA, and the Software and Information Industry
Association announced with fanfare last April never went anywhere.

Jerry Falwell is dead!  And I'm celebrating!

An old friend on the phone today who told
me he died was upset when I said that I was
celebrating, OH WELL!  My friend is a
Buddhist, so I understand my friend, and
respect my friend.  But I'm NOT a Buddhist!

My only regret is that he went peacefully.

When I think of the terrible things he did and
said against the queer community, and many
others, and his support of the Phelps family
who would picket the funerals of gay men
who died of AIDS, well, there's just no way
I can be quiet about how I feel!  REALLY FEEL!

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY INDEED!  ANOTHER
FASCIST DOWN IS A BEAUTIFUL THING!

Woo Hoo! I always said I would throw a party when Reagan died and then I didn't. I certainly do not care how tacky anyone finds it: A toast to the death of Jerry Falwell; one self-righteous, hypocritically moralizing, neo-fascist, queer-bashing asshole down, a few thousand more to go....

I am no fan of Falwell, but dude....

I hate to break it to you but just because he is dead, does not mean that
what he believed in and represented has also died.

One can wish of course, but really death doesn't change these things at
all.  Its just death.  There is nothing to celebrate.  You are focused
entirely on the wrong thing.  You are still yourself, and the world is still
the world, and there are, alas, plenty of Falwells out there who will
cherish his memory no matter how insane that sounds to us.

Letting go of someone you can't stand is not that much different from
letting go of someone you love.  Among otehr things, you have to let go of
the illusion that their death will effect a profound change in the world or
in your life or result in hundreds of dnacing munchkins.  It won't.  Sorry.
Falwell was just a person.  There is still plenty of work to do.

Falwell's politics/public presence was noxious, but I can't bring myself to
rejoice in anyone's death .I understand your emotions, CAC, just as I deeply
respect your person, but...I'm troubled by your post and some of the easy
responses to same. Wishing "evil doers" dead doesn't help us very much.  It
perpetuates some really retrograde processes.

Hi,

  This is another post that may be more relevant to Bay Area types.... Can anyone verify that Robert Duncan received front-page attention in the San Francisco Chronicle upon his death in 1988? I know I've read that somewhere but I can't figure out where. This is for the introduction to a collection of interviews with Bay Area experimental writers.

  Many thanks,

Dear Suzanne, yes, everything you say is true.

However...
When I was a kid in high school AIDS broke out,
and I was living in rural America, terribly in Love
with my boyfriend.  Jerry Falwell was a name on
the tip of every tongue as a positive.  In other words
where I come from Falwell was someone to look
up to and admire.  And people did, and you were
afraid of these people if you knew what was good
for you.

And when everyone found out that my friend was
more than my "friend," well, our lives were never
the same.  Never the same.  In fact our lives soon
became -- literally became -- unbearable.  And we
were just kids, and we got high all the time just
to get through each day.  And while it toughened
me up and got me used to the extreme brutality
possible in this world, my boyfriend was destroyed.

And while I understand what you say, and feel
you make valid points, we still need to cut a little
place for ourselves in this world where we can
be free enough in all the misery and suffering we
have endured to CELEBRATE some release.  And
yes, Jerry Falwell's death for me is a celebration!

He was an unapologetic fascist who spread so
much hatred, and ruined so many lives, and
the fucking NEWS right now is making the man
sound like a charming, wise old Yoda.  His life is
something I want VERY MUCH WANT to celebrate
being over.  For all those I have LOVED in this
world who have suffered and died as a DIRECT
result of his support of homophobia and misogyny,
the drinks I toast tonight are for THEM!

To me, the death of Jerry Falwell is like celebrating
a war ending.  His wish for genocide for queers
and outspoken women is reason enough to be
happy he is dead.

It's almost as good as Ronald Reagan's death!
Ah, the death of evil men feels like a fresh, clean
patch of Earth has been cleared for a better world!
And I LOVE this world so much!

Thank you for this very true letter Suzanne Burns.Today marks the 59th anni=
versary of Al-Nakba (The Catastrophe)--the forced removal of Palestinians f=
rom their homelands and the Right of Return which still remains a dream at =
best--Reverend Fallwell was a vociferous and outspoken supporter of Israel =
for decades and a fund raiser as well.  Recently he had converted to the be=
lief of some branches of Evangelicism that Jewish people go directly to Hea=
ven, the "Dual Covenant".  (Though an admirer of his support, Abe Foxman wa=
s also  critical of some of Falwell's views.  Not the sort of friend anyone=
 really keen on having.)  (I don't pretend to understand this in great deta=
il--)     He was as violently bigoted against Palestinians and Arabs as aga=
inst most of the human beings on the face of the earth.       While Preside=
nt, Jimmy Carter said, "Speaking as a Christian, Jerry Falwell should go to=
 Hell."     This very day as one bigot passes on--many more are being born-=
-literally and figuratively--the work of Jerry Falwell is never done . . . =
"My name is Legion"--One can celebrate him personally taking the Big Sleep-=
-but tomorrow morning there will be many more Jerry's hitting the pavements=
--airwaves--print media--"coming to a town near you--and you--"--the world =
over--in the guise of all sorts of rhetorics philosophies and ideologies--"=
Legion" could care less abt a celebration or more--haven't you got a hangov=
er?? Legion laughs--you got to pay to play---      As Suzanne says--still p=

Falwell's karma and ours may be different, but death is the great equalizer.

Remember in the Clint Eastwood movie when one of his cronies rejoices in the death of a bad guy, saying, "He sure had it coming!'" And Eastwood squints and says, "We ALL got it coming.'"

I'm with Suzanne--all the hatred he stood for lives on. Don't rejoice--organize. To paraphrase Mother Jones.

Sarah,
I happen to have the Thursday, February 4, 1988 San Francisco Chronicle =
because it did indeed print a front page story about Robert's death =
written by Kevin Leary.  Headline:  Renowned Poet Robert Duncan Dies in =
S.F.

Best,

Can anyone verify that Robert Duncan received front-page attention in =
the San Francisco Chronicle upon his death in 1988? I know I've read =

introduction to a collection of interviews with Bay Area experimental =

Yes, there was a write up "Renowned Poet Robert Duncan dies in SF" on
the front page of the Feb. 4 issue that continues with a nice photo to
boot on page A4.  If you send me your address I can mail ya a copy if
you like.

Cheers,

I'm with Conrad -- death comes to everyone, and I have no remorse that his has finally arrived.  He encouraged hate like nobody's business.

He also demonized the purple Teletubbie for allegedly being gay (in spite of being an asexual androgynous stuffed toy that giggled at most) because 'he' carried a purse and wore a triangle on top of his head -- which, yes, is laughable in the superficial, but is truly just the tip of how Falwell encouraged the very real witch hunt mentality, the one that has at least a third of gay teens committing suicide, even today.   Even today.

And his god is the god of "Judge not lest ye be judged."  Another selective interpretor of "The Word" bites the dust, Ding Dong, Amen.

Dear  Suzanne, yes, everything you say is true.

However...
When I was a  kid in high school AIDS broke out,
and I was living in rural America,  terribly in Love
with my boyfriend.  Jerry Falwell was a name  on
the tip of every tongue as a positive.  In other words
where I  come from Falwell was someone to look
up to and admire.  And people  did, and you were
afraid of these people if you knew what was good
for  you.

And when everyone found out that my friend was
more than my  "friend," well, our lives were never
the same.  Never the same.   In fact our lives soon
became -- literally became -- unbearable.  And  we
were just kids, and we got high all the time just
to get through each  day.  And while it toughened
me up and got me used to the extreme  brutality
possible in this world, my boyfriend was destroyed.

And  while I understand what you say, and feel
you make valid points, we still  need to cut a little
place for ourselves in this world where we can
be  free enough in all the misery and suffering we
have endured to CELEBRATE  some release.  And
yes, Jerry Falwell's death for me is a  celebration!

He was an unapologetic fascist who spread so
much  hatred, and ruined so many lives, and
the fucking NEWS right now is making  the man
sound like a charming, wise old Yoda.  His life  is
something I want VERY MUCH WANT to celebrate
being over.  For  all those I have LOVED in this
world who have suffered and died as a  DIRECT
result of his support of homophobia and misogyny,
the drinks I  toast tonight are for THEM!

To me, the death of Jerry Falwell is like  celebrating
a war ending.  His wish for genocide for queers
and  outspoken women is reason enough to be
happy he is dead.

It's almost  as good as Ronald Reagan's death!
Ah, the death of evil men feels like a  fresh, clean
patch of Earth has been cleared for a better world!
And I  LOVE this world so  much!

I fully understand the anger people feel toward this man.  But....

I am also deeply uncomfortable with the "dance on his grave" energy.  Its so
feral, and it feeds right back into what he stood for. Please understand
that I am deeply conflicted.  I say this as someone who comes from a family
that has.... people like this in it, and sometimes some of us say "Oh I
can't wait to wear red at that funeral!".

I don't want to go into details, but I know all too well that letting go and
taking the high road is the better way.  I'm not saying this for him-- but
for us. Its the better way for US.

Glee is not pretty, and over time will carve bitchy lines in one's face.
Please continue fighting for the living.

The sad thing is that Falwell will be inevitably replaced my someone just as
Foul. Hate speech incorporated.

When I once worked in Juvenile Hall - every time a hugely difficult person
would leave, and folks would sigh all around as if liberation had arrived,
another dude would show up and be just as difficult.

The difference here is that Falwell never had to serve time for the
consequences of his speech - tho he constantly shouted fire in a crowded
theater, i.e. the US.

Hate is hate. Hating in the name of good: we all do that. But he was
reprehensible. However the problem's elsewhere - those who keep their
mouths shut, those who don't have the pulpit, those who whisper. And
they're legion. And they're close to all of us. And Robertson's still
alive. But I'm glad he's dead. But I wish a hell of a lot of others were
dead too. - Alan

If CNN is any indication of the popular media's response, Falwell isn't exactly being celebrated, thankfully.  They cite the studies of an anthropologist focused on Falwell's legacy, significantly noting where he placed the blame for Sept 11:


To many critics, this paradox is what makes his legacy so lamentable. "He made it comfortable for churches to get actively involved in politics," says the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. "His strategy will be continued by his would-be successors -- a focus on hot-button issues like gay marriage (rather than significant moral issues like child poverty and health care), and an eagerness to make outrageous statements to the media, in order to build a religious-political empire."
Many now remember him most for outrageous statements he made after leaving the Moral Majority -- in 1999, his house organ the National Liberty Journal warned parents that the Tinky Winky TV character was secretly gay and morally dangerous; in 2001, he blamed the September 11 terrorist attack on "pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America."

I too come from that tradition, Suzanne, having grown up on the Bible Belt myself.  In fact, I received a scholarship at the ripe age of 16 in the amount of $5,000 directly from Falwell (or his stamped on signature) to attend Liberty University.  I have family members who still proudly wear racist slogans ("You've Got Your X, We've Got Ours" - complete with the GA confederate flag was the most recent) and celebrate blows against their assorted brands of evil, closely aligned with Falwell's, some that would include me if they actually acknowledged certain aspects of my life.

I just think it's strange that our society allows us to feel and express only one particular emotion for someone's death, sadness, but the expression of relief is somehow inappropriate?  I mean, I'm not bouncing off the walls under the illusion that homophobic campaigns are somehow finished, but that one very large hateful movement has received even the slightest of blows, or a pause, does give me some pleasure.  To equate the evil, the hate mongering that Falwell did with feeling and expressing this kind of relief over his recent absence, or those followers' "loss", on a listserv no less, is misleading.  It's not a clear-cut hate-for-hate equation.  Their hate has serious consequences that have resulted in much measurable pain and many deaths.  I'm not finding pleasure in some sadist notion nor am I condoning aggressive hate that results in someone's pain or death -- likewise, any physical pain he felt doesn't delight me, but to feel some gladness that his brand of
 aggressive homophobic tactics may have taken a blow simply because Falwell is dead certainly provides a momentary gladness, regardless of how that implicates even my own family members.  When I express that and articulate why, I *am* taking the high road and fighting for the living.

(From Craig Smith: Smithcraft Press)

I have to admit, writing about Falwell=92s death poses an awkward =
challenge
for me. When I worked at Americans United for Separation of Church and =
State
for several years, I read Falwell=92s materials, I listened to his =
speeches, I
watched his interviews, and got a real sense for who this man was and =
what
he devoted his life to.=20

In literally every instance, I was repelled and appalled. But is it not
callous to bash a man just hours after his death?

I have another idea =97 I=92ll document Jerry Falwell=92s professional =
life and
let his record speak for itself.

March 1980: Falwell tells an Anchorage rally about a conversation with
President Carter at the White House. Commenting on a January breakfast
meeting, Falwell claimed to have asked Carter why he had =93practicing
homosexuals=94 on the senior staff at the White House. According to =
Falwell,
Carter replied, =93Well, I am president of all the American people, and =
I
believe I should represent everyone.=94 When others who attended the =
White
House event insisted that the exchange never happened, Falwell responded
that his account =93was not intended to be a verbatim report,=94 but =
rather an
=93honest portrayal=94 of Carter=92s position.

August 1980: After Southern Baptist Convention President Bailey Smith =
tells
a Dallas Religious Right gathering that =93God Almighty does not hear =
the
prayer of a Jew,=94 Falwell gives a similar view. =93I do not =
believe,=94 he told
reporters, =93that God answers the prayer of any unredeemed Gentile or =
Jew.=94
After a meeting with an American Jewish Committee rabbi, he changed =
course,
telling an interviewer on NBC=92s =93Meet the Press=94 that =93God hears =
the prayers
of all persons=85. God hears everything.=94

July 1984: Falwell is forced to pay gay activist Jerry Sloan $5,000 =
after
losing a court battle. During a TV debate in Sacramento, Falwell denied
calling the gay-oriented Metropolitan Community Churches =93brute =
beasts=94 and
=93a vile and Satanic system=94 that will =93one day be utterly =
annihilated and
there will be a celebration in heaven.=94 When Sloan insisted he had a =
tape,
Falwell promised $5,000 if he could produce it. Sloan did so, Falwell
refused to pay and Sloan successfully sued. Falwell appealed, with his
attorney charging that the Jewish judge in the case was prejudiced. He =
lost
again and was forced to pay an additional $2,875 in sanctions and court
fees.

October 1987: The Federal Election Commission fines Falwell for =
transferring
$6.7 million in funds intended for his ministry to political committees.

February 1988: The U.S. Supreme Court strikes down a $200,000 jury award =
to
Falwell for =93emotional distress=94 he suffered because of a Hustler =
magazine
parody. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, usually a Falwell favorite,
wrote the unanimous opinion in Hustler v. Falwell, ruling that the First
Amendment protects free speech.

February 1993: The Internal Revenue Service determines that funds from
Falwell=92s Old Time Gospel Hour program were illegally funneled to a
political action committee. The IRS forced Falwell to pay $50,000 and
retroactively revoked the Old Time Gospel Hour=92s tax-exempt status for
1986-87.

March 1993: Despite his promise to Jewish groups to stop referring to
America as a =93Christian nation,=94 Falwell gives a sermon saying, =
=93We must
never allow our children to forget that this is a Christian nation. We =
must
take back what is rightfully ours.=94

1994-1995: Falwell is criticized for using his =93Old Time Gospel =
Hour=94 to
hawk a scurrilous video called =93The Clinton Chronicles=94 that makes a =
number
of unsubstantiated charges against President Bill Clinton =97 among them =
that
he is a drug addict and that he arranged the murders of political =
enemies in
Arkansas. Despite claims he had no ties to the project, evidence =
surfaced
that Falwell helped bankroll the venture with $200,000 paid to a group
called Citizens for Honest Government (CHG). CHG=92s Pat Matrisciana =
later
admitted that Falwell and he staged an infomercial interview promoting =
the
video in which a silhouetted reporter said his life was in danger for
investigating Clinton. (Matrisciana himself posed as the reporter.) =
=93That
was Jerry=92s idea to do that,=94 Matrisciana recalled. =93He thought =
that would
be dramatic.=94=20

November 1997: Falwell accepts $3.5 million from a front group =
representing
controversial Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon to ease Liberty =
University=92s
financial woes.=20

April 1998: Confronted on national television with a controversial quote
from America Can Be Saved!, a published collection of his sermons, =
Falwell
denies having written the book or had anything to do with it. In the =
1979
work, Falwell wrote, =93I hope to live to see the day when, as in the =
early
days of our country, we won=92t have any public schools. The churches =
will
have taken them over again and Christians will be running them. What a =
happy
day that will be!=94 Despite Falwell=92s denial, Sword of the Lord =
Publishing,
which produced the book, confirms that Falwell wrote it.

January 1999: Falwell tells a pastors=92 conference in Kingsport, Tenn., =
that
the Antichrist prophesied in the Bible is alive today and =93of course =
he=92ll
be Jewish.=94

February 1999: Falwell becomes the object of nationwide ridicule after =
his
National Liberty Journal newspaper issues a =93parents alert=94 warning =
that
Tinky Winky, a character on the popular PBS children=92s show =
=93Teletubbies,=94
might be gay.

September 2001: Falwell blames Americans for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
=93The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God =
will not
be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we =
make
God mad. I really believe that the Pagans, and the abortionists, and the
feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make
that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, =
all of
them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their =
face
and say, =91You helped this happen.=92=94

November 2005: Falwell spearheads campaign to resist =93war on =
Christmas.=94

February 2007: Falwell describes global warming as a conspiracy =
orchestrated
by Satan, liberals, and The Weather Channel.

Say what you will about the man and his life, but he leaves behind a
colorful background.=20

In general, we live with the paradox that death is the only ground for hope--insofar as it clears the way for people who may be better than we are.

  And almost anybody is better than that guy.

yes, Jerry Falwell's death for me is a celebration!

He was an unapologetic fascist who spread so

the fucking NEWS right now is making the man

something I want VERY MUCH WANT to celebrate
being over. For all those I have LOVED in this
world who have suffered and died as a DIRECT
result of his support of homophobia and misogyny,
the drinks I toast tonight are for THEM!

To me, the death of Jerry Falwell is like celebrating
a war ending. His wish for genocide for queers
and outspoken women is reason enough to be
happy he is dead.

It's almost as good as Ronald Reagan's death!
Ah, the death of evil men feels like a fresh, clean
patch of Earth has been cleared for a better world!
And I LOVE this world so much!

The Final Showdown - Mumia Case Reaches Its Climax

By Dave Lindorff and Linn Washington, Jr.

CounterPunch.org - May 15, 2007

http://www.counterpunch.org/lindorff05152007.html

The case of death row prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal, now a
quarter of a century long, is heading to a climax this
Thursday in a hearing before a three-judge panel of the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. It is a
hearing that could result in a new trial for the
Philadelphia journalist and former Black Panther, or
possibly in a new date with the executioner.

The wide range of possible outcomes of this hearing
results from the fact that Abu-Jamal and the
Philadelphia District Attorney have filed cross-appeals
in the case. Abu-Jamal, convicted in 1982 for the 1981
slaying of white Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel
Faulkner during an arrest of Abu-Jamal's younger
brother William, is appealing his conviction. He is
arguing that his jury was unconstitutionally purged of
black jurors by the prosecutor, who used peremptory
challenges to bar 10 or 11 black jurors from being
seated, though all had said that they could vote for a
death penalty. He is also appealing his conviction on
the ground that the prosecutor, Joseph McGill,
improperly diminished the jury's sense of
responsibility for their verdict by telling them that a
guilty verdict would "not be final" since there would
be "appeal after appeal."

The DA's office, meanwhile, has appealed a 2001
decision by Federal District Judge William Yohn
overturning Abu-Jamal's death sentence-a ruling that if
sustained, converts Abu-Jamal's penalty to life in
prison without possibility of parole.

It is impossible to second-guess what the three judges
sitting on this appeal will decide on any of the claims
before them, but looking at their prior decisions, all
three of the judges, who include Chief Judge Anthony
Scirica and Judge Robert Cowen, both Reagan appointees,
and Judge Thomas Ambro, a Clinton appointee have,
during their time on the Third Circuit, overturned
capital convictions based upon the same claim Abu-Jamal
is making about race-based exclusion of jurors by the
prosecution. In his federal habeas appeal of his
conviction-the so-called Batson claim regarding jury
bias--Abu-Jamal's attorneys noted that in a city that
is 44 percent African-American, his jury initially had
only three black members (one was removed before the
start of the trial, under questionable circumstances
also possibly relating to judicial bias, leaving only
two).

Abu-Jamal further presented evidence that his mostly
white jury was the result of a pattern of racism in the
city's justice system. Prosecutor McGill, who used 11
of his permitted 15 peremptory challenges (challenges
to bar jurors for which no reason has to be provided),
to remove black jurors otherwise qualified to sit, had
a record over the course of six capital cases between
1977 and 1986, of striking 74 percent of potential
black jurors while striking only 25 percent of white
jurors. Furthermore, defense data show that over the
same period, during which Ed Rendell was Philadelphia's
district attorney, prosecutors working under his
direction collectively used their peremptory challenges
to eliminate black jurors 58 percent of the time,
compared to only 22 percent of the time for white
jurors.

If the appellate court decides that this damning
statistical evidence shows or suggests a pattern of
racism in jury selection, it would be bound to either
order a new trial, or to remand the case back to Judge
Yohn for a full hearing on the jury bias issue.

This would appear to offer Abu-Jamal his best chance
for a new trial. If the judges vote the way each of
them has voted in other similar cases, it could happen.

A second possibility for a new trial would be McGill's
clearly inappropriate summation to the jury, in which
he essentially told them to forget about "proof beyond
a reasonable doubt," and which the judge, who still
posthumously holds the national record for death
penalty convictions (31), allowed to go unchallenged.
Many a death sentence has been overturned for just such
prosecutorial misconduct, but to date, neither the
Third Circuit nor the US Supreme Court has overturned a
conviction on the basis of such comments. Still, it
remains a possible avenue for a reversal and a new
trial.

A third avenue of federal appeal by Abu-Jamal argues
that his initial appeal of his conviction, called a
Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) hearing, was
constitutionally flawed because the judge--the same
Albert Sabo who tried him originally--was biased in
favor of the prosecution. Local newspaper editorials
made that observation during the hearing. But more
importantly, the PCRA hearing transcript shows that
Sabo refused to grant any subpoenas to the defense to
compel witness testimony, and that the judge repeatedly
cut off lines of questioning of witnesses by defense
attorneys when it appeared they were about to undermine
the case. One witness who told of being pressured to
lie at the trial, found herself arrested in the
courtroom immediately following her testimony, while
she was still on the witness stand. She was led off in
handcuffs with the judge's blessing on a check-kiting
charge, despite a pledge by her attorney to have her
appear on the charge--normally a routine procedure. If
the appellate panel rules in favor of this claim, Abu-
Jamal would not get a new trial, but would get a
reopened or a new PCRA, probably in federal instead of
state court. At such a hearing, new evidence of
innocence could be presented, and witnesses from the
original trial and the earlier PCRA hearing could be
further questioned and old testimony challenged.

Abu-Jamal, while still held in solitary confinement on
Pennsylvania's death row at the insistence of
Philadelphia District Attorney Lynn Abraham, is at this
moment not facing the death penalty. Federal District
Judge Yohn ruled in 2001 that a poorly worded jury
verdict form and equally poor instructions from Judge
Sabo during the trial's penalty phase left jurors
thinking, incorrectly, that they could consider no
mitigating circumstances in deciding on his sentence
unless they all agreed on it. In fact, under current
law, if any one juror finds a mitigating circumstance,
it has to be weighed in their collective decision,
which must itself be unanimous for a death penalty.
While it is unlikely that the Third Circuit judges will
overturn Judge Yohn's revocation of Abu-Jamal's death
sentence, which was well reasoned and based upon solid
US Supreme Court precedent, the DA's office is making
the effort, claiming that the precedent doesn't apply
in his case.

In fact, over the course of Abu-Jamal's more than two-
decade-long appeals process, the courts have shown a
willingness to create special exceptions that apply
only to Abu-Jamal.

One example of what might be called "The Mumia Rule"
occurred in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The state's
top judges in 1986 overturned a death sentence in 1986
where McGill, the same prosecutor in Abu-Jamal's case,
had made the same closing statement to jurors at the
conclusion of a murder trial presided over by Judge
Sabo, the same trial judge who presided in Abu-Jamal's
case. The state's top court, declaring that the
prosecutor's language had "minimize[ed] the jury's
sense of responsibility for a verdict of death,"
ordered a new trial. Three years later in 1989, despite
this precedent, the Court reversed itself, though,
upholding Abu-Jamal's conviction. Eleven years later,
Pennsylvania's highest court reversed track again,
barring such language by prosecutors "in all future
trials."

Another example of this judicial "special handling"
where Abu-Jamal's case is concerned, involves the right
of allocution =C3=82=C2=AC the right of the convicted to make a
statement without challenge before sentencing. One
month before initially upholding Abu-Jamal's conviction
in March 1989, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a
ruling stating the right of allocution is of "ancient
origin" and any failure to permit a defendant to plead
for mercy required reversal of sentence. Abu-Jamal's
appeal claimed Judge Sabo, by allowing the prosecutor
to question Abu-Jamal on the stand after the convicted
defendant had made such a statement to jurors, violated
his allocution right during the '82 trial. The state's
high court, however -- for the first time in its
history -- ruled that the "right of allocution does not
exist in the penalty phase of capital murder
prosecution."

This flip-flopping on allocution, acceptable language
for prosecutors and other legal precedents led Amnesty
International to conclude in its 2000 report on Abu-
Jamal's case that the state's highest court improperly
invents new standards of procedure "to apply it to one
case only: that of Mumia Abu-Jamal."

Justice, that is to say, has not always been blind in
this case.

Indeed, the Abu-Jamal case has always been as much
about politics as it has been about law. During his
sentencing hearing, Prosecutor McGill, over the
strenuous objection of the defense, read from and
questioned Abu-Jamal about a 12-year-old Philadelphia
Inquirer article written about him when he had been
just 15, in which he had quoted Mao Tse-tung as saying
"power flows from the barrel of a gun." Although Abu-
Jamal made it clear in the actual article, and during
questioning by the prosecutor, that he was using that
line to refer to the power of the police in
Philadelphia in the early 1970s, the prosecutor told
jurors that the child's words had referred to killing
police.

Since the trial, the Fraternal Order of Police, the
national police union, has openly lobbied hard for Abu-
Jamal's execution, endorsing judicial candidates who
favor the death penalty, while opposing those who
oppose it, and holding annual demonstrations supporting
his death, and even working successfully to prevent
Abu-Jamal from having his commentaries from prison
broadcast on Philadelphia radio stations. On the other
side, a movement condemning Abu-Jamal's conviction and
demanding his freedom or a new trial has spread around
the globe.

Such political action has certainly played a role in
the decisions made by Pennsylvania's politicized
judges, all of whom are elected and must periodically
return to face voters. But the prevailing view among
attorneys is that such political pressures play a
lesser role in the federal court system, where judges
are generally better qualified and are appointed for
life, and particularly at the appellate level, where
most judges remain until they retire or die.

One indication that the appellate court may not be so
vulnerable to political pressure came in 1998, in a
case brought by Abu-Jamal protesting the opening of his
lawyer's correspondence with him in prison. Prison
authorities had opened his lawyers' mail in 1995 and,
learning of his defense strategy for an upcoming PCRA
hearing, passed the news along to then Gov. Tom Ridge,
who rushed through a death warrant. This meant Abu-
Jamal was facing an execution date only weeks from the
hearing-a situation Judge Sabo repeatedly used as an
excuse for rushing the proceeding. The Third Circuit
ruled that opening of inmates' legal mail was illegal.
The Third Circuit also ruled in Abu-Jamal's favor in a
case establishing his First Amendment right to write
and publish from prison.

And so this case, which began one cold dark morning in
December 1981, now moves to what could be the final
confrontation.

However the three judge panel rules, history is likely
to be made this Thursday in the legal showdown between
Abu-Jamal's attorney Robert R. Bryan and Assistant
District Attorney Hugh Burns, and by Third Circuit
Judges Scirica, Ambro and Cowen.

I have to agree. I have no affection for Falwell, but I am deeply troubled by anyone rejoicing at another's death. Feel relieved, fine. But revel in it? It's a slippery slope, my friends.

Re: Falwell and 9/11--


Mark Bingham on flight 93 was gay. He was clearly one of the brave ones that day (in a situation where so much was unclear, and so much has been fodder for propaganda).

But you will notice that mainstream media's heavily subsidized, ad-free propaganda, THE PATH TO 9/1l (sponsored & funded by the far right, aimed at fictionalizing the history of 9/11, and teamed up with Scholastic Books to perpetrate this fraud through the systematic miseducation of millions of American schoolchildren) has no place for someone like Mark Bingham.

Falwell is dead but those who made and paid for that film (his spawn) are alive and well and ready to shout "Let's roll" to the next nightmare in the name of "anti-terror" and "family values."

Many of us fought against the network and msm and Scholastic and consequently those new "histories" of 9/11 never made it into U. S. classrooms.

Keep fighting.

There is a big difference.
  Falwell actively worked to cause harm to gay people; they never did anything to harm him.

  In any case, it's a funny to question coming from someone who hails from Slaughter.

http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10806.html

(From Craig Smith: Smithcraft Press)

I have to admit, writing about Falwell’s death poses an awkward challenge
for me. When I worked at Americans United for Separation of Church and State
for several years, I read Falwell’s materials, I listened to his speeches, I
watched his interviews, and got a real sense for who this man was and what
he devoted his life to.

In literally every instance, I was repelled and appalled. But is it not
callous to bash a man just hours after his death?

I have another idea — I’ll document Jerry Falwell’s professional life and
let his record speak for itself.

March 1980: Falwell tells an Anchorage rally about a conversation with
President Carter at the White House. Commenting on a January breakfast
meeting, Falwell claimed to have asked Carter why he had “practicing
homosexuals” on the senior staff at the White House. According to Falwell,
Carter replied, “Well, I am president of all the American people, and I
believe I should represent everyone.” When others who attended the White
House event insisted that the exchange never happened, Falwell responded
that his account “was not intended to be a verbatim report,” but rather an
“honest portrayal” of Carter’s position.

August 1980: After Southern Baptist Convention President Bailey Smith tells
a Dallas Religious Right gathering that “God Almighty does not hear the
prayer of a Jew,” Falwell gives a similar view. “I do not believe,” he told
reporters, “that God answers the prayer of any unredeemed Gentile or Jew.”
After a meeting with an American Jewish Committee rabbi, he changed course,
telling an interviewer on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “God hears the prayers
of all persons…. God hears everything.”

July 1984: Falwell is forced to pay gay activist Jerry Sloan $5,000 after
losing a court battle. During a TV debate in Sacramento, Falwell denied
calling the gay-oriented Metropolitan Community Churches “brute beasts” and
“a vile and Satanic system” that will “one day be utterly annihilated and
there will be a celebration in heaven.” When Sloan insisted he had a tape,
Falwell promised $5,000 if he could produce it. Sloan did so, Falwell
refused to pay and Sloan successfully sued. Falwell appealed, with his
attorney charging that the Jewish judge in the case was prejudiced. He lost
again and was forced to pay an additional $2,875 in sanctions and court
fees.

October 1987: The Federal Election Commission fines Falwell for transferring
$6.7 million in funds intended for his ministry to political committees.

February 1988: The U.S. Supreme Court strikes down a $200,000 jury award to
Falwell for “emotional distress” he suffered because of a Hustler magazine
parody. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, usually a Falwell favorite,
wrote the unanimous opinion in Hustler v. Falwell, ruling that the First
Amendment protects free speech.

February 1993: The Internal Revenue Service determines that funds from
Falwell’s Old Time Gospel Hour program were illegally funneled to a
political action committee. The IRS forced Falwell to pay $50,000 and
retroactively revoked the Old Time Gospel Hour’s tax-exempt status for
1986-87.

March 1993: Despite his promise to Jewish groups to stop referring to
America as a “Christian nation,” Falwell gives a sermon saying, “We must
never allow our children to forget that this is a Christian nation. We must
take back what is rightfully ours.”

1994-1995: Falwell is criticized for using his “Old Time Gospel Hour” to
hawk a scurrilous video called “The Clinton Chronicles” that makes a number
of unsubstantiated charges against President Bill Clinton — among them that
he is a drug addict and that he arranged the murders of political enemies in
Arkansas. Despite claims he had no ties to the project, evidence surfaced
that Falwell helped bankroll the venture with $200,000 paid to a group
called Citizens for Honest Government (CHG). CHG’s Pat Matrisciana later
admitted that Falwell and he staged an infomercial interview promoting the
video in which a silhouetted reporter said his life was in danger for
investigating Clinton. (Matrisciana himself posed as the reporter.) “That
was Jerry’s idea to do that,” Matrisciana recalled. “He thought that would
be dramatic.”

November 1997: Falwell accepts $3.5 million from a front group representing
controversial Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon to ease Liberty University’s
financial woes.

April 1998: Confronted on national television with a controversial quote
from America Can Be Saved!, a published collection of his sermons, Falwell
denies having written the book or had anything to do with it. In the 1979
work, Falwell wrote, “I hope to live to see the day when, as in the early
days of our country, we won’t have any public schools. The churches will
have taken them over again and Christians will be running them. What a happy
day that will be!” Despite Falwell’s denial, Sword of the Lord Publishing,
which produced the book, confirms that Falwell wrote it.

January 1999: Falwell tells a pastors’ conference in Kingsport, Tenn., that
the Antichrist prophesied in the Bible is alive today and “of course he’ll
be Jewish.”

February 1999: Falwell becomes the object of nationwide ridicule after his
National Liberty Journal newspaper issues a “parents alert” warning that
Tinky Winky, a character on the popular PBS children’s show “Teletubbies,”
might be gay.

September 2001: Falwell blames Americans for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
“The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not
be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make
God mad. I really believe that the Pagans, and the abortionists, and the
feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make
that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of
them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face
and say, ‘You helped this happen.’”

November 2005: Falwell spearheads campaign to resist “war on Christmas.”

February 2007: Falwell describes global warming as a conspiracy orchestrated
by Satan, liberals, and The Weather Channel.

Say what you will about the man and his life, but he leaves behind a
colorful background.

Paul,

The most immediate difference I see is that his statement was motivational hate speech aimed at the living.  It was a prescription for his followers to base their  actions on when they encounter gays as well as a foundational belief to teach their children.

The "celebrating" I see on this list is postmortem and isn't a celebration so much as a collective sigh of "good riddance" in the memory of someone who perpetuated an aggressive hate mentality and caused the homosexuality community, as well as people from other religious faiths, much real life grief and  pain.  The articulation of that is important.

When someone like Conrad uses his emailed "celebration" as a platform to share the real life effects of Falwell's hate speech that he experienced, are we actually overlooking *that point* and focusing on the idea that Conrad is somehow encouraging death?

The connection being made here is that while Falwell's hate speech truly did have painful consequences -- and Conrad's is just one example -- it's being implied here that by articulating a relief that this guy no longer exists -- and most importantly, the accountable Why's of this sentiment --  that by stating how Falwell caused others pain upon his death is the same kind of hate that Falwell encouraged against the living ---

That equation assumes that those who express relief over Falwell's death will now wish death upon people who cause us pain -- in turn, we are being admonished to "not wish death on anyone" -- that is a very presumptuous leap about our morals that negates the critiques Falwell's life truly deserves while simultaneously putting the person who dares to articulate the harm experienced on the lower moral ground for somehow "encouraging death".  I'm not into that equation.  It's too tidy and p.c. and reminds me of the generic aphorisms my pastor would provide in the face of a complicated situation.

Critiques on the heels of Falwell's death are learning tools, and in my opinion, Adam's list and Conrad's account have been the most productive in shedding light on why it is okay not to feel and speak with the usual reverence or respect in the face of each person's death as well as understanding the legacy his followers will be acting upon.

(From Craig Smith: Smithcraft Press)

I have to admit, writing about Falwellï¿½s death poses an awkward challenge
for me. When I worked at Americans United for Separation of Church and State
for several years, I read Falwellï¿½s materials, I listened to his speeches, I
watched his interviews, and got a real sense for who this man was and what
he devoted his life to.

In literally every instance, I was repelled and appalled. But is it not
callous to bash a man just hours after his death?

I have another idea ï¿½ Iï¿½ll document Jerry Falwellï¿½s professional life and
let his record speak for itself.

March 1980: Falwell tells an Anchorage rally about a conversation with
President Carter at the White House. Commenting on a January breakfast
meeting, Falwell claimed to have asked Carter why he had ï¿½practicing
homosexualsï¿½ on the senior staff at the White House. According to Falwell,
Carter replied, ï¿½Well, I am president of all the American people, and I
believe I should represent everyone.ï¿½ When others who attended the White
House event insisted that the exchange never happened, Falwell responded
that his account ï¿½was not intended to be a verbatim report,ï¿½ but rather an
ï¿½honest portrayalï¿½ of Carterï¿½s position.

August 1980: After Southern Baptist Convention President Bailey Smith tells
a Dallas Religious Right gathering that ï¿½God Almighty does not hear the
prayer of a Jew,ï¿½ Falwell gives a similar view. ï¿½I do not believe,ï¿½ he told
reporters, ï¿½that God answers the prayer of any unredeemed Gentile or Jew.ï¿½
After a meeting with an American Jewish Committee rabbi, he changed course,
telling an interviewer on NBCï¿½s ï¿½Meet the Pressï¿½ that ï¿½God hears the prayers
of all personsï¿½. God hears everything.ï¿½

July 1984: Falwell is forced to pay gay activist Jerry Sloan $5,000 after
losing a court battle. During a TV debate in Sacramento, Falwell denied
calling the gay-oriented Metropolitan Community Churches ï¿½brute beastsï¿½ and
ï¿½a vile and Satanic systemï¿½ that will ï¿½one day be utterly annihilated and
there will be a celebration in heaven.ï¿½ When Sloan insisted he had a tape,
Falwell promised $5,000 if he could produce it. Sloan did so, Falwell
refused to pay and Sloan successfully sued. Falwell appealed, with his
attorney charging that the Jewish judge in the case was prejudiced. He lost
again and was forced to pay an additional $2,875 in sanctions and court
fees.

October 1987: The Federal Election Commission fines Falwell for transferring
$6.7 million in funds intended for his ministry to political committees.

February 1988: The U.S. Supreme Court strikes down a $200,000 jury award to
Falwell for ï¿½emotional distressï¿½ he suffered because of a Hustler magazine
parody. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, usually a Falwell favorite,
wrote the unanimous opinion in Hustler v. Falwell, ruling that the First
Amendment protects free speech.

February 1993: The Internal Revenue Service determines that funds from
Falwellï¿½s Old Time Gospel Hour program were illegally funneled to a
political action committee. The IRS forced Falwell to pay $50,000 and
retroactively revoked the Old Time Gospel Hourï¿½s tax-exempt status for
1986-87.

March 1993: Despite his promise to Jewish groups to stop referring to
America as a ï¿½Christian nation,ï¿½ Falwell gives a sermon saying, ï¿½We must
never allow our children to forget that this is a Christian nation. We must
take back what is rightfully ours.ï¿½

1994-1995: Falwell is criticized for using his ï¿½Old Time Gospel Hourï¿½ to
hawk a scurrilous video called ï¿½The Clinton Chroniclesï¿½ that makes a number
of unsubstantiated charges against President Bill Clinton ï¿½ among them that
he is a drug addict and that he arranged the murders of political enemies in
Arkansas. Despite claims he had no ties to the project, evidence surfaced
that Falwell helped bankroll the venture with $200,000 paid to a group
called Citizens for Honest Government (CHG). CHGï¿½s Pat Matrisciana later
admitted that Falwell and he staged an infomercial interview promoting the
video in which a silhouetted reporter said his life was in danger for
investigating Clinton. (Matrisciana himself posed as the reporter.) ï¿½That
was Jerryï¿½s idea to do that,ï¿½ Matrisciana recalled. ï¿½He thought that would
be dramatic.ï¿½

November 1997: Falwell accepts $3.5 million from a front group representing
controversial Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon to ease Liberty Universityï¿½s
financial woes.

April 1998: Confronted on national television with a controversial quote
from America Can Be Saved!, a published collection of his sermons, Falwell
denies having written the book or had anything to do with it. In the 1979
work, Falwell wrote, ï¿½I hope to live to see the day when, as in the early
days of our country, we wonï¿½t have any public schools. The churches will
have taken them over again and Christians will be running them. What a happy
day that will be!ï¿½ Despite Falwellï¿½s denial, Sword of the Lord Publishing,
which produced the book, confirms that Falwell wrote it.

January 1999: Falwell tells a pastorsï¿½ conference in Kingsport, Tenn., that
the Antichrist prophesied in the Bible is alive today and ï¿½of course heï¿½ll
be Jewish.ï¿½

February 1999: Falwell becomes the object of nationwide ridicule after his
National Liberty Journal newspaper issues a ï¿½parents alertï¿½ warning that
Tinky Winky, a character on the popular PBS childrenï¿½s show ï¿½Teletubbies,ï¿½
might be gay.

September 2001: Falwell blames Americans for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
ï¿½The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not
be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make
God mad. I really believe that the Pagans, and the abortionists, and the
feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make
that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of
them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face
and say, ï¿½You helped this happen.ï¿½ï¿½

November 2005: Falwell spearheads campaign to resist ï¿½war on Christmas.ï¿½

February 2007: Falwell describes global warming as a conspiracy orchestrated
by Satan, liberals, and The Weather Channel.

Say what you will about the man and his life, but he leaves behind a
colorful background.

A couple of people back channeled me to
inform me that not all born-again christians
are Jerry Falwell.

And frankly I'm not interested in having that
conversation on the back channel.

It's just as important to talk about those
born-again christians who are not followers
of Jerry Falwell and the like.

Who comes to mind right away as being
someone with the same media power as
Falwell would be Tammy Faye (formerly
Tammy Faye Baker of the PTL Club (The
Praise the Lord Club)).

If you think you have Tammy Faye figured
out without really knowing who she is, and
think that she's just another small-minded
Jesus freak, you're wrong.  The documentary
THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE is one of
the best documentaries about the last three
decades of evangelical christianity in America.
Jerry Falwell of course comes up quite a bit.
Tammy Faye was his adversary not only
because she was a strong outspoken woman,
but because she actually walked her talk.
Her ministry was a threat to the Moral Majority
because the PTL practiced tolerance, and
fully embraced compassion.

Tammy Faye was the first person in history
to interview a gay man dying of AIDS on
the television.  Jerry Falwell realized her
enormous power and influence, and set out
to destroy her and her husband's ministry.
And Falwell won his war against Tammy Faye,
and consumed her congregation, her money,
her ministry, and the power behind it.  And in
turn handed the country over to Ronald Reagan
and George Bush Sr. twice.  And we're living
with that legacy today.

If you've never seen the documentary
THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE, please think
about doing so today.  It might open your
mind in ways you hadn't expected.  It is
narrated by Tammy Faye's good friend
(THE ONE AND ONLY) RuPaul.  And before
anyone else back channels to ask, NO, I'm
not a christian, or buddhist, or jewish, or
any other religion.  My respect and admiration
for Tammy Faye has nothing to do with a
shared belief system, it has to do with giving
respect and admiration where it is due.  She
risked her ENTIRE life for defending queers
and other outsiders, and she's amazing!

There's no doubt that without Tammy Faye
out there doing battle with Falwell and Pat
Robertson and Jimmy Swaggert on their
very own turf, that things would be much
MUCH worse than they are!  She is a brave
human being, and there's no one like her!

For the Love of Tammy Faye, and to the
death of her sworn enemy Jerry Falwell,
CAConrad

Let me add to this conversation 2 subjects
which converge:  Festival, the Body.

My good friend Carol Mirakove has this truly
brilliant set of ideas swirling around the idea
of protest involving Festival.  In short she
hits on the importance of MAKING the protest
a celebration, a place of meeting out of joy,
even though there's so much fear wrapped
around the subjects being protested.  For very
good reasons (as you can imagine once your
mind starts thinking about this) she calls for
us to do Festival when gathering to protest,
such as making the space welcome to all
and everyone, making the space conducive
to clear and focused concentration on the
protest target, etc., and so on.

I'm simplifying here, but Carol is working on
this information herself at the moment.  And
she's on to something BIG in my opinion!

About the Body, it's important to celebrate the
death of Jerry Falwell (in my opinion, and I have
not discussed with Carol how she feels about
the death of Jerry Falwell, so don't confuse what
I'm about to say with her ideas of Festival) because
Falwell, Pat Robertson, and their good friends
Karl Rove, the Bushes, Reagan, etc. to evil, have
made their careers off a very old table of ideas
for control.  IF YOU CAN CONVINCE A GROUP
OF PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY LIVE THEIR LIVES
BEING AFRAID OF THEIR BODIES, you have them.
Those people now belong to you.

Our bodies are CENTRAL, they are the axis each
of us has to spin on.

Our bodies are our only REAL thing to keep ahold
of on the planet.  And if these men can (and they
have, and have done so very successfully) convince
people to BE AFRAID of being queer (which brings
hundreds of layers to this conversation about both
the body, and control of the body) and AFRAID for
"reckless women" who would want to "murder" the
unborn, then, frankly, WOW, you really have them.

Election after election in this country (and I'm NOT
just talking about presidential, I'm talking local, I'm
talking even school board kind of local) has been
built and WON on the basis of FEAR and CONTROL
of the Body.

Celebration for me of Falwell's death is essential
because my body has been at stake.  The bodies of
those I Love have been at stake.  The bodies of you
and your own Loved ones have been at stake.  To
celebrate the death Falwell's body is to TAKE BACK
the Body our own way, to live in our own truth.

Since before I was born Jerry Falwell has been working
this campaign of FEAR OF THE BODY.  It really is
amazing any of us ever make up our own minds about
our bodies.

To celebrate the life of the Body is to not live in fear.
To celebrate the Body is the beginning of taking away
the power these men have taken from us,

Falwell's nonsense about gays and other groups is the worse example of misplaced imagination I've seen in a long time.  At first, I thought he was advocating genocide for gays.  But, apparently, he expected this to happen in some kind of vengeful Heaven no true Christian would recognize as anything but a sick fantasy.  That people like Falwell were and are listened to by many gullible bigots and simple-minded believers in a non-existent Christian God makes it only human when we, who live quite well intellectually and emotionally outside belief in the Judeo-Christian God, feel a moment of enjoyment when such a bad influence on the politics and religious thought in this country can add nothing more to his miserable legacy.

Those of us with roots in the DC/Northern Virginia region and long memories
recall Falwell's earlier period of political activism, during which he
campaigned furiously to maintain segregation -- and his own Thomas Road Baptist
church was indeed closed to African American Baptists -- this was just one of
the reasons my own Baptist parents joined a church in D.C. instead of
Arlington, where they had bought a home.

In later years, Falwell pronounced himself a defender of Martin Luther King's
true vision, confessed that his earlier citation of scripture in defense of
racial inequality had been wrong, and railed against affirmative action -- how
much had he really changed?

If nothing else, finding yourself making a public denunciation of your own
earlier positions should be a humbling experience -- You'd think it might teach
you to be a bit less, well, fundamentalist -- Jerry Falwell, sorry to say, had
no such humility -- He has much to answer for -- If he is in fact, as his faith
told him, with his creator this morning, he's got a lot of explaining to do --

*Call for papers - LEA Dispersive Anatomies*
*-------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Leonardo Electronic Almanac (ISSN No: 1071-4391) is inviting papers =
and
artworks that address dispersion - dispersion of bodies, objects,
landscapes, networks, virtual and real worlds.

A fundamental shift in the way we view the world is underway: the
abandonment of discrete objects, and objecthood itself. The world is now
plural, and the distinction between real and virtual is becoming
increasingly blurred, with troubling consequences within the geopolitical
register. This shift is related to a cultural change that emphasizes =
digital
deconstruction over analog construction: a photograph for example can be
accessed and transformed, pixel by pixel, cities can be taken apart by
gerrymandering or eminent domain, and our social networks are replete with
names and images that problematize friendship, sexuality, and culture
itself. One issue that emerges here: Are we networking or are we networked?=

Are we networks ourselves?

LEA is interested in texts and works that deal with this fundamental shift
in new and illuminating ways. Specifically, anything from essays through
multimedia through networks themselves may be considered. We're particularl=
y
interested in submissions that deal with the incoherency of the world, and
how to address it.
*Key topics of interest
---------------------------------

*Topics of interest might include (but are not limited to):
- Networked warfare in real and virtual worlds.
- The wounded/altered body in real and virtual worlds.
- Transgressive sexualities across borders, sexualities among body-parts,
dismemberments and groups, both real and virtual.

- Critical texts on the transformation of classical narrative - from its
emphasis on an omniscient narrator and coherent plots/characters, to
literatures of incoherency, dispersed narrations, and the jump-cut
exigencies of everyday life.

- Deleuze/Guattari, TAZ, and other phenomena at the border of networking.
- Internet visions and their abandonment or fulfillment.
- The haunting of the world by ghosts, virtual beings, dreams and =
nightmares
that never resolve.

- The geopolitical collapse of geopolitics.
- Military empires as scattershot entrepreneurial corporations.

Dispersion has two vectors: the breakup or breakdown of coherent objects;
and the subsequent attempt to corral, curtail, or recuperate from this
breakdown. How do we deal with networks that are constantly coalescing and
disappearing? Where are we in the midst of this? In an era of pre-emptive
culture, is guerilla warfare to be accompanied by guerilla culture as the
order of the day?
*Want to be kept informed?*

His deeply-held beliefs changed as needed so often that it's
difficult to credit him with any deeply held beliefs other than the
exercise of power. Something over 20 years ago, when I was at VCCA, a
few miles from Lynchburg, I attended Liberty Baptist Church for one
of his televised sermons. Aside from huckstering for pennies from the
impoverished for his bible concordance he spent the entire time
touting his power: how many churches in all, how many new that year,
how many countries, and what a huge gain there had been since the
humble origins of the congregation. Not one word about religion as
normally understood--it was closer to a report by a corporate CEO.
The message of which seemed to be, see, you humble people, you're a
part of all this power, a stockholder. At the end of the sermon he
was surprised by his assistant, who announced that it was Falwell's
50th birthday and presented him with a present from the faithful: the
numbers 50, two feet tall, spelled out in kruger-rands. When the
assistant tried to take the present back in order in order to rest it
someplace (a kruger-rand weighs a full ounce, and there were a lot of
them), Falwell grasped it to his chest, smiling, and said, "you're
not taking this away," doing what was supposed to be a comic turn,
and the audience, who appeared none too prosperous, laughed
uproariously. He had just been telling them that he knew the few
bucks a week for his concordance would be a sacrifice for many of
them, "but think what your soul's salvation is worth."

I don't care if he was good to children and puppies, he was a monster
of a familiar sort. How does one innoculate the powerless against
this sort of thing when their lives have so few satisfactions except
the vicarious participation in celebrity and power?

I also agree.  And I'm also recalling the recent reminder from the
listserv facilitators about the governing ethics for this list.

Onward.

It was refreshing last night to hear Christopher Hitchens (who I usually
cannot deal with, pro-Iraq invasion, etc.) come out so strongly against
Falwell's pro-Israel/Christian link. Defining that odd coalition of the
Christian right with Israel's Likkud (sp?) as the primary reason for the end
of the Peace Process in the Mideast. His assumption is that the Bush
Christian fundamentalist base (Falwell et al)  is key to Bush's 5 year
refusal to insist on real negotiations and a resolution to the conflict. The
preference being for an enflamed Rapture and Christian ascent created by
endless war, etc. I understand Jews are left behind in this final 'roll
out.'

Condi Rice apparently is trying to put another face on the situation. I am
afraid she is already a snowball in her own Administration's commitment to
sustaining some sort of hell on earth of which she and her colleagues have
done such a splendid job!

     When first receiving this list, an immediately striking feature is the=
 frequent obituaries of poets, primarily, as well as such Poetics-related f=
igures as El Diablo Falwell.  (Often imagine Dr Bernstein in his down time =
working for fun on updating his "morgue" files--keeping the obits  as buffe=
d & au courant as possible--).     The obituaries often are accompanied  ("=
followed" implies too long a gap in response--in this internet reality--) b=
y a sudden outpouring of discourse, and the dusting off of unfinished homag=
es--snatches of memoirs--rare translations--old fotos--interconnections wit=
h such and such and so and so--perhaps an already waiting EPC page--a speci=
al journal issue--or several-- a conference--or simply a memorial reading .=
 . . and the start of an archive on line--or somewhere in physical space--a=
nalyses of individuals poems or books--the situating and contextualizing of=
 a career . . . a person seldom thought of or mentioned in life overnight i=
n death has become a "going concern"-- "a sadly neglected figure"--(the fau=
lt of the Establishment etc--)--"an example of triumphant endurance"--all s=
orts of stock roles await the pliantly dead actor-poet/poetics-figure--ever=
ything from noble victim to inspiriational heroine--to the monsters villifi=
ed for their evil doings in categories of various sorts--      After all, i=
f it is a good time to kick a person when they are down--how much better to=
 do so when they are DEAD!!!       And if a person was rather ignored in th=
eir lifetime--what better time to build them up than when dead--and one may=
 receive the credit for handling the public relatios and the design of the =
monument, the construction of the pyramids--the lighting of the Eternal Fla=
me--the preservation of the scrolls . . .          Just yesterday for examp=
le--al the discussion over the death of Rev Falwell--had within in it a sma=
ller thread concerning the search for the SF Chronicle front page obit of R=
obert Duncan--          Thanks to Linda Russo for what she wrote regarding =
the books for the schools--it was great to read of something powerful and e=
ffective like this being done---         I had been talking with some frien=
ds about friends of ours that just recently died, in the last two and a hal=
f to three weeks---(a murder, a suicide, an overdose and one person in thei=
r sleep due to complications caused by addictions--the murderer of the murd=
ered man is a friend of ours, too--to make matters worse--)--what might we =
each be doing to remember our friends by--in living--          In today's N=
Y Times after six years it is finally dawning on the US govt --and only bec=
uase the Taliban are making the most money from it now--that the drug traff=
icing in Afghanistan is out of control--gee--right under their noses and th=
ey just didn't see it l these years--that traffic alot of it comes straight=
 to the streets of the good old USA--kil the Afgans there and kill the unwa=
nted ones here--      Jerry Falwell spoke of genocide.  Dershowtiz famous l=
awyer, Profesor at Harvard has called for genocide of the Palestinians.  Th=
e ground one walks on in the US is ground gained by genocide.  Here in Milw=
aukee is the Black Holocaust Museum.  The health care system is in many way=
s becoming a program of eugenics.  CEOS rob billions, destory the enviromen=
t,, pollute the airs and waters--and get bonuses, tax cuts and most likely =
estate tax changes, too.  More and more poverty stricken people, more and m=
ore addicts, prisoners, badly educated ill trained workers barely able to f=
ind a minum wage job, the hatred and persecution of "illegal immigrants" of=
 American Muslims, of Arab-Americans and Arab residents, students--the isol=
ationism of a nation--police brutality--the Injustice System--continued imp=
risonment of Leonard Peltier--infra-structures falling apart--New Orleans--=
        One could go on and on and on--        So Jerry Falwell is dead and=
 there will be some parties and jubilation . . . plenty of people wil proba=
bly celebrate when say George Steinbrenner dies--or someone's really rotten=
 uncle or evil step parent--or the really mean and harassing neighbor the s=
treet--        Conrad--I can't believe you never heard of festivals and pro=
tests going together--!!--my God--they have since the dawn of time--       =

I have been asked to teach a film class next year. I've often incorporated
film into lit and writing classes I have taught, but I've never taught a
specific film class before. I would love to receive suggestions about books
any of you use in such classes, including single-author works and
collections of film criticism and theory. The course will be a general
introduction to film studies, and viewings will include experimental film
(Stan Brakhage, Maya Deren, etc.), early film (Eisenstein, Chaplin, Keaton,
etc.), and representative works from various countries and genres of film.
I probably don't need to assign a book for students at all, but I'm
thinking about it. Please send suggestions to me at <chax@theriver.com>,
unless people think this is an appropriate topic for this list-serve.

SF CHRONICLE Thursday, February 4th, 1988 pgs A1, A4

"Renowned Poet Robert Duncan Dies in S.F." by Kevin Leary

San Francisco poet Robert Duncan, a commanding figure in Bay Area
literary circles and a major influence in American poetry for many
years, died at his home yesterday of congestive heart failure, He was
69.

Considered one of the great lyric poets of his generation, Duncan was
the author of 14 books of poetry and a well-received collection of
notes, talks and essays on poetics entitled "Fictive Certainties."

"I make poetry as other men make war or make states or revolutions,"
he wrote once, describing his radical, experimental, and sometimes
erotic free verse.

In 1985, Duncan was presented the first National Poetry Award. The
year before, he had received the Bay Area Book Reviewers Association's
Fred Cody Award for Lifetime achievement.

His 1984 work, "Ground Work: Before the War, " was a finalist for the
Pulitzer Prize in 1985 and was nominated for a National Book Critics
Circle Award.

"He wrote very difficult but very beautiful poetry, " said Peter
Glassgold, Duncan's editor at the New York publishing house of New
Directions. "He very much wrote out of the American tradition."

San Francisco poet Michael Palmer described Duncan as a "commanding
figure of the San Francisco Renaissance," a movement among local poets
in the 1940s and 1950s who attempted to restore the visionary
character of high romantic poetry to the contemporary scene.

In a 1985 review of "Ground Work: Before the War," Berkeley novelist
and poet Ron Loewinsohn called Duncan "a revolutionary poet who-- far
from attempting to overthrow the past-- works to rescue a lost
continuity with it, with all the forces of the past (its literature,
its history, its beliefs) that might restore some vigor and harmony to
a present that's increasingly spiritless and oppressive."

"He was a model of a person who dedicated his life to art, which was
his vocation in the very highest meaning of the word," said
Loewinsohn, a professor of English at the University of California at
Berkeley.

Loewinsohn remembered Duncan as a courageous artist who stood up for
his beliefs--- active in Berkeley's 1964 Free Speech Movement, opposed
to the war in Vietnam and outspokenly gay at a time when a person
could be jailed for homosexualaity in some states.

Duncan's life was dramatic and difficult from the day he was born, on
Jan. 7, 1919. His mother died as the result of a difficult birth.

"She died when I was born," he wrote, "because my head was too big,
tearing my way through he agony to life."

He was given up for adoption by his father. He was adopted by a Bay
Area couple, theosophists whose beliefs rubbed off on the child and
later appeared in his poetry.

"The theosophist tradition interpreted the world as a text, and to
read one's life was to read a prophetic book," said Michael Davidson,
a professor of American literature at the University of California at
San Diego, who has written extensively about Duncan.

"Inherent in Duncan's poetics was a powerful emphasis on myth and
story," Davidson said yesterday in a telephone interview.

Duncan studied at the University of California at Berkeley for two
years in the late 1930s before he gave up academia in favor of the
more glamorous and intriguing New York literary circles of Henry
Miller and Anais Nin.

That artistic association was followed by a riotous period of sexual
debauchery, so described by author Ekbert Faas in his biography "Young
Robert Duncan: Portrait of the Poet as a Homosexual in Society."

It was a desperate and dangerous time in his life. He attempted
suicide twice and was once almost killed by a man he had picked up. He
gave up the wild life in 1943 and was briefly married. But he soon
learned that heterosexuality was not for him; the marriage failed
within a few months.

He returned to Berkeley in the late 1940s, attending university
classes on an informal basis, studying medieval art and Renaissance
history, the influence of which showed throughout his later writings.

In the early 1950s, Duncan journeyed to Mallorca, where he lived for
about three years.

After returning to the United States, he taught briefly at Black
Mountain College in North Carolina. There he was associated with a
group of experimental writers who have come to be known as the Black
Mountain poets: they derived their poetics from Ezra pound and William
Carlos Williams.

Duncan then returned to the Bay Area, where he became a central
presence in the San Francisco literary scene as an exuberant and well
loved raconteur and intellectual figure.

From 1979 to 1985, he taught at New College of California in San
Francisco, where he was the guiding spirit behind the school's poetics
program, which tapped the talents of several well-known Bay Area
poets.

Duncan was a Guggenheim fellow in 1963 and own the Harriet Monroe
Memorial prize from Poetry magazine in 1961.

Some of his other published works include "The Opening of the Field"
in 1960, "Roots and Branches" in 1964, "Bending the bow" in 1968 and
"The Sweetness and Greatness of Dante's Divine Comedy" in 1974.

Painter Jess Collins, his companion of 37 years, was at Duncan's
bedside when he died early yesterday.

Duncan's body will be cremated and his ashes scattered at sea. A
memorial service is planned, but a date has not been set.

What a great chance!
For noir, I like A Panorama of American Film Noir, Raymond Borde & Etienne
Chaumeton, published by City Lights.  Then you can show "Double Indemnity,"
"The Postman Always Rings Twice" (there are two Hollywood versions and one
Italian called "Osessione"), even the weird Hemingway's "The Killers" (which
is an interesting example of a very great short story redone for film with a
complicated backstory that didn't exist--the Robert Mitchum version, not the
Ronald Reagan!), etc.
I've got lists.  And I'm sure you do to.

If you're into Satayjit Ray, and I am deeply, try to find his book, which is
sort of a cino-bio of his life as an art student, then a film buff of
Western movies, then a writer/director/musical director of his own films.
The last time I found it was at the U of NM library, so probably U of A has
it.

Oh, you've gotten me started.  I know some doc filmmakers, one of whom, Gene
Rosow, got a PhD in Film Studies at Berkeley, wrote an important film
studies book, then got an National Endowment to go to Cuba to make "The
Roots of Cuban Music" a long time ago.  Little did the government know what
they were financing.  I think Harry Belafonte narrated it.

You don't want me to go on. . . .

Love, Gloria

Hope this helps,

I can suggest an excellent book by Satyajit Ray - Our Films Their Films.
A classic east/west comparative analysis of a language that is called
"cinema".

There's another one from Eric Rohmer which contains his reflections
on several western films (Hollywood and parallel American cinema
included) which I thought could serve as a rich starter.

Thanks, Christophe. I didn't know about the book on Singing Horse. I will
contact them. I think Eli, who is at Temple, is speaking with others there.
Gil's archive is at Penn, but he didn't usually save copies of his own
outgoing letters, so that's not as much help as we might have wanted. We
are in touch with people at PennSound.

cheers!

There are many. His films have been studied in many many universities
worldwide in great details. University of California at Santa Cruz

have a great collection of Ray films and a suitable web resource
(http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/ )



His most famous films are the Apu Trilogy -

1.	Song of the Little Road
2.	The Unvanquished
3.	The World of Apu



I think Kanchenjungha is a beautiful, poetic film that melts the narrative
away. Music Room is another great film that tells a sad tale

of a withering aristrocratic Indian culture in the wake of western
industrialization. I personally like his journey film - The Actor (Nayak),

The lonely Wife(Charulata), a love story and the most shining of them all -
The Chess Players (Shatranj Ki Khilari).



You can also refer to the site filmref.com which I found very helpful.

 Letter to Black America on Palestinian Rights and June 10th March & Rally=
=20



 On 15 May 2007, 22 Black American professors, writers, religious figures, =
and=20
other leaders issued a call to Black America to join in the June 10 March a=
nd=20
rally, and break the silence on the injustices faced by the Palestinian=20
people.  =20

=20

 =20



 To Black America:



It is time for our people to once
again demand that the silence be broken on the injustices faced by the
Palestinian people resulting from the Israeli occupation.On June
10th, the national coalition known as the US Campaign to End the Israeli
Occupation (endtheoccupation.org) will be spearheading a march and
rally to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the beginning of the
illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.=20



We, the signatories of
this appeal, ask that Black America again take a leading role in this effor=
t as
well as the broader work to bring attention to this 40 year travesty of
justice.



United
Nations resolutions have called for the Israeli withdrawal, yet the Israeli
government, with the backing of the USA, has ignored them. The Israeli
government has appropriated Palestinian land in open defiance of
international law and overwhelming international condemnation. =20





Within
the USA
anyone who speaks in favor of Palestinian rights and justice is immediately
condemned as being allegedly anti-Israel (and frequently allegedly
anti-Semitic), shutting down legitimate discussion.  A case in point can be=
 seen in the current
furor surrounding former President Jimmy Carter who was criticized for his
assertion in his best-selling book, Palestine:=20
Peace Not Apartheid, that
Israeli obstructionism lies at the root of the failure to achieve a just
Palestinian/Israeli settlement. =20

As Nobel
prizewinner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has written, "People are scared in the
US,
to say 'wrong is wrong,' because the pro-Israeli lobby is powerful--very
powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God's world! We live in=
 a
moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no
longer exists."=20



Many of
those who most outspokenly agree with President Carter and Archbishop Tutu =
are
American Jews. And many American Jews, including the national organization
Jewish Voice for Peace, will be among those rallying for Palestinian rights=
 on
June 10th - as will many other Americans, including member groups of
the leading anti-war coalition United for Peace and Justice.=20



Leaders
from Black America have repeatedly and historically been among the most out=
spoken
proponents of justice for the Palestinian people.  Our leaders have defende=
d the Palestinian
people's right to full self-determination and an end to the Occupation as
central to peace in the region.  Our
leaders have not criticized the Jewish people but they have expressed outra=
ge
at the Israeli government that collaborated with the apartheid South Africa=
n
government (including in the development of weapons of mass destruction) an=
d
emulated South Africa's
treatment of its Black majority in its own treatment of the Palestinian peo=
ple.




As we
struggle to build our country's support for Palestinian human rights, we wi=
den
the door for both Arab and Black Americans to deal with the issues that joi=
n
them together, as well as those that separate them. We will help to energiz=
e -
and to heal - both communities.=20



June
tenth and Juneteenth: will our struggles lead the way to a new emancipation=
 of
others?  Our own integrity as a people,
let alone our own experience with massive injustice and oppression, demand =
that
we step forward, speak out, and insist on a change in US policy towards the
Palestinian people.  Since when have an
illegally occupied people been wrong in demanding and fighting for their hu=
man
rights and land?  Since when have such
people and their cause not been worthy of our support?



Please
join us on June 10th!

Mark Weiss' Junction Press - as some of you already know - has just release=
d
Walking Theory, my new book of poems. Ron Silliman at  has already given it
a  "to die for" review that I deeply appreciate).

... these are the poems Stephen Vincent has been preparing to write his
entire life. They definitely pass the =B3take the top of your head off=B2 test.
I went cover to cover without even sitting up.
Silliman=B9s Blog, (http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/) May 15, 2007  (Scoot
down a day in order to find it).

Walking Theory  (84 pages, $12)

Wherever you may be about the globe, Junction now has a website
(www.junctionpress.com) to enable online ordering and payment. (Just follow
the alphabetical list of authors down to my name).
Contact me directly, <steph484@pacbell.net>, if you prefer a signed copy!

Bookstores can go straight to Junction or to Small Press Distribution.

I cannot help but throw in a couple of nice back cover blurbs from Bill
Berkson and Beverly Dahlen:

At long last is Walking Theory, Stephen Vincent=B9s observant, large-hearted
poems bundled into book form, engaging architecture, people on the move, th=
e
seasons and other transience, the talk that binds the day: Goodbye,
rhetoric, =B3the desperate,/what can the poem do, walking, step-by-step:/
witness, suffer, hope.=B2 Urbane and companionable, rare virtues flaunted
here, curbside delight.  Bill Berkson

Stephen Vincent's work here preserves and enhances the ancient association
of the foot as measure of the poetic line. In Walking Theory measure become=
s
metaphor:  =B3...foot ever to the ground, image by image, /thought by thought=
,
word by word...=B2 This is the measure of the continuity of a poet=B9s life as
he moves through the days, from the grief-stricken rhythms of the opening
section of elegies to the more expansive tours of the San Francisco
neighborhoods where he lives and works.  Vincent celebrates the beauty of
these familiar landscapes, as well as strange, unexpected and sometimes
mundane details. In a wonderful pun that arises in the midst of the naming
of spring flowers, =B3the dotted eye=B2 suggests the I of linguistic convention
as the seeing, moving body=B9s eye transformed by language. Finally, in this
serious play of words, the poets asks: =B3what can the poem do, walking,
step-by step:=B2 and credo-like responds: =B3witness, suffer, hope.=B2
Beverly Dahlen

Yes, they both quoted the same lines!

Thanks for your interest,

Stephen Vincent

I was thinking, I can understand why C.A. & others
feel gleeful about the death of Jerry Falwell--and
yet, the pile-up of glee & milder happiness & relief
did not constitute for me the loveliest day the
Poetics List has ever seen.

Then I recalled two formidable songs that wish for the
death of hated persons--Bob Dylan's "Masters of War" &
Elvis Costello's "Tramp the Dirt Now".  Since the
second (from  E.C.'s 1989 album "Spike") is no doubt
not as familiar, I will quote the beginning:

I saw a newspaper picture from the political
Campaign
A woman was kissing a child, who was obviously
In pain
She spills with compassion, as that young child's
Face in her hands she grips
Can you imagine all that greed and avarice
Coming down on that child's lips
Well I hope I don't die too soon
I pray the Lord my soul to save
Oh I'll be a good boy, I'm trying so hard to behave
Because there's one thing I know, I'd like to live
Long enough to savour
That's when they finally put you in the ground
I'll stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down
________________________

Especially with the music, this is quite compelling.

Possible conclusion: it's best to shape one's extreme
hatred into a song or poem because that adds another
dimension (?)  Of course if anyone submits a poem to
this List it's at their own peril.

Lost & Found

Show and tell: Torn texts in multiple voices. Fugitive transmissions. Image=
s
and objects lost or abandoned are found and polished. The sound of a slow
train by the green light of half forgotten songs. POEMS ARE FUN, glamour is
made easy. A manual for violence prevention follows ADVANCED TYPING TIPS,
PART 5. Glass negative projections. Offerings from an archive. A slide show
from an abandoned elementary school. What to do when you lose someone. What
to do if you find them. There will be surprises, appearances and absences.
David Gatten, filmmaker, Henry James fan, lover of poems and poets, recent
Guggenheim fellow and aspiring audio book artist, makes bookish films about
letters and libraries and boat and ghosts that are filled with words, some
of which you can read. You can find his films in the permanent collections
of the Whitney Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago but he can rarely
find his glasses. He lives and works by the water in Red Hook, Brooklyn and
Seabrook Island, South Carolina. For tonight's event David has invited some
of his favorite scavengers to present sounds, images and words, either as
they found them or incorporated as elements in compositions of their own
design. Participants include Macgregor Card, Mary Helena Clark, Ellie Ga,
Jenny Perlin, Michael Robinson, Jonathan Schwartz, Phil Solomon and Jessie
Stead. Please go to http://www.poetryproject.com/calendar.php for

... these are the poems Stephen Vincent has been preparing to write his
entire life. They definitely pass the =B3take the top of your head off=B2 test.
I went cover to cover without even sitting up.
Silliman=B9s Blog, (http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/) May 15, 2007  (Scoot
down a day in order to find it).
=20
At long last is Walking Theory, Stephen Vincent=B9s observant, large-hearted
poems bundled into book form, engaging architecture, people on the move, th=
e
seasons and other transience, the talk that binds the day: Goodbye,
rhetoric, =B3the desperate,/what can the poem do, walking, step-by-step:/
witness, suffer, hope.=B2 Urbane and companionable, rare virtues flaunted
here, curbside delight.  Bill Berkson

Stephen Vincent's work here preserves and enhances the ancient association
of the foot as measure of the poetic line. In Walking Theory measure become=
s
metaphor:  =B3...foot ever to the ground, image by image, /thought by thought=
,
word by word...=B2 This is the measure of the continuity of a poet=B9s life as
he moves through the days, from the grief-stricken rhythms of the opening
section of elegies to the more expansive tours of the San Francisco
neighborhoods where he lives and works.  Vincent celebrates the beauty of
these familiar landscapes, as well as strange, unexpected and sometimes
mundane details. In a wonderful pun that arises in the midst of the naming
of spring flowers, =B3the dotted eye=B2 suggests the I of linguistic convention
as the seeing, moving body=B9s eye transformed by language. Finally, in this
serious play of words, the poets asks: =B3what can the poem do, walking,
step-by step:=B2 and credo-like responds: =B3witness, suffer, hope.=B2

Yes, they both quoted the same lines!

blood wandering around the green. when i was covered with blood looking
for don. when i wanted don to scream. when the guard took me to the
hospital. when don kept sleeping. now this seems stupid. most of my work
is stupid. it's the beating that did it. the beating turned me criminal.
it was my second beating but the first reported. if you hit me i'm a

Brian Richards requested that I post the below piece on Dorn - primarily in
answer to Ron Silliman's blog review of Dorn's recently published Way More
West - and when I suggested he might also include, at the end, Silliman's
brief and initial response to it, addressed exclusively to him, he agreed,
so, although I'm aware that it may be against Listserv "ethics" to post
something without its author's expressed permission, which Ron didn't give
and I didn't ask for, I can only say that I'm more interested in the
substance of (this) argument, than I am in List ethics, so, if it be
necessary, remove me.  Please.

Richard's essay -

Dorn Undone

Way More West, reviewed by Ron Silliman on his blog, March 20, 2007
“Black Mountain Breakdown”, August Kleinzahler, New York Times, April, 2007


					1.


Ron Silliman is often an interesting writer, and his blog is a conduit for
certain kinds of helpful information, but I’ve never had a lot of use for
his combative, exclusionary poetics. Had Silliman, in his review of Ed
Dorn’s posthumous Way More West, attacked Dorn for poetic reasons, I would
not have paid much attention since, as shall appear obvious hereafter, I
regard Dorn as a master of American poetry of the First Empire—as opposed to
Imperial American Poetry, which has Charles Bernstein. But Silliman attacked
Dorn’s human nature, and such extra-poetical stereotyping is too obnoxious
to ignore. Farts dissipate; shit hangs around.

The excrescences encumbering the notion of social rectitude are too
disgusting to muck about in; I leave it to Silliman to critique poetry by
means of character assassination, only observing that the absence of candor
and frank appraisal must produce a poetry of, to adopt Silliman’s cant
phrase, quietude. It is shameful to slur a poet because you deplore his
opinions, but to dismiss a major figure on grounds of social maladjustment
is self defeating and inimical to art. Shelley and Whitman were ostracized
by just such posturing Scotch Reviewers. I’ll take Apollonaire, thanks, and
Catullus and Villon and Rochester and Blake. You can have Milton and
Tennyson and all the John Masefield you can stomach.

Silliman says Dorn is “easily [!] the most contentious and controversial of
any of the New Americans”, which makes me wonder if he’s ever heard of Jack
Spicer. Or Kerouac or Ginsberg, or, for that matter, Olson or Creeley. At
least Dorn was never reduced to watching his friends through the window of a
bar from which he’d been 86ed. Dorn never fit “easily” into any group. As
evidence for his contention, Silliman gossips that Dorn, asked to read at a
benefit in 1973, had requested that he be scheduled to appear on stage when
he would be forced to encounter neither Creeley nor Joanne Kyger. This,
Silliman suggests, was done in the spirit of one-upmanship, so Dorn could
read last. Maybe. But, in the summer of ’73, I sat at Richard Grossinger and
Lindy Hough’s kitchen table in Plainfield, Vt, all afternoon with Creeley
and Dorn, who operated in easy comity. Dorn’s personal distaste for Kyger
has been reported in print for some time now, but nobody likes everybody, so
Dorn’s behavior hardly justifies extravagant claims of contention and
controversy. The only notable difference between Dorn and the others I’ve
named above is that none of them ever had anything negative to say about
Silliman or his cohort. But why not give Dorn a chance? From a letter to
Olson in 1964: “I can hardly get along with Creeley but sense that I can
hardly not be a friend….”

Of the poetry itself, Silliman has nothing original to say concerning the
work that appeared in the first Collected Poems (Four Seasons, 1974) or
Gunslinger (collected as ‘Slinger, Wingbow, ’74), but he has plenty to tell
us about the later work, his major objections to which are that it is “all
over the map”, with a “macho attitude toward violence”. Well, Dorn was an
old vines American, after all: vintage ’29. Silliman takes as indicative of
those flaws, though he misquotes it, the following epigrammatic gem:

			one bullet
			is worth
			a thousand bulletins

which Silliman condemns as staking out “a position that captures the Bush
foreign policy in Iraq all too presciently, though I’m sure that’s not what
Dorn intended”. We can ignore the anachronism here, but the question
remains: if Dorn didn’t intend something that hadn’t yet happened, how can
he be charged with fellow traveling? The next question is: has Silliman read
the poem? Take just a minute:

	One picture is worth a thousand words.
	One gram is worth a thousand milligrams.
	one bullet / is worth / a thousand bulletins

							The third of these statements examines the relationship between the
first two in a conceit that is evidently too complex to affect Silliman’s
predisposition to portray Dorn as a political thinker on the troglodyte
order of Dick Cheney, but it won’t wash. It’s just a weak reading of an
acute, telling little masterpiece that, like Picasso’s drawing of Don
Quixote, defines the nature of means without end.

Silliman’s assessment of Dorn’s elegy for Petra Kelley is equally hampered
by bourgeois manners. I won’t quote the poem (you could, look it up) but
here are some of Silliman’s claims:

Item: that “Dorn’s fascination with violence undercuts his green/libertarian
tendencies repeatedly.” Nothing in the poem can be cited in support of this
assertion. But Silliman does score here; Dorn must be cursing in his grave
at being categorized as anything other than a poet, since he thought for
himself and joined no groups, especially none co-opted by interested parties
of any persuasion.

Item: that Dorn may not realize “that more than half of [Kelly’s time in the
U.S.] was spent in Columbus, Georgia”. Is this some kind of code? What does
Columbus stand for other than the object of a certain kind of snobbishness
that Dorn apparently eschewed, but that Silliman does not? At any rate,
Silliman never connects this observation with any critique of the poem.

Item: that “Petra Kelly didn’t shoot herself [Silliman’s emphasis]…& whether
it was a murder-suicide or a joint suicide is one of those unknowables
[would this be a known unknown or an unknown unknown?] of history.” Then he
accuses Dorn of “misreading a sad act of depression and domestic violence”.
I leave it to you to determine just who is doing the misreading here. We
have under discussion a poem, not a reasoned argument, observing that those
who throw themselves against the machine are doomed, while those who
famously abet those acts of self destruction are bankable. Silliman never
approaches the interior values of the poem, a courtesy he routinely extends
to his friends, as for example the careful examination of short vowel
progress in recent poems of Rae Armantrout’s (whose work I admire, and I
mean her no ill in naming her as one of Silliman’s group—I mean only to
suggest that there is an apparent correspondence between those to whom he
gives careful attention and those with whom he has personal links).

No charge seems too petty. Silliman quotes the line “…with sumo champions /
like Gertrude Stein…” as “cheaply explicit homophobia in making fun of
Gertrude Stein’s weight….” How could anyone who has seen Picasso’s portrait
of Stein ensconced, hair pulled back into a bun, not have recognized the
similarity of placid demeanor and enormous, floating presence? Is that
homophobia? Silliman’s attack is ad hominem criticism with a vengeance. The
point of Dorn’s stanza is that only Pound’s anti-semitism was egregious
enough to put such an attitude in bad odor among artists. But that is not
opprobrium enough, evidently, for the attitudinizers of “the fascism of
beehive / conformity”(to quote Dorn from the same poem). I have long
respected Ron Silliman’s perspicacity as a political thinker—his response to
Baudrillard, c. 1989, available through his blog, is especially
prescient—but his standing as arbiter of morals among American poets is, in
my estimation, dismal.


					2.


I have often enjoyed August Kleinzahler’s poems for their modest,
workmanlike clarity. His “Over Gower Street” is very fine. That in mind, I
turned to his NYT review of Way More West with some anticipation that I
might be offered the antidote to Silliman’s nasty blog bite, only to find
the same sanctimonious dismissal: a bow to the precision of the early work,
always careful to attribute its felicities to the influence of Black
Mountain; left-handed praise of Gunslinger, not the “major twentieth-
century long poem…some serious critics claim it to be”; abrupt, contemptuous
dismissal of all that came after.

The early poetry, which Kleinzahler calls Dorn’s best, he also labels “Black
Mountain influenced”, and says Dorn “identified himself throughout his
career with Black Mountain”. What does “identified himself” mean? He
acknowledged his time there? He was, as Kleinzahler quotes him admitting,
“somewhat corrected” there?  He was forever an acolyte? It’s a weasel
phrase; in fact, the finest poems in Dorn’s early work owe little to Black
Mountain. As a favorite instance, “The Land Below” is well over six hundred
lines of discursive observation of his contemporary America as Dorn turned
thirty, as seen from the then oblique perspective of Taos. The skill and
disinterested passion with which Dorn sets that narrative prefigures the
intellectual acuity of Gunslinger. It is instructive to hear the rhythms of
the earlier poem morph into mock epic.

Kleinzahler ignores Twenty-four Love Songs (Frontier, ’69). If he can find
its equal in the past half century, I’d like him to let me know. #6 is
representative of the collection:


		The cleft in our ages
		is an echoing cañon—look
		I insist on my voice
		Archeus become my life
		and as any other extension
		not to be ignored—
		if you were my own time’s possession
		I’d tell you to fuck off
		with such vivid penetration
		you’d never stop gasping
		and pleasure unflawed

		would light our lives, pleasure
		unrung by the secretly expected
		fingers of last sunday

		Do you hear me, can you
		please only agree with me
		because poems and love
		and all that happens in the street

	That the collection was immediately followed by a second, comparable, set
suggested that only Patchen’s love poems were equal in their ability to
accumulate the progress of desire.

Of Gunslinger, Kleinzahler’s faint-praise “glorious mess” belongs in a movie
review. In the inexorability of its organization, Dorn’s poem is much closer
to the Odyssey than “The Rape of the Lock” is to the Iliad. No recent
American has so honored the epic by mocking it, with the dissimilar
exception of Welty’s Losing Battles.

But the post-Gunslinger work is dismissed as “tasteless”, “ugly” and
prosaic. I wonder how Dorn could have fallen so precipitously. And why his
work kept appearing in such handsome editions. What so fooled the editors at
Wingbow, Turtle Island, Cadmus and the others who competed for the
opportunity to publish him? Why has his reputation in England and among
“some serious critics” not suffered? If his late work is “splenetic”, why is
that not an appropriate response to the muzzy, sentimental politics of the
MFA poets who are allowed to think that it is adequate to write like WCW?
If he was pointed (“epigrammatic, satiric, and political”, says
Kleinzahler), what better correction to the passionless and obtuse? If Dorn
is lost in spleen, how does Kleinzahler account for the playful invention
and endless musicality of Captain Jack’s Chaps, Yellow Lola, and
Abhorrences, for instances? Is “Broadcide”, his elegy for Richard Brautigan,
“commonplace”? And what of Recollections of Gran Apachería (Turtle Island,
’74), from which I ask you to consider the following:

	And when, above Janos
	we asked permission of the women
	to strangle the children
	the women consented
	and the suicide gripping
	of the throats of our own children was done
	and those delightful voices lay silenced
	in absolute sacrifice
	in the burrows where we hid
	we slipped out   through the light
	from Captain Garcias raging grass fire
	once more to the Sierra Madre
	once more past the jaws of your hungry god
	the frenzy of survival rushing from our pores

If that defines spleen, maybe we ought to order all our generals—not to
mention our poets—a barrel.

&#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#945; means “to look at” or “examine”, so
when Dorn states, in the preface to Collected Poems (Four Seasons, 1974),
that his work is “theoretical in nature”, it is clear that he is not talking
about speculation nor any other notion separate from the actual. He adds
that his work is “poetic by virtue of its inherent tone”. Any examination of
Dorn’s work cannot help but conclude that its intrinsic voice is congruent
from “A Rick of Green Wood” to “The Garden of the White Rose”, including all
of Gunslinger. If Kleinzahler believes that Dorn’s later work “falls off
precipitously”, he should demonstrate—rather than assert—the way the
inherent tone of the work changes. Instead, like Silliman, Kleinzahler
attacks Dorn’s politics. It has always seemed to me that Dorn’s politics
were based on the refusal to suffer fools at all. He made no exceptions,
including Olson and Creeley, whose follies he critiqued with the same
sardonic levity that so exercises these critics when his contempt is
directed at shibboleths to which Silliman and Kleinzahler currently pay
obeisance, good taste and fawning over victimhood included.

Let me end by quoting Dorn’s final published poem:




	The Garden of the White Rose

	Lord, your mercy is stretched so thin
	to accommodate the need
	of the trembling earth—
	How can I solicit even
	a particle of it
	for the relief of my singularity
	the single White Rose
	across the garden will
	return next year
	identical to your faith—
	the White Rose, whose
	house is light against the
	threatening darkness.

Does this poem deserve any of the modifiers that Kleinzahler uses to
describe Dorn’s late work? Does it sound like something Mel Gibson might
say? These two have seriously misevaluated Dorn’s work. In Kleinzahler’s
case I’m inclined to think it might have been sloppy reading or, at worst, a
swollen appetite. Silliman appalls me by his campaign of personal
defamation. Whatever the guiding principles of their respective reviews, we
can only hope they never encounter Jonathan Swift.

Silliman's Reply -


You can't abridge an argument that doesn't exist. You don't even wait to the
second paragraph to descend to name calling. And you don't address Dorn's
racist and homophobic actions at all. It's one thing to disagree about the
poetry -- I after said that I like the work prior to Slinger quite a bit --
but the sort of flailing you're doing in this essay isn't about poetry at
all.

I don't get this sort of crap from the fans of Billy Collins when I say that
I don't care for his poetry.

What you need to do, if you truly want to defend Dorn, is the following:

1) explain why the flattened, non-nuanced poetry of the later years has
value

2) explain how the actions of Dorn, Clark et al in Rolling Stock aren't
appalling.

If you don't address both, you're basically leaving him hung out to dry,

Ron

serving as a dénouement to Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls, with video
accompaniment by Zbigniew Bzymek. Trish Salah is a Montreal-based writer,
teacher and spoken word artist. She has new work in the current issues of
the journals Drunken Boat, EOAGH, Canadian Theatre Review, and in the

Lost & Found

Show and tell: Torn texts in multiple voices. Fugitive transmissions. Images
and objects lost or abandoned are found and polished. The sound of a slow
train by the green light of half forgotten songs. POEMS ARE FUN, glamour is
made easy. A manual for violence prevention follows ADVANCED TYPING TIPS,
PART 5. Glass negative projections. Offerings from an archive. A slide show
from an abandoned elementary school. What to do when you lose someone. What
to do if you find them. There will be surprises, appearances and absences.
David Gatten, filmmaker, Henry James fan, lover of poems and poets, recent
Guggenheim fellow and aspiring audio book artist, makes bookish films about
letters and libraries and boat and ghosts that are filled with words, some
of which you can read. You can find his films in the permanent collections
of the Whitney Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago but he can rarely
find his glasses. He lives and works by the water in Red Hook, Brooklyn and
Seabrook Island, South Carolina. For tonight's event David has invited some
of his favorite scavengers to present sounds, images and words, either as
they found them or incorporated as elements in compositions of their own
design. Participants include Macgregor Card, Mary Helena Clark, Ellie Ga,
Jenny Perlin, Michael Robinson, Jonathan Schwartz, Phil Solomon and Jessie
Stead. Please go to http://www.poetryproject.com/calendar.php for

Drowned


When Cassandra awakes the sun
is already in the room, so too
the salted riverbank smell,
dampness infecting the sheets.

This wave of blood has flowed
from her body, the white cotton
nightdress dyed red makes her
a target, the mattress beneath
drenched. Called for, Hecuba
takes the stairs in twos, places
her hands on Cassandra's warm
cheeks, raves about the moon.
Now who's crazy, thinks Cassandra
and pulls away, Hecuba sitting
on the drowned bed, both their hands
stained red. (Rhonda Douglas)

Anyone paying attention to any of these things will know that I'm
infamously late with some of these above/ground press subscription
mailings, & that I've barely made anything since last summer; I've been
working to correct that for months (& once I'm in Alberta, not only will
mailing be better & more regular, but the backlog of publications &
previous mailings will be completely caught up; watch too for a secret
(still) above/ground project that starts when I arrive!), including
perpetually-forthcoming chapbooks by Karen Clavelle (Winnipeg), Cath
Morris (Vancouver) & Barry McKinnon (Prince George), as well as a
corrected publication by Phil Hall (Toronto) & Margaret Christakos'
(Toronto) STANZAS (oh, why can't photocopying just be free or something);
for a reading as part of The Factory Reading Series a few days ago [see
Amanda Earl's report on the reading through the link below], there were two
new little publications that came out, including:


RUSHES
by Kate Greenstreet (New Jersey)
$4


&


Time, If It Exists, The Cassandra Poems
by Rhonda Douglas (Ottawa)

"Henceforth our soldiers in Iraq will find MySpace, YouTube and eleven other
websites blocked when they try to write home or post pictures and videos
from military computers. This is the latest in an ongoing crackdown on our
people blogging from Iraq. Never mind that much of what we know about this
war comes not from commercial news outlets but from what servicemen
and -women have sent back home through cyberspace."

"The Pentagon says that the communications ban is needed because private
messages were clogging Internet capacity and getting in the way of priority
war communications. It did not add that some of what our people were sending
back home were pictures of events and actions the Administration does not
want shown. The President long ago refused to permit pictures of our own war
dead returning home in flag-draped coffins, so he must have been going nuts
over what active-duty soldiers have been posting on YouTube."

I will be doing a couple of talks in Paris, participating in the E-Poetry
conference.

***************
FIRST SCREENING
***************

On Tuesday May 22 at 9 am, at University Paris8 - amphi X, I'll talk about
http://vispo.com/bp , which is a collaborative project recently completed
with Geof Huth, Marco Niemi, Dan Waber, and Lionel Kearns: we recovered some
programmed, kinetic poems from 1984 called First Screening by the Canadian
experimental poet bpNichol and present that work, along with writings about
First Screening.

It seems often to be assumed that digital art is necessarily short-lived.
Part of the motivation--at least for me--was to see if we could do an
interesting job of recovering this work done on an Apple IIe in Apple Basic,
and present it in a multi-formed way on the net. And write about it from
various relevant perspectives.

This project is a look back at some of the work of quite a forward-looking
poet. But this project is also something of a how-to concerning how to
recover and present old digital poetry and possibly other types of digital
art.

**********
RECENT ART
**********

On Tuesday May 22 at 20h at Le Point éphémere (200 quai de Valmy, 75010
Paris, station Jaures), I'll be presenting and discussing some work in
progress such as http://vispo.com/bc/qt and
http://vispo.com/nio/pens/screenshots as well as a finished piece:
http://vispo.com/kearns .

I am looking forward to this trip to the city of light. Hope to see you
there.

Wel but it is not the first such video-forum  -  sorry.

Meshworks has been developing a fine archive of video-poems and videos
of readings online for the past two years. So i am really happy to
have more. But the claim to be the first is moot  -  especially as
other work(s) were online way b4 Meshworks even.

We never claiimed first footing and The Continental Review is silly in doing so.

Great to have more company in what is one of the most interesting
developments for poetry over the past decade.

love and looking forwards

If you're in New York next weekend, please come hear us read our poetry, prose, and prose poetry! We graduated from the Literary Arts Program last year, and this is a bit of a reunion reading for us before we scatter even further across the country. Hope you can make it!

Michael Tod Edgerton, Kate Schapira, Bronwen Tate, Caroline Whitbeck, and Lynn Xu

Sunday May 27th 7:30pm
Stain Bar, Williamsburg, Brooklyn
766 Grand St./ L to Grand Ave, walk 1 block West.
http://www.stainbar.com/


 Michael Tod Edgerton won the 2004 Boston Review Poetry Contest and the 2005 Five Fingers Review Poetry Contest. His poems have appeared or are forthcoming in such other journals as Chelsea, Denver      Quarterly, Fell Swoop, New American Writing, New    Orleans Review, Skanky Possum, Wild Strawberries, and Word For/Word. He earned his MFA in Literary Arts from      Brown University, and will be entering the doctoral program in English at the      University of Georgia in the fall.


Kate Schapira   lives in Rhode Island, where she teaches writing and literature and organizes Publicly Complex, a reading series featuring innovative and challenging writing by the not yet famous.   She is the author of Phoenix Memory, a chapbook available from horse less press, and of several handmade self-published chapbooks.  This summer she is looking forward to cleaning her work area, appearing on a panel at the University of Rhode Island's first summer writing conference, and working on her new project, an anti-epic set after all the glaciers have melted.



Bronwen Tate is the author of a poetry chapbook, Souvenirs (self-published, 2006; available through the Dusie Chapbook Kollectiv) and an as yet untitled chapbook to appear from Cannibal Press sometime soon.  Some recent poems have appeared in Typo, How2 Journal, No Tell Motel, and Word For/Word.  She received her MFA in poetry from Brown University in 2006.  Hard as it is for her to believe, by the time this reading happens, Bronwen will have packed all of her belongings into boxes and will be about to leave for California, where she will begin a PhD in Comparative Literature at Stanford in the fall. She blogs at  Bread and Jam For Frances.



 Caroline Noble Whitbeck's  manuscript, Our Classical Heritage: A Homing  Device, was the 2006 winner of Switchback Books' Gatewood Prize as selected by judge Arielle Greenberg. She holds a BA in Classics (Latin) from Harvard College and an MFA from Brown University. Born and raised in New York City, she  currently resides in Philadelphia, where she is working toward a PhD in Comparative Literature and Literary Theory at the University of Pennsylvania. Her short play "Woof" was produced off-Broadway as part of the Young  Playwrights Festival 2000, and her poems have appeared in Horse Less Review, Lumina, Elimae, Cab/Net, and Word For/Word. Our Classical Heritage: A Homing Device is forthcoming in September 2007 from Switchback Books.



Lynn Xu is the author of a poetry chapbook, June (Corollary Press, 2006). She has received her MFA from Brown University, the 2007 SLS Fellowship to  St. Petersburg judged by Fanny Howe, the 2006 Greg Grummer Prize judged by Anne Carson, and the 2004 Eisner Prize judged by Lyn Hejinian.  Her poems have appeared in The Canary, Phoebe, and UDP's 6x6, and are forthcoming in Fence, Swerve, and Eoagh.  Lynn Xu likes water.  Likes gold. These are not competing species so she is very happy.


Please also catch Lynn on Wednesday, May 23rd at 6pm, reading in what she fondly addresses as the "purgatory series" (aka: "post-MFA/pre-1st book" series) at Cornelia Street Cafe:
 The Cornelia Street Cafe

how like a century of breeze
in a colossus' footprint you are
'tis there that i caress you laying dreaming

a may afternoon sunshining plaid
a polaroid so gooey warm and spiraling
my awful hairline receding monk-wise

dear how the denim hedges turn purple
when you twist you poke fun at them
your porcelain thighs thieve my identity

and smoky railroad spikes of atmosphere
pound on blue oblivious to yet we're positive
that all of this is something pixellated sacred

my happy head screws around valentine's
in its playpen making funny faces
when you kiss me hard as always

please know that my fountain pen
is hardcore consider these lines of adoration
to be read backwards forwards

  Ray Pospisil grew up outside New York City and has been writing poetry since his youth. He is a strong advocate of poetry as a verbal, performing (and listening) art, and he appears in various clubs around the city. Ray usually writes in formal meter, sometimes with rhyme, but in a colloquial voice. He rejects the notion that formal poetry must focus on Greek gods and flowers, or that it can only articulate conservative political and social views. Ray's work has been published by several journals, including The Lyric, Iambs & Trochees, The Newport Review and on The Rogue Scholars Collective web site. He works as a freelance journalist, covering energy and environmental issues.

David Baratier had indicated in April that signing the
petition against unfair postal rate increases for
publishers of small magazines had to be done by April
24th.  I had neglected to act in time, but recently
saw that the petition is still up at freepress.net.
Upon enquiry, a member of Free Press informed me:

"The initial date to send in comments was on
April 24. However, due to the overwhelming response
from this campaign, the postal service moved the date
that this would go into effect to July
15."

"Overwhelming response"--this sounds terrific.

So, if you have not yet signed the petition and would
like to, please go to

http://action.freepress.net/campaign/postal

as I have.

By the way, if you, like me, are confused about
whether the request to "edit the (petition's) message"
requires you to add any salutations to your particular
congresspersons, etc., or a closing signature, no,
everything like that is indeed automatically handled
by the information about your name and address you
give in the form to the right of the page.  I was
assured of this by the Free Press member who kindly
answered my questions.

Onward!

Chris, yes Ron's press still exists, and he
still lives in Philadelphia.  Just saw him a
couple of days ago.  His e-mail address
is rush2press@yahoo.com

He has a book of his own that came out
last year titled PHILADELPHIA ON THE FLY:
TALES OF AN URBAN ANGLER

His passion for Philadelphia is one I share,
though in his book it's for riding his bike
along the rivers and fishing.  You ever come
to Philly you should ask Ron to play you a
song on his bango, he's a natural!

            Wow, I think you you mean another Chris---but it's good
to get this info from the old stromping ground.
             I haven't seen Ron for years; he was (and I'm sure still

Hey Chris, yeah man it was Chris Lott who
wrote asking about Rush 2 & Swegman.

HEE HEEEE, I received several e-mails to
correct my spelling of banjo.  Geesh, sorry
I'm not as fucking perfect as the rest of ya!

But I ask, in all seriousness, what would a
bango look like?  Sound like?  Ah, it's
something new to keep me awake at night!

Ron is great, yes.  Poor as a beggar like
the rest of us here, crowded now with all
this hip import of rich kid stock.  Ah, misery
in Philadelphia!  But Love!  And we cook one
another beans when someone's too poor,
which does happen more than we like.

HEY CHRIS STROFFOLINO, before I forget!
There is a big, beautiful Gil Ott Tribute about
to happen.  And one of the things I want to
mention at the microphone was the days when
I first moved to town, and you and Candance
Kaucher and others were already here.  As was
Molly Russakoff.  But those were the days
our downtown, center city was dubbed
The Zulli Nation, after Al Zulli the landlord.
Molly and I were just talking about him.  Our
rent WAS FUCKING CHEAP, and it's because
Zulli truly Loved the arts, and wanted us all to
have affordable rent.  I was paying 210, Molly
was paying 240 (or 250?), but my old place is
now 1500 a month.  That stinking fucking shoe
box I lived in is now 1500 a month!

But Gil Ott was central to that Zulli Nation, and
it was his GENIUS to spread it out.  And he did,
he fucking did.  He started arts centers in deep
North Philly, West Philly, South Philly, and then
created a bus tour of these centers, and showed
off the much hidden talent.  Wonderful, golden
years those were, and Gil Ott insisted on the
Love of community where it didn't even exist.
And who knows how many changed lives were
a result, right?

Yesterday I was mucking around in my little
garden plot downtown looking at all the fucking
condominums (literally dozens of them) coming
up out of the ground, and it made me a little
sad, because these rich bastards moving in
have no clue whatsoever what this city had to
offer not that long ago.  What a rich, glorious
time we had though!

Chris, you were busy bringing Alice Notley and
others down from NY to read.  Gil Ott was bringing
Harryette Mullen and others.  Between the two of
you you both managed to ignite some experiment
in poetry which was mostly absent.  Well, there
was a lot of experiment with the other arts, especially
jazz, especially sculpture, etc., but it was you and
Gil who gave Philadelphia the much needed injection
to the poetry!

Now of course there are so many experimental poets
that there's clearly defined battle zones of the slam
poets, the Sharon Olds poets, and the lump-sum
of the avant garde, which of course is far more
various than anyone can even begin to imagine,
but at one time...

And by the way, I'm not that sad.  I'm actually pretty
fucking happy.  Especially now that we know our
good friend Frank Sherlock is clear of illness, and
marching around town with his cane.  He's thin, but
getting stronger.  And has a big beard now, and a
couple weeks ago someone yelled out to him, calling
him the Gypsy King.  He does look the part now.
Ah man, you need to see the poem he wrote while
he was in the hospital, nearly dead more than once.
It's a beautiful thing that poem!  And you need to
HEAR HIM READ IT!  Yes you do!

It's making it's tour of the states
in a newly restored version!  And
man oh man I've been waiting
for YEARS to see it on the big
screen!  Especially considering
that when it was first released I
was a toddler.  I just wrote about
it coming to Philadelphia on
the PhillySound, with some
links for anyone interested in
checking to see when it's coming
to your city or town:
http://PhillySound.blogspot.com
There are links on the one page
where I think you can figure this
out if you want.  BUT SERIOUSLY,
DON'T MISS IT IF YOU CAN
POSSIBLY HELP IT!

My chapbook, Children Having Trouble with Meat, is now available!

http://www.lulu.com/content/846234

From the introduction by Jack Anders: Christine Hammâ€™s chapbook,
â€œChildren Having Trouble with Meatâ€ shows an admirable ability to balance
metaphorical intensity while keeping focus on a clearly stated theme. The poems display a
sensibility to food, and eating, and the existential implications of both, in a way which
is both a contemporary commentary on eating disorders, and a delicate allusion to myths
of eating and being.

Christine Hamm is getting her PhD in English and was a runner-up for the Queens Poet
Laureate.  This work, her third chapbook, was chosen by Jenni Russell out of a hundred
entries to MiPoesias.  In 2006, Mayapple Press published Christine's full-length poetry
book, The Transparent Dinner.  Christine likes a well-done flank steak every once and a
while.

Sample from the book:

Qualities of Sugar

it is white and sometimes it is brown

on the kitchen floor it attracts ants

sometimes in the bag during the summer
if it's kept low down on the bottom shelf
you will encounter little black maggots,
already dead, when you open the flap

when you try to wipe it off on your shorts
it clings to your hands and folds into rolls of dirty
white grit in the creases of your palms

it doesn't feel very good if you just put
a tablespoon on your tongue
it can choke you, going down
and then you need some pepsi

your dentist gives you lollipops, which have sugar

when you try to lift the whole bag
by yourself and it rips and spills
into a tiny beach just for dolls
then your mother will be disappointed
it can make her sigh

you often add it on top of bread or cheese
to see if they will taste better

when it is frozen in the form of a green popsicle
you and your brother will hit each other
in the face to get it first

when you mix it with water in a clear glass
it moves about a bit
and disappears

sometimes at night it's all that's left and it's enough
to keep you busy a short while until you realize
the house is empty
and you begin to howl


And the first ten people who buy a book (and email me with your address, at
inktastesbitter@yahoo.com) get this on 8.5" x 4.5" card stock:

Songs and Spoken Word in North Hollywood, California USA

For everyone lucky enough to be living in the Los Angeles area . . .

I'll be performing a rare live set of songs at Zombie Joe's
Underground THIS THURSDAY (that's May 24th) at 8:30 p.m., opening for
the spoken word stylings and guitar prowess of Zombie Joe and Neil
Silverman.

Here's what critics all over are saying:

"If you must see one show this year where a guy named Chris Reiner
sings and plays his own songs for about 25 minutes, it should be this
one." -- Chris Reiner, Critic

And if you can't make it THIS THURSDAY, we'll be doing it again on
May 31st and June 7th.

RESERVATION HOTLINE: 818-202-4120

@ ZOMBIE JOE'S UNDERGROUND THEATRE
4850 LANKERSHIM BLVD., NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA

(just north of the 134 / 101 freeways, across from KFC, and for the
Metro, take the Red Line to the end of the line in NoHo and walk or
pedal about 7 blocks south on Lankershim)

Gerald Jones


Gerald Jones, brave photographer, raconteur, lighting and cinematography
expert, underground legend for those who knew him, died April 28th this
year, after a long and harsh, protracted, bout with cancer and the medical
establishment (no one should have to die like that). He was true to his
work which was his life. He spoke on a panel on sex, theory and practice,
I held at Nexus in Atlanta and put everyone to shame. He had 384 pennies
on the floor of his Miami apartment; his sister found them everywhere
after he passed away. He sometimes inherited my equipment. He was generous
beyond belief and after chemo, when he visited NY, brought us a book of
photographs and text on the manatees. He went slough-slogging with us in
the Everglades. He smoked more than anyone I knew and gave it up years ago
and suddenly but possibly too late. He stayed with me on and off for up to
two weeks. He was seen walking the early morning Atlanta streets and I
imagine Miami and New York. He was a supporter during the hell I went
through at Florida International University. He photographed politics and
murder in Haiti. He photographed the clan. He was in a biennale I curated
and put the work up during the opening. He carried cameras. Early on he
spoke with a heavy cough but that went away. There was a wake in Miami.
Gerald was 62 and would have worked for centuries. There's no heaven but
god bless you Gerald, you've already made your way

Three of them


1. I Once Met by Kent Johnson

review I Once Met by  John Latta  here:
http://isola-di-rifiuti.blogspot.com/2007/05/kent-johnsons-i-once-met.html

succinct review of a great book - like the reviewer, a book I also read from
cover to cover in one read, even though i wanted to slow down and have some
for later, a small book ABOUT poets -  so packed it feels like novellas, AND
they make you laugh.

this latest is an evolution of the longhouse series of fold-outs, they've
outdone themselves here and taken it a step further. A book that's a
pleasure to hold in the hands.

http://www.longhousepoetry.com/longhouse2007.html


2. the Spring 2007 portfolio from Blue Press - a beautifully produced set of
19 broadsides, booklets, fold-outs and other forms of magic.  Including work
by Bill Berkson, Lewis MacAdams, Joanne Kyger, Donald Guravich,  Patrick
Dunagan, Noel Black, Will Yackulic, Micah Ballard, Michael Price, and a
Michaux translation by Cedar Sigo.

http://bluepressbooks.com/

Blue Press have been making books and poetry since 1990 and now prove to
keep getting better. If this is an  indication of what opstedal has up his
sleeve theres much more to come.



3. Gas #3 - Ted Berrigan Issue - Summer 1991

The best $25 I spent in 2007 (so far): I also ordered Gas #3 from Blue Press
- the Ted Berrigan issue from 1991. If you like Berrigan, this is the
unofficial companion to the Collected works that came out from UC Press last
year, but with Berrigan at the helm and collaborating with co-authors. This
is just a lot of fun, a sketch by berrigan of himself on the cover, and
pieces he wrote with Clark, Padgett, Gallup, Notley, Hollo, Schneeman,
Waldman, Carroll, Myles, etc. Not sure how may copies of this there are
left. Pages not numbered but feels like more than a hundred pages worth.

"One of the pleasures of poetry is inhabiting that world-creating space. I=B9=
m
not saying there is no real world (but when is the last time you heard
anything real?) or that the world is simply a product of our language
(please pass the margarine) but rather that the world is colored by our
words, shaped by our grammar, valued by our metaphors. But poetry is not an
illustration of philosophy and while such ideas as these are relevant (who
are you calling an idea?), what=B9s necessary about poems is the way they mak=
e
their own logic, quite different than the logic of philosophical ideas abou=
t
imitation or representation."

I have a poem in "My Way: Speeches and Poems" that touches on this:
DON=B9T BE SO SURE
(DON=B9T BE SAUSSURE)

My cup is my cap
& my cap is my cup
When the coffee is hot
It ruins my hat
We clap and we slap
Have sup with our pap
But won=B9t someone please
Get me a drink

from a 1999 interview with Bradford Senning.

Friend told me that the original MS of Kerouac's
On the Road is on display at a museum in downtown
Santa Fe until the end of May. Might be worth a
look if you're in the right part of downtown Santa Fe.

Collected Volume of Essays on Poetry and Cultural Studies
Edited by Mike Chasar and Heidi R. Bean

We are seeking contributions for a volume of collected essays =20
exploring the relationship between poetry and cultural studies.  This =20
project builds on our recent special issue of The Iowa Journal of =20
Cultural Studies (Spring/Fall 2006; see www.uiowa.edu/~ijcs) and =20
focuses not on The Poem but rather on the range and multiplicity of =20
=1B$B!H=1B(Bpoetries=1B$B!I=1B(B made newly visible by recent developments i=
n cultural =20
studies (including cultural studies-related approaches from the =20
perspectives of performance studies, everyday life studies, book =20
studies, and/or media studies).

Contributors are encouraged to think broadly about poetries as =20
cultural phenomena, the acts poetic utterances perform, and the =20
intentional and unintentional meanings they acquire in specific =20
contexts and communities as they get produced, distributed, used and =20
consumed.  Emphasizing a pluralized notion of =1B$B!H=1B(Bpoetries,=1B$B!I=
=1B(B the volume =20
will be divided into three sections: =1B$B!H=1B(BPersons=1B$B!I=1B(B registe=

We are planning five essays per section and currently have about a =20
third of the volume committed, including essays by Maria Damon and =20
Cary Nelson.  We invite potential contributors to especially consider =20
how vectors of race, nationality, sexuality, technology and geography =20
inflect how poetries mean and how they manifest themselves.

Email inquiries and submissions (preferably attached in MS Word) to =20
heidi-bean@uiowa.edu or michael-chasar@uiowa.edu by September 1, 2007. =20
  Submissions should be accompanied by a brief abstract and author bio.

I've read this a couple of times now, and didn't respond right away because
I wanted to be certain of how I felt about it.

This is now a public argument, since you made it public.  (Just in case
someone tells me to mind my own business).

Ron Silliman often pisses me off.  Not always, but some weeks more than
once.  So I can relate to you wanting to take shots at him.  I'm just not
sure that I agree with the shots you're taking.

It feels to me like you're accusing him of the very thing you would wish him
to be.  In other words you're accusing him of being cold, of not judging the
work of Dorn but the man Dorn.  Yet you would also wish for him to be cold
enough in order to not have his feelings involved at all, and to only see
the work.

That aside I do believe that Silliman has made clear what of Dorn's work he
likes, and what he doesn't like.

He has also been very vocal about the man Dorn.  And why not?  Ed Dorn said
some pretty miserable things, should he be forgiven, should he be Loved
unconditionally?

It doesn't really matter what Ron Silliman thinks about Ed Dorn the man
because Silliman likes the work.  He literally said to a group of us last
year after a reading in Philadelphia, "Dorn is like finding out
your favorite rock star is a nazi."

I'm not making that up.  He said that.

One of the things I value most about Silliman is that he is unafraid of
expressing his feelings.  While so many want to accuse him of being cold and
mean, what they miss completely is that he's SHARING SOMETHING!  There are
plenty of poets from his generation who share nothing when it comes to
feeling.  I have seen them myself.  Cold, almost mechanical in nature.  My
god, in an age of bourgeois poetry where conflict of truth is sublimated
with under-the-breath comments and the impotence of the passive-aggressive,
it's poets like Silliman we need frankly!

It's really important to get pissed off.  And you were pissed off at
Silliman, that's fair, that's fine.  But really, seriously, should Silliman,
or anyone else for that matter, EVER judge a poet by the publisher
publishing them?  Because that is part of your argument against Silliman
here, saying that he's NOT WAKING UP TO THE EVIDENCE AROUND HIM WITH THESE
PUBLISHERS FIGHTING OVER ONE ANOTHER TO PUBLISH DORN!

Please!  Knopf publishes Louise Gluck, and I still think she's a slow death
to read.  I'd rather piss razor blades than be made to read an entire Louise
Gluck book!  I don't care if Elvis came back from the dead and said she was
the One and Only poet to read!  Yet people seem to Love her!  Some people
never shut up about her!  I'm convinced there are life-sized posters of
her above beds all over America, but I still can't stand her poems!

And it's very important to talk about the things Dorn said outside his
poems.  And also important of course that we examine those things in the
context in which they were said.

Should we judge his poems by this though?  Well, I don't think so, not at
all.

When visiting Jonathan Williams once I asked him about going to see Ezra
Pound at St. Elizabeth's.  I asked him (to be more exact about my question
to him) what it was like being a queer man, going to see Pound, someone who
had openly supported fascism in Europe at a time when queers were being
branded and murdered.  He thought about it for a second and then simply
said, "The terrible things he did and said were not the poems."

And there are plenty of people who refuse to read Pound because of his
politics.  And I like to debate this issue with those people, even though
they almost always remain solid in not needing to read Pound.

CAConrad
p.s. One of my all-time favorite issues of the CHICAGO REVIEW is the Dorn
issue, most especially the essay, "Edward Dorn Out: Forms of Dispossession"
by Dale Smith.  In it Smith writes, "Dorn made himself available to an
experience of the West. In the process he perceived a difference between who
he was and who he thought himself to be. But what any of us are capable of
is more important, and that we make ourselves so."

Thank you for this, and for the opportunity to 'compare mythologies'
in terms of our senses of philly late 80s.
(I ain't gonna apologize in shame ways my cohen reference)...
I love your sense of Zulli Nation....
I had actually never heard that phrase before.
I don't even know if people called my West Philly 88-89 primary scene
window Tiberino Nation.
But The Tiberinos
(In my myth, Joe was larger than life figure with Bachannal on South
Street,
and Ellen for her famous Move Confrontation mural which I was proud
to say my courtyard looked out on)
had a similar presence and VISION to the what you describe as Zulli,
so I might as well say Tiberino Nation...
but when we started Killtime Place in 1989, probably more of the
younger folks
associated it with that, as the Tiberinos were kinda passing the
torch to us...
Big Mess Theatre, the squats, the hippy-vs-punk thing, sharing a
space with Cheryl Dunye
(I miss Cheryl Dunye....I know she's all famous and everything...but
I gotta find her again)...

Anyway no slight to Gil (we had our differences, largely over
'language poetry,'
but we made up later, and not just because he changed his mind), but
for me in terms of poetry in philly,
it was much more LAMONT STEPTOE, the late JEROME ROBINSON in terms of
the older folks
who, let's say, 'kept me honest'. Oh there's so much more to say
about those times
(i've written, with larger brushstrokes, about it in my unpublished
memoir-like thing,
but it's good to have my memory jugged here--

and sorry Poetics List if this seems like I should be BACKCHANNELING CA
in some marginalized history of the poor,
the poor who may change the meaning of the word poor
before we die...
and changing the connotation can be social work in that it manifests
itself non-verbally as well

Anyway, CA, we could (maybe should) do a book of it,
or at least a film or talking book,
coz I smoke less cigarettes when I talk than I do when I write...
especially in, or from, the 'mines' of memory...

Her Noise: Women in Experimental Music (2007): A video documenting the development of the
Her Noise project between 2001 and 2005 and features interviews with artists including
Diamanda Galas, Lydia Lunch, Kim Gordon, Jutta Koether, Peaches, Marina Rosenfeld, Kembra
Pfhaler, Chicks On Speed, Else Marie Pade, Kaffe Matthews, Emma Hedditch, Christina
Kubisch and the show's curators, Lina Dzuverovic and Anne Hilde Neset. The documentary

celebrates the occasion of Electra, the London-based arts agency, new partnership with
UbuWeb.

/ubu Editions, Third Series (Spring 2007): Edited by Danny Snelson UbuWeb is pleased to
present the latest installment of our ongoing series of full-length e-books. Titles for
this series include works by Steve Benson, Maurice Blanchot, Mairéad Byrne, Terence Gower
& Mónica de la Torre, Dick Higgins, Bernard Nöel, Severo Sarduy, Claude Simon, Rosemarie
Waldrop, Robert Wilson, and Monique Wittig. This new series of /ubu editions presents
eleven out-of-print works from 1957 to 1994 - and also includes three newer titles
(1999-2007). Of the historical republications, there are three works of poetry, three
works of prose, one opera libretto, one work of critical theory, and one manifesto -
though each piece blurs these genres. Seven were written in English, four appear in
translation, and one is bilingual. Two authors could be considered language poets, two
are associated with Tel Quel, one arguably initiated Fluxus, another arguably initiated
the new novel. Four are women, nine are men. One title was changed for its /ubu
publication.

Peter Rose: Vox 13 - Eleven films created between 1983 and 2000, Vox 13 offers a grand
circumnavigation of the subject of language. These films consider what it means to read,
what it means to listen, when it is that we speak, how words acquire meaning, what it
means to write, who we listen to, how we listen, what speaks, other ways we can speak,
what the voice is, where language can be found, what words do to time, what holds stories
together, and how light shapes language.

Francis Bacon - The South Bank Show (1985): Part of The South Bank Show series, David
Hinton directs this BBC documentary about British painter Francis Bacon, known for his
horrifying portraits of humanity. The program consists of a series of conversations
between Bacon and interviewer Melvyn Bragg, starting with commentary during a side-show
presentation at the Tate Gallery in London. Later in the evening, Bacon is followed
through various bars hanging out, drinking, and gambling. In another segment, Bacon
provides a tour of his painting studio and a glimpse at his reference photographs of
distorted humans. The artist discusses his theories, influences, and obsessions. This
title won an International Emmy Award in 1985.
http://www.ubu.com/film/bacon.html

David Schafer: Audio Works (1999-2007): A survey of Schafer's oeuvre, from his radically
altered plunderphonic pieces -- including densely layered remixes of easy listening, pop,
soft and classic rock records -- to his geeky "General Theory Expo", a continuous play of
a reading by a female voice actor of a Jacques Derrida lecture from 1966. Schafer
conceptually explores ideas about how the structures of space and sound data, controls,
oppresses, stimulates, or enlivens the listening subject. On these tracks, Schafer works
with voice actors and with various degrees of superimposition that border on, or fully
engage, the noise side of things.

The Films of Irene Moon and the Begonia Society: Irene Moon has been creating music, film
and musical lectures since the mid-90s. Her films are head- ing combinations of
completely factual information with neo-Dada homemade New Wave music, insect sound
samples, microphotography, animations and so much more. Included here are her Films of
the Auk Theater, a touring theater that performs absurd, classical and heavily stylized
theater in rock clubs and music venues. All of the short Auk plays are from 2004-2005.
Also: The Super 8 series: Early films from Moon with soundtracks created from field
recordings of insects and equipment commonly found in a laboratory environment.

Beckett Directs Beckett (1985): In 1985 Samuel Beckett directed "Waiting for Godot",
"Krapp's Last Tape" and "Endgame" as stage pieces with the San Quentin Players. All three
productions were grouped together under the overall title "Beckett Directs Beckett." As
such they toured throughout Europe and in some parts of Asia to wide acclaim. The
programs were aired by PBS in the US and have been seen in many other countries
throughout the world.

Jonas Mekas - Scenes from Allen's Last Three Days on Earth as a Spirit (1997): To mark
the tenth anniversary of Allen Ginsberg's death (April 5, 1997), UbuWeb is featuring this
remarkable video diary of Ginsberg in the days immediately before and after his death.
Streaming and downloadable versions available.

Kirchen, LE DEPEUPLEUR par Serge Martin, L'expulse (Roger Blin), Actes sans paroles,

(English version, David Warrilow), Solo (French version, David Warrilow). Also see Samuel
Beckett in UbuWeb Film.
http://www.ubu.com/sound/beckett.html

Igor and Gleb Aleinikov - Five Films (1984-87): The brothers Igor and Gleb Aleinikov
belonged to the first generation of independent filmmakers in the Soviet Union, who no
longer worked within the studio system, but founded the 'Parallel Cinema'. Their films,
like Western experimental film in the 60s, deliberately refused to conform to
professional standards, and were thus rejected not only officially, but also by many
filmmakers.
http://www.ubu.com/film/aleinikov.html

John Cage - For the Third Time (1978): John Cage speaks with a laryngitis-ridden Richard
Kostelanetz about the techniques he used in "Writing Through Finnegans Wake" (1977) and
"Writing for the Second Time Through Finnegans Wake" (1977). Kostelanetz whispers the
entire interview, as Cage describes his work in full volume. Several other Cage videos
can be viewed here and numerous Cage MP3s & audio files are available on Cage's page in
Ubuweb Sound. See Cage's score for his Songbooks (1970). Listen to his Norton Lectures
(1988-89).
http://www.ubu.com/film/cage.html

Peter Forgacs - Wittgenstein's Tractatus (1992): Forgacs' Wittgenstein Tractatus is
composed of seven short video essays that refer to one of Wittgenstein's most influential
works, Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, first published in 1921. Each of Forgacs' brief
essays — set in motion as a torn photograph comes together, only to break apart again —
relates to one of Wittgenstein's philosophical propositions. Black and white home movies
from the early twentieth century are accompanied by voice-overs and written texts from
Tracatus, in Hungarian and English, and a somber, lyrical score. Scenes of bourgeois life
are haunted by forebodings of the future. Drawing upon the disjunction between language
and image, Forgacs creates a symbolic illustréation of Wittgenstein's theories of logic,
language, reality and representation. You can download the wonderful Tibor Szemzo
soundtrack.
http://www.ubu.com/film/forgacs.html

People Like Us & Ergo Phizmiz - Boots! (2006) (MP3): These recordings document a
collaborative research and development process between People Like Us & Ergo Phizmiz
culminating in a live performance using vintage turntables and vinyl dubplates, a CDr
album ("Boots!"), a 10" vinyl record ("Honeysuckle Boulevard"), and a CD album
("Perpetuum Mobile"). Using the internet and file sharing as our primary means of
communication and collaboration, we experimented and explored our collaborative practices
over a period of almost a year. The files available here constitute the research
sketches, the CDr, and the live performance. We would encourage others to use the
dubplate files to create new juxtapositions and recontextualisations.

Avant-Garde All the Time: The UbuWeb Poetry Foundation Podcast (2007) (MP3) A short (11
minute) interview with UbuWeb founding editor Kenneth Goldsmith introducing the site to a
general listenership, with a specific focus on UbuWeb's sound archives. Full MP3
recordings of the excerpts featured on the podcast include: bpNichol 060173; Marie Osmond
performing Hugo Ball's Karawane; Guiallme Apollinaire Le Pont Mirabeau; Gertrude Stein
The Making of Americans: Parts 1 & 2; The Dial-A-Poem Poets; Patti Smith Parade; Ogden
Nash Word About Winter; Charles Bernstein 1-100. The podcast was produced by Curtis Fox
for The Poetry Foundation.

Peter Whitehead - Wholly Communion (1965): The film "Wholly Communion" captures the
historic event at the Royal Albert Hall on 11 June 1965 where an audience of 7,000
witnessed the first meeting of American and English Beat poets. Among the performers
featured are Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso and Ernst Jandl. The
event was viewed as the inaugural moment of the mass counter culture of the '60s. Despite
being organized in a matter of days, a press conference announcing the event the previous
week guaranteed an estimated audience of 7,000 inside the venue, who had been invited to:
"Come in fancy dress"; "Come with flowers," and "Come!" Many more were turned away at the
door, and, according to the press coverage the next day in The Guardian, those unable to
enter were "clamouring to get in", with the event being described by many as the "biggest
poetry-reading meeting in the English-speaking world"
http://www.ubu.com/film/whitehead.html

Rick Moody - Audio Works (1999-present) (MP3): These pieces represent a small sampling of
Moody's audio work that he's done over the years, mostly for radio. Collaborators include
Kurt Hoffman, Sherre Delys, Chris Abrahams, Hannah Marcus, Tianna Kennedy, Sharanu
Pardeet, Anna M. Saxon, Amy Dissanayake, David Rakowski and John Lurie. Rick Moody is an
American novelist and short story writer best known for The Ice Storm (1994). His most
recent book is The Diviners (2005).
http://www.ubu.com/sound/moody.html

Music Overheard (MP3): An audio response to the exhibition Super Vision at The Institute
of Contemporary Art/Boston, December 10 2006 to April 29 2007. Editor Damon Krukowski
says, "In constructing an audio response (you could call it a soundtrack) to Super
Vision, I followed this lead. Rather than look to the latest computer-based
electronica-the futuristic sounds of tomorrow-I wanted to gather work made by traditional
means, which would not have been possible outside today's digital audio environment. Thus
CD 1 (curated by Bhob Rainey) poses the question: What happens to the sound of acoustic
instruments, once musicians are familiar with the tools and techniques of electronic
music? And CD 2 (curated by Kenneth Goldsmith) asks a related question about our
ur-instrument, the body: How do we hear the body's sounds, now that technology has given
us superhuman ears?" MP3s include Greg Kelley, Sean Meehan, Charles Curtis, Bhob Rainey,
Taku Unami, Chris Corsano, Liz Tonne, Ellen Fullman, Gregory Whitehead, Language Removal
Services, Henri Chopin, Matmos, John Duncan, Caroline Bergvall, Paul Dutton, Lauren
Lesko, Christof Migone, Miya Masakoa, Jim Roche, People Like Us and Leif Elggren & Thomas
Liljenberg. Presented in collaboration with The Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston and
PennSound.

4 American Composers: Directed by Peter Greenaway. Feautring John Cage, Meredith Monk,
Robert Ashley and Philip Glass. Based on London performances under the aegis of the New
York/Almeida Festival, this set of four one-hour documentaries, originally produced in
1983, introduced these avant-garde composers and their music to a general public. It is a
tribute to the filmmakers' accomplishment (and a sorry comment on how we honor our own
prophets) that the set provides no less valuable an introduction for audiences over two
and a half decades later. Rarely seen and out of print, Greenaway's films make a perfect
companion to Robert Ashley's set of composer portraits Music With Roots in the Aether,
produced in the mid-70s.

Hi, everyone,

I'm announcing the first in a series of series=20
at the Towson Arts Collective (TAC) in downtown=20
Towson. This June (through August) we will be=20
hosting (every Thursday night) a different film
with an introduction by diverse film genre scholars.

The theme for this summer is "Sci-Fi circa McCarthyism"

You get the idea - Reds and Aliens have O too much in common!
Watch propagandists distort American history to a thingy pulp!
Watch our Alien comrades fight the brave, unexperienced american actors!
Watch women feign at the site of these horrible oppressors.

Yes, even this introduction is so bad (I cannot lie).=20

the Schedule at the moment is tentative, but if you're in the Baltimore are=
a or have friends in the Baltimore area, pass this note along.

More to come in a few short days...

Thanks,

Friend told me that the original MS of Kerouac's
On the Road is on display at a museum in downtown
Santa Fe until the end of May. Might be worth a
look if you're in the right part of downtown Santa Fe.

Beatific Soul: Jack Kerouac on the Road

November 9, 2007 through March 16, 2008

D. Samuel and Jeane H. Gottesman Exhibition Hall (First Floor)
(NYPL main Branch, E.42nd St. & 5th Ave.)

This exhibition will explore the life and career of the Beat writer and poe=
t
Jack Kerouac, including the evolution of On the Road and other works; his
unique amalgam of Christian and Buddhist spirituality; and his attitude to
the movement that he felt had forsaken its beatific roots and purpose. The
exhibition will draw on the contents of the Jack Kerouac Archive, housed in
the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American
Literature, and will display many of Kerouac=B9s unpublished manuscripts,
drafts and notes for published works, diaries, journals, correspondence,
drawings and paintings; his minutely detailed fantasy baseball and fantasy
horse racing materials; and unpublished photographs of him and his family.
Punctuating the exhibition at various points will be the objects that
Kerouac treasured throughout his life, including the crutches he used after
suffering a football injury while playing for Columbia University, his
harmonicas, Buddhist bells, and his railroad track lantern.

At the heart
of the exhibition lies On the Road itself, fifty years after its initial
publication. The exhibition showcases its three extant typescript drafts,
including the famous scroll, on loan from James Irsay, and many of its
manuscript proto-versions. Scores of the thousand or so substantive
emendations that Kerouac made in the novel=B9s various drafts will be on view=
,
showing how the published text differs dramatically from the scroll=B9s, but
also demonstrating that Kerouac=B9s advocacy of =B3spontaneous prose=B2 and the
principle of =B3first thought, best thought=B2 was qualified not only by the
demands of his editor, but, often, by his own critical eye, at least at thi=
s
point in his writing career.

Also to be displayed are a few selections
from the Berg Collection's newly acquired William S. Burroughs Archive, as
well as manuscripts, rare publications, and drawings by and photographs of
Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and othe=
r
Beat notables, which will document the richness of the Beat movement.

I like this post, Conrad. Straight from both brain & heart!

Don't confuse the poem with the poet
or you will lose them both.

I wrote that recently in a new mss.:
 After Language / Letters to Jack Spicer.

My lines are actually a take off from Lew Welch's dictum:

Don't confuse your mistress with your muse
Or you will lose them both.

(I am not looking at the Welch poem, so I might not be totally accurate
here!)

Spicer, like Dorn, was full of nastiness' of various political, racial,
gender sorts. Without making any excuses for being occasional, and seriously
bad actors - in life, as well as in poems - I suspect most of us can
minimally claim a less publicly acknowledged, poisonous share.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hi, everyone. I am coordinating a poetry contest in
Los Angeles this summer, and I'd like to invite you
all to participate. The theme? It's all about The
Invisible Man (2000), the one-time 2nd-most-popular
show on the SciFi Channel. I'm including all the
information below. Deadline for entries is July 9.
Thanks!

1. Submissions must be original works related in some
way to The Invisible Man (2000); this may be in theme,
use of characters, etc. However, no flaming of
real-life persons or companies associated with the
show, its production, or its airing will be allowed.

2. Submissions may be any style of verse, including
songs. Submissions must be no longer than 350 words.

3. Entrants must be members of the I-Maniacs, a.k.a.
The Invisible Man Fan Club. Go to http://imaniacs.org
to join for FREE.

4. Submissions should be sent to
I_Man_Poetry@yahoo.com as e-mail attachments in
Microsoft Word document format (.doc extension), 1
entry per document. "I-Man Poetry Contest" should be
in the subject line, or the e-mail may be mistaken as
spam and discarded.

5. Entrants may submit as many original works as they
like.

6. Entrants should be sure to include a cover sheet
for each entry, with the title of their entry, and
their name or handle as they would like it to appear
on any awards certificate, list of winners, or
publication.  Judging will be anonymous, so please
don’t put your name or handle on your entry.

7. All persons submitting work agree to allow, without
monetary remuneration, their submissions to be
printed, published online, or otherwise distributed by
the contest coordinators, including officers of the
I-Maniacs, a.k.a. The Invisible Man Fan Club, and
members of the club who actually work on the I-Man
Poetry Contest before, during, and/or after I-ManiCon
2007, in perpetuity. All persons submitting work
retain the right to print, publish, or otherwise
distribute their submissions in any form they may
choose.

8. Submissions are due no later than 11:59 p.m. on
July 9, 2007 to allow time for printing. Submissions
received after this date will be excluded. Submissions
will be judged at I-ManiCon 2007 in Los Angeles on
July 21. Entrants need not be present to win.

9. Submissions must be rated G, PG, or PG-13; anything
excessively vulgar or explicit will not be considered
for the contest or for publication. Mild profanity may
be allowed if it fits within the context of the poem,
to be determined by the contest coordinator. The GD, F
and S words are forbidden; all others will be
considered on a case-by-case situation. The safest way
to avoid this problem is to avoid this kind of
language. "Crap" is not profanity.

10. These rules subject to updating or clarification,
so please check back from time to time to make sure
there have been no changes; entrants will be notified
via e-mail if any important changes occur after they
submit, but it should not affect their entries.

The I-Maniacs Fan Club is not affiliated with, nor
does it hold copyright to, The Invisible Man (2000).

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We generally do not accept postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. However, the Poetics List editor may occasionally
solicit or approve poems for posting on the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

Subject:      Notes on the topology of depression
MIME-Version: 1.0

Notes on the topology of depression


a Trigger events - these are often catalysts of memories/trauma or remin-
ders of aporia. Once triggered, depression is out of control. Avoidance
(circumvention) is sometimes possible through 'bypass' - constructing
other pathways, deflecting the events, redirecting attention.

b Cascade - once a trigger event occurs, a constellation of symptoms and
aporia appears. These are interlocked; a cascade, often overwhelming and
mute, occurs. The result is a sense of inescapable mourning which often
appears without origin. Think of chain reactions, holarchic and scatter-
ing, Waddington's chreod as potential model. Everything feeds into every-
thing, sourceless, targetless, vector as line segment out of nowhere. One
feels an almost literal 'rise' of chemical imbalance, the body drenched in
potential tears, chemistry gone awry. There's a 'mountaineer's equation'
based on the constants in play when a topology is sliced (H.B. Griffiths,
Surfaces) - it's as if the body is subject to planar slicing, as limbs,
thorax, mind are transformed. It's the same old topology, the same proc-
esses at work, time and time again, remaining forever on or beneath the
surface. (In depression, all surfaces are one.) (Depression seeks its own
level.)

c Syzygy - the cascade is a multiply-connected manifold or tension,
torsion; any movement (physical or psychological) threatens to tear the
psyche apart. The syzygy is vectored, barbed, often resulting in the
obsessive construction of subjunctive ('if only I had') narratives. The
past is active, crippling; the present neutral, the future passive. It's
as if the psyche skitters across nodes; the best one can hope for is
endurance.

d Horizon - horizon disappears; the manifold of lived experiences is
expelled. What remains is debris - part-objects, broken memories, the
equally broken syntax of existence. Nothing coheres.

e Decathection - the states and processes of the world are disinvested,
without boundary or 'lip' - things fall away without falling or failure.
The result is a world of loss, but what is lost has already and perman-
ently disappeared.

f Defuge - with decathection comes exhaustion, enervation; one sinks into
an abjection without transgression. Pleasure is inconceivable, words lose
their performativity, disgust and sorrow come and go in the midst of a
blunt neutrality replete with death, decay, nothing at all. The result is
defuge, a state of abject hopelessness.

e Emptied - the world is emptied without emptying. What separates this
from meditation is the accompaniment of sorrow, mourning over ghosts, an
endless and horizon-less suffering. This is a useless state, a state of
uselessness.

f Comfort - beneath the surface, there is a comfort zone constructed from
the remnants of defense and memory; one nests in depression, which makes
it so difficult to remedy. The nesting is the sinking-towards-death; the
potential final - and only - remaining process is suicide. Everything else
has disappeared. But comfort alleviates suicide, and one may stay in this
state, always faltering, indefinitely.

g Cure - cure breaks through the topology from the outside; it may also
redefine the epistemology of the topology as evanescent, not of this or
any other world. The former might be a talking cure, and the latter,
medication. But all too often both become a continuous mode of existence,
itself impenetrable, itself calling out (from the outside, from the
outset) for a cure. One is lost in the maze, often sinking beneath the
surface to localized symptoms or the return of the depression in full
force.

h Death - cure is no cure, of which death puts an end to it. Electroshock
and other imposed traumas may permanently change the course of depression,
but these occur to someone else.

i Someone else - Someone else is always outside, perhaps capable of a
fundamental recuperation of the self with greatly reduced depression. Even
without imposed traumas or cures, there is often the glimmer of another
way, an elsewhere, which appears from time to time. The other way, how-
ever, appears far out of reach; it is someone else's way and, within
depression, has no bearing on one's state. Depressive time is always dusk,
no matter how dark the initial conditions, and in this manner it relates
to sleep as well.

Just out from the MLA --
Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures  (3rd Edition)

more info at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog

from my essay on "Poetics":

The profession is best that professionalizes least.

The sociologist C. Wright Mills got this just right when he wrote,
"The aim of the college, for the individual student, is to eliminate
the need in his life for the college; the task is to help him become
a self-educating man. For only that will set him free."

--

Art students used to be told that the fundamental requirement for
drawing or painting was to accurately render figures. But this
confused one modality of representation with the entire process of
visual aesthesis. It might have been better to say: you can't draw if
you can't see. Correlatively, we might say, you can't write if you
can't think. Scholarship requires poetics.

Paratactic writing, thinking by association, is no less cogent or
persuasive than hypotactic exposition, with its demands that one
thought be subordinated to the next. Poetics reminds us that the
alternate logics of poetry are not suited just for emotion or
irrational expression; poetics lies at the foundation of all writing.

Poetry is a name we use to discount what we fear to acknowledge.

The accurate documentation of information used in a work is a vital
principle of scholarship. Similarly, scholarship requires a writer to
consider challenges to her or his views: but this too often is
assumed to mean considering challenges to the content of what is
being said while ignoring challenges to the style and form. The
importance of poetics for scholarship is not to decree that anything
goes but rather to insist that exposition is an insufficient
guarantor of reason. Poetics makes scholarly writing harder, not
easier: it complicates scholarship with an insistence that the way we
write is never neutral, never self-evident.

Clarity in writing is a rhetorical effect not a natural fact. One
man's eloquence can be another's poison; one woman's stuttering may
be the closest approximation of truth that we will ever know.

A question for poetry magazine editors out there:=20
=20
Does your publication accept for publication poems previously posted to per=
sonal blogs or to online workshops? If so, why, and if not, why not? Do you=
r submissions guidelines clearly spell out your position in this regard?
=20
As a blogging poet who finds posting poems on my personal blog a useful par=
t of the writing process, I am trying to work out whether this practice wil=
l be more harmful than helpful in the long run. I have interesting posts (f=
rom opposing points of view) by the editors of 'Segue' magazine and 'No Tel=
l Motel' on my blog at the moment, and would love to feature additional dis=
cussions by other interested editors. Feel free to contact me off-line if p=

There is also the question of poetry listservs, one of which I subscribe to.  Does posting poems on this site constitute "publication" or is it just "posting"?  I have always felt free to publish previously posted poems elsewhere.  So far, I have encountered no problems.  But, as in your statement, I have feared for problems down the line.  Are there or will there be any?  Regards, Tom Savage

I think the bias against previously published poems is ridiculous--
like a theater-owner's
refusing to show movies that have been shown in other theaters.

As to guidelines: we hates guidelines.

Dear All,

I'm currently looking for poems for the upcoming issue of Women's Studies=20
Quarterly centered on the theme of Witness. I'm posting this both to ask you=
 to=20
submit poems AND to ask for recommendations for other poets (preferably=20
well-published) you know of who might have work that is fitting. If you have=
 contact=20
info for your recommendees, so much the better. I'll paste the official CFS=20
below, to give you an idea of how the editors conceive the theme, but with=20
poetry the theme can of course be more tenuous.

Publishing in WSQ is a good opportunity to expand your audience to include=20
the largely academic readership. And WSQ is widely adopted for classroom use=

which expands your audience even more.

You may email your submissions or recommendations to me at ossipk@aol.com. I=
n=20
the body of the email, please, not as an attachment. Deadline is a fluid Jul=
y=20
15-ish.

Thank you! CFS below.

Ever have one of those ideas that takes years and years to finally
come to full fruition? You wrote it down, and then waited for the
timing, circumstances, and/or right collaborator to come along. And
you were patient that whole time, eager but patient, never forgetting
the idea. Me too!

Have you ever seen Bembo's Zoo? (http://www.bemboszoo.com/) if you
haven't--you really should, regardless of whether you want to go any
further into this announcement, that's a work well worth your
time. And it's the perfect set-up to the rest; though, if you're Flash
challenged, it's definitely not required.

So ends the preamble. Now, on to the meat of the announcement.

After years of waiting for the perfect collaborator to come along, I
am filled to overflowing with joy to announce:

a as in dog, by Dan Waber & Marko Niemi
a as in dog, by Marko Niemi & Dan Waber

part hommage, part parody, all ultra-minimalist all the time (or,
anything they can do minimal, we can do less)

http://www.logolalia.com/a-as-in-dog/

a full introduction is here:
http://www.logolalia.com/a-as-in-dog/intro.html

Short version for anyone who hasn't already clicked through: a lady
was spelling her name to me over a bad phone connection and she
accidentally said, "a as in dog" instead of "a as in apple" or "a as
in alpha". It made me laugh, it made her laugh, and it got me
thinking. First I figured out a way to make an "a" look like a
dog. Then, I figured out how to make every other letter of the
alphabet into an animal whose name didn't start with that letter
(without repeating start-of-name letters). I lacked the deft touch
necessary to bring these ideas to life until I connected with Marko
Niemi. He built them all better than I ever could have by, in most
cases, making them less than I'd've dared.

If you enjoy viewing these pieces even one 26th as much as we enjoyed
making them you'll be grinning for days.

Come, look, enjoy.

Regards,
Dan & Marko

Hey Chris, exchange mythologies?  Yeah, I feel like my memory is good on
stuff though, and I recall you bringing into town some very important
poets.  As did Gil.  But I didn't know you and Gil had an argument.  Sounds
like a good argument at that, an argument on aesthetics, which is always a
healthy thing, right?

Hey, Chris, I'm not interested in apologizing to this List, or anyone else
for a history of the poor.  The history of the poor is the mostly untold
history.  The rich who are moving into Philadelphia right now literally
think they are moving into a city that they can shape up.  But they have no
idea what it means to live inside a community of artists that was as vibrant
and nurturing as the Zulli Nation was.

There used to be a grocery store with a tiny diner in the back of it called
APPLE JACKS.  I'd hang out there and listen to the drag queen prostitutes
talk shit about the world.  And there was a group of crazy Polish painters
(I think Candace Kaucher knew them?) who would come in arguing and trying to
pick up the tranny hookers.  It was a regular show, but the painters were
especially excited to find out that one of the hookers was a painter, and
another a dancer, and I don't mean an exotic dancer, but going to the
University of the Arts to study dance.  That's what Philadelphia was like
back then.  Literally thousands of artists, writers, philosophers.  But
they're all gone now.  Uprooted, kicked out.  You mentioned Cheryl Dunye.
She used to date my friend Michelle Strader, and they lived on the 4th floor
next to Robin's Bookstore on 13th Street.  Michelle helped Cheryl make
the film THE WATERMELON WOMAN.  But Michelle was a mind blowing painter!
And she was poor, like the rest of us, and had a stupid job, like the rest
of us, and just couldn't wait to get home to do more painting.  And Michelle
and all her neighbors (also artists) were evicted a couple of years ago, and
now fancy, expensive handbag and shoe stores line the street.

The world shifted from an epicenter of passionate creativity to unbridled
consumerism.  And APPLE JACKS is now a swank martini bar with hipsters
bursting from its French windows every night, and this is something I guess
I just need to get used to, this great loss of community.  It's just that
the transition is going on AT THIS MOMENT, and it's a difficult transition
for those of us without the cash to keep up with escalating rents.  But of
course there are plenty of poets here who I know and whose work I Love.
It's kind of amazing to realize that your favorite poets are your friends.
How many people get to say that?  And we're going to be celebrating Gil Ott
soon.

The first time I ever laid eyes on Gil Ott was autumn 1984.  I was a
teenager, and I snuck into the Bacchanal with my friend Pegalina, and Gil
was in the middle of a poem at the microphone.  I was fresh off the country
roads of rural Pennsylvania where the WILDEST thing on the local library's
shelves was Anne Sexton.  And let me tell you, if she is the wildest
poetry you've experienced, then seeing, and hearing Gil Ott is GOING TO BLOW
YOUR MIND!

Gil was almost 17 years older than me, and was supportive without getting in
my business, you know what I mean?  Like, he HATED my boyfriend Angel, but
also realized that Angel was a lot of excitement for me, older, had a
motorcycle, was a drug dealer, always had a party to take me to.  It was a
lot of fun, and Gil knew that I was not about to give up that much fun!  But
he thought Angel was a scumbag, and made it clear he thought this.

Also what I appreciated about Gil is that he was almost ANTI-mentorship.
While there were so many other older poets hanging around (like Etheridge
Knight) who wanted to tell you what you Should read, how you Should be
writing, Gil hated the very idea of ever doing so.  And he gave me one of my
first readings, at the Painted Bride Arts Center with his wife Julia
Blumenreich and Miriam Kessler.

There's so much to remember, and I like writing about this with you Chris.
And I'm not interested in doing the back channel, I mean, if people don't
want to read then they won't, right?  I don't fucking care.

I'm not a poetry magazine editor, but I have an opinion anyway.

  If to publish means to disseminate publicly, how can a blog be anything but a publication? To maintain that it is not is merely to unjustly devalue your blog.

it depends, is your goal to write poems that you think are better or to have
your poems published by people who have restrictive submission guidelines?

right on, kevin and hal. i mean, we're basically playing the same game as s=
ome people in the administration who like to play by exclusivity, and that =
hurts - how do disseminate (see? I didn't say distribute) our work without =
giving it out to the widest possible audience - an audience so small it's s=
illy? If the work is good, if the editors like the work, then publish the d=
amn poems! This is purely a question of ownership and property.

me on this quote...

I'm a little wary of this... Do you mean that well-published poets produce =

Nic,If the jounral in question allows for previously published material (an=
d some do) then there's no conflict. However, if they expressly state they =
want unpublished work, then I would say that it depends on the nature of th=
e blog/listserv you post them to. For example, if you and a circle of say 1=
0 friends have formed a listserv/yahoogroup. . .  to workshop, then I'd say=
 that's alright. If you post poems to a public blog (blogspot etc...), then=
 I'd say it's not alright as most blogs get more hits in a month or two tha=
n the circulation of the average print run of a small press lit journal. Th=
is means that for all intents and purposes the poems posted might not be ne=
w to readers, potentially defeating the editor's reason for running a journ=
al in the first place. In the cases of electronic journals, your post could=
 be in direct competition with the journal that they are in.My 2 cents.Davi=

Stephen, thanks, and yes we need to walk with caution mostly.  In that we
don't forget to admit the truth, and that we don't confuse the truth for the
art.

Spicer was really awful to a lot of people, and I was always curious about
the WAY he attacked Ginsberg.  Of course this is all rumor, I think, but I
think he said something like Ginsberg was writing faggot-poetry.  We can't
really know what he meant by that since it's just rumors that are
circulating.  But what could that have meant?  Especially since Spicer was a
faggot, and living in San Francisco at that.  It's odd.

But at the same time it's impossible to not Love the work of Spicer.  And if
you do Love the poet's work then all that other stuff needs to be held away,
and separate, right?

Dorn's homophobia was a different thing.  Or was it?  I don't know.  It
seems that most homophobic men are themselves queer.  It's almost a cliche
to say this now, but it's also something I've seen play out over and over.
Yeah, maybe Dorn was a secret cocksucker.  Who knows, right?

It would be GREAT to find out something like that!  HEHEHE!  Oh the
bone-chilling reception such evidence was create!

Cracked Slab Books announces the release of The City Visible: Chicago Poetry
for the New Century.  It's an anthology of some of the best innovative
poetry being written currently in Chicago.

Peter Gizzi says of it, "When Carl Sandburg asked in his *Chicago Poems*,
close to a hundred years ago, for "a voice to speak to me in the day end, /
A hand to touch me in the dark room / Breaking the long loneliness," little
did he know his city would be so fully and livingly answered and so honored.
Chicago is again transformed by poetry. Here in these myriad acts of
imagination, the poets of T*he City Visible* give to it again, in
Shakespeare's terms, ' local habitation and a name.'"

You can get your copy at http://crackedslabbooks.com/home.html or from
amazon.com.  It should be up on SPD soon.

C.A.: Thanks for your reply. I only made the exchange public in hopes of
getting thoughtful people to weigh in on the matter. I have a few notes
to your message.

I do not accuse Silliman of being cold, but rather the opposite: that he
lets his personal animus against the man blind him to the rich
possibilities to the later poetry. I admit I may be wrong in my
deduction that Silliman singles out Dorn as contentious because Dorn
notoriously dismissed the notion that something called the language
school had changed and recharged the poetic landscape, but, despite
having read all of Dorn that I can find, and having talked with him a
few times, the notion that he was a nazi or an advocate of violent
solutions remains outside my experience and unattested in the reviews in
question. Silliman's view that Dorn was an implicit supporter of the
policies that led us into Iraq is based on an entirely unsupported
reading of one small poem. His notion that Dorn was a homophobe is, and
this is only my opinion, twisted.

Knopf does not put its reputation on the line by publishing Gluck, who
inhabits a tiny corner of that publishing empire. Those who published
Dorn, on the other hand, declared the importance of the work by doing
so, considering the necessity of a personal commitment. I do not say
that those publications prove his significance; I merely wondered why,
if Dorn's collapse is so obvious that both Silliman and Kleinzahler can
assure us that it is so without adducing significant evidence, so many
small publishers were willing to put their money, time, and reputations
into publishing it.=20

Where, in Silliman's piece, does he talk about "the things Dorn said
outside the poems"? The guy was no saint, and he may have said
intemperate things, and if those things can be used to amplify the sense
of the poems, I'm for that. But Silliman did not do so. The burden is on
those who think Dorn said terrible things to come forward with the
evidence.

You have come forward to--as you say--share, and your thoughts are
welcome. I do not think Silliman was sharing; I think his project was
closer to vilification. I think his reply to me, with its refusal to
confront my arguments, suggests that my supposition is not without
foundation.=20

Subject: Re: Brian Richards on Ron Silliman's blog re: Dorn, and
Silliman's brief reply

I've read this a couple of times now, and didn't respond right away
because
I wanted to be certain of how I felt about it.

This is now a public argument, since you made it public.  (Just in case
someone tells me to mind my own business).

Ron Silliman often pisses me off.  Not always, but some weeks more than
once.  So I can relate to you wanting to take shots at him.  I'm just
not
sure that I agree with the shots you're taking.

It feels to me like you're accusing him of the very thing you would wish
him
to be.  In other words you're accusing him of being cold, of not judging
the
work of Dorn but the man Dorn.  Yet you would also wish for him to be
cold
enough in order to not have his feelings involved at all, and to only
see
the work.

That aside I do believe that Silliman has made clear what of Dorn's work
he
likes, and what he doesn't like.

He has also been very vocal about the man Dorn.  And why not?  Ed Dorn
said
some pretty miserable things, should he be forgiven, should he be Loved
unconditionally?

It doesn't really matter what Ron Silliman thinks about Ed Dorn the man
because Silliman likes the work.  He literally said to a group of us
last
year after a reading in Philadelphia, "Dorn is like finding out
your favorite rock star is a nazi."

I'm not making that up.  He said that.

One of the things I value most about Silliman is that he is unafraid of
expressing his feelings.  While so many want to accuse him of being cold
and
mean, what they miss completely is that he's SHARING SOMETHING!  There
are
plenty of poets from his generation who share nothing when it comes to
feeling.  I have seen them myself.  Cold, almost mechanical in nature.
My
god, in an age of bourgeois poetry where conflict of truth is sublimated
with under-the-breath comments and the impotence of the
passive-aggressive,
it's poets like Silliman we need frankly!

It's really important to get pissed off.  And you were pissed off at
Silliman, that's fair, that's fine.  But really, seriously, should
Silliman,
or anyone else for that matter, EVER judge a poet by the publisher
publishing them?  Because that is part of your argument against Silliman
here, saying that he's NOT WAKING UP TO THE EVIDENCE AROUND HIM WITH
THESE
PUBLISHERS FIGHTING OVER ONE ANOTHER TO PUBLISH DORN!

Please!  Knopf publishes Louise Gluck, and I still think she's a slow
death
to read.  I'd rather piss razor blades than be made to read an entire
Louise
Gluck book!  I don't care if Elvis came back from the dead and said she
was
the One and Only poet to read!  Yet people seem to Love her!  Some
people
never shut up about her!  I'm convinced there are life-sized posters of
her above beds all over America, but I still can't stand her poems!

And it's very important to talk about the things Dorn said outside his
poems.  And also important of course that we examine those things in the
context in which they were said.

Should we judge his poems by this though?  Well, I don't think so, not
at
all.

When visiting Jonathan Williams once I asked him about going to see Ezra
Pound at St. Elizabeth's.  I asked him (to be more exact about my
question
to him) what it was like being a queer man, going to see Pound, someone
who
had openly supported fascism in Europe at a time when queers were being
branded and murdered.  He thought about it for a second and then simply
said, "The terrible things he did and said were not the poems."

And there are plenty of people who refuse to read Pound because of his
politics.  And I like to debate this issue with those people, even
though
they almost always remain solid in not needing to read Pound.

CAConrad
p.s. One of my all-time favorite issues of the CHICAGO REVIEW is the
Dorn
issue, most especially the essay, "Edward Dorn Out: Forms of
Dispossession"
by Dale Smith.  In it Smith writes, "Dorn made himself available to an
experience of the West. In the process he perceived a difference between
who
he was and who he thought himself to be. But what any of us are capable
of
is more important, and that we make ourselves so."

my own practice is to remove the poem from my blog once/if it gets
published and to link to the journal's web site.

There is a children's book that kind of uses the same tactic. Each
page says something like "A is for Cartwheel," or "F is for Pickle,"
but there's a subtle action going on in the artwork on the page that
actually does suggest a word that correctly starts with the letter. Or
something like that.

     How many times does it seem one is reading the same old pieces  (revie=
ws, counter-reviews, posts, counter-posts) again--then to realize with a st=
art--oh my God!--these are the "new" pieces!!--NOT Memorex!!--NOT "phoned i=
n!!--      It is very predictable what Ron Silliman will say about most thi=
ngs and equally so what many of his detractors will say.  The sad thing is =
that in the meanwhile the actual book, poetry, accomplishment--gets complet=
ely ignored.       I have yet to read the book and was hoping to learn more=
 about it as it is a pretty sizable collection (324 or so pages) and includ=
es some uncollected works.  As well, in a time in wich poltical poetry is n=
ot much written, Dorn's work seems a good example to re examing--the ecolog=
ical concerns, the take on the on the sttlement by Ero-Americans of the Wes=
t--many other issues--and the methods of structuring and presenting voicing=
s--personnae--      Also that the work is appearing from Penguin, a world s=
cale publisher--not an academic or small press as the origianl works were--=
and--also that it is edited by Michale Rothenberg, himself a very good poet=
 as well as editor of two other Penguin Selecteds--David Meltzer and Philip=
 Whalen.  And--editor of Big Bridge Journal.  The intro is by another poet =
and editor, Dale Smith--          The reviews and arguments here seem toign=
ore all of this, which seems to me to be quite interesting in considering t=
he book itself--            The constellation of Rothenberg and Smith with =
Dorn and also Whalen and Meltzer is far more intriguing to think on than th=
e same tired old beating the dead corpse of Ed Dorn about things said long =
ago over too many drinks most likely.  The occaision of this constellation =
in the present is to open new ways of thinking on the poets and poetry invo=
lved, rather than always driving around with one's eyes glued to the rear v=
iew mirror and one's conceptions of a poet and their work etched for ever i=
n a stone one put out to the graveyard of one's thoughts long ago.         =
  When i first started reading and really being wound by poetry--it was by =
people like Villon and Rimbaud.  Especially with Villon-murderer, thief, pi=
mp---one is going to be upset what some poet said about another?           =
 I would rather be learning about and following discussions of  the new dir=
ections this book and the others Michael Rothenberg edited may be opening u=
p--it is not everdya after all recent and a living American poet are in Sel=
ected Penguin editions after all--than more dancing on the head of a corpse=
--no matter how tempting an easy bit of fun it is--even in a world filling =
up faster and faster with corpses--> Date: Thu, 24 May 2007 11:12:53 -0400>=

Lost & Found

Show and tell: Torn texts in multiple voices. Fugitive transmissions. Image=
s
and objects lost or abandoned are found and polished. The sound of a slow
train by the green light of half forgotten songs. POEMS ARE FUN, glamour is
made easy. A manual for violence prevention follows ADVANCED TYPING TIPS,
PART 5. Glass negative projections. Offerings from an archive. A slide show
from an abandoned elementary school. What to do when you lose someone. What
to do if you find them. There will be surprises, appearances and absences.
David Gatten, filmmaker, Henry James fan, lover of poems and poets, recent
Guggenheim fellow and aspiring audio book artist, makes bookish films about
letters and libraries and boat and ghosts that are filled with words, some
of which you can read. You can find his films in the permanent collections
of the Whitney Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago but he can rarely
find his glasses. He lives and works by the water in Red Hook, Brooklyn and
Seabrook Island, South Carolina. For tonight's event David has invited some
of his favorite scavengers to present sounds, images and words, either as
they found them or incorporated as elements in compositions of their own
design. Participants include Macgregor Card, Mary Helena Clark, Ellie Ga,
Jenny Perlin, Michael Robinson, Jonathan Schwartz, Phil Solomon and Jessie
Stead. Please go to http://www.poetryproject.com/calendar.php for
participant bios.

Uh, that would be Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.

This does seem to come to a property issue in once sense but who's
property.  It seems the question is one of acceptance (which is nice) or
of being read. Being accepted is one way we (literary fine
artists/poets/writers) are "peer reviewed." If an editor digs what we do,
we're published. It's also proven to be elitist. So, we're elitists in our
aestheics--why not? If you have a different aesthetic, and no one is
publishing along your lines, start a journal/blog/website/other.

So, why post to a blog/website rather than submit to an editor? Well, it's
easy and not too scary. So it seems that the question is one of
resilliance. Chapbook journals pop up all the time because we (literary
fine artists) don't read enough to be familiar with the journals that
already exist (see above). New ideas are exciting, I assume, but 6,000
years ago someone wrote, "there is nothing new under the sun." Another
nickel for the presumed author of that bit.

I think the exciting thing is to come across a new poem that moves me in
some way. I don't care whether it's on screen or on a bathroom wall. No
one owns poetry. Publish where you can and then send me an email.

Spicer, I think it is pretty clear, was talking about a kind of poetry,
not the sexual orientation of the poet.

Rather than stay out of the fray, I'll offer my two bits in regards to
the contents of the Penguin Dorn.  If you are a reader of Dorn, that
is to say, you have taken the time to locate the work that has been
published up to the date of the Penguin edition, don't waste any cash
on buying it.  I haven't had the opportunity to compare it poem for
poem (perhaps it has portions of the Heresy poems that aren't in HIGH
WEST RENDEZVOUS) but the two-three glances I have taken at the table
of contents (one of which was hurriedly hot and sweaty-- take the
potshots-- up in the Poetry Room at City Lights and the other more
extended out drinking with friends at a bar) turned up not one fresh
poem that isn't previously published. Smith's Intro is okay.  It's a
good general introduction to Dorn for the novice, but has little to do
with the text Rothenberg presents, which is rather too bad.  In short,
there's little of interest for anyone with an invested interest in
Dorn.  The nice thing about the penguin book, as with them all, is
that it is "out there" and readily available.

As for the smut-slinging, Silly Man appears to wish to drag all the
nonsense of past commentary by Dorn back into Light.  Brian Richards
is doing an honorable job of calling it out and offering up
opportunity for fresh commentary by maybe some younger readers of Dorn
on this List.

As for the Spicer/Dorn connection.  I find it delightful.  & there is
that great Dorn poem about "the fairy bar", is it?  I don't understand
how one would read Spicer and not get his reasons for finding Ginsberg
so deplorable, same with the Ferlinghetti. Not to say one has to share
in them, or no longer read Ginsberg or Ferls.  That would be rather
silly now, wouldn't it.

I would find it useful if someone would post here why the poems from
LOW COUPS AND HAUT COUPS posted so horribly on Big Bridge (not enough
space between them) aren't in Way West?   Or am i mistaken on that?

Halvard,

An what a wonderful poem it is!

At least in poetry and poetics, it seems that what appears in certain blogs
or lists will be read by more people than what appears in print journals or
books. On the other hand, print has more prestige; it is like owning the
hard cover or paper back version of a book. Finally, who cares.

A more fruitful comparison would be to broadsides. Lists particularly can
function as poetic, thought broadsides. Charles Bernstein just quoted a
section of his talk on scholarship on this list. My guess is that the speech
will be published in a book form somewhere. But his announcement here has a
certain freshness, excitement, urgency -maybe also a touch of advertizing-
that the same in book form will not. The book does imply a certain
hierarchy, settling, regardless of how satisfactory it may be to the
published person. I wonder in fifty years how much our daily ephemera in
lists, etc., will be available to any one interested? Here also, will there
be those which will survive and those which will not, or are they/we all
doomed to the same oblivion, in this democracy of death?

Since almost never has anyone paid for it, it seems poems -and ideas
emerging in the ebb of flow of things, which are also poems- belong to their
creators. Therefore, they can be disseminated any place the poets wish
-ideally, aren't poems/ideas seeds, generating other ones? Therefore,
dissemination -to use an antiquarian teleological phrase- is of their
essence. If an editor is tight-assed enough -I hope I am not flaming anyone
by these words- not to disseminate, he or she can say so.

Ciao,

Murat

MERITAGE PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear Poetry Lover,
As a result of some last minute refinement of the project, DAYS POEM by
Allen Bramhall has further plumped up its page count.  Volume I is now
510 pages, vs the original 494 pages; Volume II went up by one more page
to 442 pages.  As these refinements distracted as from further promoting
the project, Meritage Press is pleased to re-release its RELEASE OFFER,
described below, with a new deadline for sending orders:

Meritage Press,
www.meritagepress.com

A SPECIAL RELEASE OFFER!

A Two-Volume Poetry Collection by Allen Bramhall:
DAYS POEM, Vol. I
510 pages
ISBN: 978-0-9709-1798-0

DAYS POEM, Vol. II
442 pages
ISBN: 978-0-9709-1799-7
Price: $28.00

Meritage Press (www.meritagepress.com) is delighted to announce a
RELEASE SPECIAL OFFER for a unique and ambitious two-volume collection
by Allen Bramhall: DAYS POEM.  Mr. Bramhall describes his project with:

"Begun casually, the writing of Days Poem quickly grew into a daily
necessity to write, even to plug onward. In this way, it resembles a
journal or novel, tho it claims neither genre as its own. It started
with an idea of writing large and embracing extent. It settled (and
unsettled) itself within the compelling philosophical argument that it
is what it is. The thrill of relentlessness and perseverance pushed it
until, you know, it came to an end. As the writer of these pages, I
wanted to play with hobos, and bears, and Tarzan & Jane, and Walden
Pond, and all the words in between. I wanted a little amazement in every
day."


BIO: Allen Bramhall was born by the banks of the Concord River in 1952
and has lived in Massachusetts ever since. He was educated at Franconia
College and Lesley University, and in non-academic places as well. /

MiPOesias regards weblog-published poems as self-published.   Seems like a

appeared then created links to those publications.

As an editor, I'm generally willing to accept poems that have appeared
elsewhere, whether on a blog or in a journal.  CRIT Journal is still fairly
new, so I find that I generally need to include everything that meets my
standards.  All other things being equal, however, if forced to choose, I
would publish a poem that hasn't appeared elsewhere over one that has,
simply because the former is more in need of exposure, so I can understand
why some editors have a policy against previously published work.

As a poet, my solution is a sort of compromise between posting and
not-posting.  I use livejournal and put most of my poems up on a filter that
only allows certain users to see it.  This is generally not considered to be
publication, as it isn't public.

Christophe,

Good question! I can see that my wording is a bit obnoxious. It was merely m=

t=20
with. I certainly don't believe that lots of pubs =3D good quality work,=20
necessarily.

Given that WSQ publishes very few poems per issue (around 10) and that I hav=
e=20
to narrow the field somehow, given that I already have a number of=20
submissions from newer poets, given that the (non-poet) editors would like t=

poems from names that they know, given that I have limited time to send out=20
personal solicitations to poets that others might recommend...that is the wo=
rding=20
I came up with. Sorry if it offended.=20

I will be delighted to read submissions from anyone who has poems centered o=

the theme of Witness.

I appreciate your openness about previously published work.  Since I have never heard of livejournal before, I would like to know more about it.  Also, this is the first time I've heard of the use of "filters" regarding poetry posting or publication.  So I would appreciate knowing exactly what this procedure is and why you choose to use it.

As a poet, my solution is a sort of compromise between posting and
not-posting. I use livejournal and put most of my poems up on a filter that
only allows certain users to see it. This is generally not considered to be
publication, as it isn't public.

Hi all,
=20
I didn't hear too many voices from the editor's perspective on this string.=
 And I think it would help round out the conversation.
=20
Print journals spend anywhere from $100 (Kinkos and a good stapler at home)=
 to upwards of $5000 for a (McNaughton & Gunn) 1,000 print run.=20
=20
The economics of this issue has been very poet-centric.=20
=20
We can argue till we're blue whether or not the print journal is the last b=
astion of bourgeois Kultur, but the fact remains that these folks throw dow=
n cold hard cash to push your product (even if they don't pay you for it; m=
ost don't recoup their losses).=20
=20
So why, if they ask for it, shouldn't they expect fresh material?

Livejournal.com is a blogging site with a strong networking component.  Each
user has, in addition to their blog page, a friends page that compiles
entries from everyone on their list.  More relevant is that people added to
your friends list can read entries that you mark "friends only".  You can
also make custom filters, which is what I use for my poems (because I write
a lot of poems, and that's not what most of the people who read my journal
are interested in).  Because only a very limited audience sees them, the
poems aren't considered previously published by journals that don't accept
previously published work-- so I get an audience that's fairly interested in
my poetry from my blog, and I get a broader audience from these journals.

Sorry, I didn't fully search the Lanham Rhetorical Handlist  first.
Wikipedia credits Proudhon.  My question is: What is "property  is theft" in rhetoric?
 As I look for references to Proudhon and Puttenham,  I find this one on
catachresis (Puttenham's "abuse"): from Pope's Peri  Bathous:

Mow the Beard,
Shave the Grass,
Pin the Plank,
Nail my sleeve.

... sounds like Bob Dylan.

Here's an example of "chiasmus" from Samuel Johnson:

"Your manuscript is both good and original; but the part that is good is  not
original, and the part that is original is not good."

... sounds like me.

Congeries is here.  It means "word heaps."

And, at last, p. 85, Proudhon's "property is theft" is an example of
Horismus, in logic, a clear, brief, pithy definition; for example, Shaw's  "economy
is the art of making the most of life."  In rhetoric, a definition  by
opposites, as in Proudhon's "property is theft."  Puttenham describes  the difference
between logical and rhetorical meanings thus: " ... wisdom is a  prudent and
witty foresight ... this definition is Logical.  The Orator  useth another
manner of definition, thus: Is this wisdom? no it is a certain  subtle knavish
crafty wit, it is no industry, as you call it, but a certain busy  brainsickness."

Sarah Riggs
Water Work
96 pages
Poetry
ISBN 978-0-925904-69-0
$16


=93In five stunning sequences, Sarah Riggs has created a poetics of elastic=
=20
migrations
that imagines the world as clusters, skeins, and motions whose innate
peril is miraculously saved in the act of naming: =93each name for a thing=
 seems
intent to curl from its shelled meaning.=94 Places, histories, persons, myth=
 and
object, intimacy and incident, are precision shorelines of simultaneous=20
apprehension
and erasure. In this subtle and luminous first book, Sarah Riggs
has engaged our most fundamental quandaries in a poetry that announces,
in Stevens=92 phrase, =93a new knowledge of reality.=94
--Ann Lauterbach


Waterwork works=ADin both senses of the word: all its intricate parts are=
 moving
smoothly in sync, and it succeeds. Such productive ambiguity rules the
whole collection, which takes water and language as primary, parallel media,
in the sense of growth media, in which all sorts of fascinating things can=
 be
cultured. In Riggs=92 case, they=92re all unprecedented hybrids of science=
 and
sound. She turns her acute eye to contemporary culture as well as natural=20
history
and her ear to the subtle balances of rhythm and assonance. The result is
a beautiful attention that illuminates nuance, making the everyday world
more detailed and thus more grand.

Linh Dinh

Poetry 146 pages
ISBN 978-0-925904-68-3

Linh Dinh is one of the most consistently surprising writers around. One=20
can find sources & roots for his writing, explain the traces of surrealism=
=20
through the presence, say, of the French in Vietnam (tho they were driven=20

d=94=20
nor =93from=94 any one of these contexts so much as he is through them =96=
 they=20

Imagine what any other poet with this strong a sense of form would have had=
=20
to become in order to write such poetry. Ted Berrigan, for example.=20
Berrigan shares Linh=92s class background, which enables him to be as=20
ruthless in a different way as Linh is in his. But the comparison stops=20
there. Linh is writing straightforward poetry, but from a perspective=20
shared by almost no one else. This kind of exile is far deeper than mere=20
geography. Reading Borderless Bodies, you can feel Linh=92s deep loneliness=
=20
on every page & realize that there are aspects of his poetry that you can=92=

I always wondered why Dorn was so opposed to Language Poetry in the =
early
1970s, calling it "Languish Poetry" in the pages of _Poetry Flash_. (Or =
was
that Tom Clark?) At any rate, it voiced what I've always taken to be =
Dorn's
view. In _Edward Dorn: A World Of Difference_, Clark quotes Dorn's =
emphasis
on "content" as a measure: "I know what meter is, but the way I write is
usually in clots of phrase, and that usually comes out to be Idea, in a
vague sense. I don't think Ideas come in units" (p. 330, a 1961 radio
interview originally in _The Sullen Art_, by David Ossman,1963) Even =
though
Dorn said this to distinguish his practice with metrical and breath-line
poetries, including Olson's, his emphasis on "content" and "Idea" would =
seem
to point to an interesting artistic reason for his antagonism toward
poetries which seem to deny (or at least radically question) such an
emphasis. (I would love to hear more informed views on this matter of =
Dorn's
"content" and "Idea.") If this is so, wouldn't Language Poetry seem a =
step
in precisely the wrong direction?=20

Perhaps there were personal incidents as well. . .? Or different or more
clearly stated objections to Language Poetry? (Would love to hear.)

As a bibliographer of Dorn and a writer deeply indebted Black Mountain
Poetry, as well as all of the poets in Allen's _The New American =
Poetry_, I
would tend to support Dorn generally. But it's hard not to see how the
practice of Language Poetry wouldn't be at least a fresh provocation if =
not
a useful infusion to many poets of Dorn's and slightly earlier =
generations.

Do others have information or insights on this? Why was Dorn so opposed =
to
Language Poetry?  This seems potentially useful to ponder. (I'm =
especially
interested in the issue of "content" or "Idea." I have a sense of this, =
but
. . . )

Rather than stay out of the fray, I'll offer my two bits in regards to
the contents of the Penguin Dorn.  If you are a reader of Dorn, that
is to say, you have taken the time to locate the work that has been
published up to the date of the Penguin edition, don't waste any cash
on buying it.  I haven't had the opportunity to compare it poem for
poem (perhaps it has portions of the Heresy poems that aren't in HIGH
WEST RENDEZVOUS) but the two-three glances I have taken at the table
of contents (one of which was hurriedly hot and sweaty-- take the
potshots-- up in the Poetry Room at City Lights and the other more
extended out drinking with friends at a bar) turned up not one fresh
poem that isn't previously published. Smith's Intro is okay.  It's a
good general introduction to Dorn for the novice, but has little to do
with the text Rothenberg presents, which is rather too bad.  In short,
there's little of interest for anyone with an invested interest in
Dorn.  The nice thing about the penguin book, as with them all, is
that it is "out there" and readily available.

As for the smut-slinging, Silly Man appears to wish to drag all the
nonsense of past commentary by Dorn back into Light.  Brian Richards
is doing an honorable job of calling it out and offering up
opportunity for fresh commentary by maybe some younger readers of Dorn
on this List.

As for the Spicer/Dorn connection.  I find it delightful.  & there is
that great Dorn poem about "the fairy bar", is it?  I don't understand
how one would read Spicer and not get his reasons for finding Ginsberg
so deplorable, same with the Ferlinghetti. Not to say one has to share
in them, or no longer read Ginsberg or Ferls.  That would be rather
silly now, wouldn't it.

I would find it useful if someone would post here why the poems from
LOW COUPS AND HAUT COUPS posted so horribly on Big Bridge (not enough
space between them) aren't in Way West?   Or am i mistaken on that?

Should an editor expect fresh material?

As someone who has been both an editor of money-losing propositions
as well as a writer who hasn't been paid (by other editors who don't
recoup their losses),
I can see how both "sides"--in sofar as their is antagonism between
them---may feel exploited
(of course, nowadays so many are both).

The issue may very well be different if both editor and poet are
making money,
but I'll restrict these notes to what David's talking about....

Perhaps what I say may be seen as taking the side of the
"unpaid writer" rather than the "money-losing editor's" side in what
I say here,
but increasingly I've become very skeptical of the value of such
"freshness"--
as defined as "Previously Unpublished Work."
For me it has had a lot to do with a value of quantity more than
quality--
Yes, they need not be opposed, but I know I'm not the only writer (or
editor for that matter),
who has felt an institutional pressure that thereby places less value
on a single poem
(oh, it's "fetishizing") and more on "author of 19 books, published
in 150 magazines"
and I wonder about alternatives to that
that could benefit both writer and editor

and maybe yes I'm too hung up on what some could deride as "an
economy of scarcity"
or that I like the kind of poems (or whatever) that "even 15, 150,
1500, years later, still feel FRESH"

Well, back when I did I lot more unpaid readings, I largely operated
in a scene in which it was
kind of a badge of honor to not read things that most people in the
audience already heard,
but then I started realizing, when I was in the audience, that if a
reader occasionally did that,
and if the work was good, I actually liked the familiarity.
Perhaps on the page, or the electronic format, it's different,
and laws of intellectual 'property' forbid people from even
'plagiarizing' themselves,
and it can get all touted and glorified as PROCESS-ORIENTED writing
that can't be fetishized
and is free (or at least money-losing for both editor and writer)--
but how free is it?
and how fresh is it?
And what I'm writing now, "of course," isn't a poem by any standards
but in a way I am submitting it
and in a way it is "fresh material"
(okay, now I'll go out to the park and play a festishized song I've
played many times before
but to people who maybe have never heard it, or can hear it with
FRESH EARS).

love, Chris

Is it "pretty clear" George?  Please share.

Because Spicer seemed uncomfortable for some reason.  Was it really JUST
that he didn't like the work?  Wouldn't he take issue specifically then with
the work?  Faggot-poetry is hardly what Ginsberg wrote.  Someone could also
say Spicer was writing faggot-poetry, as being a faggot comes through from
time to time.  Not that Spicer was political in the way Ginsberg was.

It really is an unfair statement on Spicer's part, summing Ginsberg up to
the faggot end of who he was in order to define his poems.

Look, Spicer was a faggot, a big faggot, and wrote about it.

To say "Spicer, I think it is pretty clear, was talking about a kind of
poetry," needs better clarification George.  No it's not clear.  How is
Ginsberg's poetry faggot-poetry?

How is Spicer writing about being a young faggot in the Castro not faggot
writing?

It's not clear, and leaves a lot to question.  When I meet a faggot who
chooses to denounce or diminish another faggot by pointing out that they're
a faggot it's usually that the forked tongue belongs to someone not
comfortable with themselves.

Am I analyzing Spicer?  Yeah, I guess so.  It just doesn't make sense that
THAT is how Spicer chose to make a remark about WHY or HOW he dislikes
Ginsberg's poems.

Spicer could like or dislike whatever he wanted, that was not my point of
course.

But how does calling Ginsberg's poetry faggot-poetry do anything but
ridicule Ginsberg for being a faggot?

Ginsberg was NOT Mark Doty (thank god!), and wrote about many many things.
The only thing that's clear is that Spicer meant harm.  How he chose to harm
is nothing but suspicious to me.

And George, in the end, as odd as this may sound, I'd much rather hear this
kind of statement from a straight man than a queer man.  I dislike queer men
who attack on such a level more than I've ever hated a straight man for
doing so.

Below are 2 Ed Dorn poems "LEFT OUT" of the selected, for those interested
in seeing WHAT has been so casually "left out" of the "hoopla."  These are
the kinds of poems that really REALLY piss me off!  As someone who lost a
boyfriend to AIDS, this shit makes me want to raise Dorn from the dead and
kick his ass!

When you read these two poems you will realize that when Jonathan Williams
said of Pound that, "The terrible things he did and said were not the poems"
cannot EVER apply to Dorn, not with poems like these in existence.

Am I saying we can't or shouldn't look at the rest of Dorn's work held apart
from this?  We should do that, yes, but we should not EVER forget that he
wrote these poems!
With LOVE and faggot-poetry,

C.A.,
Neither homo- nor htero- really, seem at issue when coming at them (along
with bi- anti- a-, etc . . . ) from the perspective of poeisis.  I rather
think that the "doings" of poets, in the world, make of them (us) all a kind
of contextual "text", and insofar as Freud associated "text" with the third
phase of the anal/oral/genital developmental cycle of the Person (or at
least I think he did . . . anyway, I DID read it "somewhere" . . . ), I have
always thought of the question of sexuality, in poetry, and as composers of
it, having to do with the sense of utter peril, represented by the figure of
the hermaphrodite, which, as James Elkins, in his What Painting Is, says
"acts as an embodiment of psychosis in a conceptual field that is attracted
by madness."  Thus: the tropaic, as the combinatory element of sexuality, no
matter its gender or assumed properness of practice.  Well, though, too,
aren't we all a bunch of cock-suckers - its the badge of signification we
wear, pride, in deed of our art.  The art of the Unvert.  Now THAT'S a sense
that needs considerably more development . . . maybe we should think of the
"luz" as more a product of the Medulla Oblongata than what the ancient
Greeks colloquially called The Necessity.

Stephen, thanks, and yes we need to walk with caution mostly.  In that we
don't forget to admit the truth, and that we don't confuse the truth for the
art.

Spicer was really awful to a lot of people, and I was always curious about
the WAY he attacked Ginsberg.  Of course this is all rumor, I think, but I
think he said something like Ginsberg was writing faggot-poetry.  We can't
really know what he meant by that since it's just rumors that are
circulating.  But what could that have meant?  Especially since Spicer was a
faggot, and living in San Francisco at that.  It's odd.

But at the same time it's impossible to not Love the work of Spicer.  And if
you do Love the poet's work then all that other stuff needs to be held away,
and separate, right?

Dorn's homophobia was a different thing.  Or was it?  I don't know.  It
seems that most homophobic men are themselves queer.  It's almost a cliche
to say this now, but it's also something I've seen play out over and over.
Yeah, maybe Dorn was a secret cocksucker.  Who knows, right?

It would be GREAT to find out something like that!  HEHEHE!  Oh the
bone-chilling reception such evidence was create!

They can certainly incorporate other aspects of The Invisible Man (book, film, art, etc.) but they need to have some kind of reference to the television show. The show had it's dark side, but also a very human and compasionate side, and included occasional humor. You can find some pretty long clips on YouTube. Here are a couple samples: Number 1, Number 2.


Thanks for your interest.

C.A.,

It might be a good idea if you find the exact quote and context of
Spicer's "faggot-poetry" comment on Ginsberg. I think you'll find it's
not the exact phrase and that Spicer is responding the "Beat"
phenomenon which swept SF post-Howl (1955), Duncan-Blaser-Spicer felt
pretty much not a part of the that "Renaissance since they'd already
had their own (Berkeley 40s which included Rexroth, Everson Fabili,
Miles, etc) if this is something you already know, sorry for repeating
it to you but your post doesn't show your very clear on what's what...
for instance, Spicer did not live in or near or frequent the Castro
much.  He hung around North Beach and Polk Gulch, also he died '65,
I'm not certain on this (and would be happy to be corrected) but the
Castro was quite the same Castro in his day. I guess my point is it's
a good idea to get to the texts (read them pretty closely) and
additional commentaries before you start to "analyze".  Cheers, PJD

I love Reb's thinking about editorship.

I think in many ways, small press print anthologies are starting to
replace journals.  I remember fondly QRL as well as the New Directions
annual, and am thinking of both when I think about something
periodical for my press and art-related publishing thoughts.

I feel a lot of pressure to "write to order" perhaps parallel with my
eAuthor endeavors.  I.e., I know what editor y likes, and I try to
find something I wrote I think editor y might like.  I have been
playing with letting this push my writing around rather than the whole
pushing my craft / career thing.  It is interesting, but also quite
painful, when the things you write that you think are really quite
wonderful aren't what editor y, or indeed, it seems any editor, wants.
 And isn't this the same as  print?  Or, it seems the same and also
different somehow.

Forgive my typos--or at least don't use them to invalidate the need
to say, to write, something quick.
I'm forgiving myself for them right now, but I still stand by the
feelings/meanings

How's this?

Editors, feel free to republish old poems you like if a writer you asked
if the writer sends you a new piece you don't like

And writers, feel free to send something you already published
if an editor asks you for work but then ends up rejecting your new
'fresh' piece

It may not make things better, but I can't see how it would make
things worse

For Byron (text)

Behold, the morning watch was come; the vessel lay
Behold, her course, and gently made her liquid way;
Behold the cloven billow flashed from off her prow
Behold, in furrows formed by that majestic plough;
Behold the waters with their world were all before;
Behold behind, the South Sea's many an islet shore.
Behold the quiet night, now dappling, 'gan to wane,
Behold, dividing darkness from the dawning main;
Behold the dolphins, not unconscious of the day,
Behold, swam high, as eager of the coming ray;
Behold the stars from broader beams began to creep,
Behold, and lift their shining eyelids from the deep;
Behold the sail resumed its lately shadowed white,
Behold, and the wind fluttered with a freshening flight;
Behold the purpling ocean owns the coming sun,
Behold, but ere we break--a deed is to be done.

One thing that's seemed to've gone missing is the connectiobetween Dorn and
such 60s and 70s figures as Richard Grossinger, Harvey Bialy, Harvey Brown,
Gerrit Lansing (who Dorn called "a hip scholiast") and the whole "LSD"
Buffalo school, not only Olson and Creeley, but also John Clarke, who wrote
an interesting review of Dorn's Abhorrences in his magazine intent in the
early 90s.  We ought not forget, too, that Dorn's metaphysics were "native",
ie., not so much "tribal" as coming from the landforms themselves, and the
use that was made of them.  Carl Sauer, at that end.  And also not to forget
that Dorn is the one who said, "what makes (Whitehead's) Process and Reality
heavy is the "and".  One good entry into the work of Dorn, I think, is J. H.
Prynne's short essay "A Note on Metals", with its deft turnings and
considerations of abstraction, and the exilic nature of "naming", even as
this operates as an actualizing form of spiritual election.  This is Dorn's
base-line for the sociological satires of Gunslinger, and the shorter, later
work.  (And of whose "flatness"

as Silliman called it, we might remember that Robin Blaser remarked the same
quality on hearing Dorn read what Blaser thought were sonnets at the
Berkeley conference in 1965.

      How many times does it seem one is reading the same old pieces
(reviews, counter-reviews, posts, counter-posts) again--then to realize with
a start--oh my God!--these are the "new" pieces!!--NOT Memorex!!--NOT
"phoned in!!--      It is very predictable what Ron Silliman will say about
most things and equally so what many of his detractors will say.  The sad
thing is that in the meanwhile the actual book, poetry, accomplishment--gets
completely ignored.       I have yet to read the book and was hoping to
learn more about it as it is a pretty sizable collection (324 or so pages)
and includes some uncollected works.  As well, in a time in wich poltical
poetry is not much written, Dorn's work seems a good example to re
examing--the ecological concerns, the take on the on the sttlement by
Ero-Americans of the West--many other issues--and the methods of structuring
and presenting voicings--personnae--      Also that the work is appearing
from Penguin, a world scale publisher--not an academic or small press as the
origianl works were--and--also that it is edited by Michale Rothenberg,
himself a very good poet as well as editor of two other Penguin
Selecteds--David Meltzer and Philip Whalen.  And--editor of Big Bridge
Journal.  The intro is by another poet and editor, Dale Smith--          The
reviews and arguments here seem toignore all of this, which seems to me to
be quite interesting in considering the book itself--            The
constellation of Rothenberg and Smith with Dorn and also Whalen and Meltzer
is far more intriguing to think on than the same tired old beating the dead
corpse of Ed Dorn about things said long ago over too many drinks most
likely.  The occaision of this constellation in the present is to open new
ways of thinking on the poets and poetry involved, rather than always
driving around with one's eyes glued to the rear view mirror and one's
conceptions of a poet and their work etched for ever in a stone one put out
to the graveyard of one's thoughts long ago.           When i first started
reading and really being wound by poetry--it was by people like Villon and
Rimbaud.  Especially with Villon-murderer, thief, pimp---one is going to be
upset what some poet said about another?            I would rather be
learning about and following discussions of  the new directions this book
and the others Michael Rothenberg edited may be opening up--it is not
everdya after all recent and a living American poet are in Selected Penguin
editions after all--than more dancing on the head of a corpse--no matter how
tempting an easy bit of fun it is--even in a world filling up faster and
faster with corpses--> Date: Thu, 24 May 2007 11:12:53 -0400> From:

if i could write the proper theoretical accompaniment here, i would do so;
that i can't, literally goes without saying. it's too much; my chaotic
life allows at best fleeting glimpses into the grounding of the dream in
the real, the real in the dream - wait a minute, since there's neither,
since whatever analysis one might (dreamily) apply, as in a dream, takes
time beyond sleep, the dream screen-work inscribed, which takes place, as
in a dream, the real, which is the real. here avatar, who i dare not name,
to whom i dare not give a name, turns her, yes her, uncanny eye, movement,
muscle memory, towards that dancer of the dream, maud liardon, who has now
retreated back into the dream, the dream of maud liardon, as enacted by
this avatar, now my friend, my being, my dream, my very being, this avatar
who shall remain nameless, who refuses to name me, who has come forward to

Alan,

This is quite something. Are all the lines in it yours, coming out of the
depth of your understanding of the English language?

Reminds me of early 20th century Turkish Sufi poems:

            Ascension

you'll ascend the stairs slowly
on your skirts a golden pile of leaves
always you'll be looking at the East crying

           Always looking at the East crying to be revived

waters are yellowing ... your face paling in shadows
bending roses bleed bleeding to the ground
wait flame like on branches nightingale
has water burnt why is the marble bronze

           From yellow to bronze to crimson to night is the fiery movement
of the soul in its ascent.

           Fire is reflected light in the evening twilight, soon to be
replaced by the reflected light of the moon.

           The nightingale and the branch on which it stands become one,
waiting together.

wait flame like on branches nightingale

look at the crimson sky turning evening


            Ahmet Hasim, 1926


Ciao,

Murat

The text poem is a stanza of Byron's with 'Behold' added to every line. He
uses the word fairly often, as do the English romantics in general; with
Byron, it's 'Byronic,' the sweep of the world, involvement of the reader
with the sublime. It's napoleonic. Byron's one of my favorite authors; Don
Juan is deliberately postmodern which makes it postmodern, if 'anything'
is. I have an odd 1828 French edition of his collected poems, so it goes.
The poem you give below is beautiful.
Thanks, Alan

Murat, the poem you posted below is truly stunning. I've recently been
gobbling up the novels of Orhan Pamuk and that reading, particularly My
Name is Red, has left me with a powerful thirst for modern and
contemporary Turkish literature. Can you recommend any English language
anthologies or other sources?
Thanks,
Jason

Hi Jason,

The poem I quoted is from Eda: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish
Poetry(Talisman House, 2004). Risking to sound arrogant, it is a
stunning book,
with amazing poems in them and a number of very interesting essays.

Then, there are books on individual poets: Ece Ayhan. A Blind Cat Black and
Orthodoxies (Sun and Moon Press, 1997) and Orhan Veli, 1989). Ayhan and Vel=
i
are two very different poets. Veli's poetry is unique, once addicted to it,
unforgettable. Ayhan has a crucial place in Turkish poetry, both
linguistically and thematically, exploring gay and other "peripheral"
voices.

Talisman House has also published poetry books by Ilhan Berk and Enis Batur=
.
When the manuscript is ready, it will publish my translation of the entiret=
y
of Seyhan Eroz=E7elik's Rosestrikes and Coffee Grinds. Selections from this
book are in the Eda anthology and in the 2006 translation issue of Bombay
Gin. Ed Foster, Talisman's editor, has a great love for Turkish poetry. I
would check the Talisman catalogue regularly for new work. I think the next
publication of Turkish work is a novel, which is about to come out. Ed
Foster and I are participating in a symposium on the translations of Turkis=
h
works which will take place in Istanbul this coming week end.

I am glad you loved Pamuk's work and the poem I have posted. In my view the
20th century Turkish poetry has been an invisible power house, like
anti-matter, whose effects will be clearer as the 21 century develops.  I
know the translator of My Name Is Red, Goknar, who teaches at Duke
University. The special quality you must have felt in that novel is very
much related to the concept of Eda which I developed in the anthogy. We had
a discussion about it last summer, he giving a talk about how he struggled
to keep Pamuk style in that novel. He told me his own word for Eda is "the
storm of words," which is true. Turkish poetry moves as a story of words.

Ciao,

Murat

We've discounted our ticket price for those who purchase online.  However,

afford the full (or even discounted) ticket price. The Mad Hatters are
socialistically inclined, demented and proudly anarchistic.  Just help us t=
o
keep the mag going!  It's growing, explanding, evolving, involving,
revolving, getting dizzier and dizzier, a veritable whirling dervish of a

Millas tales, and the.... blah blah blah.  See, read, and listen for
yourselves!

Subject:      PLEASE help end genocide of Philadelphia's trans-community...

Over the years in Philadelphia I have attended a number of memorials for
transgendered people, some of them in the form of drag show memorials.  And
in every single case the trans person was murdered.  And in every single
case the murderer was not charged and no police investigation was
undertaken, despite protests.

THIS TIME we really have had enough!  Erika Keels had just turned 20 this
March when she was run over four times.  The police ruled her death an
accident despite the fact that even the medical examiner agrees that there
is no doubt Erkia was run over four times.  Erika's murderer is a free man
today.

One of the things we are doing is appealing to people outside Philadelphia
to review the petition and sign it in order to let the Philadelphia justice
system realize that the world is aware, word is spreading, and that everyone
everywhere means business!

Here's the post on the PhillySound (today's date) about the brand new
petition:  http://PhillySound.blogspot.com

Thank you for your time, it's much appreciated!

Subject:      Russian poetry in New Zealand
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

New Zealand's longest running and best known journal of literature, arts and
culture, Landfall, has just published a special issue devoted to Russia,
which I have co-edited with Gregory O'Brien, Evgeny Pavlov and Ian Wedde.
The issue includes previously un-translated poems by major Russian poets,
new essays and interviews by Russian writers relating to contemporary
Russian literary culture. An announcement about the issue and details on how
to order a copy appear below.
Best wishes,
Jacob Edmond

Landfall 213: the 'Russia' issue

A Russian anthology of New Zealand poetry, Land of Seas, was published in
Moscow in 2005. Now New Zealand is reciprocating with a special issue of
Landfall that includes contemporary Russian writing and art.

Edited by Jacob Edmond, Gregory O'Brien, Evgeny Pavlov and Ian Wedde, the
'Russia' issue features a selection of previously untranslated works by
contemporary Russian poets: Arkadii Dragomoshchenko, Anna Glazova, Dmitry
Golynko, Alexei Parshchikov, Olga Sedakova, Alexandr Skidan, Viktor Sosnora.
Many of these translations have been created by leading New Zealand poets
working in collaboration with Edmond and Pavlov. The issue also features a
wide range of writing on contemporary Russian literary and art cultures,
economies and diasporas.

As well as bringing Russian literature and art to New Zealand readers, the
issue surveys the ways in which New Zealand writers have engaged-as
travellers, readers and scholars-with Russia and its people.

Landfall 213 also includes an account by the curator Marcus Williams of the
Blue Noses, whose comic video satires were a highlight of the 2005 Venice
Biennale and whose work is substantially represented here.

You're right.
I should not expect language to be important

I'm not sure that we are using the terminology the same way here.
Maybe it would help if we had Spicer's actual words here.
Are we perhaps arguing about something that arrived as a rumour
and might be coloured by the usage of the person bringing it?

Did Jack say that Allen was a faggot writing poems, or a poet
sometimes writing faggot poems? Again, we would have to see Jack's
actual words.

>

Where is that? In the Spicer poem I read today, "Helen," there is a
section
that is a little love poem addressed to Russell FitzGerald.
He mentions loving Russell, and I hear it as a love poem,
an encomium among other things.

When did he do that? I have never heard of Spicer being around the
Castro.

This needs explaining, at least to me. In your usage, or the usage
there,
does "faggot"equal "gay"?

George,

I have no problem with your wanting to be our grammatical governor here,
but the way in which you do it equates a single instance of a danglling
modifier to the experience of losing a boyfriend to AIDS, and makes your
comment seem particularly peevish and possibly cruel. Does language use
matter? Yes, of course. Does a single violation of a grammatical rule that
was probably committed due to writing with passion and speed in an informal
medium bear an equal weight to a life of a loved one lost to AIDS? Not even
close, my friend.

ummm, are we actually going to pretend on this list that there's a
thing called grammar, the rules of which we all agree on, that apply
to a single use of a language we are all speaking identically? That's
the silliest thing I've heard all week.

also, are we going to expect that poets are less frail and full of
folly than the rest of humanity, and be surprised when a few very
good and famous ones turn out to be unsavory characters, perhaps only
at certain junctures in their life? At least Dorn's not Heidegger,
and Silliman's not Burroughs. Unless some of the "missing text" CA's
leaving out includes Dorn or Spicer sympathizing with Nazis and
Silliman shooting his wife.

apologies if this sounds glib, trying to get some bearings in this
discussion that is getting increasingly bizarre,

Dillon

I would never discount that kind of suffering, experience. I went with
a dear friend
to another friend's funeral after his death by AIDS, and then when my
dear friend
was dying of AIDS in St Paul's hospital, I stood by his bed and saw all
the awful things
they were doing in his last week . But you know, I didn't want to kill
anyone or even
kick anyone. I spent the last three years of my wife's life changing
the bags over the
artificial holes in her body while she got skinnier. It was not an easy
three years, but
I didn't want to perform violence on anyone .

I can see how the first poem here would cause hurt for some readers,
yes.
Especially when taken apart from all the impolite criticism of
"America" in the
whole book. Yes. As to the second one, well, it appears to me that Dorn
is
attacking the establishment's attitude toward poverty among other
things.

But okay, I take you upsetness as real.
I know that I think Whitman's a great poet,
but I am upset by his threat to subjugate my country.

Oh, shit. Yeah, I agree with Mr. Conrad, those are pretty
objectionable. I will look at the appropriate context of what else
Dorn was writing at the time, but I see why there's a stink.

In this day of Memorial (in the USA), a curious note.
T.S. Eliot's, The Wasteland,  I was told last night, is no longer covered b=
y
copyright. Anyone - a big or small press or Online publication -  can
reprint it with new  'non-authorized' introductions or prefaces.

I gather Eliot's executors were very tight about giving permissions, and
getting top pound or dollar or whatever the currency.

It will be curious to see how this one plays out in a now momentarily
'horizontal' publishing market place - or the ways in which a particular
publisher might vault the work back into the most sought after edition -
with 'privileged'  but different new introductions by previously
unacceptable  x, y or z critics.

And how new publications of "The Wasteland" play against the Eliot that
remains under copyright.

As someone who remembers too well when The Wasteland was the heavily
protected crown-jewel  in many an English Department, it's curious to see
the jewel thrown  back to 'the commons'. And what that might portend.

Probably, for sure, a whole bunch of people in the textbook, etc. publishin=
g
industry who are grateful not to have to write and pay the Eliot Estate for
permission to reprint the work.

... these are the poems Stephen Vincent has been preparing to write his
entire life. They definitely pass the =B3take the top of your head off=B2 test.

At long last is Walking Theory, Stephen Vincent=B9s observant, large-hearted
poems bundled into book form, engaging architecture, people on the move, th=
e
seasons and other transience, the talk that binds the day: Goodbye,
rhetoric, the desperate,/what can the poem do, walking, step-by-step:/
witness, suffer, hope. Urbane and companionable, rare virtues flaunted here=

curbside delight.  Bill Berkson

Stephen Vincent's work here preserves and enhances the ancient association
of the foot as measure of the poetic line. In Walking Theory measure become=
s
metaphor:  =B3...foot ever to the ground, image by image, /thought by thought=

he moves through the days, from the grief-stricken rhythms of the opening
section of elegies to the more expansive tours of the San Francisco
neighborhoods where he lives and works.  Vincent celebrates the beauty of
these familiar landscapes, as well as strange, unexpected and sometimes
mundane details. In a wonderful pun that arises in the midst of the naming
of spring flowers, =B3the dotted eye=B2 suggests the I of linguistic convention
as the seeing, moving body=B9s eye transformed by language. Finally, in this
serious play of words, the poets asks: =B3what can the poem do, walking,

Some of you may have seen the piece i am working on at the moment at =20
http://vispo.com/nio/pens/springs7.htm or the screenshots of it at =20
http://vispo.com/nio/pens/screenshots

It is quite early on, actually. there will be two versions, =20
eventually. the free online version will house a dozen 'poems'; =20
currently there are only two: TIME and Niolog; you move between them =20
by clicking the arrows around the box on the toolbar (at the bottom) =20
that says either "TIME" or "Niolog", depending on which poem you're =20
currently wreading.

I will also develop a version to sell online. This version will also =20
allow the wreader to import his/her own animations or bitmaps =20
(possibly video also) as 'inks' for 'nibs' of the pen. The wreader =20
will be able to save both bitmaps and animation sequences.

So it is meant as both a tool and a work of art. I am not going to =20
give it the granularity we might associate with a design pen, e.g., =20
fine measurement parameters concerning radius, variable nib geometry, =20
and so on, though there may be a bit of that.

In any case, I have begun doing a bit of research into what has been =20
done previously concerning software pens with multiple nibs. And, =20
also, I am of course curious what has been done pre-software.

Unfortunately, what comes to mind first to me is Kafka's In the Penal =20
Colony. In that short story by Franz Kafka, the torturer's assistant =20
beseeches a visiting dignitary to save an artifact of diabolical =20
invention. 'Criminals'are placed on a bed of pain where their crime is =20
inscribed on their flesh by a writing device with multiple 'nibs'.

Secondly, Dr. Octopus comes to mind, from Spiderman. He has multiple =20
'arms', sort of like an octopus, but metal claws, very dangerous. Not =20
a pen, of course, but you see the association. Multiple 'limbs'.

I don't think my project has that sort of tone to it, of course. On =20
the contrary, it is meant to be an instrument of delight and writing =20
afresh. Yet one is aware that such projects can also acquire a kind of =20
darkness via their extensions of the human; technologies are =20
extensions of our humanity. Or our inhumanity, such as the case may =20
be. Such as the person and use may be. I can't see how my piece will =20
be capable of wreaking havoc, in any case.

Although it does present a different notion of the pen and the act of =20
writing poetry. It's a kind of visual poetry tool/generator/display. =20
It will be nice not only as a compositional tool but as something you =20
can use as a screensaver, for instance.

I have started to do a bit of google work with searches such as =20
"multiple nibs" and "design pens". Searching google for "multiple =20
nibs" yields some interesting results that I want to mention.

The first such result is =20
http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6195100.html . This is quite a =20
curious patent issued in 2001. It is a patent by Corel, the software =20
company that makes CorelDraw and CorelPaint, which are like =20
Illustrator and Photoshop, respectively. Here we have a patent for "A =20
method and system...for rendering a brush stroke with multiple nibs =20
which are added to a center point indicated by a cursor, and the =20
position and movement of each nib are controlled based on variables =20
which can be set by a user."

I used CorelPaint's "image sprayer" many years ago (about 1996-1999) =20
to make many of the images at http://vispo.com/I including the =20
Pornomorphs and an earlier piece I did called "The Pen". The patent =20
concerns precisely this feature of CorelPaint. I don't believe it's a =20
feature of CorelDraw. The "image sprayer" lets you assign multiple =20
bitmaps to multiple nibs, and configure the motion of the nibs around =20
the pen.

It does not let you assign animations to the nibs, unlike my piece. =20
Also, my piece will be quite different in the sorts of motion that you =20
may assign to the nibs. The differences will arise rather naturally =20
from the different uses. The "image sprayer" is a design pen only, =20
whereas i am making a more multi-faceted thing to function as a design =20
pen, a screensaver, and a work of art. Also, the introduction of =20
animations as nibs changes what you'd want the pen to be able to do, a =20
bit.

I thought it was quite curious that in my research into this subject =20
the first thing I should come upon is a patent, and a patent for a =20
software feature that has been, in some sense, the inspiration for my =20
piece.

Yet one could easily argue that the Corel patent is a bit odd. For =20
instance, there are many works of net art that use a similar idea. For =20
instance, you don't have to hunt long at =20
http://www.re-move.org/index2.php to find works where multiple 'nibs' =20
are used very like a pen. It's quite a 'natural' idea--natural in the =20
sense that it is an obvious consequence of the ability to construct a =20
pen with software. But Corel was somehow able to patent their idea. I =20
would have thought it would have been too obvious to qualify as a =20
patent.

I am not sure what repercussions this may have on my project.

Curious.

The second link I've found, so far, concerning "multiple nibs" is =20
http://www.creativemac.com/2004/02_feb/reviews/studioartist3040219.htm =20
. This is a review of a piece of software called Synthetik Studio =20
Artist 3.0 for the Mac. An excerpt from the review:

"Synthetik bills the software as the world's first "graphics =20
synthesizer," a musical metaphor inspired, no doubt, from the =20
developer's history in the audio industry. John Dalton, who heads up =20
Synthetik, was the creator of Pro Tools (now owned by Avid/Digidesign) =20
and Deck I/II (now owned by Bias). What it means is that the software =20
is designed to be for professionals in the visual arts what a =20
synthesizer is to pros in music production..."

Synthetik Studio Artist includes a pen with multiple nibs.

But I am also interested to see what sorts of pens--apart from =20
Kafka's--were devised pre-computer. I expect there has been some =20
interesting work done, but I have not found any of it yet.

I am currently in Amsterdam, for the first time, and am taken with the =20
ingenuity all around me, and the profoundly well-nurtured =20
relationships here between nature, art, and technology.

Which means that copyright after the death of the Author is of 75 years, if
I am reading right.
I think it lasted longer just a few years ago, probably just before 1998.

Subject:      Reminder: Poetry at Parasol Unit, Tuesday, 5 June
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

  The Parasol Unit poetry series is pleased to invite you to our next reading on Tuesday, 5 June, at 6:30 PM, with Bill Berkson, Michael Glover, and Ernesto Priego.

  Bill Berkson, poet, critic, and teacher, was born in New York City in 1939. A longtime resident of California, he has for many years taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. He is the author of sixteen books and pamplets of poetry, most recently Our Friends Will Pass Silently Among You (The Owl Press, 2007) and Gloria (Arion Press, 2005, with etchings by Alex Katz). Other recent books include Sudden Address: Selected Lectures 1981-2006 (Cuneiform Press, 2007), What’s Your Idea of a Good Time: Letters & Interviews 1977-1985 with Bernadette Mayer (Tuumba Press, 2006), and The Sweet Singer of Modernism & Other Art Writings (Qua Books, 2004). Ron Padgett writes: "Bill Berkson's writing is witty, musical, daily, and deep, underpinned by a bracing integrity and shot through with gorgeous abstraction and other brilliant hookups between eye, ear, mind, and heart."

    Michael Glover has written art criticism for The Times, The Economist, The Independent, and The Financial Times, among others. He is the author of several books and chapbooks of poetry, including Amidst All This Debris (2001) and The Bead-Eyed Man (2000), both from Dagger Press, and Impossible Horizons (Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995). Of his new book, For the Sheer Hell of Living, to be published this year by San Marco Press, John Ashbery writes, "Michael Glover’s lines unspool gravely and efficiently with few commas like waves that know they are on the way to someplace but without making much fuss about it. They can be piercingly sad and hilariously wry, sometimes at the same time, as: ‘Someone loses the midge swat./ Many glasses are raised.’—this from a poem called ‘Few things happen.’ Few things happen here, true, but those that do are tremendously important even when tiny."

  Ernesto Priego is a Mexican poet, essayist, and translator presently living in London. He is the author of Not Even Dogs (Meritage Press, 2006) as well as the blogs "Never Neutral" (http://neverneutral.wordpress.com/) and "The Jainakú Project"  (http://thejainakuproject.blogspot.com/). A recent interview with him can be found on Tom Beckett’s blog "e-x-c-h-a-n-g-e-v-a-l-u-e -s" (http://willtoexchange.blogspot.com).




    The readings at Parasol Unit are organized and introduced by Barry Schwabsky. Previous readers have been Tim Atkins, Guy Bennett, Peter Cole, Kelvin Corcoran, Linh Dinh, Carrie Etter, Allen Fisher, Mark Ford, Lee Harwood, Lyn Hejinian, Sue Hubbard, Vincent Katz, Tony Lopez, Drew Milne, Redell Olsen, Anthony Rudolf, Leslie Scalapino, Barry Schwabsky, John Seed, Simon Smith, Carol Szymanski, Catherine Wagner, and Barrett Watten.

  Readings begin at 6:30 PM and are free to the public. Parasol Unit is located at 14 Wharf Road, London N1, near the Old Street and Angel tube stations.

Talking Leaves...Books, 3158 Main St.

George Bowering, Canada's first poet laureate, was born in the Okanagan Val=
ley and schooled on the West Coast and in Montreal. His work is inescapably=
 rooted in British Columbia, including stories of growing up in the Okanaga=
n, haunting poems of urban Vancouver and innovative recountings of historic=
al events in B.C. A distinguished novelist, poet, editor, professor and his=
torian, known for his discerning wit and irreverent humour, Bowering has au=
thored more than eighty books, which include works of poetry, fiction, auto=
biography, biography and young adult titles. A tireless supporter of fellow=
 writers and committed advocate for the arts, he is a prominent literary cr=
itic and a dedicated Canadian literary ambassador at international conferen=
ces and readings. His writing has also been translated into French, Spanish=
, Italian, German, Chinese and Romanian. After serving as an aerial photogr=
apher in the Royal Canadian Air Force, Bowering attended the University of =
British Columbia where he earned a B.A. in History and an M.A. in English. =
He is one of the founders-along with Frank Davey, Fred Wah, Daphne Marlatt =
and Jamie Reid-of the vant-garde poetry and poetics magazine TISH. Bowering=
 has taught at the University of Calgary, the University of Western Ontario=
 and Simon Fraser University. In 2002, Bowering was recognized by the Vanco=
uver Sun as one of the most influential people in British Columbia.

Also, look for Geoffrey Hlibchuk's interview with Bowering in this coming T=

Amen!

Copyright is the author's life plus 70 years for works created on or after
January1, 1978.  For works created prior to that, the term of protection is
for a total of 75 years.  For works created by multiple individuals or under
the auspices of an organization (e.g., Disney) the term can be 95 years from
first publication or 120 years from original creation, whichever is less.
The revision to the copyright act enacted by Public Law 105-298 (October 27,
1998) was done, from what I can discern, to protect corporate interests,
particularly Mickey Mouse.

It's even more complex--the 75 yr term was for works under copyright
as of 1978 (1976 revision)--that is, the  revision affected all works
still under their first or second 28 year terms of protection (which
were potentially all works published after 1922)--works published
before 1922 have fallen into the public domain, I think; though I may
be mistaken....

May seem to be, but it's not a simple as that. Actually, it's a complex web to difficult to unravel here. We party have none other than Sonny Bono to thank for the mess. There are a number of sites that map out the various routes a copyright can take. The only hard rule is anything published before 1923 is in the public domain. Anything after follows a complex route of inquiry, depending on when it was first copyright and then when and/or if the copy right was renewed. If you're interested, find a reliable chart on the internet. Places like LibriVox.org is particularly astute with this stuff, because it is publishing annually (for free) hundreds of PD works of lit, sciences, etc. Worth looking there.

Does anyone know how this applies to non-USA works? Is it still dependent
on when they were published in the USA? And what about translations? Are
translations of foreign authors published before 1923 now in the public
domain? Does this depend at all on copyright laws of the country of origin
of the original work (not the translation)? And what about foreign authors
in general? Are all 19th & early 20th Century French poets' works in the
public domain? Can anyone both publish the work in its original language
and a new translation, without fear of repercussions? Or is this all on
LibriVox.org? I'll look.

it is nearly impossible to prove a copyright wasn't renewed, even if
it wasn't -- your local US library has the copyright books, and you
can look at them in a several-years-around-likely-renewal, all likely
names of relatives, companions, and variations of the author name, but
not finding a renewal -- well, it is difficult to prove

Great fun to read all this comments on the copyright-issue. Copyright is for
lawyers. Let’s write just a few poems worth stealing, that’s the real agenda
for poets. http://www.theliteraryreview.org/edchoice/hugus_50_3.html

The Wasteland has been out of copyright a few years now. Two results that sit in my library is Yale U Press's The Annotated Wasteland w/ Eliott's Contemporary Prose and Norton's critical edition of Easteland, both good editions and useful for classroom use.

Joyce's Ulysses now exists in differing editions, with varying critical apparatus as part of competing for classroom market.

In pop music, a way some composers circumevent time constraints on copyright is to co-coprigt songs in the name of your children. Stevie Wonder is the most prominent an example.

John Tranter, for example, knows way more than I know about AUS
rights, and etc.

Coolly for the i-net age, for lit., is that if it was originally
published outside the US, it will or has entered the public domain
long ago.  Plus, if there's a question, why not put it on a foreign
server?  In the days of yore there were some fab english-language
archives on polish servers.

Then there's unpublished outside the US and inside the US.  If we all
lobby really hard, all of the unpublished letters of x to y,  and then
to z, anytime anywhere, even if really in a drawer of a literary
executor (legally) will be public domain in 2011.  The drawer ms. and
cabinet plays! long available to scholars, all, all uploadable.

Since the US laws are so stringent, it has long been safe to assume
that if one can get a, say AUS version, and put it on a AUS server,
aok.

anyone -- backchannel -- I'll be happy to share what I know --


do check my editing notes on HOW2! also see factoryschool and the
University of Pennsylvania archives!

turn blather into books.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have discovered a way to
enlist people across the globe to help digitize books every time they
solve the simple distorted word puzzles commonly used to register at
Web sites or buy things online.

The word puzzles are known as CAPTCHAs, short for "completely
automated public Turing tests to tell computers and humans apart."
Computers can't decipher the twisted letters and numbers, ensuring
that real people and not automated programs are using the Web sites.

Researchers estimate that about 60 million of those nonsensical
jumbles are solved everyday around the world, taking an average of
about 10 seconds each to decipher and type in.

Instead of wasting time typing in random letters and numbers,
Carnegie Mellon researchers have come up with a way for people to
type in snippets of books to put their time to good use, confirm
they're not machines and help speed up the process of getting
searchable texts online.

"Humanity is wasting 150,000 hours every day on these," said Luis von
Ahn, an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon.
He helped develop the CAPTCHAs about seven years ago. "Is there any
way in which we can use this human time for something good for
humanity, do 10 seconds of useful work for humanity?"

Many large projects are under way now to digitize books and put them
online, and that's mostly being done by scanning pages of books so
that people can "page through" the books online. In some cases,
optical character recognition, or OCR, is being used to digitize
books to make the texts searchable.

But von Ahn said OCR doesn't always work on text that is older, faded
or distorted. In those cases, often the only way to digitize the
works is to manually type them into a computer.

Von Ahn is working with the Internet Archive, which runs several book-
scanning projects, to use CAPTCHAs for this instead. Internet Archive
scans 12,000 books a month and sends von Ahn hundreds of thousands of
files that are images that the computer doesn't recognize. Those
files are downloaded onto von Ahn's server and split up into single
words that can be used as CAPTCHAs at sites all over the Internet.

If enough users decipher the CAPTCHAs in the same way, the computer
will recognize that as the correct answer.
"If we can correct these books so that they are really in good shape,
then you can go and use these books in other type devices more
easily" such as handheld computers or in programs for reading to the
blind, said Brewster Kahle, co-founder of the Internet Archive.

Von Ahn approached the Internet Archive to get help in developing the
new system, but it has not been put into use yet. Theoretically, von
Ahn said the new book-based CAPTCHAs could be used in place of any
CAPTCHA currently on the Web.

The project, named reCAPTCHA, is one of many projects that enlist
computer users from the community to help out. For example, Cloudmark
Inc. uses its base of users to judge what is spam and what isn't.
News aggregation sites like Digg Inc.'s digg.com and Time Warner
Inc.'s Netscape.com ask visitors to recommend and vote on items to go
on top.

For von Ahn's project, Intel Corp. donated equipment and the work was
sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation, which awarded von Ahn a
"genius grant" last year.

Kahle, whose Internet Archive has about 200,000 books currently
online, is working with libraries in three countries to digitize
their books. Kahle said von Ahn's project is "harnessing human power
in exactly the right way."

"It's definitely a barn-raising to try to build the great library,"
Kahle said.

"Good Riddance Attention Whore"

by Cindy Sheehan

I have endured a lot of smear and hatred since Casey
was killed and especially since I became the so-called
"Face" of the American anti-war movement. Especially
since I renounced any tie I have remaining with the
Democratic Party, I have been further trashed on such
"liberal blogs" as the Democratic Underground. Being
called an "attention whore" and being told "good
riddance" are some of the more milder rebukes.

I have come to some heartbreaking conclusions this
Memorial Day Morning. These are not spur of the moment
reflections, but things I have been meditating on for
about a year now. The conclusions that I have slowly
and very reluctantly come to are very heartbreaking to
me.

The first conclusion is that I was the darling of the
so-called left as long as I limited my protests to
George Bush and the Republican Party. Of course, I was
slandered and libeled by the right as a "tool" of the
Democratic Party.  This label was to marginalize me and
my message. How could a woman have an original thought,
or be working outside of our "two-party" system?

However, when I started to hold the Democratic Party to
the same standards that I held the Republican Party,
support for my cause started to erode and the "left"
started labeling me with the same slurs that the right
used. I guess no one paid attention to me when I said
that the issue of peace and people dying for no reason
is not a matter of "right or left", but "right and
wrong."

I am deemed a radical because I believe that partisan
politics should be left to the wayside when hundreds of
thousands of people are dying for a war based on lies
that is supported by Democrats and Republican alike. It
amazes me that people who are sharp on the issues and
can zero in like a laser beam on lies,
misrepresentations, and political expediency when it
comes to one party refuse to recognize it in their own
party. Blind party loyalty is dangerous whatever side
it occurs on. People of the world look on us Americans
as jokes because we allow our political leaders so much
murderous latitude and if we don't find alternatives
to this corrupt "two" party system our Representative
Republic will die and be replaced with what we are
rapidly descending into with nary a check or balance: a
fascist corporate wasteland. I am demonized because I
don't see party affiliation or nationality when I
look at a person, I see that person's heart. If
someone looks, dresses, acts, talks and votes like a
Republican, then why do they deserve support just
because he/she calls him/herself a Democrat? I have
also reached the conclusion that if I am doing what I
am doing because I am an "attention whore" then I
really need to be committed. I have invested everything
I have into trying to bring peace with justice to a
country that wants neither. If an individual wants
both, then normally he/she is not willing to do more
than walk in a protest march or sit behind his/her
computer criticizing others. I have spent every
available cent I got from the money a "grateful"
country gave me when they killed my son and every penny
that I have received in speaking or book fees since
then. I have sacrificed a 29 year marriage and have
traveled for extended periods of time away from Casey's
brother and sisters and my health has suffered and my
hospital bills from last summer (when I almost died)
are in collection because I have used all my energy
trying to stop this country from slaughtering innocent
human beings. I have been called every despicable name
that small minds can think of and have had my life
threatened many times.

The most devastating conclusion that I reached this
morning, however, was that Casey did indeed die for
nothing. His precious lifeblood drained out in a
country far away from his family who loves him, killed
by his own country which is beholden to and run by a
war machine that even controls what we think. I have
tried every since he died to make his sacrifice
meaningful. Casey died for a country which cares more
about who will be the next American Idol than how many
people will be killed in the next few months while
Democrats and Republicans play politics with human
lives. It is so painful to me to know that I bought
into this system for so many years and Casey paid the
price for that allegiance. I failed my boy and that
hurts the most.

I have also tried to work within a peace movement that
often puts personal egos above peace and human life.
This group won't work with that group; he won't
attend an event if she is going to be there; and why
does Cindy Sheehan get all the attention anyway? It is
hard to work for peace when the very movement that is
named after it has so many divisions. Our brave young
men and women in Iraq have been abandoned there
indefinitely by their cowardly leaders who move them
around like pawns on a chessboard of destruction and
the people of Iraq have been doomed to death and fates
worse than death by people worried more about elections
than people. However, in five, ten, or fifteen years,
our troops will come limping home in another abject
defeat and ten or twenty years from then, our
children's children will be seeing their loved ones die
for no reason, because their grandparents also bought
into this corrupt system. George Bush will never be
impeached because if the Democrats dig too deeply, they
may unearth a few skeletons in their own graves and the
system will perpetuate itself in perpetuity.

I am going to take whatever I have left and go home. I
am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving
children and try to regain some of what I have lost. I
will try to maintain and nurture some very positive
relationships that I have found in the journey that I
was forced into when Casey died and try to repair some
of the ones that have fallen apart since I began this
single-minded crusade to try and change a paradigm that
is now, I am afraid, carved in immovable, unbendable
and rigidly mendacious marble.

Camp Casey has served its purpose. It's for sale.
Anyone want to buy five beautiful acres in Crawford,
Texas? I will consider any reasonable offer. I hear
George Bush will be moving out soon, too... which makes
the property even more valuable.

This is my resignation letter as the "face" of the
American anti-war movement. This is not my "Checkers"
moment, because I will never give up trying to help
people in the world who are harmed by the empire of the
good old US of A, but I am finished working in, or
outside of this system. This system forcefully resists
being helped and eats up the people who try to help it.
I am getting out before it totally consumes me or
anymore people that I love and the rest of my
resources. Good-bye America ... you are not the country
that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I
sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you
want it.

It's up to you now.

Tell Cindy Sheehan "Thank You"

Dear paul,

We heard this morning that Cindy Sheehan "resigned" as
a leader of the movement for peace in Iraq. I remember
when I first saw Cindy, before she was an international
household name, speaking to an audience at Riverside
Church. She spoke about her son, Casey, and how she
felt that she was in part personally responsible for
his death because she hadn't spoken out against the
war. I saved this video of it
<http://www.truemajority.org/TM_Cindy.mov>,
and everyone I've shown it to has been strongly moved.

TrueMajority members were there at the beginning of
Cindy's public journey, donating money and hiring
organizers to support her 2004 vigil outside the
President's ranch in Crawford, and the national bus
tour that followed. Now that the journey seems to have
reached an end, we thought it would be nice to send her
a simple "Thank you" for all the work and sacrifice
Cindy Sheehan has offered to this movement.

http://act.truemajority.org/o/1/t/3/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=3D7

Like other activist leaders who become well-known,
Cindy was critiqued and criticized from one side and
the other for some of the things she said and some of
the ways she chose to protest. It was easy to forget
that while she became a symbol to many on both sides of
the Iraq War debate, she was really always that same
grieving mother.

In Peace,

Matt Holland
TrueMajority Online Director

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Here's the 'Thank You' note we'll send to Cindy
Sheehan:

Dear Cindy,

We are deeply saddened by your announcement to retire
from the peace movement, but understand and respect
your decision. You have been an inspiration to hundreds
of thousands of people and have our deepest and most
sincere gratitude.

We, as TrueMajority members, have supported you and
your hard work from the very beginning -- attending
marches and rallies, donating time and money and
calling on our government time and time again to end
this deadly war and bring our troops home.

We promise to work even harder to end this war and
bring our men and women home safely. We thank you for
your years of hard work and sacrifice and wish you and
your family the very best.

In Peace,

TrueMajority

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Today Cindy Sheehan "retired" from the anti-war
movement after leading the fight for two years with
every piece of her heart and soul.

Cindy wrote: "Good-bye America=E2=80=A6 you are not the country
that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I
sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you
want it. It's up to you now."

Sadly, America needs Cindy more than ever. Eight more
Casey Sheehans died today in Iraq, leaving eight more
grieving Cindy Sheehans back home. Sgt. David Safstrom
of the 82nd Airborne told the NY Times, "What are we
doing here? Why are we still here? We're helping guys
that are trying to kill us. We help them in the day.
They turn around at night and try to kill us."

Cindy lost heart after a few dozen "Bush Democrats"
voted with virtually every Republican to keep Bush's
criminal occupation going forever.

And it's easy to lose heart when we put our time and
money into electing anti-war Democratic majorities,
only to have those majorities betrayed by a few dozen
"Bush Democrats" who are bribed by powerful defense
contractors or intimidated by Karl Rove's political
henchmen.

But we cannot afford to lose heart because May's total
deaths of U.S. troops hit 114, the highest since Cindy
began her anti-war campaign and the third highest of
the war. And at the current monthly rate, 2007 will be
the deadliest year for U.S. troops in the four years of
Bush's criminal occupation.

So all of us must pick up the torch that Cindy laid
down and find a way to end this war. But how?

In May, 169 House Democrats voted for the McGovern
Amendment to end the occupation in March 2008, while
only 59 "Bush Democrats" voted against it. If we can
switch 43 of those 59 "Bush Democrats," the McGovern
Amendment will pass. So let's recruit anti-war
Democrats to run against those 59 "Bush Democrats" in
the 2008 primaries.

This strategy produced dramatic results in 2006. Both
Jane Harman (CA-36) and Al Wynn (MD-4) voted for the
war in 2002, but voted against the occupation in 2007
as a direct result of primary challenges by outstanding
anti-war candidates Marcy Winograd and Donna Edwards.
(Edwards lost by only 3% and will run again in 2008.)

So let's find challengers for all 59 "Bush Democrats"!
We created a map of all 59 "Bush Democrat" districts
here:
http://tinyurl.com/2hl9vz

Click the pins to see the incumbent's name and a link
to a page for that incumbent. If you know an anti-war
candidate who could run a good race, click that link
and nominate that candidate in a comment. Also share
your thoughts on other nominees you find there.

We also created an online pledge form to start building
support for our anti-war challengers:

"I pledge to vote against every Senator and
Representative who approves funding to continue the
disastrous Iraq War. We have already given far too much
of our blood and treasure - and killed far too many
Iraqis - for a war based on lies. We are now occupying
a hostile nation divided by civil war for the benefit
of military contractors and Big Oil.

The only way to support our troops is to bring them
home NOW, and no funds should be used for any other
purpose. If Congress fails to bring our troops home, I
will do everything I can - and urge everyone I know -
to defeat pro-war Senators and Representatives, both in
my party's primary elections and in the November
general election."

Over 18,000 have already signed our pledge. Sign it now
and tell your friends:
http://www.democrats.com/iraq-vote-pledge

Let's do it for Cindy Sheehan - and for her beloved son
Casey.

In theory all the information regarding copyright should be here:
http://www.copyright.gov/

As for copyleft, there's a site for that, too:  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/

There's even one for copywrong:  http://www.copywrong.info/

I find the non-governmental sites much more interesting, and probably more
useful to a poet.

One of the best sites for online avatar / Second Life work is on Odyssey;
Sugar Seville has opened a space on Ning (similar to Facebook) for
discussion and presentation. Among other people, Gaz and I have work there
- it's at http://odysseyart.ning.com/video . Ning is better than Youtube
in terms of video quality (although not audience numbers). I've been
largely disappointed in my own work on Youtube in this regard. In any
case, check Ning out, if not Odyssey itself on Second Life.



Stem

"I think this deserves another look. I think this deserves a look-see."
http://www.asondheim.org/stem.mp4 she said. She wandered around the space,
as Ballard said, like a mad madonna; she left trails of skin, kindred
tissue, organelles. Ballard added that one might construct a bridge of DNA
although for what purpose it was hard to say; raveled strands rarely ad-
hered in plank- or vector-formation. But the primitives stretched between
nodes, positions, states, syzygies; it took all that computation, they
said, to make a stem. The lingam in the Siva Purana; no one could measure
it, get to the bottom of it, just as no one could get to the bottom of
this avatar riding herself or the invisibility of the world. She said she
saw nothing. She said she felt it just the same.

Maybe let's divide into two listservs, one consisting of all those who would rather have counted among their friends Dr. William Carlos Williams, Dr. Anton Chekhov, or even Dr. Louis-Ferdinand Celine...and the other consisting of all those who would rather have counted Ed Dorn a friend in preference to any or all of the aforementioned.

Hi all --

A midweek update to rhubarb is susan, with three things, the largest being
a review of Bill Allegrezza and Ray Bianchi's _City Visible_, their
anthology of Chicago poets. You can find that at

MiPOesias Magazine seeks submissions from Cuban-American poets for an upcoming special edition. The publication is scheduled to launch online in the Spring of 2008.  Writers living anywhere in the U.S. are encouraged to submit 5-7 poems to mipoesias@earthlink.net . We are interested in contemporary, well-crafted verse that reflects today's hyphen-American culture and concerns. We seek modern voices with fresh perspectives. Please, no poems about palm trees and mangos and nostalgia for the island. Deadline for submissions is November 15.  Emma Trelles, a South Florida native and arts writer for the Sun-Sentinel, is editing this special edition of MiPOesias Magazine. Again, please note that this call for poetry is open only to Cuban-American writers living in the U.S.A. We are not accepting poems written exclusively in Spanish. We will consider Spanglish or dicharachos within the poem's content. MiPOesias Magazine Publications have been recognized by Best American Poetry and
 the Pushcart Prize. For more information about MiPOesias and its projects and publications, visit us online www.mipoesias.com

It's "The Sociology of Art," in "talking at the boundaries," p157.
You should also look at the Antin issue of The Review of Contemporary
Fiction, Spring, 2001.  Lou

what you think and feel about art is as important as what anyone else thinks
and feels about art.

this is the saving grace and the social dysfunction of art.

art is the one and only republic of anarchy.

There is/was no Dr Louis-Ferdinand Celine.  He practiced medecine under his=
 birth name,  Destouches. Celine is a  nom de plume, from his mother's side=
 of the family. Biographers and critics of Celine/Destouches' work/life oft=
en note the differences between the writings and interviews of Celine and t=
he actions of Dr Destouches. (A weird form of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde?)      Do=
 not forget the great Dr Rabelais!!  Who knew and prescribed "Laughter is t=
he best medecine"!       Actually a great many poets in statements, intervi=
ews, works, letters and so forth--will assert at some point a sense of iden=
tity as poet or poet of a particular school or background or group etc--via=
 a diferentiation based on a contempt or intolerance for some other poets, =
 group--the bourgeoisie, usually--or "rival' groups of poets--etc--class of=

awyers--well you have always the right to a lawyer, and if you can't afford=
 one, one will be provided for you. You see, he left himself an out so to s=

Subject:      something small, with Hs
Comments: To: announce <announce@logolalia.com>

The first time I read that bpNichol had a favorite letter of the
alphabet I was sufficiently steeped in his work that I wasn't really
surprised, but, it did strike me. I ran quickly through the alphabet
in my head and tried to decide if I had one. I didn't, but, I couldn't
rule out the possibility that I could have a favorite.

The idea of a favorite letter struck me more than the fact of the
specific letter--though there is much to be said for H as a favorite
(his own stated reasons included some very strong and early
connections).

Over time, in no planned or constant fashion, I've taken advantage of
a few opportunities to connect back with H, some more notable than
others. One example (from many):

On a trip to New York City we found ourselves in a street fair, one of
the vendors was selling baseball caps. Off to the side, tucked back in
a corner, away from the official teams was a series of caps that just
had individual letters of the alphabet on them, and H was right at my
eye level as we walked by. How could I pass that up?  So I bought the
hat, and would wear it from time to time. Sometimes people would ask
me "What does the H stand for?" And I'd reply variously with Hello,
Hi, Howyadoin, Heythere, Happy, Hotdamn, or Hoodoggy. More often than
not, this became a conversation starter and I'd get the chance to tell
the real story and end up in a talk about bpNichol and his work and
how it affected me and my work.

I've been camera-in-hand for a couple of months now because of an
unrelated project, and I've taken advantage of that by hunting for Hs
in the wild, and taking pictures of them.

So I had this accumulated group of Hs, and even without any
intentional plans to continue adding to the group (which I do have),
it became clear that it was time to give these Hs a proper home. I'd
put some up on flickr.com for a while, but have lately become
disenchanted with them as a service, ever since they were bought out
by Yahoo! and made some changes to the way they operate that rub me
the wrong way.

After a frustrating day of hunting for a canned solution that met all
or most of my needs, I decided it was time to call in the experts. I
contacted Marko Niemi, described to him what I wanted (a grid in the
shape of an H that would randomly cycle through all of the images in a
directory on a webserver that I could just upload images into), and
asked him if that was something simple or difficult--it's a minor and
obscure project, and I didn't want to waste his time on it if it was
one of those things that's really easy to describe and really
difficult to implement.  Within hours with only a couple of back and
forths, it was completely finished.

Reason #378 why I love collaborating with Marko Niemi: only AFTER
everything was completely finished and ready to launch did Marko ask
me, "Btw, is there a particular reason for the obsession with the
letter H?" Create first, ask questions later.

I am pleased to offer for your ongoing use, "Hs for bpNichol", a piece
that will continue to grow and shift and change as Hs drift in,
through, and out of my life.

Maybe, with a little consensus, Dr. Feelgood could minister to both groups,
as well as the rest of us!

Are there any known poet women Doctors (medical) to add to the list??
Early in the morning and cold, foggy here and I am not thinking/remembering
too quickly.

Dear Small Press Traffic Community,

I want to let you know that our website is finally sleeked up for the
late 00s, with more new content to arrive in the coming months. Check
it out: http://www.sptraffic.org.

Also, we have a new email, the one I am writing to you from now. Please note.

As many of you know, I will be taking an extended (unpaid) maternity
leave/sabbatical for 07-08. I am grateful to the SPT board for
allowing me this.

Please join me in welcoming poet, educator, and former SPT board
member Dana Teen Lomax, who will serve as Interim Director beginning
July 1. Dana is a charming and smart person, has extensive experience
in curating, fundraising, and nonprofit arts administration, and I am
very confident that she will do a fantastic job.

One great way to welcome Dana would be to renew or establish a
membership at SPT. Details are on the membership page of our website.
Please remember that although we are housed rent-free (thank heavens)
at the California College of the Arts, we do remain autonomous and
thus dependent upon outside funding for all of our operating expenses.

Finally, FYI, our office is closed in June this year.

My warm regards to you all --
Elizabeth

As for my irritation on Spicer's "faggot-poetry" term for Ginsberg,
just wanted to say that I've been thinking about it, and reading the
various ideas about it here, and I'm thinking now that I was probably
wrong.

Too many things I brought to its definition which may not be relevant
to Spicer, his ideas, or his intentions.

George, you're still my favorite grumpy old man of all time!

ANNOUNCING A NEW WRITING WORKSHOP

The Art of Finding & Telling Stories
an 8-week fiction writing workshop with
Neelanjana Banerjee
offered by Kearny Street Workshop

JUNE 18 - AUGUST 2007
Mondays, 7 - 9.45PM
Public reading & chapbook release of students'
work
180 Capp Street (@17th street ), San Francisco

Class size: minimum of 6, maximum of 14.
Cost: $215 regular, $195 for KSW members.

Register by check or credit card, contact
artistic director Samantha
Chanse at 415.503.0520 or sam@kearnystreet.org
for more information.
Registration info below.

Class Description:
Our worlds are thick with layers and layers of
untold stories. Perhaps
you remember a story your grandmother used to
tell you, or overhear
two little girls fighting on the bus, or even
witness a particularly
violent rainstorm – each of these moments could
be the seed for a
story. The art of fiction comes from both
learning how to access these
stories and figuring out the best way to tell
them.

In this class we are going to be scavenging the
world around us, and
within us, for material. We will be observing,
eavesdropping,
researching and much more in order to take
advantage of the abundance
of details in our lives. Along with this directed

exploring, the class
will also focus on investigating the ways in
which we can manipulate
narrative and transform subjects through language

and form.

We will study the craft of storytelling and
fiction writing by
interacting with a broad range of texts that will

include short
stories, non-fiction, poetry and multimedia
examples. We will get our
hands dirty with both in-class and take-home
writing exercises,
practicing various ways to tell our stories. We
will share our work
often and discuss each other's stories in a
workshop. By the end of
the class, students will have a rough draft of a
short story and lots
of great ideas for other ones. Note: This class
is intended for all
levels.

About the Instructor:
Neelanjana Banerjee has worked as a journalist
for the last seven
years. The former editor-in-chief of AsianWeek
newspaper, she
currently works as the managing editor of YO!
Youth Outlook
Multimedia, where she helps young people produce
their own media. A
regular contributor to Audrey Magazine, she is
also contributing
editor for Hyphen magazine. Currently in her
final year of the MFA
program in fiction at San Francisco State
University, her writing has
appeared in the Asian Pacific American Journal, A

Room of One's Own,
Suspect Thoughts and the anthology Desilicious
(Arsenal Press).

Happy Birthday indeed, Walt Whitman.  I have had more than an hour of joy in my life, however.  Meditation and the bliss which sometimes comes from great art (all the arts) I'm talking about here.  Still, in spite of all the bad news we read or hear everyday, there is still the truly great and original Leaves of Grass to inspire us all and help keep us going through the mire.  I'm happy to say I've been aware of Walt Whitman all my life.  My parents had an "original copy" of the famous etching/lithograph which used to be on all the covers of paperback Whitmans years ago.  I have it now above my bed and have had it there since my parents passed on.  So indeed, happy birthday Walt, both to your words and your image.  Regards, Tom Savage

Meditation and the bliss which sometimes comes from great art (all the arts) I'm talking about here.  Still, in spite of all the bad news we read or hear everyday, there is still the truly great and original Leaves of Grass to inspire us all and help keep us going through the mire.  I'm happy to say I've been aware of Walt Whitman all my life.  My parents had an "original copy" of the famous etching/lithograph which used to be on all the covers of paperback Whitmans years ago.  I have it now above my bed and have had it there since my parents passed on.  So indeed, happy birthday Walt, both to your words and your image.  Regards, Tom Savage

Seven Pieces of Resurrection


The following works are produced from materials 2006-2007; they include
dancework/choreography (Maud Liardon, Foofwa d'Imobilite), dance
description (Gerald Jones, a kind of memorial), a modified harmonica solo
(Alan Sondheim), and a story worth seeing, "Long Long Run." I usually
don't work at this speed or present so much material at once, but these
pieces are all of interest. If you have limited time, I'd look at Long
Long Run, Frenzy, and Blues and Blues. And all for Gerald in Memoriam.

Thanks for sharing a great story.

Subject: something small, with Hs

The first time I read that bpNichol had a favorite letter of the
alphabet I was sufficiently steeped in his work that I wasn't really
surprised, but, it did strike me. I ran quickly through the alphabet
in my head and tried to decide if I had one. I didn't, but, I couldn't
rule out the possibility that I could have a favorite.

The idea of a favorite letter struck me more than the fact of the
specific letter--though there is much to be said for H as a favorite
(his own stated reasons included some very strong and early
connections).

Over time, in no planned or constant fashion, I've taken advantage of
a few opportunities to connect back with H, some more notable than
others. One example (from many):

On a trip to New York City we found ourselves in a street fair, one of
the vendors was selling baseball caps. Off to the side, tucked back in
a corner, away from the official teams was a series of caps that just
had individual letters of the alphabet on them, and H was right at my
eye level as we walked by. How could I pass that up?  So I bought the
hat, and would wear it from time to time. Sometimes people would ask
me "What does the H stand for?" And I'd reply variously with Hello,
Hi, Howyadoin, Heythere, Happy, Hotdamn, or Hoodoggy. More often than
not, this became a conversation starter and I'd get the chance to tell
the real story and end up in a talk about bpNichol and his work and
how it affected me and my work.

I've been camera-in-hand for a couple of months now because of an
unrelated project, and I've taken advantage of that by hunting for Hs
in the wild, and taking pictures of them.

So I had this accumulated group of Hs, and even without any
intentional plans to continue adding to the group (which I do have),
it became clear that it was time to give these Hs a proper home. I'd
put some up on flickr.com for a while, but have lately become
disenchanted with them as a service, ever since they were bought out
by Yahoo! and made some changes to the way they operate that rub me
the wrong way.

After a frustrating day of hunting for a canned solution that met all
or most of my needs, I decided it was time to call in the experts. I
contacted Marko Niemi, described to him what I wanted (a grid in the
shape of an H that would randomly cycle through all of the images in a
directory on a webserver that I could just upload images into), and
asked him if that was something simple or difficult--it's a minor and
obscure project, and I didn't want to waste his time on it if it was
one of those things that's really easy to describe and really
difficult to implement.  Within hours with only a couple of back and
forths, it was completely finished.

Reason #378 why I love collaborating with Marko Niemi: only AFTER
everything was completely finished and ready to launch did Marko ask
me, "Btw, is there a particular reason for the obsession with the
letter H?" Create first, ask questions later.

I am pleased to offer for your ongoing use, "Hs for bpNichol", a piece
that will continue to grow and shift and change as Hs drift in,
through, and out of my life.

Enjoy,

Dear Listlings:
I got the following msg from someone who works in the Math Dept,
adjacent to my dept at UMN: he's translated what looks like a v
charming and interesting book by Ernesto Sabato (see description
below). Now he is interested in publication possibilities.  He is
cc'd on the msg above, so those of you who want to read the ms or
have any other interest in the project shd contact him (Carl Toews)
directly.

I'm looking for the source of these Stein lines:

MRS. MISSES KISSES MRS. MOST MRS.
MISSES KISSES MISSES KISSES
MOST.

The line breaks are likely wrong (I'm guessing it was one "sentence"
in the original).  And it may be followed by "And the twelfth."

Any leads would be greatly appreciated.
