Gabriel: We keep the Pavement Saw Press contest entirely anonymous.
All of the manuscripts are stripped of name address phone & publication
credits and receive a number which is written on the envelope &
manuscript. The top 25 are chosen by two readers other than the judge
(except last year when everyone bailed). These are then mailed.

None of the three winners so far has had a full length book out
beforehand. The last chapbook only had two previously published poems.
None of the winners had a poem previously published in our journal. None
of the judges knew the winners. Josh McKinney could attest to this, he
is lurking here somewhere.

This says a lot to me about who would win if other contests were done
this way.  It also tells me that presses who aren't  selecting a
manuscript are committing egregious blaspheme.

As for scandal, I need an anonymous e-mail address for ones which
haven't seen print.
There also is a whole other side to this situation which involves a
shift in editorial policy that benefits University contests and a few
others which is real ugly. I haven't seen any words mentioning this
yet.

Be well

Dress in a manner customary for women? Most of the women I know dress in a
manner that was once customary for men. What the heck do I do now?

Apologies for blaring my own trumpet a bit loudly but, for anyone who =
might be interested, here's a review of my chapbook Syzygy which just =
appeared in The Irish Review (once more published by Cork University =
Press).

There's an added satisfaction in this, since the redoubtable Edna =
Longley has long been bouncer at this particular door, admitting only =
those wearing a button reading "War Poet of Northern Ireland", or =
genuflecting to the Heaney shrine tastefully placed just at the =
entrance. She's still on the editorial board, but it seems her veto's =
gone.

(For her deeply pondered and astonishingly subtle view of "traditions =
of Irish modernisms other than the Yeats line" see Keith Tuma's note =
at    http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/documents/anglo.html)

Incidentally, I believe the book is also available through Peter =
Riley's distribution service in England. (Email:  priley@dircon.co.uk)

Purity and Dirt

Alex Davis

Trevor Joyce, Syzygy.  Bray: Wild Honey Press, 1998, distributed by =
Hardpressed Poetry, 37 Grosvenor Court, Templeville Rd., Templeogue, =
Dublin 6W,   (Phone (353) 21 456 3112).  Ir =A33.50.

One useful point of entry into Trevor Joyce=B9s challenging new =
sequence, Syzygy, is "Chimera," from his 1995 collection stone =
floods.  The polyphonic "Chimaera" conjoins dialogically Richard =
Lovelace=B9s self-satisfied, urbane wit, Aloysius Bertrand=B9s =
apocalyptic forebodings of the levelling of all bounds, and the Book =
of Lieh Tze=B9s acceptance of the provisionality of limits in nature, =
the fragility of the ego and the interconnected diversity of the =
phenomenal world.  While Lovelace=B9s verbal ingenuity and =
Bertrand=B9s nausea are aspects of Joyce=B9s writing from Pentahedron =
(1972) on, it is the concerns of the Book of Lieh Tze which chime =
most fully with those of his recent poetry, including Syzygy.  =
Furthermore, the complex structure of the two interlaced parts of =
Syzygy recalls even as it excels the earlier poem=B9s utilisation of =
the Japanese renga form, the latter employing, in the words of =
Joyce=B9s note to the poem, "systematic ambiguity to chain together a =
series of brief stanzas every one of which hinges both forward and =
backward."  In the case of Syzygy, systematic ambiguity derives, not =
from a literary precedent, but from the method of composition =
described in Joyce=B9s annotations to the sequence.  In brief, the =
"palindromic net," as Joyce felicitously terms it, is achieved by =
means of a base text, now fossilised in the second part of the =
sequence, that dictates the opening and closing segments of each of =
the twelve units or "cells" of part I.  Once those cells are =
complete, their material, mediated through the controlling =
procedures, determines the remainder of part II.  Space prevents a =
more elaborate exposition of the text=B9s structure: the interested =
reader can consult Joyce=B9s notes for a detailed commentary.  Of =
greater importance, I feel, are the implications of this method of =
composition for our response to and evaluation of this text.  Its =
formal discipline lies in the manner in which the originating lines =
prescribe, to an extent, the remainder of the text.  This approach, =
of course, is not unique to Joyce: John Cage=B9s famous mesostic =
texts, his "writing through" of others=B9 works, are generated in a =
not unrelated fashion to Syzygy.  Even in the context of recent Irish =
poetry such avant-gardism finds a few--though only a few--parallels: =
Randolph Healy=B9s Flame (1997), also published by Wild Honey Press, =
is likewise constructed using chance procedures.  In Joyce=B9s case, =
the partially prescripted nature of the sequence is at one with =
Joyce=B9s recurrent preoccupation, from Pentahedron to stone floods, =
with bounds, order and, crucially, with their breakdown and =
transgression.  For, as Joyce=B9s notes confess, the symmetry of the =
sequence is not absolute, there is a tiny flaw in the crystalline =
structure; and it is precisely this alloyment that brings the formal =
qualities of Syzygy into alignment with its thematic concern: the =
relationship between conceptual order and the particularity of the =
phenomenal world.  In a manner reminiscent of Adorno, the text views =
the former as necessary and inescapable, but stifling and ineluctably =
involved with other, harsher kinds of domination:

when the thieving
that was well advanced faltered
the imperial presence surveyed
the ordered territories
and declared in measured words
nothing there is savage any more
intelligence and griefs are tamed
rage is reduced in parks
only perhaps along the furthest bounds
may be some dirt a little ghost
and these are even as we speak contained
in three quart jugs

In these lines, Joyce brings together, with strikingly evocative =
concision, colonial subjugation of land (in China and Ireland) =
through force and cartography; a suppressive coercion that is closely =
bound up with human discourse, the "measured words" "we speak."  Such =
subjection involves rejection, of the "dirt" or debris that refuses =
to conform to the purifying new order.  As Joyce acknowledges, this =
dimension of the poem draws on the ideas of Mary Douglas, whose =
Purity and Danger atomises the need purity has to reduce that which =
it spurns to the non-threatening condition of rubbish, whether that =
be conceptual or human detritus.
        Along related lines, a chief preoccupation of the poem is the manner =
in which lived experiential time is abstracted to clock time, the =
latter marshalling the former into "garrisons brief zones / of time =
and influence":

until the fixed mesh abstracts
unerringly each hour
with all its clamouring brood
jerking routinely to the tune

Yet the "clamouring" of reality resists the taxonomic mesh due to its =
messy particularity, just as one=B9s lifeworld defies total =
systematisation.  Joyce conveys the resistance of dirt, in =
Douglas=B9s extended sense, to purification through densely punning =
lines, the ambiguities of which themselves emphasise the fluidity of =
a supposedly classified, demarcated and regimented world:

noise of concerns sequestered
ultimately will get out
states sundered bleed
surely each to each
by breaking bounds ghosts
traffic through the empty squares

Indeed, the very title word of Joyce=B9s text is ambivalent, =
trafficking between two senses.  Among its meanings, syzygy, in =
astronomy, can signify either the conjunction or opposition of two =
heavenly bodies.  The strength of this remarkable poem lies in its =
syzygetic nature; its close correlation of form to a content =
preoccupied with the opposition that matter, of various kinds, puts =
up to structuration.  (That the word, in prosody, further denotes the =
admixture of two feet in one metre is also of relevance to the =
intertwined patterning of the poem=B9s two parts.)  In these =
respects, while Syzygy clearly grows out of Joyce=B9s last =
collection, stone floods, it breaks new ground in the compelling =
intricacy and moving urgency of its formalism.

The Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses
by Alan Charles Kors, Harvey A. Silverglate
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684853213/darwinanddarwini/

At first glance, this title is just another entry in the roster of
books opposed to political correctness at American universities, yet
it's surprisingly good--certainly the best of its type since Dinesh
D'Souza's Illiberal Education appeared in 1991. Kors and Silverglate
are hard-core civil libertarians turned off by the "hidden,
systematic assault upon liberty, individualism, dignity, due process,
and equality before the law" that they describe as rampant on
campuses. Theirs is not so much a brief against academic
multiculturalism, but an eye-opening narrative about how the modern
university "hands students a moral agenda upon arrival, subjects them
to mandatory political reeducation, sends them to sensitivity
training, submerges their individuality in official group identity,
intrudes upon private conscience, treats them with scandalous
inequality, and, when it chooses, suspends or expels them." Through
well-told stories and anecdotes (including an excellent chapter-long
sketch of the University of Pennsylvania's semi-famous "water
buffalo" incident), Kors and Silverglate make their case and make it
well. --John J. Miller

From Booklist , September 1, 1998
Even chemistry majors are learning politics at American universities
these days. But the type of politics they are learning does not
impress Kors and Silverglate, since it entails the establishment of a
left-leaning political orthodoxy and the systematic suppression of
dissent. The authors document in alarming detail the Orwellian
techniques universities now use to enforce conformity--vague and
self-contradictory speech codes; secretive and arbitrary disciplinary
proceedings; ideological indoctrination billed as sensitivity
training; censorship of conservative publications and speakers.
Besides shaking readers out of their complacency, the tales of abuse
lend urgency to their call for renewed openness on college campuses.
Only such openness, the authors warn, can restore the First Amendment
rights lost to students and professors under the thumb of groupthink
inquisitors. And because of the university's culture-shaping power,
all of society stands at risk unless such rights are restored.
Fortunately, the authors conclude their sobering diagnosis with a
promising prescription of practical policies for academics committed
to safeguarding campus liberties. So long as campus zealots wage war
against independent thought, librarians will see strong demand for
this book. Bryce Christensen

From Kirkus Reviews , September 1, 1998
Two civil libertarians take up the cudgels against political
correctness in speech codes at American colleges and universities.
Kors is a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania who
represented a student - charged with shouting the epithet - water
buffalo - at members of a black sorority having a rowdy party in a
dormitory courtyard - in his intramural battle with the university.
And Silverglate is a civil liberties litigator and legal columnist
from Massachusetts. They take the egregious ``Water Buffalo Affair''
of 1993 as the jumping-off point for a wide-ranging, detailed, and
legally informed study of how universities and colleges supposedly
ride roughshod over First Amendment rights in the interest of curbing
hate speech. Their study, while often stimulating and revealing,
undermines its own credibility with hysterical rhetoric:
``Universities have become the enemy of a free society, and it is
time for the citizens of that society to recognize this scandal of
enormous proportions and hold these institutions to account.'' How
did we come to this desperate pass? ``Whole departments of the
liberal arts have been given to those for whom the universities
represent, in their own minds, the revolutionary agency of culture.''
Kors and Silverglate round up the usual suspects, but the late
Herbert Marcuse - icon of the 1960s New Left - comes in for a special
drubbing. With grudging admiration, they propose that his views on
the limiting of free speech paved the way for Richard Delgado,
Charles R. Lawrence III, Mari Matsuda, Catharine MacKinnon, and
Stanley Fish, all of whom wish to curtail free speech in the interest
of race and gender equality. The authors put academic freedom in
historical perspective and offer illuminating observations about
double standards and about the universities' relationship to the
courts, but the exaggeratedly polemical posturing undermines the
reader's confidence in their objectivity. While in many ways a fine
and learned study, Kors and Silverglate's hellfire-and-brimstone
sermon will likely be heeded only by the saved. -- Copyright ©1998,

Book Description

Universities once believed themselves to be sacred enclaves, where
students and professors could debate the issues of the day and arrive
at a better understanding of the human condition. Today, sadly, this
ideal of the university is being quietly betrayed from within.
Universities still set themselves apart from American society, but
now they do so by enforcing their own politically correct worldview
through censorship, double standards, and a judicial system without
due process. Faculty and students who threaten the prevailing norms
may be forced to undergo "thought reform." In a surreptitious
aboutface, universities have become the enemy of a free society, and
the time has come to hold these institutions to account.

The Shadow University is a stinging indictment of the covert system
of justice on college campuses, exposing the widespread reliance on
kangaroo courts and arbitrary punishment to coerce students and
faculty into conformity. Alan Charles Kors and Harvey A. Silverglate,
staunch civil libertarians and active defenders of free inquiry on
campus, lay bare the totalitarian mindset that undergirds speech
codes, conduct codes, and "campus life" bureaucracies, through which
a cadre of deans and counselors indoctrinate students and faculty in
an ideology that favors group rights over individual rights,
sacrificing free speech and academic freedom to spare the
sensitivities of currently favored groups.

From Maine to California, at public and private universities alike,
liberty and fairness are the first casualties as teachers and
students find themselves in the dock, presumed guilty until proven
innocent and often forbidden to cross-examine their accusers. Kors
and Silverglate introduce us to many of those who have firsthand
experience of the shadow university, including:

The student at the center of the 1993 "Water Buffalo" case at the
University of Pennsylvania, who was brought up on charges of racial
harassment after calling a group of rowdy students "water buffalo" --
even though the term has no racial connotations.

The Catholic residence adviser who was fired for refusing, on grounds
of religious conscience, to wear a symbol of gay and lesbian causes.

The professor who was investigated for sexual harassment when he
disagreed with campus feminists about curriculum issues.

The student who was punished for laughing at a statement deemed
offensive to others and who was ordered to undergo "sensitivity
training" as a result.

The Shadow University unmasks a chilling reality for parents who
entrust their sons and daughters to the authority of such
institutions, for thinking people who recognize that vigorous debate
is the only sure path to truth, and for all Americans who realize
that when even one citizen is deprived of liberty, we are all
diminished.

The author, Harvey A. Silverglate <has@world.std.com> , July 12, 1998
At the end of the 20th century, something profoundly disturbing is
happening to higher education in America. Universities now enforce a
politically correct agenda through censorship, double standards, and
kangaroo courts. Faculty and students who dissent from the new
orthodoxy are stripped of their civil liberties, some even forced to
undergo intrusive and partisan "sensitivity training." Universities
have become the enemy of a free society. This book is a stinging
indictment and exposure of injustices and coerced conformity on
college campuses. The book explains the utopian and totalitarian
ideology underlying the new speech and behavioral codes, a worldview
that favors group over individual rights and that would sacrifice
freedom and equality before the law on behalf of its political goals.
The book also offers a legal, strategic, and moral blueprint for
restoring liberty at our colleges and universities. The book exposes
a state of affairs that will shock anyone who considers free speech,
equal justice under law, respect for conscience, and fairness to be
at once the foundations and bulwark of American liberty.

these defenses of poetry directly take up plato's challenge in is it
republic 13, where he throws poetry out of the republic but says, if anyone
wants to write a defense of poetry, which we all of course love, we'd be
happy to reconsider.

9 (b). Write a book of poetry using the same exact words as another. Use
all of them as many times as the original. Really don't cheat, don't
tell anyone what you've done. (I've thought to do this for year, with
Paterson, would probably take years.)

While I was in New York with Suspended Music, I received a great new book
from Drogue, "Roots of the Moment" by Pauline Oliveros.

It's a book of her poetics of composing & performing meditative musical
works, but it has a tremendous relevance to the work of many of the writers
I know of on this list. The book also looks great, with typography & design
by Blair Seagram (is Blair still on this list).  It's relatively expensive
for a paperback, $35, but it includes a very good CD of several text-based
horspiels (radio plays) along with the book. It was drop-shipped from the
press, so the copies were literally the first available, but SPD will have
it, if they don't already.

Also, last spring, I think it was, the music of Phill Niblock came up here
on the list.  It was pretty clear that at least some people hadn't heard
it, & didn't understand the problems of audience reception of the work.
Now any of you who have RealAudio on your computer can hear it. I have a
piece of his for eight tracks of trombones, programmed on Mappings, my show
at Antenna Radio, this week (it'll be available from the Mappings archive
page for a week after Saturday).  The front page for Antenna is

it IS good to have Elilza back. And I agree about contests, too.

But up here in Canada they are a great way to raise money for magazines (&
get subscribers). And so may poets love them. Even if they ARE all equally
good in different ways (& maybe they are!)

But you're right about rleations between judges & winners. I like your
morality on that one...

Baseball fans on the list with know that Dan Quisenberry died yestrday.  A
great relief pitcher on the KC Royals when they were champs.  His wierd,
loopy side arm fireballs matched his personality.  Others may not know he
was a poet.  He had published two books "Down and In" and "On Days Like This"
available through The Writers Place, 3737 Penna. , Kansas City, MO.  He
was quite active in the KC poetry scene and spent many hours in local library
reading poetry of all kinds to school kids.  A good guy.

MERRILL COVE by Paul Metcalf
Written in the late 1950s, while Metcalf resided in North Carolina, _Merrill
Cove_, as remained unpublished until now. "We lived there for four years, and
it was a significant period of our lives: the way of life, the writing, the
warm associations with Charles Olson, Jonathan Williams, Black Mountain
College. The Cove is what I think of when I think of North Carolina."

THE ARANEA CONSTELLATION
by Clayton Eshleman
A stunning prose poem/essay, "The Aranea Constellation" is a newly completed
section from Eshleman's 24-year work-in-progress, _Juniper Fuse: Paleolithic
Imagination & the Construction of the Underworld_. Exploring the relevance of
Upper Paleolithic cave imagery to 20th century crises, Eshleman here attempts
to situate poetry in its oldest and deepest context.

28 pp. saddle-stiched. Editions limited to 300 copies. Send $5 each (plus $1.50

As long as this subject has come up again, I'd really like to know how much
money the various prizes take in in entry fees. If a prize-granting agency,
whether press or honorary society, has to pay for outside judges I suppose
it's alright to raise money from fees to offset the cost. I'm not sure it's
ok to ask applicants to pay for the printing of someone else's book. And I
am sure that it's not ok for a prize-grantor to make a profit on the process.

There has been an enormous proliferation of fee-for-entrance prizes in the
past decade. In theory there's nothing to keep any press from converting
its entire manuscript submission and reading process to a series of
contests--it would probably pay better than marketing the books. But
judging and acquiring manuscripts and taking the risk of meeting expenses
is what presses are supposed to do. And the cost of multiple contest entry,
surely a form of extortion, has to be onorous for most poets, added, as it
is, to the already hefty expense involved in becoming and remaining a poet.

For the record, I've never paid to enter a contest because of my feelings
about the ethics of the process.

But Mark, this is so tricky. And no, I haven't entered contests, and Chax
Press doesn't plan to hold one. But, how do you judge "the cost," if you
say it's OK to pay for that. Do you pay the contest readers, and do you pay
them a decent wage of $25 per hour or more? And if the people running the
press are the readers, then what if they decide to put that money into the
production of the book rather than into their pockets? How do you decide
what's profit -- is that after salaries/fees/overhead/etc. are deducted?

That said, I agree about the proliferation of fee-based contests. But I
also think that if a press wants to sponsor a contest and wants the fees
from the contest to pay for the publication of a book, that's fine -- as
long as the process of the competition is fair. As to "judging and
acquiring manuscripts and taking the risk of meeting expenses" being what
literary presses are "supposed to do," I agree as long as it's not
necessarily assumed that the only way of meeting those expenses is through
the sale of books. In that regard, most poetry presses have an extremely
difficult time, and many depend (and have depended, for decades if not
centuries) on subsidies of various kinds -- whether it's donations from
patrons, subsidization by the press's owner/directors, government and
foundation subsidies, subsidies by poets published and friends/supporters
of those poets, and even, in centuries removed from our own, subsidies from
kings/queens/dukes/duchesses/etc.  With such subsidies being increasingly
difficult to find, and sales of books of poetry hardly able to take up the
slack, I'm not at all surprised that presses are coming up with innovative
ways of trying to meet expenses and publish books. I only get disgusted
when such schemes are unfair, and when there are no other fee-less ways for
poets to get published. But there are always ways, as the continuing
emergence of new presses and journals (documented so marvelously on this
list) shows.

Fellow-Listafarians, Apologies to any back channelers who had their
messages to me bounce back. I neglected to announce to the List that I was
shutting down e-mail for a few days. I did not expect to be shut down quite
so long, though. My stupefied server took 48 hours to restore service
following my request. In fact, just now I got it back. I had been to
Vancouver, Fri-Mon.

I stopped by the bpnichol conference to watch and hear old friends
discourse upon bp. The panel I was able to attend--I know you will correct
me if I'm mistaken, George Bowering, as you were the Moderator--offered
Frank Davey, arguing for a decent keeping apart of things vis-a-vis bp's
poetry, cautioning against totalizing narratives of the oeuvre's meaning;
and panel-mates Daphne Marlatt and Fred Wah cautioning against Frank's
approach.

I sat there and observed these young persons who can now nearly pass for
old codgers and geezer-babes (a Sonoma County term, coined by one, so not
found offensive here), recalling how Frank, seated once more, 37 years
later, next to Daphne, nee Buckle, had prefaced his first book of poems,
D-DAy and After (1961 ?) with Hopkins' "Buckle, and the fire that breaks
from thee, then."

Fred Wah was gracious enough to slot yours truly into the monster reading
so I spent 5 minutes onstage. I remembered that Fred had published my first
book. Merci pour ca, dude.

The evening readings were often wonderful. McCaffery's nonsense rimes that
insinuate so much sense; Wershler-Henry's tour de force of "ways to write"
that goes around slamming all the doors opened by Bernadette Mayer's
(nonetheless still handy) list, only to up the ante; Judy Copithorne's
ad-libbed sentiments re the temporary closing of the passage of time ("I
sat behind Fred in Warren's class--I memorized the back of his neck!"); Jen
Lim's excellently choreographed performance pieces. . .I need to get some
snailmail off soon, but perhaps I can return to the further pleasures
later.

It was well-attended, the evening readings particularly. Many of the best
and brightest of Vancouver poetry were there, plus contigents from Calgary,
Toronto, and Hornby Island (Hey, Billy!--Have I missed a report to the
List, during my absence?)

Glad to be back, and to find Rilke's translators still getting sorted out. David

If I pay $25 to have my ms. read by Charles Baudelaire, who had already
decided to award the prize to his buddy Ted Gautier or his disciple Steve
Mallarme, I would feel defrauded.  If Charles pockets a fee of a couple
thousand dollars for the difficult task of comparing me unfavorable to
those already in his inner circle, this becomes an even greater scam.
Charles and Ted both benefit at my expense.  "Nice work if you can get it
/ and you can get it if you try."  So to say that the entry fees go toward
the expense of the contest, rather than the production of the book, is
small consolation.

I'm not saying I would never enter such a contest, but I'd have to be sure
it was on the up and up.  In a relatively small circle of poets, say those
interested in "innovative" writing, the situation is even more tricky.
After all, a typical MFA teacher could anonymously judge 500 mss. of
more or less interchangeable material.

I'm imagining some of the better-known prizes receiving several multiples
more in application fees than they could reasonably expect to pay outside
judges.
As to paying production costs from entry fees, that's like passing the hat
while holding a gun in the other hand.
Of course, it's easy for me to ride this high horse--I decided at the
outset that Junction was going to generate a loss. It's why Junction stays
small.
As to subsidies, I'm all for them, but not from the pockets of poets
entering a lottery. I'd love to meet a duchess, by the way. That's my last
one, hanging on the wall.

When I was still young and almost completely unknown, I entered a number of
poetry contests.  None of them required an entry fee.  I won several, one
of which resulted in my receiving an award from then-Mayor Marion Barry --
life produces so many rich ironies!

Foolishly, I thought that such early success might make it easier to get my
work published here and there --

As I grew older and more nearly completely unknown, I began to observe the
geometric increase in the number of "contests" requiring growing fees -- I
noted than only one or two of them went so far as to send a copy of the
winning book to those who paid the fees to enter -- I had not the money in
any event, and entered none of these -- But, having now read somewhat
widely and come to recognize any number of names and styles, I observed
that the judge, even in "blind" competitions, often seemed to have selected
a winner whose work was previously known to the judge -- which is another
way of saying that it was seldom the case that an exciting "unknown" was
turned up by this means --

I was once entered into a contest against my will by a friend/editor after
telling him I wanted no part of any contests -- but as he didn't charge me
the fee I did not take it badly that I wasn't selected --


My advice -- contest everything -- in writing!

I would be interested to hear from Doug M. as to how Sun & Moon's
process works for both the national poetry series and the new american
series. The overhead has to be astounding.

Mark, I was upset with how unethical contests are also which is why I
set one up.
We ask for $7. I pay the contest readers $250. I pay the winner $500
plus 25 copies. Every US resident who sends a SASE with $1.01 rec. a
copy of the winner & other countries add a bit more. We are one of the
only who continue this policy. The books have very high production
values & are perfect bound so you need to add at least $500 to cover the
number of free copies that are sent out. You get an idea of the minimum
number of folks who have to send in just for me to break even. Then
there's the whole cost of promoting the contest to add. The best way I
know to be aware of the validity of the press if you are not familiar
with it already is to add up what's obvious. For example, one contest
asks for $10 for a chapbook contest & the prize is $100 & 25 copies of
the winner. They don't send out free copies or subscriptions. The part
they don't tell you is that they only do a press run of 50 to 100
copies. & they are publicly funded. Since their contest judge is paid
$200, their whole cost structure would covered with forty entries,
including cost of the book. That's taking advantage of writers.

^I'm not sure it's ok to ask applicants to pay for the printing of
someone else's book.^
I disagree, mainly because of the way we do this. If you recieve a copy
of the book, like the press, and want to support it anyways, contests
give a writer a chance at winning an award for free, while supporting a
worthwhile venture.

Charles brings up some good points here:
Do you pay the contest readers, and do you pay them a decent wage of $25
per hour or more? Yes.  I can't expect them to do it for free.
And if the people running the press are the readers, then what if they
decide to put that money into the production of the book rather than
into their pockets? We use volunteers & myself. It goes back into the
book so that would be difficult to clarify as to where it fits now that
folks are trying to get us money for the first time I'll have to work
something out for that, thanks!
How do you decide what's profit -- is that after
salaries/fees/overhead/etc. are deducted?
This is the hardest part. There is mailing out free copies to the judge,
to people who do the blurbs, to helpers, & etc. The ads. The mailing of
announcements & so on. I figure we break even and keep the press
publishing by the exposure and orders rec during the process.

   Thanks all (Jonathon, Edward, Tom, Rachel, Jordan, and any I missed)
   for responding to the didacticism post.....
   (oh yeah, and henry).
   I don't think that "didacticism leaves no room for dialogue or
   ambiguity" (as Tom said) though. For isn't the very statement--
   "poetry shouldn't be didactic" a didactic statement....
   Sorry I am not responding more fully now---but I'm burnt out
   from too much adjuncting (perhaps explaining my interest in
   "didacticism" as of late, an attempt to adjust my aesthetics
   to my situation?)....
   Anyway, what to make of jordan's hairsplitting "moral" vs.
   "instructional" distinction?
   Can "complaint" or "confession" be considered "didactic"?
   Other questions abound, and keep one from sleep.....
   Is sleep didactic?

I heard a terrific band in Seattle from Tokyo called Harpy tonight. They fuse highly percussive
jazz with rock and staccato Japanese influences. Their timing is complex and impeccable. Kyoko,
the lead singer, is often instrumental in her vocals in the sense that rather than continuous
drawn out breaths she is playing staccato notes with the other musicians. But she can also belt
it out. They're a very funny band also, their music is often funny, I mean.

They apparently check their email regularly. Evidently they are off to New York very soon and
thence Michigan, and then to France. If anyone is reading this in the New York area or Michigan
or thereabouts and is interested in getting a gig for them, I think you would find your efforts
rewarded with a well-pleased audience.

Two sources:
BXF03053@nifty.ne.jp is Kenji Ito's email address. He's the drummer and writes the music.

Some of their music can be heard on the Web at

Subject:      Judging
Content-Type: text/plain

Part of what amazed me most about receiving the Pew Fellowship for the
Arts this year was that I had neither met nor ever corresponded with any
of its judges. (I have subsequently met one of them.)

But I must say that in a community that is as relatively small as the
poetry scene, the idea of "blind" judging and the idea of "screeners"
seems to me fraught with silliness. Too many places use the screening
process incorrectly and I've heard too many judges moan about no good
work got through. Possibly that's what happened to Merwin with the Yale
this past year (Don't know for sure).

I, too, received a grant (from NY state) from a panel of judges I had never
met. On the other hand, I know of several cases in which judges have urged
friensa to submit work.

Okay, I should temper the cynicism of my previous post by admitting to
having received the same blind beneficence as bestowed by a NYFA panel as
well. In fact, I  heard that many years ago a NY State arts panel (it was
called CAPS back then), rejected an application on the grounds that the
work was too derivative of Ashbery's, only to discover later that the
rejected applicant was none other than Ashbery himself.  Though some may
find that story terrifying, for me it's strangely comforting.

This reminds of an article I read awhile ago in the _Times_  by a journalist
who submitted under his own name, a typescript of Kosinksi's novel _Steps_ --
which had just won that year's National Book Award or something similar -- to
a dozen major publishers, including the publishing house that had just
published the book.  Not only was the ms. universally rejected, but Kosinski's
own publisher didn't even recognize it -- they turned it down for being too
"experimental."

As re Ashbery, he of course won the 1955 Yale Younger Poets prize after first
having had his ms rejected by a screening panel. Auden, a friend, & that
years' judge -- after learning that Ashbery had submitted a ms that he, Auden,
had never seen, asked Ashbery to reapply.  O'Hara, too, had had his poems sent
back for having arrived late.  Auden asked him to send along his ms as well.

I was nominated & received a grant from a panel that included an
acquaintance of one of my grad school professors. I didn't apply for the
grant, but am I guilty by association?

Seriously, though, Ron's comment seems sensible. This is a small
community--even factoring in different "schools,"  so isn't it likely that
if you've done a bit of publishing, there's a good chance that *someone* on
a panel of judges would know you or one of your friends or your friend's
publisher, etc. etc. etc.?

That's clearly a different situation from a fee-based contest.  The artist
mafias who sit on panels will always know some of the academic mafias whose
friends are artists.

One can always hope so.  It is a small cozy community.  Little schools,
swimming along in little pools, blurrping out their inky black squidpies.

Does anyone know what happened to the poet Alfred Levinson after he
published _Cauldron_ (James A. Decker Press) in 1948? The next book I
see--which may or may not be the same Alfred Levinson--is in 1965. Then
there's "Paris, lost and found" published by Poesie vivante in 1968. I'm
looking for any sort of information about Levinson's work and life.

If you have anything at all, I'll be grateful. Please write to me directly
at afilreis@english.upenn.edu.

Thanks.

Mark, could I trouble you to actually _list_ the cases in which judges
solicited or "urged" work from friends? -- assuming that wouldn't be too
embarrassing for anyone.  I'm interested in specific names, contests,
grants, etc etc.  GG

1). Mark, Jeepers, I'd go so far as to say that what's in fact embarrassing
is not frank open discussion about such matters, but the kind of casual
and _sub rosa_ arrangements that ultimately wind up costing many poets
time, cost of entry fee, cost of postage -- or, in the case of grants,
the cost of the time writing the grant etc etc:

2). these being the very same injurious sub rosa casual arrangements that
cause us to button-up out of some odd sense of guilty decorum, right?

3). It's often tough, I know, to separate guilt and complicity from decorum.

4). No high-horse is being sat on here: I have asked simply for a frank
and disinterested discussion of these matters -- and a frank discussion
would seem to predicate we not withhold names, yah?

5). You wrote "that would of course be embarrassing and a violation of
confidence" (vide infra), but jeewhiz one wonders just how much this
(dare I say priggish) decorous professional privacy has cost poets over the
years, monetarily and otherwise.

6). Anyone care to comment?

Global Crisis "Worsening and Deepening"


Guy in Belgium hacks his hedgefund, turns securities into Japanese pass-
alongs, convert fast to Thai currency. Meanwhile Indonesia banks on Bra-
zilian Amazon rubber; there's none left where this investment lies. New
York City cancels World Bank loans to Kenya; key men in Afghanistan hold
the landmine market in the hands of four, count them, Southern Indians.

The markets creak, corrode; everyone skims from everyone else. There are
no cracks, none, where everything is cracked, falling apart. It's a thick
crust sliding everywhere across the rest of the world - not that they
wouldn't loanshark if they could. It's an avatar crust, loaded with get-
rich schemes, internets, intranets, movements of goods and currencies hard
and soft, ploughing under whatever's left of wilderness. Everything turns
towards management; management runs riot with Australian uranium, South
American oil, Antarctica coal which has just finally burned the Ross Ice
Shelf past the point of no return. Slaughter of the guilty takes the last
remaining penguins; portfolios grow in the Hague, collapse in Norway, ex-
pand in Belgrade. Russian stockpiles fuel Saudi hopes; missiles will take
out the rest, but there's money to be made in charred remains. The Net
creaks with deals gone bad, collapsing markets, currencies hitting rock
bottom; starvation's kept out of it.

The crust turns cancerous; cracks spread, whole chunks crash to the ground
taking everything in their path. This is rough substance, violent, tumors
raging within it, churning everything in its path. The crust leaks and
topples; the rest of us would die for the same leprosy, local gangrenes
begging for full-fledge suppuration.

Maws open up; breath stinks of decay as Malaysian death squads swallow
Eurodollars on spec, transform yen into Canadian dollars collapsing Peru-
vian banks. New York wallstreeters gouge eyes, street-fight for World Bank
loans passed on by baby crack whores sold by Serbian traders working out
of Scotland. The British make the drug hard for Chinese merchandising;
everyone swallows Vietnam. Bamboo run by avatars crosses the Atlantic and
Pacific; Albanian finance terrorists are hung by their tongues from it.
Colombian savings and loans fortify, warning off Greek mercenaries looking
for an easy buck. The crust heats up; lava flows like shit from gaping
crevices; French bankers lap it up, their faces burned to a crisp. Sales
are up on the Net; Finland creaks, fucks itself, dies in ice, drowned in
semen worth big bucks in Mali. Insane Mexican pilgrims carry gold from
Fort Knox into North Korea; starved teeth break against hard yellow. It's
worth it says the Web page.

The crust shifts; Americans explode Bali, sell pieces of flesh to starving
Israel and Iraq. Cash flows in big money veins; there's nothing stopping
it. The crust turns incandescent, swallows the silver supply. Gangrene
chews out arms and legs, cocks and cunts, chews breasts, tongues, blinds
and deafens. Bodies for dividends are shoved into the shit. Crust burns
everything. Planets wobble; the world splits, returning two for one.

i'm coming in on this late, and must admit to not having such a great stake
in the discussion, but this starrish insistence on exposing details is
unsettling and there is an imputation of bad faith i find disturbing.  we
all know writers function in small and overlapping communities. it seems a
far cry from urging a friend to avail him/herself of an opportunity one
knows of to "rigging" a contest.  to invoke a parallel that i'm more
familiar with, when a position becomes available in an academic department
people routinely contact the good people they know in that field (which
often will include friends) and urge them to apply.  since these positions
often draw several hundred applicants, it is understood that an invitation
to apply does not guarantee a job, even when one's best friend is on the
hiring committee.  occasionally nepotism does win out, as in searches that
are for inside candidates but that by law have to be nationally advertised,
in which case, to be frank, openness was not at issue in the first place.
these latter matters are indeed cause for some chagrin, but i don't really
see how institutions could operate otherwise.

I was holding back from this discusion but I too have recieved grants in
the past and I have always gotten them as special favors to me in other
words as straight economic and political quid pro quos. The best deal
was the one I struck with Exxon right after the Valdez spill. They had
just initiated their POETS, VOX POPULI campaign and you can bet your
sweet ass I wanted a taste of that $440,000,000.00 pot. I had provided
some forged end user certificates to a group of mercenaries in Angola to
purchase weapons for Savimbi, so the boys at Exxon, who were trying to

a.) Again I'm not insisting folks operate otherwise: I'm not talking
about jobs gotten via contacts or mutual second parties.

b.) Am talking about prizes and competitions and the act of judging, and
the tip of the hat that many of these competitions make to ensure a
sense not only of "fairness" but of "possibility": namely blind-reading,
-- and how curiously that practice compares to the recently stated idea
that what we have here is a small community which cannot help but be
governed by bias and personal taste and reputation.

c.) Kenneth Starr has too many double consonants in his name to have
anything but a duplicitous character: I am however not a muckraker.  My
interest is that of a mildly stupid arriviste -- nothing more.

d.) There have been previous testimonies on this list about how the
above prob is both frustrating and curious.

e.) The implication that my interest shows bad faith is half-goofy,
therefore:  I'm talking about "open" competitions and prizes and prize
money and "judges" (not _colleagues_).  These are questions everyone has
thought about and that everyone has spoken about: nothing muckrakey about
any of this, nothing starry either.  Am not starry-eyed or muck-booted, am
curious.

f.) If my questions make anyone feel icky, I apologize: were not asked in
bad faith but out of more or less innocent curiosity.

g.) I miss my grandmother.

I find this whole discussion fascinating--and I don't think it's unsettling
for GG to be asking such questions. If, in fact, some judges or hiring
committees or grant panels are asking friends to submit because this or
that friend also just happens to be a really terrific poet, then why not
expose the fact that the judge/panel etc and the candidate are friends?

In other words, if a teacher asks his/her student to submit simply because
the student is good--and the student is indeed "good"--then why would the
teacher or student be embarrassed about the nepotism?

I, personally, think that yes, some of the nepotism in poetry is kind of
okay... it has something to do with community and with shared aesthetic
considerations and, perhaps, with a sweet sort of "personism".... but I
also think that a lot of the big prizes are in fact scams. The fact that
there are so many of them is what strikes me as a scam... why is it that
almost no press will publish a writer's first book unless the writer pays
in $10-$25?

Best,
Katy

i don't think asking these questions is at ALL muckraking, or starry eyed.
a statement that keeps coming up time and time again is in part just exactly
what makes me queasy.  everyone keeps coming back to "it is a small community;
everyone knows someone" in one way or another.

well, it is NOT a small community.  i've been helping edit, for example, a
small, not wildly famous 'ezine for a couple of years.  every month, we get
wonderful work from people and places we've NEVER heard of before.  people
who are not online, have not been published anywhere.

it is a HUGE community, with people from ALL OVER who are writing in
tiny towns dotting the west, midwest, east, north, south, alaska,
hawaii, japan, tibet.  for just ONE example, has anyone on this list
heard of carmen butcher?  i would absolutely guarantee not.  well,
carmen is an extraordinary writer who popped up on my screen with
submissions (you can see her work in the memory issue of the free
cuisinart, as well as in upcoming Extended Play issue) a few months
ago.  she has interesting credentials -- fullbright in english at
oxford, lit degree.  but, NO ONE HAD HEARD OF HER.  and i think we are
the first people to publish her.  small community BULLWAH!  it is a
small community when we shut it down to new people who don't know
anyone.  it is a small community when grants are given to our friends,
and we can't be bothered to read through any other work that got sent
in.  it is a small community when we only send word about grants, and
magazines, and submission opportunities to our friends, instead of
taking out ads in community newspapers, sending things on
multi-subscriber lists, posting notices on bulletin boards all over
the web, sending notices to english departments in community colleges,
state schools, universities, AND tiny art centers in tiny towns
dotting the all over.

another example: an online zine, Tintern Abbey.  the proprieter, chris
tannlund, spent months posting notice of the zine everywhere he could
think of.  he received hundreds of submissions, many from people he'd
NEVER heard of as well as a number he had.

years back, i was a totally broke, shy, new writer.  i submitted to
contests, magazines, reading series, mfa programs, conferences and
workshops galore... but... i didn't know anyone.  i hadn't BEEN at
those mfa programs, READ at those reading series, hung out at those
conferences with those Big Names.  so i didn't have any Big Names to
write the "recommendation letters" many venues overtly requested.  or
have a word with any of the judges.  or let anyone in the department
know i was a "strong candidate."  and for the most part, i got
trashed.  shitpiled.  who was i, some nobody from the midwest?  who
cares about her.

but those very departments, contests, reading series, etc. more often
than not got their funding, waved flags about, bragged over, how they
were "famous" because of all the "new writers" that came from there.
new writers?  baloney.  writers that "knew" someone in the "small"
community that was all they were open to.  certainly not the shitpile
of writers from tuckahoe tennessee who couldn't muster anyone famous
for a golden signature letter, those pathetic writers who really were
dumb enough to BELIEVE the "open to anyone" written on the promotion
materials, who were dumb enough to believe that if you send off a
group of 5 or 7 or 12 of your best poems or stories, that will be what
weighs with the judges, or readers, or whatever for that mfa, or
contest, or grant.

now i finally HAVE a 'zine of my own, and the zine (in part because of
web and search engine dynamics) really IS open.  and we advert in
unfamiliar and wierd places as well as known ones.  and we have a rule
that each editor doesn't make decisions on work from people they know.
we also solicit, sometimes from our "friends."  but we both also make
a point of searching out and finding complete strangers on the web to
ask for work from.

i'd bet alot of people on this list have gone through the same thing.
i know i've been seeing promos for new mags, small presses, etc. and
they often have names i have never heard of before, names of people
appearing for first time, often first time ever, not just in that zine
or venue.

so alot of us are doing what i do -- where are all of you?  you know,
from your own experience, that this does not have to be a small
community.

can you talk about how you opened your contests, presses, magazines,
reading series, grant panels, to work from people you DIDN'T know, to
the BIG world outside the small one?


ps.
AND how you opened your lists (like poetics)?

As a member of the shitpile
of writers from tuckahoe tennessee (actually Murfreesboro, believe it or
not) I do appreciate the numerous calls for work and opportunities to
discuss issues on this list.  I can to some degree participate even
though I don't dwell in the right circles, if there are, in fact, right
circles.

to the question of small vs. large communities (due allowances for "large"
and "small"):  both exist, and there are reasons why both should exist...
the former works differently than the latter, and we might go on and on as
to which is "better," we might propose a continuum from small to large,
etc...

but from an academic['s] standpoint:  here we go, from a *current* mla job
list opening in creative writing (mla now offers the list online)---i'll
keep the name of the institution out of it simply b/c my point is not to
target specific schools:

>applicants should show evidence of outstanding promise (a book/prominent
>>magazine publications, prizes, good teaching, and strong academic
>interests).

we all know that prizes are occasionally given to stuff that comes in over
the transom... however, and at the same time, i assure you that the above
institution is likely to privilege applicants whose book is on a "national
press" (a term used all the time in the mla job lists) and whose prizes are
themselves known quantities---this is, in general, what constitutes
"promise"...

which is to say, that if the question of prizes reduces to being properly
connected, it's a bit of a sham, no?... it's one thing to interview someone
b/c someone else vouches for their character... it's another to set up a
networking-structure that permits only such & such ethnicities, or such and
such awards, into the mix... and yes---the "letters of recommendation"
requirement can work in precisely this way---if we let it...

i'm not suggesting, btw, that awards are as crucial as ethnicities... and i
don't generally trust institutional structures that are geared toward
separating the "good" dozen applicants from the "less good" or "outright
bad" 200 or so (my way of making a political-economic point, if you
will)... favorites will be played, no doubt, simply b/c there aren't enough
goodies to go around... on this basis i would suggest that the only thing
keeping the game "honest" is one's (and two's) commitment to giving each
and all an open and fair hearing (i.e., not to discard applications from
those with small press publications, those who wear high-top sneakers
ETC.---and if you ain't see this done, you're not living on my planet)...

that said:  what frustrates me most about the awards network is the general
sort of writerly ethos it helps proliferate... yknow---you get your mfa (or
whatever), then you busy yourself first and foremost getting your work
placed in the "best" magazines and journals... and then---when you have a
sufficient accumulation of new work---you circulate your manuscript through
the awards circuit... for some writers i know---some of whom are dear
friends, some of whom are fine writers---this constitutes their most urgent
sense of their professional-writerly selves... this is the way they've
learned the "trade," their "craft," ETC...

i don't have to indicate why this is such---or can be such---a bad thing,
do i?... sure, there are exceptions too... but my point here is that,
*however* such awards are judged (and i've got one small award myself on my
vita---2nd place for the first poem i ever published---entirely over the
transom), this matter of making writers dance through such hoops as a
primary part of their professional development, as a primary part of how
they come to the act of writing and publishing, leaves a helluvalot to be
desired...

assuming, that is, that the community in which said writers work, which
includes of course a working sense of community, works something like that
job ad (above)... and then, hey, we're back to the community issue, no?...

best,

It certainly does, but we also have to remember that the hoops are for those
who want to pursue that kind of *professional* development, which is different
for many of us from our *writerly* development.

They seem like two different jobs. Some people pursue one or the other, and
some pursue both. I think there's a sense that those who pursue the
professional trappings are somehow less "pure" than those who don't. But what's
wrong with someone doing the whole national publisher/award/nepotism circuit if
it suits them? To think that the high-top crowd loses out on something because
there are all these credentialed professional poets out there seems silly.
Harvard isn't going to hire someone with a single chapbook to their credit, no
matter *how* good the chapbook is. Not because Harvard is evil, but because
it's a business.

And I can't help but wonder with amusement if perhaps one reason there's such a
call for those with heavy, specifically national publishing credits isn't
because the university's don't know *how* to judge poetry, and figure they'd
better go with someone someone else has recognized. The cover your ass factor
seems high.

karen, i think what you say is true... still, i find much to lament in the
way many come to this... profession!... b/c in the end, it's not that we
couldn't all use a pat on the back---it's that the system (and all said and
done, i think there IS one, professionally speaking) will eats its young...

i mean to say that this is where institutional politics square off, for
one, against aesthetics... and given the once and future economics of the
postsecondary teaching profession (my remarks are not aimed at reducing the
discussion to same), it seems to me that those who opt to "play" themselves
thataways are feeding the system (i.e., the one that eats its young)...

which isn't to say that if you win an award, you should feel "guilty" or
some such... but i am saying---yes i am---that i expect better---yes i
do---and i expect better even from those who've proved successful playing
that game... i expect those who've been that lucky, or that single-minded,
NOT (e.g.) to evaluate me as a writer on the basis of NOT having taken that
path... i'll try to do the same---ONCE i see an mla job ad that reads
approx.

"must have publications, small press writers welcome"

and ysee, my hunch is---based in everything i've seen in this
profession---that i'm asking a lot... b/c the sort of commitment it takes
to propel you in said professional directions is substantial---and
generally requires that you act in kind...

as to harvard being evil (sans religious connotations):  well yes and no,
as with most institutions... some are less evil than others, but most seem
to promote a certain level of evil, as well as good (which isn't to ignore
that a given institution might be primarily evil or primarily good or
whatever)... but when harvard does evil or good---harvard, the most heavily
endowed university in the u.s.---well, you can expect to hear about the
good, right?... and i think we might oughta consider worrying over that
evil...

best,

joe

Karen--I think your last paragraph is, like the brits say, spot on. But I
have some problems with your second. Sure, it's two different jobs, and
some are disinclined or less able to perform the "professional" one.
Something--a lot--is lost, however, in the foregrounding of that task. Some
of the high-top crowd have included, say, Blake, Clare, Leopardi,
Dickinson, Niedecker, and, until recently, virtually everyone in Don
Allen's anthology (I could tell you what kind of reception my teaching
Olson at Columbia got in 1968). Can you imagine Harvard's reaction to
Blake's job application? "Self-publishes, small-press only, and a bit
eccentric."

oh hell, and while i'm here, i may as well admit to that wee bit of
confrontational rhetoric in my last post...

i was trying to say that i try not to judge too harshly those who tend to
judge too harshly... but that, at times, i find it real fucking tough...

and really:  it's difficult for me to sit across the table from a
"mainstream" writer whose work i admire, while he bashes the very work that
i cherish---by association bashing my work... esp. when the entire
publishing apparatus he so values is implicitly and explicitly oriented
toward sanctioning his work and not mine...

(please to insert appropriate pronouns for "he" and "his" and "i" and "my"
and "mine")...

those in positions of power should be held accountable---by who else? but
by those NOT in positions of power... harvard, e.g., is a case in point...
clinton is another (which is not to say that i think he should resign,
btw)...

and on a related note:  i must confess that the contest circuit has really
become nauseating to me... last time i browsed through the awp chronicle
(yes, i'm a member) i saw a "potluck" contest (i sincerely hope i'm not
trampling over anyone's feelings here)... it struck me as, well, so
precious, yknow---but i really can't imagine it emerging from any but the
most privileged notions of authorship and publication...

ysee you say these things aloud, you get yourself in trouble...

best,

Some of us need money just to survive and we are quite isolated. And there
is no money or just not enough. So a grant and a contest can be a big
thing. And if we do not belong to a circuit or a group at all the chance
is we will holler in the wind if we apply for such a grant and a contest.
This is just so evident it hardly needs to be said. There are no verifying
principles in the arts and we tend most often but not all of us to cluster
and influence each other. So of course we will give a money and a prize to
those of our friends who we find when we are on committee. This is so
natural it hardly needs to be said. But some of us are just so isolated
that we can be published because there is room for that but in a grant and
a contest there is no room because it is easier to find magazine room than
grant room. So we will be published but we will just never have enough
money for anything. This is always the case of the world and while I do
not like it and even suffer from it, I must say to my friends when they
ask, this is always the case of the world. Now I will go play.

I resent Mr. Amato's harsh and impolitic remarks. How could poetry have
achieved its current stature within the culture at large without
compromise? Compromise and capitulation are two ways we develop a sense
of community. Just ask Congress or any other "cigar filled room."

Prizes, awards and grants also build a sense of community. Hasn't Mr.
Amato ever been to a state fair and watched as the blue ribbon was
pinned on the prize heifer?

How naive of Mr. Amato to insist that poetry be a meritocracy while all
these egos are still walking around breathing. Besides, not only is the
meritricious more applicable to the living, because we often desire not
to offend, it is more inclusive.

Further, you can't judge a great poet the same way you can judge say a
great CEO, politician or weapons designer. Standards for poetry have to
be found outside of poetry itself in places like the academy.

In this we are greatly aided, as Ms. Lederer points out, by adopting the
buddy system of corporate America. 'Objective' criticism is devisive and
unmannerly. Therefore by harnessing the unmannerly element of
competition within a system of awards, prizes, grants and publications,
we can pretend to standards higher than Bill Gates, Billy Sol Estes and
Bebe Rebozo. I've noticed that some major poets lately have become "too
big to fail" just like some banks, corporations and brokerage houses.
And as for friends, the great Roman arbitrager, Commodious, wrote "A
friend is just a stranger that you let get close enough to kill you."
(His power of prophecy were amazing. Most murders in America ARE
committed by someone who knows the victim.)

That we poets have adopted the ethos of the marketplace with virtually
none of its procribed benefits, points only to the need for more prizes
and grants. Journalists now lead the list in numbers of awards and
prizes that they present to their fellows in the profession. Need I say
more, my dear Mr. Amato.---Carlo Parcelli, compadre

what on EARTH is "potluck contest" joe?  i'm trying to imagine...

"..hmmm, i'll bring that set of potholders aunt alice crocheted, and the
plaster dog with the basket in his mouth with just that little chip by
the tail... o.k., good summer ku, i'll give it the plaster dog..."

- everyone brings one line, and you all assemble togehter a poem for
the evening?  and everyone gets to take some words home, if there are
any leftovers?

- everyone brings a peice of writing, and you all put it together in a
book, and then vote on which peice of writing you like best, and the
person who got the most votes wins, and everyone gets to take home a
couple books, but the winner gets to take home a bunch?...

this reminds me of when someone told me some car dealership was offering
"golden keys" and i spent weeks thinking they must give you some tacky

Reminds me of the Prix Queneau, my personal favorite. The poet/novelist
Raymond Queneau, who spent his working hours overseeing the most
establishment of all French presses (tho the term hardly translates into
our sense of established), once a year would don full dress attire, go to
Les Halles in the wee hours, and buy a bushel of oysters. Then he would
knock on the door of the writer whose book he had liked best in the
previous year, and when the bleary-eyed winner answered the door he'd shove
the oysters into his arms, announcing, "You have pleased me," and leave.

So what is a gold key?

Commonplace perhaps but needs come out again & again because competition is
such an integral part of the literary industry.  There must be a better way
of distributing money.  As Joe pointed out, it comes back to community - it
seems absurd to pluck out one lucky winner out of a community of writers.
The potluck idea sounds more appealing (the "ideal game": an affirmation of
chance ...

To push the country fair/prize heifer idea even futher, does anyone take
bets on literary prizes?  The Booker or the Nobel Prize or some such?  Now
there's a business idea if someone's not already doing it ...

Welcome back Eliza.

Its great to be open to contributors - across borders for instance - and =
not just from within your own backyard.

But its just so costly. With the current exchange rate, ten dollars for a =
poem becomes seventeen, a money order is another ten ... then theres =
postage.

It can be inhibiting.

carlo's got me smiling here!...

actually, e, i can't recall now whether the 'potluck' thing was a contest
or a call for poetry... hmmmm... but here again, the way such an appeal is
situated in the awp chronicle, the effect is pretty much the same (for
yours truly, that is)... in fact i'm blanking in part b/c i find such stuff
so discouraging...

we've had some good examples here of contests that are entirely on the up &
up, as well as contests that serve a particular community well, bringing
money into the hands of those who need it... what i was trying to establish
was a particular aspect of contests---the way they're deployed in academe,
under the "creative writing" rubric---that leaves a lot to be desired...
for a spell i too was under their spell---but not any longer... the closest
i'll come to submitting anything i write to a contest is the nea grant
system...

now i can imagine a contest where favors are par for the course... we've
covered this ground here on poetics before---in my soon-to-be-former
humanities dept., we have an annual writing contest where students are
SUPPOSED to ask instructor/judges for help on their entries... obviously
the work of those students who do this year in and year out will become a
known quantity in relatively short order... any attempt at blind review is
thereby defeated from the start... but this is the way this contest has
been proposed and run for many years now...

i'm not saying, btw, that i'm entirely comfortable with this, either... but
i AM saying that EVERYONE involved knows how this works, has worked...

not so when you use "national" contests and "national" presses and the like
to discriminate between "promising" and "unpromising" writers in a
*national* job search for a creative writing professor... this latter is an
entirely different affair, and if the contests aren't entirely on the up &
up, you're messing with bread & butter issues... and no---i don't think
that *everyone* knows how this works---whether we're talking the
contest/awards system itself or the way said awards are used by search
committees... i suppose, on the one hand, part of being a "professional" is
being aware of same... but this doesn't make such apparatus any the more
appealing, or necessary...

of course i can imagine the counterargument quite easily---that winning
such awards and participating in such contests is key part of one's
"professional development"... but then, once again, and as dan h has just
indicated, one would have to ask just what sort of "professional community"
is thereby encouraged...

which is what brought me out of lurk in the first place---i think the
question of corrupt contests, though interesting in some ways, is less
significant, finally, than that of the question of judging itself... this
latter has been the subject, too, of some discussion here wrt the slam
scene... but i'm only keeping with what i know best---how academic creative
writers are brought into the fold...

and one more thing (and also discussed here in the past):  there are plenty
of (imho) shoddy poetry contests and organizations out there... you all
know what i'm talking about---the one's that offer, e.g.,  "anthologies" of
winning poetry for the so-called entry fee... we can all talk about the
cultural work done by reams of hallmark card verse---this is a legitimate
way of discussing such stuff---but really, we all know, too, that the bulk
of work submitted into these contests is, well, pretty uninformed...

anyway, tell me:  how might you distinguish the so-called "important"
contests from these 'populist' operations, anyway?---if not by some appeal
to evaluating on the up & up??? (WHATEVER one makes of contests and
judging)...

best,

joe

Oh, right your that grant sniffing, academic poet, A. Jenn Rimbaud. Your
no Rimbaud, pal. Your talented, but that's all the more reason not to be
whining about this little grant hand out or that pop gun prize. Rimbaud
was never cute and never compromised. Christ, if you were Rimbaud you
would've already abandoned writing for a career in business which legend
holds also included a shot at the slave trade. In this day and age, give
up writing and buy and sell human beings and you may just be in line for
the Dynamite Prize.

-----Original Message-----
I really can't believe that anyone would call poetry a "small community".
And perhaps this is touching a subject completely separate from the fact
that grants are biased, and contests looking for "new writers" are tacitly
requiring that an MFA and list of journal publications be included.  But
this idea of a small community is one of the problems itself.  So many egos
and ambitions only looking up to be accepted into this elite cadre of
professional poets and forgetting what the term community means.

I can and will draw a personal example.  Here in St. Louis I helped to put
together a spoken word CD of entirely unpublished voices.  From our one
independent bookstore, I was offered a list of the 200 "literary" people
from the city, some of them my own professors, some of them teaching MFA to
poets on this disk, some of them people that coordinate poets to come here
from out-of-town.  None of them showed up.  I guess they decided they just
didn't have time to come and listen.

But isn't that what community is?  Isn't community sometimes sacrificing
time to the unknown?  By the fact that they are publishing, I can see they
have personal ambitions that stretch outside of St. Louis.  And that's fine.
But I think there are many times when the wish to get into this "small
community" makes some poets forget that they need to listen as much as they
need to write.  Especially because the audience for poetry IS small
(compared to the audience for novels or TV), and I'm ultimately one of that
small audience that's perhaps going to buy the journal or book they end up
publishing.

1. INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS THE SAWSJ INFORMATION LIST?

A number of responses to last week's e-mailing made it clear that we need
to more clearly define the purpose of this list and its relation to SAWSJ.
The list is run by SAWSJ with the goal of providing a medium for
information exchange and discussion among intellectuals, artists, and
activists involved in, and in solidarity with the multicultural,
international working-class movement.  The list's orientation is activist
rather than scholarly, in the sense that we want to carry messages that
are mainly concerned with possibilities for organizing and action.  Most
SAWSJ members subscribe to the list, but the majority of the subscribers
to this large list are not in SAWSJ, although they clearly share a broad
political outlook with SAWSJ.  Likewise, the messages that are posted to
the list are not officially endorsed by SAWSJ unless this is clearly
stated.

For example, the messages, posted in August, that solicited support to the
Tom Leedham Legal and Accounting Fund and the TDU's Teamster Rank and File
Education and Legal Defense Foundation (TRF) -- the messages that irked
Hoffa Jr. and crowd -- were not endorsed by SAWSJ but were for the
information of subscribers.  The notices posted in support of the Flint GM
strikers, or of Kate Bronfenbrenner against Beverly Enterprises, however,
were SAWSJ initiatives -- and that was clearly stated.

Our hopes are that we can turn the current list into a vital forum for
ideas on how to build the struggle.  We, however, have no interest in
trying to make it into a simple transmission belt for SAWSJ.

                                Andor Skotnes

============================================================

2. BEVERLY ENTERPRISES'S SUIT AGAINST ROSEMARY TRUMP AND SEIU 585

The last e-mailing to the SAWSJ Information List included a call to e-mail
the Speaker of the House in support of Rosemary Trump and SEIU 585 in
their fight against the Beverly Enterprises defamation suit (see SAWSJ web
site for the details of the suit).  Unfortunately, the e-mail address
given didn't work for some of us, although it apparently did for others.
It seems that the e-mail address given for Gingrich was correct, but may
be programmed to receive e-mail selectively.  Whatever the case, if you
want to send a support message on this issue you can:

1) try the e-mail address again;

2) access Gingrich's web site at http://www.house.gov/gingrich/ and send
your message via its embedded e-mail function;

3) write him at 2428 Rayburn House Office Building, United States House of
Representatives,  Washington, D.C. 20515; or

4) phone his aides at  1-202-225-4501 or  1-202-225-4656.

4. NATIONWIDE ACTIONS TO END CHILD LABOR AND SWEATSHOP ABUSES, OCTOBER 3rd

The National Labor Committee (NLC), the New York based anti-sweatshop
organization that uncovered the Kathie Lee child-labor scandal, has
announced a new two-year campaign focusing on the world's largest
retailer, Wal-Mart. The "People's Right to Know" campaign demands that
corporations:

1) disclose to the public in what factories their goods are being
produced;
2) open factory doors to truly independent monitoring by local religious
and human rights organizations;
3) pay a living wage and respect local and international labor law
(including the right to organize).

 On October 3rd around the U.S. and Canada, activists, Unions, church
groups, and students will hold demonstrations and other actions at
Wal-Mart locations demanding that Wal-Mart respect human and worker rights
at it's thousands of factories and stores. Over 80% of Wal-Mart clothing
is made overseas, far exceeding the industry average of 60%. There will be
a large demonstration in New York at the Kathie Lee/ ABC/ Disney studios
across from Lincoln Center at 1 o'clock on Saturday October 3rd. Please
join the National Labor Committee in this day of protest and consider
having your labor organization/ student group/ community association etc.
endorse the campaign. Call 212 242 3002 for more info.

5. THIRD WORLD NEWSREEL CELEBRATES ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY; PRESENTS NEW
DOCUMENTARY "ANOTHER BROTHER"

Clarence Fitch was a man of and for his times, an African American who
witnessed and took part in the social movements and the history of this
country from the turbulent sixties through the present decade.
Award-winning filmmaker Tami Gold brings his life to the screen in her new
documentary ANOTHER BROTHER.  Telling a story fraught with both heroism
and tragedy, Gold uses Fitch's life as a jumping-off point to explore a
remarkable range of issues -- racism, the Black civil rights movement, the
Vietnam War and its aftermath, the scourge of drugs, and finally the AIDS
crisis.

ANOTHER BROTHER is being presented by the Museum of Modern Art in
celebration of Third World Newsreel's 30th Anniversary on Thursday,
October 8, at 6:30 pm and on Friday, October 9th at 3:00 pm in the Roy and
Niuta Titus Theater 2, 11 West 53 Street, New York City.

ANOTHER BROTHER is anchored in Fitch's early years growing up in Harlem
and Jersey City, his memories of a tight-knit working class family, and
his growing awareness of American racism.  A wealth of archival footage is
combined with period music, a memorable original score, and the
recollections of Fitch's family, friends, and Fitch himself. The
documentary follows Fitch as he enlists in the Marines and finds himself
in Vietnam where he encounters the harsh realities and violence of the
war, as well as the enduring racism of the military.  Fitch survives only
to return to New Jersey angry, alienated, outspokenly anti-war, and with a
drug habit.

Deftly moving from the personal to the wider political canvass, and back
again, ANOTHER BROTHER both honors its subject and digs deeply into the
roots of his struggles.  The social upheaval surrounding Fitch, from inner
city riots and anti-war demonstrations to Fitch's new-found workplace
activism, is pointedly on display in the documentary.  Gold however gives
this complex legacy a new slant by using her character's individual
journey, with its attendant crises, as the prism through which to see his
times.

Clarence became a leader among returned veterans, working against military
intervention and for peace throughout his life.  He fathered a daughter,
who as a grown-up young woman provides one of the most poignant voices in
ANOTHER BROTHER.  But years of heroin use eventually took its toll.  Five
years after going into rehabilitation and becoming drug-free, Fitch fell
ill from pneumonia and was diagnosed with AIDS.  ANOTHER BROTHER closes
with this last battle in Fitch's life.

ANOTHER BROTHER speaks on many levels to diverse audiences: high school
and college students, African American viewers who find in Clarence a role
model and an individual whose life illustrates the deep impact of racism,
and all Americans who seek to understand the challenging times in which we
live.

"Inspiring documentary which recounts the tale of a Black Vietnam War vet
who returned home to Jersey City and somehow managed, even though he was
battling heroin addiction and AIDS, to become an anti-war activist,
high-school mentor and community leader a Reel American hero."
        Jessica Lustig TIME OUT NEW YORK

"A compelling, must see documentary of the Vietnam War period, Black life,
and a social commentary that depicts the richness of a hero who never
stopped fighting for his country, community and people."
        Job Mashariki, Executive Director Black Veterans for Social
Justice

"Tremendous!  An incredibly powerful film that brings contemporary history
to life.  ANOTHER BROTHER follows the complex and often difficult life of
Clarence Fitch, who despite great adversity was able to retain hope and
commit himself to social change.  This illuminating film is more than the
story of one man's life, it's a story about the power of redemption."
        Bill Fletcher, Jr., Director of Education, AFL-CIO


ANOTHER BROTHER was made possible with the support of The Aaron Diamond
Foundation, PSC-CUNY Research Grant, the Robeson Fund, the Puffin
Foundation, Carol Bernstein Ferry and the A.J. Muste Memorial Institute.

6. SENATE PASSES BILL ON NO FUNDING FOR MINORITIES IN COLLEGE!!

A bill will be heard in Congress next week to prohibit
affirmative action in admissions for ANY institution of higher education
that receives ANY federal funding (Pell grants, loans, etc.).

This would end affirmative action in EVERY COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY IN THE
UNITED STATES!

PLEASE READ AND ACT SOON!

Rep. Frank Riggs (R-CA)Chairman of the House Education  Subcommittee on
Children, Youth, and Families is planning to offer an ANTI-AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION in admissions amendment when the Higher Education Act is voted on
the floor NEXT WEEK.

The amendment would prohibit all institutions of higher education from
using affirmative action in its' admission decisions. If even one student
at the institution receives federal funds (i.e., Pell Grant or Student
Loan) they would be violating federal law under this proposal.

Affirmative action would be illegal even if the school believes it is
necessary to insure a diverse student body, or to remedy past or present
discrimination.

Call members of Congress (202) 224-3121  and the President (202) 456-1414.
They need to hear from us the importance of affirmative action.

PASS THIS MESSAGE ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!  ALL OF US WILL LOSE IF THIS
BILL BECOMES THE LAW OF THE LAND!

7. SYRACUSE WORKERS WIN STRIKE! LETTER FROM ORGANIZER

Dear Faculty, Graduate &Undergraduate Students, Clericals & Other
Supporters,

On behalf of the Union and the members of the Syracuse Chapter of Local
200a, SEIU I want to extend our heartfelt and sincere appreciation for all
that you have done to help in our most recent strike.  And, I should add,
all that you continue to do to aid in assuring that Parking Services
workers are not treated as second class citizens by the University.

After taking a couple of days to recoup I have just completed reading, and
responding in some cases, to more than 250 e-mail messages that piled up
over the course of the strike.  It was overwhelming for me to see how much
was going on that neither I, or our members had any idea about.  The
support from Dutch Trade Unionists, the proposed two-day wildcat strike by
faculty, the banner making for the game, the networking for letters to the
Chancellor, the support from Alumni and so on and so on.

What is clear is that the strike became a rallying point for all of us.
It was a unifying process.  And while the immediate concern of the strike
was the wages and working conditions of the service, maintenance and
library workers the struggle has really been one of confronting corporate
arrogance that has infected this academic institution like a disease.  And
that is a struggle that effects us all, directly.  On behalf of the Union
we are proud to fight with you.

For students this corporate arrogance was manifested in the University's
attempt to stifle discussion and debate on a University campus of all
places!  For faculty it was University's threats to penalize, discriminate
against and even fire those who would dare to challenge the authority of
the "boss."  For the members of Local 200A it was the fact that this
corporate giant just refused to acknowledge our issues and our lives.  The
arrogance of power!  The strike did not, as the Chancellor warned,
fracture this campus.  On the contrary the strike unified this campus in
support of building a true "community."

Perhaps what was fractured was the Administration's strangle hold over all
of us. That our, and I do mean OUR (as in all of us), strike was
successful is an understatement.  The fact is that for almost 10 days this
campus was unable to operate normally.  Whether it was dirty bathrooms or
classes being held at the Westcott Community Center, for one week, we
controlled, at least in some Large measure, what was being taught on the
campus.  The strike was a real life drama unfolding in front of all of us.
It was the struggle of normal people struggling to be heard over the
inertia of everyday life which is controlled by corporate interests.  And
we were heard!

In spite of the University's attempts to "sugar-coat" the settlement that
was reached the agreement addressed EVERY ONE of our key issues.  The
University was forced to respond and to concede something on each one.  It
was by all measurements a resounding victory.

1.  On Subcontracting: The University completely backed off any efforts to
change the current restrictions on subcontracting.

2.  On Temporary Workers: The University has agreed to very specific
language that defines a temporary worker  and prohibits them from using
temporary workers to fill permanent positions unless it is to fill in for
someone on disability or leave of absence.

3.  On Stopping the Wage Steps: The University agreed to stop the wage
steps this year, add one more step in the second year of the contract and
stop them FOREVER in the third.  Now everyone will reach the top of
his/her labor grade within 8 years.  As our members say, "There is light
at the end of the tunnel."

4.  On Parking Services: Sadly, we did not get the Parking Services
workers included in our existing agreement.  However, the University
agreed to a contract with Parking Services that will expire on the same
date as the existing agreement.  That means we will fight together again
in three years. The Grievance and Arbitration language from the existing
agreement is in Place immediately and "just cause" for discipline is also
in place immediately. The University has also agreed to the same fringe
benefits as in the existing agreement.  A schedule for negotiating the
rest of the agreement has been set as well.  We will need your continued
vigilance in this regard.

5.  On Protecting Skilled Trades: The University agreed to protect skilled
trades and not allow non-skilled workers to do skilled trades work.
Further, the University agreed to establish a Labor/Management Committee
the purpose of which is to monitor and protect skilled trades.

6.  On Pay Equity for the Library: The University agreed to increase the
entire Library scale by 6% in the first year.  Then increase the top of
all grades by 4% in each of the next two years.  This will result in an
almost %15 increase in the Library Pay Scale.  More needs to be done here,
but it is a recognition of the problem beyond what they wanted to do.

Probably more than anything, what this strike did was to build our
self-respect as a union.  We stood up for what was right and said, "We
won't take it anymore."  Without all of you by our sides there is no
question that our success would have been less certain.  Now, however, we
have built ties that must be maintained and nurtured for future struggles,
not just for SEIU, but for students, faculty and the unorganized on
campus.  We must continue to work together and to build a real community.
Thanks again for all your help.

Several ideas are bubbling around to commemorate the strike.  One is to
put together a booklet with photos and a history of the strike.  Anyone
with special talents in this regard is encouraged to contact me. The other
is a commemorative button.  All will be available for those who helped.

8.  CULTURAL STRATEGY WORKSHOP TO BE HELD AT POOR PEOPLES SUMMIT IN
PHILADELPHIA

"What can we do? For the time being, simply show up--with
our eyes, ears, hearts, and minds open."--Steve Earle

     Hosted by the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU), a Poor People's
Summit will be held in Philadelphia the weekend of October 9-11. Already,
over one hundred poor people's organizations from all over the United
States have committed themselves to come, as have several dozen "non-poor
people's" organizations, such as organizations of social workers and
student groups.

     There will be at least 40 workshops on a mind-boggling variety of
topics pertaining to the struggle to end poverty, including a very
important workshop on the strategic use of culture of all kinds. The
workshop will give artists and cultural organizers a place to share their
experiences and ideas and to establish networking mechanisms for the
future.

Could you please let either myself or Danny Alexander (913-631-5184;
dalexand@gvi.net) know:
        *Your thoughts on what should be included as part of the workshop.
        *Can you attend the Summit? Can other artists and/or cultural
organizers you know?

While the media continue to promote the myth that the American economy is
booming, the 80 million Americans living below the poverty line (which
includes most artists, writers, and musicians) have a different story to
tell.

A big part of that story is that poor people are organizing themselves,
educating themselves, and speaking out very eloquently for themselves. The
Poor People's Summit will provide an important opportunity for the rapidly
growing number of poor people's organizations to coalesce into a
full-fledged movement to end poverty for once and for all.

It's also of the greatest importance to have people from ALL walks of life
at the Summit. First of all, even those of us still making a decent living
are only one or two paychecks (or tours, or grants) away from poverty
ourselves. Of equal importance is the fact that, to be successful, a poor
people's movement needs to shake up every level of society. In a nutshell,
the Poor People's Summit is for EVERYONE who needs or wants to end poverty
in America.

Finally, history has repeatedly shown that the struggles of poor people
provoke an intense reaction from writers, artists, and musicians. If we
can tap into that reaction in an organized way, everything is possible.

For instance, at the Summit a proposal will be presented to approve a
March of the Americas, in which large contingents from Canada, Latin
America, and the U.S. would converge on Washington, D.C. in October 1999
for a march on the UN in New York to continue to press the need of poor
people the world over for economic human rights. With broad involvement
from the cultural communities of this hemisphere, the March of the
Americas can make history and unleash a multitude of possibilities for all
of us to make a difference in this world.

I hope to hear from you soon. I look forward to seeing you in Philadelphia
and, in the meantime, please disseminate This message as widely as
possible.
Thank you very much.

Peace-

9. NATIONWIDE CAMPUS EFFORT IN FARMWORKER BOYCOTT

Action packet available for campus organizers

Campaign for Labor Rights is putting the finishing touches on an extensive
organizing packet for use by student activists who want to build a
campaign on their campus in support of the Gardenburger and FLAV-R-PAC
boycott called by PCUN, the Oregon farmworker union.

To receive a packet, contact Campaign for Labor Rights at <CLR@igc.org or
(541) 344-5410. The Campaign for Labor Rights national coordinator will be
on the road until October 6, accompanying a worker from the Han Young
factory (in Tijuana, Mexico) on an East Coast speaking tour. Upon his
return, the packet will be put in final form and copies will be mailed to
all those who have requested it.

The rest of this alert is the cover letter from the packet.
_______________________

Dear campus activist:

Thanks for your interest in the Gardenburger / FLAV-R-PAC boycott!
Campaign for Labor Rights is joining with PCUN to build a national campus
network for this campaign. We are asking for your help in bringing the
boycott to your campus. This action packet is designed to assist your
organization in working on this issue and joining with other campus groups
in coalition.

This is a winnable struggle. Campus activists are especially
well-placed to make a difference. By getting Gardenburger and FLAV-R-PAC
food products out of your dormitory and student union food services, you
could exert measurable pressure on NORPAC and the Gardenburger company. A
victory in this boycott would give a boost to other farmworker struggles
all across the United States. Campus-based activists have an important
role in the historic struggle of farmworkers to win justice in this
country.

This campaign in support of the Oregon farmworker union PCUN brings
together several important issues.

*   Agribusiness in the United States has created "sweatshops without
walls" for farmworkers who toil long hours under dangerous conditions,
often for sub-minimum wages.

*   Driven by economic necessity, many farmworker families take their
children with them to labor in the fields.

*   Heavy use of pesticides in agriculture poses a serious danger to
farmworkers and those who live within range of "pesticide drift," as well
as to the nation's water supply.

*   U.S. immigration policy makes criminals out of the people who provide
the food on our tables.

Farmworkers in Oregon have struggled for years to win justice from NORPAC,
the largest farm cooperative west of the Mississippi. For many of us, the
word "cooperative" has associations of sharing, but in this case it
represents exploitation. NORPAC is a multi-hundred million dollar,
vertically integrated business controlling everything from growing and
processing to marketing and distribution. It has used its muscle to gets
its way in the state legislature and to see to it that law enforcement
agencies tend to turn a blind eye to violence against PCUN organizers and
intimidation of farmworkers.

Not one grower in the entire NORPAC cooperative has signed a contract with
the union. The growers refuse to bargain in good faith, preferring to
spread disinformation and to engage in union-busting activities. That is
why PCUN has called for a boycott of FLAV-R-PAC, the grower's own brand.
PCUN also has called for a secondary boycott of Gardenburger. The
Gardenburger company continues to use the NORPAC distribution system, even
though good alternatives are available. The president of Gardenburger
declined opportunities to discuss the issue with PCUN and has made public
statements demonstrating a complete lack of sympathy for the plight of
farmworkers. Gardenburger's contract with NORPAC provides profits which
help the growers weather the FLAV-R-PAC boycott. Gardenburger, in spite of
its green image, is no friend of working people.

PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste; in English: Northwest
Treeplanters and Farmworkers United) has done a great job of building
support in Oregon and neighboring states. And word has been getting out to
other parts of the country where coop groceries and natural foods
restaurants have taken up the boycott. PCUN's support network includes
students, labor unions, religious organizations and community activist
groups.

Just when the boycott was starting to have an impact, Gardenburger
budgeted $15 million to a national advertising campaign. PCUN and Campaign
for Labor Rights can't begin to match the financial resources of large
corporations. But we do have something that money can't buy: the
commitment of labor rights activists, environmentalists, immigrant rights
advocates and other people of conscience.

PLEASE:

*   Get in touch: Contact us at <CLR@igc.apc.org or (541) 344-5410 and let
us know if you are interested in working on the Gardenburger / FLAV-R-PAC
boycott.

*   Keep us posted: Let us know about your organization's plans and send
brief reports on your boycott activities.

*   Stay informed: To receive our email alerts on this boycott and other
important sweatshop campaigns, send a message to us at <CLR@igc.apc.org.

*   Use us as a resource: Don't hesitate to contact us if you need more
information or if you want to know who else in your community is
interested in sweatshop issues.

Finally, we wanted to mention that Campaign for Labor Rights and PCUN may
be organizing speaking tours on this issue in the spring. Let us know if
you would like a presentation on your campus.

In solidarity,

Trim Bissell, national coordinator

While I appreciate the need to compromise for the sake of realism or
politesse, I'm just wondering what kind of "current stature" you think
poetry has achieved.  Hmm, maybe we ought to try _less_ compromise; from
the point of view of visibility or popularity (which, I'll be the first
to acknowledge, are not the only or necessarily even the most valid
yardsticks), poetry doesn't seem to have much stature within the culture
AT LARGE at all.

& Personally, I didn't feel Joe was being so harsh & impolitic... but
then again, I can sympathize with his point of view, however much it is
true in the end that capitulations have to be made...

Came across a cd in the used bin yesterday, a collaboration

Hejinian (and another poet I can't remember). Has anyone
heard this? What's it like? Worth 8 bucks?

What's wrong with someone doing the whole award/nepotism thing?  This is a good
question.  I might try it myself if I could just get my desk organized &
if I thought I had the slightest chance in hell.  But there's something else,
some elusive thing that maybe keeps me from getting my desk so organized.
The feeling that the whole "system" is not a conspiracy but a sort of mindless
snow job.  It's the publishing/awarding/promotional/blurbing/gossiping/
circulating/name-dropping noise that is actually antithetical to what I
think of as good writing.  It's the commercial/professional/self-serving/
calculating/protection racket aspect that seems to have nothing to do with
the sense of literature as a criticism of life from deep within the most
refined, delicate, probing, honest, gifted corners of said life.  The sense
of the imagination as the greatest threat to sanctioned unjust complacencies -
and that careerism is the opposite of imaginative independence.  So that
I approach the "poetry shelf" in the bookstore in a bad and unreceptive mood,
and I blame the promoters for this (perhaps unfairly).  I fully respect
the canniness of artistic talent, its ability to consort with & dominate
commercial systems for its own benefit - yet canniness is not the skill
I care about in poetry.  So maybe I'm playing it safe & hypocritical by
demanding unreal standards?  I dunno.  I repeat Osip Mandelstam's maxim,
applicable to any age or society: "there are 2 kinds of literature - official
and unofficial.  The first is trash; the second, stolen air."  With the
caveat that there's a lot of trash in the unofficial camp too.  Literacy
are a mixed blissing.

It was a joke, man. I thought Joe was right on, but needs to cut down on
his caveats.

But let's play. Poetry has greater "stature" now that it has been
removed from the streets and resides in the academy which of course is
more respectable. This new respectability, largely a product of the
emphasis placed on civic values and the importance of one's own feelings
characteristic of the Neo-Georgian School, has encouraged people from
all walks of life to "make their little poems" as Rod Jellema is fond of
putting it. Ted Turner and Michael Milke(m) write poetry, as does
Secretary of Defense Cohen, Jeanne Kirkpatrick and Caspar Weinberger.
Former CIA Director William Colby published a collection of short lyrics
entitled Swimming Lessons published by Reader's Digest. The late, great
king of military psy-ops, Edward Landsdale is said to have attempted an
epic poem in the style of Vergil embracing the entire history of
Southeast Asia.

When I purchased part of Paul Linebarger's library, the author of
Psychological Warfare and one of iits major practitioners, I found
"little poems" dealing with the quaint domestic conundrums of life among
Washington's social set like whether he should sit Sukarno's widow next
to Richard Helms at a dinner party. These little literary bon mots, as
Michael Dirda of the Washington Post would undoubtedly describe them,
were wedged in the pages of books on techniques for psychological
torture, a technique in and of itself that would have intrigued Hannah
Arendt.

Whittaker Chambers was a poet as was Harry Truman's handler, Jimmy
Byrnes. A document recently released as FOIA #10345, reveals that 38% of
the veterans of the Phoenix Program published books of poetry (albeit
mostly with obscure vanity presses) within 10 years of termination of
service so convincing a technique among the criminally sanctioned has
been the Confessional School, the precursor of the New-Georgians. Norman
Schwarzkopf writes love sonnets and villanelles, a fact that would have
really upset his daddy, a former bagman for the DIA.

There are whole schools of poetry that I'm certain you know nothing
about. There is the Los Alamos School, the Richard Dailey Memorial
Democratic Machine School, the Pinkerton School, the Madison Avenue
School, the Hollywood School, the Manifest Destiny School, the Veterans
of Foreign Wars School (a big school; very sentimental), the School of
the Americas, the Chicago School, the Navy Seals school; I could go on
and on, ad nauseam. But they all have one thing in common; they write
like Gerald Stern. Now that's serious influence. That's "STATURE".

So how can you question poetry's current "stature". Bill Cohen can adopt
the liberal, do gooder ethos in a poem he's writing from his vacation
home on Monday and fly in on Tuesday just in time to have his handlers
tell him how to handle a lethal airstrike or police action. Poetry has
such incredible "stature" now because it's so flexible. You can say
nothing and insist you're doing it in the name of left-wing radicalism,
even Marxism. You can establish a white middle class, college educated
income between $27,500 and $78,000 per annum,
I'm-so-full-that-I'm-empty-I-have-to-tell-the-world-about-it profile for
poetry then uncritically apply it as a universal standard like "free
market democracies", "technological revolutions", "20% return on your
investments" and other such fictions. Christ, that fucker Robert Hass
did that very thing in his little, kitty litterature box in the Book
World of today's sad and sorry Washington Post The brutal, colonial
history of the Philippines was reduced to that Neo-Georgian sentimental
drivel and then praised and supported with whitey's prizes, fellowships
and grants; the same blood money that some of my friends here on the
list lust after. Read that poor pathetic excuse for a prize-winning poem
and you just smell the stench of oppression. "Returning a Borrowed
Language" or whatever the anthology is called, my ass. Can't wash all
those murders off with that Neo-Georgian technique. Doesn't wash of.
Can't even burn it off.

So Mark. That is what I mean by "stature". The power to be part of
murderous institutions and at the same time claim to be confronting
them. When I defended some elements of the social science community
Soakl, Gross & Levitt on this list, all I got was ignorant rancor which
amounted to a blind defense of those same institutions. In that case as
it turned out, the stink went right back to Richard Mellon Scaife and
other defenders of the money.

I'm reminded of the words of another poet here in Washington. The lapsed
Jesuit, misogynist, T.V. pundit John McLaughlin. Big Loud John once
said, "Whores? Whores!? We're all whores! But I'm the whore with the
T.V. show!!" See, all we lack is the fucking ratings.

Thanks, for the setup Mark. I got a migraine and can't read anyway.
As for Amato. I mentioned his name to The Family. I think he knows what
I mean. The Jimmy Hoffa School.

The disc is definitely worth it if you like Zorn's music, it's a very good
set of pieces from the mid-, late-1980s.  But if you don't like Zorn's
music, unless you're a totally obsessed collector of work by Hejinian or
Myung Mi Kim, I'd pass on it.

I don't have the disc with me here, so I'm only going on memory, but this
is a mid-1980s project called New Traditions in East Asian Bar Bands, a set
of three pieces each for a different pair of musicians and narrator. The
pairs of musicians are guitarists Bill Frisell/Fred Frith; drummers Joey
Baron/Samm Bennett; and keyboard players Anthony Coleman/Wayne Horvitz.
The writers involved are Lyn Hejinian, Myung Mi Kim, & Arto Lindsay, their
texts are translated into an Asian language: Kim's is translated into
Korean, Lindsay's & Hejinian's are in either Chinese or Vietnamese (I don't
remember who's is which).  The narrator's are not the writers, but are
native speakers of the Asian language to which the texts have been
translated.  The texts in English are provided with the disc, though, as I
recall, in very small print, often with difficult to read ink/paper
combinations (the packaging is quite elaborate).

When the disc came out (sometime in 1997, I think) I posted something that
was probably more detailed about it to the list.  You should be able to
find this by searching the poetics archives at EPC for mentions of Zorn.

Hope this is helpful.

Bests,

Herb

Hi Mark,

Maybe it doesn't come across, but I think *Harvard* would be losing out by not
having Blake, not Blake losing out not to have Harvard.

I'm not quite sure why people seem to think that academia is the only place for a
writer to make money--via grant or tenure. The job of *professional* may be
required for money, but the profession needn't be directly related to one's
personal writing. In fact, the lowering of standards that seems to be implied in
the pursuit of the writerly profession of grant-mongering & ass-kissing can be
avoided by pursuing a profession aside from one's writing. There seems to be great
resistance to this idea. Is it because people think all they can do is write? If
you can survive as a writer, you certainly have intelligence and skills that can
be parlayed into living wages. And the amount of money to be made in academia is
not particularly impressive--I don't understand why it seems so tantalizing to so
many.

Perhaps it's cynical or naive, but I'm kind of reassured by the fact that Blake,
Clare, Leopardi, Dickinson, Niedecker, et al., aren't Harvard-approved. It makes
me trust them more. The foregrounding of professionalism will continue as long as
universities are businesses, so maybe writers should quit looking at them as
employment services for writers.

The point might even be raised that it really shouldn't be writers teaching, but
*teachers*--alot of this discussion has been about writers complaining that
they're not getting enough of the academia pie: but who has said they're
frustrated because they feel they have something to offer as *teachers*?

Dear Charles Alexander:

Gosh, I hope you still remember me.  I'm still in Fukuoka, am happily
married--with a new addition--Delmore Yoichi--just tured one.  I wanted to
see if you might be interested in a manuscript of Cid Corman's--he has lots
of his own work, of course (New Directions will be coming out with a
selected in 2000.  (2000!  Incredible: I thought we'd all be flying in
personal space ships by now)--but he has one very interesting
manuscript--his translations of the Japanese poet Santoka--that's needs the
kind of home CHAX Press could provide.

I've also collaborated--with Cid, and other Japanese associates-- on a small
collection of translations of the poet Yoichi Kawamura--a personal friend,
and an important contemporary poet.  Sam Hamil--a friend of Yoichi's--may be
interesting in helping out on this one.

Finally--quite a while ago I'd mentioned a project based on the
SATOR/AREPO/TENET/OPERA/ROTAS magic square; Song for Arepo.  Part of it--but
actually only an early--and unfortunately a dammaged--part--is in the
archives of Grist.  This one I'd be interested in asking you to print
anyway, even if you wouldn't be interested in it for CHAX.  And of course, I
have the definitive MAN's WOWS.  I still thank you for that wonderful little
book that you did so many--too many--years ago.

If none of this interests you, no problem.  It's just good to be in touch.
I hope all's well with your wife's health, and your own life.  Take it easy,
Jesse Glass.

Any way, I hope this finds

I agree with you, Karen, but as a professional in a field pretty much
unrelated to writing, I can tell you that it can be a drain. I'd love to
spend more time writing and reading, but after 50-60 hours a week pushing
pixels, tweaking code and wrestling with management, there's not much
energy left to do much more than crash on the sofa in front of South Park.

Also, maybe I'm idealising the writing community, but it would be nice to
hang out with some people who have actually _heard_ of "Blake, Clare,
Leopardi, Dickinson, Niedecker et al". Though, come to think of it, 90% of
the writing community here wouldn't have heard of most of them either...

There's also the question of education: if you spend most of your life
learning about torts or aortas or depreciation or cumulonimbus, it doesn't
leave much time to learn about caesurae or metonymy or mesostics. It would
be lovely to devote one's life to writing and art, but Lagavulin don't grow
on trees.

Overall, though, I'm glad that I have a profession and interests outside of
writing: they inform and cross-pollinate one another. But we can't all be
polymaths, and they can detract from one another as well.

Another barrier might be the attitude of some within the arts community to
those who have mainstream careers. We're breadheads, geeks, yuppies,
corporate drones or dupes of the military-industrial complex. I once had a
brief relationship with a post-grad student. She'd read an essay of mine,
and after we'd been going out for a little while, she asked me where I
taught. When I said, no, I'm not an academic, I haven't even studied
English formally since I was 16, she replied (only half joking) "My God,
I'd never have gone out with you if I'd known you were a meteorologist!"

I too have a little more respect for the likes of Stevens, WCW or Holub
because they had careers outside of the word business. But it's bloody hard
taking yourself seriously as a writer when virtually no-one you work with
takes writing seriously. Which makes me all the more grateful for the few
of my friends who are writers, and of course for this list. Without it, my
work mailbox would have nothing but spam, Clinton jokes, and notes headed
"Your website is broke. Fix it."


        Can anyone tell that it's a Monday morning?

                Tom Beard.

I've always assumed that writers, as opposed to academics involved in
research, find academia appealing because it validates them and because it
can be a relatively easy way to make a living--flexible hours, long
vacations--and still write. Williams and Stevens, for two, had serious,
tough careers and managed to turn out reams of stuff, but not all writers
or writerly processes are made that way. The best idea is to marry up or
inherit money.
I often amuse myself imagining Melville (plug in your favorite
writer--Emily Bronte? Mark Twain?) at faculty meetings. .

I'm fond of the Zorn/Hejininian album, but I would neither recommend it
to Zorn fans (at least to the fans of Masada and Naked City) nor tell
people they should only listen to it if they are interested in Zorn's
more obscure album.  I think it was an under-rated album.  A set of "new
traditions" that didn't draw as much attention as Masada.  It's elegant,
has interesting instrumental arrangements, and is well. . . creepy.
Eerie like that earlier piece written for Kronos, "Forbidden Fruit."

At any rate. . . it isn't one of those off-the-cuff
recorded-in-an-afternoon with a duck call and a glass of water albums.
. . There's a lot of Zorn I regret having ever bought, but this isn't
one of them.

I'll be at the Laura (Riding) Jackson conference in Ithaca this week, staying
at the Hillside Inn (and still wondering where the events are!); then I'll be
in NYC on October 10 to join the book party for _Close Listening: Poetry and
the Performed Word_, edited by Charles Bernstein.  The event, as I gather,
will be at Double Happiness, 173 Mott Street, just south of Broome, from 4-6
pm.  I trust someone will get me a map...
Hope to see some listees in these places, as well as touches of autumn.
I'll be the one with the mostest jetlag, I trust.

Yup, but as used in this country--usualy misused--it comes from Winthrop's
sermon on the Arabella in 1630 before the first wave of Puritans hit the
shore (they had sent out a couple of ships in '28 and '29, but the Arabella
flotilla was the main group--a thousand settlers). Usually referred to as
if Winthrop had been saying that the Puritan commonwealth and its capitol,
Boston, would be the New Jerusalem, but in fact (as is perfectly and
uncontestedly clear in the text) he was issuing a warning: we're gonna be
like up on a hill where everybody can see us if we fuck up. The
misinterpretation, which goes back at least 150 years, speaks volumes.

        Now hold hard there, Gancieville! A J Sondheim writes "as if". I
can't hear his "I'm Arthur Rimbaud" as a self-aggrandizement, but rather as
the answer to the question "How do I know?"  I take AJS's poetic point to
be, that what's outrageous about Rimbaud's "Voyelles" IS just this, that
the fr poet is asserting himself as the ground of his k-edge--of the vowels
as of, potentially, everything. David

If i didn't live on an island without a liquor store, i'd have drunk myself
to death after that bp conference in Vancouver last weekend. It's a shame
that panel was the only one each of us attended but i think what Frank
Davey was trying to say was that he was sorry that all of the recent
focus(since bp died, 10 years) has been on the life long poem, the
martyrology, which lent itself to study when the radical, the empheral, the
enactment, were the even more important contributions to the discourse and
to us individually holding the door open for us as he did so many doors at
once, and tho i love the martyrology , i can't help but simpathize with
frank and daphne marlatt tried to tie the martyrology into her own
autobiographical work and family history, and fred
wah wasn't he saying he was more interested in being bp than anal eyezing
him. I was happy to see Ellie there she was looking fine fine as wine.
George Bowering, I hope John Cretin has the sense to appoint him to the
senate, or lieutenant governor, he should have his own television show,
nobody'd listen to Gsowski zzzzzzzzz.
I must confess, the architecture there creeps me out, it was tomblike, and
you got beer in a little room that looked like the basement of the police
station where they took your picture. It was like all these brains were
still playing in the garage forty years later.  There were some excellent
readings, lillian allen was excellent, she told a story about the jury at
the canada council which bp happened to be part of voting not to accept dub
poetry for the poetry grants program and bp threatened to go to the
newspapers so they changed their wicked ways and opened the door for
lillian allen and clifton joseph, dub poets, i almost went home before Genn
Lam? the twenty year old 6 foot asian canadian poet, wow, glad i stayed.
vagina both lillian allen and genn lam began their performances with the
same word vagina. sharon thesen and marja hindmarch agreed it was in
reference to bp's book of the body, organ music. Asok Mathur with his wacky
poem of Ganesh  born? in Calgary being interrogated by the gumshoe was
another treat. AnneMarie Harte Baker cybergranny she should have a teevee
show of her own
i've seen her for years but i never saw the charisma she has in
performance, claiming coyote back for the red? indians. the focus group,
sort of like a well behaved happening, they were cool, hipsters, kerouac
and bp would have dug them, i did.  Clint Burnham was as good as ever,
where was Lisa Robertson? where was Paul Dutton, or Rafael Barreta-rivera.
Jeff Derksen tried on Frank O'Hara and it was good, McCaffery was very
good, Judith Copithorne was right the geezers r us, she was the only
spontaneous performer who got the audience to make a poem of themselves,
Gerry Gilbert, Vancouver's Dante, was in fine form and appropriately the
ultimate reader of the night.
By and large i'll remember this conference as a shabby affair, you can't
call for papers two months before the event,  there should have been more
of an attempt to get the audience together, some food event or
availability, some beverages, some art show or dance,
there was little promotion, they were saving the posters to sell for
souvenirs,  no touch of Karen and Brian de Beck in this affair, no
attention or care for the details that Charles Watts might have provided,
only Renee Rodin mentioned Charles, dedicating  a poem to him,
what Frank was saying is more true here, but the martyrology is pretty
radical as far as american poetry goes, canadian poetry has had the
advantage of the influence and efforts of bp for thirty years  it doesn't
seem as radical to us, in canada the streets are paved with poetry, there's
a poet behind every chainsaw, every twelve guage, bp split the nucleus of
lingo, gave those phonemes more independence, graphemes, where was lionel
kearns, where was victor coleman, where was bill smith, this conference
could have gone on for a week, why was there no video of the proceedings(at
least the readings) they didn't expect much they got more than they
expected but it still wasn't enough, it felt ghoulish more important in the
resume than on the stage, like an academic mining claim, sadly. Margaret
Atwood probably didn't even know about it, she might have come. Speaking of
great canadian poets, Joni Mitchell has a new album out, they're not
playing it much here yet, anybody in cincinnati hearing it, anybody in
atlanta?

Billy,

Is Joni coming to Canada on the current tour?  I'm going to Mad. Sq.
Garden for the first time since 10th grade to watch her be a speck of
light a mile downslope.  Also, an article on her in this sunday's
nytimes ragazine.  Hightlights her antifeminism, I think unfairly, and
asserts some sort of unmanagable and insecure egotism on her behalf.
Poopoo to the writer, she is the genius she says she is.

Hi everyone, this is Kevin Killian.  To launch our books "Poet Be Like God:
Jack Spicer and the San Francisco Renaissance," and "The House that Jack
Built" (Jack Spicer's collected lectures), Lew Ellingham, Peter Gizzi and I
are having a double event in San Francisco.  This Tuesday October 6 City
Lights Books is having a book party for us (7:00 p.m.) . . . 261 Columbus
Avenue at Jack Kerouac Alley.

On Friday November 6 there will be a more elaborate affair in which many
who knew and worked with Jack Spicer, and who now find themselves
"characters" in our biography, will meet and read one poem apiece by
Spicer.  This event will be held at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, 701
Mission Street at Third Street in San Francisco; it's co-sponsored by Yerba
Buena Center for the Arts' "In Conversation Series" in conjunction with
their forthcoming exhibit "Ecotopia," and by Small Press Traffic, part of
its year-long examination of the "New American Poetry" anthology.  That's
at 7:30, seating extremely limited, call (415) 978-ARTS (Yerba Buena Center
Box Office) for more information--or watch this space.

So if you're in town on either of these nights, come on by and give me the
secret poetics list handshake . . .  Thanks, Kevin K.

The first event is the exhibition opening and reception on Thursday at
4:45, 2B Kroch Library, an underground architectural wonder which you enter

First, David, this is the Carlo Parcelli equation of the listing.
Second, of course you are right as far as interpretation dictates right
and wrong but the point I wanted to make was larger. At one moment we're
talking about the gains and inevitable losses of the poetry game vis a
vis grants, prizes and other such bullshit and the next minute Allan has
thrown on his little red riding hood cloak and offered a very well
hammered, oft revised, not spontaneous or off the cuff poem as an escape
hatch. I was left holding on to a scrap of A.'s lapel and I ran with
that. I don't want to critique in detail A.'s offering. Frankly, I liked
it. But Jenn/N. was in it and that had to become my hook to keep the
argument in line. Otherwise the tangents will wear your ass out. I wrote
all that shit on Saturday in my book store which was packed all day.I
had worked alone twelve hours on Friday and did another 13 hours alone
on Saturday. Close exegesis is not possible under those circumstances.
But gross considerations like grants and prizes are. Personally, I don't
like people who run and I really don't like it in poets. A. was clearly
hiding in his poem and I, having committed my time, felt compelled to
draw him out. 'Scuse me now I'm gonna go earn a buck.---Carlo

Is there a reissue of Donald Allen's _The New American Poetry_ planned?  I
don't mean the revised version called _The Postmoderns_; I mean the original
1960 book?  I thought I heard of such a thing (perhaps from California).
Can anybody give me information (release date etc.)?  Thanks.

Have been out of the loop(s) lately, trying to steer (forget "run," "manage," etc.)
a yearly writing conference with a writer's contest attached. Not only the contest
but the whole thing puts me in sick mind of the current discussion. Too many
enfeebled folks writing shaky checks to enter their couplets and quatrains and diary
notes; to sit in a workshop with a "renowned" writer they've never heard of without
even realizing they're entitled to bring a MS to be discussed; to meet agents who
think such things and such people are useful only for supplying a good laugh with
their pals; to catch some kind of magical spark that will turn them into Danielle
Steele. Etc. By the end of the conference (judged to be a "success") I was ready to
weep and moan, if in fact not publically weeping and moaning (but what is this?).
And this is a "good" conference, that has a solid group of regular attendees who
profess to benefit from the thing every year, who _thank_ me, and profusely, for
doing this for/to them. Meanwhile, I feel like judging again and again and again:
you--don't waste your money; you--don't waste your time; you--look in your heart and
write; you--grow up first; you--get a real job. Who'd be left? Not me.

As to the contest, this year (for the first time) we disallowed submissions from
anyone presently employed by or a student at this university. And that helped, at
least it helped me with what's left of my conscience. And though I wrung my hands
and sweated and cursed to find out that two of the best poets I know hadn't even
made the first cut in the poetry contest (yes, I peeked, because I'm the Director,
and I could), fate and the weirdnesses of readerly taste and judgment produced an
interesting mix of the "known" (V. Shipley) and "unknown" (but very fine, and not at
all "conventional"--Stella Brice) in that particular contest. And none of the
winners were known to any of the readers before the prizes were awarded.

And yet the whole thing still felt potluckish. (And what _that_ was was a "contest"
in which you submitted not your work but just your name, and they'd draw the winners
out of a hat [or a pot?] and then select some of your work to publish out of a
stipulated number of poems sent. And I thought it was a witty comment on contests
generally, and it certainly doesn't hurt anyone or anything: if it winds up
publishing someone undeserving, what doesn't? At least they'll be a different bunch
of undeservers.) I didn't read all the poetry submissions (or drama or novel or
fiction submissions), but I'm sure there were as many good ones chopped out as left
in, and I have little confidence that repeating the process would result in _any_ of
the winners or runners-up being selected again. Well, maybe this is all just
post-conference blues: omne animal triste est post conference.

I've had one book of poems published ("over the transom," as we like to say--I like
to think of jumping the transoms in the subway instead of paying), and won a few
awards, all "small," (though I was largely grateful for each one). None of them ever
involved anyone I knew, either by way of "invitation" or judging. Yet crookedness
seems epidemic. As (I think) Eliza McGrand said, there are an awful lot of us, so
some good, or at least honest, stuff does happen. The problem is to fend off the
nausea while you're doing it, if for some reason you feel a need to do it. (To write
it off as simple careerism misses the point of all those teenagers and old folks
who, as they say, submit.)

Anyway, from my point of view, it's a way of supporting small presses--if they'll
give me a year's subscription and don't publish their next-door neighbors on a
yearly basis, I'll send them fifteen bucks to read my poems. If I enter thirty
contests a year, I figure that's a nice piece of change for some people who
(thinking as generously as possible) _are_ deserving. And if I hit that lottery once
every three or four years, I come close to breaking even. I also occasionally hit
the tables at Grand Coushatta casino, in case anyone's wondering.

I'm not sure, though, that any such personal narratives are going to (as I'd hoped
when I started) add any kind of helpful context to this conversation. This list
always strains along the fault lines in poetry, sometimes strains till it bursts,
and to claim that one has had a few barely tolerable experiences with contests,
grants, etc., may be so much a signal that one has simply whored himself out to the
enemy that the experiences invalidate themselves. This is one problem with having
enemies who are in important ways your friends.

someone brought up the Zorn collaboration, so this isn't too off the
poetics subject I suppose...

two free concerts coming up at the library of congress:

               Cecil Taylor
               February 12th 1999

               John Zorn's Masada String Trio
               April 9th 1999

I don't know when the "free tickets" will be available for pick up, but
I'm sure they'll all go like the A.Braxton tickets earlier this year
(missed it and am still a little bitter).

Kevin -- sorry to have to miss the event! These two books brightened my summer
considerably. You -- & others on the list -- may enjoy the addition -- as of
this morning -- to the Eric Mottram website: I put up an audiofile (RealAudio)

21.  Practice thinking in complete sentences.  Do not write these down.

22.  Be a Platonic "name-giver" of the type described in the _Cratylus_.
Work at giving things their exact or "proper" names.  Then practice with
"misnomers."

23.  See if Wittgenstein was right:  try to invent a "private language"
for your sensations.

24.  Adopt a variety of social "identities" in your writing (race,
ethnicity, class, sexual identity).  However, avoid any explicit
"identifying" reference in the poem itself (e.g. don't use the word
"barrio" in your chicano poems).

25.  Invent a private slang (a la Lester Young); attempt to get as many
people as you can to use the words you coin.  Don't use these words in
your writing; rather, conceive of the invention of this language as an
independent poetic activity.

26.  Write "vocalese lyrics" to a recorded jazz solo.

27.  Practice speaking in blank verse as "naturally" as possible.

28.  Create your own avant-garde movement; make sure you officially
dissolve the movement after 6 months or a year.

29.  Invent an imaginary city, complete with geography, history,
architecture, prominent citizens, etc...  Keep a sort of "bible" of all
the information you compile.  Then write poems set in this city.

30.  Write nothing but sestinas and pantoums for a month.  Then
"cannibilize" them, using the best lines to write other poems.

I realize I'm coming to this late, & this isn't really geared to any
particular message, but I find it hard to believe that so much passion &
angst can be raised about grants, awards, contests, judges, etc. I mean,
I don't exactly see a connection between accumulation of money & improved
writing among poets who win anything.

Yes, winning $100 in a competition is not going to improve one's writing by
much, but getting a few grand for a grant, major award or fellowship could
let one devote a few months to writing, which should help a little bit.

And some people try to make a living from writing: a friend of mine does
so, and even a few dollars here and there make valuable additions to the
scraps of royalties, grants and review fees that she gets. I don't think
we're talking about "accumulation of money" in this case.

Even for poets with well-paying day jobs, a small award might help them
take their writing more seriously (as much due to the recognition as for
the dough), perhaps taking a month off to polish up a manuscript.

Is time bought to write better than time stolen or borrowed?  I'm all for
giving grants to poets, even though poets will write with or without them.
I admire the effort to piece together a living from poetry.

My idea was to become an academic (not in an English dept.) in order to
support myself as a poet. But I woke up one day to discover that I had
become an academic instead* of a poet. So about 10 months ago, about the
same time I joined the list, I redefined myself as a poet. I will still
write literary criticism in my "field" (and not in a perfunctory way) but
I have reverted back to my original plan. In fact this was a new year's
resolution. I have still not "come out of the closet" about this to
everyone I know; perhaps that is for 1999.

Some people believe that "Beauty is a rare thing / so few drink at its
fountain." According to this line of thinking you might have whole
centuries in certain countries where no good poetry is written. The
alternative is the idea that beauty is not at all rare. The best 100
Romanian poets contain all of poetry, so that someone knowing only
Romanian (or Finnish) could have a perfectly full life (poetically
speaking)  without knowing any other languages or relying on translations.
This was Borges' idea, and I believe it (or find it comforting) on some
level. So who votes for "rare beauty"  and who votes for Romania?

My best to all of you,

Jonathan

It's true that most of the monitors out there today won't give you
anything more than 72 dpi, but like everything else in the computer
industry screen resolutions will improve in time. And, depending on the
subject matter and your purposes, there may be archival value to
scanning the poetry at a much higher resolution, say 300 dpi. (This is a
common, indeed low-end, benchmark in the digital library community.)
You can always throw away information once you have it, but it'd be a
shame for the only record of someone's work to be a low-res. digital
facsimile. It all depends on your needs.

Not to nit-pick James's advice, just to offer another set of
considerations.

Also, it occurs to me that maybe a useful project/service for the EPC
would be to draw up a set of guidelines/recommendations for this sort of
thing? Matt

1) I vote for Romania. But that's not to discount the copious quantities of
un-great work in all media in all times.

2) The whole contest issue (I'm catching up on e-mails) is difficult. One one
hand, why condemn a judge who asks a friend or student whose work they like to
enter? And certainly, I can't condemn a student whose teacher or former
teacher likes his/her work. On the other hand, what a waste indeed to enter a
pre-determined contest. I believe it is the entrant's right and responsibility
to have some idea what kind of contest it is before sending in money and work.
And it's the judges' responsibility to do his/her job and read everything, not
just what they're predisposed to.

I came to the poetry world from the music world, which still seems much worse
to me. Contests -- and auditions -- are much more expensive (added costs such
as accompanist, clothes, transportation, the instrument itself, time to
practice) and rarely anonymous. In addition, your neighbors hate you. What a
joy to be able to write at 3 AM.

What we _really_ need is patrons. Wealthy, open-minded ones, and plenty to go
around.
And some substitute for sleep.

Still hmming,

I think that Romania has its own rare beauty, and while you could know
all of what the "100" "best" "Romanian" "poets" have to offer and thus
have a poetically albeit Romanianly full life, not knowing Finnish would
leave you bereft of everything that is Finnish and not Romanian.

what was Pound's remark about the tribe?  language is one of the things
that distinguishes tribes from each other.

I don't think there could have been a Borges in Spanish without Borges'
love for late Victorian English.  other examples are endless.

I'm arriving late into this conversation, but having known Rachel's writing
pre-Naropa, I have to second the fact that Rachel's poetics weren't
purchased in Colorado.  Look, Rachel has a mind.  She can think for
herself.  She's really creative.

I'm sure the same can be said about anyone on this list, although perhaps
not always quite as enthusiastically.

I'm very enthusiastic about Rachel's poetics.  I'm also very enthusiastic
about Rachel's performance which, yes, is full of energy, which--in my
book--is a big compliment.

Did anyone ever consider that rolled eyeballs are a response to a
lackluster performance?

Does ANYONE really want to be pigeonholed?

On that note, I don't agree with Rachel that her work is, in fact, totally
didactic.  It moves me.  It's not totally anything, thank goodness.  Isn't
anything that is totalizing totally frightening?

Why would anyone apologize for their own didacticism, or their own
anything, for that matter?

Wouldn't it be refreshing to just read the work as best we can and let the
audience think and groove for themselves?

May all the world's rhetorical questions cut like icebreakers through so
much poetic rhetoric,
betsy

Report


Cisco Systems advertises the worldwide economy, stating that every fourth
person on the Web is buying something right now; Cisco Systems has a stake
in those numbers signing up every second. IBM has a stake in a shrinking
world with technological solutions for everyone representing national
characteristics easily recognizable as other. Wired talks about the world
coming together presumably with good old boy American know-how and exper-
tise. Pipelines are beginning to flow with promises of the Next Big Thing
which turned out not to be push technology - so it wasn't quite time to
throw away your browser. Anger builds even among those who are franchised,
watching from the plateglass window. Net art engorges on itself; the poli-
tics of talk replaces the talk of politics. Caress the wires with bigger
seductions than old-fashioned pyramid schemes or other blunders; spam has
already caught on, delivering more and more personal messages tailored to
our vulnerabilities. Hacking has become both commonplace and preposterous
as political; while the altered symbol or webpage makes big news, nothing
happens except some league scores points for itself on IRC. Starvation and
homelessness are hardly virtual, and what really goes down those pipelines
are encrypted orders for nuclear fuel wallowing around the marshes of the
old USSR - don't doubt it for a second. The reordering of the world has
already begun, and won't be stopped by hackers or cultural works carving
out territories of speech, manifesto, and protest. Better pack your bags,
and I have just the website for you - order your luggage now. - Jennifer

Report on Not Taking a Weatherman


It doesn't take much to see the biochemical and nuclear demise of the
world as we know it; the crust will survive, some lifeforms. The human
cultural process might be nearing its end, strangled by those very wires
supposed to bring us all together. Virtual ghosts rise in the nodes;
routers are concerned with passing emissions that don't quite fit the
definition of packet. Sometimes the wires themselves end up coated with
ectoplasm, remnants of beings not-quite-us traversing the skein. I'd say
pull out, but the increasingly fine mesh or raster ensures that pullout's
impossible; even our local outer space isn't immune from ranked orders
skittering back and forth, taking ghostly emanations with them. Oddly-
shaped noctiluminescent clouds fill the sky; lavender-orange lightnings
dance with the usual strokes. The stars are certain to keep their counts
with everyone watching with wide-field telescopy. You have to be a sensi-
tive to hear the murmurs in the air, subterranean sounds emitted by a very
dangerous future far too close at hand. It's not only the viruses, the
small bombs, the landmines, the worthless currency - it's not even the
principles of the _thing_ which begins to darken ontology itself. It's
what's always surrounded us, what's always been invisible - it's the
plague of avatars, seminal disturbances - you can't quite figure them into
the equations, can you. It's not what the hacker did; it's what the hacker
didn't mean to do, and it's what the gun thought and the bomb pondered.
And it's not the hacker, nor the man with the trigger; it's the vapors in
the air, it's what the animals do, what the plants are thinking of doing.
When we are loose, we are very very loose, and when we are bad, we are
bad in deed. - from Julu, buried beneath the ground

Multiculturalism's a lie; you can't reconstruct yesterday even in your own
country. Giving you a spectrum of cultures and histories is just that -
more theories, words, commodities, tourisms, "appreciations." I DON'T WANT
TO BE APPRECIATED - I want to be seen as other, to be incomprehensible,
just like you are to yourself, like you should be. All translation is a
lie, mistranslation; the only thing we understand together is the movement
of missiles from one country to another, either by land, or by air - armed
- on fire - coming on fast. There's no escape; nobody wants to admit to
radical incomprehension; more than ever, the world's supposed to be one
big book, admittedly of many languages, but the smile of Manunkind behind
them all. I, Daishin Nikuko, refuse to be part of all of this; I'll go
down with the rest of you - my physiology's the same, but not much else.
You won't even understand my final words, even if you could speak the
language. There's no language big enough for any of us. I look at you and
see: strangers. I look at myself and see: strangers. I'm the last honest
person - and you won't understand that either - I'm the only one who knows
that the world's expanding, not contracting - making way for the Big Deal
that will kill us all. - Daishin Nikuko

Report from Appearance


It's clear that universal psychosis is setting in, in both the metaphoric
and literal senses; I can no longer perceive the difference between myself
and my avatars, let loose on my unsuspecting miniature world. Do not, for
an instant, doubt that this is yours as well; that we are all losing Soul
and Substance day by day, hour by hour, second by second. Fantasms begin
to rule everywhere, to speak where others have spoken before - to speak as
if others had no voice, no memory, no history. They're differentiated from
the rest of us by ectoplasmic secretions, by states of continual arousal,
by shadows blurred by penumbras of indefinite extent. They are fed by acid
rain, noise splattered across satellite dishes, stratospheric gouges
permitting deadly rays to reach the surface of the planet. I am real and
they are more real than I am. "I am" is a front for them. And they might
ask me to say that if it were psychosis, I would not be allowed to speak,
and if it were psychosis, there would not be these _true-scientific_ and
_exacting-logical_ processes, observable by everyone: these atmospheric
flows bringing contagion of cold money and soft flesh, suppurations and
information wars, harsh words made from harsher constitutions. For acids
shall not erase them, nor magnetic fields dissolve their innate beings, as
we have known from certain experiment. We are spent-nuclear; "we are a
poor troupe, hardly suitable for your entertainment, and we dance from,
not to, our graves. La la la la la." Need I add that I'm forced to speak
like this, because of our ingracious _medium?_ - Alan

California is definitely bringing this out, with the addition of a new essay
by Don Allen. The date is still not fixed. 1998 is POSSIBLE; 1999 seems a
shade more likely.

Not to sound immodest, but being in the second year of a Stegner
fellowship, I'd like to weigh in here.

The chief benefits have been:
1.  Enabling me to move to the Bay area.
2.  Allowing me the time to volunteer with Small Press Traffic and do some
decent work for them.
3.  Allowing me the opportunity to live on a part time job in one of the
more expensive parts of the country.
4.  Access to a nice fat university library and plenty of time to read.
5.  A foothold back into the academic world (especially being allowed to
teach college classes and middle school students, especially being able to
sit in on some pretty interesting classes and not have to pay for them).
6.  Time to write.  Time to write.  Time to write.

Considering I was working as an office temp and a proofreader for an
accounting firm reading audit reports 40 hours a week prior to getting this
fellowship, I'm more than grateful for all the opportunities it's given me.

Granted, I was able to do most of those things I listed as benefits while I
lived in Chicago and had a day job.  But believe me, things are a lot
easier with a fellowship than without one.  There should be more of them.

The reason people claw over grants and awards isn't because of a desire to
accumulate money, they just want to accumulate time.

While I do not consider someone's being an academic to be in any sense a
tragic loss of human potential, I found myself doing a spot of cheering and
arm-waving on reading this. WELL DONE!

And let the closet open as it lists, there's a balance between being
upfront and inflicting snippets of biography on innocent bystanders.
(Though this remark is I suppose a piece of stray autobio on my part. I
kept zipped about writing poetry for years, then when my daughter went to
school I realised that the very best publicity firms should be entirely
staffed by five year olds.)

PS your exercises are really smoking!

Yes, a great idea. If anyone is interested in working on such a set of

This is a real good deal perhaps someone here can use it. I know of one
ISP that is offering free monthly internet access however they require a
one time fee of their software($99) and a one time fee for set-up($20).
After that it's 100% free unlimited access. They currently have 1,000
cities on-line with over 300 pop sites. Check to see if your city is
listed on their web site

Jumping in ahead of Anselm b/c question is juicy: no, I don't see a
connection.  At least not one consistent enough to hang an argument on.
I'll take one O'Hara lunch poem over fifty thousand poems produced at
Yaddo (apologies to all list-members/yaddo-attenders).  My own experience
says that poems produced on the run, over a cup of coffee and a
cheeseburger, or in the car during a conversation, or in the half-hour
between classes, or on one's employer's computer when supposedly working
on the Smuckers account, often come out better and more interesting than
the one built on "emotion recollected in tranquility."  Now, of course,
you can be worked to death in detriment to your poetry, but that
stereotypically European sense of "why doesn't the culture support its
artists by giving them great amounts of "free" time to produce their great
works - well, I don't know, it just doesn't seem to play out historically
when I take account of the writers I really love - I think of Williams and
his magic dashboard & prescription pads!  Now that's writing!   -m.

Subject:      money time equation (p=m/t ^2)?

money vs. time... o.k., i'll bite.  i've thought about it aLOT.  some of
thoughts:

1) there seem to be an awful lot of writers who write something extraordinary
while working as busboy in hotel, dr., indian chief, etc.  they get gobs of
glam and recog.  and... nothing else.  ever.  or, worse...

2) geschmutz.  dreckda.  ptheewww!  or not even, just mediocre, dull, navel
mesmerized wordlumps.  was it the money?  the recognition?  the sudden rapt
world attention (think of those pale, thin, knobby child-stars who freeze
when they get in the Big Shoe...) -- a case of stage fright?

3) but there are people, nice people, with ordinary, struggling lives
we all relate to (can i pay rent this month?  oh dear god, please let
it not be the transmission, please let it not be the transmission...)
who write book, it sells, they get globs of money, and they... KEEP ON
WRITING.  as well, or better.  sue miller springs to mind, quite
probably because she is our local wunderkinder.  she bought, i've
heard, a house with the windfall from "the good mother" and after
years of nomadic bostonian rentpoor existence, who can blame her?  who
among us does not envy?

4) there have been a few times in my life when i've had sudden globs of
time on my hands.  was i more productive?  i have to say, no.  turn it
around: when was i MOST productive?  when i was getting poleaxed with
something i wanted to write, when i was on a writing streak which, we
all know, has something to do with moon in jupiter or pluto in mars or
five countries beginning with "A" all putting a highway in the NW part
of capital city in same week, or... who knows.

5) would money/prizes/recognition have changed, helped, etc. say, DURING
a writing streak?  don't know.

6) would money etc. help now?  SURE!  i have DEBTS i would have much peace
of mind if i could pay.  i would like a house.  i would like to, finally,
travel.  would it help my WRITING?  don't know.  it would give me more
subject matter.  fewer excuses not to write.

7) side effect of contest/prize/etc not mentioned yet is the automatic
accept thing.  you send your work in over the transom as howard unknown,
and you stand good chance of shitpiling.  you send your work in as howard
i-won-X-famous-prize, they'll take, maybe without really reading, just
because, well, howard i.w.x.f.p MUST be good, after all, he won that prize...
wouldn't i like to have more authority, more publishability?  SURE!  would
it help?  well, i'd get more work out, but would i be disciplined enough not
to take advantage of it, send out bad work without waiting to know if it really
is good and then it gets published and then, months, years later, i cringe and
regret?  don't know.  but bottom line is:

8) we write to get read.  .  whatever advances that, maybe it is a
good thing taken as a whole.  but do we have to get read while we are
alive?  what if we write like blazes, sans glam, and then get read
like anything when we are dead?...

9) look, i don't know.  don't think anyone knows.  but i can look at what
we HAVE, and i do think rigged contests are dishonest and dishonorable.  one
can, ultimately, protest the dishnonest and dishonorable only by not agreeing
to be part of them.  but laura (who says we ought to KNOW about contests),
how do we KNOW if they are dishonest?  it isn't always as blazingly
apparent as, say, the National Library of Poe-(sucker born every minute)-EH-
try (try try again).

ok, my too-long fifty cents...

Subject:      The 4th decade of experiments
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

31.  Write a poem without irony.

32.  These experiments involve (a) constraints, (b) bringing poetry into
the world--breaking down barriers, (c) de-familiarization, or (d)
obsessiveness or mania.  Formulate an excercise that does something else.

33.  Treat a pre-existing poem in "free verse" as though it were a fixed
form.  Reproduce the pattern of syllables and accents in your own poem.

34.  Watch the sky for a predetermined period each day, keeping a journal
of your observations.

35.  Translate a poet's work into the foreign language that you know best;
write poems directly in this language.

36.  Write a hundred poems and rank them in approximate order of
excellence.  Whenever you write a new poem allow it to "challenge" the
existing poems for a place on the list.  Do this until all original 100
have been replaced.  Start over again, this time choosing an altenate
"standard" of value or rejecting value judgments altogether.

37.  Write a poem of any length.  Then replace every line with a variant
that is functionally equivalent (in any way you decide).  Keep going until
you have at least 10 complete sets of variants.  You will have either 1
perfect poem (the best variants for each line), 10 poems, or "100 billion
poems" a la Queneau (all possible permutations: 10 to the nth power where
_n_  is the number of lines in your original poem.)

38.  Compose the worst possible poem you can; read it at all poetry
readings you give until someone points out to you how dreadful it is.

39.  Write bitter invective (but as side-splittingly funny as possible!)
against any target of your own choosing.

40.  Start writing political poetry of the most explicit sort possible,
but make it as "well-written" as possible--whatever this means for you in
this context.

I was holding back from this discussion but I too have recieved grants
in the past and I have always gotten them as special favors to me in
other words as straight economic and political quid pro quos. The best
deal was the one I struck with Exxon right after the Valdez spill. They
had just initiated their POETS, VOX POPULI campaign and you can bet your
sweet ass I wanted a taste of that $440,000,000.00 pot. I had provided
some forged end user certificates to a group of mercenaries in Angola to
purchase weapons for Savimbi, so the boys at Exxon, who were trying to
shove out Gulf, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell in the region, owed me
one. But to get my grant money, I had to fuck the entire board of
directors and their chauffeurs. Actually, this wasn't so bad because
those suits are really in touch with their bodies. Anyway, that's my
confession. I hope you won't think any less of me.---Carlo Parcelli

Hi all,

Just came across a book of limericks written by Isaac Asimov and John
Ciardi.  I am dumbfounded by this collection and am left speechless, but
it got me wondering if there have been any so-called language-centered
limericks, or if any of you have attempted to write in this form or even
break the form but still keeping the "essence of limerick" (a new
cologne?).

I've attempted a few but am reluctant to post them.  (I'll wait to see
if anybody else has any...)

P.S.  alright, here's mine:

Might explain why you only have one favorite poet, too.  Have you been
experimenting with this historical model lately?  Practicing a little
obstetrics on the fly while delivering poems?

Ah, you missed my mentioning of O'Hara: I have been having lunch on the
fly! and my wife has been practicing obstetrics on the fly.  Is that close
enough?  And need I go through the many working folks on this list whose
poems I love, poems, indeed, written on the fly?  -m.

@).  Just want to thank everyone on the list who did cite, frontchannel
and backchannel, particular instances in which a judge chose either a
student or a friend.

#).  I think it's important to understand not only why this occurs and
what its implications are, but _how often_ it happens.

$).  I don't think it's particularly helpful to _criticize_ the phenomenon
-- but that could just be me.  On the other hand, knowing _about_ it
(rather than simply _of_ it) and chatting openly about it might, somehow,
help the situation.   Thanks again, be well. -- Gabriel Gudding

tried writing on the fly but the little bugger kept wriggling away from me
-- then tried writing on the money itself, thus getting far greater
criculation than by the book -- new, enlarged Andrew Jackson affords an
improved surface for short forms --


the letters between Williams and Marcia Nardi provide a good couterpoint to
this theme --

Depends, obviously, on the poet and the poem. Retirement gave us a
different Williams, the one who wrote Desert Music and Journey to Love. My
own experience, since I was able to chuck the 9 to 5, is that my work
changed--perhaps not for the better (that's not my call), but different in
interesting ways--although I was always pretty adept at writing on the run
and still do, mostly. In a perfect world every poet would be able to have
the environment that best nurtures his poetry of the moment. It won't
happen, but it's nice that some can manage to get grants or colony
fellowships when they need them.

I've been to both Limerick and Cologne. I know Cologne, and I can tell you
that Limerick is no Cologne.

You might want to check out Gershon Legman, _The Limerick_. 5000 (yup, all

>Depends, obviously, on the poet and the poem.
Now take a guy like me. I always write better when money worries are few,
as they are definitely not right now, and if they are not then I always
write better when I'm in the country, as I have been for the past few
weeks (did you miss me?) where there are fewer money worries even if you
don't have any money because it's much less expensive to live out in the
country. Also, who can worry about money when there's a sky full of
galaxies and the Milky Way to gape at most nights, and a horizon in all
directions to gaze at, and cows to admire for their serene devotion to
duty.
Actually I work much better in the country. There are fewer distractions,
even those nervous ones of a self-induced nature. It's astonishing, after
being city-bound for so long, to find myself working on a poem for an
unimaginable number of hours, and pleased as all get out to be doing so.
To get that effect in the city one has to have on hand a ready supply of
certain prescription drugs, Dexedrine for instance, which itself is a
drain on cash supplies.
One night I was watching the sky and a cloud swam away to reveal Sirius
shining splendidly, and just then a dog started barking ten miles away.
Honest!
So, my conclusion: the city is fine for dashing off a line here and there,
whilst nervously pacing in your little cage and worrying about the rent,
or rushing off to deliver another baby, but the country is the place to be
when it's time to put those lines together into something destined for
immortality.
But that's just me. No wish to cause a mass exodus from our wonderful
urban centres.
Then again, the city is just the same as the country except for a greater
number of buildings, and more streets, and more cars, and more people, and
fewer cows and fewer trout streams.
As former poet and natural historian Christopher Dewdney once said, the
country is just the city with a larger grid.

How about looking at the books that have won in the past? Getting info from each
other on lists like this? Passing on info to friends if you find a good one (or one
to avoid)? Not entering if you can't afford to lose? And never expecting to win
anything. Contests are gambling, with pretty bad odds. I still think we need
wealthy benefactors or at least affordable housing, not contests, to solve
financial woes.

I see the connection Chris, & I think it's valid tho' still dependent on
who the person is & how they work, etc. & I think grants are nice if you
can get them but I also think it's a waste of energy to give it much
thought. I guess, actually, the real problem I see is a community(ies) of
writers giving off the impression that some degree of outside funding is
essential to getting their work done. The actual writing. Of course, a
poet who, say, owns a car could actually sell the car instead of applying
for a grant & thereby stop spitting exhaust into the air while having
time to write, reflect, edit, etc......

Now that the Starr report is out, and the worst is known, I've been hoping that congress would take swift action and then move on with the business of the country. But it seems our representatives are settling down for a long process, and I'm not sure I can stand it. Worse, I'm not sure the country can stand it.

I'm helping launch an Internet campaign to tell our representatives that we've had enough. The President should receive censure from the Congress and we should all move on. And the independent counsel investigation should end. It's time for the public interest to come first, and for our representatives to show real leadership.

Will you help? Just go to http://www.moveon.org to sign the petition. It only takes a minute. And then if you send a message on to your friends and colleagues, the ball will really get rolling. It's up to us.

Please feel free to forward this message to anyone you think would be interested. Don't send this message indiscriminately.  Spam hurts the campaign.

The very same. He's the great folklorist of smut. A lot of the limericks

The only rhyme I could come up with is "smegman."

Hey listees, I'm back from the land of nomail, and was curious about what
seems to me to be a gratuitous instance of Canada bashing (i.e. the
Richard Ford quote).  that said, when I see Richard Ford, I reach for my
revolver (in his textual, not corporal, guise), so perhaps I have jumped
to conclusions (off the Peace Bridge).  surely, O Canada can rightfully
look down on the governing antics of these United States of Amerrorica.

Hello folks,

I'm new to the list as of today.

But, I had to get in on the limerick....

Once there was a scholar named Legman
Whose vocation, he'd claim, was a "smegman"
His cheese he'd collect
bathroom wall's, he'd dissect...

Right on, but it doesn't make it any less frightening for us. Maybe more
so in fact.
By the way, there is a lot of Canada-bashing in that particular book. A
journalist friend who interviewed him when he was up here asked him about
it, at my request, and according to her he didn't have much of an answer,
in fact seemed a bit uncomfortable about it. He even has nasty things to
say about hockey!!!

our "Legman" limerick is, if you'll forgive me, starting off on the wrong
foot -- unless you're actually going to pronounce "there" with an unusally
pronounced emphasis -- need to switch to "There once . . ."  though, as
always, regional variations in emphasis may have their way with meter --

Agreed, but I would like to attach a Rider requiring Henry Hyde to
elaborate on his notion that there is a statute of limitations governing
what he thinks is moral conduct.

I mean, doesn't God keep track of all one's sins in a big book? And isn't
Henry Hyde currently playing God? Does God's ink fade with mere time? These
and other questions I should like to hear H Hyde debate. Perhaps with Pat
Buchanan.

I also want the details about what his paramour and Hyde, that sly dog, did
together. No telling what of use one could learn.

Actually, I rather like Canada, especially the weather, despite an early
unfortunate marriage to a Torontonian, which I don't always blame on the
country at large. I do think that that marriage gives me the same
disparagement rights as a native, however. I will say just one word, the
import of which anyone familiar with echt Quebecois culture will recognize
immediately: "poutine."

Well. . .no. . . I think marrying into a profession is a fine thing for
a writer. . .quite another thing from having a profession.  If you
aren't working after all. . .you can still write poems "on the fly" if
you want.  I don't have anything particularly against spontaneous
poems.  (I have however been writing more prose lately, so I am biased.
It's hard to write a short story on the dashboard).

And I think there's probably a lot of professions involving flies that
are a great source of inspiration.  My parents are drosophila
geneticists, so I grew up around fly-obstetrics, though usually the odd
jobs relegated to me had more to do with fly-autoclaving.  Believe me,
plenty of grim, yeasty, teenagerish sorts of poems that year.  Poems
with legs.  And antennae.

But I wouldn't say that Williams or O'Hara could be called a historical
model.  I also don't think it's "work-time" itself that's an issue so
much as the type of work you can acquire. . . Delivering children (or a
plague of insects) has a certain dramatic appeal, but its hard to get
jobs in separate competitive fields (writing, medicine, etc.)   In the
mean time, a lot of us take up work in "something related to writing,"
and this is what interests me:  these jobs suck the life out of you.
Academia is good if you can get it, but it isn't good if you get four
classes in freshman composition for 22,000$ a year.  Last summer, I
tried out tech writing which pays better, but at the end of the a day
writing instruction manuals for vaporware, you don't come home and want
to write. You don't want to read.  You don't want text anywhere near
you.   You don't even want to watch TV because it has credits and those
little logos in the bottom corner.  You want to take up something like
cooking.  Maybe Indian cooking.  Something you can eat.  Something that
reminds you that your brain is connected to your stomach.

So what do people think are "good jobs for writing?"  As opposed to the
"good jobs for writers"?

Up until last September when I was made redundant, I was a ghostwriter of
books for a publishing company spun off of a consulting company. I hated
it, but the pay was good and the hours ridiculously easy. And no, I did
not write more, but no less either. Now, I work half-time for an arts
agency as a grantswriter. It's finally work that I can mostly believe in.
The agency is actually a theater troupe consisting primarily of people
with mental illness (schizophrenica, depression, manic depression, DID,
etc.) who put on short sketches about the experience of having a mental
illness. Much of the work is quite satirical, attacking hospitals and the
psychiatric profession, drugs and their side effects, etc. The job does
not pay real well. My other half-time job is at a boating magazine. I
compile an events calendar, the Local Notices to Mariners from the
Coast Guard and a monthly collection of reports of drug arrests, BWIs
(boating while intoxicated) and search and rescues (some pretty
dramatic) which I also get from the Coast Guard. It's not the type of
work that I can believe in or not, but I do like the people I work
with. It don't pay so great either. And so, I have the experience
of some here -- job satisfaction or relative satisfaction but no time for
much else than worring about money.

Ee-yew...fly-*autoclaving*...

Well, to prove the everyone-has-different-tastes theory: I am now (for the
past 3 years) happily ensconced in a tech-writing/desktop-publishing job at
a computer software company & adore it.

I always found teaching utterly exhausting; I would be a pile of nerves
while preparing lectures, then have this exuberant post-class adrenaline
rush with eventual dramatic crash. It was *way* too emotional for me.

Meanwhile, the world of high tech publishing lets me play with words and
images all day, many of which I am curious about but not overly-attached
to--and at the end of the day I am thrilled to see poetry & fiction.
Provided nothing's misspelled: the proofreader habit doesn't quit after an
8 hour day.

And as an aside on the beg-borrow-or-steal time issue: no matter how much
or how little one has, if there are kids in your life, you are continually
"on the fly."

Subject:      the sense of being right

As an alternative to the "poetry & money" jive, here's a very discussable
paragraph - especially in the context of pervasive "language" based
"avant-garde" postmodernisms in poetry today:

   "The question whether something is 'right' or 'wrong' in a given historical
framework displaces the epistemological question whether something is 'true'
or 'false'.  Thus it may very well be that a subject does not first 'mean'
something that it subsequently expresses through language (which thus would
be reduced to a tool available to us).  It may also be "that, rather than
being master of an 'objective' world above which it stands, consciousness is
instead an effect of social and unconscious processes which it could never
fully 'know' or control; that all models that provide general explanations
of the world are to a certain extent theoretical fictions."(*) But this does
not contradict the necessity of discussing literary texts as representative
texts, as models of human behavior, and as participants in the constant
struggle for interpretive power within society.  If anything, an overemphasis
on epistemological questions prevents us from seeing that the literary media
and the public spheres of cultural production are to be highly prized socially
because they make it possible for individuals to work through their material
experiences and understand them as 'consciously' as they can."

here would undercut the basic "theoretical" rift between "mainstream" poetics
and "experimental" poetics, in the US at least.  Poetries that maintain the
autonomy and otherness of artistic language would be seen as more reactionary
than progressive in a political sense, as upholding stable relations between
art (as an autonomous sphere unable to impact on "reality") and society.
This in itself is neither right nor wrong; but one would have to reconsider
what we want to call "experimental" in a social sense - obscure speech,
or "interpretive" speech, in the sense Schulte-Sasse outlines here.

I don't want to pretend I'm saying anything new here - it's just new to me.
That is I've leaned in this direction but haven't found it put so clearly
before.

Okay, here's an obscure question for you.

In was quite surprised to find out that Robert Duncan's essay "Towards
and Open Universe" was read by Duncan over the air, broadcast by the
Voice of America.  Does anyone know whether there is a recording of this
broadcast?  If so, where can I find it?

Best,

Bob

"Stop! What's that Sound?"
University of Iowa symposium on improvisation and composition in the arts
Thursday, Oct. 15 through Saturday morning, Oct. 17

Readings, panels, a concert, and open multi-arts improvisation sessions
with Lyn Hejinian, Clark Coolidge, the Rova Saxophone Quartet, and painter
Tom Soule.  Discussions of interrelationships among music, poetry and
painting, panels on the role of improvisation and crossdisciplinary
approaches to composition.   All events free and open to the public.

For the Oct. 16 concert, Rova will play a combination of original works by
members of the quartet and works commissioned by Rova with funds from Meet
the Composer USA Commissioning Fund.  The program includes pieces from
"Freedom in Fragments," a long suite written for Rova by Fred Frith, which
the quartet will record in 1999.  Rova's influences include Ornette
Coleman, Thelonious Monk and Anthony Braxton, Charles Ives, Olivier
Messiaen, Ianis Xenakis, and John Cage.   A leader in  "collective
improvisation,"  the merging of composed and improvisation music, "Rova is
not only the hardest-working saxophone quartet in blow-business," says the
San Francisco Chronicle, "they are also the finest."

As listers will know, Lyn Hejinian began publishing her poems in magazines
in 1963 and 1964.  By the mid-1970s, she had begun editing the Tuumba Press
series, which included a wide range of contemporary writing by poets and
critics.  Among her major publications are "Gesualdo," "Writing Is an Aid
to Memory," "My Life," "Oxota: A Short Russian Novel," "The Cell," and "The
Cold of Poetry."  She is co-editorof the Poetics Journal with Barrett
Watten .  Her critical essays are forthcoming from the University of
California, Berkeley.

Clark Coolidge's poetic career spans 33 years and an almost equal number of
books.  A jazz drummer himself, his collections of poetry include "Solution
Passage: Poems 1978-1981," "Sound as Thought: Poems 1982-1984," "Own Face,"
and "The ROVA Improvisations," which began as preparations to compose liner
notes for Rova's album "The Crowd."  David Antin calls Coolidge's
improvisatory constructions "the work of an experimental master doing a set
of brilliant takes on the convention."


       THURSDAY, OCT. 15

        10:30 a.m.      "Sound as Thought as Poem": Poets Lyn Hejinian and

I've been trying to stay out of the debates of late, but this one gets
my goat. This is not to say that Henry (or anyone) is not allowed their
personal taste-- but to suggest that "experiments" NECESSARILY
constitute gimmickry is at best shortsighted. (Let alone to suggest that
the best poets who make use of them cannot tell the difference between
weak, inauthentic or "authentic" poems, regardless of the trivial
question of HOW they were written).  I think the poetry of Bernadette
Mayer or Jackson Mac Low is extremely AUTHENTIC; beside it, quick a lot
of "nonexperimental" verse is shown up for the "personal voice" gimmick
it is (or can be)...

It seems to me, Henry, that you jump top the conclusion that
Schulte-Sasse'sideas are not applicable to an experimental aesthetic.
This jump can be separated into 2 mistaken leaps of faith: 1) that
"experimental" is somehow equal to "autonomous"; and 2) (related) that
experimental writing can't/doesn't engage/communicate with  "the public
spheres of cultural production."  Which is to say that experimental
language is not communicable langauge.  I don't think this is true in the
least.  In fact, I would go so far as to state the oppposite: that a
*purely* traditional speech/language (if there was such a thing, which
there isn't) wouldn't communicate at all, since communications is not a
matter of reiterations but of adjustments, responses, antagonisms,
ameliorations.  Paul Goodman has said, in discussing the poetic
avant-garde, "Poetic speech which drastically alters the code communicates
better than ordinary speech - one has to give into it to get something out
of it."  What Goodman means (he explains it in great detail) is that a
certain lack of familiarity w/ the code with which one is presented is the
prerequisite to dialogue, & to the on-going assembly of new communities.
Otherwise, why talk at all.  I find this true of any poem which doesn't
in one way or another (and there are many, many ways to do it, some which
most of us wouldn't call "avant-grade") try to alter our sense of what a
"poem" is by sugesting what it *might* be: it never really enters the
social sphere, the public sphere, b/c it simply lies down like an
identical transparency on what's already there.

Mike, your points are well taken.  But I was not arguing against experiment
per se.  I was trying to redefine what IS really experimental.  Or mumble
in that direction.  This quote from "Theory of the Avant-Garde" (intro)
is like skimming the surface of a very longwinded & complex debate
that Burger's book addresses (think of those names: Marcuse, Adorno,
Jameson... enough to send shivers up your spine). I haven't read them
either. (I know some of you HAVE!!)
   Nor is Schulte-Sasse rejecting "experiment" per se.  But he's talking
about 2 contrasted aspects of language use - a philosophical
skepticism of the ability of literary language to convey truth, as
opposed to a more historical sense of literary language as ONE kind
of communication within existential realities in which
justice - the sense of right & wrong - is a present actuality.  &
I was trying to contrast two tendencies - I know this is a grid &
that things cross over the grid (Jordan?) - one that, say, deconstructs
bourgois reality "to infinity", and "representation" & "everyday speech"
etc. along with it; the other, that values representation as a
communicable interpretation of real situations.  So I would agree with
Goodman, I guess, but I wouldn't say flatly that "poetic speech which
drastically alters the code communicates better..." etc.  It's a
continuum, a two-way street.

- just another version of stuff I've been saying (ad nauseam to many)
on the list for years...
- Henry G.

I agree, not surprisingly, with Mark DuCharme...

My taste does run to the gimmicky--if you define Calvino, Perec, Mathews,
Queneau, Mayer, Borges, Pessoa, Padgett, Koch, as gimmicky writers. Are
these writers inauthentic?  I think not. I also love other types of
writers--Rilke, Lorca, Celan, Dickinson...

Here is the quote of Borges I was referring to the other day:

"Around 1930 I believed, under the influence of Macedonio Fernandez, that
beauty is the privilege of a few authors; now I know that it is common and
that it is lying in wait for us in the casual pages of mediocre authors or
in a conversation on the street.  Thus, my ignorance of Malayasian or
Hungarian letter is total, but I am convinced that if I had time for
studying them, I would find there all the nourishment necessary for my
spirit."

Just for the record, I never said, ala Mark DuCharme, that experiment was
NECESSARILY gimmicky.  Nor did I say I disliked gimmickry in all writing.
I merely proposed an experiment - an unusual one for this list, which
I still say is the most difficult experiment of all.  - Henry G.

"A poem is energy transferred from where the poet got it, by way of the
poem itself to, all the way over to, the reader.  Then the poem itself
must, at all points, be a high energy construct, and at all points, an
energy discharge.  To do this the poet can go by no track other than the
one the poem under hand declares for itself.  Thus he has to behave, and
be, instant by instant, aware of some several forces just now beginning to
be examined."

"Let's start from the smallest particle of all, the syllable.  It is the
king and pin of versification, what rules and holds together the lines,
the larger forms, of a poem.  If the syllable, that fine creature, were
more allowed to lead the harmony on...."

"Is it not the play of the mind we are after, is not that that shows
whether a mind is there at all?"

--from Olson's Projective Verse

If one were to proceed from Olson's tack than any notions of experimental
versus mainstream and/or traditional speech versus poetic speech (whatever
those demarcations are????) are moot.  It is what the poem demands.  And, I
believe, that in many ways Olson wrote this to refute WCW's The Revolution
of the Word.  WCW atomized the word; Olson universalizes the syllable, and
draws its interrelations not only with the word(s) but also the harmony and
music of it all.

Sure, it's a great book called *Speaking and Language: Defense of Poetry*
(London: Wildwood House, 1971).  Goodman was a poet & Gestalt psychologist
but here he's doing a kind of Burkean thing w/ discussions of langauge as
symbolic action.  But he has hs own smart insights to add.  He's been
somewhat forgotten among important predecesors to the New American POetry
crowd, but he was at Black Mountain & also influenced O'Hara.  -m.

Shimming is like swimming not one of my physical languages (I can _read_
it...). However, if there is a grid on land, it's amusing, a false situation
that invites false behavior (e.g. the famous "elegance" of math). Henry
mentions skepticism about literary language and truth value. Well, this is
one from poetry elementary school so we should be right to wonder about it
(at it?), but the thought is, poetry is nothing but lies, but they're lies
that tell the truth ordinary truth-telling avoids. You tell these lies to
transmit some (true??) emotion. This is probably a hokey
abstract-expressionist-influenced (read: Kierkegaardian?) way of thinking
about it. Poetry holds truth value in disregard, preferring what sounds
right or looks right -- and poetry that sounds wrong or looks wrong is no
better for its asceticism -- it only catches the people who notice that
looking right can be a trick.

Bach is someone who exhibits grid behavior, "right"? As opposed to road
rage.

Henry -- I wonder if Adorno's way of thinking about "autonomous" art might
be another way of mediating the "mainstream's" claim of autonomy for art
that, using his definitions, might seem considerably less autonomous -- I'm
thinking of some of his expressions in his debates with Benjamin and others
-- in the end, I don't think Adorno's distinction holds up so well either
(and given his remarks on jazz it's always difficult for me to read him at
all) -- but his approach to "autonomy" seems to have been forgotten in most
U.S. debates on these issues --

Subject:      Hoa Nguyen's DARK
Content-Type: text/plain

New from Mike & Dale's Press:



                    DARK, a book of poems by Hoa Nguyen with
illustrations by Suloni Robertson.



           Nguyen's poetry dissolves the complex projections of family,
love, and work into points of compact revelation. The relationships of
self and experience projected through the difficult contours of language
focus these poems into visions of life lived, not constructed. Nguyen's
attention to the minute details of sound in the poem create a music that
reaches into the intensity of noise without giving in to the shapeless,
late century chaos of methodology. DARK presents an experience of the US
that discerns the values of color amidst apparent liberal erasures of
race from 'polite society.' Buy this book while it lasts. Only 300
copies available. $7



Also from M&D Press:



Road Trip Through the Four Spheres

by John Herndon

I really only wanted to write in to say that I have been in complete
agreement with Jordan Davis's definiton of poetry as lies that point to a
truth for 30 years so am gladdened to see him saying it but is such docile
agreement on my part sufficient justification for 1/50th of the day's
moeity?

Write some more, then.Let me see. . .

I thought that maybe if I added to Jordan's alternative to Bach's gridlike
musical behavior, "road-rage..", "road-rage over a lost penny," my
intervention might excuse itself. It would be educive, adducing a
difference in art-epochs.

But I'm still not sure. I feel like I should rescue Bowering's bon-mot by
saying that when he scribbled on my fly I came to attention and saluted as
we ran his effort up the flagpole, and that that was how I came into the
love of poetry, because in that nonsense would be some lies pointing to a
truth, but geez I'm still not sure. Am I part of the problem, or part of a
possible way out?

Write some more, then.

I must say I agree with Joel when other people are perpetrating the
nonsense. His is a thankless task, and I'm sure we all realize this and
want to make it easier for him. I know I do. But I have trouble coloring
the sand in under the line. I hope he will b-c me when I go one toke over
it. I would prefer that to public remonstrance. Listafarians who have not
met Joel in person have missed a great deal and dont know how lucky we are
to have him riding herd on us, and not Ham Meatfist or Jock Strap or
Peaches Dobell.

I'll write some more...

One last attempt at worthwhile relevance (though not at all relevant to the
rest of this letter...I hope; it's just that I've started re-reading "Songs
of I and E") : what do Listafarians make of that line of Blake's, "And so I
stained the water clear"?

One might go on at some length in this format, and perhaps should keep a
"List Diary" then post once every day or so, on various topics. But would
this solve the problem, or only raise new difficulties--a list with fewer
posts, but longer? I admit to avoiding the "judging" thread, not that the
first few posts werent interesting, but just that the world, I feel, is
hopelessly irredeemable in these matters. People form likings for other
people and allow these to color their judgement. I have always disapproved
of this, while at the same time doing little else. To my observation,
everyone does this, whatever they say they do. But of course, since I am
persuaded of this from my own experience, I am the more likely to read it
in the motives of others.

Doesn't this connect via intuition to the feeling of being right?

Last night it was my turn to bring some writing in for analysis in a
"linguistic pragmatics" grad course, here at SFU.  From the EPC "Authors"
page, I downloaded part of Ron Silliman's "D E M O" (with citation!) and
circulated it among  the class.  Silence.  More silence. Then the remark:
"I think I'm being made fun of here."  I tried to explain that the poem
offered a more democratic model of writer/reader relations,  and perhaps
that explained the "funny feeling", but to no avail.  We moved on . . . .

So, I am wondering if anyone on the list has tried to apply such
procedures to "experimental writing", or if they know of any
critical works in which a "pragmatic" approach has been used to
talk about such writing.  From this first attempt, it
seems as though "linguistic pragmatics", or "discourse analysis", is
unable to address the complexities of experimental writing.

Did someone say "duh"?

This is the innocent novice language poet who, once delusionally
piping in the pre-verbal outside-the-text, then became a speech-obsessed
Beat singing songs of happy cheer, and now, not knowing what
he does, because the innocent has no he to do the knowing but
instead follows the disappearing-child-in-a-cloud's theory,
stupidly picks up a pen and threatens to poison the source of
our bodily fluids, all for the sake of ink.  Writing corrupts!
Experience will teach him that not every child will
joy to hear.

Aldon, I would have to be better read on Adorno to say anything about his
take on art autonomy.  Peter Burger in this classic text I'm reading
(Theory of the Avant-Garde) - no actually the guy writing the intro,
Schulte-Sasse - tries to distinguish between Burger's theory & Adorno's -
says Adorno was finally a pessimist about art's ability to influence
society, because he failed to recognize that art as we know it is
mediated to "bourgois-capitalist society" by the INSTITUTION called
"art".  & that early 20th-cent. avant-garde is essentially an attack
on the INSTITUTION of art for the sake of redefining art's relation to
society (& thereby redefining what art is).

I dunno Adorno.

But the general idea of artists as resentful alienated guys upset at
being displaced by capitalist commercial pulp culture & thus being the
vanguard of a new society is only true if you equate artists with
intellectuals.  I'm not willing to grant intellectuals that honor.
See Montale on these questions.  Intellectuals can talk our way to
socialism, fine.  But that doesn't make them poets. - Henry G.

Roger, I don't know who's teaching your "linuistic pragmatics" course but
he/she seems not to have read any pragmatists (am I right to assume that
that befuddled reaction to Silliman was the *professor's* reaction?).  In
any event, as I've argued probably too much on this list, American
experimental writing is deeply pragmatic.  There is no Stein as we know
her w/out William James, for instance.  Take this:

"We ought to say a feeling of *and*, a feeling of *if*, a feeling of
*but*, and a feeling of *by*, quite as readily as we say a feeling of
*blue* or a feeling of *cold*.  Yet we do not: so inveterate has our habit
become of recognizing the existence of the substantive parts alone, that
langauge almost refuses to lend itself to any other use" (Principles of
Psycology, 1: 245-6).

James calls for "a re-instatement of the vague to it's proper place in our
mental life" (254), and his sense of such propriety is based on a very
pragmatic sense of the usefulness of that re-instatement.  I've quoted
this before but it may be worth quoting again, if for nothing else than to
give you, perhaps, some ammunition for your next attempt to bring lang po
to class.  This is Dewey talking about philosophy but it applies equally
to poetry:

"A Philosophy animated, be it consciously or unconsciously, by the
strivings of men to achieve democracy will construe liberty as meaning a
universe in which there is real uncertainty and contingency, a world which
is not all in, and never will be, a world which in some respect is
incomplete and in the making, and in these respects may be made this way
or that according as men judge, prize, love and labor…a genuine field of
novelty, of real and unpredictable increments of existence, a field for
experimentation and invention."  See *Characters and Events* (New York:
Henry Holt, 1929), Vol. 2, p. 851.

Silliman's experimentalism comes out of real egalitarian desires
pragmatically considered (stop me, Ron, if your a closet facist or
transcendentalist), and his more socialist hopes are, I would say, just as
manifest in his formal decisions.  It's just that to argue this case takes
work and attention to the details of grammar that most people in a seminar
aren't willing or able to do.

Henry, one quick question re: Adorno--Do you think what he calls the
"culture industry" is the same as "the INSTITUTION called art?" My sense
of Adorno's aesthetic criticism is that he held very contradictory views
on art's ability to function/exist under current "bourgois-capitalist"
systems. You know, the neg dialectic, the snake eating its own tail,
etc. Not to deny the pessimism, but to acknowledge the complexity of his
views... Dale

Michael, it seems that what Farr is suggesting is a difficulty for a
certain group of students who read Silliman's D E M O. The "pragmatics"
you discuss is appropriate to Stein, to Silliman--to a whole tradition
of poetics that values the influence of philosophical systems over, or
in addtion to, other "poetic" systems. But I also think to bring a text
of Silliman's to a poetry seminar would be problematic for an
instructor, because critical expectations and the critical tools of
articulation are varied and complex. Silliman's texts demand a knowledge
of philosphical systems in the West. His texts also function within a
poetic tradition more familiar to students of that art. It seems to me
that the 'pragmatics' of articulation--poetic, linguistic,
philosophical, psychological--are limited by enforced divisions in our
thought. In the poem--in Silliman's 'texts'--these elements are
complicated, driven into one another, made indistinguishable. I can see
how, being submitted to D E M O for the first time might be a bit
confusing, and that it calls for more than mere pragmatics from an
instructor to engage it, regardless of a pragmatic tradition in the
avant garde. The problem here, as always, is how to address the
complexities of the whole by way of the contradictory elements of each
part, driven by the divisions of our own knowledge. Dale.

I would see a lot of your words as falling, yar, between correct &
intriguing Jordan. Speaking of noticing looking right can be a trick, I'd
say there's a lot of poets who like to see others see them noticing that
looking right can be a trick & thereby trying to look wrong & by
extension right. That's some of the current NYC post-innovative
avant-gardener biz at the moment. I think in San Francisco there's more
ice than in New York, & less anxiety about the rightness of looking as
cleverly wrong as possible. But no one assumes you're right I don't think
when you don't climb mountains with anti-trust lawyers 'cause of the hole
in your boot which is a known SF occurence. However, it can be further
noted that SF & NYC are two of the most provincial poetry crystal balls
in the galaxy. Once, anyway, you start saying "poetry" in that general
sense doesn't every statement that follows become instantly wrong? & then
right? Isn't Jack Spicer just completely lying in all of his poems
(especially that cop out line about nobody listening to poetry)? Do the
statements on this list qualify as truth because they're prose, or
because they're made by folks who know they're wrong when they're right?
Isn't it mostly guys here worrying about how to be right all the time but
sounding pretty convinced they are even tho' that means they're wrong in
expopoetryland?

Culture industry means what we would call "entertainment
industry"--popular music, hollywood, etc...  I'm not sure Adorno was
against "the institution of art" if we mean traditional "high" culture, eg
"classical music," literature, paintings.  In fact this rather elitist
conception of art is exactly what Adorno privileges.

God forbid we should ask students of poetry to know about "philosphical
traditions in the West" or linguists interested in "pragmatics" to have
read William James.  This isn't even about being interdisciplinary, it's
about knowing what we are talking about on the most basic level.

Jose Saramago, Portugese novelist, has won the Nobel prize. He is quite
well known in Spain; I have seen interviews with him and the like in my
frequent trips there, but I've not read him.

I'm not sure that "pragmatics" as linguists use the term has much to do
with the James->Dewey->Rorty lineage of American philosophy, though I
could be wrong and am awaiting enlightenment.

I had a better experience presenting a Bob Perelman poem (the title
escapes me, but it contained my favorite line, "Slay a piece of Shit /
Syntax as usual") to a seminar of graduate students in a course on
discourse analysis. They were a bit baffled by the poem, but got into by
trying to identify the various discursive practices that constitute that
poem (medical, advertising/promotion, etc).  There were still a few people
who had trouble with the fact that the poem didn't make sense in the way
that a "real poem" (or a Hallmark greeting card for that matter) makes
sense.  What to do? I wondered. Still, it sounds like my colleagues did
better than the lingprag crowd.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Publishers Weekly publishes poetry reviews not weekly but monthly, on the
last Monday of every month, with ten or so full reviews (capsules of about
250 words) and ten or so "notes" (shorter) appearing each time.
Forthcoming reviews include Bob Perelman's _The Future of Memory_, Mei-mei
Berssenbrugge's _Four Year Old Girl_ and many others of interest.  It would
be wonderful if more poets and publishers on the list would submit books
for review.  Here's how it works:

PW Forecasts, the reviewing side of the magazine, is a "pub date" driven
affair.  The aim is for the reviews to reach bookstore buyers and others
before the book is published.  That means that titles need to be submitted
for review a *minimum* of three months before they "pub."

For most publishers, that means sending some sort of mock-up of the book (a
set of typeset pages, or a typescript), rather than a finished book for
review.  Said mock-up must be held together in some way, be it comb
binding, three hole punch, heavy duty staple, or whatever (the actual book
is also OK) and accompanied by a letter with the following information:

     publisher's name, address, phone, fax, etc.
     book's title, author, price, binding, ISBN number
     eventual number of pages in the finished book
     distributor, if any
     month of publication

All the above info. is essential, and the pub month particularly so.  (If
you submit a title for review that you then find will be later than
expected, please send an alert.)  A short bio of the author and list of
previous titles published by the press help.  Send material to

     Poetry Forecasts
     Publishers Weekly
     245 West 17th Street
     New York, NY 10011

Submissions are not generally returned, and publishers are usually not
notified that a book will be reviewed.  To check in, fax Forecasts at
212-463-6631 or send a letter to the above.

PW is skewed toward big corp. publishers, no question.  Small press titles
published in the months of September, October, November & March, April,
May, June are more likely to be squeezed out by the larger presses, who
tend toward fall & spring lists.  Chapbooks are almost never reviewed.
Publishers with a distributor (like SPD) are much more likely to be
reviewed than those without.

Roof, Atelos, O, Tender Buttons, Kelsey Street, Talisman, What and others
have had or will have had titles reviewed or mentioned in the last year or
so.  It would be great to add to that list.  Often, books that aren't
selected are sent along to reviewers anyway, in the hope that they will
pitch a review elsewhere.

PW has a circulation of, I think, nearly 40,000 (all of whom avidly read
the poetry reviews) and tells prospective advertisers it reaches more than
twice that.  Subscriptions are absurdly expensive, but most local and
university libraries get it.  Even if it's not displayed as part of the
library's current periodicals, the librarian in charge of acquisitions
might be persuaded to allow a perusal of internal copies.

I often have the same experience, or something similar, when reading certain
"experimental," or what I feel is heavily opaque, poetry.  Actually, I would
say instead of "I think I'm being made fun of here, that "I think I'm being
completely ignored here," rather than attribute any malicious or sadistic
intent to the writer.  I can feel invisible, not usually mocked.  But how
democratic is that?  To be left completely alone, isolated, with a "template"
style of writing which can be interpreted any way I choose, with whatever
perceptual tools/capacities I choose?  Is that "democracy?"  As I ask this
question, I realize that the isolation I sometimes feel with extremely opaque,
"private" writing IS, in fact, a prominent quality of the capitalist version
of democratic culture, as I experience it.  So....why not, in that case, just
read a stone? or a tarot card?   I haven't read Silliman's DEMO, so I don't
refer to that particular work in my impulsive response.  I refer instead to
work that leaves me with a sense that I, as reader, have either been left out
of the equation, or left to my own devices, or used as if I were an
undiscerning and gullible audience who was willing to watch someone
"experiment" on my time, with no effort to offer anything in return for the
time I've invested.  Anyway...this is a "feeling-level" response, rather than
a thoughtful one.  I simply find it quite ironic that writing which claims to
be "democratic" and "egalitarian" can often leave a reader feeling "one-down,"
"invisible," "isolated," and "unequal" (to the task).

I often have the same experience, or something similar, when reading certain
"mainstream," or what I feel is heavily transparent, poetry.

To be left completely alone, isolated, with a style of writing which can,
supposedly,
be interpreted in one way by its readership, with some set of shared perceptual
tools/capacities I refuse/apparently don't have?

read a copy of People magazine? or watch TV?

I haven't read much mainstream work recently, so I don't refer to any particular

in my response.  I refer instead to work that leaves me with a sense that I, as
reader, have either been left out of the equation, or left to my own devices, or

tell me what "we all" think, with no effort to let me participate, despite the

Aviva, I understand your skepticism about this claim to "democracy" and
certainly if I writer's opacity is simply a matter of adopting a private
code then I say to hell with him.  But Silliman's work, just to be
specific, is determinedly public:

                                        A moment
                not a movement, and the moment's past.
                It makes you look on those Mickey Mouse
                beach towels  used as curtains
                with a renewed sense of wonder.  Like housepainters
                without a truck carrying stepladders
                up the block.  The way blue ink fades
                when the pen runs dry (What, 111).

There's nothing here on the level of vocabulary or image that almost
anyone speaking any American vernacular wouldn't understand.  The
difficulty of *What* is about sentence connections - but thematically that
seems entirely appropriate, something about which I've had fair success
convincing my students.  Look at these sentences: there about ephemeral,
decontextualized experience,  Making sense of them is alot like making
sense of the painters - what the hell are they doing there?  where's their
truck? This is about the logical connection we rely on being removed, at
which point we become aware that we're always making narratives to fill in
logical gaps - this can be simply a matter of quick accomodation, or, and
this seems to me the more interesting possibility, a matter of stepping
into those gaps & looking around, doing some extra-textual creative work
of one kind or another.  The point being, this isn't tabula rasa; Silliman
isn't saying, here's a space where you can do whatever you want.  He's
encouraging dialogue - it's an antiphonal model, I think.  Pedagogically,
I encourage students to look for common ground first & then work toward
the incoherent spaces.  -m.

The first time I came across this response was in a reading group. I'd
brought, as a favourite piece, the Wallace Stevens poem "Stars Over
Talapoosa". Prior to this, none of this had occurred me. I accepted the
poetry for what it was. No baggage about poetics...just savouring the poem
for what it is, rather than actively seeking some pre-interred template of
meaning. The response "is it a joke" came up there. I guess - and I'm not
proselytising here - that re-learning responses can be difficult. Being
presented with a new paradigm of reading poetry can be quite daunting. I
have sympathy, but only in so far that this is a first-time response -
"this is a joke" should, IMO, give way to "why is this joke" and a further
deeper engagement with the poetry.

as briefly as possible --

a good place to pick up Adorno on these issues is in the essay on
"Commitment" (1962), where his direct target is Sartre but Adorno's old
debate with Benjamin is still very much in evidence.  Adorno rejects both
the "art for art's sake" argument commonly attached to early 20th century
formalisms, recognizing how often it masks a politics that refuses to name
itself as such.  But he also rejects Benjamin's claims for the "committed"
art of Brecht.  Adorno argues that "It is not the office of art to
spotlight alternatives, but to resist by its form alone the course of the
world, which permanently puts a pistol to men's heads."

Again, while I don't believe for a minute that Adorno's attempts to
distinguish "autonomous" from"non-" (?) will hold up, it strikes me that
this sounds a great deal like some arguments advanced among poets in recent
decades in the U.S. -- and it further strikes me that many critical
responses to those poets seem unaware of these earlier debates --

Isn't that one important point though, in much lang po, that reading is/
becomes central, to counteract the specialization or undistracted
absorption much more mainstream poetry invites? Isn't the lang po use of
disjunction related to the idea in Barthes' (& others) that whatever can be
read as text. Then maybe some lang po has the effect of showing how and in
what way(s).

The thing was, nobody was saying Mr. Adorno was aginst the art institution.
Or the culture industry, however you define the borders.  Burger's thesis
is that the AVANT-GARDE - the specific avant-garde - Dada, Surrealist, others
- of the 20s & 30s - was out to overturn the art/culture industry, because
they saw for the 1st time how art itself is structured/mediated by the
institution of art.  That I think is the thesis.

Now this is all very well & good & who looks right or wrong in SF NY and
PDNK (Podunk) is a matter of vocabulary more than anything else unless
gesture is taken under account, BUT

the question of what kind of world we inhabit, what or who we are,
& who decides how we live & where, & who owns what, & who does what,
& what civilization is, and what freedom is, & what oppression & peace &
deprivation are, & what is art & poetry, & what is life, & what is death,
& what are words & poems & music, & what is culture & what is a loon,
are just as important perhaps as what's on TV, and

I have often thought that poetry has built-in para- or anti-art capabilities,
but this may have been a mistaken assumption, especially if

Brecht was nicer

and then poetry magnets, and

I too understand Aviva's skepticism, and the difficulty of Roger Farr's
students facing Silliman's work for the first time. But I think the
problems are almost entirely about conditioning. I share Karen Kelley's
sense of a similar blank lost-ness in the face of much so-called mainstream
poetry, but I admit that's got a lot to do with my own conditioning during
a twenty-year commitment to experimentalist poetics.

but I don't think Ron Silliman's work is a blank slate about which anything
can be said and all is equal. Neither do I think he is making fun of the
reader -- in fact, I do think he is, in small and large ways, freeing the
reader from being led by the nose, respecting the reader's ability to
function in a context of shifting uncertainties (which is our context,
isn't it?).

DEMO begins:

        This is a test.

What is a test? Well, pretty much everything. And how to put it together.
But there are lots of clues here, like on the first page of the work, a
little after this opening:

        Up against the woolite, desire for narrative condemns millions -- French
bread hard as a rock.

DEMO ends:

        The sun itself demands no explanation, but this cargo cult of nouns sings
its own song, its own name, again and again.

It just seems to me that one could spend a whole class, in an advanced or
beginning poetry workshop, getting students pretty excited about talking
about just these three "lines" of the poem and what they might mean, what
they might invite of the reader, and on the issue of whether or not this is
more DEMOcratic than a lot of poetry out there.

And if you read the rest of the poem, you may ended up getting carried away
by its wit, humor, and hard-hitting impact as well.

(spoken as an unabashed supporter of the work, being its publisher in book
form)

and I'll make this my last today so that I don't use too much of this
resource (in my own defense, my average over a longer period is lower than
others!)


I seem to recall that "pragmatics" in linguistics has a particular meaning
that is not quite the same as philosophical pragmatics -- as our
correspondent is currently in a class on the subject, perhaps we might get
a clear definition  --

at any rate, it would not at all surprise me that people studying
linguistic pragmatics would be confounded by a Silliman passage --
students, professors, or casual hangers on -- for much the same reason that
Searle and others argue that we shouldn't START with poetry if we want to
understand how language actually operates (the argument he tried to have
with Derrida and others in the 70s-80s) --

The pragmatism of James is only tangentially relevant to pragmatics in this
sense IF I REMEMBER  correctly from my own undergrad. courses in
linguistics some twenty very odd years ago -- and my own sense, contra
Searle and others, is that Silliman might indeed be a fine starting point,
even in pragmatics

Agreed, but with nothing against BM or JM, it's not unusual to notice in
the broader field of artistic endeavour (I'm thinking of torch singers
right now) that the less innovative an artist may be the more authentic
and moving she often can be. Down and dirty is a term that springs to mind.

I'm certain Adorno considered "high culutre" as a part of the culture
industry, along with "popular music, hollywood, etc." I mean, it's all
in how this stuff gets used. Not that ART cannot exist in its own right,
but that it is implicated in, and by, the society in which, and by
which, it is created. What's important, I think, is not to think of,
say, the Black Mountain poem, the language poem, as something superior,
or in any way separate from, the culture industry. I mean, in an era of
regurgitaion and transmutation, anything is possible. What's
counterrevolutionary today is on a tee shirt tomorrow. That's just the
way our society deals with transgressive ideas: it makes them safe for
'consumption,' intellectual or otherwise. But don't despair! Philosophy,
linguistics, geography, politics, anthropology &etc &etc are all tools
of the poet today. These diverse fields provide a richer view by which
to weigh ideas of poetic impulse. But poetry that is overly conscious of
a single element is often flat, void of the deeper substance (sorry this
is so alchemical) that open worlds through poetry. I mean, that's what
this is about to me, the opening and closing of worlds through language.
It's not about the 'rightness' or 'wrongness' of our 'thoughts' or
'feelings' toward the 'poem,' but about our willingness to engage our
own values with as much of our 'selves' open as can be allowed. Isn't
that why we all think we 'know' something of the 'poem,' of our
'selves?' Regardless, my point is, we think in pieces, the unity and
completion of the whole being somewhat removed from the varied impulses
and regions of our senses.

My favorite LCD motto is from Jenny Holzer:
"Protect me from what I want."

Sold a few year ago on a baseball cap at the Mary Boone gallery.
I didn't buy one then & still regret it to this day.

Is that the Devil we know or the Devil we don't know?  Looks like a great
issue -- can you tell us which piece by Jose Lezama Lima has been
translated?  And, just so I'll know as I read it, did the interview in this
issue involve actually speaking with the interview subject?

I included 5 pieces of Lezam Lima's from "The Fragments Drawn By Charm."
(Roberto Tejada was kind enough to let me use his translations. I'm sure
you've seen Mandorla, Tejada's journal. If not, let me know.) And, yeah,
the Kyger interview involves live, living persons. I interviewed her in
May of 97. I mean, Joanne's the real thing. I couldn't have written
anything this generous, subtle and insightful. I've been working with
her nearly a year on the edits, trying to narrow and focus. As for the
Devil, well, I dragged him off some 16th century make-shift barge last
seen floating in the gulf of mexico. The Karankawas called him
"Badthing." I don't know how that got into this issue.

All the best,
Dale

"Towards an Open Universe" was broadcast in the VOA Forum Series
"Contemporary American Poetry" on 23 October 1964, and then published in the
VOA paperback (for overseas distribution only) in 1964  _Contemporary
American Poetry_, edited by Howard Nemerov, under the imprint of "Voice of
America Forum Lectures." There were 19 lectures by such as Marianne Moore,
Jack Gilbert, and John Berryman as well as Nemerov hisself. For
Bibliographic freaks, the essay occupies pp. 169-183; there is a photo of
Duncan and a brief blurb on 168. This book is not listed in Bertholf's
Bibliography of RD.

Poets were invited to "speak to" four questions:
1. Do you see your work as having essentially changed in style or character
since you began?
2. Is there, or has there been, was there ever, a "revolution" in poetry, or
is all that a matter of a few sleazy technical tricks?
3. Does the question whether the world has changed during this century
preoccupy you in poetry? Does your work appear to you to envision the
appearance of a new human nature, for better or worse, or does it view the
many and obvious changes as exxentially technological?
4. What is the proper function of criticism? Is there a speciaes of it you
admire (are able to get along with)?

Although according to Bertholf's Bibliography of Duncan the 30-minute tape
is available "only at the offices of the United States Information Agency"
(presumably on request, in any country where such an office is maintained),
a note at the beginning of the VOA book says "Permission is herewith granted
to rebroadcast and reprint it outside the continental limits of the United
States."

 [Any takers, among all you folk outside the US of A?]

The US trade edition of this book, _Poets on Poetry_ (NY Basic Books, 1966)
necessarily lacks that note.

At the back of the book is an address to send enquiries to: Forum Editor,
Voice of America, USIS, Washington 25, D.C., United States of America.  I
have no idea how good THAT is anymore.

Next for Titanic: a touring theme park


            By Erich Boehm
            LONDON (Variety) - The biggest film of all time is about to
get bigger with the launch of ``Titanic: The Official Movie
Tour,'' a theme-park style movable event based on James
Cameron's blockbuster.
            Twentieth Century Fox has set up the extravaganza, to debut
at London's Wembley Exhibition Hall on Dec. 15 and proceed city
by city around the world for five years, to allow people to
``participate'' in ``Titanic.''
            The public will be able to visit parts of the movie's set,
interact with the picture through multimedia exhibits, learn how
the f/x were done or even enjoy a meal in the ship's dining
hall. Merchandise will be peddled in an area resembling an
Edwardian high street.
            The show is billed as the first of its kind. Fox is
partnered in the project with the L.A.-based company Special
Entertainment Events (SEE). Also on board are Cameron's
Lightstorm Entertainment, British promoter Harvey Goldsmith and
the German convention organizer Messe Duesseldorf.
            Meanwhile, not to be outdone, Paramount is debuting its
``Star Trek World Tour'' -- also created in conjunction with SEE
-- in December in Dusseldorf, Germany. Details on that show,
however, remain sketchy.
            Though no budgets were given, both events are clearly
massive investments. In the case of the ``Titanic'' show, it
will spend one month in London, with admission at about $20,
before moving on to Amsterdam, Paris, Dusseldorf and Milan. In
total, 20 cities are scheduled.
            ``Titanic'' producer Jon Landau, on hand for the press
launch of the show in London, told Daily Variety that he
expected more and more films would be re-marketed this way in
the future. ``It will make people feel like they're part of
making the movie,'' Landau said. ``People can complete their
emotional journey.''
            Landau added that ``Titanic,'' with a global box office of
more than $1.8 billion, was ``still on sturdy legs'' and that,
besides the video release, its potential could be pushed in even
more ways, such as alternative edits, perhaps even a version
that emphasizes historical accuracy over romance.
            When Landau and Goldsmith were queried as to the wisdom of
launching such an enterprise given present global economic
conditions, both expressed the view that entertainment
traditionally fares reasonably well during a recession.

Absolutely.  Derrida can be picked up by advertising campaigns, and
William Burrough's can sell shoes.  But the thing which I took from
Adorno. . .(and its the only thing which has glommed to my memory) is
the image of Odysseus in "The Dialectic of Enlightenment" co-written
with Horkheimer.  I come across this passage quoted a lot, for a variety
of different purposes, or more to the point:  I quote it a lot, for a
variety of different purposes, some or all of which may not have
anything to do with the authors original intents.

"[Odysseus] knows only two possible ways to escape.  One of them he
prescribes for his men.  He plugs their ears with wax, and they must row
with all their strength.  Whoever would survive must not hear the
temptation of that which is unrepeatable, and he is able to survive only
by being unable to hear it.  Society has always made provision for
that.  The laborers must be fresh and concentrate as they look ahead,
and must ignore whatever lies to one side. . . . The other possibility
Oddysseus, the seigneur who allows the others to labor for themselves,
reserves to himself.  He listens, but while bound impotentently to the
mast;  the greater the temptation the more he has his bonds tightened."
-- H & A

Reading this into poetry, it would seem to suggest:  Hey, do whatever
the f*** you want.  Be experimental.  Be crude.  Reader's digest may get
uptight, but a university will hire you;  the NEA will give you grants;
well dressed men and women will ask why you have to say the word "f***"
so often, but they'll still attend your readings.  You just have to make
sure that "aesthetic" is separated from "political;" interesting "ideas"
are separated from "actions," and that "theory" is separated from
"practice."   Be philosophical, strange, even--God help us--intelligent,
but tether yourself to the mast.

Of course. . . the trajectories of the great pinball game can't really
be contained or described adequately by this or any other theory (or
poem).  Some renegade reactionaries may lynch you, even if you style
yourself as the most mild-mannered academic.  Even so. . .T&H gives
another way of looking at why it is that "establishment" ("They," by
which of course I mean "Them") still cuddles up to poets and other
heretics from time to time.

My 2 cents.

Two ways these guys missed the boat, so to speak.
1. The show should include a full-size submersible replica of the original
ship, so that customers could vicariously experience the thrill if drowning.
2. There should be franchised therapists on hand, to help those who have
difficulty "complet[ing] their emotional journey."

This seems to be a worthwhile direction to pursue.  It moves us beyond
the
simple experimental/non-experimental dis cussions that go on and on and
on
top of the stove when I last saw it.  Do you have an example of a poem
or
form that "hooks" the reader in and then engages in opening or closing
worlds?  I am aware that I tend to be somewhat (or very!) opaque without
really intending to be.

Adorno was capable of great arrogance in his pronouncements on art...  tho
the sense of provocation is often so great that the reader can not help but
feel that he is over hearing an argument between Adorno and his demons:

"In actuality, much more effort is required to listen adequately to a piece
by Beethoven, whose themes the average man in the street (!) might whistle
to himself , than to a piece of the most advanced music..."

"There is a temptation to regard the most educated listeners as the worst:
those who promptly react to Schoenberg with 'I do not understand'--an
utterance whose modesty masks anger as expertise."

"The all-powerful culture industry appropriates the enlightening principle
and, in its relationship with human beings, defaces it for the benefit of
prevailing obscurity.  Art vehemently opposes this tendency; it offers an
ever-sharper contrast to such false clarity.  The configurations of that
deposed obscurity are held up in opposition to the prevailing neon-light
style of the times.  Art is able to aid enlightenment only by relating the
clarity of the world consciously to its own darkness."

He is, sometimes, close to the hysteria he describes so well:  "What radical
music perceives is the untransfigured suffering of man...  The seismographic
registration of traumatic shock becomes, at the same time, the technical
structural law of music.  It forbids continuity and development.  Musical
language is polarized according to its extremes:  towards gestures of shock
resembling bodily convulsions on the one hand, and on the other towards a
crystalline standstill of a human being whom anxiety causes to freeze in her
tracks."

"Through hostility towards art, the work of art approaches knowledge...  Its
cognitive character becomes radical in that moment in which art is no longer
content with the role of perception.  This is the threshold of modern art,
which grasps its own contradictions with such depth that they can no longer
be arbitrated.  Modern art infuses the concept of form with such tension
that the aesthetic product is forced to confess its insolvency before it.
Modern art permits the contradiction to remain, revealing the original
foundation of its categories of judgment--that is, of form.  It discards the
dignity of the judge and descends to the level of the plaintiff, the only
position for which reality provides a conciliation."

The relentlessly dialectical nature of his thought seldom allows the reader
to draw a "conclusion" -- we draw and draw and draw and seem no closer to
understanding.  This is a great deal of the fun of reading Adorno:  that he
wanted us to understand so clearly that any time we believe we understand,

I've seen the paperback -- in fact, I ran across it in the departmental
common room here in Sweden, complete with a big red stamp reading
"United States Information Agency" -- I love the irony of finding Duncan
and Berryman and Corso published worldwde by such an incongruous agency.




Although according to Bertholf's Bibliography of Duncan the 30-minute
tape
is available "only at the offices of the United States Information
Agency"
(presumably on request, in any country where such an office is
maintained),
a note at the beginning of the VOA book says "Permission is herewith
granted
to rebroadcast and reprint it outside the continental limits of the
United
States."

 [Any takers, among all you folk outside the US of A?]


Hello!  Yow! Yes, there's the note.  When I stop in at my friendly
neighborhood USIA office up in Stockholm to ask about the recording,
I'll make inquiries about how valid that claim is in 1998.  There's no
expiration date mentioned, but it seems a bit too good to be true.  Will

Roger Farr's students have my sympathy.

Isn't pragmatics in linguistics as different from pragmatics in philosophy
as objectivism in poetry is from objectivism in political philosophy (or
whatever it is you would consider Ms. Rand's theoretical genre to have
been)?

If you emphasize the "no" and the "poetry", you get a completely different
sense, as in a derogatory one. Just a thought.

I notice that Majorie Perloff prescribes hesitations to denote line-endings
in her essay about vers libre; why not a mixture of emphasis and
hesitation?

What's the difference between a hesitation on the line-break, and a
emphasis on the last word before the line-break?

How does a pause to denote line-endings differentiate from a pause denoted
by a comma in the middle of a line?

The poem, in full, reads:

This ocean, humiliating in its disguises
Tougher than anything.
No one listens to poetry. The ocean
Does not mean to be listened to. A drop
Or crash of water. It means
Nothing.
It
Is bread and butter
Pepper and salt. The death
That young men hope for. Aimlessly
It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals. No
One listens to poetry.

The central image here being "This ocean," liquid, thing
later claimed "not mean[t] to be listened to." Which
is not to say not listened to. I'm curious why
"This ocean" is the first image we get in a book called
"Language" & in a section/poem called "Thing Language."
Is "this ocean" language, or is language seen as somehow like
an ocean? & therefore fluid? &, if fluid, not rigid
in its limits (what we might read as "meanings")?

I think this poem itself "Aimlessly/ ... pounds the shore."
Meaning, pounds itself against something less liquid
than itself. Fizzling out against it. If we emphasize the
last word in the penultimate line, NO
it may be a repeat of the line previously given w/out
punctuation or linebreak. But, why? I think there's an
intentional ambiguity here. We emphasize first words in
a line, too: No
ONE listens to poetry. He's broken the line here I think
to suggest a reading alternative to the anthemic quip
most readers come away with. I think he's after more than
anthem, especially in a poem that claims "not mean[t] to be
listened to." An anthem means to be listened to. And in
a very unambiguous way.

I don't think this poem is a cop out. I think the reduction
of this poem to an anthem might be. But at least is a
shallow or cursory reading of it.

I feel like addressing Anselm's "I'd say there's a lot of
poets who like to see others see them noticing that
looking right can be a trick & thereby trying to look wrong
& by extension right." Or at least asking him what he
means. Who are these poets for whom being looked at is
primary? And how was the conclusion that this is "the case"
reached? Are those questioning cultural (including
aesthetic) "givens" preening? Merely?

These aren't rhetorical questions. Thanks.

Yes, and doesn't poetics potentially bring philosophy and linguistics
together, concerned as it is both with the immediate pragmatic use of
words and the larger issues involved? Just as semantics in the narrow way
defined in linguistics and semantics as concern in  philosophy of
language are separate--beloning to separate academic disciplines--but we
should be intellectuals, which means not isolating problems in a narrow
way. The linguistics professor should know enough at least to explain the
differences + potential areas of convergent interest.

Thanks to Jonathan Mayhew for making a start toward the definition of
pragmatics as understood by linguists. But could someone please clarify
this for us? Maybe the original poster, or someone else w/ a linguistics
background? Or could someone call down the ghost of Jack Spicer to impart
his professional knowledge on this topic.
        I'm wondering, because I suspect that if it is like most subfields
in linguistics, its practitioners are probably is more comfortable working
with  conventional, conversational sentences, in which the context is
determined w/ relative ease. Consequently, while poetic discourse would
seem to open up new research areas, it would also probably create
difficulties beyond the capacities of the current paradigms. Though I
could be way wrong about this.

David,

I am most familiar with the area of linguistic pragmatics called deixis,
which could be crudely defined as that class of words and phrases that
orients discourse in terms of a speaker and/or audience.  I tend to think
of it as also indicating some kind of spatial or temporal relationship
among them.  Deixis is often described as a "pointing" mechanism, as
when we use deictic  adjectives such as "this" or "that," or "here" or
"there" or "now" when used as adverbs or adjectives.  Also phrases like
"beside" or "next to" or "in front of" are deictic in that their user
assumes a place in terms of which the utterance they occur makes relative
sense.

But there's more to lingusitic pragmatics than deixis.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Many of the discussions on the list that involve Adorno mention as
asides his 'revolting' position vis a vis jazz. As an enthusiast of the
Adorno of Negative Dialectics, Against Epistemology and Dialectic of
Enlightenment which he wrote with Horkheimer, I too have found Adorno's
position vis a vis jazz, critically suspect but not incomprehensible.

Certainly, there is some truth to Adorno's critique of Stravinsky's "Le
Sacre du printemps" in that the composer wants the music to sound like
music from the "beginning of time", an obvious conceit. This kind of
hegemony occurs again in Stravinsky's works that incorporate what
Stravinsky interprets as jazz elements and as with Le Sacre one feels a
kind of bourgeois appropriation on the part of the composer. The result
is watered down primitivism even as the effect was at one time shocking
and novel and now, for the non-primitive like myself, intensely
pleasurable.

On the other hand Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique is a revolt against
a programmatic romanticism accreting in harmonic excess. Whatever the
result (and I listen with enjoyment and often passion to all of the
above music) Schoenberg, Berg and Webern, in Adorno's mind, revolted
against the same sensibility that Stravinsky was exploiting albeit in
anew way.

But what jazz was Adorno attacking? I haven't done much of the legwork
but it appears that Adorno's position toward jazz was cemented well
before the advent of bebop when jazz was perhaps the preeminent form of
popular music and was represented by many adulterated and highly
commercialized forms bowdlerized by the recording industry which Adorno
despised. This alone would have set a purist like Adorno off. Adorno was
seeking a 'high art' musical form that would be embraced by the masses.
Of course, Benjamin was right when he told Adorno that would never
happen.

But jazz itself with the advent of bebop began an aesthetically and
politically self-induced process of marginalization and isolation that I
as a young man saw as dove-tailing with twelve tone, serial and
aleatoric music. I even wrote a long poem comparing the artistic and
political revolutionary aspects of these forms of jazz and classical
music called 'House Party Startin' named after a tune by the jazz
pianist-composer, Herbie Nichols.

One then wonders if Adorno in his intellectual pique was able to discern
jazz from the consumer culture that used it when there was a dollar to
be made and abused it when it could no longer fill the big ballrooms?
Even his main bugaboo, a steady beat based on syncopation doesn't nearly
always apply. Even if he didn't wait for Monk or Bud Powell, Bill Evans
or Cecil Taylor he could have found copious exceptions in the music of
Art Tatum and even the Count Basie.

But even Lazarsfeld generous criticisms could not convince Adorno to
bring a more 'empirical' and less polemical element to his constructs
especially when they predicted seriality in every home. This ironically
gives Adorno's work its great value for in that learned obstinance comes
the clear exposition of extremes in a culture of consumption designed to
advertise some fictional norm. Scoenberg's appeal to Adorno was as a
revolutionary. Too bad he couldn't see it in Charlie Parker, Archie
Shepp, Ornette Coleman and Miles Davis. (By the time of the latter
fellows Adorno had returned to Europe but over there jazz was getting
more respect than here and that should have told Teddy something.)

So to answer my own question, Adorno would have probably produced a
tortured intellectual construct that would allow a stubborn consistency
to prevail in his critique even while he considered the social and
aesthetic dovetailing that has occurred between jazz and classical music
exemplified in say Anthony Braxton and Iannis Xenakis. I can remember
reading Cage's Silence in Rudd Fleming's modern poetry class at the
University of Maryland 30 years ago and then going home and popping on
Coltrane's Ascension and thinking these cats are onto something that
somehow expresses a marvelous continuity.---Carlo Parcelli

Thanks. That's helpful. I remember several years back reading a guy's MA
thesis on deixis. I knew that "deictic" words were words w/ shifting
referents like "this" or "that," but man, I was completely unprepared for
the complexity that the pros have to get into.
        I wonder if anyone's ever written on deixis and ashbery -- seems
to be central to his work...
        Just rambling. Seriously, thinks for the clarification: this helps.

Thought I'd throw the following into the brew. This is included in a short
sketch of the work of Charles Morris, author of _Foundations of the Theory
of Signs_ (1938), put together by Eugene Halton. The URL is found below.

"Pragmatics, a basic field of linguistics
today, originally had its roots in Morris's idea of a division of signs
concerned with "the relations of signs to their
interpreters" or users. Practically, this distinction seemed
to legitimate the place of social context for language study,
which was a crucial feature of both John Dewey and
Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophies at that time, as well as
of the work of Sapir, Malinowski, and others. Yet Morris's
behaviorism unsemeiotically assumed that "users" of signs
are not also themselves signs. Similarly, he assumed the
logical empiricist "myth of the given" in viewing objects of
signs--designata or denotata--as not themselves signs, but
as "things" to be denoted by semantic reference. Hence
what is called "pragmatics" is not only theoretically
antipragmatic, but also illogical for the same reasons that
Peirce showed in his critiques of immediate, dyadic
knowledge. The lack of theoretical soundness in Morris's
concept of "pragmatics," however, has not to date had an
impact on its normalization in linguistics and related fields
which employ the term."

"Hesitation on the linebreak" is simply a subcategory of "emphasis on the last
word before the linebreak."  There all all kinds of emphases (with all kinds
of agendas) that are possible.  Hesitation is one of them.

Well, now we know why that class was acting so "theoretically
antipragmatic" - thanks John. If the class was assuming with Morris that
"users of signs are not also themselves signs" then that would go along
way to explaining their discomfort w/ Ron's DEMO.  -m.

Gary Sullivan, tell me, if you know,
what you make of how Spicer's lines revise
Stevens':

The water never formed to mind or voice,
Like a body wholly body, fluttering
Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,
That was not ours, although we understood,
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.



If Spicer's linebreak at "No/One listens to poetry" allows you,
ambiguously, to understand the last line as a direction, or
perhaps radio signal, to listen, then the "No" also becomes
"Know":  No (linebreak)-- Know (this).  But even then, the next
line doesn't emphasize "One" (unless you mean entirely as a
matter of print, in which case someone's not listening); break
the line wherever you like, the stresses always fall on "no"
and "listens."

Adorno wrote his first article on jazz in 1936 and another came out in
1967, both inexcusably shitty.  Yes, he's reacting to what he saw as the
commercialized "pseudo-individualism" of the swing era - but, for
chrissake, the guy is a cultural critic, a historicist, and you would
think he'd be more careful.  Part of the problem, as far as I'm concerned,
is that Adorno's paragdigms don't fit particularly well on top of cultural
space like, say,  the Tulsa, Oklahoma of the late twenties and thirties -
one of the important sites where Kansas City-style swing is born.  This is
a radically improvisational culture: check out Count Basie's autobiography
*Good Morning Blues* or Ralph Ellison's essay "Going to the Territory" to
get a sense of just how off-base Adorno's thinking is in this case.

Adorno's contrasting of Stravinsky and the serialists was pretty standard
stuff back then and into the sixties. Stravinsky was the hero of the
mainstream (especially in the US and UK) and the bete noir of the rest of
us, in no small part because he positioned himself to fill those roles,
altho much of his late music is in fact serial (and quite wonderful). It's
nice that all those wars are over so that we can listen to both with pleasure.
Schoenberg, for one, was very interested in jazz. I would guess that
Adorno's reaction was partially conditioned by his general annoyance at
living in exile.
A piece of gossip: Louise Varese told me that Charlie Parker showed up at
the door unannounced one day in the last couple of years of his life and
asked to see Edgard. They had never met. The two of them disappeared into
Edgard's studio for the next six hours. Louise had no idea what transpired
there. Oh to be a fly on that wall!

In this case emphasis and stress are two different things. There's metrics
and there's grammatical placement which foregrounds. Even metrically
there's far more stress and quantity to the one at the beginning of a
grammatical structure and the one in no one."No. One listens to poetry."

Thank-you to all for the informative discussion of linguistic pragmatics
and experimental writing.  Just to clarify, I am a student in the class,
and the response to "D E M O" ("I think I'm being made fun of here") was
the prof.'s.  At the end of the class, my sense of things  was that
I was possibly suspected of trying to "sabotage" the course (which was
definitely *not* my intention) by introducing that poem.  Generally, it
seems that people doing pragmatics favor non-literary texts, especially
transcriptions of conversations, court procedings, etc.  Some interesting
work has been done with schizophrenic speech and writing (see "Crazy
Talk", by Rochester & Martin), through analysis of types of cohesive ties
in such language.

By no means do I want to position myself as any kind of authority on -- or
practioner of -- "linguistic pragmatics", though I may be able to offer
some background to this approach.

Pragmatics as I understand it is not related to Rand or Dewey, etc..  The
broadest possible definition would be that it concerns itself with
understanding texts as "intentional human actions" (hmmmm . . .).
Reference is treated as an act, and some key-words are deixis, "mutual
knowledge", presupposition, implicature, coherence, etc.  Apparently,
linguistic pragmatists (if that's what they are called) see themselves as
developing an approach to language which is in opposition to formal
linguistics (syntax & grammar).  Formal linguistics is criticized for
relying to heavily on "constructed examples" and "decontextualized
sentences" (The farmer killed the duckling), and also for searching for
grammar-based models of meaning -- such models are seen as attempts to
neutralize dissimilar contexts.

I am currently grappling with Deleuze and Guattari's account of pragmatics
in "A Thousand Plateaus", where pragmatics is equated with
"schizo-analysis" (146). This equation, of course, is  seen as
heretical by most pragmatists, though it is very interesting to someone
engaged with experimental writing.

I can suggest these books for people interested in the subject.  Not
really "recommended reading" . . . just course books:

Levinson, "Pragmatics".  Cambridge UP, 1983.

Brown and Yule, "Discourse Analysis".  Cambridge UP, 1983.

Halliday & Hasan, "Cohesion in English".  Longman, 1976.


Cheers,

Roger

A good book on Adorno and music is one with the unlikely title _The
Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play_. The author's name escapes me at the
moment, but the book is a reading of Frank Zappa's music using Adorno, and
conversely, a critique of Adorno using Zappa's work. It's interesting
because both Adorno and Zappa are, to say the least, problematic at times,
but it's a good attempt at using theory to illuminate popculture, and to
draw on more innovative aspects of popculture to interrogate theory.

At one point, though, the author criticizes (rightfully) Adorno's
limitations in dealing w/ popular culture by likening the reading of
Adorno writing on sunbathing (which TA does somewhere) to an experience of
being dowsed with laughing gas.

It also occurs to me that Curtis White has a short story called "Critical
Theory" which largely revolves around Adorno and Horkheimer driving to
California from New York shortly after emigrating here in the 40s.

I've read the later of Adorno's jazz essays, and fairly recently. He does
mention bebop, but only to say it makes no difference. I can sense an
irritation against European jazz connosieurs and certain claims for jazz
that would have seemed pretentious or inflated to him.

I don't buy arguments of the type "he was only thinking of the popular,
tin-pan alley kind of music." This is clearly not the case, and even if it
were, it wouldn't excuse him. He throws out the Basie with the bathwater
no matter how you look at it.

Hi, Mark,

Okay. Well, when I say out loud:

NO [linebreak] one LISTENS to poetry.

stressing where you say the stresses fall, the meaning I get, as heard is

NO [pause] one LISTENS to poetry.

I mean, as much as the other meanings resident/radiant there. Because
there's a line-break there, and I can't ignore it.

Anyway, I read it this way (among other ways) because, reading Spicer,
there's usually a lot going on in Spicer's poems: he does seem to really
play with meanings in the way that he breaks lines, in the words he chooses
(many of which tend to be puns). And, in this case, it wasn't even something
I had to think about. I just saw it there and went, "Oh ... well, how come
everyone always says Spicer only says the opposite of this?" or whatever.

I think it would interesting to think what it might mean, how it might
inform the rest of the poem (& the rest of the poems in _Language_) if we DO
take that last line as "One listens to poetry."

No?

Gary

Yes, reconsider - if "The broadest possible definition would be that it
concerns itself with understanding texts as "intentional human actions"
(hmmmm . . .). Reference is treated as an act, and some key-words are
deixis, "mutual knowledge", presupposition, implicature, coherence, etc."
then there's an obvious debt here to Dewey, Wittgenstein, Burke and others
basically involved with philosophical pragmatism, and "language as
symbolic action."    -m.

Yes.

I'd already agreed the linebreak can do what
you say with the "no," but not that it puts
emphasis on ONE LISTENS.  If the poem stresses
listening, then a listener--not merely a reader--
would hear the natural stress in "one LISTens": it's
the listening, not the one who listens, that matters.
It's a language thing.

Robert Pinsky, in his new little book _The Sounds of Poetry_, argues that
readers shouldn't pause at the ends of lines.  They should follow the
syntax, and "pause only as the grammar might pause."  According to his
theory, printed lines are a "notation" that should assist in making
apprehensible the "vocal rhythms" already inherent in a work.
Interestingly, his example is William Carlos Williams's "To a Poor Old
Woman," which contains the well-known lines:

They taste good to her
They taste good
to her. They taste
good to her

You can see it...

Pinsky seems to say that the different rhythms and emphases of the "They
taste good to her" variations manifest a "vocal alertness" that parallels
the "sensory alertness" of the poem's speaker.  The rhythmic differences
are already "there" in the sentence; Williams's enjambment just makes us
more likely to notice them (it heightens our perception of sound).

Spicer's ironic splitting of "no one" seems similar (since it is a
variation on an earlier line): it makes you "listen" to poetry.

To speak of "hesitation" when syntax and line are in tension seems overly
melodramatic.  Why aren't all instances of enjambment "hesitations"?  I
think I agree with Pinsky that enjambment helps to show where the accents
are distributed in a given sentence.  It doesn't signify a dramatic pause.

Then Pinsky's apparently recycling his own writing.
He made the same argument, with the same example, in
his review of Williams' _Collected_.  But "To a Poor
Old Woman" is the easy textbook case of what free verse
supposedly does with enjambment. What can enjambment
bring to "vocal alertness" about a line that's not
repeated?  In most verse, enjambment doesn't show
anything about "accents," especially if you don't
pause at linebreaks.  Maybe I'll look at Pinsky's new book
to see if he enjambs his own argument differently in this
printing.

I always look closer to right avant-gardening than apres-gardening.This is
really a lie disguised as a clever lie, since I have no garden.
Besides, I keep trying to be left and still ending up wrong.


"Robert Pinsky, in his new little book _The Sounds of Poetry_, argues that

syntax, and "pause only as the grammar might pause."  According to his

This is something that's always sort of bugged me. When I was a kid, I was
taught to read through line breaks. Don't pause at the end of the line, it
makes it sing-songy. Then I became a "poet" and was taught to pause at line
breaks, to break the line where pausing. My general rule has become, if it's
old and rhymed, don't pause, if it's newer, do pause, unless that doesn't seem
to work, etc. In others words, it seems that one has to read the poem first in
order to figure out how to go back and read it. Also, the line-break pause
always seems to me to have more of the back of the throat in it than a
strictly punctuational pause.

I remember a workshop where one participant spent the whole semester
commenting on everyone's line breaks. Re. Pinsky, though, isn't the line break
itself _part_ of the grammar of poetry?

Pause,
Laura W.

I'm not sure I follow Andrew or Pinsky.  To me the reader should stop
where the words stop, partly to let what has just been read seep in
deeper, partly to read the preceding line as a completed whole of some
sort.  In the Williams poem the line-breaks leave us thinking first
about her, then about good, then about taste, then back to her--or,
really, "good to her" as a solid block of meaning now.  I don't see why
any "vocal rhythms" in the text would be made more apprehensible by line
breaks that one doesn't pause at.

Of course, I have a vested interest here: my whole definition of poetry
depends on what I call "flow-breaks" such as standard line-breaks; they
are what for me distinguish poetry from prose.

Line endings have different functions in different poems and poets. part of
the fun of a new poem  or poet is figuring out the music. Any blanket
statement seems foolish to me. And the example Pinsky uses is idiotic--no
question here about the pause at the linebreaks. Somebody should send the
guy a telegram about breath groups.
Incidentally, check out his poem in the new NYRB--how not to write a poem.
Good piece by Geertz, tho.

As I have no ear for jazz I find Adorno quite useful for tweaking the noses
of the high minded:

"Yet none of this alters the fact that jazz has in its essence remained
static, nor does it explain the resulting enigma that millions of people
seem never to tire of its monotonous attraction."

"The range of the permissible in jazz is as narrowly circumscribed as in any
particular cut of clothes."

"Anyone who allows the growing respectability of mass culture to seduce him
into equating a popular song with modern art because of a few false notes
squeaked by a clarinet; anyone who mistakes a triad studded with 'dirty
notes' for atonality, has already capitulated to barbarism."

"In the process of integrating the asocial, jazz converges with the equally
standardized schemas of the detective novel and its offshoots, which
regularly distort or unmask the world so that asociality and crime become
the everyday norm, but which at the same time charm away the seductive and
ominous challenge through the inevitable triumph of order."

Adorno, "Perennial Fashion--Jazz" in PRISMS

Is this the final word on jazz?  Of course not.  Have Adorno's words in fact
had any appreciable influence on jazz?  Again, of course not.  Is he right
about some aspects of jazz and jazz listeners?  Oh yes, quite right.  I've
owned a record store for twenty years and have listened to a fair amount of
jazz and jazz talk:  some of it stimulating, some of it fatuous.  The
danger, and the beauty as well, of this essay is that you can substitute for
"jazz" most any identifiable style of music, monkey with a few of the
definitions and pronouncements, and come up with something suitable to piss
just about anyone off.

Re: Spicer -

"Meaning," it seems to me, as definitive, is precisely what the poem moves
up against, resists, crashes into, and recedes from (the opposite of
meaning as fluid). The ocean figures rather traditionally in Spicer's work
- as an image of formlessness or chaos (I'm thinking in particular of
Spicer's use of the image in the earlier books, say, _Admontions_ or _A
Book of Music_). Or, in "Lament for the Makers:"

No call upon anyone but the timber drifting in the waves
Those blocks, those blobs of wood.
The sounds there, offshore, faint and short
They click or sound together - drift timber spending the night
        there floating just above this beach. Thump or sound
        together. The sound of driftwood the sound that is not
        really a sound at all.
At all
All of them
Cast
In the ghost of moonlight upon them
On shore.


This strikes me as Spicer's image of the poem's elements (wood/would/word
in sound), but also of the serial method (i.e. one might read timber blocks
as each a poem knocking up against others). It's synathesthetic, and I
would hesitate to say that Spicer had meant simply that one must "listen to
the sound it makes." (Pound), or that he was claiming something of an
oral/aural nature. It is, after all, an _image_ (the elements of which
recur ceaselessly in Spicer's poetry, as if to insist on the drift).

As for the poem at hand, line breaks, etc: how about "no ONE listens to
poetry" (i.e. that there must be more than one)? Or what about the status
of "The ocean does not _mean_," or, "It means [break] Nothing." (i.e. that
NOTHING might be meaningful). These all, I think, are legitimate readings,
and offer above all a hesitation with respect to literality (is it possible
that a pun be read literally?)

On line breaks, in any case, from _Admonitions_:


When you break a line nothing
Becomes better.
There is no new (unless you are humming
Old Uncle Tom's Cabin) there is no new
Measure.
You breathe the same and Rimbaud
Would never even look at you.
Break
Your poem
Like you would cut a grapefruit
Make
It go to sleep for you
And each line (There is no Pacific Ocean) And make each line
Cut itself. Like seaweed thrown
Against a pier.


I don't know what this means with respect to the present discussion (it's
clearly a critique of Olson's Projectivism, Olson being always the
literalist _and_ oralist, and, of course, the very "public" figure who
insisted that he be listened to). But the poem as adrft in no ocean at all?
I don't know...


Let me know,

Stephen

Subject:      Re: Line breaks
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I think Aviva Vogel has the right thing to say about line breaks:  it's not
just a matter of hesitation or of emphasis on the last word before the line-
break. There are all kinds of emphases.

I've studied this fairly closely with linguistic machinery reading out voice
traces, though I concentrated for ease of analysis mostly on poetry with
traditional metrics.  For example, if you take this line break from Henry
Vaughan:

                When shall that cry
'The bridegroom's coming' fill the sky?
Shall it in the evening run
When our words and works are done
Or will thy all surprising light
Break at midnight.

There is no hesitation and not much difference in emphasis between "run" and
"when" and there is no break in sound at all between those two words (at least
in my own performance of them).  Yet a definite sense of line break is given.
How?  Well, only partly by the rhyme scheme and syntax, I think (note, the
rhyme has not yet come but may be anticipated).  What happens is that the
voicing (buzzing of the larynx) is continuous between "run" and "when" because
of the nasalisation and the fact that the lips can form the "w" without
interrupting the nasal tones.  What causes the sensation of line break in this
case is the *timing* of that lip movement:  that is, the hesitation, if you
like, is created within the sounding of the line by using different parts of
the vocal apparatus.  The lips move to form the "wh" but the "wh" formation is
not a precise moment either: something conceptual also takes place, siting the
moment of break as if mathematically within the change of sound from nose to
lips.

The traces show what the ear hears: the sounding of the line is virtually
continuous from "Shall" to "words" and the actual pauses come between "words"
and "and", between "works" and "are" and between "are" and "done".  This is
because the voicing in the larynx is broken at those times by silence imposed
by shifts in the vocal apparatus and/or by the interruption of voiceless
consonants into the voicing (which can give a sensation of semi-pause
exploitable, also, for line-breaks).

The importance of voice in creating the pacing of poetry (not to mention its
several other effects) is little understood, in my opinion.  For example, the
impressive pausing in "Break     at     midnight" is much a creature of the
interaction between voiceless consonants "k" especially, and the the
continuous, heavy voicing possible in "midnight", plus pause-creating changes
in sound position in the mouth.

There are many ways of creating line breaks and the break itself is almost
infinitely variable in its quasi-duration".  You can, for example, create a
line break with voiceless consonants but this can become a complex question of
duration.  In Creeley's famous poem

drive, he sd, for
christ's sake, look
out where yr going

the line break from "for" to "christ" is formed by the staccato onset of
"christ" in the back of the throat, though the "r" can be drawled to create a
tension about when the line is ending.  Had Creeley made the break between
"christ's" and "sake" it would then become a question of how long to continue
the continuous hissing until a sense of line closure was achieved -- that
would be an infinitesimal decision relative to any one single reading of the
poem, but there would be no pause in sounding of the voiceless fricatives --
the break could be indicated by a sense that the hissing had gone on "long
enough".

This kind of thing (the immersion of rule in practice, always) is, to take up
that other thread, what pragmatics means to me in terms of linguistics or
prosody: all ideas come down to their situational usage, and you can't create
a positivistic or symbolic logic that will finally work.  The appearance of
pragmatics as a buzz word was easy to anticipate from philosophical trends of
the 1980s, but I personally think poets already have this approach to their
craft:  it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing, and so on.

Isn't Deleuze's radicalisation of possibility not so much schizoid as
radically incoherent?  I'm not a philosopher, so I ask this as a humble
question, not an attack, as my readings in Deleuze are fairly shallow.  I have
a sense that he could be assailed in a way analogous to the assault on
Husserl's transcendental ego: that possibility is entrailed in determinism and
vice-versa and we are really talking about points on a spectrum rather than a
movement into (a probably fictive) schizo-possibility.

The question of the articulated linebreak never quite goes away. We have
extremes -- Duncan actually counting to three between each line in his
readings of Passages in 1970, the inaudible ones that Pinsky argues for --
and a million possible middle positions. I tend to side with Grumman here --
if there's no point to a linebreak, why break it? If there is a point,
shouldn't it be sounded? But in practice in my readings I vary, sometimes
being very strict about voicing them, then other times quite the opposite.
It seems to me one of the decisions that turns the printed text literally
into a score that may be performed.

Yes, I would certainly agree that in performing a poem (even if only to
oneself when silently reading it), there are times to disregard the
line-break as a place to pause.  Also times TO pause in the middle of
lines that aren't indicated in any overt way at all in the poem.

The other ambiguity created by the stanza break, of course, in the ultrafamous
Creeley poem cited by Doug Oliver (we go to forge in the smithies of our
brains the uncreated anthologies of our erase), is whether "drive" is spoken
by the "he" or the "I". Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd thought
Creeley had said most people automatically assume the new stanza starts with
an imperative by Not John, and that ain't necessarily so.

gary,
do you think this poem was written after listening to the recording of
Pound reading the first canto, set keel to breakers etc. Do you think it
matters. There's a lot about baseball in Language do you think Spicer was
referring to Homer, as Pound was.

Really a nice piece on line breaks from Doug Oliver.  I find that there are
numerous ways to handle line breaks "right" (that is, surprisingly and
satisfyinging). I find myself relishing the EFFECTIVE use of voice in
performance.  A frequent affectation is the overdoing of the pause in line
breaks lacking punctuation, as though the standard pause will cover the
situation.  And it does not.  There's a delicious art to this.  It might even
relate to allowing the intuition to do this FOR one, rather than forcing
something that (however well intentioned) is simply magnified and spoiled in
the effort.

Some short poems that "open worlds" here. And, re: Linebreaks,
especially with Joanne's work (actually, line placement on the page for
her), is phanopoeia, the play of light and darkness on the page. Whether
one reads through the break or not, it spares the eye the heavy burden
of prose blocks. My humble opinion anyway, although even prose blocks
can have their place...

On a vaguely related note, who here listens to music when they are reading
poetry? Is it always distracting, gumming up or hijacking the rhythms of
the poetry, or are there certain types of music which go well with certain
poets?

The question struck me since I was reading O'Hara at home yesterday, first
with Philip Glass in the background, then with the Propellerheads. I should
probably have listened to jazz, or perhaps Rachmaninoff, but both of the
above seemed somehow appropriate.

Also, are their certain types of music that you like to listen to when
writing? I write mostly in cafes, where they're bound to be playing Massive
Attack or Portishead, and that undoubtedly affects my writing. What if I
always wrote to Mancini, or Kraftwerk, or the Prodigy?

Vaughan is writing in song-form, which was closely related to dance. The
metrics are full of the kinds of surprises and syncopations that one would
expect in Dowland or Campion. And there is, as in those two, an acute
attention to quantity.
Note, in this regard, that shall and when can be read as lightly stressed,
and just as easily interpreted as first syllables of an anapest as of a
trochee. What you have, then, is a spondee opening the short line, the
second line in iambic tetrameter, the next two of much shorter
duration--almost breathless, introduced by those dancing anapests--in
trimeter, another much longer line in iambic tetrameter, and a trochaic
dimeter cadence to the final couplet.
No matter how you read the emphasis (by which I assume you mean stress) of
run and when, run remains much longer in duration.

Mark Weiss's remarks on Vaughan very interesting -- I agree about the
influence from Elizabethan song, the sense of a poem turning on the ball of
the foot.

Mine was not a contribution to the question of line breaks in total: it was
only a look at traditional metrics insofar as they enlighten us about modern
practices.  I fully take Dale's good point about positioning on page and all
the rest of our modern subtleties.  As our mag, Gare du Nord, has recently
argued -- Joanne is firmly cited in this respect, Anne Waldman could be
another -- the positioning of words on the page bears a mysterious and
captivating trace of a poetry-life-lived.

My word "emphasis" is not to be confused with "stress", however.  I meant by
it whatever way we emphasise a line break -- either through actual pause,
shift in mouth position, change of pitch (which I didn't mention), or any of
the many other ways, including how the line looks print, emphasis through
bodily gesture in performance, etc. etc.

I was not, in fact, conducting traditional scansion at all, just looking at
the literal traces left by the voice on linguistic machinery.  How a word is
stressed, light or heavy, is one of those infinitesimally adjustable features
depending on any one reader's single performance of a particular line.
Traditional scansion can only capture this crudely.

Shall it in the evening run
When our words and works are done

f Mark wants to say that "when" or "shall" in the Vaughan poem can be a light
stress, or that there's a spondee or anapest, or that "run" should be a long
duration, I'd say "Fine, if that's the way you're hearing it right now."
(Though I'm not clear which "when" or "shall" he refers to because both words
occur earlier.)  You can place heavy or light stresses when reading these
words at your will, either respecting their basic metrical status or not -- an
American voice may do this differently from an English one: "run", for
example, will more naturally extend in American than in English English, I
suspect.

It remains that the degree of stress will still be infinitely variable
depending upon expectations set up by a particular reading -- no scansion will
be secure or perhaps very revealing. (In linguistics a couple called Trager
and Smith set up the heresy that there were only a set number of stress
weightings.  Their error was to measure subjects' reactions to fragmented
samples in a laboratory, thus missing the whole use of language in poetic flow
and performance.  Linguists love this kind of definiteness.)

The basic problem with traditional metrics is that the relationship between
stress and duration of syllable is very poorly understood, since any feature
(pitch, loudness, tempo, past or future of the cadence on either side of a
syllable, etc.) that gives a stress its lightness or heaviness is inseparable
from duration. Our sense of a stress is also semantically or emotionally
freighted.  Quantity, which Mark mentions, is a term which slightly straddles
duration, stress, orthography, and semantics; its definition is therefore
equally difficult.

The ambiguity between stress and duration is why the French can work with
abstract syllable count and the commonest English tradition with stress count:
the resultant music is different but both poetries "work" in a similar way --
beat and duration and pitch and voice quality and loudness/softness and
meaning and emotional significance, and so on, all, truly speaking,
inextricable.  Since pitch is involved in stress/duration, I don't suppose
Chinese poetry is all that different *in its basic manner of creating affect,
either* though obviously the idiogrammatic prosody will create a perhaps very
different mental process.  As Pound hoped. The grammatical role of tones makes
a further difference.

It is all this play across different poetic features, in fact, which leads us
onwards into modern practices where the resulting ambiguities and
uncertainties can be placed into tension through various procedures, perhaps
including those areas where performance, concrete, sound, visual, filmic, and
printing techniques interlace with poetry.  This offers some hope about
creating meeting grounds between the poetries of different cultures and about
spreading appreciation of novelty.

From the same issue of the NY Times Book Review (online at least -- I've not
seen the hard copy) that has its cover review by Robert Kelly, that admits
that Brad Leithauser's poetry may have some limitations and that Robert
Bly's most recent book is just silly (these are different reviews, by the
way), is a brief review by Rick Whitaker of Edwin Denby's new _Dance
Writings and Poetry_ just out from Yale. Here is the entire comment on
Denby's poetry: "The poems seem dated and quaint."

Duane, this is tripe.  Would you ever give *any* literary critic props for
arguing that *some* poetry is bad/bad news.  This is essentially what your
praise of Adorno amounts to: like a stroke of lightening at midnight he
has discovered that some jazz is bad.  Well, no shit.  But as cultural
critics there's a special imperative on us not to drown in our own
ill-informed generalizations, thus adding fuel to the fire of criticism
that we put cart before horse & don't usually know whereof we speak.  The
truth is, Adorno just dropped the ball here (now I'm really mixing
metaphors at a furious pace) and we should be able to appreciate his many
positive efforts w/out holding his drunk ass up at this particular party.

I appreciate Douglas' generous words about metrics, especially regarding
the use of more traditional elements to create tension in contemporary
poems. He writes:

Ed Sanders, in an "essay on poetics" called CREATIVITY AND THE FULLY
DEVELOPED BARD, devotes a chapter to meter that I have found useful. He
writes:



No bard is fully realized

              without a knowledge of meter



It's as simple as that--

You can groan, "Ah, Sanders, desist! desist!"

but it's true.



You have to SING into your clusters

where the vowels carry the melody

and the consonants,

              those click-tracks of infinity,

                                   are the percussion.



All poetry can be parsed

                    into patterns of classic meter--



and bards DO hold syllables quantitatively

as they read or chant.



Tones rise as they read,

tones change as they end a line--

                          sometimes it's subtle.



Sanders then lists some of the main classical meters before looking
closely at poems that use these in varying combinations, forming tension
and flow of sound to correlate with other elements involved with each
piece. In a poem of Whitman's, he shows how various classical meters are
released for a desired (conscious? unconscious?) effect:



Out of the cradle endlessly rocking  (twin adonics)



Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle   (dactyl and
paean)



Out of the Ninth-month midnight,



Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child



         leaving his bed wander'd alone, bareheaded, bare foot,



Down from the shower'd halo   (choriambs)



Sorry I can't mark the meters in this format, but you get the idea. The
sound and rhythm shifts to reenforce the meaning of the line, as in the
dull rocking rhythm of the first.



Anyway, it's all very interesting. I'm not sure where to find the
Sanders piece. I have a xeroxed copy here.

linguist-rhetoricians who maintain w/o concession that "words are strictly
thus & so," ergo should be taught thus & so-ly [wink]---which inevitably
leaves out of the brew so many things poetic, along with so much that is
rightfully a part of language practice...

of course some poets aver thus & so-ly as well... but there is just SO
much to a "simple" line break, yknow, depends on who's doing the listening

Thank you, Doug. I'm intrigued with the idea of poem as "score," which necessarily
implies performance -- or does it? Anne Waldman's work is a good example of this,
existing in both realms. From a musician's perspective, the score is but a
skeleton of potential performance. It's also something studied intently, read and
re-read, scribbled on, pondered over. (Satie, by the way, wrote incredible
"directions" to the performer, such as "as if to be a hole.") And once one's
decided what something in the score "means" there's still the matter of how to
convey that. Is an accent expressed in length, volume, force of attack, altered
attack, etc. This sort of interpretation is what makes music "musical."

Poetry, it seems, must be capable of its own "musicality" _without_ the skilled
interpreter, i.e. on its own on the page. The reader, in this sense, is the
performer. What a responsibility! How much scoring can really come across? when
does it detract or confuse? How much ambiguity is just enough?

Music as we usually conceive of it exists only in time. Is the score music or not
music? Does poetry exist outside of time? I think it does, but I can't get at why
or how. My rationalizing seems to suggest the opposite. But poetry's not rational?
Or is that a cop-out? Anyway, it makes such a difference to my reading if I've
heard the author's voice. Do we write for our own voice, as Beethoven wrote for
the piano, or for any voice, as much Baroque music was written?

Anyone out there know much about Th. Merton's little magazine, _Monks
Pond_, which ran 4 issues during 1968, the final of which Merton himself
did not live to read?

I just found an incredible 9x12 facsimile edition of all four issues in
the commons here in Ithaca.  Cannot believe the eclecticism of these issues.

Anselm Hollo, Paul Metcalf, Zukofsky, Jonathan Williams, Simon Perchik,
Kerouac, Russell Edson, Merton hisself, Simic, even Mark Van Doren, Wendell
Berry, Czeslaw Milosz.  This is great!  (Few women, though: Lorine
Niedecker, Margaret Randall, Lindy Hough, Nancy-Lou Patterson, Dorothy
Beck, Gail Waechter, Sister M. Therese).

Not exactly an answer but the act of adjusting the spaces between letters
is called kerning so I guess that the space is a kern. The dictionary says
that a kern is "the portion of the typeface beyond the body or shank of a
character." A kern is also "a Medieval Scottish or Irish foot soldier" and
"a loutish person." I guess this is why the language we speak is called
*English*. Wouldn't the act of adjusting the spaces between words be
called justifying? Letter-press people? Does that make the space a "just"?

Adornos like the impertinence of line breaking. A Perelmen fetished
marginalization of.

Jameson's _Adorno, Or the Persistence of the Dialectic_ is aptly titled. To feel,
viscerally, that dialectic, these days, you have to kinda trip on Adorno as
Adorno. (And, you know, we're all looking for a 'good'  'relationship'.) The
Persistence of Adorno. But why not have that little affected antithesis while
getting off on a little syncopated negro transcendence illusion. and allll that
jazz. Petulant, pessimism and stoic enjambment can, like, get yous over your own
consumer identifications. EVen way over there. in that poet-niche.

Maybe it is a LATE STAGE with its own cultural logics of this historical mode of
production. At least as much as all that sweetness and light. And ALL the spaces
are temporality cause we don't have history anymores. We don't have time. All
crowded out. Breath, One, Two, Three.

Michael, Dude, lighten up...

You seem to have missed the point here:  I wrote that I found Adorno on jazz
to be "useful" -- which is not the same thing as "praise."  How "useful"
Adorno is in "tweaking the noses of the high minded" is wonderfully evident
in your priggish response...

Let me, briefly, set out in a somewhat clearer form the point you were
trying to make:  What makes Adorno's essay on jazz bad is indeed its lack of
specificity.  Adorno has not defined his subject nor deigned to narrow or
limit its scope.  Thus, what appear to be some trenchant comments on a
particular musical form are lost in this lack of focus.  As I pointed out in
my own message, this essay employs a kind of cookie cutter approach:
Adorno's comments here are not all that different from comments he made
regarding other cultural productions, but, in this case, Michael, you appear
to disagree with him while elsewhere you "appreciate his many positive
efforts."  Its dawning on me that a better theme song for you than a Duke
Ellington number might be Leslie Gore's "It's My Party And I'll Cry If I
want To."

Bill:  I think the basic term is "em," which is the square of the type body
size, also known as an "em space" or "quad."  In twelve point type, a quad
is 12 points wide by 12 points deep.  An "en quad" is 1/2 an em, or 6
points wide by 12 points deep.  Other spaces for 12 point are the 3 em
space, which is 4 points wide, the 4 em space (3 points wide), etc.  The
space between lines is called leading, while kerning (in linotype, at
least) is the projection of one letter, such as a lower-case "f" over
another.

This comes from "The Design of Books" by Adrian Wilson.

there probably is -- but in 19 years of setting type and making books,
including early study with walter hamady of such matters -- I never heard
it called anything but "wordspacing."

Justifying is usually limited to adjusting lines so that they line up
evenly on both the left and right margin. That is accomplished by adjusting
word spaces -- but can be accomplished by adding minute spacing material
between individual letters; also can be accomplished (in prose, not
poetry), by adjusting the total length of line until an appropriate length
is found which both 'looks' right and which allows for easiest
justification. And if you're the writer of a piece you're typesetting, then
a lot can be done to help justification by re-writing. But no, the act of
adjusting individual spaces between words is not called justifying. Nor is
it called kerning. A space is not a just and a space between words is not a
kern.

One tries to stick with a consistent spacing between words as much as
possible -- say, if using 12-point type, with 4-em  or 5-em spaces,
depending on individual preference. A 12-point em being a piece of spacing
which is 12points by 12points square. It takes four 4-em spaces to make an
em (also called a "quad"). Some of the terminology is mathematical (sort
of) then, some is certainly odd and antiquated, but some is pretty clear,
like letterspacing and wordspacing. In the practice as I know it, the term
kerning is usually limited to reducing space between letters by actually
trimming, with a special trimmer, that space "beyond the body or shank of a
character," while expanding the space between letters to achieve desired
effects and proportions is called letterspacing. The latter generally
happens a lot more often than the former.

it makes sense to me, hugh & bill, that this would be the case in linotype.
Because this is what happens in monotype, too, if one takes kerning as the
cutting away of the edge of the body of a letter, in order to fit letters
closer together. But I'm sure glad that there are characters such as
ligatures (letter-combinations cast as a single piece of metal type),
particularly for the combinations "ff," "fi," "ffl," and "ffi" -- because
otherwise you really can't fit those letters together without potentially
breaking part of the letter.

With other combinations with "f," though, the situation is pretty simple in
monotype. On the "f" the form of the top curve of the letter actually
extends beyond the base of the piece of type, and thus the letter naturally
fits over other lower-case letters except for ones with tall straight
ascenders.

I don't think anyone would use an "em" as a space between words, though --
it would make for particularly huge spaces between words, big enough to
look pretty awkward. Lots of lettepress typesetters use 4-em spaces between
words; quite a few use 3-em spaces between words; and a few use as thin a
space as a 5-em space between words.

Appreciated all the contributions, and liked Dale's reminder of Ed the
Sanders' grace with classical meters.

Laura's point about the poem as score certainly chimes with my own notions,
but I'm curious to know what apparent "fixities" of sound reside in the score
to enable any interpretation at all.  A German linguist called Sievers back in
the 1920s managed to distinguish what he called the neutral music residing in
printed lines of speech -- that is, the music the words *would have* if
readers gave them no special emphasis or interpretation.  It's a tantalising
concept because, of course, every reader has a different voice, dialect,
emotional tone, spirit, and will always interpret the words differently to at
least some degree.  Also, as I have found, even the same reader (me) may
differ from himself in performance of the same lines of poetry across, say, a
two year gap *more than* some other competent reader differed from (my)
original performance.

I don't really believe science can do more than touch the hem of such
questions (I'm not a filfthy British empiricist).  Yet I have tested this
sense we might have of a neutral music in a poem by comparing different
readers performing some lines of Pope's -- I chose Pope because the more
formal the match of line to preordained metrics is the more likely it is that
there will be consonance between different readers' performances of the same
poem.  I recorded seven readings and submitted them to two or three panels of
listeners who judged which readings made the "best basic music" for the poem
in question.

My conclusions from the intonation/duration traces were that three or four
readers judged as "good" seem to discern elements of a neutral tune the words
*could have* if they were performed neutrally (though of course this is
impossible).  There was sufficient convergence between the performances for
this conclusion to seem secure, at least for these lines of Pope's.  If there
really were a neutral tune that would be the score we are looking for.

The next bit's complicated.  I don't think a neutral tune exists as a score,
but that each good, orthodox performance of Pope's lines will set up an
expectation of a roughly similar neutral tune, a dim sense of a tune probably
specifically arising as a ground base during that individual performance.  But
there will be a neutral tune suggested by each individual performances:  for
example, even if the same reader performs the lines again, he/she may start
the next time at a slightly higher pitch, and this will change all the note
values which follow.  Nevertheless, these ground base tunes, though they may
vary slightly from reader to reader and from performance to performance, may
verge towards identity, again if the metrics is fairly strict.  The machine
traces showed that, and the result was just about the same with lines by
Wyatt, and others by Ronsard, read by French speakers.  But the neutral tune
is a figment, a possibility arising only at the precise time of performance:
the actual performance must depart from that neutral music if it is to have
any real life and not be merely metronomic.  These departures are what we call
interpretation -- the necessary varying from neutrality in order to give life.

Re-emphasis: there is not one neutral tune, but there is similarity between
the ground base musics set up by various performances, musics from which the
performances depart in order to create interpretation.

So that I don't offend too far against reader response freaks, let me add that
I also believe that a talented different interpretation of the lines, which
departs much more radically from the commonly perceived neutral music, may be
equally valid.  (But this does not include the average actor hamming up a poem
and losing its music.)

Where the metrics are more difficult for average readers to perceive, as in so
much modern work, it's much harder to compare readings and find a shared sense
of neutral music.  This is because for there to be any agreement over what
tune to make in a performance there has pretty much to be identity of
interpretation (as is also true even with traditional metrics).  So it's
chicken and egg: if you agree with me pretty fully on interpretation of the
words you will make a similar tune -- providing we are both competent readers
from a similar dialect group; but if you make a similar tune that will imply
we agree pretty fully on interpretation.  Poetry which deliberately hands much
of the interpretation task over to the reader -- as in poems where the
"signifier floats free", etc. -- may therefore fall outside testability.
Although if we found that two readers made the same tune in performance, this
might open up interesting discussion about interpretation of the poem in
question.

Yet I would still hold to the further corollary: if my chicken and egg picture
is correct, it still means that any one performance even of a poem whose
interpretation is open will sense that it is creating the possibility of an
unexpressive neutral tune, specific to that performance and underlying its
actual vocal interpretation.  My justification is: if that were not so, how
would the performer know how to create expressive effects by, say, raising
pitch slightly, increasing loudness, extending syllable duration?  I don't see
how interpretation can take place in a void or how expressive affect can occur
psychologically without some tension being created between actual sound and
our sense of a musical grounding. That is, how could the performer interpret
the piece at all?

This is open to accusations of Platonism, but that would be incorrect.
Despite Sievers and Plato, the "neutral tune" doesn't exist, any more than
pure possibility or "Idea" exist: it's an ineffable will o' the wisp that we
necessarily create as we perform and, in that sense, resides in the poem as a
"score" reawakened in its possibilities each time.  If we hardened it into a
concrete poem-score with notation, as with music and as many poets have
suggested at various times, we should be choosing more exactly what ground
music to apply, as best as possible, to any individual performance of the
poem.  That might be interesting.  But I think part of the magic of poetry --
and its difference from music -- is that the score (or ground music, or
neutral music) is recreated in slightly different form at each reading,
hovering under the voice so to speak.  Poetry is, therefore, easier to perform
really badly than music is, for at least a clumsy musician is trying to hit
the right notes.

The definiteness and pedantry in my tone is only because I want to be clear
about what I realise are mostly just complicated personal beliefs backed up
somewhat by the fragility of a supposed empiricism -- more, an impressionistic
use of quasi-scientific procedures.  I find these matters really difficult.

That's interesting. I've tried 2 beats on the line break, and 3 between
verses. I like the 3-beat pause, but I couldn't get over the fact that I
was pausing where there was no overt pause - but that an emphasis on the
last word before the line-break served to emphasize the line-break. Works
for me.

This is my biggest failing in performance. Also, adrenalin pushes puases,
compresses, speeds up, flows.

I guess I'm agreeing with everything said here :)

I am not well versed in letterpress, but my typesetting experience
(1979-91) leads me to a 'thin' as the space between words, an 'en' at
2/3rds and an 'em' as the full size of a cap M in the relevant type size
and face. Kerning is the shaving off (physically in letterpress,
electronically nowadays) of the metal that holds the lettershape, so that
the next letter can be shoved closer. The distance between VA for example
on the grid of your screen or on the grid of letter press will look too
gappy. So the metal setting of one letter (or both) is shaved off to enable
them to be shoved together. Justification means putting enough thins, ens
and ems between words (or even between letters) to spread the word out to
the full extent of the line. I have never heard of a 'just', or a 'kern',
and don't expect to again!

Duane, I must say I felt light as a feather, unpredictable as the
weather, in my response, and as for being priggish,
congratulations, your the first person every to accuse me of such
(can one be both priggish and "unclear"? I thought clarity and
priggishness were the best of friends).  As for my theme song, I've always
been more of a "it's *your* party and I'll *crash* if I want to" kind of
guy.  Playfully peeved was really the tone I was hoping to strike - peeved
(playfully, remember) more than anything else, at the way you prefaced
your original statement, "As I have no ear for jazz, I find Adorno quite
useful..." - we should all listen harder to what we have no ear for.  -m.

Formal Strategy of Text


So in order to construct a "sondheim-text" or "real/virtual" text, one
might proceed as follows, beginning with (real/virtual) entities A and B:
Given these constructs* (cultural or natural, defined or discovered, meta-
phoric or metonymic) with determined affinities belonging to a set S, con-
sider a second set C and D, with affinities in S'. Ordinarily, one might
have a situation in which S and S' are roughly equivalent, in relation to
some measure of fuzziness. But let there be foreign elements which are
members of S', and lapses in S corresponding to elements of S. Further,
note that we are also considering, roughly syntactically, two further
elements for both pairs (a total of four in all), that is A(B) and B(A),
as well as C(D) and D(C). These _chiasms_ then possess their own attribute
sets, call them T and T' and each of these have their subsets - for exam-
ple one has A(B) and B(A) both contributory towards T, such that they
possess a core or _rope_ R(A(B), B(A)) - the thickness of the chiasm or
reversal thus indicated. We can roughly identify R with T, and likewise R'
with T'. However, T' is broken, inexact, which is to say that the parallel
rope of the chiasm R'(C(D), D(C)) is in disarray, wandering, vagrant. It
is this turn which constitutes the strategy of avatars and duals loose or
perturbing within the interpenetrated component structures of computer-
mediated-communication; and it is this turn which then constitutes the
subject and object, strategy and wager, of the real/virtual texts involv-
ing multiple persons and avatars.
____________________________________________________________

*Of course the following oppositions or pairs are problematic, the art,
such as it is, consists in choosing, first, sufficiently rich A and B, and
second, in deciding the domains (pairs) and attributes. It is within these
decision that the psychoanalytical and socio-cultural unfoldings occur,
more or less set in formal motion.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I came across reference in an old discography to a recording by "Ted
Adorno and the Frankfut 5."  According to my sketchy information this
featured Adorno on piano, Max Horkheimer on drums, and the plaintive
clarinet of Walt Benjamin on "Sweet Lorraine" and "What did I do to be so
black and Blue."  No information available on the bass or trumpet. While
Horkheimer can swing somewhat, Adorno's playing is rather stiff, as though
he couldn't quite get the rhythm down.

Anyone have any information on these rare recordings?

Call for papers:

Innovation and Experimentation in Contemporary American Poetry

What criteria delimit the margins of American poetry today?  What is the
role of the lyric and narrative in the elliptical, fragmented and
disjunctive approach utilized by many contemporary poets. How has Language
poetry given way or split off from other "experimental" poetries and how do
gender and race figure into those divergence's? How has performance poetry
altered, popularized or skirted the "poetry establishment"?  What projects
have poets undertaken to analyze, bridge, or deconstruct the mutually
marginal spheres of "high" and "low" poetry today?

We particularly invite papers on poets such as, Rae Armantrout, Lucy
Brock-Broido, Anne Carson, Lynn Emanuel, Elaine Equi, Jorie Graham,
Barbara Guest, Lyn Hejinian, Brenda Hillman, Susan Howe, Ann Lauterbach,
Bernadette Meyer, Jane Miller, Tracie Morris, Harryette Mullen, Alice
Notely, Susan Wheeler, and
others.

This three-day conference sponsored by Women Poets at Barnard will begin on
Thursday, April 8 with a poetry reading, and continue through Saturday,
April 10. The keynote speaker will be Marjorie Perloff.  The conference
will feature critical papers as well as additional poetry readings.  Papers
received by January 5 will receive priority, but papers will be read
through January.  Papers grouped as panels welcome.  Please submit to
either Claudia Rankine, English Dept, Barnard College, 3009 Broadway, New
York, NY 10027 or Allison Cummings, English Dept, Hampden-Sydney College,
Hampden-Sydney, VA 23901.

Wow, thanks, Stephen, for your thoughts on "Thing Language," Spicer's
images, that great poem "When you break a line nothing/ Becomes better ..."
(!) etc. I think all the readings you suggest are legitimate, & probably
realized & considered by Spicer himself. I have only one question, which is,
okay, with respect to the idea that the ocean in this poem (the first poem
in _Language_) figures "as an image of formlessness or chaos" ... it feels
like that, but okay, even more, to me: I think of Thales, & wonder if this
is water/liquid as primary in some way. There's that line (I didn't bring
_Language_ to work with me today) a little later in the book "My house is in
Aquarius" ... etc., etc.

Jonathan. I actually own a copy of that old 78. I bought it at a yard
sale at Whittaker Chambers' house in the 1966. Your info is generally
accurate--Adorno on piano, Horkheimer on drums and Benjamin on clarinet.
Benjamin's playing is highly original though I hear Sidney Bechet's
influence. The quintet is rounded out by none other than Herbert Marcuse
on trumpet and a youthful Jurgen Habermas on base. Its a live gig, rare
for those days and takes place in the Hollywood Hills at the same house
in which Art Tatum made his famous recordings. The groups real name was
the School for Social Research Five but Adorno's playing was so far
ahead of its time that the producers of the recording, Fugitive Records,
changed the band's name. I disagree with your assessment of Adorno's
playing. He sounds like Lenny Tristano decades before the great west
coast pianist made the scene. This may account for the stiffness rap.
His rhythmic 'dialectic' with his drummer, Horkheimer, is inspired if
not 'enlightened'. The group disbanded shortly after this gig,
apparently for financial reasons, and this may explain some of Adorno's
bitterness toward jazz and the American listening public in
general.---Carlo Parcelli

Two questions about the forthcoming conference on Innovation and
Experimentation:

(1)  Are we now at the stage where Jorie Graham, Brenda Hillman, and Lucy
Brock-Broido are considered experimental writers?  What, overnight?

(2)  Why doesn't the title of the conference refer to women? Separatism
is not only the rule these days but also provides an opportunity for
writers who are only tangential to experimentation to be studied as what
they are not.

Jonathan, on my way to buy a new shoelace (having given up on used
shoelaces) last Tuesday I found three pretty beat-up 78s in The Final
Vinyl on the commons.

THe first was pretty cool: Lacan and the Frequent Polysyllables (with
Harry Belafonte), featuring their soul-chilling cover of "The Frankfurt
School Is Dead & Gone So Get Over It"  (originally written by Zoe Stope of
The Smalls).  But you'll be most interested to learn I ALSO ran across
"Adorno Adorno and the Frankfurt 5" and that it was in fact Merton on
bass.  TM actually wrote the second to last piece, "Addicted to the
Passe."  But you were right not to mention Adorno Adorno's foozled
performance in the aesthetically perfidious "My Thought is Dated as the
Glockenspiel," played on an outsized ocarina.  THe poor guy.  Anyway, the
78's worth about two bucks: you'd do better to just excise (sample) a few
of his two dollar phrases and sell them piecemeal.

Merton on base?! This is an obviously uninformed &/or fraudulant remark.
It reminds me of a statemant I overheard in my bookstore just yesterday.

To Eliz Treadwell and other interested parties:

The "Laura (Riding) Jackson and the Promise of Language" conference at
Cornell, on Oct. 8-9 was edifying, provocative, stimulating, enjoyable, and,
quite frankly, somewhat bizarre.  The scholarly panels were, I thought,
excellent, and the Cornell librarians had prepared fine displays, catalogues,
and talks for us visitors.  What struck me most keenly, however, was the sharp
divide between the scholars (who approached (Riding) Jackson's work with
ambivalent fascination, for the most part) and the members of the L(R)J estate
and inner circle, who approached her and her work with what Jeanne Heuving
described as "a posture of worship."  And so Alan Clark, from the estate,
spoke of "our Laura" as showing us "what it means to be a human being" and
apologized more than once for "falling down from the Laura level" by quoting
such as Whitehead, or for speaking as himself.  He asked forgiveness for "all
this appreciativeness" and reported that he himself had not read any poetry
for over 25 years since LRJ had explained to him the great fault with that
genre.  Mark Jacobs claimed that LRJ was "the greatest poet of the 20th
century" who showed us "where all the others went wrong" and can only really
be considered alongside Shakespeare.  The introduction to Elizabeth
Friedmann's (the official biographer's) presentation mentioned that LRJ had
"planted a kiss" on EF, which had sealed their friendship.  Friedmann and the
other Laura-ites asserted over and again that LRJ's critics write "grotesque
parodies" of her, that she is "scorned and despised," that she, in Clark's
words, "attracts covert meanness" (which Bernstein contrasted to "overt
meanness").
The result of this split between scholarly and worshipful attention was a
fascinating discussion at the end of the conference about the way in which to
attract more attention to LRJ's work, a desire shared by everyone in
attendance.  Jeanne Heuving, Carla Billitieri, Charles Bernstein, Barrett
Watten and others were most eloquent in telling the board that they could not
expect universal reverence--that attention was, in fact, more likely based on
difference than on utter acceptance of her thinking.  Suggestions were made to
the board and to LRJ's publisher, Michael Braziller, on how to disseminate her
work more widely (Braziller claims that her collected poems--now out of
print--would sell 250 copies a year forever and ever, but no more), including
the idea of packaging her poetry and prose in a single reader, since the
poetry sells better than the prose.  (This last fact doubtless bothers the
board, which takes LRJ's renunciation of poetry so seriously that participants
in the conference were informed beforehand that any material published on
LRJ's work must include reference to that renunciation.)
A few other participants in the conference said that they've experienced this
split between skepticism and reverence before at conferences devoted to a
single author, but I must say this felt like a baptism (religious and by
fire!) for me.

Mayhew may not have picked up on the Habermas and Marcuse because there
is actually a limited release tribute out album floating around out
there, performed by the downtown NY crowd.  The album has the same title
as the original Frankfurt 5 release, but is popularly known among
Knitting Factory afficianadoes as "News for Adorno."   The album
features "deconstructed" performances  (though most agree that
deconstruction is a suspect & non-kosher term when applied to knitting
factory jazz) of the original Horkheimer and Adorno scores.  The album's
uniqueness comes from producers Zorn and Gadamers decision to exclude
all trumpet and bass lines, and drums on all but three tracks.  Zorn
claims says the new instrumentation draws our attention to the
"surprising, often haunting lyrical" lines of Adorno and Benjermain.
"Everyone who has tried to copy these cats in the past has focused
exclusively on the grundwerk.  We wanted to do something different."

Purists find the new anti-foundationalist approach frustrating,  and
frankly, even I find it difficult to follow the twisted ironies at the
bottom of this american appropriation of a european appropriation of an
american idiom.  No one, however, thought of the album as anything other
than "mildly interesting," however, until Jurgen "Hand Lotion" Habermas
published a letter revealing how enraged the album made him.  He took
the recording as a direct snub to Marcuse and his contributions.
"Everyone agreed  I was the key.  Bass was the basis.  That's what they
used to say.  Now. . . what is this?  How can people dance to it if it
hasn't got a beat?"   Bringing up the bad blood between himself and
Gadamer (Gadamer's absconding with his fiancee in the Paris concert of
72, "and about a half pound of hash besides"), Jergen raised quite a
stir.  To this day, however, Zorn still suggests that the conflicts were
blown way out of proportion.   "They really have always had a deep
appreciation for each others work, in spite of everything."  Zorn was
upset by Jergen's letter, because he never intended to upset Jergan. "I
was a great fan of Old Lotion," Zorn admitts.  "He was one of my idols
when I was young."  Zorn hopes that the album, even with its limited
release, has helped to draw some new attention and fans to the original
music of F5, "including Jergen and Marcuse of course."

(Rumor also has it that Zorn later made a concillatory gesture to Jergen
by offering him the bass spot for a new project:  the
punk-hip-hop-klzermer revial band BLOODSUCKER".  The band was to feature
Bay Area turn table wizard Avitall Ronnell and screaming trance lyricist
Diamanda Galas.  To date, however, I have heard nothing on Jergen's
reply or what happened to this project.)

I've been in & out of town enough in the last month to have missed
responding to the early stages of this thread. I'm a little hesitant to
enter into a "discussion" that seems to be rapidly descending to the level
of ad hominem attacks, but I have a few things to say that might clarify
Adorno's position on jazz.

Adorno's critique of jazz has several roots.  It's now relatively easy to
counter, or at least to call into question, his analyses of popular culture
having little or no political efficacy.   (&, while it's easy to come up
with these counter arguments, it's hard to imagine that they'd sway Adorno
very far from his stance.)  But that's just a part of Adorno's problem with
jazz.  The critique that's far more difficult to deal with has to do with
the kind of musical complexity that was useful & important to him.

There've been one or two folks who said things along the lines of "If
Adorno had heard Charlie Parker or John Coltrane or Cecil Taylor (or
whoever), he would have thought differently about jazz."  This is basically
wishful thinking that can be easily dismissed by looking at Adorno's
overall analysis of classical music.

His sense of what's important there is based on a historical model of
harmonic complexity increasing until it's finally replaced by Schoenberg's
twelve-tone system, a functionally aharmonic method of organizing pitches.
While bebop is more complex harmonically than most pre-WWII jazz, in terms
of classical music history, this increase in complexity is roughly
equivalent to a move from Mozart's harmonic world to say, Brahms' or maybe
Wagner's.  In other words, it's still far below the radar of what Adorno
found interesting.

As to the later avant garde jazz, there are similar problems.  With the
exception of a few third stream pieces, very little of this music
approaches what he was interested in, much of this work is harmonically
modal as that term is used in jazz.  Rhythmic complexity didn't interest
Adorno, timbral innovations (funny noises) didn't interest him.  Virtually
every defining characteristic of modernist and avant garde jazz was
entirely irrelevant to Adorno's understanding of what was progressive in
music.

Adorno was a hardliner on this, music was his own primary artform, and no
amount of fudging on what he might of thought of various artists he may or
may not have ever heard, can alter where he drew the line on this aesthetic
issue.  If you have a problem with it, you just have to consider it an
irreconciliable difference.  Surely you all know people with whom you share
intellectual interests but with whom you have aesthetic differences (and
vice versa), right?

Bests,

Herb Levy's post on this issue is thoughtful and should be commended for
the light it sheds on this issue; I do wonder about phrases like "below
his radar" and "funny noises" and "his primary art form."  I guess if it's
put into terms of "what's interesting to him" you have to leave the issue
alone. HE's not into rhythmic complexity, improvisation, etc...

But the issue, for me, is not that he didn't find jazz progressive or
compelling (who cares if he did?) but the high-handed arrogance of his
critique, its aprioritism and dogmatism. I might have friends who disagree
with me, but I try to avoid condemning things I don't understand and
expect the same of my friends if they are to remain such.

I enjoyed Susan's post about "Lauralotry" in the Riding (Jackson)
conference.  Reminds me of a song I could hum for you in another medium
"Laura / but she's only a dream" etc...

Actually, this reminds me a little of the problem of dealing with Pound
and his much graver 'sin' of anti-semitism which, of course, transcends
questions of mere taste or cultural exegesis. Do you throw the Canto's
out because of their and his ugly association?
Adorno was not a bigot. That Adorno would not be moved on the jazz
'score', even if you supplied jazz pieces that fit Herb's/Adorno's
theoretical criteria, Adorno would never have altered his postion.  I
covered all of this in earlier posts. And as I stated in my earlier
posts, I'm willing to accept Adorno at face value and I find continuing
value in much that he has done.---Carlo Parcelli

Quite true and, as one would expect from "our" Marjorie, quite well done:
there are a number of glancing blows to the poetry but in the main the
attack is directed at the post-poetry L(R)J and her desire for a language of
one to one relations...

This issue of Parnassus also includes a grumpy assessment by Ross Feld of
the various vices and minor, in his opinion, virtues of Perloff's
Wittgenstein's Ladder...  In the same essay Feld beats up pretty hard on
Rothenberg's Poems For The Millennium but saves his roundhouse punches for
Bernstein's A Poetics.  Reading it over rather quickly it appears to be the
same old same old and I can't imagine any minds being changed on one side or
the other:  Feld shows he is reasonably well read, can come up with an
interesting reference/quote when the need arises and knows how to make sure
this issue of Parnassus is the required twelve pages longer than it would
have been without him.

susan has the scoop on the recent l(r)j conference.  that split
between Board Members and academics-who-sometimes-write-on-laura
reminded me of how the charismatic christians i used to know felt when
they were in a group of savvy non-believers.  pained and baffled.  it
would have been more touching if The Board wasn't in charge of estate
materials.
  like susan, this was my first single-author conference experience,
though i've heard of them in the past.  but since the Board was feeling
all the overboard commitment to laura, it made everyone else, i think,
able to be pretty skeptical about any author's claims to interpretive
priority over their work as well as to claims of non-comparability.
and as susan said, amidst this strangeness there were good papers:
steven meyer on stein-riding correspondence, susan's own challenge to
charles b's anti-introduction/response to =rational meaing=, barry
watten's readings of riding's negativities, carla billiteri's pointing
out riding's "controlled dialogue" in =progress of stories=.  and more.
  it was the kind of gathering that made me think of why people say the
things they say about authors and their works, the metaphors they find
to explain them, the matters they find key.  that made it interesting.

   Susan has A scoop on the l(r)j conference, as does Lisa, and as
   do "I" (for my part I have too many scoops to go into anykind of
   'review' here---I had a lot of great conversations, met alot of
   interesting people, many of whom were not necessarily of either
   of the camps of which l and s speak, and was more intellectually
   stimulated than i had been in some time...)
   I may be taken as an apologist for the "other" (board member) camp
   (though i enjoyed lisa, carla b's, etc. papers,
    and the way barry watten pronounced "the great much")
   but if i may claim interpretive priority concerning my own "stance"
   i do not think such is the case, even if i argue that
   i don't think i'm any more (to quote lisa s.) "skeptical about any
   author's claims of interpretive priority over their work as well
   as to claims of non-comparability" than i am of writers who claim
   to absolutely deny such claims, and be professed champions of
   the aleatory. As for non-comparability, I guess I think of Bloom's
   statement that instead of Freudian readings of Shakespeare there
   should be Shakespearean readings of Freud, and if I were to apply
   that comment to the question of L(R)J, I would perhaps "occupy"
   a "position" (or a reading of riding's "intent"--which is not
   absolutely singular, though it seems to be at times) that would
   allow for comparability, or at least comparisons with other writers,
   but instead of say Watten's Zizekian reading of Riding one would
   have a Ridingian (oh no, I'm "ding donging") reading of Zizek,
   for instance. I think Riding was far more critical of those who
   SUBORDINATED poetry to theoretical grids than those who would
   compare her thought and writing to others. She herself compares
   her thought to others, if all comparison is also contrast, whether
   explicit or not. --------cs

In response to Chris:  quite true, I did write a pretty negative piece
on LR for PARNASSUS; the response on the List shows me that this is not
a mag people on this list read, which may be just as well given the Ross
Feld piece and some other nasties in this issue.  I took the opportunity
because Herb Leibowitz, the editor, asked me to think about Riding and I
never really had.  I spent a lot of time on the work and must say I am
totally mystified as to what anyone sees in her.  I hate feeling that
way, given that some of my very favorite poets and critics--including
Charles Bernstein, Jerry McGann, and Susan Schultz admire LR but they
haven't (at least in print) made me see it.  I can't stand her abstract
stilted language; more important: I have a really hard time with her
ideas and her poetics!  I can see that she is a phenomenon, but....

So to me the whole idea of a Riding conference sounds bizarre--but it
may be my blindness.  Charles B makes a valiant case for her in the
Intro to her RATIONAL MEANING.

being substratic in Thales's sense. If we were to speak of pre-Socratics,
I'd mention Anaximinder and his "apeiron" as more along Spicer's lines, as
Thales's water is that out of which everything is constituted, whereas
"apeiron" is that from which everything comes, but from which it is also
(importantly) distinct. I'm really speculating here, though, and would
wonder if Spicer ever makes mention as Duncan, for instance, does) of
pre-Socraticism in any such manner, or for that matter of the
Babylonian/Egyptian roots of, what, 'aquamorphism'?

Actually, however, I wonder also what might happen in a reading of Spicer
that deals with ocean and radio as sympathetic tropes (radio signal as that
which is cast forth, like seaweed, from out of nowhere a la Cocteau). There
seems a sense of ocean as primal static, a sort of undifferentiated
semantic noise from which language (_Language_) is formed. I suppose if the
static is conceived of as _accompanying_ the messages, then it does become
substratic...?

Thanks for this Herb.  It sets the terms a lot more clearly than my piqued
responses.  I'd simply add two things: 1) Ornette Coleman has a very
sophisticated approach to improvised music which involves "a functionally
aharmonic method of organizing pitches." You're right to say that Adorno
wouldn't have given a shit but plenty of Schoenberg-inspired classical
musicians and composers *did* give a shit and that suggests that Adorno's
appreciation wasn't a mere impossibility.  2) To say "Rhythmic complexity
didn't interest Adorno" is to suugest that we can remain somehow in the
world of Adorno's purely aesthetic predilections, which of course we
can't; certainly Adorno would never have let us get away w/ such claims to
purely aesthetic, which is to say apolitical, motives.  And while he
wasn't a bigot per se, can such a west-centric philosophy/aesthetic
completely avoid the charge of bigotry?  I think that's worth considering.

No -- pica IS a measurement of space, and a constant one. But a pica is far
wider than word-spacing in 12-point type.

Why won't "wordspace" do just fine?

Susan, Thank you for the report!!

How and where does Laura (R) J denounce poetry? Anyone have an exact quote?

Has anyone read The Word Woman?? I think its compelling and important.

And does this have to do w/ Perloff's blows to L(R)J's "search for a one on
one correspondance"?

I find L(R)J's critique of R. Graves' The White Goddess quite INTERESTIN'.

Duane-- could you quote the glancing blow M. Perloff gibes to the poetry of
L(R)J?


Is the publisher under constraint of the Estate not to publish the poetry?
250 cc per year seems great, right?

Your right Michael. Adorno's position vis a vis jazz was Euro-centric.
But even admirers and sympathizers such as Stravinsky, Bartok,
Hindemith, Varese and Berio remain Eurocentric in their compositions. If
someone claimed to have shaken that in the course of say one lifetime
you could suspect them of being a phony. Read Adorno on Odysseus and the
Sirens in Dialectic of Enlightenment and you'll get the full flavor of
A.'s sympathy for the working man. But Adorno was, first, an
intellectual and his critiques do not rise to empathy. Still people like
me appreciaite his insights for what they are: non ego-centric attempts
to address unjust conditions. Adorno's method was complex and for me, as
a resolute modernist, this suggests a rigor that carefully investigates
each statement that he works into his critical edifice.
As for the real danger of Euro-centrism; every Columbus Day my wife the
infamous R.[osalie] Gancie toys with putting a sign in the window of our
store that reads: "Just because it's Columbus Day, don't take anything
that doesn't belong to you."
That's the Euro-centrism that Adorno struggled against. That Adorno
couldn't see jazz as part of that struggle---well. Maybe, we should beat
up on that timid mediocrity Philip Larkin for a while; poetry's owm Rudi
Blesh.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I found Douglas Oliver's thoughts quite interesting, but also somewhat
confusing.  He speaks of line breaks as though they could be "sensed"
during a performance.  But if you believe that poetry is a sonic art form,
then line breaks (and hence, lines themselves) are just a notational
convenience, meant to clarify, visually, the rhythm of the work.  You might
hear the rhymes and guess that that is where the breaks fall, but that
would just mean you're familiar with printers' conventions.  Might not a
given poem be lineated (that is, printed) in different ways, to call
attention to different aspects of the rhythm?  But such differences should
not affect the sound of the poem when read aloud, or at least, not very
much.

In general, I don't see how _variations_ in "performance" can be very
useful guides when describing a poem's rhythm.  They may help to reveal how
different people articulate sounds, or their assumptions about poetic
recitation, but do they really say anything about the poem in itself?  And
are actual variations all that great, even though machines may detect them?
There will always be differences in performance--how could there not be?
I think the idea of a "neutral music" diverts attention from the patterns
of sound inhering in a poem--which I find difficult enough to understand.

All HL meant by saying that music was TA's "primary artform" is, that TA
was trained as a musician and composer....Which he was.  Nothing more
sinister than that, i think, is intended by the phrase.

This is cute but does it have any historical accuracy whatsoever?  As
regards the American avant-garde, was Stein or Williams or Olson or O'Hara
or for that matter Rauschenberg, Pollock, Warhol, Cage, MacLow, a
"would-be academic" - this just seems to me to be a lie that
traditionalists like to tell themselves, for comfort's sake.  -m.

A group of faculty members here at Highland Community College (in
Freeport, Illinois) is interested in having our school add "sexual
preference" to its non-discrimination statement and we wish to
organize a campaign (it will take such to succeed in these
conservative environs) toward that end.

It would be helpful for us to know the names of some colleges that
have full and unqualified non-discrimination policies. Anyone out
there have any experience with a similar campaign?

Posts to the list on this or backchannel would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Few people were as hardline as Adorno on the issue of serial music, but I
see your point.  (Though I hear Coleman's Harmolodics more as a powerful &
beautiful, re-interpretation of harmony as a system rather than a denial of
it.)

I used this phrase to reinforce Adorno's notion of the primacy of
twelve-tone music as a progressive force both politically & aesthetically
(I can't see Adorno separating the two either).

I'd use the term elitist, rather than bigot, but maybe that's just me.

I don't care if you agree with him or not (& I don't), but I think to
reduce the problems with Adorno's complex, nearly apocalyptic vision of how
to fix what's wrong with contemporary culture to whether he's being
considerate of the opinions of others is, at best, an odd reading of
Adorno, given his overall project.

Adorno was was an elitist, he was a fanatic, & he was trying to save the
world.  Taste is exactly not the issue for him, he didn't care what music
you liked.  Adorno knew that ANY music rooted in harmonic structures was
evil (regardless of any potentially mitigating social, political, economic,
or aesthetic issues about the music), just another step along the path of
the repressive culture industry to totalitarianism.  He'd seen it happen in
Europe once, he desperately wanted to stop it from happening ever again.

It's not that he wasn't distinguishing clearly enough between sappy,
mechanical pop music, and beautiful, self-expressive jazz.  The problem for
him was that they were functionally the same - another nail in
civilization's coffin.  In his later essay on jazz, he calls bebop
something like "good bad music" - he knew it was "better" than earlier
jazz, but he knew equally well that it hadn't transcended its reactionary
stylistic flaws, it was still harmonically organized, functionally tonal
music. & no matter how big or "advanced" the chords were, no matter how
complex the music over the modal drone was, no matter how dissonant it was,
it still wasn't twelve-tone music and so was just as bad, in an absolute
moral sense, as well as a political & aesthetic sense, as the Andrews
Sisters.

From his point of view, Adorno wasn't talking about something he didn't
understand.  He KNEW the progressive value of serial music & he KNEW the
totalitarian nature of music with roots in traditional harmonic structures.
He knew that anyone buying into the wrong kind of art, the wrong kind of
culture, became a pawn of the regressive bourgeois culture industry.  He
didn't care about insulting your taste, from his point of view what you
think of as "your" taste is more often than not simply a symptom of a
repressive political/economic/social structure that must be stopped at all
costs.    He has no room for cultural relativism or being a nice guy - he's
trying to save the world through atonal music.  Basing "your" taste on what
you like rather than what will save the world is just one more small step
toward cultural suicide.


Look, there's no denying that Adorno was at best unenlightened about all
this, but he was trained as a composer of classical music in Europe before
WWII.  Folks with intense classical training often live in a musical
bubble.  I've heard some classically trained musicians complain about
classical Indian musicians not playing in tune, when that music is based on
probably the most complex system of tuning in the world. Many folks with
strict classical training (even to this day) have little or no
understanding about how jazz works.  (Which is why almost every "classical"
work "inspired" by "jazz" is musically clueless, but perhaps that's a
secondary issue here).  Combining this deep-rooted attitude with a tendency
toward Stalinism & you get a complex picture that's not so pretty.

Is Adorno music's Ezra Pound?  I'm not sure I'd go that far, but Adorno had
more than a few crazy ideas.



As to books from which to get at Adorno's ideas on music, I found Ben
Watson's Negative Dialectic of Poodle Play to be deeply flawed by the
author's fawning refusal to consider that everything Frank Zappa
did/said/thought might not be absolutely brilliant.

Probably more difficult for folks with little music background, but more
focused on Adorno's concepts (& far less gonzo), are Robert Witkin's Adorno
on Music (Routledge) & M Paddison's Adorno's Aesthetic of Music (Cambridge
U Press).

For other pop culture related uses of Frankfurt aesthetics, Dick Hebdige's
book on punk, Subculture: the Meaning of Style, is absolutely great & Simon
Frith (Fred Frith's brother) has a book that's very good, but I'll need to
check the reference on that.  But these two draw little from Adorno, & more
from the other Frankfurters.

I don't think that's what Doug's talking about. If I read him rightly, it's
like when I read one of my poems to an audience or any poem that I've read
before in private or also aloud to others the text on the page acts as
score, and I'm very clear as to what it says the music is and have this
firmly in mind, even when my performance of it varys from strict
reproduction. I react to, dance with, bounce off of, the score. The poem on
the page is the beat, say, but the rhythm, which varies, is the reading.
This is precisely what happens in the performance of music, what makes it
so exciting, why I go to many performances and have several recordings of
some pieces.

Another way to put this: the poem on the page doesn't, can't, notate the
full range of possible soundings because written language as notation has
its limitations. What the poem does is circumscribe those possibles--define
a set of possibilities more limited than "the sound of language per se."
That still leaves a lot to the choice of the moment.

But isn't that what writing is.  Doesn't writing notate the "ground bass"
of what language is : a codification of sound.  That's what I meant by
the "sound of language per se". So when Doug O. hears the "neutral music"
of the score he is hearing the "code" itself beneath the variations of
performance.

Even while living in a hermitage, Merton ran with a fairly diverse crowd
of poets, as the contributors indicate (not to mention his letters -- I
read his letters w/ Milosz not long ago, and while there's not as much
about poetry in there as one might expect, they're still interesting).
I've seen MP in several good libraries, plus, since my wife teaches at a
decent benedictine college, I've even read a couple of the non-facsimiles.
But it was an incredibly diverse magazine, while it lasted. Who knows what
it would have looked like had Merton not died when he did, had he been
able to continue it into the 70s at least.

You are making it worse, not better, for Adorno, Herb.  He KNEW that
harmonic music was evil?  That atonal music was the salvation of mankind?
Give me a break. If what you say is true, then he was simply a musical
fascist.  I'd like to give him more credit than that...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is a REVISED current (October, 1998) version of the EPC Author Page Call
for contributions:
=============================================
We are asking people to consider contributing to the EPC author page
development initiative. We feel there are certain key authors who should
have a page at the EPC. Since you may also be working on/reading some
of these authors, helping to create their page might be a simple matter,
and might be a natural tie-in to ongoing research and/or writing projects.
What is an author page? Our basic aim is to create a place where
links to resources in various web locations by and about the author might be
gathered. (Additionally, if the author would agree to notify me of future
web publications of their work, that would also be helpful.) In addition, in
an EPC author page, we often seek to make available some new-to-the-web
textual and/or visual resources, items specific to the EPC. But this is not
necessarily required.
The basic components of an EPC author page are:
1. a photo of the author.
2. a cv/list of publications/bibliography and brief bio. (If you are able to
scan book covers for the bibliography or works pages, that would be good.)
3. the above-mentioned textual work (and the author's agreement to use their
work) i.e., one or more works by the author including if possible, poems or
a poem sequence, a prose work/essay, other various genres such as
interviews, manifestoes, etc., other statements. Keep in mind that some of
these items can also be reprints of out-of-print or small circulation works.
Excerpts from forthcoming books are quite desirable since it can often lead
to increased sales. Finally, any visual works by the author can add
tremendously to the page. significantly.
4. List of links of other works the author may already have on the Web or
for work about the author. Be sure to search for the author name through a
number of search engines. Also check likely sources (links to some related
resources are provided at the top of the EPC author page list of authors)
such as PMC, etc.
5. Works about the author. Some of these may result from the Web search in 4
above. In addition, you may wish to query the Poetics list for essays that
can be included, contact others who write on the author for materials, or
include a piece of your own critical work. It can be very valuable to have
at least a couple of works about the author when this is possible.
Please make sure you contact us before beginning work on an author
page as numerous pages are already in progress. Once you have created the
EPC author page, files can be sent as attachments to e-mail (include a list
of file names in e-mail message) or mailed on diskette. We can transfer the
files via FTP by special arrangement. A template for the author's home page
is available at
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/template
Name the main author page index.html and design the page so that files are
reference with relative links and reside in a single directory.
An EPC author page does not require *extensive* knowledge of HTML.
Indeed, the core activity of such a page is to research, gather and compile
materials related to a given author; often this allows you the opportunity
to contact and work with someone in whose work you are interested. It is
also a

valuable form of advocacy for writers who you believe should be read more
widely.
The main purpose here is to develop a center where people might find
out more about these authors. Help us with this collective effort to develop
a body of content related to poetry that is available on the Web.
A list of suggested authors whose pages currently need to be created or
developed follow. Have a look and let us know if you are interested or if
you have suggestions.
For further details, please contact: Loss Glazier,
glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu
or Charles Bernstein (bernstei@bway.net) regarding this initiative.

I'm not sure that I get your drift--we may be like those ships at night. If
you had said "the sound of the language of the poem as written" I would be
sure that we agreed. The language of the poem is an idiosyncratic subset of
the language as a whole, and its music, both notated and improvised, is a
subset of the possible musics of the language.

Try looking in context. Music and music criticism had been a _political_
battleground since Beethoven. Notable revolutionary warriors included
Schumann, Wagner, Mahler and the serialist trio. Riots at concerts were not
unusual, and there were pitched battles in the streets and the journals
between adherents of different schools of musical thought. By Adorno's time
romantic tonality was seen by leftist intellectuals as an anachronistic
bourgeois comfort/validator and as such an impediment to revolution. This
was not about taste, it was about the future of mankind. That the thinking
is reductive is hardly surprising.
Few of us take art that seriously any more.

dear chris,
  i appreciate what you write here, and your (and riding's) claims for
poetry (or say 'creative writing') as a literature of knowledge
resonate.  this is in part what i understood your conference talk to be
about.  i found the whole thing stimulating as well, but again strangely
bifurcated for me because i felt a human sympathy with the Board
members, who are clearly walking around bereft, with the roving wound of
absent laura within them.
  as for riding's refusal of comparisons -- well, that refusal
intensified, of course, from what i know of her work.  which doesn't
really have anything to do with why i prefer the earlier period of her
work to the later one.

All I'm asking is, is what this Dawn Powell person said about the
avant-garde *true in any way* or is it just the fantasy of "real"
academics and non-academics alike that the avant-garde is composed of
"would-be academics."  So, yeah, it sure as hell does matter whether it's

With the exception of Powell's "usually" I would say of course it's quite
true -- it's both historical and hysterical.  Seems to me the whole point
of the "avant-garde" is that it's "would-be" everything: it's meant to be
neither here nor there, while still in a very interesting "somewhere."
The academy's been a refuge for many a duck-headed crow.  I took
FeldPowell to say that 'avant-garde academic' (1) can be oxymoronic and
(2) can make a travesty of both the duck and the crow.  You might get a guy
writing "essays" stuffed with 80s jargon and slinging brackets and dashes
like nunchucks.  Give me a Vachel Lindsay with his buffo and his Lysol any
day of the week.  Give me a Arensberg with his up-dada's down-dada's.
Give me again the Baroness, please, with her shellacked head and dainty
hands. The same hands that clocked WCW.

Tell me if _this_ is historically accurate:

*: Didn't "avant-garde" -- once upon a tingle -- mean "a bit of fun"?

[[my pt with the immediate above is that it's too often too hard to have
fun while being respectable.]]

Hi, Stephen,

Again, thank you for your thoughts & readings. Okay, as far as

> that deals with ocean and radio as sympathetic tropes (radio

in "Transformations," we get

                  ... Those
Swans we saw in the garden coming out of
      the water we hated them.   "Out of place,"
      you said in passing.   Those swans and
      I (a blink in context), all out of place
      we hated you.

So, what's happening here? For one thing, a reversal takes place, the "we"
in the beginning of this hanging-indent stanza isn't the same "we" by the
end of it. The first we "hated them"--the swans--the second we includes the
swans. The I becomes a pivot. And, at the word "passing," we do pass, from
one "we" to the next. But, now, Stephen, how does what you say above work
with this image of swans coming out of water & hatred attached to them. Some
judgment against them. And, also, judgment on the part of the swans against
the others. The first hatred because the swans are seen as "out of place."
The second hatred (the swans' hatred) as consequence of being "all out of
place." Except, of course, this is Spicer, and when we read "Those swans
and/ I (a blink in context), all out of place/ we hated you" it's another
one of these great Hericlitean hinge-phrases, where, depending on the kind
of emphasis you put & where you put it, the whole meaning changes. So that
we can include I and be separate from I. In other words, in the final "we
hated you," "we" might be "I and the swans" or "I and the 'you' in the
second sentence."

Okay, so, I'm not sure if this is what you mean when you say substratic, how
the language crystalizes, and then, as you begin to really study it, breaks
back down into formless liquid. But, we do get the swans coming out of the
water (as far as an image in the poem), and then, more significantly, what
happens as we read this thing, I mean, it's a great effect, and of course we
end with "We/ Hated them." which is kinda funny since by this time "we" and
"them" are everyone involved. And this comes right after the phrase "the
last/ swan back in place." So, to be "in place," okay, what does that mean
for Spicer? Or for his pronouns? Does it mean liquid? Formlessness?
Pre-crystallization?

someplace in P. Burger's "Theory of the Avant-Garde" he refers to a
Breton piece of writing (manifEsto?) redefining art as a category of "fun".

Is it that avant-gardes are would-be academics or academics are
would-be avant-gardes? This is an important question which should have
been settled decades ago, and why it hasn't is also an important question,
which, while we are on the subject, ALSO should have been settled -
decades ago. Decades ago?  Decades a go-go.

There's the avant-garde, and then there's the historical avant-garde.
The historical avant-garde was the truly hysterical avant-garde, while
the other avant-garde is truly an other-garde, that is, other than avant-.
We are the other, as Rimbaud was, and avant for avant's sake = art for
art's sake, which is retrogade for retrograde's sake, and therefore
A does not = A, which is quite other, and therefore avant, if not historical.

Now to disrupt the traditionalist paradigm of the arts on behalf of a new
and liberated society and personal lifestyle is one of the hallmarks of
the Hallmark Avant-Garde, which is, of course, other than the traditionalist
paradigm, which is to liberate oneself from Hallmarks of every kind by means
of a traditional archasmic lifestyle.  The archasmic lifestyle, first
set in motion by Arthur Rimdude and brought to a complete stop by has half-
brother Arthur Rimbaud, is in essence and by definition that which is
unrepeatable in any form, a good Benjaminite definition of traditional
art, which is, of course, the essence of the dada whatsit and the
surrealist thingum.  Down with bourgeois concrete!  Down with bourgeois
wood!  Down with bourgeois plastic!  Down with "bourgeois" - too hard to spell!
Down with aristocracy!  Down with money!  Down with "down" - too easy to spell!
Down, boy!

^How and where does Laura (R) J denounce poetry? Anyone have an exact
quote?

Chelsea, issue 20/21 its a long quote, or see The Telling, Anthelone
Press 1972 also throughout Chelsea 35 such as

"When I put away my implements of poetry, I felt for the first time the
full difficulty of the linguisitic task of truth. The difference between
words as real words, words of a real language, and the imitation-words
that crowd the mind I saw to be a far greater one than it had appearedto
be under the auspices of my faith in poetry as capable of embodying the
very spirit of language." (p69)

I have not seen the article referred to, but I would assume Perloff's
blows to L(R)J's "search for a one on one correspondance" are about her
poetry. I can't imagine how these blows would be any harsher than the
shortcomings L(R)J wrote about her own poems and fallacy of poetry in
the prose articles and books which followed her renunciation of poetry.
The lie of poetry is to cheat the reader as little as possible for the
truth which is gained through the use of illusion to create a
non-existent stability referrent which points towards the illusion
presenting the lie in truth's guise. A well intentioned wolf in sheep's
clothing still is.

Also, just wanted to say, here, you're absolutely right. My friends with no

My sense when I am writing or reading poetry is that there is an
internal rhythm that I responding to (trying to anyway) rather than a
score out there on the page?

"orientation" as in daniel zimmerman's language is the key word. If you
go with "preference" you are open to debates about protecting a
voluntary status. You will hear this debate anyway, but if you go with
"orientation" some of the natural law conservatives will be outflanked.
I believe American Psychological Association policy statements on
homosexuality are also clued to "orientation" rather than "preference."
The debate will center on whether or not homosexuality is a preference
anyway--don't start by conceding this point.

Well said, Weiss.  Which is precisely Henry's point.

I only meant that you might get a guy writing "essays" stuffed with 80s
jargon and slinging brackets and dashes like nunchucks -- while being
simultaneously incoherent AND respectable.  This is, I think, the "stuffed
shirt" situation recently priggishly decried by a heartfeldt Feld -- a
situation entirely WORSE than being either simply respectable or
incoherent.

When I say Give me a Vachel Lindsay with his buffo and his Lysol, I am
referring to the poor man's suicide by quaffing Lysol while being more
than half despondent that his experiments were ultimately laughed at.

When I say Give me a (can't bring myself to write "an") Arensberg with his
and his up-dada's down-dada's, I'm referring to the aforementioned lack of
a highly serious and stunningly boring theoretical apparatus during the
days of dadaetc.  The one unbearable thing about High Modernism was its
High Seriousness. The one unbearable thing about the recent Avant Bored is
their attachment to a High Seriousness.

Such stubborn seriousness is perpetuated in most cases by a virulent
refusal to recognize that one is being utterly boring.  And utterly
cliche.

Cliche?  That Saussure's theory of language is linguistically useful is
entirely beside the point.  The point is it's boring.  B=O=R=I=N=G

Now, as for "stuffed shirts":

When I say Give me again the Baroness, please, with her shellacked head and
dainty hands, I am being perfectly obvious.

These were the same hands that clocked WCW. The Baroness was one of the
few who made The Little Review not just a good read but a Great Read. She
was a nut: Margaret Anderson decried the obscurantism of the later Little
Review and this was one of the reasons Anderson left the LR: The Baroness
was not obscure.  She was simply incomprehensible.  There is a difference.

One is not allowed be incomprehensible in academia.  One is only allowed
be obscure.  This is a problem only insofar as incomprehensibility is not
boring, whereas obscurantism is.

The great Patrick Kavanagh (who certainly wouldn't qualify as "avant
garde" but who nevertheless dragged Irish poetry from romanticism)
insisted that you could tell a poet easily enough: a poet is not boring.
I'd have to say that by this criterion a great many of today's avant-garde
poets -- most especially those with heavy theoretical affiliations -- are
not poets.

As for the "stuffed shirt" syndrome as witnessed on a list ostensibly
about avant-garde poetics, I do say that one begins to get the sense that
discussing the relevance or irrelevance of Wittgenstein, Adorno, Zizek,
etc, will not lead to that BRISANCE one so often wishes for -- and
which the avant-garde has so often historically provided.

We should all write like Jimmy Durante's face.

Very Warmly, Gaga

Stephen, I'm sorry to keep like cyberharassing you or whatever, but your
input has been really helpful to me. And, I'm not convinced that Spicer
doesn't reference the pre-Socratics. That pun in _Language_ on Arrows/Eros,
when Kennedy is shot in the back! that seems like a playful rewriting of the
Heraclitus fragment about "bios." I mean, it's the same kind of pun & the
essential irony is the same, resolves itself similarly. I read that & I'm
struck! (Pun intended.) The ghosts of the pre-Socractics are here.

Anyway, I'm aware that reading like this, in some way goes against what I
get as far as a way of being attentive to (respectful toward?) the poem, as
hinted at in "Intermission I":

"The movement of the earth brings harmes and fears.
Men wonder what it is and what it meant."
      Donne
In the next line
Contrasts this with "the celestial movement
       of the spheres."   Rhyme soothes.    And
       in a book I read in college fifteen
       years ago it said that this was an
       attack on the Copernican theory and
       a spidery hand had pencilled in the margin
       "Earthquake."
Where is the poet?  A-keeping the sheep
A-keeping the celestial movement of the
       spheres in a long, boring procession
A-center of gravity
A-(while the earthquakes of happiness
       go on inside and outside his body
       and the stars in their courses stop
       to notice)
Sleep.

But, still (& more on this poem in a bit). Going back to Thales,
Anaximander, & Heraclitus, these ideas of principle & elemental: Let's say
that, in that previous Spicer poem quoted yesterday, "in place" maybe has
something to do with "law." Law or principle prior to even something so
seemingly formless or chaotic as "liquid" (or "fire," to insist on my own
pre-Socratic hero). & this I take (tell me if I'm totally confused) to be
what you mean by "aporia." Is "aporia" also "law"? I mean, is what happens
when something emerges from & becomes distinct from "aporia" an attendance
to law?

 What is "law" in that poem "Transformations"? I mean, because if something
has the capacity or tendency to transform, to be transformed, then its
nature is . . . what? I don't think it's quite so simple as "boundlessness,"
necessarily. Because, okay, because the poem takes (as does everything else
we can experience take) _specific shape_. And it is the capacity or nature
or tendency of things to _persist_. (". . . all things steered through all
things"--Heraclitus.) (or "It is wise, listening not to me but to the Law,
to acknowledge that all things are one"--Heraclitus.)

Bearing in mind the Heraclitus fragment about sleeping/waking, and read
again the poem quoted above. Spicer says the poet is "A- . . . Sleep." &
sleep seems to be that state in which we are when we are, as I read the
Heraclitus fragment, most individuated, most "specific." And the poem,
whatever else it might be, is a specific instance, and it doesn't really
matter wherefrom the signals, they've been filtered through the poet
(harelipped, cleft-palleted or otherwise).

So, while _Language_ does seem saturated with these tropes of "signals,"
I've read much blander poetry, much more airy poetry, and find, in
_Language_, a real attention to these, well, _details_, specific
_manifestations_ of signals. Now, I just read last night Kristin Prevallet's
"The Reluctant Pixie Poole," in which she says that Helen Adam was
"skeptical at [Spicer's] claims to understand magic . . . [was] a demon from
hell." Which is pretty brutal, and no doubt had more than a little personal
motivation behind the judgment. (Adam was, as Prevallet casts her, somewhat
slavishly attendant to Duncan, & was caught, no doubt against her will, in
between their fued.) And, frankly, I don't care whether or not Spicer was a
magician in any "real" sense. His value to me is as a poet. (Whatever value
a poet can have for a cartoonist.)

There are too many books & downloaded internet texts on my nighttable. Let
me shove them all aside for a moment & concentrate on the poems themselves.
Okay. That whole "Love Poems" series. Stephen, this is where I find what's
most usuable for myself. Is "love" the law governing those things
experienced as individuated beings? Because, wow, look how this section
begins:

Do the flowers change as I touch your skin?

This question, for me, is really essential. That you could ask such a thing.
Because, wow, what is Love? he seems to be asking. A kind of energy
(signal)? And as negative-sounding as what follows

They are merely buttercups.   No sign of
       death in them.   They die and you know
       by their death that it is no longer
       summer. . . .

 it's _not_ a refutation of such a thing or energy (or law?) as Love. If
Heraclitus sees death in life or life in death (bow = bios), Spicer sees
death in love or love in death (eros = arrows). So, okay, how about this: Is
Love . . .  Life? Are living things governed by the "law" of "Love"? And are
these distincions ("love," "life," "death") made merely because we have this
thing or capacity or filter called "language"?

Up way to early this morning,

Gary

The University of Maine, the whole state system, has such a policy, though
it uses the words "sex and sexual orientation." "Fully inclusive of the
diverse populations it serves," etc. Text must be on the Univ. website.
Good luck with the campaign. Sylvester

Subject:      try these experiments

1. Divide all your poetry into "practice work" and "poetry".  Keep all your
practice work at home - don't show it to anyone - make your will & designate
all the practice work for the posthumous recycling bin.

2. Establish extremely rigid, difficult & high standards for your poetry
for public consumption.  These should include: a) no poetry which you
could not recite without embarassment to ANYONE - from Czeslaw Milosz
to the families in line at the food pantry; b) no imitations: ie.
no vague strings that "sound like" Ashbery or pedantic excoriations
of the bad guys that quote obscure historical documents & "sound like"
Pound; c) nothing too boring to read to the most acidly clever wit you
know; d) nothing too classy to read before a high school audience from
the trailer park; e) no poems that start with "from"; f) no poems that
will not confuse, bore, and offend your own literary set.

3. Accept the fact that the poetics list is a substitute for reading and
writing poetry and "sign off" for at least 3 months.

4. Accept the fact that in a rich materialist consumer glut empire, the
concept of "anything goes" in art & poetry, the cult of over-production,
is one of the prime examples of conformity all along the literary
spectrum, from the fat & bloated "margins" to the complacent "mainstream".
As Errol Miller puts it (in his poem in Nedge #6) "here we have
hard-hitting poetry and soft judges".  Once you have accepted this
fact, search for a sustainable poetic economy.

5. Do the following over a period of six months, simultaneously:
1) volunteer at your local homeless shelter & devise an employment program
for laid-off workers & high school dropouts involving the production of
"people's bicycles"; 2) give away all your extra clothes; 3) learn
Spanish and Swedish; 4) stop using the word "aporia"; 5) ride the
rails; 6) work on no more than ONE poem.

6. When you return to your "literary" life, do the following simultaneously
(absolutely NO shirking): write an article about your "people's bike"
industry for your local paper; write an essay on a poet you thought
you weren't going to like & still aren't sure if you do; write a letter
to your Mom; work on no more than ONE poem per month in your private notebook.

- I guarantee if you fulfill these six simple experimental assignments
the literary atmosphere will clear & brighten considerably & all will
be well & all manner of thing will be well & the inflated & devalued
will be deflated & revalued. Amen.

- Henry Gould

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  Thanks to all the people who attended the
Laura Riding Jackson conference at Cornell for their reports, which really
made me feel as though I were there, it sounds like an amazing event from
any perspective.  I remember once writing a play in which a mad scientist,
yearning to return to the prelapsarian days when people had only one name,
devised a doomsday-type machine to destroy all humans with two names, but

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Andrew Rathbone and Mark Weiss have been making me think some more, and my
thanks for that.  But Henry Gould on code and neutral music raises complicated
questions, which Mark has ably addressed.  Pardon my opening simplicities
here:

1.   English has coded intonations at word level, such as: "breakfast" (US &
Brit English, most dialects) higher pitch on "break", which is stressed
because this is a double noun -- stress on first noun.  This is grammatical
(such codes were the basis of the dubious Chomsky-Halle attempt to codify
stress).

2.   English has other near-codes at phase level: "What are we having for
breakfast?"  Wh-question, nearly a code but passing fuzzily into pragmatics
because questions like speaker-certainty enter into it, affecting intonation.
Still, the phrase usually has a fairly constantly falling intonation in which
"break" is still higher pitch than "fast".  (Certain American dialects --
Buffalo included, I think -- may turn many sentences up at the end to give a
peculiar insistence to the speech in general.  Let's leave special dialects
apart.)

3.   If we don't hear the answer and check it with increased stress on "What",
"_What_ are you having ..."  or if we ask "Are we having breakfast?" (yes/no
question), the intonation will probably turn upwards at the end of the
sentence and "fast" may then have a higher pitch than "break", though "break"
will still carry main stress, via other qualities than pitch.

So in points 2 and 3 we have the beginning of a trading (pragmatics) between
real situation, attitudes, feelings on the one hand and code on the other,
though the usages are so habitual they are almost coded in.

4.   A line of really bad poetry, invented to illustrate:

       In the wild breakfast where's the withered cornflake?

Normally (my own neutral tune), I'd read this with a rising pitch on "fast".
If I gave "wild" and "where's" huge stress because I thought them very
important words, it would change all the note values because my interpretation
would have changed -- even the smallest change of interpretation makes some
difference to tune.  Then, I might read "fast" with slightly falling pitch.

5.   The notion of "code" cannot survive the minute nuances of interpretation
or the fact that the music you want to give a line as you perform it changes
as you pass along.  The only notion that makes sense to me is that at every
stage of the line when being read, the possibility of a neutral tune underlies
the changes that you make to its neutrality. It's a possibility only, an
evanescent thing made concrete, determined, slightly changed out of neutrality
by every sound you make.  Therefore, it cannot be coded in, as it is an
ephemera of the moment, yet in fact (since we're all human) may be broadly
similar to any good reader's "neutral tune" for that poem -- the differences
are often minute, as Andrew Rathbone implies.

Code is linguistic.  Intonation is sited uneasily between linguistic rule and
performance -- and, through its unease, allows in so much of poetry's
subtlety.

Wyatt writes sexistically:

So unwarely was never no man caught
With steadfast look upon a goodly face.

The pitch on "never" may change from "very high" to "high" to "mid" to "low"
according to whether you: a) read normally with some fairly neutral attention
to "unwarely" (high "never"); b) unusually stress "So" raising its pitch even
more (low pitch for "never"); c) stress "no" (mid-pitch for "never"); d) or
unusually stress "never" (very high pitch).  But different readers may not
follow what I've just said, because of cultural, dialect, or idiolect reasons.
Fair enough.  It remains that when readers do follow what I've just said, the
smallest differences in their interpretations are crystal clear to me because
the musical shape of the whole line, as now reinterpreted, falls into shape
for me.

What they have shown is their departure (for emphasis and stress) from a more
orthodox reading (as judged by myself and others), and are in the process of
establishing another suggested norm for their own reading.  But that norm
cannot be trapped -- it flies away even as we listen for it.  That's what the
"neutral tune" is; it cannot be regarded as a code because codes are
repeatable, whereas "neutral tunes" never are repeatable -- exactly, that is.
In fact, their ontological status is decidedly dicey!

I expect you all want me to be quiet now.


Doug

Nice. But suppose the third line read "and let the girls blow chunks in the
porcelain goddess." You get that half-rhyme gross/ goddess, which seems
meaningful all by itself, although you lose that nifty inversion.

Doug, maybe code was the wrong word to use.  I'm thinking of something more
basic & simple.  My question is: if you hear a neutral music or generic
quality beneath variations of performance - could it not be that you are
hearing what is truly universal & generic to language itself, no matter
what the language, what the dialect, etc.  You are hearing the rhythm of
syllables - the rhythm created when sound is broken into components &
reassembled.  - Henry G.

I have the same difficulties with Laura as Perloff does--the theory, the
poetry, the politics, the person-- I remain unconvinced of her importance,
though I am open to arguments in her favor.  She (Laura) seems to have
adopted the problematic "misunderstood genius"  mode associated with other
modernist poets, but the problem is she wasn't a genius. She would write
long involved letters complaining she had been misrepresented--often to
people who had dealt with her sympathetically!  It is precisely this sort
of "misunderstood" autodidact that inspires cultish devotion.

She is a strangely fascinating figure all the same; I've read interesting
articles *about* her but not as much of interest *by* her. One idea of
hers that did strike me years ago is the complaint that poetry is too much
a specialized concern of poets; that in some sense poetry (or the
linguistic values it ought to embody) is too important to leave to
specialized practioners.

If you want a theory of the correspondence between language and truth,
there's always Wittgenstein's Tractatus.  Or if you want a theory of how
poetry gets in the way of truth, read Plato. (Riding) Jackson has always
struck me as turgid and amateurish, though I could be wrong (as I usually
am.)

issue of CrossConnect, a premier online and print literary journal, is
due for release in a few days.  We still could use some good nonfiction
pieces to round out the mag.  If you have anything lying around, I'd love
to take a look at it, and show it to the ed-in-chief of the magazine,
David Deifer.  Some of you have already submitted and/or been published
in the magazine (Mike Magee is a contributing editor!), and I hope you
can help us now.

Thanks a lot.

if john cage said that then john cage has not seen the tv show "full house"
nor has he tested his blood/sugar level 4 times a day. these things are
boring, boring, boring. what's wrong with boring? granted, being bored is
not one of my favorite feelings but what the hell, boring happens. but then
when i think about it there is some tension wondering if bob sagat or
anyone else in the cast is going to deliver a line that is genuinely funny
or genuinely anything other than bad acting. but when that NEVER occurs the
tension disappears. and there is a certain tension wondering what the
blood/sugar level is going to be this time, but the poking a needle into
your finger 4 times a day part wears thin fast.

Jonathan--

With your post (as with a number of others) i'm not sure how much you are
talking about her *poetry*...

I haven't looked at in a while, but my interest in it goes back 18 years
or so...i suspect i still find much of it worth some attention; as i
recall, it can be weird, startling, wildly ludic, sharply odd and dryly
poignent.  Much more unexpected and exhilerating, at its best, than the
work of her sometime collaborator/lover, Graves.  Her play with the sound
level of the english tradition of nonsense doggeral can be fascinating.

Her work from after she saw the light and turning against poetry, seems to
me irrelevant and without interest. But not necessarily the poems.

Parenthetically [(())))}}] ...i haven't yet seen the Perloff piece;

mark p.

Dear Hannah

Would you be interested in a prose piece on a recent MoMa show called OBJECTS
OF DESIRE?  Since you are in Philadelphia, perhaps you have seen my reviews on
poetry and art in the Inquirer.  Last Sunday, for example, review of PORTRAITS
by the art critic Kimmelman.

At any rate, perhaps you know my work: a poet, fiction writer (just published
a book of short stories called THE RADIANT ABSURDITY OF DESIRE reviewed
beautifully in Publishers Weekly of l7 August) and literary and art critic.

Sincerely

Harriet Zinnes

The word is KERNING.

Kern \Kern\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Kerned; p. pr. & vb. n. Kerning. ] (Type
Founding) To form with a kern. See 2d Kern.

kerning

The process of reducing the spacing between certain pairs of letters to
improve their appearance.  When a font is created, each character is given
a width that includes some space around it so that the letters don't run
into each other when displayed or printed.  This can be thought of as an
invisible box around each character.  Some pairs of characters such as A
and V, look better if the boxes overlap slightly, bringing the characters
closer together (but still not          touching).

Source: Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) [web1913]

Kern \Kern\, n. (Type Founding)
A part of the face of a type which projects beyond the body, or shank.



Perhaps, we could look at lines breaks of a poem as the kerning of lines.
Is it really all for some display purpose?  I disagree with what was quoted
of Pinsky.  In that case, why doesn't he write prose?  Let's just string
all the lines together and write some prosaic doggerel?  God knows, his
poem in the NYRB is doggerel.

Lines, for me, are breaths.  Poetry imposes a slower reading than prose.
It takes a bit both physically and intellectually to read through a poem.
Where one can scan a page of prose, one cannot scan a page of poetry and
think that s/he will get a rich reading from the poem.

I'd like to announce the publication of  a special double issue
of _Quarry West_ devoted to the work of Ron Silliman:

RON SILLIMAN and the ALPHABET
"E-mail Interview with Ron Silliman" (Thomas C. Marshall and Thomas A. Vogler)
"Reading Ketjak" (Ron Silliman)
"'Nevermore' than: Form, Content and Gesture in _Ketjak_" (Thomas C. Marshall)
"Education, Equality and Ethnography in _The Alphabet_" (Hank Lazer)
"Public Poetry: Ron Silliman and the  Value of Writing" (Tyrus Miller)
"The Labor of Repetition" (Lytle Shaw)
"Wild Form" (Ron Silliman)
"Reading Silliman Writing" (Thomas A. Vogler)
"The Language Poet as Autobiographer" (Marjorie Perloff)
"A Possible Course: The Long Poem in the 20th Century" (Ron Silliman)
"_The Alphabet_: A Serial Poem: Sequence of publication"

I remember a thread on this list awhile back where many people expressed
approval of journal issues devoted to the work of a single author, so I
hope there will be interest in this attempt to make a critical and
interpretive assessment of Ron's work. Members of the list can obtain
copies postage free for $15.00 by writing to _Quarry West_, C/O Porter
College, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA  95064. Copies also
available through SPD.

Important to be precise. The Pinsky poem is not technically doggerel.
Dogbreath is closer.

sometimes, OK -- but have you heard Tom Raworth read? Or Miles Champion?
Not that most people would read their work, from the page, as fast as the
authors read it -- but it certainly wouldn't be wrong to do so. And I don't
know that, just because something is "poetry," it "imposes" anything at all
in terms of the reading.

Hey, I take your point, Billy: most work boring.  I wouldn't say 90% of
Whitman or Dickinson is, though a good bit, yes. (75% Whitman, 45%
Dickinson?)

My point however isn't about individual poets, but about schools or
movements: if there is a PATTERN to the "boringness," that's a problem.

It's curious to me that so often the more boring the poet/school, the
more theoretically inclined the poet/school is.

Call it Gaga's Law.  Call it BS.  Call it a hunch.

Man, if you're going to be boring then JUST DO IT: forget about telling
the literary world why you intend to continue to be boring.

dear jonathan, mark, et al,

   for me, the two best books of riding's are =progress of stories=
(1935) -- her principal, really her sole, collection of short stories --
and =anarchism is not enough= (1928), which i'm happy to say will be
reprinted by the univ. of california press by this coming summer (so my
editor tells me -- i wrote notes & intro for it).  the latter is quite
wonderful, in the vein of =guide to kulchur=, =content's dream=, and the
like.  both are wholly "prose."

  my favorites of her poems come and go rather than being concentrated
in a particular book (leaving aside the =collected=).  some work in
=love as love, death as death= (1928), and the outrageous blakean =the
life of the dead= (1933), some work in =though gently= (1930, a kind of
severe =spring and all= mix of prose and poetry), and in =poet: a lying
word=, are meaningful to me as efforts toward poetry as intellectual
beauty (stressing the first word) and/or a literature of embodied
knowledge.  hammering at words to break them open, structuring them to
build something, concreting abstractions.

  but i'll stand by the first-mentioned two prose works, any day.  not
to say they have no competition or context (eg calvino, wittgenstein,
bataille).  but that's not really to the point, since i presume we want
to multiply rather than divide the works we find worth reading about
ways of seeing.

 as for riding's later works, i do find touching some of the heartfelt
idealism of =the telling= (even as i find its totalizing unitarianism a
bit scary and certainly impossible); but i think =rational meaning= was
written by riding's spectre.  except when i pretend that it's poetry,
too.

   as for her intrepretive screws -- put to interpreters, that is -- i
figure 1/ she had some reasons to feel pissed off, but mostly 2/ she was
an intransigent, cranky absolutist who could be very not nice.  and
isn't it a pretty common trait of 'genius' -- a category i find not
terrifically useful, except perhaps in describing someone who has an
extremely limited one thing they master and obsess about -- to lack
common sense perspective?

  and finally, she didn't denounce so much as renounce poetry, as people
have pointed out in various articles.  but she did not repudiate her old
work.  she wanted the powers of poetry to be absorbed into what she came
to see as the genre-less universal language of english prose.

  i'll shut up now -- i just felt moved to respond to some of these
interesting remarks & queries about her work.

The controversy abt the correct term for the space between words is
perhaps the dullest in poetics list history, though maybe if we go on long
enough it will become interesting again, who knows?

Close 2nd is discussion of line/breaks. It seems pretty obvious: Pinsky is
wrong.  In enjambed free verse, you got to put in a pause of however small
duration (or mark the break somehow)  or why are you breaking the line
there? You don't have to breathe or drop the voice or count to ten.  Can
you imagine saying "as I sd to my (gulp for air) friend because I am
always (gulp for air) talking"? Creeley as asthmatic.

On the other hand, the fact that there is little agreement about any of
this means that the line break is not effective as a convention. I
remember a poetry reading by one Philip Levine, who told the audience he
split his lines in two when sending poems for the New Yorker, because they
paid by the line.

since charles.a. is the only nay-sayer, I will lend him support, between
words you have wordspace or word space, sorry no fancy term...for some
reason there is no need for one, in the movable type days was the space
slug just called a blank? (that's what I seem to remember but not
clearly)

...b/w letters you have a variety of terms: kerning (as in pair
kerning), character spacing (msword6.0), tracking, etc.

    It's good to see Lisa mention "Progress" and "Anarchism" AS WELL
    AS the poetry of the period (in contrast to, say, vendler).
    ... when I was considering writing my dissertation on Riding
    at SUNY-Albany and having a hard time putting together a committee
    that would be interested enough in a)a single author study of
    ANYBODY and b)any who shared my enthusiasm for both aspects of
    Riding and (Riding) Jackson's work--
    I could find a shared interest with Don Byrd in Contemporaries
    and Snobs (1928) and The Telling (1972), but he didn't care much
    for the poetry. Pierre Joris kept on confusing Riding with Mina
    Loy when I brought her up to him (and put one of her most
uncharacteristic poems in the MILLENIUM anthology). I thought the
Dickensonian there (Helen Elam) might have come to appreciate
    what I see as clear resonances (both thematically and rhythmically)
    in some of the early poems, but no go. Anyway, it does seem hard
    to find people who appreciate the range of her work--even
    antagonisticaly.
    I do largely agree with Lisa though--that (at this point in my
    writing and/or life) I am more interested in the earlier work
    than Rational Meaning (though many of the late essays, and The
    Telling, are definitely worth reading---and I do think that an
    understanding of the poetry may benefit by reading them. There's
    a very interesting relationship between the "early" and "later"
    works, not really adequately reducible to a "post-renunciation"
    binary)--yet I would include FOUR UNPOSTED LETTERS TO CATHERINE
    (certainly as important as Rilke's letters to a young poet--though
     my students found it too preachy; i guess i like being preached
     to--sometimes, at least; depending on how it's done) and
    CONTEMPORARIES AND SNOBS (and early essays like "A Prophecy
    or a Plea" or the chapter on Shakespeare and Cummings in "A survey"--
    by the way, maybe those who have problems with Riding might
    appreciate the early work in "FIRST AWAKENINGS" more. I think
    this book is certainly as good as "THE LOST LUNAR BAEDEKER" by
    LOY). So I wonder if Lisa's "early" vs. "late", really works--
    for she, and Charles B., and others who claim to prefer the
    "early" Riding generally do not include this book as one of
    the favs. Perhaps because by the terms of C AND S, these writers
    (and probably myself too) would be considered "snobs"---
    I should probably plug LIVES OF WIVES too (which "our"
    Douglass Messerli published) and definitely THE WORD "WOMAN"--
    all of these written before 1938

    I guess I'll say one thing more here about the conference--
    The "board" people (largely british) objected (among other things)
     to the theorization that was seen in the american academics' papers
     --yet themselves could not effectively articulate a response to
    these papers. So, there was a very interesting moment when
    "OUR" charles bernstein changed the terms, and pointed out
     that the "theorists" (watten, samuels, schultz, but not me)
     were really--or should I say also--poets, and that the
     "binary" that was perceived by many of the loudest voices
     was not really between unquestioned acceptance of (Riding) Jackson's
     works on one hand and a more critically antagonistic (yet
     academically inflected) approach on the other, but, rather,
     between those who would claim the later writings were
     "even better" than the poetry and those who were POETS---
     but I would still argue that this reframing of the argument
     on Bernstein's part does seem to imply that one must be
     THEORETICALLY inflected, and privileges the "legitimizing"
     discourse of Zizek ETC.,by--in effect--claiming that
     one must be theoretically inflected in order to be a POET.

     There are other ways to read this, I know. For instance,
     it did seem that the "antagonistic" writers did have more
     of a personality and that perhaps the brits took (Riding) JAckson
     in too dour a sense, and did not emphasize the moments in her
     writing--apparent even in her later writing I think--in which
    she isn't really asking for complete unwavering subordination
    to HER views. On this level, I would be very much aligned with
    the less "reverential" american theorist-poet-critics. But I still
    find many unanswered questions about the motivations of the
    "alternative" viewpoint that seemed to try to co-opt L(R)J into
    the terms of american academic discourse under the guise of
    defending her poetry....
    It was noteworthy that nobody (myself included)--even those who
    claimed to be very moved by her poetry--could yet offer readings
    of the poems in their talks. Perhaps the framing, the myth, the FIGURE
    of L(R)J is still too much in the way ("Life size is too large").
    I would like to see more of this at some point, and still believe
    that one can use Riding's, er, (Riding) Jackson's own writings
    AS a theoretical grid by which to read her poems (or poems by
    others), and I think her "crankiness" (in which I find much
    generous, good-natured humour by the way) is but one of many
    "roles" she played, in order to foster a possibility that one
    may have more intelligent, critical even, discussion of poetry
    and all forms of writing (whether literary or not) without having
    to constantly appeal to "legitimizing" theoretical writing.
    In this sense, one can see the "later" Riding Jackson IN the
    "earlier" poems by Riding; the poetry can also be used as a
    "theory" by which to read the "non-poetic" writing....

    I don't know if any of this is going to be helpful to those
    who have not yet found pleasure or relevance or whatever in her,
    and I need to unpack many of these ideas further
    (since Riding IS daunting), but I had to at least say something
    more here in these email suburbs.......

Subject:      theoretical/practical thoughts -- origin of the cliche

query on originality

ok listservers, i'm throwing in for comment/analysis some thoughts
i've been having on that favorite of our sujects, writing.  their focal
point is originality.

i got in my email what purported to be a manifesto for rebel poets.
the problem, for me, with this manifesto was that it was chock-a-block
with cliches.  "fire in the belly" was the one i particularly
remember.  i simply could not reconcile the notion of being a rebel
with the use of tired stale phrases in any aspect of writing -- the
actual writing or the marketing/promotional/theory/criticism around
it.

if you like, a query more specific than the one going on the
exchanged, perceptual generia of writing from a "school," or
"movement."

i get to see a very wide range of writing -- everything from amateur
to polished, from formal to langpo, from traditional to
so-new-it-isn't-even- a-"school."  one consistency i've found is that
when people don't read much (and what they DO read is generally
written by similarly non-reading writers), their writing is rife with
cliche -- anything from "like a moth to a flame" to "her sweet kiss"
to "knows how to treat a lady."  not that they are the only ones to
use cliche -- more on that anon.  definition: when i say cliche, i
don't mean someone who takes a cliche and turns it inside out, uses it
not only conscious that it is a cliche, but intentionally examining
the cliche and unravelling it, as in, for example, gertrude stein, or
our own alan sondheim/jennifer.  no, i mean a cliche placed
contextually such that it is clear it was believed by writer to be a
strong personal, artistic contribution to the poem.

i know there is the lens of cultural studies, as our maria damon is very
good with.  and (forgive me maria if i mis-state this) in that lens, there
is not, per se, the cliche so much as a phrase or word-arrangment representing
something to the user, communicating something.  and "originality" might in
many ways be marginal to a project of study, as in, for example, an informed,
critical dissection of partridge family episodes (meant _quite_ seriously --
who does what to whom, how, and why, adn when, using what language, could be
extremely informative).

while that is certainly worth factoring in, i am trying to puzzle out,
more, how cliches function, what it says about the writing, the
writer's thinking, the writing context being imagined and invoked.
at first, and still i must admit, part of me winces, and feels
inclined to dismiss the user of a cliche.  it feels dishonest in a
combination of ways -- 1) socially dishonest/distasteful, as in the
man in the hemingway story who brags about the size of fish he claims
he caught, whilst his wife, who REALLY caught the fish, listens.
cheezy.  bad form.  2) in scholarly way -- a form of plagiarism.  use
of someone's words meant to seem as if they were your own in context
where specifically, one's use of words, ways with them, are what is at
stake.

but i've seen cliches in the writing of more skilled writers.  indeed, one
of the things one does in writing workshops, i've often found, is to be a sort
of cliche-screener, pointing them out as one would any other weakness in early
drafts.  i've learned to look for them in my own writing.  and found them.

from latter experience, i developed two points of origin for the
cliche: 1) when working from strong, fairly fully developed
conception, one might be trying to fill in a section of plot/writing
whilst simultaneously trying to hurry and get to a section several
plot twists/phrases/lines on so as not to forget the bit in one's
head.  in that situation, one can sometimes jam in a cliche just as a
sort of temporary place marker, or filler -- cliches can sum up/stand
in for/remind one of fairly complex material.  i've learned to mark
this in some way, and go back later.  otherwise, one lets the
sounding/phrases of this into one's editing consciousness and it is
easy to lose sight of the cliched fill-in quality.  2) you are writing
from another person's phrasing/voice.  specific: i found, once, when
writing a technical-writing peice where i felt unsure, that i was
adopting a sort of "voice of authority" cribbed out of, i later
realized, documentaries on the subject.  which, upon examination, were
stuffed with the cliche, i.e. "in the beating heart of the sea, life,
it's splendor and tragedy, goes on..." (DIDN'T use this dreadful
sentence, just bring it up as typical example.  NO ONE will EVER see
the particular sentences -- they've been burned, and the ashes sown
into fields, and buildings they were burned in razed to the ground,
and hangin' was too good for 'em, sez i...

but against this background, the almost unimaginable originality, singular
point-of-writing/technique/view of many extraordinary writers.  for example,
stein.  or joyce.  or niedecker.  or e. bishop.  or m. moore.  or thomas
browne, or g. herbert, or c. smart.  k. acker.  etc.  as if the writing is
so inherently _personal_, distinctly arrived at, that cliche is almost
impossible -- the writing is NEW, new-minted, direct from a recognizable
conscioussness.

unmediated?  is cliche the intrusion of other into a "self" writing?
the use of "other" to somehow palatiate, water down, an utterly
personal -- perhaps threateningly so (to writer, or in writers
perception, to other people) -- line of thought/inquir?.  a calling in
of "authority," of other people to bolster what feels like a moment of
terrible loneliness and exposure?  a temporary drift into a sort of group
consciousness, or voice from out of the individual solitary of original
writing?  can "original" uncliched writing COME from a group?

anyway, any thoughts anyone?

Gary,

Is this poem a meditation on deixis? To be "out of place" would then be a
condition of pronominality. "I am not them," which is "the first
transformation," (and the first defintion) bespeaks the differential nature
of 'sign' (which is in French pronounced the same as the word for 'swan,'
an old pun that Spicer may have gotten from Proust or Baudelaire).
Everything's context bound, and the context's constantly shifting. Nothing
is in it's place, because pronouns have no place. They are everyone's and
no-one's, everywhere and nowhere.

This says little about water (or for that matter garden, which has its
history as well), so I don't know how much it aides us. Nor do I really
have any adequate knowledge of the strains of linguistic research that
Spicer may have been following here (he published an article on
linguistics, didn't he?). To clarify 'substrate,' though: I was using it
cosmologically, meaning that for Thales everything was ultimately water in
varying degrees of purification, and I don't see that kind of a notion
being advanced on Spicer's part. Actually, beyond Anaxiamnder even, I think
Heraclitus, indeed, is the figure for this, particularly given Spicer's
having figured the whole poem in terms of conflict, contentiousness,
"hatred," and "enemies." (But then for Heraclitus, of course, all is
fire...

I'm enjoying this conversation...

We still seem to be talking at cross-purposes - I'm not suggesting
ur-music at all - I'm questioning your testing method.  If the process
of breaking sounds into syllables & reassembling them as words is
universal to language, isn't it possible that this universal is
disrupting your experiment?  How can you say you detect a "neutral music"
underlying variations in performance without taking this into account?
That is all I'm saying. The process of syllable- and word-formation
might establish a sort of standard rhythm for all speech, which might be
what you are hearing - the sameness of the same.  - Henry G.

hmm, chris, that wasn't so much confusion as my old frustrated desire to get

Every poem should include at least this many impossible things.

Making light of my experimental proposals isn't difficult - certainly not
impossible, especially if you take them literally, in good non-poetic fashion.
Biblical literalists do it all the time.  I doubt whether many have run
through J. Mayhew's list of fantastic experiments either.  But my point was
to suggest some issues that rarely get much focus on this "innovative" list.
Such as the role of the poet as individual "social actor" or historical
witness.  In a literary market economy where the money lies in mysteries,
thrillers, biographies, self-help books, and the rest of the mountain of
conventional self-adjuster-release mechanisms, it's become an assumption that
innovative or alternative poetries should just set up their own alternative
networks and produce produce produce and publish publish publish and promote
promote promote in ways that simply mirror the commercial sector.  Whatever
happened to the poet's role as political intepreter or exemplar?  As
outcast or participant in real events and political issues?  I am not
thinking so much of the "poet in prison" paradigm of various tyrannies,
but of Whitman's example of the poet who insinuates him or herself into
larger historical dramas (nursing the Civil War wounded), or even more
pertinent, of the poet who makes the writing process consciously related
to or dependent on an existential situation - the poet as reporter (can't
think of an example offhand).   Another aspect of this is the question
of value & production - how do you compare the enormous oeuvres of
contemporary poets with someone like Vallejo, for example - whose poetry
is of great interest precisely because of the collision between creative
innovation and existential (poor, emigre, exile, embattled) reality
that is expressed throughout.  What is precious about poetry if it simply
mimics the mass commercial popularity & success contest - if it declines
to "reach into the wound & heal it" as Mandelstam puts it (Slate Ode)?
What is the value of innovation for innovation's sake?  More specifically,
what, if any, is its political or moral purpose? But that's a boring way
to address these issues - the question is what do we value in poetry -
technique, or technique justified by moral perception & commitment?
Where is the ethos, the criticism of life and human ways, the wisdom?
Where is the pathos of solidarity with non-literary pursuits?

Some "random thoughts" on a "thought-provoking" post:

I only write in cliches, but you mean the unconscious ones used by amateur
writers. Moving up the scale, there are commonplaces used in particular
schools of writing. I'm thinking of "deep image" poetry for example:  a
particular vocabulary seen to be intrinsically poetic, or lyrical:  deep,
dark,same,sound, sky, empty, stone, whole, always, desire, silence,
memory, dead, dawn.  Merwin or Gluck (Louise) would know better than to
use stock phrases of the sort you cited in your post, but their language
is often trite all the same.

Maybe instead of teaching beginning writers to avoid cliches, writing
workshops could teach them to write only* in cliches, that way writers
would at least know that that* is what they are doing. Then if they wanted
to avoid certain commonplaces they could do it more easily. This could be
done even at a fairly sophisticated level. There are the cliches of
Langpo, vizpo, etc...

Michael Riffaterre's Semiotics of Poetry contends that poems are written
through the transformation of cultural commonplaces.

If we said "good writers avoid cliches" wouldn't that be the first entry
in a Dictionary of Received Ideas? Or, as Oscar Wilde might have said,
"only unoriginal writers worry about avoiding cliches."

yknow typically i read poetics b/c i want insight into, not the critical
apparatus per se, but the more generative side of the
author-text-reader-context continuum...

but reading the various remarks on riding-jackson---which i've really
enjoyed---and several other threads, i feel compelled for some reason to do
the continental... to wit (and the following excerpt begins with more than
a touch of irony):

"... how can one reduce the great peril, the great danger with which
fiction [read poetry too, e.g.] threatens our world?  the answer is:  one
can reduce it with the author.  the author allows a limitation of the
cancerous and dangerous proliferation of significations within a world
where one is thrifty not only with one's resources and riches, but also
with one's discourses and their significations.  the author is the
principle of thrift in the proliferation of meaning.  as a result, we must
entirely reverse the traditional idea of the author.... the author is not
an indefinite source of significations which fill a work; the author does
not precede the works, he is a certain functional principle by which, in
our culture, one limits, excludes, and chooses; in short, by which one
impedes the free circulation, the free manipulation, the free composition,
decomposition, and recomposition of fiction ... the author is therefore the
ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the
proliferation of meaning.  in saying this i seem to call for a form of
culture in which fiction would not be limited by the figure of the author.
it would be pure romanticism, however, to imagine a culture in which the
fictive would operate in an absolutely free state, in which fiction would
be put at the disposal of everyone and would develop without passing
through something like a necessary or constraining figure."

these words will no doubt be familiar to many of you---from foucault's
little, (academically) influential 1969 essay, "what is an author?"... i
offer them here not as a corrective to anyone's thinking on the
matter---and certainly not to privilege one way of thinking over another
(and certainly not to condescend to anyone)---but simply with the aim of
suggesting that the discussion of riding-jackson's work in particular would
seem to benefit from an exploration of her status as "author," with quotes
intact---i.e., the way the author-function (foucault's term, in
translation) works in her case... you can go the zizek route too---any
number of critical routes, in fact... but it strikes me that a diverse
array of works (an oeuvre, if you like), in prose and poetry, works that
present us with contradictory intertextual appeals, might benefit from
scrutiny as to the way the or an "author" emerges in our attempts to "get
at" same... it's probably too easy, too, to simply attribute such works to
multiple authors (and this in itself, and as foucault suggests, would
likely become, however multiple, a "constraining figure")...

a matter of emphasis?---perhaps... no, i don't know quite how to proceed
with regard to riding-jackson in particular, but i can almost get a glimpse
of how one might...

best,

joe

this, from today's NYT, is a rare piece of good news -- Pierre


                   LAGOS, Nigeria -- Wole Soyinka, Nigeria's exiled
Nobel literature
                   laureate, returned home Wednesday, nearly four years
after
                   fleeing the military dictatorship he vigorously
opposed.

              As Nigeria's most prominent exile, the playwright's return
is an
              important expression of confidence in the promise by the
country's
              military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, to restore
democracy in the
              West African country.

              Hundreds of well-wishers sang freedom songs in Soyinka's
native
              Yoruba language at the international airport in Lagos.
They surged
              toward him as he emerged from a flight from Germany just
after 7.30
              P.M.

              Soyinka drove straight to the home of Moshood K. O.
Abiola, the
              presumed winner of 1993 elections who died in detention in
July after
              being locked up for claiming his mandate on the basis of
the vote that
              was annulled by the army.

              "What I looked forward to so much was the day I would hug
Abiola, but
              that never happened," Soyinka said. "Let us not talk about
that now. Let
              us concentrate on the inspiration that Abiola and his
family have been to
              us."

              Soyinka, the winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for
Literature, left Nigeria
              secretly in 1994 after Gen. Sani Abacha, the late
dictator, banned him
              from traveling. He had led street protests against
military rule and for
              the recognition of Abiola as President, and his outspoken
criticism of the
              junta from inside Nigeria and later from abroad has made
him an
              important opposition symbol to many Nigerians.

              From exile, he called on Western countries to impose
sanctions to force
              General Abacha to step down and warned that armed struggle
might be
              needed to end military rule. In 1997 he was charged in
absentia for
              treason over a bombing campaign.

              Most of his time was spent in the United States where he
taught at
              Emory University in Atlanta.

              Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with more than 104
million
              people, has undergone a swift reopening since General
Abacha's
              sudden death in June. General Abubakar says he will step
down next
              May. He has freed dozens of political prisoners and last
month called on
              all exiles to return home to take part in the new
democracy plan after
              dropping charges against them. Several have returned in
response to
              the call.

              General Abubakar is from the north, as were General Abacha
and most
              of Nigeria's rulers since independence from Britain in
1960.

              Soyinka and General Abubakar met in New York last month
and the
              general asked Soyinka to come home.

              "He is not the type who will return and fold his arms,"
said Tunji
              Adebiyi, a political activist. "Even if he wanted to, his
supporters from
              across the country will not allow him to, as they will be
looking up to
              him for direction."

My thoughts exactly.  Oh. . .damn. . . I'm doing it too, receiving ideas from
Wilde.   I suppose in the end it's not the size or source of your reception,
but what you do with it that matters.  I think that's also what McGrand is
getting at, that in spite of how various theoretical positions might
complicate how we think about "cliches,"  what do you do practically, if you
are in a classroom and confronted by students who write, what to you, looks
unbearably derivative, pre-rehearsed, stilted, or just plain dull?  And I
think McGrand's insights are helpful (thought familiar), at least in that they
get us to think about "cliche" as something other than a particular category
of scribbles on the page. For me it has as much to do with reception and
context as anything else.  "I wanted to put a bug in your ear" is a cliche of
conversation, of course, but when it shows up on an old episode of Night
Gallery, it's not the same thing at all.

These questions, however, still keep me awake at night:

1)  Rather than focusing our aim on increasing awareness of cliches, or
placing prohibitions on cliches, shouldn't we be putting our time into
encouraging whatever the opposite of cliche is?

That is to say. . . if I get a piece of writing that seems so limited in its
use of language that every expression is a dead metaphor or a hackneyed
expression--the last thing I want to limit that writing further.  Or. . .if
student writer writes in cliches because some editor-within is telling them to
(You must sound like an author to have authority", aren't we giving them
another homuncular-editor-within that, rather than wrestling away the first
voice, is simply including another voice,(Look, another example of your lack
of [author]ity and [able]ity")

2)  Is there something developmental at stake here?   Do most poets
struggle through a period of cliched writing that later embarasses the hell
out of them?  If so. . .is our role to pre-empt these embarrassments?  Or is
getting a beginning poet to write with only "original" language similar to
getting a basic writer to try and write only in long, complicated sentences?

(Note:  this is neither a rhetorical question, nor a question which I am
stating because I think the answer is "yes."  I'm asking if anyone has ever
actually done developmental research on student poets, or poets in general?
Where would I look?)

Hi, this is Dodie.  I'm going to be teaching Ethics inWriting to
undergraduate English majors.  I want to cover all the things that get tail
feathers ruffled on this list:  racism, essentialism, privacy issues,
ownership, censorship, Ezra Pound or someone similarly problematic and
those issues, exclusion, the problematic use of the word "we"--also need to
talk a bit about legal issues.

My question is, does anyone have any advice--important essays, books, etc.
that would be accessible/interesting to undergraduates?

A friend of mine did a search of Aristotle and Ethics on the classics web
and sent me her findings.  It was brain-death for me, but a starting point.
Particularly interesting was the stuff about slaves having no rights . . .

Thanks for any input.

Small Press Traffic presents

Tony Lopez
Spencer Selby

Friday, October 16, 7:30 p.m.
New College Theater
777 Valencia Street
$5

With False Memory and Negative Equity Tony Lopez's career, hitherto
glimpsed in bits and pieces, comes into focus like a shift in the
kaleidoscope or my binoculars. His writing makes a person nervous,
painfully conscious of the falsities that simplify and abbreviate our
lives. But he is a kind master, and provides plenty of pleasure along with
the pain. Come on down and show Mr. Lopez a real good time at his first
reading in San Francisco. Tony Lopez, born in 1950, has written Snapshots
(1976), Abstract & Delicious (1982), A Theory of Surplus Labour (1990),
Stress Management (1994) and Negative Equity (1995). His first US book was
False Memory published by The Figures in 1996. Recent work appears in many
international magazines and in the anthologies Conductors of Chaos, (edited
by Iain Sinclair, Picador, 1996) and The Poets Calendar for the Millennium
(Sun & Moon, 1997). He teaches in England at the University of Plymouth.

Spencer Selby lives in San Francisco. He's the author of five books of
poetry, and two more forthcoming (The Big R, Angle Press, and Task, from
Zasterle Press), and two of visual poetry, Stigma (Score, 1990, and
Malleable Cast (Generator, 1995). He has moved through the experimental
formalism of the 80s ("This is the voice of description speaking") into a
new and more highly evolved and humanistic version of the "Spencerian
stanza," which he invented way back when in his more acerbic, abrasive
days. Selby's recent work gives off a palpable warmth and directness that's
refreshingly new. This isn't your father's Spencer Selby.

Just wanted to second the motion that people go to this. Just heard Tony
Lopez read in Tucson two nights ago, and he was marvelous, despite the fact
that with trans-atlantic, then trans-american, and finally cal-arizona
travel, he basically hadn't slept in three days. In addition to what is
said here, for Tony Lopez, listen closely -- there's a fireworks in the
verbal artistry which is amazing and holds everything together in a quite
compelling manner. And, having hears Spencer read a couple of times, I have
to say that I'd go again anytime I was within range.  And I can only wish
that my father had a Spencer Selby.

in light of the mike barnicle/patricia smith imbroglio, what about
touching on plagiarism as well -- for example, what differentiates
collaged "found" writing from plagiarism, how should/must you

Hello listees.

Sitting here under stacks of publications that people have sent me of late,
probably assuming that I'd get them reviewed in Rhizome, was struck by the
fact that I simply can't run reivews of every chapbook or perfect bound book
that comes my way.  I'd like to call attention to a couple of things that I've
received that are particularly exciting and won't be reviewed in Rhizome,
probably not anywhere.

Elizabeth Treadwell's The Erratix and Other Stories is a crazy ride through
something faintly narrative, but packed with wild detours and short poems,
lots of fairytale madness.  (Published by Texture Press.  PO Box720157 Norman
Oklahoma).

Another stack that I have is from Guy Bennett's SEEING EYE.  He's done chaps
of Clark Coolidge (THE BOOK OF STIRS), Lynn Heijian, Mohammed Dibb (simply
stunning translations from Paul Vangelisti), and most recently Bob Crosson.

The Book of Stirs is one long poem sustained by lots of swing, by far the best
of the Coolidge stuff to appear in print lately.

Bob Crosson will be in the next issue of MrKnife, MissFork and has been in
Rhizome and Ribot most recently but he remains the best kept secret in L.A.
although he's been publishing alongside all the Temblor crowd for all this
time.  This chapbook In Aethers of the Amazon is truly deranged.

Crosson comes out of the Stein/Spicer and takes a lot of chances, a lot
unusual gambits with diction/syntax, but always swings back with lovely and
quotable lines like "To Rabbits it is all rabbits.  It is not frogs."

The real strength of the SEEING EYE series is Guy Bennett's typography.  He
knows the difference between desktop publishing and book designing.

Other remarkably well-produced books in the series include Catriona Strang and
very shortly Eleani Sikleanos.

SEEING EYE is located at 12011 Rochester Ave. #9 LA, CA 90025
I don't have Guy's e-mail address but if anyone does, they should post it as I
know Guy will take orders that way.  (Also, visit the LA Books Web site)

Other recent releases of note include the Poetry NY Pamphlet series.  Laura
Moriarty's Spicer's City is not at all a sentimental homage.  Possibly it is
my favorite of that series although the Enslin is also very nice.

Avec Books has just released Ogling Anchor from Chris Reiner.  He really knows
his way around the prose peom.  Gave a lovely reading here the other day.
There's a romantic often surreal feel to these pieces.

Also Susan Smith's  Nash Dooms Day Belly which is from Trip Street Press and
says it is available through S.P.D.

AVEC Sampler #2 has outstanding work from George Albon (as to be expected) as
well as a long exciting series from Joe Ross, translations of Alferi, a really
strong piece from Andrew Joron (that addresses some issues of translation,
obliquely) and work by Camille Guthrie who is relatively new to me, but her
work is consistently haunting and lyrical.

Just want to call attention to this stuff in case people haven't seen it.
Like I said, I wish I could get each of these reviewed in detail for Rhizome
but this current issue is filled.

Please buy that Robert (Bob) Crosson book from SEEING EYE.  It is some of the
most stirring prose/poetry to be found anywhere.

I am peculiarly ready to say that "I am" seems to sign off a lot on Riding
and that Joe Amato might be for the dust off Foucault alert to
a cramping or lidding effect that has contained various authors
including it seems Riding to author status as if agency was enthralled to
its nostalgia. And also I too I too was desperate to attend the Riding
event but now having read the posts about it I am not at all sorry I
missed it not at all. I have not I that is I have not been taken by
anything that has been said so far about the event or about Riding on the
No Ads All Hits UBPoetics mesmer. And I am I am I the first to taste the
pleasures of pointing to this or to that as the best or the worst of her
pleats. May I continue and say continue in May or not it stands to
feasible doubt that there is less to say about Riding and more to say
about Riding as a dissipated author function as, instead, function as a
limit she found a limit she found she thought the limit but she certainly
found a limit not Stein's limit either. She founds limits she detected
them she incised them on the social space she found and only partly
inhabitable. How can you take away that limit finder to bind her to her.

I've been trying all day to come up with a real opposite of cliche (one issued
raised by Ted Fristrom) and I think "truly deranged" is a pretty good one.

Good derangement cannot be taught, though some learn it on their own, whether
their early cliches are harshly criticized or not.

The D=E=R=A=N=G=E=M=E=N=T school poets have usually never met each other, in fact,
some of them have never met anyone at all.

I simply do not believe in an old cliche--

artist/poet as "outlaw"

as a writer I do not position myself OUTSIDE of society--
as the term OUTlaw seems to say--oddly enough--
that one has broken some/thing (a law?)--and that
writing a poem for me would not --no--change the world

nor would I want it too.

One way to proceed is to figure out her authorship of other people's
work. Some years ago I edited the selected critical essays of Len
Lye, a friend of Laura and Robert in the London and Majorca years.
One essay, 'Film-making' which first appeared in Epilogue I in 1935,
is co-authored with Laura Riding. In style and in much of its
substance it is her work, and a remarkable piece. She also gave Lye a
certain permission ( and no doubt some advice) on to produce prose
poems, and her Seizin Press published a selection of  them. I am
aware that during the years in Majorca there were a number of writers
in residence writing under pretty close supervision, whose published
works from the time do n ot also carry her name. I wonder how much is
known of her covert authorship?

The latest news of work completed here at the Blake Archive. Apologies for
cross-posting. Please forward as appropriate. Matt

--

16 October 1998

The editors of the William Blake Archive
<http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake> are pleased to announce the
publication of four new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated
books. They are:

_The Ghost of Abel_ copy A (The Library of Congress)

_On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil_ copies B (The Fitzwilliam Museum) and
F (The Pierpont Morgan Library)

_Laocoon_ copy B (collection of Robert N. Essick)

These three works are Blake's final illuminated books, their composition
dateable between 1822 (_The Ghost of Abel_, _On Homers Poetry [and] On
Virgil_) and c. 1826-27 (_Laocoon_). In the words of Sir Geoffrey Keynes,
they offer Blake's "Last Testament" on subjects ranging from aesthetic
theory to political economy, from forgiveness to apocalyptic judgment. A
drama in miniature, _The Ghost of Abel_ addresses "Lord Byron in the
Wilderness" (plate 1) and, more specifically, the issues of vengeance
and forgiveness raised by Byron's _Cain: A Mystery_ (1821). The broadsheet
_On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil_ challenges these representative figures
of classical learning, with special emphasis on concepts of unity as an
artistic ideal, identity, and the destructive consequences of
imperialism. There are five copies extant for each of these works,
which, like most of Blake's illuminated books, were produced in relief
etching; the _Laocoon_ plate, which is an intaglio etching/engraving, is
extant in two copies. Through a careful representation and restoration of
the famous Hellenistic sculptural group, Blake attempts to return the
_Laocoon_ to its supposed Hebraic origins and its allegorical meanings,
revealed by the terse yet intellectually expansive texts with which Blake
surrounds the central image.

All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and are all
fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique
Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.  We
now have twenty-six copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive.
Late this year and early in the next, we will add _Milton_ copy D and
_Jerusalem_ copy E. We will also be adding at least six more copies of
_Songs of Innocence and of Experience_, two copies of _Songs of
Innocence_, five copies of _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, four
copies of _The Book of Urizen_, and two copies each of _America, a
Prophecy_ and _Europe, a Prophecy_. In addition, by the end of 1998 we
will provide a fully-searchable SGML edition of David V. Erdman's
_Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake_.

In the coming weeks we will also be opening a brand-new wing of the
Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an
updated and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial
Principles and Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design
and implementation, a list of Frequently Asked Questions, an in-depth
illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to
use its resources, and more. Our hope is that these extensive
documentary materials will prove valuable both to our own growing user
community as well as to scholars interested in the theory and practice
of electronic editing more generally. We will make a separate
announcement when these materials are available on the site.

Finally, on our recently opened Contributing Collections page, we plan
to begin adding color-coded and linked lists of each institution's
entire Blake collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive
and what is forthcoming. In addition to providing a convenient index of
the scope and contents of the Archive, these lists should also be useful
to scholars in planning research trips.

Reva Wolf, in her book _Any Warhol, Poetry & Gossip in the 1960s_, has a
somewhat more subtle take on this topic.  Discussing Berrigan's plagarisms
(petty crimes) she writes: "The poet, in short, is a criminal because he does
not receive a regular payment for his work;  his work is illegitimate."  As
she observes, Berrigan's theft of words was not only metaphorical; being broke
-- not having a legitimate job --Berrigan regularly stole books as well,
something he incorporates into his idea of who he was as a poet -- sampling, I
don't think, is as interesting a practice without the tang of theft attaching
to it.

Gary,

What a lovely post (although it's _apeiron_, and not aporia, although the
root may be the same(?)). Love, of course, for Spicer - for whom the 'one
night stand' was a thing of the past by the time of what's in the
_Collected Books_ - is a serious and tragic issue, perhaps precisely
because of this language from which one cannot escape. Language draws
distinctions. It parses, separates, supperates. (G. Spencer-Brown's
extraordinary thesis in _Laws of Form_: "a universe comes into being when a
space is severed or taken apart..."). This, for me, gives rise to magic:


      "Things fit together. We knew that -- it is the principle of magic.
   Two inconsequential things can combine together to form a consequence."

                        Spicer, to Blaser, in _Admonitions_


In Olson, for example, (the Olson for whom a faith in coherent cosmology,
based in pre-Socraticism, is everywhere apparent) nothing is
inconsequential: each unique event is underwritten by a cosmological
'truth'. In Spicer, "nothing" is inconsequential: everything else is like
blocks of wood knocking against one another, creating magical truths which
are multiple and conflicting - and never resolute. (Heraclitian strife
indeed...). (?)

I'm still coming to terms with much of your post, but I'll send this along
for now, for momentum's sake...

Stephen


PS- In Nate Mackey's _Bedouin Hornbook_ (the first letter of which is cc'd
to Spicer and Lorca), N. recalls a drummer once telling him that "if the
harmony of the spheres were to come near me, I'd pop it upside the jaw..."
I wonder how this might apply to Spicer, or might describe his stance w/
regard to the wholeness cosmology implies? There's another great passage as
well, where N.'s describing a piece of music:

"Graspability is a self-incriminating thirst utterly native to every hand,
an indigenous court from which only the drowned hope to win acquittal. The
piece makes use of two triadic phrases which I call utility riffs:
'Whatever beginnings go back to' and 'an exegetical refusal to be done with
desire.' These generate a subtheme which could put as follows: Thirst is by
its nature unquenchable, the blue lips of a muse whose refusals roughen our
throats with duende."


I hope I've not broken orbit here, but might this inform a reading of
Spicer? Of the tension of form and formlessness as the crux of erotic law?
(Love looking for space before severance, for 'whatever beginnings go back
to...")?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

From my limited knowledge of L(R)J -- based largely on _Selected Poems in
Five Sets_, smatterings of her prose, and what some others have accurately
or inaccurately written about her -- I'd guess she'd chafe at the idea of
anyone (even Chris S.) appropriating her work/ideas in any remotely
"personalized" way -- my, our, whoozit's -- because that approach would
contradict her more "universally" apprehensible aspirations. The woman
seemed to be mercury -- try to hold her in your hand and she scatters into
a zillion pieces: no, she wouldn't mean what you mean her to mean at all,
even if she meant to be meant that way originally. But I find her
interesting for that very reason.

When I was in my grad creative writing program 20 years ago, L(R)J was PNG.
A friend of mine who wanted to study her poetry was met with a monolithic
(and, if I remember, self-righteous) No; hearing the echo all the way back
in my shabby, mouse-ridden apartment, I took the hint and stayed away too.
Oh yeah, I snuck a look at her now and then (flashlight under the covers so
the Poetry Police wouldn"t catch me) and didn't find much I connected with.
But then, as I got used to reading the Objectivists, the Projectivists,
Language Poets, un po' dei Novissimi, and other non-representational
schools, the L(R)J poems that I ran across became easier to read. I
belatedly realized that L(R)J's unique talent to piss *everybody* off is
the fun of the paradox. For decades, she undermines the ideas that
representational poets and critics -- like realist landscape painters --
have dedicated their lives to: capturing Truth via poetry.
Then along comes postmodern indeterminacy and the idea that it's okay not
to expect Truth from poetry/language, that in fact such Truth -- if there
even is such a thing -- eludes communication by such means ("This is not
exactly what I mean/Any more than the sun is the sun" -- uh, Mr. Bronk? Ms.
(Riding) Jackson on line 3). Match made in heaven, no? No, because L(R)J
still insists that Truth exists, and that its transmission through language
is possible, albeit not via poetry. That Absolutist thing again.

If I visualize all our 20th-century thinking-about-poetry as an ouroboros,
then to me L(R)J marks the point where the serpent has his tail and eats
it, too. Like it or not, it's a fairly special (even stimulating) position
to occupy. Sure, as Prof. Perloff says, the language of L(R)J's poems can
be "abstract" and "stilted," but I've thought the same way about Creeley at
various times. And Pound. And St. Gertrude. And Olson. And H.D. And dozens
of tweedy 1950/60's formalist poets whose books I keep re-buying at used
book sales because I keep forgetting I already had them and didn't like
them and actually donated them to the sale to begin with.

The Cornell symposium -- the very idea of which Prof. Perloff found
"bizarre" -- was really a blast (within restrained academic limits, of
course) because all the contradictions surrounding L(R)J's work were
together in one room, squeaking and flopping against each other. It was
certainly fascinating to me, and I'm not a cult follower by any means.
Admire her or not, L(R)J is there like the stone wedged in your roto
tiller: eventually you'll have to try to extract it without losing some
fingers.

There's a touch of Hermes, patron of thieves, in poets ('tis said).
(Mercury gave Apollo his lyre). Maybe it's part of the package... like
it or not... contradicting (or supporting?) the message with deviant
social behavior... secrecy, passage, a swiftness of mind and hand...

Hope to see some of you there.

The following are excerpts from Garrett Kalleberg and Heather Ramsdell's
poetry:

Garrett Kalleberg, from "An Undisturbed Song of Pure Content"

There is a thing
or there are several things
which, recollected, are one thing
and this thing is a thought
or is a way of thinking
or is a way of undergoing
in the way that the tree grows
in the wind outside
the window, in the way that
the gate closes and footsteps are carried
down the street until the hand is frozen

in silence, then
scratches away again



Heather Ramsdell, from "Surd"

I am a hand on an arm, I thought
metonymous, at least, but am a bag
of parts.  Sound falls out of me and in me.
It goes, if X, then Z. It says,
An antique object fell from these, and did not break or broke.
and music says, seductively,
permission--a form of imprisonment.
persimmon--the fruit of a tree
dangles, thus

thus verisimilitude,
and cannot reconcile itself.

These are       not        things
not images         not       things  not
matter.

Tic tic.
A pebble in a tin cup, nothing
enough, though no one saw gravity either
carry the avalanche into the valley today.

Thank heaven I know this word now. There's a Macintosh shareware game,
much like the venerable Centipede, called Apeiron, and we used to sit in
the cave huddled around our monitors calling it "ape iron," wondering what
on earth was going on in the game designer's head.

Gwyn! In the mid-80s I was addicted to Centipede and could not, by myself,
physically walk away from a Centipede game if I still had quarters in my
pocket. But, as to "ape iron" ... you know, Gerald Burns' long poem on
narrative ("A Workbook for Readers") begins with an ape (a gorilla, I think)
tearing an iron radiator from the wall. (This is the same poem that uses
Salt & Pepper for, oh, I'm pretty sure, little signifiers for Subject &
Predicate. Maybe?) So, narrative (conflict/as in "war is the king & father
of all things"--Heraclitus, again) is that which, violently?, appears "out
of nowhere" from misty (play "Gorillas in the Mist" for me, bay-bay)
apeiron. A word, Stephen, I totally fucked up in my post cuz I idiotically
trusted my memory. Which is (obviously) not so good.

Which all leads me to this question: I got a backchannel from William
Sylvester about Gerald Burns (Bill wrote on him for the last _House Organ_)
and I'm wondering, does anyone else out there read Burns? And does anyone
know the fate of The Myth of Accidence? Did he ever finish the 12th book?
Did he ever name the 11th? Are there plans to publish it? If you _don't_
read him is it cuz he was, okay, kind of a "difficult" personality? Or cuz
you think his writing sucks? Or, like, what?

Stephen, thank you SO much for pointing out the swan/sign pun. I'm gonna
take your two last posts home with me 2-nite & go back to _Language_ this
weekend.

Eliza, did you know: Cliche was a printer's term for ready-2-use letter
combos (& maybe whole phrases?--Charles Alexander, do you know?).

Bye for now, I have a bag of baby carrots to attend to,

Gary

Can't let this one go.  I was glad Henry provided further clarity, because it
makes our difference clearer.  I withdraw ur-music comment.  But why when
someone talks of poetic "music", do people so frequently redefine that word to
"rhythm" as if no change in the argument had taken place?

Melody and beat are obviously inextricably related.  The mental concept of
stress seems to be formed partly by pitch -- along with duration, loudness,
voice quality, pausing, tempo, mental weighting, proactive and retroactive
expectation, and various other things.  Via pitch and other sonic factors,
therefore, melody is a co-partner with rhythm. But if no one would think of
reducing a song to its beat, why do so many people do that with poetry?

Isn't this one reason why the young are so rarely taught in schools that much
poetry works, basically, in the same way as song?  I agonise often over these
constantly missed chances to turn them on to the craft.  The main differences
are that poetry has no time signature or tonic system, there is no such thing
as a flat note, the intervals are usually smaller than in song, and the tempo
is usually more variable.  Traditional metrics only partly substitute for this
and in my experiments do not impose tempo from one line to the next.

To talk of language's division into syllables and reassemblage into words
would certainly indicate that a sort of unversality underlay poetic music.
Let me agree tentatively that this provides a basis for all spoken poetic
music.  But it doesn't disrupt either my testing procedures (which are not, I
emphasise, "scientific" but merely illustrative) or my sense of neutral tune
-- any more than the provision of separate notes on a guitar and their
combination into chords decides what tune is played.  Or is a better analogy
with music's tonic system?  I don't know.   Whatever these universals are,
then, would represent the way language is "strung" and perhaps this, or
"language tonicity", limit the (immense) number of permissible combinations of
sounds.  But, that limitation is at a very far remove, and I'm not so sure the
combinations aren't infinite.  Will pop music run out of tunes when all
mathematical combinations of notes have been run through?  Possibly, because
the tonic system permits far fewer permissible combinations than language, but
even so the number is pretty large.

Divisions, syllables (very difficult to delimit, actually), words, yes.  Beat
yes.  The beat in ordinary convresation, however, is not "standard" but
depends upon emotional and intellectual stressing of myriad kinds, even though
it tries to tend towards isochrony.  If we confine the argument to "beat", I'd
agree this move towards regularity is influential. But it would not quite get
at "neutral tune'".

For music is, as always, a creation out of existing elements of sound, and
even with a time signature its beat never achieves isochrony -- a good drummer
is not a metronome, because pitch and beat are inextricable, flow is
inextricable from instant, and feelings influence the pulse of things.  In
poetry, add much greater freedom of tempo etc., intellectual weighting, and so
on.  What I'm talking about is the neutral sense that arises from that very
mysterious process, and I repeat that it's ineffable, even though I'd agree
with Henry that it is influenced in its shaping by syllable (that slightly
fluid entity) and word (another entity which can fluidly join onto following
words, e.g. via voicing, as I have shown).

We still seem to be talking at cross-purposes - I'm not suggesting
ur-music at all - I'm questioning your testing method.  If the process
of breaking sounds into syllables & reassembling them as words is
universal to language, isn't it possible that this universal is
disrupting your experiment?  How can you say you detect a "neutral music"
underlying variations in performance without taking this into account?
That is all I'm saying. The process of syllable- and word-formation
might establish a sort of standard rhythm for all speech, which might be
what you are hearing - the sameness of the same.  - Henry G.

Doug, all power to your investigations of these ineffable musical qualities.
Perhaps the word "neutral" led to my associating music merely with rhythm.
However, even if you took pitch etc, into account, it seems like any
regularities you discovered beneath variations in performance would have
to be balanced against the consideration of possible "sound universals" in
all speech. Though you may certainly be onto something - wouldn't you
have to show that these were poetic regularities, and not simply measurements
of internal constants basic to language itself?  - Henry

I've lurked at the edges of the Laura Riding Jackson conversation these
last days, partly because I've never adequately explained to myself why it
is I keep reading her poetry.

One thing, for sure, has changed in the LRJ reception in recent years.  The
first MLA panel I ever attended devoted to her work began with the reading
of a lengthy and fairly convoluted letter from LRJ, the gist of which
seemed to be that she didn't hold out much hope for the endeavor -- I half
expected a posthumous posting from the former poet to the recent conference
--

LRJ still believed that there was "truth," but that it couldn't be
communicated through poetry -- My own sense is that "truth" only exists as
a relationship among statements, and is thus as readily available in poetry
as anywhere else --

I await her judgement --

A few weeks ago, upon the death of former KC Royal relief pitcher Dan
Quisenberry, there was some discussion of his passing, and a passing
discussion of his poetry. Here are excerpts from an article that appeared
in the Chicago Sun Times, written by Dave Hoekstra. It mentions some of
his poetry, and other interesting things about him.

"MORE POET THAN PLAYER"

Kansas City, Mo.-- The sixth annual Dan Quisenberry Haarvester's Celebrity
Golf Classic was held under patchy blue skies last week at Loch Lloyd
Country Club, just south of Kansas City.  The clouds looked like ice cream
cones.
        Quisenberry died Sept. 30 of brain cancer at age 45.  The former
Kansas City  Royals relief ace was on his way to acclaim as a poet. His
first book of peoms, _On Days Like This_ ($12.95) was published in May by
Helicon Nine Editions, a non-profit small press.
        Helicon Nine publisher and editor Gloria Vando Hickok suggested a
baseball motif for the cover of _On Days Like This_, which features 100 of
Quisenberry's poems, about half of which are about baseball.
        "We had quite a fight about the cover," Vando Hickok said in her
office, which is in a 90 year old house called The Writer's Place.  "I
thought it would be wonderful to have a cover of Dan or some baseball
topic. And he said, 'absolutely not!'  He said he'd like a Kansas
landscape. We did three mockups from different area artists.  This one he
liked.  The clouds reminded him of ice cream cones."
        ....The five time American League Fireman of the Year always said
the best part of writing baseball poems was that it helped him get over
the game.
        In 1994, Quisenberry became a student in the Wednesday night
poetry-writing workshop run by Vando Hickok at The Writers Place. He was
one of 14 students sitting in a circle in the former living room of the
old house. He was nothing more and nothing less than his fellow writers.
        "He didn't put on any airs," Vando Hickok said. "He was very
generous and considerate of his comments. He wrote some interesting poems,
and I showed him 'Night Baseball' a phenomenal poem by (Wichita writer)
Michael Blumenthal. He said, 'Well, I have some baseball poems.' He
brought them to me. They were so good...."
        Vando Hickok chose three of Quisenberry's poems and published them
in a 1995 pamplet called _Down and In_.
        Quisenberry's writing carried a rhythm that was seasoned with a
rare air of humility. He was an undrafted baseball player who begged for a
tryout with the Royals in 1975.  As a pet, he understood economy and liked
to play around with style.... Quisenberry's poem "Baseball Cards" appears
in _Down and In_ and in _On Days like This_. It begins

that first baseball card i saw myself
in a triage of rookies
atop the bodies
that made the hill
we played king of
i am the older one
the one on the right
game-face sincere
long red hair unkempt
a symbol of the 70s
somehow a sign of manhood
you don't see
how my knees shook on my debut
or my desperation to make it...

The poem concludes...

i look back
at who i thought i was
or used to be
now, trying to be funny
i tell folks
i used to be famous
i used to be good
they say
we thought you were bigger
i say
i was

Quisenberry's teammates remember him as an avid reader, but they don't
recall him trying to write poetry until afer he retired in 1990.
        "I've read his poems, and he even put me in a couple, for which
I'm flattered," said Willie Wilson, a former Royals and Cubs
centerfielder. "He had a gift for words. He was always reading on the
plane. He always made us laugh. He made us feel like we were good human
beings."
        Paul Splittorff, the winningest pitcher in Royals history, was one
of Quisenberry's teammates from 1979-1984.
        "Dan was the kind of guy who walked around and noticed the simple
things in life" Splittorff said. "I had a feeling he had depth to him when
we played. People said, 'Baseball player and poetry?' I told people he was
more like a poet than he was a baseball player. He was gracious. He was
Gentleman. He was out of character as a relief pitcher. He wasn't
intimidating."
        Qusenberry received his first royalty check in June and planned to
teach a poetry workshop this fall. But fate had other plans.
        Quisenberry made his final public appearance May 30, when more
than 30,000 fans at Kauffman Stadium saw him get inducted into the Royals
Hall of Fame.  Along with his wife, Janie, anad their teenage children,
Alysia and David.  Quisenberry was active in the Colonial Presbyterian
Church in Kansas City, where a memerial service was held the day before
the golf tournament.  Quisenberry left behind some unpublished  poems....
        Ice Cream cones melt away, weven when they are drams floaating
through the sky, but Quisenberry kept aa solid commitment to family,
community and friends. His poems articulate a faith, which is why his
spirit would never be diminished.

Not much along the lines of formal innovation, but I'd like to see one of

inning of a close game.

"And I remember somebody leaning up against the dirt wall of the
hillside, deriding William Carlos Williams, when suddenly there was a loud
roaring, crunching noise and a chunk of the hill fell off and covered the
person up to his neck. The person, being a young classical poet fresh from
NYU, begun screaming that he was being buried alive.  Fortunately, the
landslide stopped and we dug him out and dusted him off. That was the last
time he said anything against William Carlos Williams. The next day he
began reading _Journey to Love_ rather feverishly."

per Alcorn (_Narcissism and the literary libido_, 1994) Foucault also
asserts in the same source text that those "aspects of an individual
which we designate as an author...are projections of our way of handling
texts"

As a practitioner I am curious how you (and others) would see these
quotes applying (or not) to the phenomenon of "interactive" fiction and
poetry on the internet.  As "author/participant" I don't see
interactivity on the internet as significantly (to my disappointment)
different than available in print works?

Alcorn also argues that critics are prone to ignore complex theories
implied in their use of terms which leads to vagueness in their use of
concepts at times.  E.g., Lacan and Kristeva are primarily practitioners
while those who use their terms are generally neither primarily analysts
or poets.

tom, foucault's thinking, in that piece in fact, along with the work of
other structuralists and poststructuralists, led george landow some years
ago to speculate in precisely the directions you suggest... so rather than
offering my thoughts here, i'll simply cite landow's _hypertext:  the
convergence of contemporary critical theory and technology_ (johns hopkins,
1992; landow cites "what is an author?" four times)... a follow-up volume
of essays edited by landow, _hyper/text/theory_ (johns hopkins, 1994),
challenges any easy equations between cont. theory and new media... if
you've looked at either/both of these and are interested in what we can say
*now*, with five more years of web/internet experience under our cultural
belt, my apologies for being so pedantic (!)...

anyway, i've found both volumes of use in trying to sort out the issues,
though the tendency is to deal with narrative rather than poetry... there's
lots more 'out there' too...

best,

pat--

i asked th same question here about a year ago, for the intro to
our site (http://www.burningpress.org/gallery/gallery.html) ov the
same name... here's what i got (minus my elisions, sorry 'bout that):


Machine Made of Words:

   "To make two bald statements: There's nothing sentimental about a
    machine, and: A poem is a small (or large) machine made of
    words... Prose may carry a load of ill-defined matter like a ship.
    But poetry is the machine which drives it, pruned to a perfect
    economy. As in all machines its movement is intrinsic, undulant, a
    physical more than a literary character...
    When a man makes a poem, makes it, mind you, he takes words as
    he finds them interrelated about him and composes them--without
    distortion which would mar their exact significances--into an intense
    expression of his perceptions and ardors that they may constitue a
    revelation in the speech that he uses. It isn't what he says that
    counts as a work of art, it's what he makes."
                                --William Carlos Williams,
                                  from "Authors Introduction to The Wedge"


i've always liked that, machines being tools with which we do work...

Henry:  Many thanks for your last message.  Very likely there's an influen=
ce
from language's internal restraints, but the primary sonic determinants of=
 the
pitch/duration/voicing traces that I obtain are either sub-segmental -- th=
e
quasi-instant of "stress" in all its ill-defined mystery -- or supra-segme=
ntal
-- durations of pitch and voicing that often exceed the borders of syllabl=
es
and can on rare occasions weld almost 9/10ths of a line together.  One
favourite example of this, is Chaucer's "And bath=E8d every vein in swich
licour" which, in Middle English pronunciation, doesn't dislocate voicing =
or
pitch until "-cour", so that any syllabic effect, or "restraints" syncopat=
e
within an overall, continuous sounding.  Similarly, Wyatt's "So unwarely w=
as
never no man caught", which I've referred to, will not dislocate until
"caught" if a reader is sensitive to the possibilities of continuous voici=
ng
in the earlier part of the line.  This voicing possibility is perhaps a hi=
nt
of your restraints, but other readers (less sensitive, perhaps) don't alwa=
ys
profit from it and make an unnecessary intonation break which spoils the l=
ine
very slightly.  If you drone the voicing continuously and also undulate th=
e
pitch of "So unwarely was never no man" (making a "z" out of "was" to keep=
 the
voicing), you can create a sudden and tiny effect of the poet being "caugh=
t"
at the end of the line, when the voicing necessarily breaks to create the
transition from "n" to back-of-throat "c".  This slightly accentuates the
meaning and emotional significance of the line. But rather than "restraint=
s"
there, I prefer to speak of possibilities the language voicing "code" crea=
tes
for a performer to exploit.  That is, they are not so much "poetic
regularities" as possibilities exploited in similar ways by different
performers, whose interpretations roughly converge in that way.

Various modern poetries, turning perhaps against the lyric, may not be
approachable by such investigations as mine.  That's fine by me: I like al=
l
exploration in poetics, philosophy and, no doubt, political viewpoint.  I
would merely note that every sonic element I look at occurs in ordinary
conversation and prose as well as in poetry.  And as far as I know, no poe=
try
-- whether Chinese, Thai, Bengali, French, German, Sanskrit, or English ev=
en
in its anti-lyric or randomesque forms -- can be free of the following
factors: pitch, stress, duration, voicing, voice quality, loudness.  Even =
if
you say, "This poem is not for reading aloud", the mouth (it has been show=
n)
will make those premonitory muscular movements as though you were about to
read aloud.  Perhaps you could demonically train your subconscious not to =
act
that way: I don't know!  Anyway, those sonic factors, plus meaning and
emotional significance, are what I study.

I don't want to preoccupy listees as a whole with my obsessions.  But if y=
ou
were interested, I could send you photocopies of what these tunes look lik=
e.
Just e-mail me an ordinary mail address.  Within reason, that offer is als=
o
open to any other listees wanting to satisfy more than idle curiosity.

Best

Listafarians, apologies for the late posting of this, a posting probably
too late for you to cancel your garden parties, polo matches, or charity
work tomorrow at 5:15 when Kathleen Fraser will address the mob at the
Attic Club (or Bar or Pub?), just metres west of Mission on 24th St. I
David Bromige will take up part of the program.

I regret the tardiness of this instigation. Its been one of those weeks. A
fine one. What I need is a volunteer to help me with these items. Someone
whose intelligence I surely cannot afford. Ah well. I wont say "*see* you
there," because the Attic is a dark, dive bar where, it is rumored, there
are those who still smoke therein, flouting California law in the
transgressive spirit of Poetry, while remaining safely invisible. I envy
them.

PS Do you notice how many DJs say "see you next week" on the air? "To see"
bleeds, doesnt it? Are you "seeing" someone right now? See what I mean?  D.

Announcing a reading -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:


TONY LOPEZ

reading October 19, Monday, at 2pm

Montgomery College
Rockville Campus
Science West, Room 122
Manakee Street (not sure I am spelling the street right)
Rockville, Maryland

Tony Lopez was born in 1950 and grew up in Brixton, South London.  He began
working as a freelance on short stories for newspapers and magazines in the
1970s and published five crime and science fiction novels with New English
Library between 1973 and 1976, when he gave up fiction writing and returned to
school.  He attended the University of Essex (BA 1980) and Gonville & Caius
College, University of Cambridge (PhD 1986).  During the 1980s he was involved
in various performance art events, staged in Britain and Europe. He has
published many books and pamphlets of poetry, including Snapshots (1976),
Change (1977), The English Disease (1979), A Handful of British Birds (1982),
Abstract & Delicious (1983), A Theory of Surplus Labour (1990), Stress
Management (1994), and most recently Negative Equity and Other Poems (1995).
A selection of his poetry is included in the Picador anthology Conductors of
Chaos (1996) edited by Iain Sinclair.  He teaches in England at the University
of Plymouth.

from the poem "Non-Core Assets"

They took a shadow and laid it in the straw.
Let it be rough and ready to make a reality
Deft, restless and unpredictable.  Thus they rode
Through Norwich in every sort of fantastic dress.
Reason explained that good living was now over,
Time itself at hand.  Lights, lanterns and fires
Burning in the woods.  Damp air, shell-suit trousers,
Light blue sweatshirt, green padded jacket: the subject
Of this attack unknown.  If you have no wire,
Roll newspapers into spirals, tie the ends together
In white cloth and herring skins.  Thence souls in torment
Who do enter into these family customs
In schools, clubs, or any organisation.
Among the straw cut-out is something of the truth.

They are like straight unwinding roads that lead
Into eternity.  When we launch a car
We like to drop it.  Root nourishing shampoo:
Dolphins ascending a water staircase.
Big coat and grip, gondola wedding,
Big coat and away through Lombardy poplars.
I find we have plenty of opportunities
For listening to speech, yet few people take them:
We need practical ways of securing resonance.
Urizen is at home on the world wide web
Sending pulses of self-indulgent grief echo
To measure your file space without hiring new staff.
A stretched limo floats over a crimson sunset
I never knew he missed driving so much.

Confessions


I pulled the second trigger at the Kennedy assassination. It was me got
Shorty. I violated those kids. Them heterosexuals were mutilated by me,
the ones in Panama. I didn't know but I had the gun. And I gave Mrs.
Kennedy cancer, the kind that killed her. I ran two against three at
Belmont but skimmed off the bottom and got to win place. Got my semen on
her fur but what was she doing on the IRT. I pulled the second trigger at
the Martin Luther King assassination. Now I got your attention, you got to
believe me. It was me who done Brinks. Maybe you don't think I'm serious.
See, I'm dead serious. I wrote kike in Lewiston on the school ground
there. It makes a difference with a kid. You can look a kid in the eye.
Kids are honest. Did some swastikas too. But I set the explosives in the
truck. I don't need to explicate, you know what truck I mean. Look, I
don't have anything personal against them. But I don't need to eh. Was me
raped that tourist in Orlando, she looked at me funny. I don't get orders
I give them. I got no truck with punks. They'd set deadeye on you without
thinking but no control. Like that time in Larrabee, one of them's still
looking for his mama, other don't say nothin or maybe can't. You can't
tell cause I look just like you. Maybe a kid can tell. Maybe a kid is
dead.

I don't have any answers to the above questions, but I'll pipe up as a
reader.  I find Burns' writing (I don't know anything about his personality)
difficult, in the best sense of that word, and better in small doses (a few
poems at a time from -Shorter Poems-, for example).  I particularly take to
heart his complaint in -A Thing About Language- that many of the language
poets rarely use a noun that can't be found in -People- magazine.  His own
work is of course full of such nouns; there's an observational (even
phenomenological) closeless to much of his poetry that I value, even when I
don't know quite what it adds up to.  I don't know what to make of his
claims that his poems were written in complicated weighted metrics; I can't
read any such thing out of the poems, but, hey, I don't really understand
the variable foot either.

Odd note--he was quoted, a few mos. before his death, in either -Time- or
-Newsweek- as thinking, when he read the -Unibomber Manifesto- in the paper,
that its Kantian strains sounded a lot like his old Harvard classmate Ted
Kozinski (sp?).

I too would be interested in hearing about any plans to publish Burns' work
posthumously.

Oh, while I'm here, could someone tell me how to get in touch (by phone or
e-mail) w/ Coffee House Press?  Backchannel fine.

Oh, oh: Anyone read the David Lehman book on JA/FOH/KK/JS?

I dip into Burns every once in a while, and think he's A-1.  I recently
read William Sylvester's piece on Burns's *Freud and Picasso* (or
vice-versa) in *House Organ* and found it absorbing reading.  Will be
mentioning it, briefly, in my next column for *Small Press Review*.  As
for the Lehman book about what Lehman with incredible fatuousness titles
*The Last Avant- Garde*, I haven't read it but HAVE read a review of it
in *The New Criterion* by John Simon, the only widely-published poetry
critic in this country more obtuse and behind-the-times than Lehman.
Quite a laugh.

I thought Lehman's book was pretty good for what it was meant to be, and
should help to introduce those writers to a broader audience.  I know
some people don't believe that is a noble goal, and I agree that its
alright if someone doesn't want to read poetry. But I also like to share
or propagandize on behalf of art & literature & music (and food and
travel and other pleasures of peace) that I have enjoyed, so I think its
worth trying.  It's a great book for a high school senior or college
freshman interested in poetry.

Does anyone object to Lehman's reading of the the poems or poets?  I
suppose someone might object to his downplaying of O'Hara's sexuality
(in an attempt to rebalance after the Gooch biography), but of course
O'Hara's poetry has delighted plenty of non-homosexuals.

Lehman emphasizes the pleasure that the NY school poets found and took
in writing and reading and in art and in life, and, being old fashioned,
I think those are good things.

Is it possible that someone on the list will disagree with me?

For what it's worth, I expect to enjoy the Lehman book on the New York
school poets--as I enjoyed the Gooch book on O'Hara.  The problem with
books like Lehman's, and with his "Best Poems" anthologies, is not that
they are particularly stupid but that they ignore so much that is far
better than what they are about or contain.  Why write about four
mediocrities who were tepidly "experimental" in the manners of Eliot
and Williams (paraphraxis and super-demotic diction) some FORTY years or
so ago when there are SEVERAL REAL avant-gardes going on in poetry RIGHT
NOW that could use a book about them?

Elizabeth,  as lisa says "she didn't denounce so much as renounce
poetry, as people have pointed out in various articles.  but she did not
repudiate her old work. "  She does not regret her own work but rather
acknowledges the inherent flaws in poetry itself. In the back of
collected poems there is an interview with her which clarifies the
matter. I would not consider the time she spent writing poetry to be a
particularly long time expecially by comparision to the nearly 50 years
she spent mounting her opposition.

Berman's piece was a pleasure, but a limited one.  Information and
analysis were all derived from David Reynold's "Walt Whiteman's America,"
a fine historicizing (though, in terms of poetry, only narrowly
interpreted) cultural biography of the all-time champ.  Berman's piece
could have used a little tip of the hat to its source -- it smacked too
much of book report or a hash job (as if no one would notice).  Still, it
was good to see it -- and the fact that such an outrageous poet remains
the national poet (as Clinton would testify) is a wonderful, comforting
thought.  However, in terms of both Reynold and Berman, I would still like
to see more about the poems themselves, particularly the still-radical
and disturbing democratic/totalitarian eruption of the 1855 edition.

Been absent for a few days. Wanted to report on a reading I was at in
Portsmouth Ohio at Teeny's, third thursday of each month. The main
reader was Tom Bridwell who read ten pieces from a new book_Notes from
the Cistern_. No publisher yet. The book is a massive serial work, 110
pages (after 56 were discarded), incredibly dense material written in a
six month period holed up in Virginia. Reoccuring themes of
construction, food, Beckett, drinking, eating, drugs, roadkills,
Wittgenstein, Levi-Strauss, a human joint maker, sex, texts, properly
prepared roadkills, building a building, surfaces, mixes thereof and
dozens of others done primarily in prose with a scarcity of poems
interspersing. I can't find small areas to quote that I am satified with
but here goes:

"Lay the knots open. Tension keeps the cords taut, the ends fall away
soon enough. Sense is seldom unveiled. Were She standing before you,
naked, the lateness of the hour or some things pressing would preclude
the sight. It bears repeating."

"I've signed away everything that was mine. I'm as uncomfortable as I
can be. But I do, by god, twitch. If this is a test, for those of you
with your notebooks, be clear about that: he did twitch. "
His intensity frightened the hell out of two tables of old ladies near
the front. Hell, his reading scared everyone there which is amazing
considering that, except for a few minor exceptions, it was lacking
emotional changes in timber and tone.

Not including the folks who had to listen out in the street, the
audience inside was counted at 67 including Joe Napora, Bob Fox, Darren
Baker, Ralph LaCharity, Brian Richards and myself.

Non-featured readers included Ralph LaCharity who bears similarities to
Chuck Stein but it's a lot more phonetically complicated.  He is a
phenomenal reader & has this set of pieces where he says "I am going to
do a poem and if I do it correctly you will hear TWO languages at the
same time. The first will be a vernacular of English from south
California. The second you will hear is modern Greek." Then he pulls it
off. Its amazing. Heads up Boston folks he is hitting all the open mike
readings out there starting the 24th of this month.

I read a few and was amazed at how the waitstaff was chastizing patrons
for not being silent during the readings, especially when Ralph was
reading.

Brian Richards ended the reading with a phenomenal piece, _Talking at
Teeny's_ I loved the lines "What may be said is a piton in the face / of
Mount Nonsense, part of a specific problem"  and ends with:

Do you like sports? Then be one. Buy me a drink.
Buy everyone a drink; the hostess needs the business.
Give her the business. Give us all time to think
about it over a fresh one: cool.

And the merriment went long into the night after and after, got home
saturday.

Be well

I saw the American version in a bookstore on Friday.  The title is one
word, begins with a W., very Hughesian.  Published in the States, I
think, by FSG.

        As promised, a report of sorts on the conference here at the
University of Iowa last week, on Composition & Improvisation, featuring
Lyn Hejinian, Clark Coolidge, Rova Saxophone Qrt., and painter Tom Soule.
I had the pleasure of meeting other list members who'd made the trip to
attend some of the events & it's my hope that they will add to this
"report"  --  substantiate it . . .
        The first conference consisted of poets, with poetry workshop
students mostly in attendance.  Coolidge recounted some anecdotes re: the
improvisatory nature of the NYSchool scene of which he was part, saying it
was considered polite to edit and/or amend the work (inevitably) in
progress laying out or sitting in the typewriter at parties.  Making
reference, obviously, to the emphasis on process over product, and citing
the term "work" as preferred over "poem", &tc.  He read, at the request of
Marvin Bell, work from _The Rova Improvisations_
        Lyn Hejinian asserted from the offset, improvisation as "entirely
in the medium of referral," "in time," and for her purposes always with
reference to the page (prior works/the other...).  When improvising one
seeks
resistence, one "volunteers to doubt", one engages correspondence  --
Jorie Graham asked how this is different than the work "we" do everyday,
Hejinian responding, with something to the effect of, responding to
Hopkins, say, is not improv. by virtue that Hopkins safely has no
response, himself.
        This led to discussion of improvisatory strategies, which Rova
picked up on the next day.  Using the example of a new work-in-progress
entitled "Radar", the four Rovas discussed the hand signals or cues that
compose the piece.  That is, hand signals (which any one of the band
members may offer up at any time) represent improvisatory strategies which
they have titled accordingly, "micro-tonal groan", "machine sounds", "the
wave" [this one just like the auditorium game, in their case passing a
riff along to the edge of the horseshoe/mixing that up/sending it back] .
. .  Thus, the Rovas perform a "Radar", will one day record some "Radars"
--  indeed, their encore at the concert Friday night consisted of two
"Radars"
        Coolidge and Hejinain read Thursday night.  Hejinian began with a
long (specially edited version) of "A Border Comedy"  --  a piece she had
earlier explained arose out of improvisatory experiments conducted with
the poet Jack Collum (sp?).  W/ "A Border Comedy", she used forgetfulness
as a correspondent, writing several lines, setting aside, later adding
more lines;  she improvised with herself.  Coolidge read many shorter
pieces, highly comical["poets go ape shit when they see themselves
coming"], employing neologistic verbs that inevitably gave
the impression that someone was whispering to you while chewing on
potatoes chips, and you were to gather what you could . . . what could a
term such as "rurtch" mean?  Besides Baraka, these are two of the best
readers I have come across.
        Unfortunately, I missed Tom Soule's presentation on 20th Cent..
Painting Aspiring to Music . . . anyone there for this?
        The gist of the rest of the proceedings, however, was in the
perhaps impossible task of delineating between composition and
improvisation.

OK, OK, I'm simply playing the role of questioner, having only read 3 of her
books and only dipped into the Progress of, and not used to being a lecturer

I am wondering if the person(s) who mentioned THE WORD WOMAN could please
say more about it.  Then maybe I'll try my hand.

Just a reminder to those of you in the Northern California area:

Other Minds opens its 5th anniversary season this coming week with concerts
on Wednesday and Thursday, Oct 21 and 22, of the Bang on a Can All-Stars in

I hope you will join us for an enjoyable two evenings and support this
effort of Other Minds with your ticket purchases.  Please plan to attend
both evenings if possible.  They will be quite different in the first half,
with Brian Eno's 40-min. Music for Airports comprising the entire second
half both nights, giving you a chance to memorize the piece or simply orbit
inside it.

  I suggested to someone who was reviewing the book that he should
  review it alongside of Charles North's new book of essays/reviews
  from Hanging Loose press, as complementary (and also as a book which
  will not get as much "play" because of the press, and the lack of
  a "jarring" media-goading title)--becsue Lehman's idea of the NYS
  is as reductive as the anti-Ashberians'--on the other hand--
  idea of it is (it's great to see him include Connie Deanovich and
  Tom Breidenbach, for instance, in his list of younger "NY School"
  types---but to exclude Notley and Mayer?). Anyway, it seems this
  person is taking my advice, and I will let you know if and when his
  review is published....

I'm hoping someone out there can help me with a minor point about NY history.

When did the Ear Inn and/or St. Marks begin?

I have a hunch that it was sometime after 1968.  Anyone that can help me with
firmer dates maybe should just back channel me.

Thanks in advance.

        Apropos of Pierre's "good news" last week about Nigeria's laureate
returning home, I can't remember being so surprised and delighted at any
international news as the headline this weekend that Pinochet has gotten
arrested and detained by the British and Spanish authorities.

        25 years later . . . "justice"? Probably not. But still, it tastes
sweet.

        A few notes on other topics: the thread between Gary Sullivan and
Stephen Cope on Spicer and the (perhaps continuing) Laura R. Jackson
discussion have both been really interesting, and I hope the principals
continue to contribute. (Perhaps we could have a poem of hers to look at? I
don't have her poems here, but what about the short one that begins, I
think, "the map of places passes / the reality of paper tears")

        On Friday Aldon said:

         "LRJ still believed that there was "truth," but that it couldn't be
communicated through poetry-My own sense is that "truth" only exists as a
relationship among statements, and is thus as readily available in poetry as
anywhere else-

        I await her judgement-"

        And I think this absolutist tone, as it's been called in the last
week or so, is very much the issue. The idea of someone renouncing poetry as
"insufficient" should be enough to get the attention of any practitioner,
which was my reason for checking out The Telling many years ago. But right
after Aldon's post above came the latest news from the Blake website (for
which I thank Matt Kirschenbaum PROFUSELY -- what lovely images!), which got
me, between innings this weekend, to taking him off the shelf. And this is
what he says to Ms. Jackson:

        "No man can think write or speak from his heart, but he must intend
truth. Thus all sects of Philosophy are from the Poetic Genius adapted to
the weaknesses of every individual"

        Sometimes you gotta talk across centuries to make any sense. This,
for instance, is Blake's comment on the  Bill, Monica and Ken story:

        "Mutual forgiveness of each Vice
        Such are the Gates of Paradise
        Against the Accusers chief desire
        Who walkd among the Stones of Fire"

        That little ditty from "For the Sexes" ends with an epilogue called
"To the Accuser who is The God of This World" -- I think someone should send
it to the Special Prosecutor . . . ya know, some of Blake looks just like
lang po . . .

Is this possible? Two nights ago I dreamed that I was standing at a counter

yes, yes, yes -- it may only be shabby revenge, but I do hope Pinochet
celebrates his 110th birthday in a spanish jail. It wld at least be symbolic
justice, even if it cannot  make up for the past sufferings of the people of
Chile or for the still virulent heritage of Pinochet. Now how about some
country doing the same to the CIA goons who set up the coup that brought him to
power? -- Pierre

News just in that the French poet Pierre Martory died last week. A very
secretive poet, he was not well-known in France, but was championed in
this country by his great friend John Ashbery who also translated him
brilliantly -- two volumes at least, tho I don't know if they are still
in print: _Every Question but One_ and _The Landscape is Behind the
Door_. In 1997 Alyscamps/Sheep Meadow published a selected poems in
French, called _Veilleur de Jours_.

I'm hoping one of you knowledge folks out there in this world of wires
and such can help me. I'm not asking for ropes or pulleys at this point,
but just advice.    A project: I write potry inspired by  19th century
engineering  and medical texts. The idea being to bring out the allure
and beauty contained within these mechanisms.

What I'm a-wonderin', as they say, is or are:
                Anyone interested in this type of project?

below are a few examples of what I'm speaking:

I saw some tv the other night - rare for me - of a lion jumping on a
hyena... absolute stillness for a moment or two and then up gets the hyena
and pushes the lion away (I think it was a hyena, I came into this
programme: 4 legs and a head)

And this is a British lion. Unfortunately. Stone throughout and pale with
bird droppings

I too am very excited that Pinochet has been captured. If it just gives him
indigestion for a while, that's something. But now that the euphoria has
passed, I am finding it harder and harder to imagine that he will ever stand
trial in Spain. If only because those goons wouldn't like it.... Talking of
which, which country breaking UN resolutions do you think the free countries
of the world will threaten to bomb next?

Paul Berman for years has functioned (as author, pundit, frequent Village
Voice presence) as one of those especially revolting right-wing "leftists"
...whose main take on life and history is that virtually all
revolutionaries are dups of some clique or their own bloody-minded
passions..And so an inert mainstream liberalism is true responsible left
politix.  Has also usually been profoundly haughty and distasteful in
his manner of delivering this pitiable insight.

So, i was mildly pleased yesterday to find that he'd written something i
found diverting and enjoyable for a few minutes.

On specifically poetic matters, his piece was more than a little weird:
Berman apparently believes that **all** eroticism and sexual elements in
Leaves of Grass are mystic, and refer to union with God--that WW is never
concerned with actual human eros.  The bizzare quality of this belief was
heightened, in the Times piece, by his evident sense that it was a
perfectly uncontroversial claim....

That sounds like a great idea to me.....How about the USA doing it
(..gonna haveta change a few things around first, of course..)

By the way the NY Times article on Sunday announcing Pinochet's arrest
cited the number of people murdered in the coup boodbath as **3,000**

Now, i know that 1. the number had (even apart from US apologists) gotten
revised downward somewhat, from what we believed it to be in the mid-70s;
and 2. the NYT is a propaganda sheet, and to put it mildly its "truth
value" is highly limited.

But even so, from what i know the number of 3 thousand is just a tad
insanely *low*....

A parable for poets on the power of words and symbolic gestures: i had a
friend in college who had (as a high school student) spent a year living
in Chile as part of an exchange program.  The family she stayed with were
fascists.  (This didn't bother her that much as she wasn't yet aware enuff
of things to really realize it..and politix didn't come up much.)  But
they did something quietly reminiscent of Orwell's 1984:  whenever
Pinochet gave a speech on TV they would (in the privacy of their own
living room, no one there but this one family) **stand up** to express
their respect and reverence.

Though as Pierre hints at Pinochet was only the blunt instrument of
murder and repression. Even the clique of powerful Chilean military
officials and businessmen thought Pinochet too soft for the job.
Initially the gang of U.S. Corporations and the State Dept. thought he
would not have the resolve to eliminate the people necessary while
making the country safe for U.S. capital. He proved them wrong. As
Eduardo Galeano said, "People were imprisoned so that markets could be
free."
I'd like to add Milton Friedman and the Chicago School to the wish list
of fat cats behind bars as well as Kissinger, several dozen U.S.
executives who are still alive from that period and another two dozen or
so State Department officials not to mention the economic, political and
military power base in Chile who, probably again with U.S. money, have
launched the current campaign to free Pinochet. And while were at it
some N. Y. Times and Washington Post reporters have some shit to answer
for. Of course, anyone who has studied U.S. foreign policy from its
inception could only conclude that it is a continuing criminal
enterprise.
But, of course, coming from a poet this is all wind. Today, I read that
one of the individuals behind the current push here in Congress to give
a coalition of Iraqi resistance 97 million dollars is none other than
former CIA-Iran-contra figure, Duane 'Dewey' Clarridge. Looks like
Dewey's done landed on his feet or more accurately enhanced his resume
by showing a willingness to engage in blatantly criminal and
unconstitutional behavior while at the same time distancing himself from
the grossly indiscreet career liar and radio persoanlity, Oliver North.
Couple that with Cuban exile and long time CIA contract agent, Louis
Posada Carilles' public admission that he was behind a series of
bombings in Havana in the mid-nineties and the State Department's lack
of interest and you can gauge just how low on the pecking order a stooge
like Pinochet is. Still there is that symbolic thrill at seeing the
bastard locked up.
You all may remember Posada Carilles. He was convicted in a Venezuelan
court of planning the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner which killed all
73 people aboard including the Cuban fencing team. Posada Carilles later
escaped from a Venezuelan prison with CIA-State Dept. connivance and
showed up working for the CIA's station chief in El Salvador, Felix
Rodriguez, helping to resupply the contras from Ilapango Air Force Base
outside of San Salvador. Podada Carilles demonstrates how steadfastly
the U.S. State Department protects its terrorist. After all, Pinochet
murdered and imprisoned more U.S. citizens than those of Spain and
England combined.---Carlo Parcelli

pamphlet, forget the title off hand, which is one of the better items to
come my way in some time.  Go on & subscribe.

Uh, I never said I was trying to defend him.  You've made the mistake of
assuming that 'cause I've read Adorno & am willing to take some time to
explain his positions when they've been extremely oversimplified that I'm a
supporter of these positions.

& "Simply" is probably EXACTLY the wrong word to describe any aspect of
Adorno's thought.  Adorno's complaints about jazz are neither simple-, or
single-minded; they're consistent with his relatively complicated views on
contemporary music in general. You may think these are dumb ideas, but they
just come from a very different world from the one you live in.

Adorno's model of culture is Marxist & progressive: historic, political, &
cultural processes evolve together, echoing and re-inforcing each other.
For him, just as Mahler grew out of Beethoven, the next step was clearly
serial music.  Adorno's response to non-serial modernist music such as
Stravinsky's was that it was regressive, an attempt to delay the next
historical phase of musical culture. For supposedly cultured people to
ignore, denounce, etc. the next historically inevitable step in music was,
to his way of thinking, counter-productive.

His critique is also related to the overall critique of what the
Frankfurters called the culture industry:  radio, audio recordings, film,
photography.  For Adorno what the mechanisms of the culture industry did
was take control of culture away from the artists and audience & put it
into the hands of middle men, who didn't care or know much about the art
being presented.

Where there had been once people actively making their own music, whether
it was "classical", "folk" or some other "original" music, there was now a
pop music industry with entertainers who's work was presented in ways that
were not possible before - Bing Crosby was no longer just a performer in
Spokane, Bob Wills was no longer just a performer from Texas, Mae West was
no longer a performer from wherever she was from, pop performers could now
have a national & international presence through broadcasts & films that
belied any rootedness in time or place. The links between the historic
processes of civilization as a whole and the historic processes of music &
the other arts had been  disrupted for commercial purposes.  You could have
music in your home anytime you wished but it was music selected, or
created, to be easily palatable, without participating in a music culture.

Because the new media were able to represent works outside of real time and
space, they transformed popular culture from a local phenomena, what people
did in their neighborhoods, to a mass event unparalleled in earlier times,
partly because it was larger than other events, and partly because it had
been separated from whatever roots it had in a real locale, a real
community practice.

For Adorno, jazz was one more art form removed from it's cultural milieu,
turned into a commercial product for & by the media.  For him, the content
or lack thereof was irrelevant to this fact. Hence his notion that bebop
was "good bad music" - it was "better" than what had come before, but still
flawed by the manipulations of the culture industry to move more units of
product, as well as being flawed by not being involved in the specific
historic processes he saw as the next step in musical history.

Adorno somewhere writes that everytime he saw a movie he felt it made him
stupider & less moral, & this is typical of his response to what were then
the new media: it tended to cheapen the content either by ignoring its
potential import (by programming virtually anything to fill time); by
ignoring its cultural sources (all music is "ours" cause we can own the
records) or by watering it down (as in the case of, say, most film
adaptations of literature).

As before, I refer folks to the recent books by Robert Witkin & M Paddison
on Adorno & music for a more detailed look at these issues. These books
both make a better case for Adorno than I have, but don't assume as much
knowledge of classical music as Adorno's own writings do.

I'm not sure how much time I'll have to respond to response to this, but I
thought I shouldn't leave this hanging (though given how fast the thread
died down, maybe I should have).

Bests,

Thanks to Pierre and Carlo for responding to the Pinochet news yesterday. It
does, of course (before anyone asks) have "something to do with poetics." As
Carlo says, echoing Pierre, "Still there is that symbolic thrill at seeing
the bastard locked up" -- and we're all (I think) involved in a symbolic
enterprise, no matter how we interpret that word.

Carlo also said:

" . . . anyone who has studied U.S. foreign policy from its
inception could only conclude that it is a continuing criminal
enterprise. But, of course, coming from a poet this is all wind. . . ."

Perhaps, perhaps not. I've really liked two or three recent apocalyptic
posts from Alan Sondheim, revealing an acute grasp of social complexity and
tragedy. But this brings to mind a post from Henry five days ago, which many
may have ignored because, you know, it was Henry . . .

 "But my point was
to suggest some issues that rarely get much focus on this "innovative" list.
Such as the role of the poet as individual "social actor" or historical
witness.  In a literary market economy where the money lies in mysteries,
thrillers, biographies, self-help books, and the rest of the mountain of
conventional self-adjuster-release mechanisms, it's become an assumption
that innovative or alternative poetries should just set up their own
alternative
networks and produce produce produce and publish publish publish and promot
promote promote in ways that simply mirror the commercial sector. (This
sounds a bit like Herb's recent post about Adorno). Whatever happened to the
poet's role as political intepreter or exemplar?  As outcast or participant
in real events and political issues?  I am not thinking so much of the "poet
in prison" paradigm of various tyrannies, but of Whitman's example of the
poet who insinuates him or herself into larger historical dramas (nursing
the Civil War wounded), or even more pertinent, of the poet who makes the
writing process consciously related to or dependent on an existential
situation - the poet as reporter (can't think of an example offhand).
Another aspect of this is the question of value & production - how do you
compare the enormous oeuvres of contemporary poets with someone like
Vallejo, for example - whose poetry is of great interest precisely because
of the collision between creative innovation and existential (poor, emigre,
exile, embattled) reality that is expressed throughout.  What is precious
about poetry if it simply mimics the mass commercial popularity & success
contest - if it declines to "reach into the wound & heal it" as Mandelstam
puts it (Slate Ode)?"

There have been many threads on the List about such potentials for poetry.
It's an ambition, I think, that is sometimes forgotten (and sometimes not
even articulated).

Finally, here's the poem by Laura Riding I mentioned yesterday.

The Map of Places

The map of places passes.
The reality of paper tears.
Land and water where they are
Are only where they were
When words read _here_ and _here_
Before ships happened there.

Now on naked names feet stand,
No geographies in the hand,
And paper reads anciently,
And ships at sea
Turn round and round.
All is known, all is found.
Death meets itself everywhere.
Holes in maps look through to nowhere.
______________________________________________________________
Although the level of abstraction, as Marjorie mentioned, is certainly high,
I find this poem rather amazing -- and spooky! Would love to know what
others thought.

Poetry and the appeals process --

This morning's news carries a story of a federal appeals court's decision
regarding the extent of liability public schools may bear for failure to
respond to student complaints of racial "slurs."  The decision also
rejected a claim that a school could be sued for requiring the reading of
_Huckleberry Finn_ and "A Rose for Emily."

I'm not so much interested in that part of the case as I am in something
that happens in the court's published opinion.  The judges ruled, as they
should, that a court ban of such books would violate the 1st Amendment, but
they went on to argue that a contrary ruling might make "an extremely
wide--if not unlimited--range of literary products" [yes, they did use the
word "products"] vulnerable to similar actions.  They wrote that "White
plaintiffs could seek to remove books by Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and
other prominent black authors on the ground that they portray Caucasians in
a derogatory fashion;"

What's of interest to me in this sentence is a curious but common bit of
slippage.  As we move from the works at issue in the case to speculation
about possible offenses to white people, suddenly we are discussing
"derogatory" portrayals rather than expressions of racism.  Note also that
there appears to be a presupposition of equivalence between "negative" and
"derogatory."  These judges appear to be incapable of making a distinction
of any sort between characterizations in which somebody is derogated
_because_ of their race, and negative prtrayals of individuals quite apart
from their race.  (For example, would we call descriptions of unsavory
English characters in Dickens derogratory portrayals of white people?)
This has the effect of emptying out legitimate concerns about racism in
literature (though I oppose the solutions sought by the bringers of the
case) and reducing them to the old "negative imagery" debate -- a debate
that has considerably more merit than readers might gather from this
opinion --  again, it's not the outcome of the case that interests me here,
but the presuppositions and rhetorical movements within the opinion.

The judges go on to say that "Jews might try to impose civil liability for
the teaching of Shakespeare and of more modern English poets where writings
exhibit a similar anti-Semitic strain.  Female students could attempt to
make a case for damages for the assignment of the works of Tenessee
Williams, Hemingway or Freud, and male students for the writings of Andrea
Dworkin or Margaret Atwood."

There's entirely too much to take on in that, but please note the general
ref. to "more modern English poets" as opposed to the specificity of the
other examples!

Anyway, as a defender of the teaching of ol Huck, I have always wondered
what sort of reaction might be expected by a teacher who brought into class
literary works with clearly racist remarks about white people and
approached the work with the attitudes commonly used in class-room
discussions of Twain --

and here's my question -- has anyone out there ever taught, or been taught,
literary works that are clearly racist against white people.  (and again, I
DO NOT mean simply a negative description of somebody who is white, but an
expression of ideological racism)???  If so, how did the discussion go?  I
have tried on a few occasions to teach some racist poetry from the late
60s, and I can tell you that the fire storm that resulted in the class was
not something I'd want to repeat soon -- The same students who earlier told
me that cummings was being subtly antiracist found no similar irony in the
poems we were discussing.

not racist against whites, but...
Several years ago, I wrote a thesis on anti-Semitism in the media, and my
professor had asked me to discuss it with the class. Of course, I talked
about the airing of the "Hey Jew boy" poem over the radio in the late
60's--there were a lot of hushes and "ohmigods" in the lecture hall. After
the class ended, the tension was most uncomfortable. I talked with a few
of the black students later, and they were irked--it was as if by reading
a racist poem (by a 9-year-old boy!), I had betrayed the black students.
"Now all the Jews are going to think we all think this way," was a common
complaint. I tried to convince them otherwise; this was an example of
anti-semitism in the media, guys, we talked about Henry Ford,
too--unfortunately, the black students were right. No great strides were
made in the field of black/Jewish relations that semester. :)
I've also noticed that even reading Audre Lorde and Ntozake Shange in
classes, though they're not blatantly racist, causes white students to
feel discrimination. Or so they say. I don't think discriminated is the
right word, I think what they really mean is that they're isolated.

Shana brings up an additional issue, which we've spoken of briefly on the
list from time to time -- I've taught at historically black colleges,
historically white colleges,,, have taught much of the same materials in
each institution --

one of the greatest shocks of my early career (OK, so I'm hopelsessly
naive) was the discovery that many white students seem to take any
discussion of the history of slavery as an attack upon them --

that this remains an active sentiment in our society was shown by the
short-lived recent debate about a possible national "apology" for slavery
-- the letters to the editors columns of the American press immediately
filled with some of the most vehement (and ignorant) responses I've ever
seen -- one letter writer in Colordao went so far as to make the old
"positive good" argument (that is, that black Americans are so much better
off for having been brought here that they should be thankful for their
deliverance from Africa) --

but to return to your example -- what does it say about us that one poem by
a school child has been better known lo these past three decades than any
anti-antisemitic poem by anybody -- (and the other question I keep coming
back to, in whose interests is it for African-Americans and
Jewish-Americans to think they are each other's worst enemies?) --

Another issue at stake in the banning o' Twain might be that it is not
only an attempt to suppress proliferation of racist representations, but
that it is an attempt to cleanse high school classes of all historical
evidence of racism among our "respected" authors.  Or alternatively. . .
since people probably don't complain about such things in history
classes, it suggests something about people's peculiar understanding of
what "literature" is, that "high culture" protects us some how from bad
ideas.  Given these concerns, has anyone ever taught a class on "race"
and "gender" that focused on historically popular texts that were
explicitly racist but never made the cut for late 19th century cannons
because of their unpopular representations?

While everyone's dissing Twain, maybe someone should put together a
proposal to ban books that are written about cozy New England
communities that had slaves, but within which slaves never appear.

Just a thought.

Damn, what a hick, sending private notes to you all...

Well, not wanting to waste cyberspace, I'll bore you with some other
arcane 'multiple-thoughts-in-one-post.' Herb's post this morning on
Adorno and Jazz was very impressive, thoughtful and thorough. I
appreciate how he is able to articulate his views of Adorno's position
on Jazz without reducing that contradictory and difficult writer's prose
to some kind of good/bad dichotomy. And what got into A.L. Nielson
today? disturbing the List with that racial gibberygabook? I can't think
of any books I've read that would be considered prejudiced against
whites. The chances of those books being published, anyway, are slim,
since the publishing powers that be are, predominantly white. The only
exception I can think of might be Chester Himes, who did address racial
issues directly in many of his books, including Plan B, (published,
ironically enough, by the University of Mississippi), which is about a
race war in America. (He's another African-American writer who lived in
France). But I'd be hard pressed to call his works racist in the way
we've come to think of that term. I think he was justifiably pissed, but
not ideologically prejudiced against whites. I think his novels would be
difficult to teach, however, because he raises a lot of unpleasant
business, issues especially difficult for whites to address. I'm white,
and have taken part in many conversations about race, and I know I get
defensive, at times, about issues around it. I think it feels
threatening to discuss race because, as Adorno would say, we (whites
here) are implicated in that power structure that benefited from slavery
and exploited emancipation. Racial divisions are deep in the blood,
however cliched you might think it sounds. The intellectual responses to
race are good for bridging the genetic maelstrom, but my feelings, my
responses, if addressed forthright, in the past, have been defensive,
ending in an anger that feels engendered by misunderstandings. I think
the more engaged one becomes in a conversation re: race, the deeper into
the body the words go. And once you're in the body, look out, because
there are many years living there, I've discovered.

Well, I didn't mean to say all that... But what Aldon brought up is
important, and I thought it should be addressed with, if not some solid
examples and rigorous comments, at least an impression of my emotional
responses to racial discussions. It's touchy business though, I must
confess, because what you know dissolves quickly in the wake of what you
feel. This has been my experience anyway.

Are we at the point that teaching a work is equivalent to endorsing
everything in it, or necessitates an insurance policy against anything
potentially offensive therein? The weirdness of this logic also applies to
the idea that by excluding a given work in course we are stigmatizing it
in some awful way. No matter how encylopedic a course is it will always
exclude more than it can take in.

Sartre said it was impossible to write a good work of literature that was
racist or colonialist (I am paraphrasing forgive the inaccuracy of my
memory). The logic is that literature is intrinsically on the side of
human liberation. It's an argument that I don't hear much anymore--the
contemporary equivalent is that the *study or *teaching of literature has
to further human liberation.  The same argument but once removed.

Twain did not set out to write racist tracts; but racist tracts, insofar
as they are taught, will probably taught as such, with the issue of race
at the forefront.

There is the famous "literary nullification" doctrine:  if the work is
great literature, then any anti-semitism, racism, etc... is automatically
transcended. Pound's anti-semitism only *looks like anti-semitism, it is
really something else.  This is self-evidently ridiculous and leads to
much tortured reasoning.  Yet the idea that any one of us might be sued
for teaching The Cantos makes me shudder... For that matter all works of
literature written in the past will come up short when measured against
contemporary sensibilities.

Are you suggesting that Huck Finn is a racist tract or could even be taught

 No, that's not what I meant, and I apologize from my clumsy expression
 of my thought.  I meant to distinguish it from such. Is it racist?  Is
 Uncle Tom's Cabin racist?  Depends what you want that word to mean, I
 suppose.

Could it (HF) be taught as such?  I hope not, but there is the tendency
now to take whatever in a work is closest to contemporary political
concerns and make this theme the interpretive key to the work as a whole.
Thus Huck Finn would be "about" race, as the vulgar expression has it (I
hate that "about"). This is the other extreme from the "nullification"
hypothesis that claims that what appears to be racist cannot be so.

For Aldon's original question:  there was an article in the M/MLA Journal,
a few issues ago, about whiteness.  The author, a white woman if I am not
remembering wrong, describes some student responses to contemporary
African American poems. For me the essay was too much the "look how
defensive my white students are" genre, a close cousin of the "my male
colleague told me to study Milton" genre of critical essay.  The game
seems to be one of provoking defensive reactions from barely literate
students, then criticizing their defensiveness in print. All the same, it
might be worth looking at.

Aldon has raised all sorts of points, but I'd like to address the Huck
Finn angle.  Yes, the novel has been regarded as racist, particularly
because of the use of "nigger," but also because of the employment of
minstrel-coloquys (such as the dialogue on French).  For these reasons
some have tried to ban the book or prevent it from being used as required
high school reading.  I teach the book on the university level, and I get
reports from Stanford students of how the book is taught in high school --
and from these reports I wouldn't be too unhappy if the book was taken off
the required reading list, mainly because so many (though, of course,
not all) high school teachers seem to be incompetent or teaching the book
without any eye towards understanding its dark satire of racial relations
or why anyone would be uncomfortable.  In addition to reports of racial
blindness, I have received more disturbing accounts of out and out racist
abuse.  It's not the novel, it's not Twain, it's everything about this
country that Twain was so in touch with that presents the problem --
particularly for high school students (and teachers) who often are not
equiped to perceive the layers of irony (remember Pudd'nhead Wilson: the
town could not get his joke, could not perceive irony, but in the end
Puddn'head, the smartest man in town, couldn't perceive the irony of two
white people, one deemed a slave and the other deemed free).  To decide
whether or not something should be on the curiculum for high school
students is not censorship -- but if it is on the curiculum it must be
taught with the minimum of finese.  The horror stories are awful -- and
this goes beyond typical mediocrity. Gerald Graff has produced an edition
of Huck Finn that contains critical essays that present all the
controversies about the book -- all within Graff's theory of bringing the
controversies to the classroom.  This helps.  By ,the time I've finished
teaching the book students have an altogether different take on the racial
dynamics: there may 19th century stereotypes about black people embedded
in Twain's representation of Jim, but what is truly shocking is how
disgusting the white people are.  From Pap, to the King and the Duke, to
the Tom Sawyer -- everyone except Huck (who is simply naive, on the
fringe, and not especially enlightened) is blinded, warped, perverted by
racism.  So, if you want to teach an "anti-white" text, try Huck Finn: if
the racial blinders are truly off, the classroom will be thrown into an
uproar.  This is not to minimize what Aldon is trying to say: the tendency
is to accept or wink at or downplay the racist or anti-semitic in
"classics," but try to have something that smacks of "anti-white" or in
other ways challenging racial hierarchies and all hell breaks out. For
example, I've used "Mambo Mouth" by John Leguizamo in my class -- try the
final performance on Latino-Japanese cross-over for a little nervous
energy.

I think this is a great insight, that white people sometimes feel angry &
"discriminated against" when they feel isolated racially. I take this as proof
positive of their/our privileged position and it reminds me of a white man in one
of my classes at grad school (who, incidentally, didn't think using the word
"nigger" in his poetry was any big deal). One day he came in with a tale of being
what he called the "only grain of salt" on the subway into class. He was, I
think, feeling discriminated against because he felt *awkward*.

I'm tempted to say that I wish classes *would* make white students feel
discriminated against, just so they could get a taste, albeit a very mild one,
all told.

I haven't read Huck Finn in 23 years, and I didn't read it until college.
But when I did read it, I thought its critique of racism was obvious. So I
guess I'm amazed that high school teachers can't deal with it this way. I
have children in elementary school, and I actually have had a lot of
respect for their teachers so far (through 4th grade, in public schools
first in Minneapolis, now in Tucson). I can only hope that when they are in
high school they have teachers who are willing and capable of teaching such
works as Huck Finn. The current conversation is truly frightening to me.

This may be beyond the bounds for a poetics list. A biog piece of the
problem is the tenuous connection between students and teachers in HS
because the kids move every 45 minutes. This means that teachers can't
expand and contract subject-areas, or overlap them (say history and english
while reading Huck) depending upon the needs of the moment.

Just to mention here Jacques Attali's NOISE: THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF MUSIC
as a book which offers a kind of updated (and perhaps more enlightened)

ok, few items:

about twain, i'll just say it:  it would take a staunch apologist indeed to
wish away the racism of _roughing it_ (1872, an early work)---this
directed, as many of you are no doubt aware, against native americans... i
still like lots of twain, sure---and the way i see it, through the brothers
allman, 'if he's no saint, he sure as hell ain't no sinner'...

though of course, and as twain himself would no doubt concur, we may all be
sinners in a more general sense...

some of what may appear "obvious" in huck finn, btw, may not be that
obvious... witness the ongoing controversy surrounding, is it?---_was huck
finn black?_... someone help me out here, please----an analysis of black
dialect when applied to twain's dialogue, with somewhat surprising
results...

but as to teaching per se, permit me to digress...

i think here of christopher hitchens's provocative piece in this month's
_harper's_, "goodbye to all that:  why americans are not taught history"...
in which hitchen's nicely distinguishes twixt two equally useless ways of
approaching history---i.e., the e-z "pc/multicultural" path (more and more
the domain of corporate sensitivity training and the like, i would argue),
over and against that of the true believer (patriotic, conservative, etc.,
and corresponding master narratives)---only to land on what sounds to me a
whole lot like a or perhaps the historical dialectic, with socratic
overtones...

along the way, btw, he manages, like so many others, to seem an apologist
for---guess who? no other than twain (sans ref. to _roughing it_,
naturally)... and why is that?... there was some controversy a while ago,
btw, again in the pages of _harper's_, as to whether we should teach twain
AT ALL (and not b/c twain uses the 'n' word)---forgot who argued thus
(someone famously academic), but the argument as i recall turned on notions
of canon formation, relative value, etc....

ok, i like hitchens, he makes me laugh out loud... but what seems absent
from his various claims regarding the failure of instruction in
history---with which i generally agree---a failure that points to no golden
past (for him OR for me), is any real insight into teaching other than a
sort of "cultural literacy," content-based approach to same, buttressed,
again, by a working grasp of competing historical claims (and here hitchens
cites, approvingly, e. d. hirsch)...

there is, that is, little sense in reading hitchens that the broadly
sociopolitical (ok?) context in which historical instruction (all formal
instruction) takes place, the classroom (itself housed within the
college/university), should itself be understood in generally historicized
and overdetermined terms... of the roles of "instructor" and "student,"
e.g., in said historicized, achingly institutional confines... of the
distribution of power, through knowledge, as real-ized in such confines...
etc etc etc, and regarding which i am so obviously at some pains to
detail... i won't bore you folks, as i have in the past, with my "radical
teacher" claims, if that's what they are (---and when i use the term
"radical teacher," i mean to refer to the movement, the journal, etc., all
ostensibly with the purpose to help *liberate*, to provide meaningful
social transformation through learning---which so many instructors find
such a distastefully direct form of advocacy, i know, but which yet seems
to me a worthy aim)... and i'm not suggesting for a second that we don't
need or couldn't use more content, or dialectic, or whatever---or that we
must be purists in our teaching goals, or learning  (and learned) desires...

but what i *am* saying is that one common denominator of the various failed
enterprises that mark the instruction of history, as well as so many other
fields, would seem to be their tendency to ignore the full implications of
that historical insight and contextualizing to which i refer above (of the
classroom, or expectations, etc.)... and that this perhaps provides some
idea of where to begin, again, a dialogue---which of course would include
the question of bringing variously racist works into the classroom, along
with variously racist bodies and variously racist thoughts...

best,

joe

whether or not huck finn is a racist tract, it is believed to be both
racist and anti-racist, by different contingents and sometimes the same
contingents (see Eric Lott's work, for example, which could be construed as
both and anti-racist in intent and apologist in effect).

Meow Press has finally resumed its production schedule after a nearly
three month hiatus. All of the various equipment, supplies and book
parts are out of storage. After a relocating to Spring Valley, though
keeping a tony La Jolla p.o. box, the production gnomes here in this
tiny apartment are excited to bring forth more poetry products in the
coming months.

In celebration of the move to San Diego, Meow Press has added some new
items to the catalog. Summer subscribers will receive these gratis.

Jerome Rothenberg, _Paris Elegies & Improvisations_. 24p., $5.00
Bobbie West, _Scattered Damage_. 32p., $6.00
Joel Kuszai, _"A Miscellany"_. 56p., $6.00*


Recent Publications:

Ben Friedlander, _Selected Poems_. 40p., $6.00
Don Cheney, _The Qualms of Catullus & K-mart_. 32p., $6.00
Noemie Maxwell, _Thrum_. 24p., $5.00

In Production Now:

Peter Jaeger, _Leasing Glass_.
David Carl, _The Library_
Stephen Ratcliff, _Signature_

and more!

*Limited Edition. I decided to publish my own book because it was time
to be done with it and chasing after other publishers seemed like a task
fraught with difficulties and discouragement. It is important to me,
also, to be done with this particular work. While I may continue working
on it (indeed this is just the first nine sections), it is time to make
it available to a general--albeit specific and limited--public.

Hilton Obenzinger brought up the issue of how _Huck Finn_ is taught in High
Schools, an issue which was brought to light for me last year when _Huck
Finn_ was the University's "Text and Community" selection.  "T and C" is an
program here at George Mason in which a single work is chosen to be
assigned in several different classes, along with presentations at various
University venues dealing with the issues in the work.  One of the
questions I asked my classes about _Huck Finn_ was how the racial aspects
were covered in their HS readings of the book (assuming that many had read
it in HS).  The response was surprising to me: the racial issues were
ignored.  Responses were generally along the lines of "we didn't talk about
that" or even "we were told not to talk about that" (though I don't think
anyone "told" them this outright. . .)

Hey folks: I just got the first issue of listguy Bob Archambeau's new
periodical, _Samizdat_, and I'd like to put in a good word for it: _Sam._
displays the usual first-issue jitters, of course (someone listed in the
contributors' page who's not in the mag, for instance), but other than
that, it's outstanding -- translations of Polish and Swedish poets, good
essays on their work, etc. I was also glad to see sections of a serial
poem by Michael Barrett, a former UIC colleague of mine. For me, however,
the most interesting thing was a review by Nathan Wallace of Selected
Works volumes by Reginald Gibbons and Rosmarie Waldrop:  Wallace
highlights common elements shared by both of these poets (whose works I
never would have thought of together) without blurring important
differences.
        Well worth checking out if you haven't already seen it yet.

roaring, crunching noise and a chunk of the hill fell off and covered the
person up to his neck. The person, being a young classical poet fresh from
NYU, begun screaming that he was being buried alive.  Fortunately, the
landslide stopped and we dug him out and dusted him off. That was the last
time he said anything against William Carlos Williams. The next day he
began reading _Journey to Love_ rather feverishly."

For what it's worth, Attali's book has been very importing to Nate
Mackey's thinking around jazz, particularly in "Sound and Sentiment, Sound

Dale -- while I don't have it in front of me to quote directly from, I've
been reading Howard Zinn's People's History of the US recently & your
words on words entering the body get me thinking about the laws passed
before/after the writing of the Constitution & D of I that were designed
in large part to further divisions between whites & blacks, specificly
white indentured servants & black slaves as there were enough instances
of their banding together to revolt against landowners to constitute a
real threat to what was, at the time, a somewhat tenuous power structure.
Furthermore, additional laws were passed intended to prevent interracial
relations between individuals from reaching any real intimacy (physical,
emotional, intellectual, down the line) much less getting past
master/slave. I have a feeling I'm not telling you, or anyone else on
this list, anything you don't already know, but I think there's enough
evidence in our own legal history as a country that racial divisions in
America were/are, in part, ushered into the blood, if you believe racial
divisions are in the blood, by the word of the law & specific lawmakers
which is a different beast altogether from the body & the intellect.
That's not to imply that blame ought to be conveniently assigned to laws
& lawmakers, but any conversation about racial divisions might make use
of how legal language has managed to further those divisions; one might
thereby prevent such a conversation from reeling solely between the
pillar & post of intellectual & emotional responses (& the further
divisions created by that opposition).

Aldon -- I don't know of any instance where I was taught or witnessed the
teaching of ideologically anti-white literature/writings. in my own
teaching experience (teaching comp & remedial english at Brooklyn
college) I've encountered the kind of "awkwardness" Shana mentioned (or
isolation was the word I think) in regards to James Baldwin's "Notes of a
Native Son", tho' only mildly, &, on a different wavelength, have had
Stein's article "A picture of occupied France" be described as "the kind
of writing that makes people believe the Holocaust never happened".

will hog more than one post to the list this morning (west coast) as I
don't want to mix this response with other threads --

Jacques Attali's _Noise_ makes a number of really interesting points, but
is marred by some weird errors --

identifies Carla Bley as a black musician -- refers to Beaver Harris by
first name only, then compunds the confusion in the index by identifying
him as "Paul Beaver" (we know it's Beaver Harris because it's in the
context of his group The 360 Degree Experience) -- lines such as "free
jazz, created with the Black Muslims . . . "[confirming my suspicion that
prepositions are the biggest problem for any of us moving in a second
language]

ordinarily I would guess some of these were problems of translation, but
the translation was done by Brian Massumi, who is usually quite good --

read the book anyway, but be on guard!

yeah. good advice, aldon. Attali is known as something of a careless writer
-- can't remember if it is this book or an earlier attali (maybe the one on
time & time-pieces?) that created a major scandal in France because of
rather obvious plagiarisms.

And please allow me to second that plug for Bobbie West's book, _Scattered

have particularly appreciated the new posts from Hilton and others -- some
refreshingly clear thinking here this AM --

one of the problems with Huck in the classroom has been that few readers
seem to be able to talk about a text that is simultaneously racist and
antiracist -- I should have thought that anybody who'd read HEART OF
DARKNESS would be able to have such a discussion, but it seems to send most
Americans into hysterics --

If you've read widely in Twain, you already know that he was a man holding
deeply contradictory ideas about race and nationality -- Hilton points us
back to Pudd'nhead, and if you reread the final pages of that book you'll
see much of the problem spread out before you --

a colleague at San Jose State a few years ago (David Mesher) gave me a
great way to introduce some of these issues in class -- he had gone through
several of the major anthologies that include Huck and copied out the
footnotes that accompany the first appearance of the word "nigger" --
[quick example -- the seventh ed. of _The American Tradition in Literature_
gives the following: "In slave states, 'nigger' was not necessarily an
abusive word, but merely the ordinary colloquial term for a slave." --
there are three or four class's worth of discussion there, beginning with
that first phrase!] It was quite a revelation, and examining the rhetoric
of those footnotes afforded a way of broaching the construction of race in
that book without quite the level of hostility that often is to be expected --


And lest we forget, the first groups who wanted to banish Huck were "white"
folks -- hardly "PC" --

I've no doubt that at any period the discussion of any work will center on
issues that seem pressing contemporaneously -- but just WHEN in U.S.
history would THIS not have been a pressing issue?

Anselm, I agree with you, and thanks for the reminder of how focused,
direct and effective legal coucil has been to maintain racial divisions
in this country (don't forget also about the Law and Real Estate's
collusion in many places to maintain separation). Still, the question
exists, how best to discuss race, or teach Huck Finn, etc. And, like
you, I think that contradictory impulses of visceral and cerebral
origins run through us as a people because of these Legal and
theoretical manipulations. If someone wanted to explore the "legal
language" of racial division in this country the resulting study would
be rich in details of the corruption caused by certain wealthy
interests. And then, what of the results? What does our knowledge really
do for us? I think that it's good for conversations about race to be
very tense--stretched--because the alternative avoids the sticky realm
of experience for theoretical possibilities, is slack, lazy or
indifferent. I don't suggest addressing issues of race, or anything for
that matter, through separate conditions of emotional or mental
activities. Both aspects could be fused to enhance intellectual
understanding with emotional realism through the speed of bodily
perception. Part of the trouble is that our language can be so divisive.
And, not that you would misunderstand me, but to clarify as much for
myself as anyone, what I mean by "blood" is genetic, cosmological,
asocial, astrological, atavistic, ancient pre-law, pre-US sort of stuff.
Which is another conversation. What is so interesting to me about racial
discussion is that a language like English that is normally so
compartmentalizing and total has to be made compact enough to reflect
the strange, fluid migrations of thought into the body, and vice versa,
when subjects of race come up. So thanks for the thoughtful note and
give me some ideas on narrowing the gaps between those pillars and
posts.

Your Pal,

Dale

With clarifications like this, who needs confusion? I am totally in the
dark about what any of this means. Is the genetic the astrological, for
example?  Is English inherently compartmentalized?  Is compartmentalizing
the opposite of compact?

        It seems light years ago that Leslie Fielder saw a gay text in
Huck Finn--the desire to get away from women and get to the Indian
territories --the West--(though Twain already knew himself what lay out
there)--and "go native"--a strand for sure which as Fielder demonstrates
runs through much of American Literature--"the Vanishing American"--the
"gay camerados" so to speak--
        the anti women strain--the wilderness, away from laws and money
(though Twain had written so much of money in Roughing It and other
works--The Gilded Age, Life Along the Mississippi and so on--the buried
treasure aspect of life that Huck and Tom dream about and play at--)
        away from religion--
         of course the best way to "become Indian" is to get rid of the
Indians first--and make a Frontier Land theme Park where it's "safe" to
play out the roles, mix up tribes and customs and languages and create the
kind of Pan Indianism trhat threatens to be a New Age colonialism that is
a kindler and gentler way of repeating the first brutal waves of
colonisation--
        of course Huck Finn is disturbing book in many ways--one reason
why it's still read--have things really changed so much since its
writing?--walking the streets it's hard to tell how much really
has--
        racism is an American obsession--
        homophobia as advanced by the
Christian Right and others is a form of racism that Protestant groups in
coming to what is now Canada and the USA used to get rid of Indians--the
Indians were ruled to have no souls--they were non-people--so it didn't
count it you killed them--(except as "body count--it was for the Good,
don't you see--and the same
applies to gays now, who are painted as "unnatural" and perverted" in
their "choice"--and so beyond the pale of God's laws and grace etc--
        (the religious/racist aspect also evident in the KKK wwwhich was
originally formed to kill Catholics--who were most often of various
unwanted ethnic groups--)(my relatives all believed JFK was killed beacuse
he was Catholic)--
        one of the dreams of Huck Finn is to come to a place that is
AWAY from
racism (and  women and religion)--but that dream of freedom is expressed
as becoming Indian--both by  supplanting the Indian and imitating
him--(shades of the Duke and the Dolphin and their mangled shams and
charades--)--kind of a bizarre twist on Deleuze and Guattari's idea of
"becoming Indian/Black?Woman etc"--)
        so even in "freedom" from racism, this is only achieved through a
dispacment of racism--to a new sphere, a new identity--which always opens
up the opportunites for
colonization--(both literally and in the Deleuzian sense)--
        an example of this that comes to mind is the Black Holocaust
Museum founded by Mr. James Cameron here in Milwaukee.  Mr. Cameron is the
sole  survivor of a mob lynching in Indiana decades ago--his Muesum is an
expression of his and his people's experince of a continual Holocaust in
the USA--however, many Jewish groups protested the Muesum, because the
word Holocaust is only supposed to refer to "the" Holocaust in
Europe--which is another form of dispalcing racism as it happened
hitorically in the USA and continues today--to the sphere of Europe
        again, this seems a repitition of colonization--to territorize as
D and G say, a word, (Holocaust)to claim an experience soley as one's own
and deny
it to others--or to deny the language for such experiences to
others--returning, as is ever the American way, all issues to a quesion of
PROPERTY--whether in language or land (and both are  often the same
when it comes to PROPERTY--through the device of Naming)--
        and this dispacment helps to divert many of the questions which
Huck Finn prompts, that American history does
        and to divert from history as it happoened here--which is helpful,
for a nation without a history is easier to conform and control--
        one of the points of Huck Finn may be that there is no escape from
Property,Reilgion (or today "Ethics" and "Legality" and so on--) and
Racism--at least as long as one is ever on the run from it, continually
displacing
it in time and space only to reencounter it even in the dreams of freedom
when it is bought at the expense of others (in Huck's case--the Indians
are the next frontier--and then on to Vietnam . . . )
        actually, racism in Huck Finn was taught when I was in high
school--but then that was the Sixties, albeit in New Hampshire--we also
talked abt the class/racial aspect as I recall because the teacher could
look
around the room and see plain as day which kids were going to Nam and
which not--draft or no draft--would Huck have been sent to Nam? you knew
Jim would be--not Tom for sure--and so on--
        the effortsd to ban Huck seem to center around two things:
Lanuage and Racism--
        maybe this is to keep people from learning to make the connection
of Language and Racism with property and from there to the question of
"intellectual property"--and who owns Language---
        (Twain hints at this in a way, in pointing out that the book
contains many different dialects--and often noting the class differences
in language usage--one could go into the exploitation language the Duke
and the Dauphin use to exploit those who lack Royalty--not just of France
but of the Imperial English Theater of the Bard --)
        the Duke and the Dalphin for example raise many questions
regarding the "legitimacy" of claims not only to Imperial thrones and
power, but to the Imperial power of language--deposed French aristocrats
playing British roles (the British as deposed aristocrats of the  America
Revolution)--acting vs. impersonating in terms of claims to property and
language and history--think of "black faced mistrels" or the Boston Tea
Party with its painted "indians"--)
        the arguments abt Huck Finn often seem to want to polarize the
book in an either/or manner--that is, to narrow down, isolate and judge
the book from a "perspective"--and perspective means of course the
structure of the field of vision so that the spectaor is in "the driver's
seat" so to speak--
        rather than to try to open up the shifting uses of language, race,
property, re;ligion, gender et all--and to think about these questions not
just a fiction/fixing of the past, but as enduring fictions and attempts
to fix the present--
        "both and"--
        and, to again adopt the vocabulary of Messers. Deleuze and
Gauttaur (are THEY the Duke and Dolphin, these frenchmen?)--
        "elusive to capture"

I'm another in-the-dark-er. This reminds me of something I never figured out.
What do people mean by *genetic memory*? I always assumed they meant
something asinine and Larmarckian, like that our experiences alter our
genetic material. I take the word genetics very literally. Maybe I'm missing
the point. Can anyone explain this genetic memory?

pardon my toeing a strict post-structuralist line (not one that I entirely
believe in, anyway), but in _Discipline and Punish_ (by now the classic
formulation of this proposition, though Judith Butler has put her own spin
on the issues more recently), Foucault claims that discourse inscribes
itself upon the body (think Kafka's "Penal Colony") to such a degree that
claiming there is atavistic, before culture element of our thinking is not
possible. there is no there there.  for instance, in the atrocities in the
Balkans, it is not nationalism which has somehow inscribed itself on
Serbian soul in the 14th century, but rather the intervention of Milosevic
and others in reanimating (really rearticulating) a cultural discourse
about Serb victimization that caused the conflict.  There is monolithic,
naturally anti-Croat/Bosnian part of the Serb soul, but war criminal
politicians and their lackeys who generated a conflict in perhaps one of
the most mixed of all European societies.  And it was in a rather more
concrete manner than discourse, as nationalists controlled the media
(makes you wonder about NPR--is it an opiate or palliative for
intellectuals?).  That said, I myself tend towards thinking there is a
substrate, not reducible to discourse, that is accessed by rabid
nationalists and xenophobes, only it does not come predetermined.  If the
racism is "embodied," we have to realize that it is because it has been
tattooed onto the amerrican body through law, economics, and culture.
Otherwise, to say there is a tendency to be racist that is "in the blood"
sounds like bad sociobiology.

It's precisely this out-of-hand dismissal of the non-cultural that puts me
off Foucault et al. Sure, we are cultural beings, but we are also mammals;
we are also lumps of meat.


> Otherwise, to say there is a tendency to be racist that is "in the blood"

I'm sure that hard-line post-structuralists would consider "bad
sociobiology" to be a tautology. And sociobiological use of terms such as
"tendency" and "predisposition", while avoiding the determinism of "drive",
"instinct" and so forth, are perhaps worse because of their vagueness. But,
here goes...

I don't think that we have a genetic tendency towards racism, as such. But
I do think we have innate tendencies to recognise differences and
similarities, and that we may have an inbuilt distrust of anything
strange/different/other. Which would make it easy for cultural factors
(especially when combined with territoriality) to mold/channel/twist this
distrust into hatred.

It's never this simple, of course, and when genetic impulses feed their
energy into the complex dynamic systems of human psychology and culture,
the end result may be fear or desire instead (or as well as) hatred.
Attempts to find biological influences upon human behaviour are often
dismissed as being inherently racist/sexist or whatever, as they are seen
to be merely justifications of the status quo: "but it's natural for women
and men to be different blah blah". But I think that it's important to know
all the possible sources for our actions: if we see destructive behaviour
and want to change it, we need to be aware of how difficult it might be.


        Cheers,
                Tom Beard.

1).  Please someone hep me. Hep.

2).  I need to know the locus platypus of the Spicer line that goes
something like "Oh you who have fallen down on your head...."

3).  Have neither the time nor the Advil to skim _The Collected Books
of..._:  would anyone happen to know if not the poem's title, then at
least the precise book in which this line hides.  Who knows this off?

4).  This platypus is very important to me.

Standard Schaefer's questions about NY in the sixties embolden me to try
to reconstruct some musty memories of my runaway teen years on the Lower
East Side.  I remember seeing John Ashbery read at a theater with fixed
seats (and being somewhat astonished at how sedate, or even dull, this
reading was, given THE TENNIS COURT OATH which was and remains my
favorite Ashbery book).  And then I recall seeing Andy Warhol's
Exploding Plastic Inevitable mixed-media show (with the Velvet
Underground) and I *seem* to recall (but is this possible?) that this
event followed the Ashbery reading, in the same space.  Does anyone
remember?

Am also trying to make sense of jumbled memories of a club called the
Dom, on St. Marks Place.  Warhol ran it or had something to do with it
--and yes the Velvets played there too, but it did not have fixed seats
(unless I am severely mentally impaired) and so cannot be the venue for
the possibly Ashbery-related show above.  But I also recall this space
as the Balloon Farm, and in that incarnation it had a distinct Warhol
connection as well.  Does anyone remember this club, which later went on
to have a non-Warholian existence as the Electric Circus?  Am I insane
to be recalling it as the Dom at one point and the Balloon Farm at
another?

Hi Gabe:

It is from After Lorca.  It is one of the false translations, in other
words, doesn't correspond to an existent Lorca poem.  Title is the Ballad
of the Dead Woodcutter.  This line occurs as a sort of absurd refrain:

Oh, you have fallen down on your head.
You have fallen on your head.

1) i know this is elementary and basic and i should already know it, but
just why was the *sentence* the primary unit of interest for many of the SF
langpos?

2) does anyone have any insights into the history of the concept of

this principle evolve to occupy a place of such prominence in what's called

On number 2, my theory is that the present day importance of revision
comes originates from Flaubert's heroic struggle with style. See Barthes'
Zero Degree of Writing.  If it did not originate there this
is at least its locus classicus. But of course there is the image of
Horace polishing his Odes also. Henry James might also be mentioned.

On number 1, Silliman's The New Sentence (correct title?) would be the
obvious point of departure. Does this come from Stein's focus on the
sentence?  Perhaps a reaction to the preoccupation with the line as breath
unit among the Olsonites? Good question.

Rachel,

From one old fogey to another: Yes I remember the Dom and the Electric
Circus but not the Balloon Farm.

My favorite little memory from that year (1966):
Having been totally blown away by Diane DiPrima's chapbook THIS KIND
OF BIRD FLIES BACKWARDS, I attended a reading by her at St. Mark's,
a bare room with some folding chairs and a plain square table in front
of them.  And there she was, in flesh--this petite redhead, hair loose here
and there, in jeans I think, and she read and it was great, and (there
was to be a second reader but I can't recall who) when she finished she
immediately explained that she had to leave right away because she had four
kids at home looking after themselves, the oldest eleven yeas old (was that
Tara?).  The reading was a graceful and exciting (almost) as that wonderful
book, some of which--while my memory of those days has much faded and
probably become distorted--I still have by heart.

Dear Jonathan:

I noticed your response to Gabriel Gudding on the Spicer line. Do you
in fact know of anyone who has done a poem by poem study of _After
Lorca_ to figure out where the "translations" are translations and
where they are not? Or in those poems that are "minotaurs," which
parts are which? I seem to recall seeing something about Robin Blaser
having at least gone into this, but I'm not sure. Have you, by some
chance, done this yourself? I've been working on and off on an essay
on JS's _After Lorca_ and would be very interested if you or anyone
would know something about this.

Ron Silliman's invaluable book's title notwithstanding, I think it was more
a matter of what went on between sentences.  Of course it couldnt be done
without sentences. But I dont remember that much happened with/to the
structure of the sentences. It was how they were laid up against each other
that lit up our lives. We had the principle of discontinuity from any
number of sources, and the challenge then became to have something said by
confronting readers with the decision as to whether sentence 2 follows
sentence 1 in anything more than space. It was as much a matter of "The New
Paragraph," and let's recall Stein's "a sentence is not emotional a
paragraph is."

The proposition--Jonathan's, I think--that the excellent work on the line
by the generation immediately previous, would not be rewarding to improve
upon, and that, therefore, what could be done with sentences, became
attractive, has merit. I would direct interested parties to Bob Grenier's
work at that time,
poems often of a single line, thus sentence as much as line.Then came his
box of cards called "Sentencing" (I think, but cant lay my hands on it
right now; perhaps it was "Sentences"?). A look at the early issues of
_This_ (eds, Grenier and Watten) discloses "sentence-work" by a number of
us. I would suggest this in part stemmed from Minimalism--once you have the
proposition of single-line poems, the path to that particular sub-genre of
prose poetry, opens up. Be good to hear Ron on this (I may here be
repeating what he has said more eloquently in his book), but I know he is
readying himself for his California tour.  David

Alice Notley was born in Bisbee, Arizona, went to Barnard and Iowa (MFA,
1969). She married the writer Ted Berrigan in 1972, with whom she had two
sons, one of whom grew up and became for a short period the manager of
Small Press Traffic. Now married to the British poet Doug Oliver, she lives
in Paris, like Olivia de Havilland. Like her actress counterpart, she
radiates strength, inner beauty, quiet dignity and warmth. She's many
things to many people, and her books include When I Was Alive, Waltzing
Matilda, Doctor Williams' Heiresses, How Spring Comes, a book of Selected
Poems, The Descent of Alette and the new Mysteries of Small Houses. No poet
of her generation has so captured the heart and imagination of the young
writers of today, both for her dedication to poetry and for her
ground-shifting and -breaking mutability, from domestic to epic and back
again somewhere else.

Karen MacCormack's poetry always seems to arise out of a state of
emergency, at the "point of collapse." She would disdain the suggestion of
heroism in her writing, but I read it as a heroic effort to bring light
into the dark conjunctions of language, effort, and technology. I have long
wanted to get another chance to hear Karen MacCormack read in San
Francisco; thank you, Stanford University, and Marjorie Perloff, for
helping to make this dream come true! MacCormack is the author of six books
of poetry, most recently The Tongue Moves Talk (Chax Press/West House
Books, 1997), and Marine Snow (ECW Press, 1995). New from Coach House Books
is the online version of Fit to Print, MacCormack's collaboration with the
English poet Alan Halsey (trade publication from Coach House/West House
Books to follow any minute). Her work has appeared in such anthologies as
Moving Borders, Out of Everywhere, and The Art of Practice. Of dual
Canadian/British citizenship, she lives in Toronto.

Another hero of poetry! Ron Silliman lived in the Bay Area from 1947 until
1995, including 17 years in San Francisco spent variously in the Mission,
Bernal Heights, the Haight, Potrero Hill and "Baja Pacific Heights." He's
now living in an oak wood twenty miles west of Philadelphia, but he always
finds his way back to the Bay Area, just as swallows are said to return to
Capistrano and salmon to swim upstream. The University of Alabama Press
will publish his poem, The Alphabet, in its entirety if he ever finishes
writing it. Silliman is currently a Pew Fellow in the Arts. Quarry West is
devoting an issue to his writing sometime in the near future.

"1) i know this is elementary and basic and i should already know it,
but just why was the *sentence* the primary unit of interest for many of
the SF langpos?" M. Damon

Perfectly good question. Olson's poetics, based on the equation of line
& breath, had been the most rigorous formulation of the previous decade
or two, and one could read a wide range of material (from O'Hara to
Ginsberg) with such in mind [ignoring, of course, a few very pointed
exceptions, such as Spicer and some of Ashbergy]. But there were obvious
flaws with this equation, especially with Olson's superimposition of
Place on top of the whole, so that the prospect of writing in this
tradition began to appear to be a "fill in the blank" completion of an
already implicit literary geography (as in "he breaks his lines just
like someone from Ukiah"). Each succeeding poem would thus be a less
significant formal act.

Sentences and paragraphs were one way out of that. It's worth noting
that the "miniaturist" tendency -- Saroyan, the Grenier of _Sentences_
-- turns up first. Sentences and paragraphs also had the advantage of
raising some international(ist) issues vis a vis surrealism, European
poetry in general, that the excessive jingoism of Olson (or Williams for
that matter) never really addresses. Remember: WCW's complaint against
Eliot was, in part, that it was "too European." During the 60s, only
Duncan and Rothenberg were really advocating for Stein (who was really
hard to get hold of in that period) and nobody quite knew what to do
with Kora in Hell: Improvisations. Harvey Brown's pirate edition of
WCW's Spring & All came out right around 1970 (forcing ND to finally get
it back into print for the first time in about 30 years), and that came
as a huge shock. So, with Coolidge's first long poems, then Ashbery's
Three Poems and Creeley's Mabel and A Day Book, there was just a lot of
stuff in the air. It suddenly seemed to be an area in which there was an
enormous amount of work that could be done without already being weighed
down by too much prior stuff.

Ron:

I don't happen to know much about the writers who were killed under his
regime, but I have just come across the most amazine Chilean poet named Juan
Luis Martinez who does a lot of political punning through things looking much
like syllogisms.  Martinez was bit older than Pinochet as I understand it and
also apparently toward the end of his life became a fan of Spicer's.  I'm
going to try to substantiate my claim about Martinez's greatness with a few
translations in the next Rhizome.  The translator has been working on
Martinez, a slightly younger man Sergio Parra whose politics are overt and
style is slightly straightforwards, a few very young Chilean poets who are
fans of both Martinez and Spicer.  Kinda weird.  Anyway, I will ask the
translator today about your question re:  Pinochet's murders.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

i just received the latest issue of _mike & dale's younger poets_ & find
that the title of the piece i'd submitted to them was mis-printed

should be "aerial photograph of an elephant graveyard";
is "aerial photograph of an elephant".

over the past five years of contributing writing to smaller magazines, i'd
guess that roughly 1/3 of my work has had at least one typographical error
(from missing punctuation to misspellings, problems with layout, etc.).
has this been anyone else's experience?

i find it deplorable that so many small magazines are misprinting works.
where is the careful proof-reading? in order to cut costs and save
time, fewer and fewer small magazines send proofs to writers. but the real
cost is publishing work as it was _not_ intended to be read. too many small
magazine editors seem to have an assembly line/drive-thru mentality
regarding the product:  just get another issue out, no matter the quality
and accuracy, no matter the process, without taking the time to carefully
proof the work. what they end up publishing is _not_ what was
submitted! once an editor tells me they're using my work, i assume
that it will appear (given, of course, the physical constraints of
the magazine) as i wrote it. is this too much to ask?

poets are supposed to be attentive to language, but what good is it if
the publishers of poetry are inattentive? what's the point of even
publishing a text that's full of errors? if small magazine editors want
their magazines to be taken seriously as bringing forward the news, then
they need to get the facts straight and take more pride in their work: a
magazine's reputation is built not only on content but form. editors need
to keep in mind that they're the custodians between the writer and the
reader-- a role requiring pride and careful work.

it may come to this: poets who care about accuracy more than publication
will no longer send work to magazines that do not provide proof or have a
reputation for eagle-eye editing. and readers who care to read what was
actually written will no longer subscribe to magazines that do a sloppy
job of editing. errors are human, and errors in language can be both
delightful and insightful, "wanderings" bearing the maker's handprint, the
beautiful flaw. but an error in the very title of a poem strikes me as
gross carelessness.

in all fairness, there are many small magazine editors who, from my own
experiences, take editing as an art form requiring skill and attention
not unlike the skill and attention of composing a poem. jeff hansen's
_poetic briefs_, juliana spahr and jena osman's _chain_, lee chapman's
_first intensity_, and ed foster's _talisman_ come to mind. such accuracy
should be the norm, not the exception. all it takes is care-- to care
about the language, what you say and how you say it. is that too much to
ask?

I can appreciate Dan's vitriol here though I think some sympathy for
hard-working small mag editors is in order as well.  I'd say time is more
often the significant factor in fuck-ups.  You want to get your issue out,
you're excited, you've got a small window to do it, etc, & you miss
things.  Now, that said, I do think careful editing can and should be
done.  I spent a hell of a lot of time proof reading the first issue of
COMBO and I did it for one simple and polemical reason: to drive home the
point that my project was just as goddamn important as what those
sonsabitches at *Poetry* are doing.  I think I did a good job.  In several
cases where the typography or font-play was intricate I sent proofs.  And
so far no complaints (though now I'm waiting to be blindsided by one of my
wonderful contributors).  I've had, yeah, maybe a third of my poems
include small errors ("a" instead of "an," lines broken wrongly, etc),
and its a drag.  You want things to look right, to look nice.  And if a
little extra scrutiny can keep piece in our little experimental Camelot
then I say lets keep our eye on the ball.    -m.

Don't have Ron's essay in front of me, but he states that the inspiration

also, yes, from Stein.

On number 1, Silliman's The New Sentence (correct title?) would be the
obvious point of departure. Does this come from Stein's focus on the
sentence?  Perhaps a reaction to the preoccupation with the line as breath
unit among the Olsonites? Good question.

Mike's point is a good one.  I, too, have had work published with errors.
However, having also edited, I can tell you that the poets are by far the
bigger problem.  A number of them can't spell and send you eighteen drafts
asking you to change things all the way through the process, sometimes doable,
sometimes quite difficult.  (Right now Jaques Debrot is thinking that I am
speaking about him, but I am not.  Suffice it to say they are actually local--
L. A writers who call you up at all hours to tell you that they because they
think they're doing something typographically innovative, that you should
adjust your magazine parameters).  Some want to know why you list their work
as "Three poems" on the contents page, and not the full title.  The answer is
becausee the full title would take up four lines, include six paratheses, a
footnote or two, and is usually not as interesting as the poem.  I sort of
wish that people of the 'experimental' bent would think a third or fourth time
about why they insist on having twelve picas of blank space between every
third adverb.  With very few exceptions, like Ray DiPalma, who takes his
typography very seriously, I doubt if there is much being accomplished except
being "individuals".  By the way, if you do some fancy typographical work,
take Ray's lead and be willing to send the work already layed-out in Quark
Express or Pagemaker on disc.

The best intro to typography that I've come across is Robert Bringhurst's The
Elements of Typographical Style.  For one thing, he's a poet.  For another, he
gives a solid history on the various fonts, reasons why one shouldn't double-
space after every period, and a number of other details that have made my
understanding of work like DiPalma's a great bit richer.

Another little stunt poets do from time to time is send you prose where they
use "weather" instead of "whether" and then insist it be spelled wrong as if
this makes their book review derridean.  Sometimes, knowing that it looks
stupid, you agree to it and then find out that in the last paragraph third
line down it should be spelled "whether."

Um sorry, I'm laying out Rhizome this week and various little things like this
come up so I'm slightly keyed up at the moment.

I'm very sympathetic to Dan's post.  But I have to say that no small
press publisher that I know of has ever deliberately let a typo get
through. And what's more, it's terribly embarassing when one does get
through. Every editor I know spends a lot of time proofing, and yet it's
almost inevitable that one or two typos will end up in the mag (often in
the goddam *title* or the contents page, or where you put something in
boldface and in really big letters). In editing Witz, I have made almost
every horrible typo you can imagine. And I'm really sorry for every one
of them. I'm even more sorry that there will be more, as hard as I try to
avoid them. (And I send out proofs to authors...still, some typos
remain.) We're talking about one or two-person enterprises. We're talking
about more work than you thought when you started (a lot more). It's a
labor of love, and typos are part of it. Like that annoying habit that
someone you love has...like snoring.

mea culpa.

(oh, and you can find the Witz archives, flaws and all, at
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/ezines/witz --unless there's a typo in that URL)

I've had less trouble with poets, & probably made more editing mistakes
[sorry, Joe] than Standard, so I side more with Dan Featherston on this one.
The basic problim as I see it [he heh] is burnout, and the only solution is
more than one proofreader - somebody other than the editor(s).  This
may soubd nobvious but it's amazing what you don't see after reading
a pile of ms. over & aver.  & I've been a profishional proofloafer, too.

Dan is right - we shd all srnd out proofs to the eithors.  I'm going
to try to do that from now on.  [not to give anyboy the idea that Nedge is
full of errors - oh no!].

Wearing the author hat I think typos in poetry are beyond the pail, terrabul.
& they happen frequently (in my case anyway).  I can tell you an even worserr
story, however - a magazine that held a poem after accepting it for close
to 2 years (publication delay), & then decided not to publish it - without
ever informing me.  This is ridiculous. Fortunately under the Sillimen New
Sentencing Program they are doing 20-to-life in Verbal Max outside
Fingercount, MC [Monte Cristo, Brazil] - a rela helahoel.

in fact, wouldn't the statement that there is a tendency to racism that's
"in the blood" be a racist statement?  unless one argues that all humanity
has racism "always already" in the blood, which makes even less sense given

The technical term for typos beyond the pail would be "spillage?"

An editor who has since gained some notoriety but will nonetheless remain
nameless once asked me to review a book of poems. I thought the book a
crime against humanity and said so, perhaps a bit more diplomatically.
Turned out the poet was a friend of said editor, who accordingly refused to
publish the review.

A friend of mine had written an Irish language textbook for teenagers and
to be sure to be sure got a native speaker to set it.  Unfortunately she
wasn't a native speller and the title ended up with one of the more
toothgrinding grammatical errors (nom. instead of gen. after a double
prep.). He had to endure the comfort of all sorts of friends who rang him
up to assure him that he hadn't dropped in their estimation despite his
mistake.

In another textbook he had a chapter on names and included a kind of grid
with Murphy = O'Murchu etc.  Then there was an exercise with photos of
"well-known" "personalities" like Mike Murphy and so on and the poor
student had to write the jaspers' names in Irish.  The publishers thought
that the photos were a bit tame and replaced them with ones of Severiano
Ballesteros, Claude Van Damme and a host of international celebrities who
had not featured in any way in the preparatory grid.

and Henry, I think I've permanently damaged something due to a fit of

Dan-- I have _no_ sympathy for you what so ever. If you have read the
magazines you send to, you would know what to expect. Apparently you
didn't & rarely ever do, which is accounted for by the number of
mistakes that have occurred to your texts as mentioned in your post.

I don't  remember this one mentioned last month, but for those collecting
versions of Rilke's poem, here is Ron Padgett's adaption, which I just
came across in Great Balls of Fire:

"Autumn's Day"

Rilke walks toward a dime.  I saw.
It was very great.  But now
His shadow is fast upon the sundials.
How then can the winds remind
The shadows it is late?

'Who has no home cannot build now,'
Said Rilke to a grasshopper.

Wander restlessly when leaves are blown.

Not only that, it's amazing you (plural) continue to do it at all.
I'm grateful to all those who, with whatever resources they have (and,
notably, don't have), do this work.

Of course, there's the solution offered by some truly small mags:
simply photocopy the poem _as sent_ and print it.

GAAA GAAA GAAA


Perhaps the hiatus or another name to be assigned the gap common in Ch'an
/Zen writing, Heian aesthetics, Chuang Tzu - not that difference shouldn't
be recognized, but that this gap, demonstrated by the wheels which never
touch the ground (a geometric pleasure and leap), is a space elsewhere
than the rationalized grid of analytic geometry. Where does the Web in a
hyperlink? The address spaced one against another, contiguous, with
in-between browser windows turned grey or holding patterns or slow revel-
ations, but never a leap as such, the ah-ha syndrome or break from one to
another. Never that moment of the eye.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

Or perhaps so, representations say of waka or koan or the liminality of
renga: but these leaps which are beyond or elsewhere than comp.sci, even
with fractal or chaotic mappings. Never that moment where I announce my
death.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

What I'm getting at, I can never reach, those moments which are beyond the
Net or extraneous or forgotten, outside the compass and encompassing. Or
moments where rationality hangs just above the protocols, like fog cur-
tains over violent wilderness, peaks and crags. Never any moment of the
breath or orgasm or awakening. Never any moment of fully-awake. Moments of
peering and dissecting.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

It's there on the tip of my tongue, the difference between the relative
control and audience dispersion/accommodation present on the Net, and
certain leaps in which the space and immateriality of the world are
suddenly manifest in a bewildering manner!

GAAA GAAA GAAA

This tip, just beyond the tongue, is what lures me towards further text,
coupled with the certain knowledge that every line dissolves into perfect
sound. And then nothing. But I am still torn in two, one half remaining in
utter silence, that occasion of an aesthetic which takes time in the midst
of vertical or flat places, serrated or flooded plains, everything on the
edge of the cup.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

In the meantime, there is this, the internals of the sphere, a privacy
that is beyond encountering.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

One might consider the necessity of the Net, which does not exist here -
nor its absence, whether it exists or not. The needs of the non-existent
Net. Nor is it important if or if not the soul is or is not illusion. And
this is of course, holding the course, not Ch'an, not Zen; it is only
indicative of the quiet internals that form a legacy of survival. The
moment of holding the course, moment of coarseness.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

The browser window stutters or there may be a message below, or an error
message bringing the world to a halt; or a grey rectangle tending towards
black, featureless, just for a moment. There may be the declaration of an
image, or a coming-into-the-world once again, of a derailing-memory forced
into uneasy fulfillment. It may say, JUST LIKE THE WORLD, STILL LOADING.
It may say, JUST LIKE THE WORLD, CONGESTION ON-LINE. It may say, JUST LIKE
THE WORLD, TRY AGAIN LATER. It may say, JUST LIKE THE WORLD, GAAA GAAA
GAAA.

GAAA GAAA GAAA

I reread this, Nikuko says, and "there's no gap. It's bleak orientalism,
there's nothing present but haiku factories, turned out peripherals. It's
boy-toy stuff. You want an escape, you want that distance, that moment
where an interior remains closed as such, where ratiocination has no
place on earth. Literally. You're afraid of such. You still can't look
yourself in the mirror but you're willing to be naked any time someone
holds their breath! Your self-hatred fogs the mirror, breaks the jewel,
places the sword in one hole, and out the other!! The tip gleams between
your teeth. People are always injured in the flooded reality of things!!!"

GAAA GAAA GAAA

Oh challenge me, fair Jennifer, says Nikuko, as Jennifer approaches, her
garments rent, her hair streaming in the storm which has kicked up. Every-
thing dead flies by at furious pace. Jennifer-normal-Jennifer, riding
Julu, dark Julu, her gaping maw open to a terrifying degree. Lightning
illuminates the littered land; juniper and canyon pines bend bleak and
ancient branches black against the whimpered moon. Stars make dim streaks
as they fall down the tormented sky, smothered by thick cloud. There are
roars everywhere, resonances from tombs and caves, caverns and dells, more
resonances when mouths open, cackled song. WHOSE MOUTH IS OPEN TO A TERR-
IFYING DEGREE? WHOSE MAW GAPES AGAINST THE BRITTLE LIGHTNING?

GAAA GAAA GAAA

Power lines are downed, new lines redrawn on face and rim of violent rock,
sparks sputter in skeins of lugubrious energy struggling for a sign. Oh
challenge me, Nikuko screams; there aren't signs any more, the ground's
littered with strokes going nowhere, lightnings sintering flesh and bone,
the dead and the dune-dead. I twist and turn on the sword. I can't scream.

Since I came across the idea (I think) in Marjorie Perloff's _Poetry on
and off the page, I have been seeing "page poetry" everywhere, off
(_vide the new _Big Allis) as well as on the web.  Is there a history to
this and has anyone written on it?

        Small (independent) publications are, if I understand my own as
prototypical, working generally in less-than-sturdy formats, inevitably
limited budgets, and with the challenge of distributing/marketing to a
tiny, often irrationally biased group of "individuals."  Thus, one might
at the very least uphold the sort of production standards of the larger,
subsidized glossies.  That is, there must be something vital, important,
insurgent about the work represented. Why else add another little magazine
to the glutted mix? We, as editors, all supposedly care deeply for what we
do, and we do it thanklessly, oftentimes, that is while we're defining
thanks as economic & cultural capital . . .  The practicioners deserve
at least the opportunity to request proofs.  I recently discovered that a
submission of my own was accepted for publication only when the
publication party & announcement to this list had already taken place.  I
waited some time before my copy arrived, full of horrendous errors.  I
started publishing my own little magazine, with no expendable income
anyhow, partly because I was seeing a lot of work that deserved the
treatment [distribution, attractive presentation, simply...publication]
other less pointed (and often moronic) authors were receiving.  And I do
all I can to provide it.  Kenning  --  where quality is job 1!

        Unless, David, Dan hadn't had the luxury of comparing the
evidently perfect magazines against the original submissions.  I think the
problem is rather one of trust and / or cooperation.  This as opposed to
the competitive spirit I myself have sometimes found . . . and find
deplorable.

Dan, I hope I didn't screw up the poem of yours I published recently. My
method is to read the author's hard copy carefully looking for possible
errors on their part, then to scan the writer's hard copy into a
computer, run it through a spell checker, and then re-read it, comparing
it to the original.
Still, a comma will turn into a period, a space between words will turn
into two spaces, etc.

1. Far and away the vast majority of errors are made by the poet, not the
editor, and
2. Poets tend to expect the editor to take more care with the text than
they themselves have taken.
3. Poets often design their poems for letter-size paper and then expect
the same effects to occur on the almost invariably smaller pages of
magazines.
4. Poems whose strength derives from, or are overly reliant on things
like font and type size should be self-published if at all.
5. Poets who are highly innovative/transgressive in terms of punctuation
and spelling shouldn't expect publishers to be editors.

Penultimately, (and this is the really big one), editors die a thousand
deaths when they make a mistake, even if that mistake is not catching a
poet's error.

Finally, a lot of the mistakes that are made are an unfortunate
by-product of the enthusiasm on the part of small press operators without
which most poems would never see the light of day at all. One can always
insist on reviewing the proofs of ones Collected Works if and when it
comes to that.

        I'm not one to parade his grievances in public, but when it comes
to typos and a small magazine which shall remain nameless, I think I have
just cause for complaint. The prose poem that I sent them, an exercise in
the new sentence, was called, when it left my hands, "Parity." Behold :

PARTY

Then things get even more interesting. Dully wiped surferly out. Appauled
for his agrments. Padded on the rare end. Dual to the dearth in a barroom
baral. Her servered from loanliness. He frequented his exployees. Put to
work studing & being trained in prober manhours. Appeaching her forensidly,
he laughed hurtidly, then guggled with derise. 'Not too embressing,' he
drewled. He was gait alight. Socity was noting but hairs and founies. He
intered this realm quitely, with diplomia. Vocationing in Vegas, washing
excoctic densers. Except this avarice.

It gets bitter. They grimmed as they pasted him on the seet. Rubbage. A
fast residing airline. The sweet of his own bow. 'I shall see what can't be
done.' Almost past marring, her truesew. Ampisously he stroked upawed. He
was an archticist. None for his monitory reckonsense, his colonary skulls,
his facal features, his prosuadive ways, parsels of speach. Dewrelic.
Clutting. Spenting. Distoy. Dealth. His honorible dearth & dishonorrible
intensions.  'Put me out of my missuary.' He immulated her, his sparing
panter. Frusted, criped, endemptent. Tried a torch of vingar, waited as a
roamer circulated. Femine. Marvellouse. Stuft. Perfact. Anbily sated? He
sujjected another why out. Forst thought bets thought, anglozied. Cought
speacking. Quit so.



I guess they had Trimar in a jar at that editorial office. Well I won't be
submitting to them again. David

So much for the Dan Featherston Tribute issue . . . And thanks to my
other contributors and compadres for many backchannels of support...



Aldon, I get what you mean by "demonstrable historical variability of
the concept of race." Hoa also thinks that the unfortunate term, "blood"
doesn't account for trans-cultural-hisorical productions of the concept
of race. Other words I would offer are spirit and geist, but even those
sound hollow in the _proof-is-truth_ materialism of social thinking. I'm
only offering thoughts re: the passage and embodiment of racial
experience and dialogue as I've witnessed it.



I'm reading a book called The Genealogy of Demons: Anti-Semitism,
Fascism, and the Myths of Ezra Pound. Do you or anyone else know this
work? Casillo, the author, approaches Pound's anti-semitism with great
depth, digging in to the mythic and psychic "structures" of Pound's
personality as expressed in the Cantos. He addresses the perplexing and
contradictory life and art of Ra by sifting through the mytholocial and
spiritual (pagan, anti-old test/torah) elements that reveal the man's
psychic jig-saw-like pieces. Not an answer to anything, but, an attempt
to articulate demonic energy in our time...





>in fact, wouldn't the statement that there is a tendency to racism
that's

>"in the blood" be a racist statement?  unless one argues that all
humanity

>has racism "always already" in the blood, which makes even less sense
given

Dear Kent . . . others will probably reply to this one too, but the article
you're thinking of is by Clayton Eshleman and it's called "The Lorca
Working," first printed in "Boundary 2," Vol. VI, #2, fall, 1977.  Really
an intriguing article and quite complete.  If you want me to send you a
copy let me know.

Kevin Killian <---terribly glad to hear the news that Lisa Robertson's book
"Debbie:an Epic" has been nominated for Canada's Governor Generals Award in
Poetry.  Could this have happened in the US?  I don't think so.  Go Lisa go!

Kevin Killian <--- crying over awful review in the "Vancouver Sun" which
Donald Allen forwarded to me, review of "Poet Be Like God," a life of Jack
Spicer which I wrote with Lew Ellingham, review which calls book "inept
faggot gossip."  Under cover of night I am sending ninjas to Canada, to
homes and dwelling places of rival contestants for Governor Generals Award
and also to "John Armstrong," reviewer for "Vancouver Sun."  If you are on
this list, "John Armstrong," be afraid.  Be really afraid!

Subject: Spicer's Lorca

Dear Jonathan:

I noticed your response to Gabriel Gudding on the Spicer line. Do you
in fact know of anyone who has done a poem by poem study of _After
Lorca_ to figure out where the "translations" are translations and
where they are not? Or in those poems that are "minotaurs," which
parts are which? I seem to recall seeing something about Robin Blaser
having at least gone into this, but I'm not sure. Have you, by some
chance, done this yourself? I've been working on and off on an essay
on JS's _After Lorca_ and would be very interested if you or anyone
would know something about this.

As a sort of tangent to the small press discussion, I was wondering if
anyone knew of any printers located in the midwest.
I remember this discussion took place before...
_Fourteen Hills_ has been using McNaughton & Gunn for what is now the
third issue, and they are absolutely wonderful. But because we are
funded by the university, I have to get bids for every issue. I haven't
found a printer yet that can even remotely compete with M&G--usually the
others bid at a price twice as high, and it's getting to the point that
very few printers in California will even give us a bid anymore.
I think this is very interesting, that M&G is so cheap because they are
in the midwest--this is the only thing I can conclude. Has anyone else
found a good quality printer at a reasonable price?

what is an "inept faggot" and why are they gossiping?  I read the book and
didn't see any ref. to any "inept faggots."  Is this some Canadian thing?

Have you tried  Cushing-Malloy in Ann Arbor MI? They do many of the
National Poetry Foundation books. Let me know if their estimate is much
higher than what you get from McN&G! best, Sylvester

Karen:

There are a number of short-run printers around Ann Arbor, apparently
cheaper than other parts of the country because none are unionized. About
twelve years back, when I was looking for a printer for the final issue of
Chiaroscuro, I think I got bids from most of the following. And ended up
going with McNaughton & Gunn. But you might try some of these:

Thompson-Shore (734) 426-3939
Edwards Brothers (734) 769-1000
Bookcrafters (734) 475-9145
Braun-Brumfield (734) 662-3291

For others, for reference:

McNaughton & Gunn (734) 429-5411

I'd be happy to give further details on any of these. (Telehone book open
on my desk).

All the best,

John Latta

i've had good results working w/ Thomson-Shore (7300 W. Joy Rd.,
Dexter MI 48130; 734.426.3939, www.tshore.com).  there are a
number of others in the ann arbor area, dunno why there's such
a concentration of printers there but praps that accounts fr th
low rates...

I recommend Thompson-Shore.  In my opinion, they're higher quality than
McNaughton-Gunn and for my purposes better priced.  I'm under the impression
from talking to a few other editors that have used the two that TS has fewer
mistakes.  But I suspect that the best person to ask is Douglas Messerli.  He
seems to have used them all.

Even the largest journals I send to and have appeared in I have read and
know enough people who have appeared there recently so I know the
process they went through. If I really want to appear somewhere, I have
read the journal / mag and many friends have told me of their positive
experience appearing in their pages so I know what to expect long before
sending. In some cases I have purposely chosen to send to a mag where I
knew the text would be mangled. Not to single him out but Ken Warren's
mag has tons of errors and I still want to appear there. It's like this:

A man walks down a path in winter and sees a poisonous snake on the
ground. The snake is freezing to death and needs to be picked up in
order to get warm and survive & finally the man does so upon promise of
the snake not biting him. After a bit walking down the road the snake
bites the man. As the man is dying he asks the snake why he did it.

"You knew what I was when you picked me up. It is within my nature." If
one sends to a mag / journal without having seen it first they are
unaware of the nature of the beast which quite obviously is not the
beast's fault. The only time a question of trust should come up is when
it is a brand new magazine.

Be well

By "whole" do you mean the poem, langauge, the poet, the whole complex
relation of the self to an extended social/historic fabric? I don't
understand how Olson's articulation of the line and breath as he saw it
led to a fill-in-the-blank poetics of regionalism. In addition to a
poet's Geography (literary and physical) don't other things like mood,
temperment and  personality quirks fit into the process in ways that
vary regional distinctions? Olson's writing really seems to express
that, that personality as much as place drives the poem toward its
greatest possibilities.

I can understand shifting the focus from the line and the poem to the
sentence and the paragraph. But I don't understand how geography was
somehow the impetus for that. Or am I naive and misunderstanding
something?

Thanks,
Dale

Hey, where have you been, Dale?  Don't you realize that with the coming
of Poshlosternism, mood, personality, geography, quirks - none of these
things exist anymore!  There's only WRITING, there's only WORDS, there's
only the POEM-OBJECT-THINGUM that will liberate you with a cool ice gelato
of surreal continental discombobulations! The Manner is the manor, the
Artifact is the arty confect!  Them things you mentioned - they just get
way of ART as we can never know it today!

Kent--If you don't mind backchanneling me with a reminder, I'll try to track
down an old Clayton Eshleman essay that was in Boundary 2 years ago where, if
I remember rightly (which I may not), he addresses your question about
Spicer's Lorca and translation.  If folks are interested, I'll post the ref.
to the list.

Ah well, we renamed our school, combining diesel and disembodied into one word.
The official title is, as you all know:

Jack Kerouac School of DISEMBODIED Poetics.

Now that we have made the typos on this list, we will not have to make them
in the magazine.

I addressed a similar question as Dale's yesterday to Ron, and as it may
have reached him after he had set out to California, I repeat it now for the
List at large. If anyone other than Ron had some reactions to this point it
might be valuable as well . . .
_______________________________________________________
        Ron, thanks for this coherent answer to Maria's question -- which
deals with the time I was discovering your work as well. May I ask you
exactly what this means, though?

        "But there were obvious flaws with this equation, especially with
Olson's superimposition of
        Place on top of the whole, so that the prospect of writing in this
tradition began to appear to be a "fill in the blank" completion of an
already implicit literary geography (as in "he breaks his lines just like
someone from Ukiah"). Each succeeding poem would thus be a less significant
formal act."

        Where exactly does he "superimpose Place on top of the whole"? In
Projective Verse? Or in his work as a whole? If the latter, can one
accurately juxtapose the two concerns, namely, Place and Breath Line? Isn't
everyone's sense of breath a little different (contain more quantity or
quality), so that conceivably no two so-called "projective verse" poems
would ever look alike (if such ever existed)?

        No argument with his and WCW's general "jingoism" -- although I've
always found value in knowing one's own history, it's the exclusivity that's
the problem there -- but would you also then, along with Marjorie, claim
that the earlier Williams in "Spring and All" is much superior to the later
(perhaps stroke-induced) three-step lines and thus, for example, "Asphodel"?

        Joe

_____________________________________________________________________
        Ron, I don't understand this and wondered if possibly you could
        elaborate.

        >But there were obvious flaws with this equation, especially with
        >Olson's superimposition of Place on top of the whole, so that the
        >prospect of writing in this tradition began to appear to be a "fill

        >(as in "he breaks his lines just like someone from Ukiah"). Each
        >succeeding poem would thus be a less significant formal act.

        By "whole" do you mean the poem, langauge, the poet, the whole
complex
        relation of the self to an extended social/historic fabric? I don't
        understand how Olson's articulation of the line and breath as he saw
it
        led to a fill-in-the-blank poetics of regionalism. In addition to a
        poet's Geography (literary and physical) don't other things like
mood,
        temperment and  personality quirks fit into the process in ways that
        vary regional distinctions? Olson's writing really seems to express
        that, that personality as much as place drives the poem toward its
        greatest possibilities.

        I can understand shifting the focus from the line and the poem to
the
        sentence and the paragraph. But I don't understand how geography was
        somehow the impetus for that. Or am I naive and misunderstanding
        something?

        Thanks,
        Dale

Dear Kevin and Dear Alan:

Thank you for offering to track down the Eshleman essay. In fact,
about ten minutes after I sent the query, the college librarian
called to tell me that Peter Gizzi's _The House that Jack Built_
had just arrived. Talk about spooks! The bibliography there has
the citation for CE's article along with a number of other essays on
After Lorca that I didn't know about. By the way, the bibliography
also mentions a wonderful pamphlet written a few years ago by Ed
Foster, entitled simply _Jack Spicer_. It's the first citation I've
seen of this furtive little gem (wondering why it wasn't listed in
_Poet be Like God_?) and some of you may want to track it down. It's
published by Boise State, of all places.

Spicer fan that I am, I've been reading Gizzi's book since yesterday,
and it is  fascinating. The transcripts of Spicer doing genius talk
and doing so off the top of his head make one feel like the top of
one's head is coming off. And Gizzi's long afterword is simply tour
de force. A great book, and now all of a sudden we have two big
magnificent books on Spicer. Hip Hip Hurrah for Wesleyan, even if
they first accepted Yasusada and then rejected him.

        Wanted to clarify, if I must.  As per David's strange post which
assumes every one in the poetry game is a beast, or as opposed to David's
parabole, I will just say (metonymically speaking) two things.
        The issue, as I see it, is really rather petty and childish at the
level of Dan & David's posts.  Not that they are not legitimate concerns,
or that the posts themselves were childish, but the issue is larger,
essentially.  Any avant-garde requires some sense of trust and
cooperation, period.
        The issue is not Mike & Dale's Younger Poets.  Not at all.  In
fact my previous comments (metaphorically speaking) come out on the side
of the editors, no?  Was afraid no one was able to make the [obvious?]
miniscule leap from the particular to the general.

Ah, the time has come for proofreaders to get their due. I worked for
FOUR YEARS as a legal proofreader, day in, day out, working full-time
while doing that god-forsaken MFA. I've also worked as a copy editor,
editor, etc., and guess what folks? Proofreading is a SKILL. It takes a
helluva lot of work, energy, and attention. Being a good editor doesn't
mean you're also a good proofreader. Being a good writer doesn't mean
you're also a good proofreader. But we ALL miss errors ALL the time.
Moral of the story: get someone, and then someone else, to read behind
you. And every time you see those squeeky-clean small mags, know someone
sweated blood and then some to get it right. Ironically, in the
publishing world, these are the people who are paid the least. Typical.

Thanks to all you editors out there doin' your deed. Keep it up kids.

p.s. Please direct any comments as to proofreading errors in this post
to my current boss whereupon I shall receive proper chastisement.

Thanks,
Kathy Lou

I edit & proofread technical materials, and can attest to the fact that no
matter how hard you work, there's always *something* amiss, even if only an
extra spacing or a missing period. And until you rev the manual, you always
remember every flaw & its location.

And after the revision, of course, there are new & ever more horrifying
errors.

Sure, it is awful, seeing a bit fat typo in the middle of your poem, but in
the grand scheme, isn't the actual underpaid (if at all), sore-eyed,
low-blood-sugar-suffering-before-lunch-and-the
first-of-the-month's-coming-and-rent-due, etc.etc., person trying to do
right by your work more deserving of our compassion than any great American
poem???

I am a bit parabolic in my meanderings, I thought a known blues example
involving a snake would lend a certain pitch which has apparently been
lost. I am assuming the following:

1. People with previously said complaints don't read the magazines they
send to. If they were familiar with them they would know what the
magazines entail. I have no problem with M&D, just with a contributor
griping about it. Mike & Dale & Hoa went through the trouble to put
together an issue; that proves merit, intent and dedication to the art.
The act of someone writing something and sending it means nothing. It is
a self serving act which anyone can do. Any mailbox can attest to that.
Submitting means less than nothing if the author is not respecting the
space they send work into. If the error is that big a deal, there is
only one solution I know: start a magazine. I started a journal five
years ago because I was disgusted with the fact that there were few
worth reading.

2. I fail to see how proofing problems debilitate the notion of
avant-garde.

^^the issue is larger, essentially.  Any avant-garde requires some sense
of trust and
^^cooperation, period.

3. Upholding the notion of avant-garde is petty in and of itself. Unless
there is some individual gain or livelihood which depends upon upholding
the "avant-garde" why would one forward this idea? Let alone conflegrate
this issue as if there is an importance in specificity. If I substitute:
Any magazine requires some sense of trust and cooperation, period, that
statement appears too obvious to be what we are supposed to head for. So
what is the larger issue? I trust certain folks based upon the work they
have done & they do the same. I have faith they will perform comparable
work in the near future & so on.

Be well

Consent, s/ms' World, says


In Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores, Understanding Computers and Cogni-
nition, the authors, playing off Maturana's "Biology of Language," write:
"Language, as a consensual domain, is a patterning of 'mutual orienting
behavior,' not a collection of mechanisms in a 'language user' or a 'sem-
antic' coupling between linguistic behavior and non-linguistic perturba-
tions experienced by the organisms. [P] Maturana points out that language
is connotative and not denotative, and that its function is to orient the
orientee within his or her cognitive domain, and not to point to indepen-
dent entities." Thus we can speak of Umwelt, which connects with the mic-
roworlds developed early on by Winograd. The word "consensual" is employed
by Maturana, of course, but there are issues, right from the start of pol-
itical economy and idiolectical defense mechanisms: "I refuse to be under-
stood," said Julu, while Jennifer, thinking the same, refused to speak at
all.

The positing of mutual orientation, which Maturana has been stressing for
decades, problematizes the truth-functional aspects of language, while
salvaging performatives for the processes of orientation. One might also
see the orientations among actants, which may be virtual or real or virtu-
al-real, depending on one's ontology, among other things/emissions.

One might also bring a psychologized Bourbaki into play, considering such
orientations the result of partial mappings among mother-structures which
constitute fuzzy domains of fuzzy behaviors.

Here is a Maturana quote from the book: "When two more more organisms
interact recursively as structurally plastic systems, ... the result is
mutual ontogenic structural coupling.... For an observer, the domain of
interactions specified through such ontogenic structural coupling appears
as a network of sequences of mutually triggering interlocked conducts....
The various conducts or behaviors involved are both arbitrary and con-
textual. The behaviors are arbitrary because they can have any form as
long as they operate as triggering perturbations in the interactions; they
are contextual because their participation in the interlocked interactions
of the domain is defined only with respect to the interactions that con-
stitute the domain.... I shall call the domain of interlocked conducts...
a _consensual domain._"

Julu is turned out by mother-structure Nikuko in a rite that involves
consent and consensual construction of a world, or phenomenological hor-
izon; the stage is the sememe, offered, proffered, controlled. Julu is
always already within the theatrical scene, much as Brenda Laurel speaks
of theater in relation to human-computer interactions, and Jennifer might
speak of, in relation to Julu and Alan, Alan and Nikuko, of sado-maso-
chisms. These s/ms are part-objects, relays, micro-contracts among parti-
cipants, willing or not; they involve the impetus of one or the other or
both to remain within the game, which is always a game since it is the
rule-giving or rule-structuring of the real, in dialectic. Think of the
s/ms as lightnings across the sememe, _fissurings_ which pass as _inscrip-
tions,_ - in other words, divisions of same/same passing as epistemologi-
cal operations of classification: _x_ and _not x_ - or, more to the point:
Now! and Not now!

What is marked is time, the impetus/impulse/inertia of _remaining in the
game,_ of language and consent: in other words, The Game of Remaining in
the World.

The game involves consent. The game involves desire and s/ms. The game is
always partial, always close to breakdown, rupture, fissuring, splits and
splays which require further-culture to heal.

There's no truth to the game; there are performatives. Every statement is
performative, and every performative, a statement. Everything _construes._

The game is all the truth there is, and for further truth, there are
events, defined (as I've pointed out elsewhere) as the union of attributes
filtered by k-ply intersections of descriptions. (For example, one has 20
descriptions of an event, with a total of 8 attributes; let k = 3, then
look for those attributes mentioned in at least 3 descriptions; take the
union of these attributes as a best-fit description of the event.) Attri-
bution becomes a primary focus - both for the constitution of meaning, and
the development of the appearance of autonomy vis-a-vis superstructural
symbolic domains: the real-virtual, or the virtual-real, take your pick.

This is not to say that there is no asymbolic; in fact, consensuality
skirts the asymbolic and asymbolia, and may as well (best fit) be founded
on the same. Only that, when one moves into the realm of the virtual, one
is also confronted by issues of constitution, languaging, and protocols;
consensuality becomes charged and operative and, to the extent that it is
synonymous with handshaking, the only game in town.

So we might go in circles here, says Julu. As long as you are chained to
me, replies Jennifer, new at the game, but shaved and ready as the perfect
mirror.

(The pain of the world, says Jennifer? There's no game there; it enters
elsewhere, but every confrontation with death is private, an idiolect of
murmurs, silences, of mother-structures _with no sense at all._ She purred
[reminding one, said Alan, that wounded cats may purr as well, cats' bell
tolling in the distance. And the bell? An s/m. And the purr? an s/m too,
as every thing, non-thing, as in nothing, word to the mother "as well."].)

        I wonder when the phrase "little magazine" became "small ditto"?

But I do not write tonight primarily to raise that question. I write to
register incredulity that I am being told I should tolerate typos because
editors mean well. Next, we shall be advised to _enjoy_ our typos! Well, on
the heels of yesterday's botched job, just look at what I received today,
and imagine my feelings. . . this is the last time I shall trouble the List
with my bad luck in this respect. It's too exasperating. This little  poem
was called "Crystal Rock Shop" when it left my hands :

CLYTAS SOCK HOP

Two cystals danegeld
from here ares. Her
lipstucks were blod.
He was gait alight.

Noting out of pace,
scathing his sweatheat's mane
in the already defacted tunk.
She drank heavely, bluew.

Surfered with minstrel tramps
and dislikes of her.
Tow moanratic Spanrods,
senderading bnaith blagonies.

They dindont relish that
the thames had clanged.
How could do joustice
to thir bindless?

   Not this werter,
   hwom never gridated collage.



I always seek the lesson to be drawn. In such cases, maybe we need recall
John Lennon's phrase, "Life is what happens while we are making a plan."
Everyone tries the best they know how. We were living in the forest canopy
just a short while ago.

Many b-c requests to name the magazine that travestied last night's posted
poem, I shall ignore. And again tonight. But the editor in this instance is
a man named Gorbwine.    David.

>By the way, the bibliography [of "The House That Jack Built"]

_Poet be Like God_?) and some of you may want to track it down. It's

Hi, it's Kevin Killian.  Edward Halsey Foster's little hand book in the
Boise State "Western Writers Series" (1991) really is a terrific one,
though if I remember correctly when it came out Ed felt rather bitter about
the fact that his editors had summarily cut out about a third of his text,
which I have bugged him to show me, but he has strong opinions about or
superstitions against revealing his unpublished work.  Will I sound like a
nit picker if I aver that this pamphlet is indeed cited in "Poet Be Like
God," at least on page 381?

We have had some extraordinary poetic events lately here in San Francisco.
The reading Alice Notley gave on Thursday for Small Press Traffic drew a
huge audience, so that we had to keep adding more and more rows of chairs
in front, and still more, so she was reduced to standing in one precise
place, while people sat on either side and even behind her and the
microphone, the stage looked like the end of "Carousel" where the graduates
sing "You'll Never Walk Alone."  Notley responded in kind by giving an
amazing reading of parts of "Mysteries of Small Houses," then moved on to
the noir pulp newsreader "novel," DISOBEDIENCE, and then scared everyone
silly with the new "Byzantine" material, channeling voices a la Hannah
Weiner or Tina Darragh and provoking a tremendously felt ovation.  Some
stood up, clapping, cheering, wiping tears from eyes, hollering hoarsely,
as though Maria Callas had just left the stage.

Last night, Friday, the Poetics Program at New College brought Lewis Mac
Adams here for a reading to launch his new book "The River" (Blue Wind
Press).  Mac Adams explained that he had been out of the circuit for many
years (15?), had not published anything, had been devoting all his time to
environmental causes, and had been coaxed back in to publishing and reading
by Michael Price, Kevin Opstedal and Dale Smith who, between them (among
them?) had returned him to writing.  "The River" is a very fine book (and
only six dollars) and my hat is off to Mac Adams for a grand return and to
Mike, Kevin and Dale for doing a grand and honorable thing in provoking,
assisting and facilitating this rebirth.  The old "Bolinas" crowd was there
in full force but I didn't see to many younger people, perhaps because the
name "Lewis Mac Adams" has been nearly forgotten thanks to some principle
of silence that Ron Silliman has no doubt written up wisely.  Anyhow after
these two last evenings of great emotion I look forward to tonight's
Shurin/Moriarty event to complete this hat trick.  Don't talk to me on
Sunday, I'll be like this--drained out rag . . .

        Let me second Susan Wheeler's recommendation of Tony Lopez' poetry.
Charles Alexander has already posted us re the Tucson/POG reading of last
week, and a welcome posting it was, intelligently opening the work to
further questions and affirmations. I'd simply add, as my twobitsworth,
that this is the poetry I'd been waiting for, a writing that is politicized
throughout, but never denunciatory or haranguing, that integrates its many
elements into a muscular rippling flow like a cross between Alph the sacred
river and the Metropolitan Line. An intense intellectual pleasure (if "A
Tear is an Intellectual Thing") to attend. At Sonoma State, the poet read
to an audience of some 30-35, many of them students, and during the lengthy
Q/A period after the reading, he showed both firmness and kindness in
fielding questions that sometimes came awkwardly out of the confusion we
are apt to feel when confronted with the new.

It gives me much pleasure to contemplate this fine poet being introduced by
another--Susan Wheeler's _Smokes_ is among my favorite books of 98--and I
urge anyone within reach to turn out for this one.  David

One way to do it is to cook dinner for about five of your most literate
friends.  Divide the manuscript into fifths, have everyone read through with
red pen and pass their section on.  Then don't drink too much wine because in
the morning you have to go through and check your proofreaders proofreading.

And as long as John Lennon has come up, I must say both of these mangled

You might well arsk!  About as formative as anything else in those days
when we proceeded by the light of our faithful dog Cragesmure--

"Puffing and globbering they drugged theyselves rampling or dancing with
wild abdomen, stubbing in wild postumes amongst themselves . . ."

Speaking of which, we have two votes for the existence of the Dom and
one for the Balloon Farm, although no rhyme or reason for either.

But Alta Vista turned up a Velvets / Balloon Farm ad :

http://member.aol.com/olandem2/perf6566.html

"October 1966, Balloon Farm (The Dom), NYC
       Exploding Plastic Inevitable"

So I guess confusion reigns supreme, holding her sceptre and orb,

PLEASE BESOKIND AS TO   HELP!
Attempting to update my SuNy-Buf website dedicated to Meow PRess, I
found that I had exceeded my allotted server space. The end of it all is
that Meow Press must move again, this time to a new home in cyberspace.

Because I am wholly dissatisfied with Earthlink, and may abandon this
ISP for a local outfit, I am wary of uploading Meow press there. Does
anyone out there have any suggestions?

What about Geocities?   Is Meow Press commercial, therefore ineligible,
or does the fact that the printer is in my kitchen release me from the
glandular gist of the corporate ghost?

I'd appreciate any experiences anyone can relate to me and any wisdom
that can be offered.

Back-channelling is the challenge...

Dear Kevin and Dear Alan:

Thank you for offering to track down the Eshleman essay. In fact,
about ten minutes after I sent the query, the college librarian
called to tell me that Peter Gizzi's _The House that Jack Built_
had just arrived. Talk about spooks! The bibliography there has
the citation for CE's article along with a number of other essays on
After Lorca that I didn't know about. By the way, the bibliography
also mentions a wonderful pamphlet written a few years ago by Ed
Foster, entitled simply _Jack Spicer_. It's the first citation I've
seen of this furtive little gem (wondering why it wasn't listed in
_Poet be Like God_?) and some of you may want to track it down. It's
published by Boise State, of all places.

Spicer fan that I am, I've been reading Gizzi's book since yesterday,
and it is  fascinating. The transcripts of Spicer doing genius talk
and doing so off the top of his head make one feel like the top of
one's head is coming off. And Gizzi's long afterword is simply tour
de force. A great book, and now all of a sudden we have two big
magnificent books on Spicer. Hip Hip Hurrah for Wesleyan, even if
they first accepted Yasusada and then rejected him.

Let me take this up briefly, since Susan Wheeler identifies Lennon's book
(& surely would include the other one, "A Spaniard in the Works") as likely
instigation for my two little pieces of typo. I did look at both books when
they appeared, but they didn't hold my interest. I think because I wanted
them to be more Lennon songs? Approached in the context of nonsense
writing, however--as I approached them today, grace of Susan's post, and
Rachel Loden's--they are eminently readable. And my pieces do appear to
stem from those books as source.

In truth, many years ago I proof-read a gothic novel for a severely
dislectic author. It was hard slogging, and I kept myself going by copying
down some of the more telling portmanteau constructions. A few of these, I
organized into the units you have seen, supplying others of my own based on
the original. As a reader of college essays, I may also have recalled some
chestnuts from exams I read. What can open up from a distorted word or
phrase provokes me today as it has all my life. I was only a child when I
read about a local newspaper having to print a retraction because it had
referred to "Colonel Jones, the battle-scared veteran," but came out with
"Colonel Jones, the bottle-scarred veteran." The imp in language keeps
returning the repressed.

In the gothic novel, set in the last century, the 4-y-o son of a single mom
("Unfortunate Woman") tiptoes to the toilet in the middle of the night, and
on his way back looks through the half-open door of his mother's bedroom
only to see her humping the vicar (often spelled "vigor"). The vicar
notices the child staring at him & his partner, and cries out indignantly,
"the boy must be severely wiped!"

I have a first edition third state of Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel.
Third state means that after they printed a bunch they found some errors,
corrected those and printed some more, found more errors, corrected those
and moved on. It's not a new problem. The solution, as Mark of the Song
says, is obvious.

If it were easy to do the injunction wouldn't be necessary--everyone would
have done it.
Editing a magazine or press is a related but separate art form. A great
publication or a great poem is such a rare event that it would be hard to
quantify or qualify the energy that goes into the production of same. No
need to denigrate either venture. That said, care in proofing is the
editor's first responsibility to his readers and contributors. Typos are
distracting, and they often change the substance of the writing. Occasional
flaws will get through, but the unrealizable goal should be perfection.

No.  In many ways not.  Sure, there are editors who get the odd favor.  And
writers who get whatever they want because of some snowballing effect from say
winning a contest.  But, the majority of editors that I've known don't get
that many favors.  Several of them on this list may be able to testify to
that.  To edit a magazine well, to raise the money to do it, takes a lot of
time.  Often at the expense of one's own writing.  Of course, there are any
numer of strategies to waste time and to speed up the process.  If an editor
solicits, that takes an enormous amount of time.  If an editor just
photocopies originals, that takes less.  At any rate , it is not as simple as
Tom Orange has stated.

Good to hear that the big anthology's now out, Lawrence.  Does us
contributors get copies?  If not, would you be interested in trading
a copy or two for some Runaway Spoon Press books?

Let me know what the reaction to the book is.

This seems a little restrictive.  If we don't apply this standard to
classics such as "Un Coup de Des," should we expect contemporary poets
to be held to it?  Certainly editors are free to publish or not publish
any type of work they choose, but that's just the point-- some magazines
(_Juxta_, for example) do publish a lot of work of this sort, & that's
really one of the nice things about the independence of little
magazines: it allows for a multiplicity of standards, & discourages the
establishment of an overreaching "standard" (a little magazine
stylebook?).  Not that, I'm sure, you were intending to suggest such a
thing, but I think your use of "should" does suggest that (too
restrictive) interpretation.

Just wanted to remind East Coasters that they too can see Alice Notley =
read this week:

Wednesday, October 28 at 8 pm
The Poetry Project at St. Mark's
reading with Kate Rushin

I believe Notley is reading at Brooklyn College on Monday, Oct. 26th =
too,
don't remember what time, but it is during the day, perhaps 2 pm. =
(e-mail me at the Project-poproj@artomatic.com-if you want to know =
specifics; I left flyer there)

Monday, October 26th at 8 pm
 Magdalena Zurawski & John McNally
at the Project

There will be a convoy from Bernadette Mayer's reading at No Moore =
(which begins at 6 pm) uptown to see Zurawski & McNally afterwards. =
Please come to see both! It is Mayer's last reading for the amazing =
"Devotional" series she has been doing for the entire month at No Moore =
(corner of No Moore St. and West Broadway). Last week she read for 3+ =
hours--it was incredible, unbelievable, transcendant, =
once-in-a-lifetime.

Other reading hi-lites this week: Bill Luoma & Tony Lopez at Poetry =
City, Teachers and Writers, 5 Union Sq. W, 7th floor.

And those are my crit picks for today.

Unfortunately, literary magazines have become the sea, which literature
flows into at will. How editing a mag is self serving I can not see from
my vantage. I find running a press is a position of service and an
excellent way to have a fuller view on current writing phenomena. There
is the funding Standard writes of, the reading, & the marketing.
Marketing each title to its fullest potential has its detrimental side
in terms of exposure to individuals. Most of whom never read the
journal. I read about 15-20,000 pieces in a given year not including
chapbooks & full length books. The issue is 64 pages minus eight for
front matter & contributors and another 10-15 pages taken by the
featured writer. That leaves forty pages for those submissions. Pound
spoke of having the constant contributors published to anchor the
journal then an element of surprise for the rest of the issue, an area
ever revolving which anyone could appear in. I find that works for me.
The price to do that is an entirely different situation though. There is
no ease, except if one were to chose to publish a mag which doesn't
appear in International Directory Guide, Poet's Market, PEN awards, SPR,
Loft etc. Then I would question how many individuals who are not fully
accomplished writers will read the issue and be exposed to its
possibilities. As for placing the cart before the horse, if someone
needs to write they will do so at any and all costs; I rely on that
fact, and provide an outlet and audience for that venture. A journal
must be of its times without giving in to them. As was written, there is
no need to denigrate either the editor or writer for what they
contribute. At the same time, in the sea of people writing, the writers
are few.

I believe that people long to be the amateur discoverer but few ever
place themselves in this position. Our societal normative causes this
condition. The market needs consumers of entertainment but the creators
are not an option offered, let alone a person who abandons entertainment
to create and is satisfied through the act. Upon escaping the purchasing
frenzy I doubt an editor needs to traverse the psychic woods of the
unconscious before they will be able to edit a journal of truly great
writing. Although the editor who forwards a journal into art form
creates a forum which is more than an extension of content.

Be well

In a message dated 98-10-25, standard writes:
"To edit a magazine well, to raise the money to do it, takes a lot of
time.  Often at the expense of one's own writing.  Of course, there are any
numer of strategies to waste time and to speed up the process.  If an editor
solicits, that takes an enormous amount of time.  If an editor just
photocopies originals, that takes less.  At any rate , it is not as simple as
Tom Orange has stated."

wasn't stating that editing a mag is simple (hardly!), only that writing
and submitting should not be denigrated while editing is upheld as
something purely altrustic and thereby more noble.  both writing and
editing are forms of practice that involve conscious choice based on real
and perceived gains and losses.  e.g. editing may take time away from
one's own writing with the tradeoff being the positioning of oneself as
the gatherer/selector/promoter of other's writing.

Okay, one's self in addition to the other selves who volunteer for the
job, but how is that
>equally self-serving as writing a submission?  and just as easy to do
as you asserted in a previous message?
How is promoting others at ones own expense of time, money, energy, and
ones own work as "self-serving" as submitting poems to be published at
someone else's expense of time, money, energy and work?

PS to Mark DuCharme: Just my opinion that poems whose strength lies in
language, words, ideas and the like are more interesting than poems whose
strength depends on fonts, etc. To each his/her own.

Sometimes I forget and write the English I was taught is proper, instead of
"his or her," which is my usual compromise. Is there a pc way to do this in
languages in which all nouns are gender-marked?

If a writer wants to make himself or herself appear truly ridiculous,
s/he ought to ensure the PC [pronominal correctness] his/her scrivenage,
s/he need only mindlessly cleave to the hermaphroditic fallacy &
fruitlessly multiple entities, contra Ockham. When possible, I use
plurals; if not, I usually manage to fend off the harpies of PC & employ
the masculine singular, unless the feminine makes more sense.

Why savage the tongue? PC usage makes the writer seem *primarily*
concerned with avoiding the *appearance* of sexism, rather than with
communicating any particular ideas. It says "don't think; obey." It
ignores, hegemonically, instance for principle, tree for forest. It also
undercuts its own purpose because it provides a mantric smokescreen for
sexists: just perform the magic chant & no one will ever know. Good
intentions don't stiffen this rubber crutch.

what a documentary!  among other things. refreshing to read a bio that's
so much made of interviews (inter-views hey!) i direct projectile

and dry your tears.

and i agree, it _was_ worth the wait.  i waited nigh four months for to
get the new york public library "on order" "coming soon" copy  waited
and fretted and checked its status while other people read it and said
how swell it was. well, it _was_ swell. and then i hadda hurry up and
pass it on to the next person in the reserves line (i kept it overdue)
cuz it's one lonely copy in a system of round abouts 87 branches.
*sigh*  but glad the public library put it up for order in the first
place. So, a note to ny public lie berry users, for those what cant buy,
BORROW! cuz the more demand, the more reason to order more copies!

love and thanks kevin and lewis ellingham for your work,

Sigh. so while i'm still working through my recently received copy of
Mike & Dale's Younger Poets issue 10 i can at least say I've been dazzled
by Roberto Tejada's great translations of Jose Lezama Lima's poems as
well as the interview with Joanne Kyger which I only wish was ten times
longer as Kyger is so terrific & so neglected -- as has been previously
mentioned by Dale Smith, Ron Silliman & others & has been the case for
years but her case seems to me to be exceedingly blatant & unjustifiable
as she is routinely ignored by poets of all shapes sizes and aesthetics
as well as the recent anthologizers of
post-modern/innovative/radical/experimental/non-mainstream/etcetcetcetcetce
tcetcetcetcetcetc poetry. I mean, really.

& I happen to know Dale & Hoa & Mike put a tremendous amount of energy &
work & care into doing their magazine & books. It seems unecessary to
single out M & D's as the object of an anti-typo tirade.

MLA is in SF _this_ december (1998); i'm not sure where it will be in '99,
but it should be mid-continent (denver, chicago, dallas).  a quick purusal
of the '98 program revealed nothing relating to either spicer or the SF
Ren.  ...too bad, it's a good idea...

Hi:
        I am forwarding the following because complaints
that blacks and others are making with regard to the activist and
media attention focused on the Matthew Shephard incidident are, I
believe,
totally valid.
        Shephard's white skin and middle-class status did not save him
from attack, but it did save him from falling into obscurity.
          Unfortunately, few in the lesbian or gay community are willing
to consider such criticims- in part because control over political
discussion is resting almost exclusively in the hands of a few who act
primarily on the basis of class interest-
        Are there no grassroots gay and lesbian organizations left in the
world?
        Dan

Dear Black Feminists,

Has anyone heard/made noise about the Kenyan woman lynched
in the South a few weeks ago?  Have you heard about the
case?  I know that you've have hear about the case of Matthew
Sheppard.  I feel deeply sorry for the fact that this
young, gay, white man was lynched, but can't help notice that,
while his whiteness did not prevent them from taking his life,
it has prevented this heinous act from passing into oblivion,
from passing in silence.  The young Kenyan sister (apparently)
lynched in Alabama, on the
other hand....Let's hear some noise.  I'll see what I can do
this side.

(A friend tells me that she has heard of plans to write a feature
article on the incident; but it might be good to have a Black feminst
response, don't you agree?
peace
Lynette

>>>August 20, 1998

Dear friends, Kenyans and other kind concerned persons,

I have tracked down more specific information about the hanging death of
the young Kenyan woman in Alabama, which many of you know I became aware
of only because of an Internet posting by a nurse in Alabama. This nurse
expressed concern for Catherine, a friend of her 17 year old son, happen
in
Alabama. Unfortunately, no national newswire stories have been run and I
had to hand type the following attached stories from faxes I was able to
needle out of the local paper in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. I hope that you
will join me in disseminating this information to persons and
organizations
capable of bringing some focus and attention to Catherine's death and
the
circumstances surrounding them.

The nurse in Alabama who originally posted the messages that made me
aware
of this story expressed concerns about the strange nature of this
hanging
death and the timing of it. Unfortunately, there seems to be a push by
local authorities toward labeling this hanging death a suicide.  If you
read the stories, I think you'll agree that this story does require
further
investigation.

Catherine Mutheki was a 20 year old Kenyan woman who came to the U.S.
only
in March of this year. She had a perfect 4.0 grade point average and had
never missed a class before Monday. There is no indication that she was
emotionally disturbed from any of the articles I read (see those
attached).
In fact, everyone who knew Catherine felt she was a very happy and
determined person, including one of her teachers who has come forward to
say she does not think it was a suicide. As you may already know,
Catherine
was found hanged by her sweater, from a railroad spurabout 200 yards
from
her dorm room on Wednesday, August 13th.

More surprising about her death, Catherine was hanging low enough from
the
tree that she could have placed her feet on the ground at any time to
stop
it. As far as I know, that is an a-typical form of suicide and, unless
Catherine had been intoxicated or had some other condition, I can't
imagine
that this form of self-asphyxiation would be easy.  Moreover, it simply
doesn't sound consistent with the picture of Catherine painted in the
the
articles by her specific friends. (Apparently, the RN and her son, who
knew
Catherine, didn't think it
sounded likely either.) I believe that there is a strong possibility
that
Catherine Mutheki's death was no suicide but could have been
precipitated
by anger over the bombings of the Embassy in Nairobi.

Because I'm in NYC, I have no basis for this belief other than the facts
as
you shall read them below, and my reading of a variety of posts on the
Internet last week which suggested a great deal of hostility toward
Kenyans
for the bombing. The other basis for my belief is the concern and fear
of
the local nurse, whose son knew Catherine.

If you know anyone who you think should know about this story or who
could
get it into the media (investigative media, preferably) or into a human
rights organization which will investigate it, I would much appreciate
it.
I have contacted the Kenyan Mission to the U.N. in New York - and the
person I spoke to knew nothing about this story until my contacting
them. I
have also delivered this material, or given specific pertinent
information
via voice mail, to a Kenyan paper (The Nation), the Alabama State NAACP,
the Southern Poverty Law Center (which didn't know anything about it),
the
offices of Senator Carol Mosley-Braun, Congressman Charles-Rangel's
office,
Bill Clinton's and Al Gore's
e-mail addresses and to a variety of other sources. I have so far been
less
effective with the media, counting on organized human rights
organizations
to give weight to the story. As an individual who lives in New York
City,
it is difficult to speak credibly to media and others about a story in
Alabama.

Please, however, if you think of someone who might be motivated to
investigate this story, forward this e-mail to them, and send it to
anyone
you know that might be interested.

I have also included various telephone numbers for relevant elected
officials below. If you feel so inclined, you might call them to express
concern about the manner of Catherine's death and you might expand the
circle by calling your own Congressmen, Senators, news media or other
concerned organizations. It would be important, given the circumstances
surrounding Catherine's death and given their proximity to the
international events that transpired in Nairobi on August 7th to
strongly
suggest that you feel that this might be a hate crime and therefore
subject
to investigation by federal authorities, like the recent case outside of
Houston - the dragging death of the Texan man.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at MSWNY@aol.com if you would like
to
discuss more coordinated efforts on this matter.

Thank you,

Martin White (Mwangi)

---------------------------------
August 30th, 1998

Dear Friends, Kenyans and Kind Concerned Persons,

I spoke to members of the Kenyan community in Alabama this evening about
Catherine's death. They had organized themselves from a city in Alabama
and had gone up to Catherine's college. They arrived just in time to
prevent Catherine's body from being rapidly cremated by the college.
Apparently, the school had "not yet reached Catherine's family" and was
anxious to have her body cremated. An odd thing to do with a foreign
woman's body - where the cause of death has still not been officially
determined by the local police.

I learned the following details with regard to Catherine's death:

1. Catherine called a friend in Birmingham the week before her death, at
3:00 a.m., frightened terribly, to say that she had been threatened and
was
very afraid. I will be speaking to the young friend of Catherine's
tomorrow
to find out what Catherine told him/her specifically.

2. A member of the staff of Catherine's College has come forward to the
Kenyans and told them that she/he does not believe that Catherine
committed
suicide.

3. Apparently the Muscle Shoals Police Department is still investigating
Catherine's death and has NOT determined that it was a suicide.
However,
THEY have received many calls from local persons in the community
telling
them that it was a suicide. [A pretty brazen community - if they feel
they
can call the Police and demand a specific finding].

This is just to keep you posted. I have encountered some disbelief that
this is a story from members of the press. The fact that this story has
not
received national attention and that it has barely even received
coverage
in Alabama - seems to be determinative to members of the press.Please,
if
you feel as strongly about this case as I and many Kenyans do, then make
yourself heard to your Congresspersons, Senators, the Justice Department
(Civil Rights Division) and local newspapers that this IS a hate crime
and
a news story and must be covered and must be investigated as a Hate
Crime,
under Federal Hate Crime laws. Mention the Federal Hate Crime Prevention
Act of 1998 if you want to make it
seem relevant to current Congressional business (just about every
Democratic
and many Republican Congressmen and Senators sponsored this bill this
year
- hopefully they weren't just going through the motions).

So long as this story only gets local coverage of the type you saw in my
last e-mail, and the only people demanding an investigation are
foreigners
(or New Yorkers), Catherine's death will continue to be investigated
under
questionable and difficult circumstances - for the Kenyan Community in
Alabama and for the local officers who are subject to local pressures.

Please pass this e-mail on to as many people in the community of kind
concerned persons as you can and try to add your voice to any e-mails
you
can send. I thank you in advance for forwarding this and past e-mails
and
for sharing the burden.

Thank you and Peace,

Martin White (Mwangi)

P.S. I apologize if this e-mail is vague with regard to the identities
of
the persons mentioned. However, due to the fact that members of the
Kenyan
Community in Alabama might be further threatened, I have tried to keep
identities vague. However, if you're a bona fide member of the press or
a
human rights organization, upon their permission, I will be happy to
release the names and contact information of those referred to herein.

Attached below are the local press stories and original e-mail:

---------------------------------
The Kenyan community in Alabama will attempt to have a gathering
sometime
this week to discuss how we should proceed in order to ensure that
Catherine Mutheki's death is properly investigated and that no
conclusions
are forced in order to close the case.


3 local Alabama news stories follow from the TimesDaily, Muscle Shoals,
Alabama:

----
Nationwide search on for student
By Mike Goens
Senior Reporter
August 12, 1998

MUSCLE SHOALS - A nationwide search is under way for a native Kenyan who
was last seen walking down the hallway at her Northwest-Shoals Community
College dormitory Sunday afternoon.

Catherine Mutheki, 20, arrived in the Shoals on March 3 and enrolled at
Nortwest-Shoals six days later to begin studying pre-practical nursing,
school officials said.

Until Monday, she had never missed a class, school officials said.

"We're very much concerned because everyone we've talked to has told us
that this is so uncharacteristic of her," said Muscle Shoals Assistant
Police Chief David Bradford. "The folks at the community college are
very
upset because they haven't heard from her."

Mutheki, a native of Nairobi, Kenya, has officially been listed as a
"missing person and endangered," according to Bradford. All local law
enforcement agencies have been notified and Muscle Shoals police have
entered information about her in a national computer center databank.

Melanie Thompson, assistant residence director at Nortwest-Shoals
contacted
Muscle Shoals police just before 11 p.m. Monday about Mutheki's
disappearance.

Bradford said fellow students reported last seeing Mutheki about 1:45
p.m.
Sunday as she was walking down the dor >>

editing a mag can be self serving in two ways i can think of, 1. tenure; 2,
back scratching, maybe if i publish even one of this dullard's poems he'll
publish me in hubblebubble.  Not to mention the sex, to transpose the Tom
Clark axiom, on every little campus there's a poet that'll snap their
pantie elastic at the mere sight of an editor. This works in reverse as
well, if you don't publish this dullard's poems you don't get tenure. Or
you don't get your poems on the billboards if you run readings for five or
ten years and don't invite the dullard poets. Dullards rule ok?

This is a joke, right?

As to the sexual possibilities, may I point out that it would be the most

Two quick requests:
1. Anybody have an email address for Fred Muratori?

2. I'm putting together a selection of uncollected poems by the late poet
and novelist Richard Elman. He was in the habit of sending only copies of
poems to friends. If anyone out there has any such, would you please send
copies to Mark Weiss, PO Box 40537, San Diego CA 92164. His wife Alice and
I have agreed that sending to me would be the best way. I'll make sure that
she gets copies as well.

Why don't "we" just put together a special session at the next MLA? The

suggest the topic of Spicer and Lorca? Anyone interested may back-channel
me.  I am willing to put the thing together. Of course, you have to be a

what fallacy is this ?? the one about me not having to buy into the

one li'l ole pronoun does all that  - in that case i say go for it
...and if all of the sexist people i meet were ever actually take measures
to simply 'avoid the appearance of sexism', while wallowing at night in
their bedrooms full of sexist rage (thinking of me while shouting 'hey

For aspiring and possibly perspiring editors it may be worth pointing out
that the poet's intentions may not be sexual. Even light gauge pantie
elastic -  worn by whatever gender - can take
an eye out.

I should stay out of this he/she fuss but now that Daniel Zimmerman has
been brave enough to expose his unPC-ness, I feel I ought to let it
be known that I back him.  I hate the use of "he or she" myself because
I automatically KNOW that an editor, say, is a he OR her, and am
irritated to be told that by a him-or-herer.  It's exactly why I also
hate the expression "at this point in time."  (Though there are times,
however infrequently, when each expression IS valid.)

I also think it's an insult to women to believe that the use of the
generic "he" will subconsciously force them to believe that all the
vocations it is used with are for men only.

But, like Daniel, I try to avoid problems by using plurals, or "one,"
or second person.

well for what it's worth, i'm with rd and jen h on this, for reasons that would
or could
take a few years to detail...

the question is not whether adding a she/her/hers can do any harm... the
question is rather the ways in which not doing so, for so many centuries,
has already done much harm...

as a teacher i see said harm every day, but am loathe to privilege my own
perspective here... still, i'm actually a bit puzzled---is it possible that
poets, of all people, would not be sensitive to the massive influence the
male pronoun has had in passing itself off as ungendered?...

i suppose this is a rhetorical question, sadly... no ire here, guys (and
gals?)---so please not to jump on my shit... but to see such an elemental
issue rendered ostensibly trivial by presumed association with "political
correctness"---well, makes me wonder whether any of you naysayers have had
even a cursory glance at feminist thought...

or is using the f word (around) here yet another example of pc?...

c'mon... but no hard feelings, just the same...

While we're reforming the language (and in the process erasing its
history), has anybody thought to find better terms than fe-male and wo-man?
Surely we can come up with words that aren't so clearly a product of
patriarchy.

Since I'm leaving town for a couple of weeks I thought I might make a
little mischief.

        Glad to see the Poetry Project (is it Anselm B., really? I think I
saw that in one post) defend Joanne -- don't such exclusions arise from
categories that are too narrow, and which ignore lively, necessary work
because it might not fit someone's conception of avant-garde or experimental
or post-modern? The "old Bolinas crowd" must really be getting old . . .

        I affix the following list of haiku not for their poetic
incisiveness, but solely for cat lovers on the list, whom I'm sure will take
pleasure from them.

         <<FW Ailurophilic Haiku.doc>> (It's a Word 97 document -- if
anyone's interested and can't read it, back-channel me and I'll figure out
another way to send it).

I often wonder about the so-called power of language.  So many
people are offended by name-calling, for instance, but I'm not.  I
think it may be that poets UNDER-RATE the power of words because they
can control them.  Like football players not thinking (mild) physical
violance is harmless because they're used to it.  I've often argued
(with friends) that freedom of speech is not a "natural right," but
something people strong in verbal ability like; I can see the point of
view of those against it, but still choose it myself because information
is important to me.  I don't consider it an absolute good, just a good
that I happen to prefer.  Though I can see their point of view, I think,
it is still hard for me to sympathize with people who are, who claim to
be, victims of words.  And it has to be admitted that there are many who
make a career of offendability.  There's much more to be said on this
topic, but this weak attempt to suggest the gist of my feelings on it, I
hope, will be my last post to this thread.  The subject is too complex
for full discussion, and too sensitive for any kind of easy-going bs
session.

DZ: I agree that *never* using a feminine pronoun demonstrates a pitiful
--even reprehensible--degree of opacity, but I did not even suggest that
particular straw man, nor do I feel responsible to undo the injustices
of the past, since the evils of the present offer such abundant targets.
And in the present, it seems to me that the awkwardification of the
language in the interests of *any* agenda, however laudable [e.g., the
elimination of sexism, which I fully support], makes little sense.

Allow me to explain: I hope that the elimination of sexism will prove a
temporary necessity, i.e., that within a generation or two, sexism will
really cease to exist. However, the ugly modifications to the language
at issue here [whether they actually have any efficacy in eradicating
sexism or not] may stick [heaven forfend!], & not wither away naturally
as Lenin expected the state to do after the dictatorship of the
proletariat [as the Soviet state, for example, certainly did not; it
withered quite unnaturally for thoroughly non-Marxist reasons]. Perhaps
the speakers of English in the future will regard as attractive what I
consider deformities; I think it more likely that they will regard them
as anachronistic, superfluous & unnecessary -- but if they try to make
them 'wither away,' they may find themselves under attack as invidious
reactionaries & revisionists.

Moreover, the notion that gender in the map of language mirrors
sexuality or gender identity in the territory of human life flies in the
face of well established principles of linguistics ["the map is not the
territory"]. To treat them as coextensive strikes me as ludicrous: one
might as well tell the French or Germans to reform the gender of their
nouns [*das" Mädchen, indeed!].

DZ: Joe, I never use "he" in a *poem* as ungendered, but often do so in
speech, and also *always* use "he or she" &c in essay and other writing
*when it seems appropriate* [a possibility which R. M. Daley seems to
think I deny, for reasons I can't discern in my post to which she
responded]. To see a brief example of how I actually *use* pronouns, I
invite you an all listees to read my essay on E-Prime at

http://idt.net/~daniel7

My objection concerns the absolute blanket and obsessive use of multiple
and convoluted instances of double-gendered pronouns in sentence after
sentence by students in my English Comp classes whose highschool
teachers have (*they tell me*) intimidated them into such grotesqueries.

        cuold there be an end to the general posting of files to the List?
My software is not their equal--it's like watching a modest-sized python
swallowing a yak. It takes a long time.

Couldnt the would-be poster of files let the List know they may have one

 Unless we were to go back and edit all older texts so that the "he and
she" appears in place of "he", it would seem that changing to "he" is
more an admission to the change of history than the erasure of it. It
may have made sense, after all, to truncate "he and she" to "he" at that
point where the editorial staff was all male, and it may make sense to
keep it around a while out of convenience, or because we don't believe
that the women are going to take over after all.  But they are now, or
they did;  they've got the better corpus collosum and they'll take over
the writing and editorial positions.  "He" has become to seem more like
nothing more than a nostalgic anachronism. . ."Back in the days of
Yore.  He"

But then. . .I'm relatively young, so "he and she" seems natural
enough.  It takes me the same or less cognitive juice to process as "he"
since we don't really READ it anyway.  But I can appreciate what people
say about awkwardness.  I can appreciate how trivial the attempt to
change the language seems in light of other problems. Pronouns aren't a
particularly interesting part of speech, after all.  Pronoun USAGE is
interesting, but pronouns themselves are placeholders or shorthand.  If
we were really interested in what the pronoun specified, we wouldn't
have said "he and she" to begin with.  We would have give names or said
"the editor" or "editors".   So it can seem rude to be corrected on the
shorthand and have the substance of the sentence ignored.  It can seem
that usages like "she and he" are more cute than effective, and "womyn"
for "women" is, well, a bold dramatic statement made at an undramatic
juncture.

But an insult to women?  Where did THAT emotive response come from?
Maybe the disembodied campaign to change the pronouns is disconcerting
(the "PC" doesn't actually exist after all. . . there isn't a center for
it, or a document, and its agents pass from person to person like the
angel in "fallen". . . recognizeable only by a few phrases that sound as
if they are coming from someone else) but I can't think of actual
instances where the pronouns would be taken as insulting.   And if  this
insult was a result of that larger context then. . .hmmm. . . wouldn't
one want to change the culture instead of adjusting the pronoun to be
even handedly sexist?  Or change the text?  After all, I think "he and
she" looks more natural in some contexts than it does in other.  It
would look downright peculiar in Norman Mailer.  So perhaps if the "he
and she" in our own texts look like too much of a hat tip to the PC,
than maybe the rest of the text is the problem, not the new pronouns.

Shrug.

How does language change?  Complex pressure of social forces plus art, in
part. I remember when "Negro" changed to "Black" after the confluence of
hundreds of cities going up in smoke and James Brown "Black and Proud."
Blind acceptance of universal "he" has been correctly challenged on a mass
scale -- the publisher of my current book sent me guidelines on how to
avoid gender-narrow language: amazing!  It's a welcome change -- but one
that is awkward because of the way that history -- negative as well
as positive -- embeds social relations in English.  Sometimes we can let
the history of domination and violence embedded in language slide --
sometimes not.  It all depends.  There really has been no tremendous
difficulty in developing the use of "lettercarrier" or "flight attendant;"
certainly no problem in "poet" and dropping "poetess," etc.  Still, the
him/her and other constructions tend to be ugly, clumsy, awkward.  After
time new constructions may develop (just as "you" supplanted earlier
"thou").  "They" used "incorrectly" may prove correct.  In perverse moods,
I advocate using "it," since I'm not convinced humans need to regard
themselves as anything better than or separate from inanimate objects:
"It hit 70 home runs this year!  What a year it had!"

Now David, that's an interesting piece of history embedded in language. For
reasons not obvious to me straw figures used to scare birds away from crops
are almost always male, although the humans who served that role were
usually children of both genders. "Straw Woman" is almost exclusively a
modern commercial development (I remember dimly a Hollywood dance number
with a straw couple). Snow folk are also interesting. It's almost always a
man.

Sad news tonight : Dick Higgins passed away yesterday. He was a major
figure in a complex set of art & poetry crossovers — poet, composer,
painter, translator and art theorist, he was involved early on with
happenings and was a core member of Fluxus — defining what came to be
known by his own term of "intermedia." Of himself he said: "I find I
never feel quite complete unless I'm doing all the arts--visual, musical
and literary. I guess that's why I developed the term 'intermedia,' to
cover my works that fall conceptually between these." As founder of
Something Else Press he published works by Alan Kaprow, Gertrude Stein,
Marshall McLuhan, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Emmett Williams, and Ray
Johnson among others. His forty-seven books include _foew&ombwhnw_
(something else press), _Poems Plain & Fancy_ (Station Hill Press) and
_A Book About Love & War & Death_ (Something Else). He edited and
annotated Giordano Bruno's_ On the Composition of Images, Signs & Ideas
_(Willis, Locker & Owens), as well as the marvellous anthology _ Pattern
Poetry : Guide to an Unknown Literature_ (SUNY Press).

Leonard Brink asks:
"How is promoting others at ones own expense of time, money, energy, and
ones own work as "self-serving" as submitting poems to be published at
someone else's expense of time, money, energy and work?"

leonard, i'm thinking less in terms of economic than symbolic capital.
the editor of a fine mag should receive as much distinction as the
contributor of a fine poem.  any practice can thus be seen as geared
towards the accumulation and maintainance of one's own symbolic capital
and hence be considered self-serving.

I don't want to be difficult here, but there are serious issues with
pronouns; it's not that difficult to use she/he, he or she, one, or
alternate them - when you teach in art school and both female and male
students are trying to find their (that plural) own identity through their
work - and when sexism is still deeply embedded in the artworld - making
those changes - which are admittedly often awkward and noticable and
therefore politicizing/empowering - can make a real difference in how a
male or female student views his or her potential for an arts career. I've
seen far too many male circles around male teachers, far too many quiet
exclusionisms etc. I'm not arguing for PC by the way - which I hate -
but sensitivity. Language can go a long way towards that.

Say Tom, I have a few grand of symbolic capital right on the floor next

be willing to give you a cut on the symbolic capital I'll get from the

This is very upsetting; Something Else has been a huge influence in my
life - Spoerri's work for example, Higgins' energy, the early artists'
books, the Merce Cunningham work - all of it. Higgins was everywhere; I
never knew what to make of that end of fluxus, and still don't. I also
felt he deserved a whole lot more credit than he received. An Anecdoted
Topography of Chance (Spoerri) was my favorite artist book. All of
Spoerri's work makes me think... And Something Else had a resonance about
it - they published people like Benjamin Patterson, who should also have
been better known.

Yes, very sad--and unexpected--the news about Dick Higgins.  He was
"only" a phone&letter friend of mine but his death has put a significant
void into my life.  He was an ever-decent, supportive and hugely
talented man.  More branches of the arts than even he was aware of will
miss him.

People have been yammering away about ugly modifications to the language
(English! Irish! French! Turkish! To name my few) for a long time now
and all they ever succeed in doing is coming off like major cranks and
stick-in-the-muds.  I speak of YOU Daniel Zimmerman. What IS all this
stuff about *deformity,* and *withering away,* and *grotesqueries*?  I see
language as a dirty big glacier that is inexorable, quite immune to your
yapping. Avaunt she and he and his and her!  You buffalos with
your stumbling over pronouns and one hundred names for the gap between
words and how many angels can dance on the point of a pin, you fusty
"experimentalists"!

I was reading through the MLA guide to non-sexist usage to see if it could
be of help on this issue.  A lot of the examples in the book tended to be
from bureaucratese, so it struck me that 90% of the problem was in phrases
in which some "general rule" was proposed--the well-known false universal
of "everyone should eat his vegetables" or "the tenure candidate should
make sure to kiss his chair's butt."  In my own critical writing the
problem usually only surfaces in  phrases about "the reader," which I try
to avoid anyway.  Other than that I am always thinking about some specific
he or she.  The he or she in hypothetical examples gives them an air of
vagueness.  Yet if *one* uses she, and the hypothesis is negative, one
exposes oneself to charges of sexism: "the editor, with her ink-stained
hands and fatuous air, deliberatlely introducing typos into the work of
hapless avant-garde poets..."

There is a poem by Juliana Spahr that uses the bureaucratic "he or she"
to good poetic effect.  I think I could have read it in Chicago Review
recently.

thanks to everyone who replied to me concerning server space
and everyone who offered space or had suggestions
for now, howver, I have decided to re-sign with Univ.at Buffalo
under the stewardship of Loss Glazier, general manager of the
EPC and many other domania there.

When I first went to New York, I knew it was right for me.
The people really made me feel welcome there.

*

I've been following the debates here without disciplined regu-hilarity
and wanted to inject a thought into the talk. someone mentioned cultural
capital as an aspect of publishing. and it is clear to me how being a
publisher generates capital (both symbolic and real). And while i have
certainly feasted on the lush life of grandiosity and excess generated
by my super-status as a small press publisher, and despite the endless
favors of publication, travel, money, sports-tickets, whathaveyou, and
aside from the public recognition I receive on the streets of Spring
Valley and from my co-workers at the office (who otherwise just thought
of me as someone *only* sitting near the edge of his rocker), I can tell
you there is nothing to it. I would gladly give this all up for a little
happiness.

The concept of cultural capital here makes me nervous, not because I
don't believe that it exists, but because it seems to me that to
complain about capital *here* in a scene rife with unacknowledged or
unrecognized symbolic or cultural capital is a little ridiculous.

But that said, it makes me nervous that I would have this capital, or
that by operating in a network productive of said capital, I might be
unaware of its effects.

I'm thinking that there has to be a way to destroy some of this excess
capital without getting into sublime waste or without seeming so
ultimately bourgeois, and the only way that I've figured that one can do
it would be to make mistakes, lots of them. Let people down and
disappoint them and then suddenly the world is your conch shell. You can
hear the crowd roaring from one thousand million miles away. You can
hear them from the lockerroom. My back hurts.

I'm off to operate heavy machinery as part of a deal I made with the
State of California...

jk

p.s. some back channel talk of a "chapbook union" or organization to
help with the distribution and to further solidfy trade routes in back
waters and offshore islands. Any ideas on this out there?

WHERE ARE THEY NOW? Number two

FIVE POEMS------


The praise of death falls
light as
light on flowers. We are
comfortable, warm
and certain as the night
of cause and plan. The hand
that trembles
trembles like a fan, the bones
wake out of it. She shuts the door the
flowers die. It all so
lightly shakes.


--------------------

Sweet light snow
flakes smiling people
crush under
foot. The gangster is
dead and fallen on
flowers. Hand slices three
hours snow off the wind
screen all down
night sky.


-------------------------------


N.A.B.

Cold morning in the white
room. Old man
blowing plumes of pipe
smoke rose
and blue. We are all waiting
for money.


--------------------------

Marrakech they're off
to. Well
forget the star
coat but try for red. You'll
come home tanned and sleep three
days, see you by
the river? (Fleurs
du mal, advisedly.)

----------------------------

Rose hips
in the bowl. This
found or
left, enough, making
no demands. My bones
sing hard melody.



----------------------------

These poems are by Ray Crump, and were written circa 1968. He was at the
time a student at Cambridge and that's just about all I know about him. He
knew J.H.Prynne and may have studied under him. He contributed poems like
these to The English Intelligencer, Collection, The Park and probably other
magazines of that time.  He knew a London poet called Geoffrey Hazard and
in 1968 they planned a magazine together called Little Wren, which never
appeared. There was no collection, though about two years later I did see
in Better Books a small book by him  published by an obscure American small
press, which I foolishly didn't buy.  Perhaps he went to the States.

I've got my own typescript collection of about 60 of these poems and three
short sequences, some unpublished.  They're mostly short and stuttery like
these, with very short and/or broken lines. They don't all have the
epiphanic concentration of these, some are plainer (like the third here),
some are beset with strangely literary terms like "'twas".  Perhaps a lot
of them don't come off at all. But there's something unique about these
little pieces at their best, a unique way of cutting abstracts and symbolic
fragments into that calm pseudo-oriental short-line pastoral daze, and I
thought his handling of line-end could be very skillful.

I don't suppose anybody knows.....

I'll repeat this on Poetry Etc. (I don't normally approve of such
doublings) because although it's an issue of British poetry if he did go to
the States somebody somewhere out there might....

Yes, Spahr is one of the few poets doing work that is highly aware of the
huge range of contemporary bureaucratic, journalistic, academic, etc.
argots that do so much to structure the contemporary verbal surround.

This strikes me as rather remarkable.  (It seems like more poets ought to
be aware of and responsive to these midgecloud cluster langpro
phenomena....)

It also strike me, that it is **perfectly OK** for speakers and writers to
use nonsexist constructions.  Even laudable.  These days (when all you
ever hear is crypto-rightist sneers about how everything and its mother is
"pc") it bears repeating that its OK to hate sexism... (You wdn't really
think so, from most of the oh-so-amusing jabs being telegraphed here..)

It also strikes me, that it is **almost exclusively men** who have been
yukkin' it up in such a self-congradulatory mood, about how nonsexist
usage is bad....

Does this maybe tell us something??

In response and deference to Henry Gould, it seems to me that "elf" neglects the juicy and invigoratingly brutal history of
the language, opting instead for a specious inscription of its cuter side.

My own suggestion, after years of wrestling with the pronomial Muse (whoa! back up--she's just one of the guys!) is "hissic,"
or perhaps "hisic." This is an abbreviated form of the tendency I think the language has been assuming for the past twenty
years or so, as in:


> "The conscientious editor is a self-flagellating goody-goody who loves all gooey writing and does his [sic] best to publish
> the best out there."

dan, permit me to be a bit pedantic... there's a book---mayhap the source
for the guidelines hilton's publisher sent him---_language, gender, and
professional writing: theoretical approaches and guidelines for nonsexist
usage_, ed. by paula treichler and francine w. frank... came out in 1989,
and so covers much of this issue from a slightly dated perspective... but a
quick way to get up to speed c. 1989...

which is another way of saying that i don't think we're up to speed yet,
culturally speaking, in part thanx to the various backlashes of the 90s..

there IS so much more to say here, and this is one of those times when my
motivations in arguing for a different approach to pronouns are
underwritten by (again and again) feminist thinking on the matter... as
opposed, say, to concerns over consequent "style"... no point in my citing
more texts---suffice to say there are any number that seem to me to
communicate the urgency of such ostensibly "simple" controversies as 'she
rather than he'... and by "texts" i include of course the various
submissions by students i've had the pleasure of eyeballing closely over
the last decade...

i like bog g's notion that poets may in some sense be insensitive to
language---insofar as poets may be willing, say, to fracture a few
phonemes... but insofar as poets don't or won't COMPREHEND the s/he issue
as potentially complex and far-reaching---well, not very poetic of them!...
in any case, the issue turns, again, on what one is hoping to achieve
through one's words (albeit we may not always have clear intentions)... and
for me, wrt this issue, there are some clearcut political benefits to
advocating greater awareness of pronominal usage, and altering our habits
accordingly when it comes to specific language practices...

and to cut down on my posting, on another thread:  sad news indeed re dick
higgins... admittedly my only exchange with him was in *these* spaces, and
we didn't quite see eye to eye... but there's no doubt as to the value of
his work, and i wish i could have had the chance to meet him ftf, try to
iron out our differences over a handshake...

best,

joe

'"They" used "incorrectly" may prove correct.'  So says Hilton Obenzinger.
Ursula K, Le Guin also said, when reconsidering her use of 'he' & 'his' in
_The Left Hand of Darkness_, 'until the sixteenth century the English
generic singular pronoun was they/them/their, as it sill is in English and
American colloquial speech. It should be restored to the written language,
and let the pedants and pundits squeak and gibber in the streets.' I now
allow this usage. Why not? A friend simply shifts from he to she from one
paragraph to the next. Another way of dealing with the problem?

Funny how some people find changes to language in terms of pronoun
consideration too awkward, disturbing, debilitating, false & culturally
violent, yet let the tactically, right-wing ideologically coined &

Yes the new Shearsman is out.   And very welcome it is too.

Just glancing through:

_A Vignette_ by Karin Lessing  ... "a swallow's // wings / ignite, grace //
of their passing // over us, through, us, who are / forms of air ..."

and four poems by Martin Corless-Smith including _Two Stanzas Concerning
the Physical nature of Language_ ...
"Seen after a Bright sky
Light the black writings green
Before I understood this place
All I wanted was a garden (scene)

this paper linen gjrass or fruitless weeds
on my own dust mere dust it is
In slow letters of light
A place and no more is set down"

(BTW did anyone else catch Martin's excellent interview with Ric Caddel in
the latest Denver Quarterly?)

Not to mention a fine slab of a new poem by Billy Mills _What is a
Mountain?_

I've still to read Simon Perchik's _Four Poems_
Peter Robinson's three poems, (I really like the stanza length sentences,
lovely syntax)
Matthew Mead and Ian Davidson

and congratulations to Trevor Joyce on getting such a fine notice of
_Syzygy_.

Shearsman is available from Tony Frazer, 47 Dayton Close, Plymouth PL6 5DX,
England. (e-mail: tfrazer@df1.telmex.net.mx)

A couple days ago I posted on Peter Gizzi's new book, _The
House that Jack Built_, and made mention of his afterword, a really
magnificent essay on Spicer's poetics. When writing is good,
sometimes it makes you want to argue, and so here is something Gizzi
says that I would have an argument with, as one can have an argument
with anything:

"Through his practice of dictation and waiting, Spicer creates orphic
gaps in the surface of his poems, and every time we read a gap we
fall, like Orpheus, into the poem's underworld. When we fall through
and into the poem, we enact our struggle to make meaning. We light up
with various potential meanings, like pinball machines."

But I would say to Gizzi if he were listening that readers are not
pinball machines. In a materialist poetics like Spicer's, it is the
poem that is the pinball machine, and every shake of the box, every
pull of the knob, every flipper flip, every thrust of the hip and
head the poet makes to get the ball to bounce and go where it should,
is written from the beginning into each pinball poem. Balls behave
differently every time. They are crazy. The ball pops up and  goes
fast into the poem. Bounce, bounce, bing, bing, but every different
game is preordained. The poet ghost knows this but he has to play and
play, as if he were in Hell.

The reader is the ball. Balls can be bumped and flipped to where
they should go, and sometimes they bounce and careen like madcaps to
score big points, and sometimes they fall into a gap and are gone or
fall into a light-ringed hole and pop back out, making
bells go ding and bodiless voices speak or sing. Sometimes the
machine lights up like a town, but for the most part it doesn't.
Whether it does or it doesn't is of absolutely no concern to the
reader, who is simply a ball. Each pinball machine is connected to
every other pinball machine. There are a lot of pinball machines in
Hell.

Maybe, anyway. But do check out this fine book.

    But, I'd argue that there are a number of games/credits/events
surrounding the production of a poem: the first listening, editing,
publishing, reading, re-reading, etc.  Each time a quarter is put in and
a game is played, the identification with the various parts of the
pinball metaphor changes.

    I'd venture to say that Spicer was the ball, and his ghosts bumped
around and flashed and lit up and spun him around.  It seems that his
patient waiting allowed the poem to play a darn good game with him,
possibly even winning him extra credits.  (And, I'd say, we are the
receivers of these free games.  I know I've played a few games, courtesy
of Mr. Spicer...)

    The reader _can_ be the ball, if they come to the poem empty, and
open.  But, mostly, everyone comes with their own game design,
inevitably changing the psychic shape of the poem with their own memory,
history, and predisposition.  What's the better way to produce a poem
when we read it?  I don't know...

There is a panel on Robert Duncan at the 98 MLA.  He did, I believe,
have some connection with the San Francisco Renaissance. Panel 181, on
Monday, December 28, 8:30 to 9:45 A.M., Parlor 9 of the Continental
Ballroom, in the Hilton. Panelists include David Bromige, Robert
Bertholf, and Devin Johnston.  Also some people on this list might be
interested to know that there will be a poetry reading at the '98 MLA,
with Leslie Scalapino, Lyn Hejinian, and David Bromige.  Monday,
December 28, 5:15-6:30, Franciscan Room A of the Hilton. And some of
you might be interested in the George Oppen panel (#460) on Tuesday,
December 29, 8:30-9:45 A.M., in the Franciscan Room A of the Hilton.
Panelists are Alan Golding, Gwyn McVay, Burt Kimmelman, and me.   All
three events were proposed by yours truly, and were organized primarily
through this Poetics list, which proved a dandy way of pulling together
some like-minded people on short notice.

I note that the MLA poetry reading featuring Bromige, Hejinian and
Scalapino is scheduled for the same time as the Cash Bar "arranged by the
Division on Poetry."  In the interest of avoiding divisions, and seeing
that these two events are only a floor apart in the San Francsico Hilton, I
propose that volunteers organize a bucket brigade to communicate between
the two rooms.

Subject:      why Althusser shot his wife
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The title of a book I saw in a book-store, "Why Althusser shot his wife,
and other essays," got me thinking about the category of
"disqualification," by which I mean the mental habit of dismissing,
whether with justification or not, on the basis of some trigger* being
pulled. I find I am prone to doing this. When I saw the title of this book
I thought "boy, that might "disqualify" him for some feminists."

My colleague's accent in Spanish makes me wince.  The discovery of Paul de
Man's war-time writing disqualifies 'deconstruction' in retrospect. A
professor in college (poet whose gender I will not name) tells me WCW is a
bad influence.  The color-blind art-critic, barber with bad haircut,
etc...

These disqualifications can obviously be unjust, ad hominem, or
irrelevant.  But they have a certain inexorable logic I find hard to
resist at times.

When Walter Benjamin says that no poem, finally, is intended for the
reader, I think he's right. Intending, understanding,
feeling, meaning, it's all the bells and whistles of all the pinball

Well, precisely. It matters not a teeny bit what is in the ball. For
example: baseballs, superballs, tennis balls, bowling
balls, cricket balls, medicine balls, testicle balls (these are
reportedly used in certain pinball games of the underworld), squash
balls, croquet balls, all of these can, theoretically, be used in
versions of pinball.

Look Hassen, when you read the _Heads of the Town up to the
Aether_ you are a ball. I am a ball. He is a ball. She is a ball. We
are balls.

Spicer rattles and curses the glowing machine.

And of course it's preordained. Otherwise you have to believe the
poem exists for you, that it's "out there," separate from you. Do you
think it makes me happy, _feeling_ like I'm free in the poem,
_knowing_ my whole life as a ball is plotted out for me by all the
phoneme-wires of Hell?

(before I said I really didn't know for sure, but now I've
changed my mind.)

Look at me. I'm not laughing.

well, i'm a feminist and i find the title intriguing.  perhaps it is,
like Mary Wilkins Freeman's "The Revolt of Mother," or Brownings "My
Last Duchess," or Susan Glaspell's "A Jury of Her Peers" a subversive
narrative by virtue of what it leaves out, and/or implies.

maybe it is an analysis of the murder of a woman such that one woman's
murder at the hands of a domestic partner is not dismissed but
discussed.

maybe it is funny -- a wierd, ridiculous story ala james thurber that ends
in some unlikely event that causes althusser to shoot his wife... (yes,
feminists CAN have a sense of humor).

or maybe it is awful.  if i see it in a bookstore, i'll report.

re disqualification, i've had (and reported in the past) the same theory
for some time -- there are so many texts out there now, due in part to
historical accretion and in part to widespread dissemination of reading
and writing skills that a large body of lit crit and theory is, in fact,
aimed at dismissing whole bodies of text so that critics/theorists/hapless-
students-of-same who feel overburdened won't have to READ them all!

There may be no panels on Spicer at this year's MLA Convention in SF
(when, by the way, has there ever been), but in my quick perusal of the
conference schedule, I noticed that there's an interesting (to me) panel
on The Poetics of Robert Duncan (#181, Monday, 28 December at 8:30 am),
chaired by Burt Hatlen, and with papers by Bob Bertholf, David Bromige
(hi! David), and Devin Johnston.

Not really a celebration of the SF Renaissance, but it will have to do.

Many on this list seem to find my comments about the use of
dual-gendered pronouns hopelessly naive. Please enlighten me:

Does the failure of writers in the past to use 'nonsexist'
he/she dual-gendered pronouns qualify them retroactively as
'sexist,' or as unconscious 'victims' of sexism?

Do present writers who consciously decline, for aesthetic
[or any; which?] reasons to use such constructions automatically
qualify as 'sexist' or as 'inflictors' of sexism? Or do they
deserve to have readers suspect them of sexism on that basis alone?

Shelley called poets "the unacknowledged legislators of the world."
I'd like to think so, but I'll bet they'd legislate a lot less
if some modern Bowdler s/he'd all the works of the poets to whom PBS
referred, & all those since! How many poets on this POETICS [remember?]
list use s/he-oidisms in their *poetry*?

"All men are created equal," the Declaration says. We all know how
unfairly and restrictively the Framers construed the term "men," but why
change it to "men and womyn"? Why not, instead, recognize that the term
"all" has begun to come into the fullness of its meaning?

In matters such as these, I prefer the Sapphic injunction -- "don't
disturb the rubble" (later incarnated in the Sufic principle, "don't
strike at the face") -- to the Bowdlerization of the past, present, or
future. Bowlder's redaction sacrificed beauty to ideological & 'moral'
purity, as I believe the present huffing & puffing about pronouns also
seeks to do. It seems a perverse attempt to change the content of
people's characters by modifying the color of their skins.

Respectfully,

This for me is extremely interesting - is Plato sexist for example; was
George Washington racist? These contemporary terms are applied to past
domains (socius, environment, culture, nation - all these terms are
problematic), where they become the focus of projections of current dis-
course. Many native American groups "kept slaves" for example - but what
does _slave_ mean in this context? All of these terms are over-determined
for us; retroactive application can be another form of colonizing.

It depends on "automatic" here; what's called for is sensitivity, not
a transcendent positioning.

I do or at least work consciously with gender. Your calling up a "modern
Bowdler" is a bit of a red herring; no one is calling for censorship.

Because you can use "all men" to refer to "all males," and "all women"
to refer to "all females"; there's no fullness - it's a modifier here.

Again, no one is calling for PC I think, again, just sensitivity. I know
it _does_ make a difference in the classroom, and at least in my own work,
it makes a difference as well. But then I choose it to.

Epitaph, Pretty Party Dress


Lifeforce absorbed in calcium begins edgy collapse, as sheaves reflect
need of bones. Once I walked these shores. Now memory serves potassium
interference; collapse is. Once I thought memory would serve me. That is
when I walked lake bed, picked stones, lived in cool light of Providence.
You must think energy energy. Absorption beats up on foolish words. Stones
continue centering of language. What I need, your drug. Veins stretched
out in thundering skies. I want to go to your dance with all you. I want
to bring my friends on what means. There are many talking. I need to know
talking. Sometime now I will in silence die. Calcium stone will fall and
failing building. Now I will tell time to all who listen. So loose energy,
need your party now. Party-club-dance.

I wanna see you in your new party dress.
I wanna see you in your new party dress.
I wanna crowd around. I wanna crowd around.
Let's have fun for me cause I'll be there for the fun of merry fun.
Let's have merry fun for good and sparkling talk and sound of drug.
Let me play for you. Let me play for you.
I wanna crowd around you. I wanna crowd around.
So listen party-club-dance in the pretty-party-dress!
Lemme loosen up! Let's have merry fun!

Dear Poetics:

I find this discussion interesting since for years I have been threatening
to write a history of my native Los Angeles entitled _THANK GOD COLONEL
GRIFFITH SHOT HIS WIFE IN THE HEAD!_. The title refers to the fact
that we Angelenos only have a big chunk of centrally located park
land (Griffith Park) because one day an inebriated and delusional Colonel
Griffith thought that his wife of many years (a lovely dark-eyed beauty
from one of the original Spanish familes) was trying to poison him as part
of a Roman Catholic plot.  Apparently Colonel Griffith wasn't a very good
shot compared to celebrated wife-killers like Althusser and Burroughs and
Muybridge.  Senora Griffith clambered out the window with a bullet wound
in her skull and Griffith subsequently mollified the city fathers by
turning over a huge chunk of land.  My question: who's wife was shot so
that New Yorkers could have Central Park?

Of course Althusser did not shoot his wife, he smothered her with a pillow --
a procedure which clearly doesn't make as attractive a title for US
consumption than the all-american shoot-out (at theory corral).

Uhhh..maybe i was always under the wrong impression; but didn't LA

Is this a bit of pomo postmythicizing, pulling our postlegs, on the part

I recalled it as strangling.  Anyway, searching for more information, I
searched for Althusser on Yahoo and got the following URL:
http://www.cyber-nation.com/victory/quotations/authors/quotes_althusser_louis.html

This page features the LA quote,

"Ideology has very little to do with "consciousness" -- it is profoundly
unconscious."

Cyber Nation, as it turns out, is a success motivation web site, the
mission of which is "To Provide YOU And Your Family With Powerful And
Unique Tools And Products To Improve And Enhance All Aspects Of Your
Life... And To Inspire And Empower You To Achieve Your Dreams And
Destiny."

The Althusser quote above is one of many "Great quotes to inspire, empower
and motivate you to live the life of your dreams and become the person
you've always wanted to be!"  Among the other quotes under "ideology" is
the following by V.I. Voloshinov (or Bakhtin, whatever):

"Everything ideological possesses meaning: it represents, depicts, or
stands for something lying outside itself. In other words, it is a sign.
Without signs there is no ideology."

This strikes me as hilarious -- Tony Robbins reading _Marxism and the
Philosophy of Language_.

David

Have you checked your pronouns lately, Kent "boy"?  J checked hers
only AFTER she wrote the Bible - don't make the same mistake.  Have
you been diddling away your precious time writing "she & he"?  Or
comparing Lovecraft Cult notes on literary stranglings?  (Happy
Halloween, you mandarin dolt perverts out there)  - Henry Ghould

re MLA: A Pitch to the Crowd:

I was nominated to stand for election to the executive committee of the
Division on Poetry this year. So, if you have not yet cast your ballots, why
not vote for me. Get a further list-member on that committee, and at the
minimum I promise to organize that bucket brigade Aldon is clammering for at
future events -- & at the max, I'll try to do my best to avoid such double
dates. Inbetween the min & the max there a lot else that can be done. See
(some of)  you in San Francisco.

Laura gave me a good idea.  Why not just a shit?  For example, "The Poet,
whatever shit's class, race, shoe size or lyric gift, must necessarily, at
this late stage of the Twentieth Century be responsible at least for
shit's own typos, hairdos, gaps between front teeth and gaps between
words.  Shit MUST give a shit.

Hello Charles!
Some Lipstick shall be sent your way this week Thank you!
Thanks also for info re: Sac State. I'm trying to find out what the
"climate" in the department is like in relation to experimental poetics
and teaching poetry in general, what sorts of students one encounters
there (in grad and undergrad progs.) Could you fill me in a bit on
Dennis Schmitz? I'm afraid I'm not familiar with his work.
Lipstickly yours,
Kathy Lou

All this talk about editors and whatnot has me wondering if there is any
mailing list or website that has an ongoing conversation about
copyediting, usage, etc.
For instance, if I had a specific question that I needed answered rather
quickly or maybe I just wanted to debate the use of certain punctuation,
well I'm sure you know what I mean...
Any resources?

For us non-MLAers, does anyone have info on how to register for the

information--even though a prominent, sexy link promises such. But, gee,
why would a Web site have any USEFUL info?

Much appreciated.

Let me sound like a "school" (skool) teacher here--
but gosh--I went away for a weekend and came back to
178 messages from the list! MOST had no conversational tone to
them--MOST were really e-------------mails--which required only a

I have to admire the ambition here. Assuming there is no discount at all
for the lifetime subscription, then the $1000 charge means that The Hat
projects a publishing lifetime of more than 83 years -- not to mention that
the lifetime subscriber also hopes to live at least 83 more years.

And I thought longevity and stability were old values, washed away into the
crevasses of post-industrial society's shifting centers of identity and
meaning. You renew my faith in American stick-to-it-iveness.

To defend the list... while there is always too much 'noise' on the
channel, where else can I find 500 people as knowledgable and obsessed
about poetry as I am?  "Poetics" has put me in contact with old friends,
helped me make new ones by back-channel, and provided high-powered
discussion of important issues.

I can hardly criticize people who post too much, being one of the worst
offenders, but I would like to hear more from the silent majority...

*** British Lord's ashes fired off in cannon

LONDON (Reuters) - The ashes of an eccentric British peer were fired
from an 18th century cannon to their final resting place - a wooded
copse on his country estate. The 7th Lord Newborough, a war hero with
a colorful past, left his son specific instructions about his offbeat
farewell. His heir duly obliged on the family's Denbighshire estate,
firing his ashes in a steel canister. The cannon burst briefly into
flames and rolled down a hill but safely propelled the ashes into the
copse. "I think my father would have allowed himself a wry smile,"
the 8th Lord Newborough told the Daily Telegraph newspaper after the
parting shot. ###

Oh yeah? Well, speaking for myself... Since I joined"Poetics" about
two years ago, I have pissed-off and lost the only "old friend" that
was on the List to begin with, made most people hate me (though I
seem to have come in at a disadvantage from the get-go), made
one or two acquaintances back-channel who soon stopped writing me,
and driven myself continuously crazy trying to follow the esoteric
and high-powered discussion of ultimately meaningless issues.

But I love being here.

        I for one dont hate you, Kent Johnson,--I am very glad to have made
yr e-quaintance, and even if you did bump me on the court once or twice,
you have given me some good games. I admire both your post, and Jonathan
Mayhew's, for its balanced evaluation of this List, which, let me testify,
galvanized my life during the early months I was on it. Yeah, I'm a bit
jaded now, more inclined to find fault with it,--I miss the whacky humor of
2 years ago, for instance,-- but there is so much that is positive about
it, and its better than 50 newspapers.

I know I posted 5 times in one day recently, but I have let days go by w/o
posting once, and will try to sin no more. (Am _I_ Mo?)

+ + + + + +

For us few older codgers on this List, the news of Ted Hughes'
demise--whatever we think of his poetry--must set that old "Exit" sign
flashing again. He was just recently arrived when we came in, and--in the
twinkling of a moment, a mere 4 decades--gone. Timor mortis conturbat me.
It's a clear blue day here in NoCal.   David

Poet Ted Hughes dies

Ted Hughes: Kept his illness a secret


One of Britain's most admired literary
figures, the Poet Laureate, Ted
Hughes, has died aged 68.

Mr Hughes died peacefully at his
home in Devon after an 18-month
battle with cancer that he had kept secret from all but
those very close to him.

The writer was named Poet Laureate
in 1984 and was widely acclaimed for
the intense images he evoked of the
English countryside and the savagery
of the animal world.

The Queen and the prime minister
were among the first to express their condolences.

Mr Hughes made his final public appearance at a private
audience with the Queen 13 days ago, when she
presented him with the Order of Merit.

An official spokesman at Buckingham Palace said: "She
was grateful for the opportunity to recognise his work
and achievements, before he died, through the award of
the Order of Merit."

Tony Blair called Mr Hughes a "towering figure in
20th-century literature", and said the poet's contribution
to the body of great British poetry was immense.

Although famed for his dark imagery of the British
countryside, the poet was also renowned in literary
history for his marriage to American poet Sylvia Plath.


Their stormy relationship
dogged his reputation after
she committed suicide in
February 1963, soon after he
left her for another woman.

A collection of poems
published by Hughes this
year, Birthday Letters, shed
new light on his difficult
marriage and brought him
sympathy along with rave
reviews.

He was awarded a £10,000 Forward Poetry prize for the
collection earlier in October.

He said in a message read out at the
awards by his editor Christopher Reid:
"My book Birthday Letters is a
gathering of the occasions - written
with no plan over about 25 years - in
which I tried to open a direct, private, inner contact with
my first wife, not thinking to make a poem, thinking
mainly to evoke her presence to myself and to feel her
there listening."

The reclusive Hughes had chosen not to defend himself
against a storm of abuse from fans of Sylvia Plath, some
of whom branded him a murderer after her suicide.

The poet made few public
appearances and, until the publication
of Birthday Letters, made no
comment on his six-year marriage.

But the poems showed that although he remarried, he
had never stopped thinking about Sylvia Plath.

Kept tightly under wraps with none of the fanfare usually
accorded publishing events, it came as a complete
surprise to the literary world.
Hughes' death will come as a similar surprise to many.

When I left Cornell College in Iowa last Spring to take a new post out
East, I felt an immenses sense of relief to unsubscribe from the poetics
listserv and to terminate my email account--so many unread messages
clogging up the poetic drain. After a break, however, I'm happy to log
back on and catch snippets of Ted Hughes death, Interlope #2, and
social anathematic fall out! As a poet who reads Talisman in one hand
and The Yale Review in the other, I have always been interested in the
conversations that manage to bridge the aesthetic abyss of our poetry at
century's end (the way W.W. Norton is to Burning Deck as Dover once
was to Calais.).

Hats off to Coffee House Press for publishing the selected Kenward
Elmslie. I had been reading the new poems in the last couple of issues in
New American Writing and was so happy to find ROUTINE DISRUPTIONS
faced-out on the shelves at St. Marks. From poets like Elaine Equi to
Linda Hogan, Coffee House seems to have reached out to many camps.

1) somebody was asking about MLA conference registration -- the date to get
the lower rate by mail is now long past -- which means it's easiest simply
to register at the conference itself -- but the steep price is daunting --
there IS a lower rate for students,,,, also daunting would be the prospect
of trying to find a hotel room at this late date --

BUT, there are several sessions open to the public -- I think they're
identified in the on-line version of the program (since they are in the
printed version)

the reading by Bromige, Hejinian & Scalapino IS among the events open to
the public for free -- the panel I'm on is not one of the free sessions,
and I am sure that will cause no end of pain to everybody on this list --


2) a footnote to the comments about judging past personages by present
standards etc -- I think anybody who'd read much of George Washington's
writing would have to agree that he was a racist -- but more importantly,
the question raised about judging the likes of the father of our country by
today's standard's usually betrays a significant narrowing of what might
stand as a standard IN the past -- for example, what did Africans in
America think about the question?  Phillis Wheatley gives us one set of
answers,,,, there are others -- My point is simply that the argument that
we might attempt to understand the thinking of Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin
Franklin from the viewpoint of their contemporaries isn't such a bad idea
in itself, but is generally put forward by people who do not, in fact,
include enough of those contemporaries in their construction of the past
standards --


3)  Hi, Todd -- how's the old caesura doing?

4)  generally no real need for "he or she" or the reprehensible "s/he" --
nine times out of ten the issue can be addressed by a plural address (Oh,
why didn't the parents of our mother tongue bless us with a neuter
pronoun?) -- for example, instead of "The writer should observe his or her
pronominal imperatives,"  why not "Writers should mind their Ps & Qs."

Here's a (vaguely related to poetics) question: does any of you know
about possible connections between Gysin and the Surrealists? I had the
notion that somewhere Gysin said Breton had thrown him out of the
Surrealist movement, but I may be way off--would be interested in
confirmation / disconfirmation of that, further information, etc. The
context for this question is that I have a student who's trying to track
a web of connections from Tzara / Dada to Surrealism to Gysin to
Burroughs as he writes about *The Ticket That Exploded*, *Nova Express*
and *The Soft Machine*.

I am astonished to find Dr.Nielsen, usually the most sensible and

this a convenient solution to the problem, I must inquire of A.N. what are
the grounds of his finding a term adopted not only by many of our peers,

Britain's Poet Laureate Hughes Dies

Filed at 9:57 a.m. EST

By The Associated Press

LONDON (AP) -- British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy marriage to
the anguished American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his reputation after her
suicide, has died. He was 68.

Hughes died Wednesday at his home in Devon after an 18-month battle with
cancer, which he had kept secret, said Matthew Evans, chairman of Hughes'
publishing company, Faber and Faber.

``Not only was he one of the greatest poets of the 20th century, but he was
the most extraordinary man,'' Evans said today. ``The loss to his family is
inestimable.''

A collection of searingly intense poems published by Hughes this year called
``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on his difficult six-year marriage to
the tortured Plath, brought him sympathy and won him rave reviews.

The reclusive Hughes chose not to defend himself after Plath's suicide on
Feb. 11, 1963, months after he had left her for another woman. She gassed
herself in the kitchen, leaving milk and cookies for the couple's two
children in the next room.

Some Plath fans had called Hughes a murderer, and his name was repeatedly
hacked off her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern England.

Evans noted that there was ``a great deal of understanding'' after Hughes
put forth his story for the first time -- and revealed the obvious depth of
his love for Plath -- in the 88 poems that make up ``Birthday Letters,''
chronicling the couple's meeting, marriage and separation.

The poems surprised many with their startling intimacy they revealed. Of the
first time the couple made love, Hughes wrote:

``You were slim and lithe and smooth as a fish.

You were a new world. My new world.

So this is America, I marveled.

Beautiful, beautiful America.''

Hughes, poet laureate since 1984, refused to be interviewed about the poems,
which span 25 years beginning in the late 1960s.

But in a letter read by his editor, Christopher Reid, he called the book ``a
gathering of the occasions -- written with no plan over about 25 years -- in
which I tried to open a direct, private, inner contact with my first wife,
not thinking to make a poem, thinking mainly to evoke her presence to myself
and to feel her there listening.''

Hughes and Plath married in 1956 after meeting at Cambridge. They went to
the United States in 1957, where she taught at Smith College and he taught
at the University of Massachusetts. They returned to England in 1959 and
continued to write and publish poetry.

Plath had had a history of mental problems and had first attempted suicide
three years before meeting Hughes.

Poet Andrew Motion, writing in The Times of London, said reading ``Birthday
Letters'' was ``like being hit by a thunderbolt.''

``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof of his hard heart will
immediately see how stony they have been themselves,'' Motion wrote. ``It
closes in a heart of darkness, a black hole of grief and regret. We stare
into it feeling changed and enriched.''

The book was dedicated to the couple's children, Nicholas and Frieda.

At the time of its publication, Frieda, a 34-year-old artist, said in a
newspaper interview that she had lived under the burden of her mother's
suicide.

``I never read my parents' poetry until a couple of years ago,'' she said.
``I even rejected the chance to study my father's work for school exams. It
was too close to home.''

Hughes was the son of a carpenter, born Aug. 17, 1930, in the bleak mill
town of Mytholmroyd in Yorkshire, northern England.

He began writing poems in grammar school. After studying at Cambridge
University, he took a number of part-time jobs to support his writing.

His first volume of poems, ``Hawk in the Rain,'' was published in 1957 and
set the scene for his later work with its unsentimental and savage view of
the natural world.

Hughes, who remarried in 1970, published more than 35 poems and collections
of verse, three works of prose, two opera libretti and four stage plays. He
was a successful children's writer as well, publishing five poetic works for
young people and seven stories including the popular ``The Iron Man'' --
published in 1968 in the United States as ``The Iron Giant.''

In January, he won the Whitbread Book of the Year award for ``Tales of
Ovid,'' his reworking of Ovid's ``Metamorphosis,'' which the judges
described as a work of ``greatness and sublimity.''

Hughes' last appearance in public was 13 days ago, when he accepted the
Order of Merit, a rare honor, from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.

The queen was ``very saddened and will be in touch with his family. She was
grateful for the opportunity to recognize his work and achievements before
he died,'' a palace statement said.

Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement saying, ``He was a towering
figure in 20th century literature who even in his last years was producing
great works.''

I've heard the story of Gysin being thrown out by Breton on a few
occassions, but don't know much of the details beyond that.  A good book
which does gives some treatment to Gysin's art and his history is Robert
A. Sobieszek's _Ports of Entry: William S. Burroughs and the Arts_ (Los
Angeles: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1996.)  Sobieszek also covers
the cut-up novels, and he provides a large number of plates of a variety
of other cut-up experiments done in that period as well.

Nobody calls me "perspicacious" and gets away with it! (Though I was once
asked to be "perspicuous.")

"s/he" is as impossible to pronounce [is the "/" silent here, as in "either
/ or"] as it is to affect -- effect?  and why is it "s/he" and not "h/se"?

I know some people alternate gender from one paragraph to another, but I
have always found that profoundly unsatisfying --

sincerly,

I seem to remember that Gysin was tossed from the surrealists, in BG's
words, for insubordination and a refusal to get with the program. I read
a book not long ago called _Writing at Risk_ edited by Jason Weiss,
which contains a couple of interviews w/ Gysin and if memory serves, Gysin
addresses that question. I wonder if Gysin might make a cameo in that
Breton biography that came out 1-2 years back. Finally, the good ol' DLB
might be a good place for your student to start looking, too.

"And I remember somebody leaning up against the dirt wall of the
hillside, deriding William Carlos Williams, when suddenly there was a loud
roaring, crunching noise and a chunk of the hill fell off and covered the
person up to his neck. The person, being a young classical poet fresh from
NYU, begun screaming that he was being buried alive.  Fortunately, the
landslide stopped and we dug him out and dusted him off. That was the last
time he said anything against William Carlos Williams. The next day he
began reading _Journey to Love_ rather feverishly."

no, there is simply an inflation assumption built in, though the
conventional wisdom now is deflation, not inflation.  but inflation
could always return, according to Chairman Greenspan.

Dear List:

It seems I must clarify, for since posting my 5 Moe thing people
have been writing me to say that they don't really hate me, that
everything will be all right. Even David Bromige, my favorite
ironist, whom I used to believe could read the tongue in cheek
in brail even, posts to the world to say he doesn't really hate me.
(Of course, it does occur to me that he is perhaps being ironic, but
I shall take him at his word.) So I thank you all, but holy cow! Now
I feel somehow like Huck Finn at his own funeral, though I don't know
if that is the best analogy. Probably it isn't.

Anyway, I would like to say, for the record, that even though my
reputation among some listees is not top of the charts, I have quite
a few b-c friends and am not lonely at all. A practicing Buddhist, I
even have good feelings for those who think I'm a racist and all
that, and daily I ask Jesus to take away my anger toward them.

So don't worry about me. I'm fine, really.

Kent

I meant DB could read "the tongue in cheek in _braille_." I just
looked at my dictionary and see that a "brail" is a fishnet of
sorts. There is a joke here somewhere, probably, involving stockings.

Thursday (written by Jennifer, 11th grade!*)


Dust lay by the side of the road. Dust gathered in the air, held in abey-
ance by the thickness of electromagnetic radiations. There were bipolar
vortices, hysterias of agglutinated particles. The heat bore down, dried
out the last remnants of liquid coursing through the sheen of long-depar-
ted ghosts. Throats were parched for lack of oxygen. Everyone in the gay
party had mummified into exact replicas of living statues, then toppled
by the unforgiving wind! It was a horrifying spectacle, were that any
would have been around to perceive it, but the dry air promised that not
a single living soul would ever have been in sight. There would have
been beautiful refractions of light and dark in the midst of the gather-
ing swirls. The surface of the dreary planet was corrupted, too, and all
vestiges of life were removed forever. No one would ever know what beau-
tiful people had lived and played here, the tiny laughter of chattering
children watched by beloved parents. Lovely sliding-boards and swings
would have been very rusted, then just disappeared.

Hyenas and beasts howled in the wilderness, themselves deafened by all
the battles that had gone on before. Everything just went on like that,
but it was all in vein!** Accumulations of refugees had been stopped in
their very tracks.** Even their bones were pulverized. It was as if
there were an angry god alone in her world forever, because there was
no one left to worship Her. And no one would know it was Thursday.

*I must have been thinking about cyberspace!
**Drugs?

Dear Maria
At last I am up to writing. I'm so overwhelmed with the crisis here - and not
 only the crisis but the way things have been going here since an attempt has
 been made in the 90s to dismantle the Soviet regime. Now it's clear that
 they should have kept as much as possible from the past structure because now
 nobody is competent and noble enough to build something decent.
Now the festival...
Oct 17,18 and 19 in St Petersburg. Moika 12 Pushkin's apartment. The hall
in the former
stables is packed full - about 200 paople have come which is a marvel: the
crisis in
 Russia is in full swing. The first two nights poets read - twelve poets
every night.
The last night - round table and reception. Among Moscow guests - prominent
literary figures Lev Rubinstein who read his famous piece "This is me" filing
 through catalogue cards that he was holding in his hand (he worked as a
 librarian for many years) - the whole poem is a list of photographs of his
 family, friends and relatives with short comments, an attempt to catch the
time long
 past and very amusing too. The way he reads holds the audience in suspense.
 Dmitry Prigov, a master of "sotsart" (socialist art) drawing heavily on soviet
idiom. This time he gave a brilliant perfomance singing the first verse of
Pushkin's "Evgeni Onegin" as a buddhist monk, Russian Orthodox priest and
 muslim muezzin. Someone said later:"How could he dare mock Pushkin, the sun of
 Russian poetry?" That's exactly what Prigov meant - to destroy the ideological
structure built in the Soviet times on Pushkin.
Bonifatsii (German Lukomnikov) - a charming person and performance artist
read some of his short and extremely witty (for us who live here) poems.
One of them: "Why don't I fly?" (several times with different modulations of
 voice but very romantically) And suddenly in a matter-of-fact and slightly
offended tone "Why don't I fly? I fly."
Dmitry Avaliani showed his inscriptions on large pieces of paper, cardboard, on
bowls and other unlikely stuff that could be read upside down too making the
 two words reveal the inner meanings of each other. He is a superb master of
anagrams and palindromes.
Dmitry Vodennikov, one of the younger participants, with his outwardly
 unpretentious poems that manage somehow to convey the capricious mood of his
generation, their seeking for the final truths and deconstruction of
falsehoods.
Viktor Krivulin of St.Petersburg, a basic figure in Russian undergroung
literature of Brezhnev's
 time, opened the first night of readings.
Among St.Petersburg poets - wonderful Vladimir Kucheriavkin and Nikolai
 Kononov, very deep Sergei Stratanovsky, Mikhail Eremin - all first-class
 poets of present-day.
What was amazing in St.Petersburg was the atmosphere and the response of the
public. It was so warm and energetic, so energetic that there were fistfights.
Every twenty minutes there was a commotion in the audience, the people were
expressing  their various emotions ranging from disgust to appreciation by,
for example, standing up and reading their own poetry in
a loud voice and there was no stopping them. Dmitry Kuzmin, a leading figure
 in Moscow literary life, a poet and critic, a curator of the poetic salon
"Avtornik"  (meeting every Tuesday), even had to break the readings and
appeal to the public trying to shame them into a better behavior. But his
appeals
were wasted. During Kononov's reading a man stood up (by the way he was a
 friend  of Sergei Zavialov, organizer of the festival) and said,
addressing the audience, that the poet in question was a bloody bustard and his
 poetry is a piece of disgusting bullshit (Kononov was reading a poem about
man-eaters, kannibals and used some obscene language}, this confrontation
of two
 aesthetic positions came to a climax in the interval when Kononov had a
fight with
 his admirer. Moscow guests had a great time watching all this because (as we,
St.Petersburgians found later , during the Moscow part of the festival)
the sophisticated Moscow, tired of life and not to be surprised with stuff,
haven't seen anything like this since the time of (maybe) Mayakovsky who
loved scandal. They were happy to discover that there are still people in
Russia
 who could kill for poetry. In Moscow the festival public was very
respectable -
only literary people came: poets, critics, curators of poetic salons; their
girl-friends (a few) were the only independent observers.
A propos girl-friends. What was notoriously missing at the festival were women
authors and critics: nearly forty participants for three women (four including
me as wife and helper for the organizer and a translator of a visiting poet
 from Germany Schuldt).
 On the last day of the festival at the discussion a visiting poet from Boston
 Jim Kates (who also gave a reading alongside with
the German poet Schuldt) tried to raise the question of women-participants but
no-one even cared to answer it properly. The only thing we seemed to be
good for
was washing the marble floors of the salon where the final reception was held
(this action was performed by the author of these lines - I meant it to be a
performance but nobody noticed).
Now I would like to strike a serious key. The festival was intended to research
into the phenomenon of Moscow and St.Petersburg poetry, two rival cities of
Russian culture. Is it really that, as the Moscow poet Mikhail Aizenberg put
it, there is good poetry, bad poetry and St.Petersburg poetry?
The results of the research prove that St.Petersburg poetry numbers some
first-class poets but, to my mind, they are those who border on Moscow styles,
who like experimenting and who are ready to give up beautiful lines for
freshness,
throb of time and enjoyment their poetry could give to the public.
Dostoevski called St.Petersburg "the most abstract and artificial city on
earth".
The same can be said about some of the poetry here.
Some of the St. P. poets write the way as if nothing happened for the last
eighty
 years, as if they can start right where the pre-revolutionary Silver-Age poets
left off. Moscow people realize that they have to work through the Soviet
period and incorporate it somehow into their writing.They act as
psychoanalytics
for the national sub-conscious working through fobias and anxieties accumulated
during the desolate years of Stalinism and Brezhnevism.
Strange as it may seem for you but this festival demonstrated that what poets
write is not their personal affair. It's not true that there are good poets and
there are bad poets as was said at the festival (and thousands of times before
but here in the sense that there is no Moscow and St.Petersburg poetry there is
 good etc.) There is Moscow poetry (I think) that takes the time into account
and becomes timeless and St.P. poetry that is timeless and dies the moment it
is published (not all of it of course)
Poets have to feel their way into the complexities of the time they are living
in.And sometimes it's only much later that it becomes evident who was in
contact with the spirit of the time and who was not. It doesn't matter waht
they
write about, they always write about modernity.

Oh, dear, that's enough for today. I'm afraid it's too long already.
If you have any questions please you are very welcome. Maybe I should add
something
or focus on some other things of more interest for you.
So this report is subject to change. You could make it shorter. Or I could
write another shorter one using some of the above.

Thanks very much for the info--but who the hell wants to pay $100? Can't
I just sneak in after the movie starts? And what do they do with your
$100 anyway?
Thanks for posting.

I just received some goodies in the mail, and would like to recommend Daniel
Zimmerman's own sonnets composed using the site he mentions in this posting.
Construced with Spicer's observation in mind that "the perfect poem has an
infinitely small vocabulary," they create intricate little worlds.  I'm a
great fan of Oulipo and Raymond Roussel, and use anagrams, palindromes and
other structuring devices in my texts, so I applaud such texts as these, and
offer one of Dan's sonnets for your consideration:

fall Eve, prior text,
ravel text of peril:
rival of expert, let
text of April revel,
let leaf vortex rip,
prove text all fire,
love frail pretext,
evil report falter.
I fall over pretext,
flip over real text,
lilt of expert rave.
I felt a vortex pearl
fall over ripe text,
all text forever pi

Notice the humor--a rare device these days among experimentalists.  I also
received blue horitals (Oasii, 1997), a collaboration between the late John
Clarke, and Dan Zimmerman.  I recommend this work for the dept of its
engagement with myth.  The most obvious, and touching level, is Zimmerman
exploring his former teacher's text, and giving his own living answer to a
work of literature that is finally, irrevocably finished.  I'm still
digesting blue horitals' many levels, but wanted to mention it quickly
before signing off.  Jesse Glass

One of the most extrordinary poetry readings I ever experienced was by Ted Hughes many years ago in
Victoria BC at Open Space. He was transfixing. His voice and the depth of his work resonates with me
still.

About five years earlier, I encountered some of his work for the first time in an English class when
I read "Thought Fox." The leap of Hughes's wild fox into the mind remains with me even more strongly
than his amazing reading.

Hi Alan

A book that might help here is "Here to Go: Planet R-101" Brion Gysin
interviewed by Terry Wilson (Quartet Books, London 1982) - I think it's
pretty obscure, I picked it up in a secondhand store a couple of years
back.  It's a series of interviews with Gysin. A quick scan thru the index
brings up a few references to Breton & Surrealism - Gysin claims he showed
his art with the Surrealists in 1935, or in fact hung his drawings for a
Surrealist exhibition but they were taken down before the show opened "on
the orders of Breton".  Gysin refered to the Surrealists as the Art Wing of
the Freudian Conspiracy ...

What a GREAT GREAT GREAT report from the floorwasher Zavialova.
I will NEVER delete it.
It's 10am on the penultimate day of October and all these RUSSIANS
(presumably) have just tumbled into my office, not just the
muezzin-blasting,bowl-bashing, floor-washing poets but the fistfighting
bellowing poets too.  Why couldn't *I* have been there?  Ain't I a woman?
Hey, if I can't actually ATTEND events like this, the next best thing
(possibly even a better thing) is to HEAR about them.  THANK YOU THANK YOU
Masha and I hope you did a good job with that floor.
Your suds resonate in Ithaca today!

1. CHROMATIC DEFACEMENT, by Phillip Foss
96 pages, ISBN 0-925904-22-8
cover painting:  BRAINSTORM, by Mark Spencer

"Phillip Foss's *Chromatic Defacement* is a new *fin de siecle* theater of
cruelty with the roles played by perfumes, echoes and elisions. "Coquettish
effluvia." Susan Howe meets Bataille and they have t his child called
'Fetter of Nuance' or, in fact, *Chromatic Defacement.* I think I'm in love
with it."
                        -- Rae Armantrout

"One of the problems with desire is duration. It's over before you know it
and, once you know it, it's over. Hence the value of this book, which
destroys desire but which does so, dextrously and indefatigably --
operatically, in and by steps. *Such light steps, such destruction.*
Innumerable steps, not only half-steps in innumerable directions at
innumerable speeds. Operatic and balletic. Following the steps of Phillip
Foss, one of Lully's latter-day and more intrepid progeny surely, you will
re-make desire. Re-make it and re-make it. Rmake it and make it last. At
last."
                        -- John Taggart

from CAPRICCI 25  (in CHROMATIC DEFACEMENT)

Easy release is seldom available, given the disclosures
of erosion; given the way things levitate and exceed optics

Once I killed myself observing stone; such weight was in my
head I surrendered to song, though I have no voice

The sight of the world must be reconciled to an equation
of sound (or wound); sound to emotion; emotion to genitals

Does a soprano crescendo equal orgasm

No, it is a weapon; a hollow spine, embodied,
though the reverse cannot be true

since sound comes off the gut as light through a prism
and penetrates the heads of the assembled -- or so they believe --

but if I play: there is no world, they believe I am absent;
if I play: there is *a* world, they believe I am

Thus I acknowledge just debt:


2. & CALLING IT HOME, by Lisa Cooper
104 pp., ISBN 0-925904-17-1
cover painting: 1/2MOON HOUSE, by Cynthia Miller

"Into the adroitly crafted domain of *& Calling It  Home,* Lisa Cooper
boldly summons 'Our Lady,' Gertrude Stein, and Jack Spicer's *A Book of
Music, Book of Magazine Verse,* and *After Lorca.* 'There's no escape from
constancy or change,' Cooper observed in an earlier book, *The Ballad in
Memory,* and here she investigates the binding power of literary tradition
and the poem's legacy of music while playing Spicer's songs 'like a
jukebox' in homolinguistic translation. Keeping the music and changing the
purport, she has it both ways as she transposes Spicer's quotation of Poe's
'Indefiniteness is an element of the true music' into the decisive, 'In
deafening intelligence on a ruse moving.' In reponse to her artful ruses
and rousing intelligence, the powers of language, poetry and music come
when she calls.
                        -- Mary Margaret Sloan

"Lisa Cooper asks big questions. Like what is sense? Or why do men and
women do what they do? Is it nature or culture? And she asks them of
today's saints of everything that matters: Jack Spicer and Gertrude Stein.
She gets no answers from either. But she writes a lot of great poems in the
asking."
                        -- Juliana Spahr

Matter gets us dirty but stands
For alms & bleeds confounded plastic
Of substance. Blue toys
With banners, dashing hooves, we fall or splay
On a wet ridge.
Born in the light of something bent --
But not taken from us -- like a day
Does helpless commotion.
Sea call, some sport
Or play of the ridge, we hope
Like a helpless bluebell
On the ridge.

And what's on the inside & what's on the outside for Jack. He got out of

The church says not to fall for these folk figures, there's too much credit
given the saints & they make the people superstitious. And that includes
St. Jack.

They asked if my sin was loving him more than God. I said love is the *way*

. . . many are the students who have gone to MLA sessions and book
exhibits on a paying friend's badge, which that friend "lost" and "paid"
$10 to "replace."

Just an observation.

Subject:      joking aside, s/he thing

the very arguments against gender-equal pronoun use and their
vehemence are, for me, disproportionately impassioned and suggest
deeper and unacknowledged agendas.

first, the notion of "he" and "man" as universal.  it isn't.  period.
over half of the human race (remember, women, due to greater fetal
deformation and miscarriage of males, are born in naturally higher
proportions) is not included in that pronoun.  EXAMPLE: three
professors from wales are at the chaucerian section of MLA conf.  two
are men, one is a woman sitting at opposite end of room.  speaker says
"when one of our distinguished colleages from wales researched the
inks of the Ellesmere ms., he discovered that..." -- i GUARANTEE that
no one in the room will turn to look at the welsh woman as a possible
quote source.  so much for "he" as universal.

second, move the context.  consider so-called "universal" voting
requirement "white male landowner."  look what changed in that first
-- landowner went.  why? -- not everyone owns land.  non-landowners
wanted representation and had, finally, numbers/influence enough to
get it.  next, "white."  again, world (in which "white" is,
statistically, a minority) finally admitted that "white" was not a
universal.  now, what is left?  "male."  and we STILL try and argue
about it?  no one would claim that an advertisement talking about
"white" and "christian" and "caucasion" as "universal" for job
applicant was fair.  why would anyone argue "he" and "man" -- pronouns
explicitly for men -- are?

third, what, specifically, is being asked re pronoun shift?  re
earlier example, in consideration of economic prejudice and racism, it
has been asked, and pretty much universally granted, that texts
talking about non-landowning and non-white groups/races as "savage"
and "uncivilized" and, in general, pejoratively, ought be changed if
possible, and if as authored texts necessary to teach unbowdlerized,
that acknowledgement of problematic be made.  not such a big deal.
"unwashed peasants," "savages," "nigger," etc. simply removed from reasoned
discourse.  why, then, this great fuss over making women equal part of
discourse by reconsidering and reusing pronouns?

look, i am a woman.  when i am in a group that talks about "well we
were looking for men who have completed X requirement for this job"
and "well, men, sit here" and "what man has written" i do not feel
included.  in fact, i specifically feel specifically disincluded.  and
i am not a lone crank -- when i've said something, if, indeed, i was
not beaten to the punch by someone else, most if not all the women
indicate agreement.  period.  the message here: many women DO NOT FEEL
INCLUDED BY THE USE OF "MAN," "MEN," and "MALE" AS A SO-CALLED
UNIVERSAL.  this isn't speculative, it isn't a matter of "well a few
crazy bra burning [insert further favorite mocking pejoratives --
remember "sambo" and those "unwashed poor"?...] feminists INSIST..."
it is a matter of large numbers of reasonable human beings feeling
explicitly cut off from discourse about human race by terms for same
that explicitly do not include them.  how much clearer can this be?

solution: a number of ingenious easy ones.  s/he is a neat one.  if
reading aloud, obviously, one says "she or he" or "he or she."  use of
"one," or "they."  and, obviously, "human" and "people" rather than
"men" and "man."  or, as one person i know suggested and as i rather
enjoy, use of "she" and "her" as universal, with a few "he's"
intermingled.  i.e. "The writer might consider her pen to be mightier
than a sword, but does history really support this?  Consider the
author of a document calling for an end to book banning as his
document is banned."

when it comes down to it, if there is a painless way to begin to
reverse centuries of oppression, persecution, and discrimination, and
make over half of the human race feel more comfortable and included,
and all it takes is slightly more attentive pronoun use, why on earth
would anyone argue against it?

Masha Zaviola's post was fantastic. Why can't there be poetry
festivals like that here, though with women reading and fighting
instead of wiping, of course.

I can't resist making what might appear to be jsut a self-promotion
plug, but I suspect others were fascinatied by Zaviola's post and
would liek to know more about new Russian poetry. A very good place
to begin is with a book I edited called _Third Wave: The New Russian
Poetry_ (Michigan, 1992), wherein a number of the folks Zaviola
mentions appear. The book has a long introduction by Alexei
Parschikov and Andrew Wachtel, great poems and poetics statements by
the contributors, and an afterword essay by Mikhail Epstein-- one of
Russia's (tho he's currently at Emory U.) most important literary
critics and cultural theorists-- which maps the major tendencies and
movements of late and post-Soviet poetry.

The book's still in print and really is the most complete gathering
in English of current "avant-garde" Russian poets. Some of the very
best translators in the field are also here: Hejinian, Janecek,
Schmidt, Wesling, Molnar, Wachtel, numerous others.

Hi Mairead --

You're right, there does seem to be a lot of commerce on this listserv --
and it's true, it wasn't always so -- maybe four or five years ago --

but the list-originator hisself has said one of the main things he prizes
about this list is the announcements of publications and events that
otherwise would get no announcement at all --

I myself like that kind of sports -- and show it by hucking things here
often -- even tho I can barely afford to produce the the things I sell --
and try to charge nothing for the events that I host --

signed, your comrade against these intrusions of exchange value

The Russian poetry festival message WAS g-r-r-eat, yeah.  But she clearly
has a Moscow bias.  The most "avant-garde" poet she mentioned, Lev

Subject:      Re: KENT JOHNSON

in fact, on my last excursion to the midwest, i met kent johnson.  when i
arrived at the airport, i had telegraphed ahead suggesting a meeting.  little
did i wot what would ensue...

there was no sign of mr. johnson at the gate.  there was, however, a
really humongous rubber potted plant next to the area where he had
told me to wait.  if its extravagant size were not enough to make the
"plant" conspicuous, the large red keds sticking out the bottom
certainly were.

finally, i went to claim my luggage.  several rotations later, i
turned around and... the plant was next to me, along with a crowd of
fascinated travellors who, evidently, had followed it.  suddenly, a
fat, juicy "pssttt" rang out from behind the extravagant rubber
foliage across the dusty carpets and accoustic-tiled ceiling.  i
walked over to the "plant," and its keds popped inside the brown clay
base.  i went back to my luggage... "psst!"  walked back, POP!  this
went on for a while.  soon the entire luggage area was overflowing
with fascinated spectators, one of whom began announcing the
plant/psst/ked volley play by play like a tennis match.

as i got my last peice of carry on (a faux-pearl encrusted d____ given
to me by bowering, that heartless cad, shortly before he took off with
my credit card, silk undies, and, basically, anything not nailed down)
a small wadded up paper slammed into my rump.  i read it: "don't look
now, but go to the airport lobby and i'll meet you there.  kent."

i went to the lobby.  the "plant" followed, along with much of the
fascinated audience from the luggage pick-up.  i had had enough.  i
walked up to the "plant" and trod on one of the keds beforeit could
slip inside the pot again.  "mr. johnson, when you promised me a
reception worthy of a wildly avant-garde writer and scholar coupled
with all the erudition and footnotes a world-class university can
offer, i am confident this embarrassing fal-te-rol was not in the
contract.  i've about had enough!"

"please, my plush occidental fringe, my delicatly painted kirman, only
be patient and i will sweep you away to the greatest in decadence,
luxury, joy, that the endnotes of the Ellesmere codex can
offer... only be patient...  you see, i have ENEMIES!"

"nonsense!"

"no, they are everywhere!  they are after me for my gender inclusive
pronouns, my interesting off-color anecdotes about spicer..."

i shouted "don't be ridiculous.  no one wants gender-inclusive
pronouns, they are yesterdays news!  and ALL anecdotes about spicer
are off-color since sondhiem interrogated the notion of on-color in
his last jennifer monologue!  i'm out of here!"  then took the next
plane back.  i did, however, introduce him to bowering and bromige (in
order to keep him from following me onto the plane), who were, to no
one's great surprise, lizarding around the airport lounge.  weeks
later, johnson sent me a pathetic begging letter asking me to help
foot the large bar tab bowering and bromige stuck him with, enclosing
a copy of the tab, as well as several damp cigar butts, a soiled
undergarment, and one green rubber electronic massage device purported
to have come from the raincoat pocket of bowering himself as proof.  i
promptly threw the lot into the trash and disinfected my hall table.

and let that be a lesson to all of you.

Evguenie Sokolov  by Serge Gainsbourg (1928-1991)
ISBN  0-9662346-1-8     Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 97-80957
Translated from the  French by John and Doreen Weightman

        This is the one and only novel by the 20th century provocateur of
=46rench pop music and film  - the legendary Serge Gainsbourg .   This
prototype lusty punk tore into the threads of French society with his
numerous films, music projects, and outlandish persona.   He made
recordings with Brigitte Bardot, Jane Birkin  and a scandalous recording of
=84Lemon Incest=BE with his own daughter Charlotte.   If that wasn=BCt bad
enough, he told Whitney Houston  live on French TV that he would love to
fuck her.

        Evguenie Sokolov  is a novel about an artist who uses his
intestinal gases as the medium for his scandalous artwork.  What once was a
huge smelly and noisy problem in his social and sex life becomes a tool for
success in the early eighties art world.   Please note that there is also a
song by Gainsbourg called "Evguenie Sokolov"  of farting noises over a
reggae track.

Some quotes about Gainsbourg and the novel:



"Gainsbourg is both the best and the worst, yin and yang, white and black.
This Jewish little Prince from Russia whose dreams were probably fueled by
Andersen, Perrault and Grimm, became, when confronted by the tragic reality
of life, a moving or repugnant Quasimodo, depending on his and your state
of mind.  Hidden deep within this fragile, shy and aggressive man lies the
soul of a poet craving tenderness, truth and integrity."   Brigitte Bardot

"Serge Gainsbourg is one of the world's great eccentrics.  His kinky
obsessions, smothering fashion with tastelessness have catapulted him into
super stardom in France.

This is his only novel and you have never read anything like it  Evgueine
Sokolov will make you squirm.  It will make you laugh.  It also may very
well make you sick.  Gainsbourg's vision is his own: authentic and
convulsive.  But don't forget to hold your nose."   John Zorn

"Gainsbourg takes one childish, cheap and tasteless one-joke idea and
manages to keep it entertaining enough to last for a whole book. he has an
envious command of adjectives and adverbs." Mark Webber, Pulp


Thanks,

This is a very silly and selfish complaint. Were it not for such
annoucements of magazine and book publications as occur on this List, I for
one would be completely ignorant of their existence.

Part of the business of poetry is the commerce of poetry. Love it or leave
it. As for those who find fault with that may they croak in the swamp
undisturbed.

1). Pritchett, surely you meant to tippy "the business of publishing and
book-selling," not "the business of poetry."  If you did mean to tippy
"the business of poetry is the commerce of poetry," I'd say you already
left, man.  You already left.

2). Good riddance.

3). I think Mairead's point is simply this: if you Must advertise here,
do it with pizzazz. Do it, in other words, with poetry, Pritchett.

I just have to say that I have never met Eliza McGrand, though now I
want to and very much.

I also want to ask her how she knew that I am currently wearing a
pair of Keds? Is this a trick of the AI lab she works for at MIT?

Thrilling to read Eliza cutting loose on a List meant only for the most
earnest discussion of form as content and v.v.! It moves me to my
twobitsworth : what Bowering and I found out in that airport lounge bar is
that "Kent Johnson" is a false impression which is the work of a Japanese
writer, name of Yasusada. Hence the pathetic attempt at disguise when Eliza
traveled to Highland College. This Mr. Yasusada worked out an elaborate
double-hoax whereby "Kent Johnson" was represented--through implication and
innuendo--as misrepresenting himself as one "Yasusada."

That a man (or a woman, for that matter) should go to such lengths, and
then spill the beans to a couple of layabouts in cheap suits in a
provincial airport, is attributable to the amazing range of mixed drinks
Bowering was able to order up. He told us (GB, not Mr Y) that he had gone
to bartending school with John Ashbery. But I think I was the only one who
told the truth on that occasion. Occasionally. How to know otherwise?

I liked Mr Yasusada, engaging and bright, and diligent in his creation of a
man (not a woman)  who in addition to being a college teacher and fine
poet, had also worked for revolutionary groups in the jungles of Central
America, toured Russia with some notorious Language Poets, and under the
name of Brendan O'Brien, worked for Irish unity in the emerald isle. After
the fifth libation, removing the little umbrella from from teeth,, I told
him, "Even if you _were_ Kent Johnson, I would love you ole buddy." I hadnt
an ironic bone left in my body. I had poured all my irony into reading
_Braille_ by Bob Perelman, who wouldnt take his tongue out of my cheek. And
then Daddy came home, darling, and tucked you in and told you a bedtime
story. The End.

books for sale, then I'm more than happy to comply. But between making
books, writing poems, etc. -- I don't think I'm going to spend my time
devising "interesting, enthralling, exhilarating, salivating" ways of
selling them -- I'd much rather spend that time setting type or inking up
the vandercook to print something -- and so far I haven't quite figured out
how to make the computer screen actually feel, smell, and sound like paper
with a printer's impression on it. I like what people I've asked to write
blurbs for books have said about those books, and I'm glad to put them out
there -- but also glad not to, if that's what the list wants.

The principle reason I lurk on this list is to find out what people are
printing sos I'll know what to read.  And as I leave my office hours, I'll
be stopping by the library to find some Kensward Elmslie.  I may even
order out a journal or two.

1)  where the $100.00 goes -- well . . . putting on a conference for around
ten-thousand people spread through three hotels and hiring shuttles for
same probably takes up a fair hunk of change -- I doubt that the MLA is
using this as a fundraiser -- used to only cost $5.00 to "lose" a badge --
Several of us can remember the somewhat unsettling experience of talking to
two people (often of differeng genders) with identical identification on
their ID badges --
AND remember that the best movies are free -- there are several readings
and sessions open to the unregistered public --

(was anybody else in the audience for that session in New York some years
back where thay had to put guards around the room because of death threats
to Edward Said?  I always remember that episode when I meet people who are
dismissive about the little bit of "academic freedom" that has ever been
available to us)

2)  Kent:  to quote a favorite song of many years ago, "I don't hate
anybody very much!"

3)  PLEASE, everybody, keep those notices of publications and readings
coming -- As Patrick and others have said, this list is often the ONLY way
most of us would hear of such things -- It is also the closest to actual
poetics we come in our exchanges on some days --

Here's an idea, inspired by McGrand and Bromige's airport encounter with
that hateful Kent Johnson, aka Yasasudi, Belzebubbles, Coyote Boy... Why
don't we have an on-line Halloween Masquerade, where all messages to the
List are disguised by voice, tone and character? Let's be as
transgressive as we'd like, and sublimate our most repressed impulses
through these Halloween Posts. I thought, in honor of Pound's birthday,
today, and Keats', tomorow, some transformative and animated cyber
spirit-plunging would be a welcome relief to the usual measured pulse
that guides this provacotive social domain. Come fellow poets, let's
indulge in a bit of online Saturnalia! So fashion your masks and come ye
a-revelling. Oh, and leave a few crumbs for the Dead.

             Yours,

who was it sent that message pretending to be Dale Smith????  I've got to
admit it was an almost convincing disguise,,,, but if you compare the
writing of that message carefully to the Dale Smith who appears in the Mike
& Dale's interview with Charles Bernstein, the differences will become
apparent -- unless, of course, THAT was a fictive Dale!

On second thought, maybe we shouldn't.  Masquerading as others might cause more
trouble than it's worth.  Some people can be quite transgressive, and I'm not
sure how people here on this list would take it.  Erase from ye memories devoted
poets the memory of my former request.

      Yours,

Well, if you're in or are gonna be in NYC on this date. I got this sent to
me today & thought I'd pass it along. It's at Columbia. Ciao for niao --G

Tariq Ali will be in the Graduate Student Lounge (301 Philosophy Hall) on
Thursday, November 5 at 6:00 pm to discuss and sign copies of his new book,
"The Book of Saladin."  This evening is sponsored by Verso and Labryinth
Books.  A short blurb about the book follows.
---------------------------------
'The Book of Saladin is the second in a trilogy of novels by Tariq Ali on
the
long encounter between Western Christendom and the world of Islam.
Grippingly
well told, brilliantly paced, remarkably convincing in its historical
depiction of a fateful relationship, it is a narrative for our time, haunted
by distant events and characters who are closer to us than we dreamed.'
---Edward W. Said

Tariq Ali's latest novel is a rich and teeming chronicle set in twelfth-
century Cairo, Damascus and Jerusalem.  The Book of Saladin is the fictional
memoir of Saladin, the Kurdish liberator of Jerusalem, as dictated to a
Jewish
scribe, Ibn Yakub.

The novel charts the rise of Saladin as Sultan of Egypt and Syria and
follows
him as he prepares, in alliance with his Jewish and Christian subjects, to
take Jerusalem back from the Crusaders.  It is a medieval story, but much of
it will be cannily familiar to those who follow events in contemporary
Cairo,
Damascus and Baghdad.  Betrayed hopes, disillusioned soldiers and unreliable
alliances form the backdrop to The Book of Saladin.

Hi Charles,
Spend your time on the books. I was dismayed with Mairead's protest, 'cause I
had just finished reading your post, and was particularly pleased that you had
offered some of Phillip Foss's & Lisa Cooper's work along with the blurbs.

It's 2541


30/10/41, 30/10/2541, 10/30/98, 10/30/1998, time and again I will return
you know I will return
I will never be away
there will be no moment when I will be away
these times from unknown counts
there are always such, always such moment when I will be true to you
I will return and return, that is how I will be true
this isn't "psychological" but this is "net theory"

"net theory" accepts many dates for the deconstruction of our very own.
it is our very own that is in sad remiss.
you know that is true, and that is "net theory."
if this is "net art."
I am desperate that this be "net art." I am desperate that this
"net art" is also "net theory" of a high order which has an effect
on the way everyone thinks about "the net."

30/10/41, 30/10/2541, 10/30/98, 10/30/1998, are the dates I have
started to work on this "net art" of a high order, which will be
available on "the net." this is the first part of the "net theory,"
this "availability," which is very widespread into unknown parts,
just as 30/10/41 is also very much spread from unknown parts, into
other unknown parts.

there are many times and Jennifer lives in all of them,
and Jennifer has, as she has said many times before,
all the time in the world, because Jennifer has whatever times
and number you want and think, well I am here for a very short time,
and this is the time I want for Jennifer,
Fri Oct 30 04:21:23 EST 1998

this is how she works, as you take her up when I die in the real world,
the final wound not healing, final hard drive crash, sliver of light
against one or another angry sky or mob, she will pass on presence in the
system, disseminated everywhere in "net culture," "net art" and "net
theory," struggling in 2541 to awaken, begin again, you will always
remember Jennifer, or if not, Jennifer will be there, for your terrific
memory gift. I will go into the fields of the lord, I have my date with
Jennifer, Jennifer is my date

Bill Luoma announced he was reading with Fred Wah Sunday October 31 at
Bridge Street Books in DC -- is that Sunday Nov 1 or Saturday October 31

Listees:

I am looking for information that would help us in getting a Poets in
the Schools program going here in NW Illinois. I've done a general
search on the web and pulled up a few brief descriptions
about programs in California and Minnesota, and I've also tried a
phrase search on the Poets and Writer's site four times now, but
I wait and wait and wait and nothing happens.

I know Koch's stuff and Padgett's. What we need at this point is
a good "how-to" guide that deals with logistics of funding,
administration, scheduling, etc. Is there such a thing? Some kind of
handbook? Seems like there must be.

Any pointers would be much appreciated. There is a strong basis for
starting a program here: I've been organizing a "Young Poets Contest"
for area schools for the past three years, and we have received an
average of 800 or so individual submissions each time-- quite
amazing given the total enrollment.

Thanks,
Kent

Aldon,
You're clever enough that I'm sure you could find SOME way to sneak me
in--though I do think the "unregistered public" is a great title for
something.
Of course hearing what a fuckfest the MLA is, perhaps I could make other
arrangements--I'm KIDDING, only KIDDING, did I mention I'm KIDDING.
(Kent, I'm vying for post of most reviled listee.)
By the by, made a big post office run today--during work hours of
course--and Lipstick Eleven copies are on the way to all those who have
ordered them.
Thanks muchly,
Kathy Lou

Yo David. Thanks ever so for your suggestion. You're the clever sort a
girl just might want to bump into at the MLA in between panels. And
might I add that I'd like to ask everyone to continue to try and sell me
every possible thing they've ever wanted to sell on the Poetics
List.Buy! Sell! Buy! etc. Love those titles hot off the press if you
know what I'm saying. . .

I'm not getting the impression that Mairead's is the sentiment of the list
by a long shot. Even if i can't afford them i want to know what's being
published and if i can get a little sample of the work that's even better,
it's literary history and in a funny way encouragement for other
editor/publishers.
Seems like an opportune moment to mention that i've got a few copies left
of wit out, an edition of 55, wit out was prepared for the bp nichol
conference in vancouver, it's a preview of a larger omage in which 55
writers are writing 55 lines without an h, for bp nichol's 55th birthday.
wit out is one fifth, 11 poets, Karl Jirgens, Renee Rodin, David Bromige,
Fred Wah, Victoria Walker, Gerry Gilbert, Maxine Gadd, Kevin Killian, Jamie
Reid, Judith Copithorne and Susan Clarke. $5US includes postage. $5.50

Hello,  I do not really want to subscribe to the list right now (only
because my mailbox, used by other people, cannot yet handle so many
posts per day), but I am a poet who frequently checks your archives to
browse and enjoy (frustrated of course now & then by not being able to
post back!).  I read a post that said that French poet Pierre Martory
had died a few weeks ago, but I have been unable to find ANYTHING about
that passing anywhere, and wondered if there might be someone who could
direct me to a news source or other information.

Many thanks!

Oh yeah? Note that McGrand goes to great lengths to describe Kent's outfit,
but does not tell us anything about her own raiment. I mean, who comes to
the Midwest in a microskirt and hockey socks? Worse--they were New York
Islanders socks. They had dried something on them. She was wearing those
glasses with fake eyes painted on them. I could not help myself---havent

Dear Dead Huckster Society,

This is a backchannelfest to any Publisher or Editor whom might take an
anterest.  My name is Jim Keats.  Yes, I realise (ize?) my name sounds
a lot like John Keats.  Well, as a matter of fact, I might be related
to him on my mother's brother's other side - in 1962, if some of
you Listee Poetics Old-Timers Remember those Days, I receive (cieved)?
a letter from a Fanny Kitt (of Dance With Me Henry Fame?), who wrote
to me, personally, (me)to say that she was related also to Jim Keats
on her bum father's side.  So there you have it.  Next paragraph.

    Paragraph #2. Hey, cool, these poets, their names start with B or J,
they are three feet tall & they are on tour in your region, so hey.

    #3.  Reading Report:  Liz Chamse & Pete Harlington read to a smallish
but plucky audience of 5 last night & wowed them with lines like these:

"sound off maybe but there are pliable discrepancies"
"my name is poet and then transgressive bit my left toet"

so hey.

Number Four. Lucia Petroglyph is deep into her bileogryphon of Jim
Clesius, the reflective mirror of Albany who rewrote a series of paradise
lists using the pseudonym of Mermaid Hellville (get it?) while on lithium
and we have the complete etc. email so or call me Bernard if you're in town.
I have the money.  Forget Luke's station wagon - ok?  I have the money.
I am sick of these arguments with you.  Please backchannel!!!!!

DZ: From my point of view, the insensitivity of a *particular* speaker
[or even of quite a few such speakers] doesn't invalidate *every* use
[or even most uses] of "he" as a 'universal' singular pronoun. I agree
absolutely that, in the example you offer, if the *woman* from Wales did
the research, the speaker revealed himself as a buffoon, but the
behavior of idiots ought not constrain the behavior of non-idiots.

DZ: Did the use of the feminine pronoun sweep away the injustices of
such disenfranchisement? Hardly. And, of course, the terms of a job
posting ought to remain gender-neutral; I've never argued otherwise, on
this list or elsewhere.

DZ: "Pretty much universally granted... that [such] texts... ought to be
changed..."? What -- "20 million Frenchmen [sic] can't be wrong"? What
-- surgery on Huck Finn? The Nigger of the Narcissus? Little Black
Sambo? How about The Brothers Grimm? How about that violent, sexist
"Homer" guy? This strikes me as akin to the arrogance of conquerors who
immediately melt down the coinage & reissue it with their own likenesses
Ozymandias'd on it. Besides, why remove the petards upon which the
bigots of the past hoisted themselves?
  Further: how would you feel about future generations 'sanitizing'
*your* writing if it offended their sensibilities in ways you never
suspected at the time you wrote the text? Do you tacitly subscribe to
as-yet-unimagined agendas & their redactionary excisions?
Remember Hippocrates: "do no harm." "Physician, heal thyself."

DZ: I agree with you that the first two examples reveal massive and
lamentable insensitivity on the speakers' parts; however, I believe that
your response to "what man has written" reveals a minor, though also
lamentable, hypersensitivity on your part.

DZ: To quote Ed Sanders: "I don't give a pound of mule mucus" for what
"most" people think, and neither should any poet, for Godsake! *Most*
southerners thought black people subhuman; did that make them correct?!
This crap about "most" demonstrates the absolutely "politically correct"
nature of this argument, despite the efforts of those who make it to
dissociate themselves from that now politically incorrect phrase.

DZ: I still see s/he [and almost all such -- especially multiple --
proliferations of multiply gendered pronoun usage] as flamin', freakin'
*ugly* [a derivative of legalese], but I agree wholeheartedly with your
pen & sword example as perfectly sensible and sensitive.

DZ: *I* don't see the Frankensteinization of pronouns as painless; it
makes me wince, blow chunks, wonder why we've called in the witch [OK:
witch/warlock] doctor to recite the Mass backwards, banish the bad boys,
pitchfork the monster with another monster [the 'democratic' mass of the
vilagers?], fight fire with fire. [Sure: give me all the shit y'all want
to about the "Mass" comment, as if I mean to suggest something about the
'sacredness' of language, but let me go on record that I don't.]
    My objections to these usages derive, on a day to day basis [as I've
said before], not so much from hearing colleagues use gendered pronouns
insensitively [mine, happily, tend to respect each other for their
intellects and their commitment to helping students, regardless of any
qualifications of gender or gender-orientation], as from reading papers
by my students marred [yes, marred] by the idiocies of PC pronoun usage
demanded of them by dimwitted highschool teachers who actually grade
them down if they don't obey the PC injunctions anent pronomial
rectitude, the shitheads! No one should treat students that way, and I
make no apologies about saying so often and publically.

Bless you brothers; bless you sisters./

Subject:      More Announcements on the list, Please!
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A primary purpose of this list is the exchange of information on readings,
books and magazines related to poetry. From my point of view as the list
organizer, there is nothing that is posted on this list that this more
important than these announcements. All those who edit, publish, organize
or wish to recommend such publications or events are not only invited to
list them here, but encouraged. Indeed, I know there are a number of
subscribers who have not listed recent publications and I would ask them,
as part of their participation in the list, to please do so.

The form of these announcements is left entirely up to those making them,
but certainly simple listings are fine, more elaborate presentations are
also useful (with blurbs, quotes, etc.). I know many also appreciate the
discounts offered over the list -- though I for one tend to wince when I
see them, because when you do the math, you realize that they also involved
a significant loss for the presses making them.

This brings up a more general question on the list, which Joel and I have
been discussing in response to notes we have received from list
participants. Some of these issues are easy to address: for example please
do not send messages over the list that would more appropriate to be sent
to one or two individuals (and of course I am not referring to those
messages sent out to whole list inadvertently, since many of us make such
mistakes from time to time). Also, please do resend the whole announcement
to which you are responding; it can be useful to include some edited
excerpts, but better just the new message than a resending of the entire
previous message. And of course No Attachments should be sent to the list.

The more general issue is harder to address, since generalization spoils
the point. Some of the posts I most enjoy are short and often funny
responses to previous posts -- so any general comment about "chat" messages
would miss a problem I do see. Yet, some short posts would probably be
better off backchannel or consolidated into longer, more substantial messages.

Joel and I  will be sending out the Welcome Message again soon, as it is
the end of the month. I hope that all list participants will reread this

dan, what really bugs me about this exchange on pronouns is that---well,
based on your posts to poetix right along, you've always struck me as a
sensible, reasonable, ETC., man... i wondering whether in fact this
discussion hasn't polarized you in some way?...

but hey:  first off, nobody is advocating going back and altering the
historical record... e.g., rewriting literary texts to draw them into align
with some newer sensibility regarding pronominal deployment (or
whatever)... the *threat* that this might happen, it seems to me, is part
of the *reaction* to the (feminist) suggestion that we modify current
pronoun usage (i.e., it crops up now and again, this fear, whenever i've
had this discussion)... which is to say:  if "sanitizing" the past (however
defined) is a fear of yours, i would ask that you please
substantiate/corroborate said fear... which won't be corroborated, btw,
merely by observing that many are now calling for new language in
contemporary documents (such as making legal tracts user-friendly in this
regard---which hasn't, unfortunately, been very successful)... or by
observing that some folks want a version of the bible, say, altered
accordingly (b/c we all know how "the book" is modified to serve a vast
number of ends)...

secondly:  are you actually denying that centuries of using he (etc.) as a
presumably ungendered 'universal' has had *zero* impact on the way 'we'
think about what that he (etc.) signifies? (incl. various exclusivities)...
say it ain't so, dan, please---say it ain't so... and please to note that
my usage of 'we' includes he's and she's...

finally:  you're making what seems to me a questionable yet telling
critical move by resisting the proposed/new usage on the basis of aesthetic
evaluation---i.e., "ugly" (vs., i assume, "beautiful")... i mean, "ugly"
carries such negative connotations... to introduce a she/her/hers
occasionally is "ugly"?---i know you don't *mean* it as a reflection of
your feelings regarding men or women per se... but, but, to designate an
occasional variation from he (etc.) as "ugly," well hey:  seems to me one
(esp. she) is inclined to observe that, by sheer default, he (etc.) becomes
"beautiful," no?...

and this becomes itself a further example of how he (etc.) signifies in
curious ways, no?... or is the power of association, generally, to be
utterly discounted here?...

best,

joe

i don't think you get it; the use of the masculine pronoun to indicate
universality IS an injustice of such a disenfranchisement, so using the
feminine where appropriate does indeed "sweep it away," or at least go some
measure toward redressing the historical occlusion.

Gee, Aldon*, I wonder who wrote that note, using my name and e-mail
address, unless the M&D Interview really stuck in Charles' craw... As I
told him, I ran a modest disclaimer in the recent issue of M&D, but
since I'm having production/distribution problems and low funds, I've
been slow to release it. So for the benefit of those who give a pound of
"mule's mucous," here's the note, with modest disclaimer, I wrote
preceding said issue:

Hoa Nguyen has joined the Younger Poet staff as an editor. She steps in
to help with the joyful task of producing a quarterly packed with
friends, masters and the random (and welcome) pieces that land in our
mailbox each month. * Also, for those who could have possibly read the
ŒBernstein Interview¹ in issue 9 as the ³real McCoy,² that was a
complete forgery (cf. Ted Berrigan on John Cage). I thought the extreme
self-consciousness of that gesture, among other rather Œobvious¹
elements, would reveal that satire for what it was. Still, pickles to
Chas Beanstein. * In other, more pressing news, government accountants
are tallying losses to the weapons inventory this weekend, having
launched million-dollar-a-piece Tomahawk missiles, finally sending New
World technology to needy 3rd World recipients. * WANTED: Socialites and
Gangpods. We have started a sub-sub-poetics list (call it sub-sub for
short). Anyone who enjoys wearing a purple fez and monocles may apply to
List Meister Smith to receive initiation to the secret order. First
topic of debate: how to address issues of race and gender through the
eyes of a koala bear (so cute, stoned and fluffy!). *  ³Poets, we are
going deep into a mineshaft, and it¹s lights-out for us first. (Keep
those peepers open)!² ‹ Wilfred Hoofclaw III * Finally, I¹ll leave you
with a transcription of Austin artist Philip Trussell¹s recent dream
from June 17, 1998:





                WCW¹s 3 strict

Uh, I was kinda reluctant to announce this, but for anyone who's not
completely wiped out by the last day of the conference, and who can get up
at 8:30, I'm chairing a panel on "Queer Walter Scott"--yes, yes, nothing
to do with poetics or poetry, but some good papers nonetheless.

I just actually signed up to Poetics, and thought what a great way to
solicit abstracts and papers for a panel I want to put together for the
1999-MLA, Chicago (per Charles Bern -stein's comment about advertising
conferences and what not).

The other night Ron Silliman and Karen Mac Cormack gave a reading at
Stanford, and on the way to dinner (I drove in Ron's car) we got to
talking about the Poetics discussion list and the Electronic Poetry
homepage.  I had known about Poetics for awhile, but never did sign-up.
Well ....

Anway, if I may:  if there is anyone interested in presenting a paper on
Postmoder Genres (for the MLA), I would greatly be interested in seeing
abstracts or papers.  I have already sent in a blurb for the Winter MLA
Notes and the Call for Papers (CPF) web site at www.
english.upenn.edu/CFP/, but thought Poetics might be a good place too.

I am a graduate student at Stanford, working with Marjorie Perloff.  My
dissertation is on the place of the interview in the arts and theory.  I
have chapters on painters, poets, prose novelists, architects and
theorists.

Anway, papers or abstracts rergarding video art, talk shows, the
interview, contemporary poetry, prose, painting, architecture, music or
theory would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

George writes that he wants to sell his Bromige books. Is that so?! Well,
then,I'd like to unload my Bowering collection. But I have a question. Each
time he holographs something to me in a book of his, he writes "Not for
Resale." Does this increase the value?

 Also, in my copy of _Blonds on Bikes_, which I picked up for a song
("Sisters of Mercy," sung to bookseller Renee Rodin) + CAN$7 in a downtown
Vancouver bookshop, GB, outraged--the cover price is CAN$17--wrote "this is
for my old pal"--then crossed out every letter after the "f". Does this
increase the value? Because, if so, I can cross out portions of his other
dedicative holographings. In the books I stole, I shall of course x out
everything.

_Blonds on Bikes_ is actually a really good read (not least for the
contributions by GB's wife Angela), but I've photocopied it on the Dept
machine, so I don't need it any more.

 What's an even better read is Bowering's latest novel, _Piccolo Mondo_,
available from Coach House Books in Toronto, also for a song (" Brother
[Sister],Can You Spare a Dime?"). An even better read, that is, if you're
interested in the scurrilous beings and doings of GB's extraordinarily
prolonged youth (but nothing about those later, MLA, parties, Maria and
Rachel and Eliza).

Btw, if you want to p.u. my early works from George, the song I suggest is
"I Get a Kick Out Of You." I always do.

        A related question for increasing mubers of people livving in the
USA is racial  identity.  For example on how many forms are you asked your
racial identity only to find that you have a limited number of choices:
Black, White, Hispanic, American Indian/Eskimo, Asian--yet millions of
people are like myself mixed race--so where does one find one's
place here?
        Dichotomous, either/or thinking, classification, labelling and so
on limits one severely and seems absurd, an imposition of grids on areas
that move as  shifting, living  rivers.
        Last night Leonard Shlain, author of the new book The Alphabet
versus the Goddess gave a talk and book promo here in Milwaukee. I live
neqrby so stopped in to hear him--also read quite a bit of the book
earlier--
        His thinking is very much either/or:  left brain/right brain,
liner/intuitive, masculine, feminin and so on.  The advent of written and
particularly printed
texts is continually correlated with the predominance of left brain,
linear, masciuline thought and domination.
        As a visual poet I of course questioned a number of his
assumptions, asking him if he was aware of what visual poets have essayed
for thousands of years--and, this being the Centennial of Mallarme's "UB
COUP DE DES"--usually considered as the "beginning" of "modern' Western
visual poetry--9if he was aware of such work, which is not eithor/or but
both/and--again, non-dichotomous.
        An example in nature is light--which is both particle and wave.
(Shlain looks more at long waves at the expense of particles, admitting
himself he has not used the question of location, of local movements and
so on which are so crucial in the thinking of many today, wheteher
influenced by Foucalut, Deleuaze and Guattari, Feminist thinkers and
writers, ethnic movements, grass roots movements and so on--or just by
walking around and being aware of one's location here--this site--
        Many of the arguments against either/or thought --as Shlain's
written text and "mastery"--he's a surgeon and also wrote a book on Art
and Physics--ironically  use the very rational, linear thinking they
deplore to demonstrate their theses condeming it for its violations
throughout history of women, the right brain, justice and equality for
all . . .
        The point, again, is division, categorization and, in Shlain's
case, a mix of science, feel good pop psychology and Mew Ageisms which
appropriates the idea of "difference" at the expense of erasing any
"difference" which is not "mixed" but simply a systematic way of
emphasizing difference to better control.
        The side kick of this emphasis on difference is an erasure of
difference at the expense of not only of the "mixed" but also of local
differences at the expense of lump differences.  Am example would be the
"Pan-Indian" New Age concepts of of American Indians and cultures,
traditions, styles, histories and beliefs--at the exoense of recognizing
difference among living Indians.
        Of course the question of pronouns is "significant"--language is
used to shape images and behaviours.  The question agin, though, gets
turned into another dichotomy: get rid of that which emphasizes to an
extreme degree difference and replace it with what is "neutral".  (Or as
some joker pointed out, "neutered".)
        The problem with neatralizing/neutering is that at some p[oint it
destorys the
"mixed"--
        A striking excample somewaht debated on this list a year ago was
the question of Visual Poetry.  Marjorie Perloff wanted suggestions  (as
did as I recall Jena Osman) for texts to be used n teaching a Grad Seminar
on Visual Poetry.  Bob Grumman especially made many suggestions--and
others as well passed on a few--
        In th end, Perloff's texts were a few monuments--Mallarme,
Apollinaire--the Solt  anthology of Concrete Poetry from the early
Seventies--and then a slew of "language centered" writers who have
produced texts that present  very narrow, attentuated examples of "visual
poetry" emp[hasizing language rather than the conjunctions and
interrelationships among visual and word elemnts and their movements
with sound, physical movement, performance----work quite different from
the visual poetry Grumman had recommended.
        (Concerning the latter aspects of Visual Poetry--in relation to
the use of texts as scores--see Karl Young's great essay "Notation and
the Art of Reading" at Light and Dust web site
        http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm
        Again, an example of the appropriation of (mixed) "difference"
(visual
poetry) at the expoense of the differences and mixings which is the
activity of visual poetry for the majority of visual poets practising
around the world today and examples of which are not that difficult to
find.
        The quest for the neutral can be as dangerous as the quest for
dichotomies--the drive seems to be propelled at some point by
exclusivity--
        So the question remains . . .to be worked WITH . . . as both
particle and wave--

I want to make it clear that the early bromige books I have for sale cheap
include the ones he wrote and published under his pseudonyms (at least he
claimed that they were his, and who could doubt such a dignified-looking
man. I mean, he looked dignified when he was 25 and claimed to be 21). I
have three signed copies of _The Heads of the Town up to the Aether_, for
example, which he published under another name in the early 60s. He said
that he used another name on this book because he did not want to flood the
market, having just published another book called _The Oprning of the
Field_. I have 4 copies of that, signed by Mr bromige. Boy, could he write
in those days!

Corrolaries to Murphy's Law:

1. If anyone can misunderstand, he probably will.
2. If anyone can misunderstand, she probably will.
3. If anyone can misunderstand, he or she probably will.

If anyone prefers 3. to 1. or 2., he or she certainly has every right to
adopt it for his or her use, especially if doing so will make him or her
feel truer to himself or herself regarding his or her beliefs about what
he or she considers his or her social or other responsibility.

DZ: Thank you for giving me the benefit of the doubt, Joe. & yeah, I
guess I do feel a bit polarized [even frostbitten, given some of the
retorts I've read]. Rather than keep this running longer than the Starr
snoop, I'll try to keep my responses as brief as possible.

DZ: Well, right: I don't really 'fear' such rewriting, since like
[almost?] everyone else, I'd see it as merely absurd; indeed, I used
that example of rewriting the past as an analogy for the absurdity I see
in some people's call for a similar rewrite of the present: people like
the dimwit teachers I referred to in earlier posts who [I didn't make
this up!] penalize students who fail to 'get with the program' -- a
program which produces sentences like the one above, following the
Corrolaries to Murphy's Law.  NB: I doubt that such teachers have smarts
enough to have noticed any but the most blatant & inappropriate uses of
"he" as oppposed to "she" or "he or she." I think it took a brilliant &
well-meaning Victor Frankenstein [aka Mary Shelley] to create such a
hodgepodge as himself/herself or s/he, and to make such people not only
notice it, but codify it into a credo. [Certainly Shelley didn't
actually *advocate* Victor's experiment!]  Does that make me one of the
terrified villagers-cum-pitchfork? I don't believe so, but I do think
that Vic had a Not Terribly Good Idea, and that lots of people who teach
writing don't recognize that.

DZ: No, I suppose it may have had some impact on some people some of the
time, but I also suppose it remained pretty irrelevant compared to the
often bloody attempts to gain recognition for the dignity of all people
or all genders & all et ceteras. I wonder how this works in other
languages. One of my Polish students told me yesterday that this problem
doesn't crop up in her native language [does it? any Polish speakers out
there?]. I guess a way to test this Whorfian hypothesis would involve
finding languages which don't use gendered pronouns, or which prefer the
feminine pronoun, & then see whether males dominate/oppress females in
those societies.
   My own objection to the [as I've stressed, though no one seems to
notice] obsessive, repetitive, and excessive knee-jerk/totalizing use of
multigendered pronouns has *nothing* to do with whether they've *had*
any [I assume you mean oppressive] "impact" on anyone [though I don't at
all deny that one can *see* them as *reflecting* the negative impact
which deliberate social practices have had and, sadly, continue to have
on people]. My objections remain
   1. Aesthetic: you, if memory serves, wondered how I, as a poet, could
display such insensitivity to language as to object to the s/heification
of the father/mother tongue. I might ask how you, as a poet, can regard
such inanities as my sample sentence above [& the horse it rode in on,
by the way] as sensitive! Would you, a poet, actually recommend that
anyone write such a sentence? This stuff just strikes me as ugly. Yes,
ugly. A matter of taste. De gustibus non est disputandam.
   2. Philosophical: in an earlier post, I mentioned William of Ockham's
injunction "not to multiply entities beyond necessity" -- the "razor."
It seems to me a pretty good principle. Rigorously systematic use of
s/he-isms appears to multiply entities beyond necessity by relying on
global mimesis to achieve a point when a single direct statement would
do [e.g., "an equal opportunity employer"]. Therefore I asked [about as
facetiously, I thought, as Mary Shelley might have 'advocated' the
creation of Frankenstein's monster] whether the use of s/he-isms has
caused reforms [e.g., suffrage, equal pay]. It seems to me that though
"the pen is mightier than the sword," that might works like a scalpel,
whereas the word-magic of s/he-ism works either like a neutron bomb, or
about as effectively as "take an aspirin and call me in the morning." I
do not see it as satyagraha. I see it as "I'm rubber; you're glue..."
   3. Linguistic: "the map is not the teritory," linguists say. They
don't think much of "prescriptivism," either, despite the French
Academy.
   Very few listees have responded to these, my previously stated
reasons for my views on this matter. Some have preferred to attack me
personally, to question my 'sensitivity,' to lecture me on chauvinism,
&c. Have I made enemies? I hope not; I have great regard for all of you.
Have you made me an enemy by confusing your inferences with what I've
actually said? Again, I hope not; I've tried to state my views
explicitly. I will continue to do so -- though not, I hope [as I expect
you do as well], on the present topic].

DZ: But, Joe! I do NOT "designate an occasional variation from he (etc.)
as "ugly"! Where did you *get* that idea? I've said *repeatedly* that
feminine pronouns make sense *when* they make sense, but not at other
times, and I've agreed that it makes *no* sense to refer to a woman as
"he"! I've also said it makes sense to use "he or she" when really
appropriate or necessary -- I just think it necessary far less often
than some listees evidently do, and I've said why.

Thanks again for engaging in this discussion with me.

Best,

Dan

Subject:      Re: dead Huckster Society

I just want to add my two cents worth to the chorus of voices raised in
support of book/pub/sales/readings/tours/ notices.  In a capitalistic
consumertistic and very autistic tistic society much like the one we
all happen unfortunately today (tonight, I should say) share, we need
to know this.  We need to know this.  We need to know this.  And I
say "we" fully conscious as I am of the transgressive nature of pronouns,
not to mention the gressive nature of nouns or the ive nature of
post-participles or the trans- nature of pluperfect gender specific
pasta with tomato sauce, which I like very much, thank you Mr. Bowering,
Mr. Bromide, Ms. Damon, Mr. Fixit, and all the other "personalities" who
grace this particular drone of grammar.  And while I'm "here" let me just
say that I think poetry is great, and whatever Mr. Ribot says, we should
try to maintain a sense of humid - dry humid if possible - and not talk
TOO much about "serious" issues of phraseology or politics, and I really
sense a consensus of sensuality on that issue, male, female, brick or
cement.  Has anyone - to raise a positive note of "interest" - read the
jambon-gombons coming out of Iran lately?  You can find them - IF you're
into multiglobal developments - at http://http.http.http.[infinity],
and if anyone has any info on Fred Chlzizkiewickza's translations
of this mode I would love to hear from you - backchannel preferred but
not a legal requirement in most countries.  & while we're on this subject,
has anyone read Pearl Dwarf's new work out of Clim Press in Fargo?
Astounding stuff - and I mean, STUFF!!  Dwarf comes out of a quilting
bee tradition - quite native to the Indiana flatlands south of de border -
and intercalates poetry with found objects like knitting needles,
hay, old pepsi bottlecaps, and photos of Geritol roadsigns - MASSIVE
I mean - these works if you can call them that are over 300 square
miles large!  One of Dwarf's poems actually STIFLED Jelworth County,
IL in three horrific hours of mayhem!  [Halloween, 1995] NEA $$$,
forget it, baby!  Let's organize!
