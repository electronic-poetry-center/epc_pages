Welcome to the (new) Poetics List!

Numerous changes have been made in the list format, and
both old and new subscribers will want to look at the revised
Welcome Message for details of those changes. Foremost
is that the list is now =fully moderated=; with the corollary that,
with 600+ subscribers, Poetics can no longer be a discussion
list as such. We've decided, for the time being, to restrict list
traffic to event/publication announcements, though in future
we may be accepting event and "scene" reports, book reviews,
statements/responses and the like, as well as a limited amount
of somewhat more informal correspondence.

The list is also coming online with a new editorial staff,
consisting principally of me, whom many of you will recognize
from this list or other poetry-related contexts. I'm looking forward
to working on this list, which has been very useful to me in the
past. Cheers,

     Christopher W. Alexander


A copy of this message and the (new) Welcome Message will
go out shortly to notify those set to "nomail" of the changes.

Above the world-weary horizons New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold, O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List was founded by Charles Bernstein in late 1993
with the epigraph above. Now in its second incarnation, the list
carries over 600 subscribers, though all of these subscribers do
not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A number of
other people read the Poetics List via our web archives at the
Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list, as articulated in this Welcome Message. We remain committed
to this editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics
List. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions
in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and
investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise
unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

=3DThe Poetics List is no longer a discussion list as such.=3D Due
to the increasing number of subscribers and the need for close
moderation, we are no longer able to maintain the open format
with which the list began. Rather, we encourage subscribers to
post information on publications and reading series that they
have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear.
Such announcements constitute a core function of this list. For
further information on posting to the list, see section 5 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your real name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list must provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include
all of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, simply re-subscribe to the list
(once your account problem has been resolved!) by sending
this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, submissions relating to politics and political news
will also be considered. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential.

Unsolicited submissions are welcome. In particular, we encourage
subscribers to post information on publications and reading
series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in
which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function
of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g., event
reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).
Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate;
we request that the posting subscriber assemble "highlights"
from respondents' posts to be published to the list. *PLEASE
NOTE: All submissions should be sent to the poetics list at
<poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>, and not to the editors.*

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) will
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List must abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual
subscribers address.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or thank
someone for posting something you requested, please send the
request or comment directly to that individual, and not to the
list editors.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text". Note,
however, there is no problem with sending clickable URLs in
HTML format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents in a post, since this may make it difficult for
those who get the list via "digest" or who cannot decode
attached or specially formatted files. The use of "styled"
text or HTML formatting in the body of email posts to the
list appears not to be compatible with the the list's
automatic digest program; as a result such messages disrupt
the format of the Digest, even though this coding is
readable for some subscribers who do not use the digest
option.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

      set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://writing.upenn.edu/epc>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://writing.upenn.edu/epc>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

-------------------

10. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: The Electronic Poetry Center listings of
poetry and poetics information is open and available to you. We
are trying to make access to printed publications as easy as
possible for our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate!

Send a list of your press/publications to
<glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu>, with the words EPC Press Listing in
the subject line.

You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail
message to the address above to obtain a mailing address to
which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your word
processor will save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is
also highly desirable.

Send us extended information on new publications (including any
back cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs or
backlists (including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).
Be sure to include full information for ordering--including prices
and addresses and phone numbers both of the press and any
distributors.

You might also want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics List as subscribers do not always (or ever)
check the EPC; in your message please include full  information for
ordering. If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention
that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have
received a noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to
promote your publication and we are glad to facilitate information
about interesting publications.

Small Press Traffic presents

Peter Gizzi
Susan Thackrey

Friday, January 15, 7:30 p.m.
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street, San Francisco
$5

We jump into 1999 with the inimitable Peter Gizzi, whose new book
Artificial Heart (Burning Deck) shows him off at his absolute best, as a
supple and lyrical poet who can make anything happen with words. His poetry
is playful, mathematical, highly constructed and romantic, like that
Chinese nightingale in Yeats' Byzantium poems, but living and sentient, a
hot line to the real. Peter Gizzi was born in 1959 and grew up in
Pittsfield, Massachusetts. His editing projects have included the
celebrated little magazine O.Blek: A Journal Of Language Arts (1987-93),
the international literary anthology the Exact Change Yearbook (1995), and
The House That Jack Built: The Collected Lectures Of Jack Spicer (Wesleyan,
1998). He lives in Santa Cruz and teaches literature and creative writing
for the University of California.

Susan Thackrey has long been a fixture of the Bay Area art and poetry
scene, and her admirers have waited for fifteen years for the release of
her first book, Empty Gate, now available from Berkeley's terrific
Listening Chamber press. Empty Gate is a pungent distillation of experience
and uncertainty; its short little lines, serial notation, and hints of
mythic grandeur are homeopathic in their simplicity and efficacy.
Thackrey's poetry has been published in Acts, Apex of the M, Avec,
Talisman, and Hambone.  She owned and ran an art gallery and has published
critical writing on film and photography in Cinemagraph and Afterimage.
During the early days of New College's Poetics Program, Susan Thackrey
studied with Robert Duncan; his ghost will be walking the halls of New
College tonight during this great event.

>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>Fred Hopkins, widely acknowledged in avant-garde circles as one of the most
>fiercely talented, charismatic and original bassists in modern jazz, died
>Thursday at the University of Chicago Hospital. He was 51. The cause of
>death was heart-related. Further details were not disclosed.
>
>
>A South Side native who moved back to his hometown in 1997 after more than
>20 years in New York, Mr. Hopkins was best known for his work in Air, an
>acclaimed trio. Formed in 1975 in New York, it included saxophonist Henry
>Threadgill and drummer Steve McCall, with whom he had played in the
>early-1970s Chicago group, Reflection.
>
>
>An integral part of later Threadgill groups, Mr. Hopkins worked regularly
>with such major figures as Muhal Richard Abrams, David Murray, Anthony
>Braxton and Don Pullen. His stature is reflected in his presence on dozens
>of important recordings.
>
>
>A product of Capt. Walter Dyett's famed music program at Du Sable High
>School, Mr. Hopkins trained with the Civic Orchestra and later studied the
>bass with Joseph Guastafeste of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
>
>
>A free-spirited, hard-living, effusively outspoken individual, he brought a
>carefree brilliance to his playing, which featured sometimes outlandish
>bowing effects. He prided himself on being able to play in diverse settings,
>counting among his important influences the classical bassist (and
>conductor) Serge Koussevitsky as well as jazz bassists Wilbur Ware, Richard
>Davis and Ray Brown.
>
>
>``What you want to do is express yourself on your instrument, to share your
>thoughts about sound,'' he said in an interview last year, having just
>formed his first band as a leader. ``But doing that has gotten me in
>trouble. The more creative I become, the more people try to tell me how to
>play. Well, listen, no one is going to tell me how to play the bass. That's
>what I do.''
>
>
>``He was one of the most fascinating soloists on the bass I have ever
>heard,'' said trumpeter Malachi Thompson. ``His total approach was so
>unique. He's one of those artists who can't be replaced because to even try
>to do what he did is impossible.''
>
>
>Mr. Hopkins is survived by his mother and six siblings. Funeral arrangements
>were being planned."

Coach House Books and the Red Head Gallery invite you to strike a blow
against Official Verse Culture by attending the launch of two new books of
poetry:

FIT TO PRINT by Alan Halsey and Karen Mac Cormack

dyslexicon by Stephen Cain

19 January 1999
8 pm
The Red Head Gallery
96 Spadina Avenue, 8th floor

Authors Karen Mac Cormack and Stephen Cain will be in attendance. Steve
McCaffery will be playing the part of Alan Halsey for the evening. New work
by painter Jason Dunda will be on display.

Cash bar. Snacks will be served (but don't make a pig of yourself).


ABOUT THE BOOKS

Hallmark Cards aficionados beware: these are not collections of lyrical
verse.

FIT TO PRINT, a first-time collaboration for UK poet Halsey and Toronto
poet Mac Cormack, is a tour-de-force work which poeticizes the most
quotidian of literary forms: the newspaper column. FIT TO PRINT serves as
eloquent proof of Marshall McLuhan's suggestion that to read a newspaper is
to experience Cubism in the everyday world.

dyslexicon, small press regular Stephen Cain's first full-length book, is a
double-lunged bong hit of mid-Eighties post-punk college rock, Gertrude
Stein, art films, and the comedic legacy of Laurel and Hardy (including
such great standup teams as Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett, HD and Ezra
Pound, Jesus and Judas, and Steve McCaffery and bpNichol).


ABOUT THE AUTHORS

Stephen Cain currently resides in Toronto,where he is editor of Kitsch in
Ink Press and a member of the (n-1) Collective. Previous chapbooks have
appeared from fingerprinting inkorporated and above/ground presses. His
visual and concrete poetry has appeared in Rampike, Torque, 1cent (Canada,
and Essex (US). Cain is also completing a doctorate in English Literature
at York University, specializing in Modern and Contemporary Poetics.

Alan Halsey's books include Perspectives On The Reach (1981), Five Years
Out (1989), Reasonable Distance (1992), The Text of Shelley'sDeath (1995)
and A Robin Hood Book (1996). He was born in London, England in 1949, and
now lives in Sheffield.

Karen Mac Cormack was born in Luanshya, Zambia in 1956. She is the author
of seven books of poetry, including Straw Cupid (1987), Quirks & Quillets
(1991), Marine Snow (1995), and The Tongue Moves Talk (1997). Of dual
British/Canadian citizenship, she lives in Toronto.

Granary Books announces a new publication:


=46iguring the Word: Essays on Books, Writing and Visual Poetics collects
diverse writings by Johanna Drucker previously published in literary
and scholarly journals. Topics include: "The Word Made Flesh," "Writing
as Artifact," "Visual Poetics," "Artists' Books Past and Future," "The
=46uture of Writing," & "Personal Writing." The book also includes an
anecdotal checklist of Drucker's artists's books and an informative
introduction by poet Charles Bernstein.


"Figuring the Word is a work of poetics rather than criticism or theory
in that these essays are the products of doing as much as thinking, of
printing as much as writing, of designing as much as researching, of
typography as much as composition, of autobiography as much as theory.
The mark of the practitioner-critic is everywhere present in these
pieces=8AFiguring the Word is a wide-ranging collection of Drucker's
essays from the early-80's to the present. Written in a variety of
styles and presented in a variety of formats, the book reflects many
divergent aspects of her work and thinking, while at the same time
demonstrating how cohesive her project has been. Drucker begins with a
wonderfully digressive discussion of her work as a book artist in which
she gives an account of what lead her not only to her book art, but
also to her related scholarly investigations. She then provides a
series of close readings of the work of a number of contemporary
language artists, providing in other essays overviews of  the
historical precedents for this work. The book includes not only a
perceptive essay about the use of language in the landscape but also a
prescient essay about the use of language in the new electronic
frontier of cyberspace."


-from the introduction by Charles Bernstein, Poet, Editor and David
Gray Professor of Poetry and Poetics at SUNY-Buffalo.



Johanna Drucker has been making books since 1972. She teaches.... Her
recent critical publications include The Century of Artists Books

The editors of the William Blake Archive
<http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake/> are pleased to announce the
opening of a major new wing of the site, devoted to documentation and
supplementary materials "About the Archive." Available as the first
entry on our main table of contents page from the URL above, the "About
the Archive" materials consist of:

A brief overview of the Archive for first-time or hurried users,
entitled The Archive at a Glance;

A statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology;

A Technical Summary of the Archive's design and implementation;

A Frequently Asked Questions list;

A reference page listing articles by members of the project team,
as well as reviews and notices of the Archive by others;

An updated and expanded version of the article-length Plan of the
Archive, providing additional detail about our intentions with regard to
Blake's non-illuminated works.

Also included is information about the editors, an account of the
Archive's collaboration with the Institute for Advanced Technology in
the Humanities, and a link to our extensive Help documentation. In
addition, we will shortly be adding a Tour of the Archive to these
materials (combining textual narration, graphical screenshots, and
suggestions as to how to use the Archive).

Prophecy_, _The Book of Thel_, and _Visions of the Daughters of Albion_,
as well as further copies of the separate and combined _Songs_ and the

summer, thus completing the illuminated canon.  This spring we will also
be releasing the electronic Erdman edition in beta form and publishing
detailed lists documenting the complete contents of the various U.S. and
U.K. Blake collections (now nine of them) contributing works to the
Archive.

Finally, we list below the electronic editions already in the Archive

THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM
A play by Kevin Killian and Rex Ray

In a last-ditch effort to stave off cancellation by the network, two
producers of a sagging TV game show (THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM, kind of like
JEOPARDY with vegetable questions) decide to switch its format to CELEBRITY
VK, and try to enroll Linda McCartney and Yoko Ono as their celebrity
contestants.  Linda, holed up in her Meatless Mystery Ranch in Tucson,
Arizona, dying of cancer, surrounded by her loyal staff of robots and
animals, decides to take them up on their offer, believing that America is
ready for evangelical vegetarianism.  Yoko Ono, brooding over the career of
her son, Sean, and the wayward history of the Fluxus movement, flies in
from New York to Hollywood to appear on the program.  Neither of them knows
the other is going to be her opponent.  War ensues both off-screen and on.
This is a play about forgiveness, redemption, repressed memory, and the
age-old question of how can we make this sorry old world a better place.

WORLD PREMIERE with Norma Cole, Kota Ezawa, Cliff Hengst, Scott Hewicker,
Kevin Killian, Karla Milosevich, Rex Ray, Larry Rinder, Jocelyn Saidenburg,
Mary Margaret Sloan and Wayne Smith.  Mary Margaret Sloan makes her acting
debut as Lee Meriweather, actress, former Miss America, former Catwoman on
Batman, etc., etc.  THIS PERFORMANCE FREE!

Subject:      Fence Volume 1, no. 2
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi, I wanted to tell you about Fence, Vol. I, no. 2, which includes, among
other things, a new poem by Charles Bernstein, one from Rosmarie Waldrop,
two from Jane Miller, several from Elizabeth Robinson, two from Brenda
Hillman, a series by Laura Mullen, two from Mary Jo Bang, art from Bruce
Conner, poems by Lee Ann Brown, a long section by C.D. Wright, a poem by
Chris Stroffolino, and several by Donald Revell.

As you can see from the above list, Fence is interested in publishing work
from the experimental mainstream as well as the academic mainstream--mixed
metaphors of barriers and water.

Because this is one of the few venues in which a Manifesto might be
well-received, I'd like to include our own, which was integral to the
conception of the magazine, but which has never been published anywhere due
to shyness and fear of jeering.

Please check out our website: www.fencemag.com

What follows is a Manifesto/Press Release:

                                FENCE

-- the skeleton of a wall, the embodiment of a line...
-- a pause between fields and a conduit for pleasure...
-- a structure at once transparent and definitive..

Fence is a new journal of poetry, fiction, criticism, and art.  Its editors
are writers, artists, participants in the cultural throng who are
dissatisfied with the stratified, self-consuming body of literary journals
available.  Our contributors are those whose work sits resolutely on the
fence, resisting easy definition.  We are convinced that mystery, as it is
manifested in the subjective voice, is a legitimate and pleasurable
by-product of the agency of the author.  We have devised a journal with an
explicit mission: if not to erase the lines as they are drawn, at least to
expose, defy, and recontextualize them for a new readership: the converted
reunited with the curious.

...a marker of territory
Fence is a response to a percieved need.  We wish to provide a reliable
home for the fence-sitters: those writers who are intent on following the
lead of what they truly hear as opposed to what they have heard before or
what they have read about and with which they hope to align themselves.

-- a willful ambiguity, an informed non-commitment
Fence is a resting place for work that we recognize by its singularity, its
reluctance to take a seat in any established camp, its insistence on the
reader's close attention to what is not already understood, digested,
judged.  Readers will be surprised and refreshed upon encountering in our
pages an editorial presence that is unusually self-conscious in its
attempts to contextualize, inform, and reciprocally reveal our contributors
to our readers -- to expose the skeletal cross-purpose of our document.

-- a shared boundary
We intend to be literally didactic, to enclose territory for an unhindered,
unburdened encounter with the discussion of theories, styles, histories,
movements, and tastes.  Fence offers its readers a richesse of literacy,
one that is populist not by virtue of condescension, but by its lack of
presumptions.

-- a vantage point from which to see, simultaneously, several shades of
green in the grass
There is nothing radical about this magazine.  We do not see the erection
of such a fence as a combative or exclusionary measure, but as a gesture of
cultivation.  Fence stands against the false obfuscation of the fruits of
our culture's labor, that which has been framed and sentenced to
inaccessability.  We seek, above all, to increase the reader's pleasure.

-- a midpoint between the acquisition and distribution of stolen goods
There is nothing impenetrable about the work being done today; it is in
response to what has come before, that which has been previously allowed;
it is now allowed.  Within the context of each issue of Fence we reinforce
the realm of possibility and contextualize our contributors within it.
Fence intentionally blurs the distinction between "difficulty" and
"accessibility," preferring instead to address a continuum of utterance.

-- a dashing exercise, a good humoured parry-and-thrust
Our editorial strategy is a balancing act, undertaken in a spirit of
inquiry rather than critique. From John Ashbery's poem "Soonest Mended":

                But the fantasy makes it ours, a kind of fence-sitting
                Raised to the level of an esthetic ideal

Taken entirely out of context, these lines refer to our own aim and
fantasy: to support poetry and fiction that is written without the safety
of received theory or streamlined tradition but wholly out of impulse,
knowledge, and the experience of necessity.

-- a dissemination point
We wish to preach dually to the converted and to the curious.  Our
criticism is immediate and intimate, attempting an explicit address.  We
hope to break down the wall which we feel has been interposed between the
reading public and the material of our individualities -- our poems, our
fiction -- and to build in its place a fence.

                              shuffaloff press
                  is pleased to announce the publication of


                              Line of Flight

                               fictions by
                              Bruce Comens


Robert Creeley writes:

"'There is nothing but thinking makes it so.' It is that persistent fact
which displaces the comforting reality of our usual worlds, making that
'otherwhere' a palpable, self-determining presence. The narrators of
these various fictions can only tell us that such _other_ is
persistently there -- as one turns into a physical tree, as a second
watches the shifting patrons at a cafe sketch one another into
pinned reflection, as a third tracks through an increasing vagueness of
streets until the wind drives 'to careen on up into the bank of gray
cloud overhead. And beyond: a pulse of blank white, before wind.'

"Singular, intently articulate, walled in with a boundless emptiness
it's determined to enter, this exceptional work attempts to trace its
proposals by means of parable, to tell again and again such
stories as that of Icarus, who here can fly without his father's
laboriously constructed wings, yet wears them nonetheless.  Where does
he go, then?  Even more--from where can one think he has come?"

                        Tramping the Bulrushes
                                 by
                            John Clarke

With typical generosity and good nature, Clarke probes crucial
questions about how we think authority. Initially published in his
newsletter, intent., this essay takes on various misprepresentations
of the legacy of Clarke's friend and teacher, Charles Olson and his
seminal contribution to the poetries of this century.

                           Robin Blaser

Blaser succintly and precisely delivers us into the mind of Robert
Duncan's poetry as it participates in the larger mind of America and,
as Blaser has it, "the particulars of our relations [to] what may be
called soul-making."

AN OPEN LETTER: JAKOBSON'S METALANGUAGE
by Lytle Shaw

Dear Steve,

I notice that in David Lehman's new book, Hal Sirowitz, the author of_My
Mother Said_ and _My Therapist Said_, gets included as a significant
descendant of the New York School.  This is strange and untrue.  By chance
I saw Sirowitz read lately and there was something quite funny and
completely limited about his work.  I've recently been interested in
poetries that chart speech acts--and linguistic practices more
broadly--within uneven power dynamics.  In Sirowitz's case, the
institutional frames of parent/child or therapist/patient relationships are
numbingly obvious: enunciation gets contained within an overly literalized
setting in which we watch a repertoire of more or less cliche, though at
times comic, pathologies.  But that more various relations to institutional
frames have been a basis for some of the most interesting poetics of the
last few years will be my way in, through the question of metalanguage, to
a consideration of what has happened to poetics in the forty years since
Roman Jakobson's excellent essay, "Linguistics and Poetics."  For Jakobson,
metalanguage shouldn't be understood only as a scientific tool; instead it
"plays also an important role in our everyday language" (69).  Now, in part
because of him, this seems obvious.  But for him there is no social moment
to the question:

<c>
"The sophomore was plucked."  "But what is _plucked_"  "_Plucked_ means the
same as _flunked_."  "And _flunked_?"  "_To be flunked is to fail an
exam._"  "And what is _sophomore?_" persists the interrogator innocent of
school vocabulary.  "_A sophomore_ is (or means) a _second-year student_."
All these equational sentences convey information merely about the lexical
code of English; their function is strictly metalingual.  Any process of
language learning, in particular child acquisition of the mother tongue,
makes wide use of such metalingual operation.  (69)
<xc>

The forty year gap allows us to feel comfortable asserting, unlike
Jakobson, that power inheres in the very form of most metalingual
statements: the seeming lack of origin of their "correct" answers; their
ability to switch on and off a set of social rules--are we talking to or
about?  To derail communication--or render it suddenly self-reflexive--is
itself an important social act.  Metalingual statements of the type
Jakobson cites work to naturalize uneven power relations by placing them
within secure, seemingly objective, categories--here between student and
professor.  Moreover, metalanguage's entrance into everyday language
provides one of the most basic opportunities to chart the working of
social-linguistic codes, what we would now call--in a vast, rough
translation of linguistic insights toward the social sciences Jakobson
couldn't help but pronounce unrigorous!--power codes.  Metalingual
statements have the unique ability to render palpable the _social frames_
of a speaking situation or more generally a situation of one's encounter
with language.  They render perceptible the linguistic basis of coded power
relationships.  Perhaps we are so comfortable asserting all of this that
simply to assert it is no longer enough.

Of course, claiming that one of poetry's main functions is to explore
metalanguage flies directly in the face of Jakobson--at least on the
surface.  He writes:  Poetry and metalanguage ... are in diametrical
opposition to each other: in metalanguage the sequence is used to build an
equation, whereas in poetry the equation is used to build a sequence (71).

It's "build an equation" that is perhaps an overhasty summary of poetry's
use of metalanguage and, in fact, of poetry's relation to sound, its
would-be poeticness in Jakobson's most famous statements: "the poetic
function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection
into the axis of combination [and] equivalence is promoted to the
constitutive device of the sequence" (71).  So to back up we could
initially dispute the accuracy of the word "equation" for both poetry and
metalanguage.  Is equation (of sound, syllables, stress, etc.) in fact
poetry's primary device?  This view best describes (a) metrical and rhymed
poetry generally (b) Russian poetry specifically--and _not_ advanced
American poetry of the last 150 years.  If phonetic equations are crucial
for this later tradition, they are certainly not _the_ primary
organizational feature of Whitman, Dickinson, the Objectivists, The New
York Schoolers, The Language Writers.

I'd want to say that if we study phonetic equivalence as a device, its
effects could be centrifugal as well as centripetal.  Connections at a
semantic level made through sound can project as well as collapse.  They
thrust us out into the world as much as they swing us back toward the poem.

Now back to poetry and metalanguage: when poetry deals with metalanguage it
does not simply _build_ sequences through equations (this would be
old-fashioned narrative poetry, or a poetry of unselfconscious definition)
so much as foreground the paradigmatic components of such equations, render
them perceptible--in its critical moment--as unnecessary and even
destructive habit, and--in its utopian moment--as deformations of
linguistic habit that open spaces for thought.  This means that in a
metalinguistic poetic line or stanza several potential members of a
sequential subset coexist, and it is their coexistence that is the point.
Simple example: (a) the figure of a normative syntax that gets called to
mind through (b) its deformation.  Coexistence is the point, then, not out
of a naive desire for infinite possibility, but because it allows an
energetic charging that can emerge only through a worn, maybe suspect,
phrase or syntactic structure undergoing mutating invention.

What I want to suggest is that we can account for Jakobson's effects over
the last forty years by charting how his interest in metalanguage gets (a)
extended into poetry in ways he won't and (b) socialized in the form of
inquiries into the power relationships that connect texts to their
institutional and generic frames.  To put it sweepingly, a social
understanding of metalanguage and an acknowledgment of its relevance to
poetry mark points at which Language writers begin to follow Foucault and
not Jakobson, though of course only Jakobson could have provided this
inventive, concretely formulated linguistic point.  I'm emphatically not
saying that a poetics of metalanguage is itself "subversive" or even new.
Instead, the history I see is that poetry's relation to metalanguage first
gets posed in Jakobson, then developed somewhat generally in early Language
writing and now begins to take on new relevance as poets work out poetics
that explicitly, and often humorously, involve the mostly literary
institutional frames of the epic (Lisa Robertson), the fairy tale (Lyn
Hejinian), the picaresque novel (Hejinian and Carla Harryman), the
bildungsroman (Pamela Lu)--but also the encyclopedia and historiography
(Barrett Watten).  As I said earlier, exposure through metalanguage of the
non-neutrality of linguistic and generic norms is no news: the point is
more that the dream of neutrality that Jakobson poses--"merely about the
lexical code"--is now so distant as to allow (yet to be fully described and
theorized) tonal invention and institutional figure/grounding at the
moments when texts appear "merely" to be pointing out facts, defining their
terms.  Because all good poetry poses ontological questions about its
generic status (what is epic? etc.), the question is the kind of dialogue.
It was as an attempt to articulate the force of one type of this dialogue
that, in an article in _Poetics Journal_, I recently considered the works
of Alex Cory, Ann Simon and Pamela Lu within the institutional framework of
children's language acquisition.  So a project like Ann Simon's _A
Biography of My Vocabulary_, a poetry of meta-definition, is only the most
literal version of this metalingual question.  Three very different ones
that come immediately to mind are:

*       Lisa Robertson's occupation of epic in _Debbie: An Epic_.  She puts
it best: "With what suave domesticity Virgil strolls among the deep shelves
of the paternal library.  The metric pulse of the catalogue or calendar
charts his walk.  To narrate an origin as lapidary, as irrevocable, is only
to have chosen with a styled authority from the ranked aisles of thought.
For if Virgil has taught me anything, it's that authority is just a
rhetoric or style which has asserted the phantom permanency of a context."

*       Adam DeGraff's invention--in "Poetic Statement" (_Shark_ 1)--of a
language of authority that modulates among the disembodied voice of the
anthology editor, the classic poet ventriloquizing statements about himself
that would be structurally impossible for him to make, and the earnest,
poet-centered statement of intent.

<c>
Shortly after I completed this poem, I suffered from recurring attacks of
insanity, brought on by the feeling that my work was not appreciated at
court.
   The age of chivalry has almost passed.  I am trying to revive its spirit
by this poem, written 'to fashion a noble person in virtuous and gentle
discipline.'
   In this poem the simple worker leads the company to truth after he has
finished his plowing.  I advise people to do their work honestly instead of
going on pilgrimages.
   Posterity will decide that this poem is far overrated by my
contemporaries.  It contains too much theory and too little action.  Yet my
patriotic odes mark me as the forerunner of the nationalist movement.
<xc>

*       Lyn Hejinian's _The Traveler and the Hill and the Hill_ in which,
as each fairy tale goes bad, the spaces among its 3 part syllogistic
structure open themselves up to an investigation of the social logic that
would bind short illustrative narratives designed for children, so that
knowledge for a child might suddenly become the knowledge of a child:

<c>
There was once a parson who was so arrogant that whenever he saw anyone
driving toward him on the road he would roar from a distance, 'Off the
road!  Off the road!  Here I come!'
   He glanced at all the maidens with his fiery red eyes and cried, 're you
going to pass by without offering to help me?'
   But God's existence is doubtful and even if God does exist it hardly
matters.
<xc>

One might be tempted to say that the consideration of metalanguage within
institutional frames is less a constitutive feature of recent poetry than a
basic transhistorical poetic concern: historicisms of all types can't help
but claim a metalingual aspect, even a project, for the poets they
"contextualize."  Rather than pursue this I'll give one final example.
Here's Langston Hughes in 1949 arguing against a common syntax of
substantive/preposition that would make one's relation to coded black
locations (Harlem, Railroad tracks, South Side) a matter of essential
distance and voyeurism and thereby efface life and culture inside or across
these lines:

<c>
        Visitors to the Black Belt

        You can talk about
        _Across_ the railroad tracks-
        To me it's _here_
        On this side of the tracks.

        You can talk about
        _Up_ in Harlem-
        To me it's _here_
        In Harlem

        You can say
        Jazz on the South Side
        To me it's hell
        On the South Side:

        Kitchenettes
        With no heat
        And garbage
        In the halls

        Who're you, outsider?

        Ask me who am I.
<xc>

So one function of poetry might be the organization of metalingual
questions to create energizing displacements and reflexive commentary on
normative operations of language.  But I would of course be reluctant to
call this _the_ poetic function.  For metalanguage to be a fresh question
it can't be just about a grid of normal language that gets continually
deformed and overcharged (this myopia replays a version of the
structuralists' emphasis on phonetic equation).  This also valorizes a
poetry of non-integrated small semantic units, say a string of puns at the
level of the line-a practice which we are all familiar with by now.
Instead, there must be interpenetration of scales: from clause to genre;
from word to speaking situation, from phoneme to institutional frame.

In hopes of reviving Comprepoetica, which has been getting only a little
more than one visit a day for some time, I've decided to start regularly
using it to showcase reviews of poetry collections, and individual
poems--as well as poetics/poetry-related essays of the sort already at
my site.  I hope to have the first one up sometime in February.  So, if
you have anything you want me to consider--about ANY KIND OF POETRY,
e.mail it to me--with, please, a return address, so I can get back to
you about it.  Snail-mail submissions will be okay, too.  My intention
is have a series of weekly posts containing only posts I like (which
will depend mainly on their skill at close-reading) or my own (since I
doubt that I'll be getting submissions from too many others for a

space to do so.  I plan to have two feedback files available, too--one
for what I consider sensible & coherent responses to posted essays, and
one for the rest.  I hope also to start posting more of my own published
essays by themselves--with essays from others, published or unpublished,
if anyone will send them to me.<br><p>

In an attempt to liberate our back list, UNITED ARTISTS BOOKS is offering
all titles
at a 50% discount. (Prices listed are the original ones -- just cut them in
half.)

PERSONAL EFFECTS by Charlotte Carter. 93 pages, paperback. Cover by Angela
Fremont.
$6.00.
"Like the music her characters listen to or sing, Charlotte Carter's
writing may be lyrical or funky, or melancholic and bittersweet. She's
always wry and economical. Her touch is delicate and tough, as she explores
issues around race and sexuality, as she wittily cajoles the reader to
notice how much bitter and more complicated the picture really is." Lynne
Tillman


SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO by Dennis Moritz. 126 pages, paperback. Cover by
Pamela Lawton. $8.00.

Nine theater pieces by the Philadelphia-based playwright whose works have
been performed at Joseph Papp Public Theater, BACA Downtown, Nuyorican
Poet's Cafe and The St. Mark's Poetry Project.

"His plays are square in the face of society, which is where Dennis Moritz
is, full of humor, elbows and mesmerizing love of language." Bob Holman

LIQUID AFFAIRS by Mitch Highfill. 64 pages, paperback. Cover by Mimi
Fronczak. $7.00.

"When I read Mitch Highfill's poems my heart beats faster and my hands get
all sweaty. It's the closest I've come to weightlessness since I was an
astronaut." Todd Colby


ECHOLALIA by George Tysh. 75 pages, paperback. Cover photograph by the
author. $7.00.

"Writing at sexual pitch is my favorite ace of the impossible deals and
George Tysh takes this gamble to its most serious extremes. This book
arrives at the perfect angle of deviance." Clark Coolidge


BLUE MOSQUE by Anne Waldman. 64 pages, paperback. Cover by Louise Hamlin. $6.00.

"Anne Waldman is a poet orator, her body is an instrument for vocalization,
her voice a trembling flame rising out of a strong body, her texts the
accurate energetic fine notations of
words with spoken music latent in mindful arrangement on the page." Allen
Ginsberg


POLITICAL CONDITIONS / PHYSICAL STATE by Tom Savage. 60 pages, paperback.
Cover by George Schneemsn.

"I've been reading Tom Savage's poems for a long time and have come to
realize that I need each new book. He's a particularly honest and
tough-minded poet; his voice is one I count on to register change--social
and individual, to tell me what's going on. He's good--poet, person." Alice
Notley


LOVE UNCUT: POEMS 1986. 85 pages, paperback. Cover by Louise Hamlin. $7.00.

"Bill Kushner's streetwise joie de vivre observations charm the hardest of
macho hearts. Frank O'Hara would surely approve. These energetic "songs of
a goof" are sheer gravy heaven." Anne Waldman


ALONG THE RAILS by Elio Schneeman. 76 pages, paperback. Cover by Pamela Lawton.
$6.00.

"I like Elio Schneeman's first major collection very much. It reminds me of
the big-city angularity of Edwin Denby, the graceful weightlessness of Paul
Eluard, the childlike amazement of Joseph Ceravolo, and the mysterious
displacements of Pierre Reverdy, but what is better is that it reminds me
of Elio Schneeman." Ron Padgett


THE FAST by Hannah Weiner. 43 pages, paperback. Cover by Anne Tardos. $6.00.

"Hannah Weiner is the only clairvoyant I know, or that I've ever known. Her
achievement--& it is a considerable one--lies in her having developed a
specific literary form through which to convey her remarkable experiences."
Jackson MacLow


LOVE MAKES THINKING DARK, by Barbara Henning. 85 pages, paperback. Cover by
Miranda Maher. $7.00.

"Barbara Henning's deep and quirky knowledge of the human soul--especially
woman's soul
--brings us to a simultaneous exploration of the outside and the inside,
Self and Other: the macrocosm and microcosm of the alchemist. She takes us
far, and so skillfully that we are glad to let her do it." Diane di Prima


POEMS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY by Daniel Krakauer 86 pages, paperback. Cover by
Dave Barkin. $7.00.

"Krakauer's stye is somewhere between automatic writing and crafted satire.
What he is about is alertness and knowing. It is astonishing how
contemporary his poetry continues to be, especially those poems written
before 1960." John Godfrey


INFORMATION FROM THE SURFACE OF VENUS by Lewis Warsh. 93 pages, paperback.
Cover by Louise Hamlin. $7.00.

"Lewis Warsh's thought is not circular, but spiral, in fact--and is, in
this way, totally appropriate for the times. All propositions turn back on
themsealves, the image of truth is uncertainty; and all that we know about
a thing is limited to our knowledge of its limits. The sense that this
isn't quite fair, or right, is what gives his thought, his work, its moral
power, and humor." Fanny Howe


Also available:

JUDYISM by Jim Brodey. 86 pages. Cover by Martha Diamond. $10.00

THE CALIFORNIA PAPERS by Steve Carey. 52 pages. Cover by Peter Kanter. $8.00.

Hartigan. $7.00.

Announcing the Inaugural Volume in the New Series
Modern and Contemporary Poetics,
edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Artifice and Indeterminacy: An Anthology of New Poetics

Edited by Christopher Beach

This volume brings together the most important writings on
contemporary poetics by poets and critics who have shaped and
defined the  contemporary literary avant-garde.  Beach gathers
the strongest and most representative writings of the past two
decades and shows more clearly than ever before the depth and
breadth of contemporary American poetics. Collectively, these
essays break with conventional interpretive frameworks and
traditional generic boundaries of poetry to give fresh voice to the
poetics of our time. Neither dismissive of the aesthetic value(s)
of poetry, nor reluctant to articulate the ways in which aesthetic
evaluation is complicated by the mediating influences of history,
culture, class, gender, race, and academic status, the writers
presented in this anthology celebrate the "artifice" of the poetic
text while also accepting as a given the "indeterminacy" of its
inception and reception. Individual pieces range in style and
approach from theoretical writings to discussions of individual
poets such as Emily Dickinson, Louis Zukofsky, and Bob
Kaufman. The authors consider such critical issues as gender
and the possibilities of a "feminist poetics," the textual politics of
race and class, and the broader implications of an avant-garde
practice.

one-hour long disk presents solos and duets by these two Vancouver artists.


On January 29, 1999, Houle & Strang will be performing with two jazz groups
(Francois in a trio with bassist Chris Tatty & percussionist Dylan van der
Schyff; and guitarist Ken Aldtraff's trio with Brian Harding trombone &
drummer Nick Gaffaney) @ Performance Works, Granville Island, VANCOUVER,
B.C., 8 pm, $15/12. CDs will be available for sale at the performance.

The disk is also available by mail to Poeticsa list members for $14,
including postage or any two Periplum disks (including two copies of
Clamourous Alphabet) for $25.  Please send checks to Periplum, P O Box
95678, Seattle, WA  98145 USA.   The  Clamourous Alphabet CD will be
available in stores and through SPD for $16.95.

Other Periplum discs include:

Pauline Oliveros & Ellen Fullman. inventor of the 100-foot long  Long
String Instrument

Burning Water - Martin Bartlett; three interactive computer pieces (with
Peter Hannan, George Lewis, & Frances-Marie Uitti) & a solo by Bartlett
using homebrew & early Buchla modules

Catacombs of Yucatan - Dan Senn; compositions & improvisations for homemade
electro-acoustic instruments, with a horspiel based on oral history of a
1930s dance hall in Minnesota

Archipelago - LAND; collaborative dark ambient/improv band with Jeff
Greinke, Lesli Dalaba, Dennis Rea & others

The following is taken from the pr for the January 29th performance:

Poet Catriona Strang and clarinetist Franois Houle have been working
together for many years on collaborations that explore the complex and
sometimes antagonistic relationship between music and language; their
combinations of words and sound weave a richly bracing aural terrain. They
have performed together across North America and in England at such
festivals as the "Recovery of the Public World Festival" in honour of poet
Robin Blaser and the Tic-Toc festival of New Music. They have recorded for
the BBC, and their new CD, "The Clamourous Alphabet", is available now on
the Periplum label.

The product of many years of intense collaboration on everything from
composition to diaper changing, "The Clamourous Alphabet"  is an amorphous
work that inhabits and interrogates systems of notation, both linguistic
and musical. It is not words set to music, or music with text, but a piece
that weaves between and beyond musical and linguistic terrains, always
shifting, never predictable.

Catriona Strang is the author of Steep, Low Fancy, Familiar, and TEM, and a
scout for the poetry magazine Raddle Moon.  Her compact, textured poetry
has appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies, including The Gertrude
Stein Awards for Innovative Poetry (Sun and Moon) and Out of Anywhere:
Linguistically Innovative Writing by Women (Reality Street Editions). In
addition to working on "The Clamourous Alphabet" with Franois and caring
for their daughter Nina, she is currently writing a song cycle with
composer Jacqui Leggatt.

Franois Houle is a noted performer on the crest of new directions in the
improvisational world; familiar with the classical vocabulary as well as
the worlds of jazz and contemporary music, he pairs the intensity and
urgency of free jazz with complex compositional processes to create subtle,
innovative, and passionate music. He has collaborated on numerous projects
with some of the world's finest improvisers, including Marilyn
Crispell, Jolle Landre, Georg Graewe, Dylan van der Schyff, Peggy Lee, Tony
Wilson, Dave Douglas, Evan Parker, Myra Melford, Carlos Zingaro, Phil
Haynes, Mark Dresser, Lisle Ellis, and Paul Plimley.

kind of Allen anthology of those ginks over there, lots of them, of course
on the Buffnet. Peter Quartermain, he of incredible energy, it seems, and
Richard caddel the editors. A nice thick book from Wesleyan, who have
turned into a brain-filled publisher of late.

        Paul Metcalf died today (1-21-99).  Paul was born on the day and year of
the Russian Revolution (November 7, 1917). He was an actor, a school-bus driver,
and a real estate broker. He was the author of twenty-four books, most of them
in a genre that he invented.  His best known books are _Genoa_ (1965),
_Patagoni_ (1971), _Appalache_ (1976), and _The Middle Passage_ (1976).
Twenty-two of the books are published in the three-volume _Collected Works_

13th January 1999. Canadian Peter Jaeger helped SVP in London kick off its
winter/spring season, reading a substantial amount of recent work to a
reasonably-sized audience on a less than pleasant germ-laden London winter
evening . Your correspondent, attempting to chair, was high on the symptoms
of a heavy cold and the effects of anti-symptom substances; so his memory is
more than flawed.

However, having been asked to, I can make some observations. Firstly, of the
wide range of procedures and forms that Jaeger exhibited, and all apparently
from the same writing period - seeking to appropriately match form and
procedure to material; and also, whatever procedures were applied and forms
developed, the appropriation of linguistic material from his / our
environment and its reuse, both towards the making of the texts he uttered
and towards exposing the procedures and assumptions of that material in its
original context, and the creative clash of the two. I hope that's clear
enough - I still have the cold.

Secondly, or is it thirdly, or higher, I was impressed with his ability to
modulate tempo and tone of voice according to the demands of the texts so
that each piece had its own shape and pace and tone, while the different
registers of the combining fragments and the fragmenting registers went
flying by in their own spaces at their own pace. Clear reading, confident
reading, strong and appropriate.

I became aware of Peter's work first through his visually-oriented texts. He
didn't perform any of those on 13th, but one can't have everything. Yet, in
a way, we did, because Writers Forum launched two publications by Peter
Jaeger, both visually very exciting:
BLUE HERO ISBN 0 86162 849 7
BIBLIODOPPLER ISBN 0 86162 858 6
I look forward to hearing them performed, in person or in recording, at some
future date.
There are copies in North America, with Peter, and more are on their way. Or
else order from New River Project, 89a Petherton Road, London N5 2QT
Each booklet costs £2.00 + postage which of course varies with where you
are. Sterling only, I'm afraid.

NB SVP magazine will be publishing a batch of work by Peter Jaeger - this
was deferred from 13th Jan due to the bugs. Likely date of publication of
9th Feb, which will be SVP 1999 # 3. An announcement will be posted, List
Willing. And Peter also features in WORD SCORE UTTERANCE CHOREOGRAPHY edited
by Cobbing and Upton and also published by WF, last year
Send enquiries regarding the 3 WF books to NRP with sae / irc, not me
please...

dear Listees, subscribers, poetics personalia -

Since re-beginning distribution of the Poetics List a short
while ago, I've received a number of concerned messages, queries,
and suggestions as to the status of the list, mostly with regard
to what the new format might be. Principally, I agree with those
of you who've expressed a desire that the list might be open to
a bit more than just announcements and news; or, as a friend of
mine put it, "I don't know how much more of this I can take."

The initial restriction to the latter was in place to give me
time to catch up on (and to learn the mechanics of) the
administrative duties 'behind' the list. I appreciate everybody's
patience with this period (even everybody's impatience!). Now that
I'm somewhat more comfortable with my role as moderator/editor,
and have figured out what I =can= handle, I want to invite more
extensive participation from list subscribers.

However, we're still restricted at this point to what I can handle.
As list moderator, all of the messages come to me to be OK'd
before being passed on to the list; part of my job is to shape
the course of the list, keeping it predominantly, though with
occasional detours, to the topics for which it was set up (i.e.,
poetry and poetics); and part of my job is to keep the volume of
the list to a manageable level - say, around 15 messages per day,
including announcements (more or less on any given day, of course).
News and announcements are still considered to be a primary function
of the list.

Other sorts of posts are very welcome, and an important component
of the list. As to what other sorts of posts, I can offer some
suggestions; however I'm not necessarily going to restrict the
list to those suggestions, and I hope that what is sent will shape
the list in ways I wouldn't expect. Above all, I don't want the
list to be seized with too much formality any more than I want it
to be taken for granted; so, when for example I say "book reviews,"
what I really mean is something closer to "I just read The Auto-
biography of Groany McGee, and here's what I think" for a few
paragraphs. Most of the suggestions I'll offer here are also to
be found in the "submissions" section of the Welcome Message:

       - information on publications and reading series
       - event reports, book reviews, and short articles
       - thoughts on or statements of poetics
       - reading lists (annotated or not)
       - occasional poems (or poems, occasionally)
       - occasional political or organizing news
       - obituaries
       - responses to any of the foregoing
       - queries on poetry/poetics topics

With regard to queries, I would ask that responses be sent to
the person querying; and that this person would assemble and
send a post of edited "highlights" from responses. Please feel
free to write me a note and ask about something you plan to
send, if you are unsure as to whether it's right for the list.

I should add that there are a few things I don't want, mostly in
the interest of keeping list traffic down. These would be messages
to other subscribers, for example "thanks for posting x" or "can
you post x?" - things that can best be handled backchannel. One-
line responses expressing agreement or disagreement with a post
aren't too welcome; if you agree or disagree with someone, please
at leasttake the time to explain your position. I don't have any
particular objection to announcements of job openings or apartment
swaps, etc., so long as we're not inundated with them.

I hope this message clears up or preempts some confusion about
the list format, as well as serves invitation to participate.
I've been tuned in to this list for a long time, often with my
finger on the delete key, but often with great interest. Good
things have happened here, and I don't intend to be an obstacle
to their continuance.


       best, Chris

            Christopher W. Alexander
            poetics list moderator


p.s., Alan Sondheim has asked me to announce that the Fiction
of Philosophy list, or FOP-L, is open as a forum for discussion
of, among other things, poetry and poetics. (Officially, FOP-L
"is devoted to issues and presentations of philosophical fiction
and fictional philosophy"). Since FOP-L is a co-moderated list,
they are prepared to handle more traffic than I can at present.
To subscribe to FOP-L, send an email to <listserv@vm.cc.purdue.edu>
with the message

            subscribe FOP-L

followed by your real name. (E.g. "subscribe FOP-L Immanuel Kant.")

To in-need literary organizations/presses:

The Poetry Project has an Apple Laserwriter NT to donate.

It needs some fixing--one of the toner gears or the "face-down delivery
system" needs replacement. But otherwise, it's been a very good & loyal
printer.

If you pick it up from our office (in St. Mark's Church, 2nd Ave & 10th

This is thoroughly dismaying news. I'd say that Metcalf is (like Ronald
Johnson) one of the most severly under-read inventors of our time / language
/ thought / art / seeing.  I guess I feel more than a little guilty that I
spent so ;little time furthering his work. Oh how I wish otherwise. Damn
damn damn. And who will notice, outside this list? Hardly anyone, I'm
afeard. But yes, as Don Byrd reminds us, there are (thank what goodness
there might be) the three volumes of the collected works. We should go
(re)read them..

Dear Listees:

I'm writing an article for Salon Magazine on graduate students and
masturbation, basically exploring a casual theory about the strong
relationship between grad studies and self pleasuring.

I've gathered many touching comments thus far.  I'm interested in reaching
out to as many informants as possible.  I'd use first names only.  I'm
looking for people who are currently grad students, are recently finished
grad school or are now profs.

If you are willing to answer a few interesting questions in whatever manner
you desire, please backchannel a message to me and let me know, and I will
email questions to you.

Thanks in advance, Betsy Andrews

Hi -

I'm writing to suggest that there are two excellent lists for presentation
and discussion of poetry, since Poetics will remain by and large a modera-
ted list for announcements. Both lists have a number of Poetics subscrib-
ers already.

Fiction-of-philosophy is an unmoderated e-mail list for writing - most of
which is poetry or poetics. There is some discussion as well. We are
inviting all of you to sub to it; it will remain unmoderated and open to
any literatures. To sub, write to listserv@vm.cc.purdue.edu and say in the
body of the email,

subscribe fop-l <firstname> <lastname>

That's all (fill in the names without the carets).

There is also available: SUBSUBPOETICS
an e-mail discussion list for news, games, and conversation about poetry

Point yourself to http://subsubpoetics.listbot.com

or if you can't have java and cookies send a note to jdavis@panix.com

Thank you!

Subject:      Valuable Info for Self-Publishers Plus an Announcement
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The valuable info for self-publishers is that you can get short-run
editions of self-published books, chaps, zines, anything (perfect-
bound in 4-color laminated covers) very reasonably at an "on-demand"
publisher I've found in Atlanta.  The cost isn't super-low but the
great thing is that the initial cost can be as low as $40 or so.
Sprout is the name of the company (and this is an unsolicited plug
from a satisfied customer--I have no financial interest in the
company, nor do I know anyone involved with it except commercially).

Here's how it works: you send them $25 plus 25 cents for each page of
your manuscript (for scanning) plus a camera-ready copy of your
manuscript.  They then print however many copies you want, even just
one.  You pay an additional one to three dollars for each copy of
your book depending on its size and cover price.  I had 10 copies of
the third, revised edition of my Of Manywhere-at-Once (210 pages)
printed for what would have been $100 (except I got a special-offer
discount of $50).  That's not cheap, but from now on I can get copies
of the book for $3 apiece.  The big plus is that I didn't
have to come up with $500 or more to get my book published.  And I
didn't have to make room in my house for a minimum of 100 copies.
Ashley Gordon, the person I worked with via e.mail, was very patient
and helpful, too.  Go to http://www.sproutinfo.com for more
information.
As for my announcement, I've already made it, pretty much.  My Of
Manywhere-at-Once is now available from the Runaway Spoon Press,
3621 for $10, ppd.  It's part memoir, part discussion of what poetry is
that covers pretty much the whole spectrum from Shakespeare through
Keat, Cummings, Steven, Yeats, Pound, and Roethke to contemporaries like
Karl Kempton, G. Huth, Liz Was, John M. Bennett . . .  The terminology
is updated and made other revisions here and there.  The information in
it, mostly about visual poetry, is now nearly ten-years-old, but it's
more than you'll find on its esoteric
subjects than you'll find in any other book I know of.  (It doesn't
have a 4-color laminated cover, though--I don't like the way they curl.)

I just returned to poetics list a couple of days ago. this is the first I
have heard. I had the pleasure of publishing Golden Delicious and Firebird
by Paul, and of visiting him a couple of times in Massachusetts and hosting
him, in Wisconsin in the early 80's, and twice later, in Tucson, where he
read, we performed a play of his, and more. Paul will be missed. blessings
to all his friends, and particularly to Nancy.

I'm working on a dissertation at NYU covering the history of reading
series in the Lower East Side during the 1960's.  I need to get in touch
with Sam Abrams (his role in organizing early events at the Poetry
Project) and Andrei Codrescu (his role in a fake "assassination" of
Kenneth Koch and a drug-bust release fundraiser held for him at the Poetry
Project in 1968).  If either of those poets are on this list, or if anyone
feels o.k. about sending me phone #'s / e-mails for these fellows, I'd
appreciate it ever so much.

                              ANNOUNCEMENT:


    SOME OF THE NEBULOUS AWARDS MIGHT BE COMING YOUR WAY, IF NOT OURS!



I think my friends Ryan Whyte and Tom Zummer and myself are possibly going
to give the First Annual Nebulous Awards sometime this year or the next,
if not earlier. These Awards are given to some of those people who might
deserve it for things they probably have done sometime within the recent
past, although to be honest, it might be within a more distant past, also
probably if not earlier. There is almost no discrimination in regard to
class, race, gender, religion, sexual preferance, or age, or other things.
We're not sure which direction the discrimination might have taken, in
regard to the group of people we're possibly considering for starting the
cycle of Annual Awards, beginning with the First, although we might hold
out long enough for the Second or a bit later, if not much later. It
depends on who's running, who's counting, who's interested, if not
interesting. We decided to offer these rewards because there's a lack, we
think, of certainty in regard to these or other rewards, in various
categories. We might have further announcements about this, so try and
stay tuned; the whole thing could be rather exciting, if not altogether
exciting.

Please contact one or all of us sometime!

I attended only one poetry class during my college career.  It was pretty
horrible and, being the brash undergraduate that I was , one afternoon took
the prof. aside and asked him if he even liked poetry.  He said, "No."  "Why
then teach it?" I responded.
"It's a job."

Robert Creeley's new book, DAY BOOK OF A VIRTUAL POET, is a moving example of
how lively and compassionate the profession of poetry can be. DAY BOOK is the
record of Creeley's participation in an on-line poetry course for students at
City Honors in Buffalo, NY.  I recommend it as antidote to the sort of
disinterested teaching of poetry that many of us have grown up with.

Well, the real trouble is that I can't figure out if an award of this kind
is the sort of thing one ought to avoid or ought to lust for, but then what
does that ought mean. I mean, I think, that maybe there's no need for a duty
or even a desire to be attached to either the receipt or the donation, and
there might possibly be a slight doubt as to what an award of this sort
might be for, motivationally thinking or socially if you get what I think I
think Imean, and does any of us out there which might be here know or even
have an inkling what an award is anyway and would any of us want to know
why? (who's us, by the way?)

But yeah, if getting it -- one of it I mean -- is a good (?) thing, then
would I like one; but otherwise perhaps, well gee, what do YOU think, hunh?
But I'm not sure I want you (or anyone) to tell me. Even if I don't / do get
one. (What IS it, to "get" one?)

Sounds, hmmm, thrilling. Is more possible to be told?

Holbrook Teter, a book-maker and friend of poets whom I first met through Ed
Dorn many moons ago (Nixon was president), died suddenly of a heart attack
the other day. He also did a ton of community organizing in his day, a great
combination of impulses for a life.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

News from the west coast...

Around the first of January, I started noticing something new on some
billboards here in L.A. Instead of the usual ads, there were short
(really short) excerpts from poems -- not even excerpts, really, but one,
two or four lines removed from their original context and left to hold
their own alongside the Marlboro man and whatever. The first one I saw
was from Emily Dickinson, then I saw one from Charles Bukowski, and I
thought, what the hell is this? Then the L.A. Times ran a story on it ("A
Turn for the Verse," Jan. 13, page E1), saying that there were a total of
60 billboards, with carefully clipped quotes from T.S. Eliot, Helene
Johnson, Pablo Neruda, Wallace Stevens and Mark Strand...along with
Dickinson and Bukowski (it's like one of those old Steve Allen "Meeting
of the Minds" shows). The boards are being paid for by an anonymous
group, "Poets Anonymous," and they've hired a major publicist, Susan
Martin, "a poetry lover herself" (who showed up for the Times interview
in a Lone Ranger mask "to dramatize the spirit of anonymity").

The idea behind the whole thing, according to Martin, is to provide "a
kind of instant window for reflection," and to raise awareness of poetry.
The sponsors did a lot of legwork, she says. "They did all the research
to make sure the billboards covered every part of the city and bought the
space. It was a huge, huge task."

NPR also did a report on this, and it's on their web site
(http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/archives/1999/990119.me.html).
They figure that it probably cost $10,000 per billboard. I did the
math...it's $600,000.

Maybe I'm just too damn paranoid, but I think something really strange is
going on here. 600K is a lot of money, and, according to the publicist,
the group is not a non profit or a foundation. So it's got to be a
business, right? And it's got to be a big business. Because they didn't
just get the billboards, they got an expensive PR person to go with them.

Anyway, one more thing. Today I found an article from the San Francisco
Chronicle (http://www.sfgate.com) about how a poet named Martin Espada
was offered $2,500 by Nike to use one of his poems in a TV commercial.
Nike is sponsoring something called the Nike Poetry Slam -- to along with
a series of four commercials about women athletes for the Winter Olympics
(?) (!). Espada said no (on the basis on Nike's wretched labor policies,
etc.) and wrote a letter to Nike (also published in the January issue of
the Progressive). Needless to say, a lot of other people wrote poems and
got the money.

Now, I don't know if Nike is behind these L.A. billboards (tho it could
be). But it does seem that corporations are starting to see that there's
money to be made in being associated with poetry (even anonymously). So
my question is, is this what it's like not to be marginalized?

The second residency in our new "Life/Forms" series is with San Francisco's
own Myung Mi Kim, the widely acclaimed poet, editor and teacher. In her
creative thought, she has examined through social and political exigency
the process of inducing inner-and outer-chaos to achieve a higher level of
equilibrium. This rigorously calibrated poetry, so polyglot in execution,
fairly drips with life, anxiety and multiple voices, and carves an opening
towards a new kind of human community. Myung Mi Kim's books of poems are
Dura (Sun & Moon, 1998), The Bounty (Chax Press, 1996), and Under Flag
(Kelsey St., 1991). The winner of numerous awards, she is Associate
Professor of Creative Writing at San Francisco State University.

*** Man starting Christian tattoo group

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - Randy Mastre is a tattoo artist of Christian
themes. He inks Jesus into his customers. His tattooed Biblical
inscriptions and portraits of Christ provide startling contrast to
more typical flaming skulls and "Born to Raise Hell" markings
adorning the leather-clad bikers he rubs elbows with at national
tattoo conventions. It was at one of those convention that he met the
Rev. Daniel Ostrowski, a born-again Christian and Word of Faith
pastor who runs a tattoo parlor in Wassau, Wis. Last year, the two
decided to unite other Christian tattooers. Since then, almost 100
tattoo parlors across the nation have heard the call of the Christian
Tattoo Association. See

This ought to appeal to readers of Neal Stephenson's _Snow Crash_:
Elvis songs to be recorded -- in ancient Sumerian
January 21, 1999
Web posted at: 12:34 PM EST (1734 GMT)
HELSINKI, Finland (Reuters) -- A Finnish academic known for recording Elvis
Presley songs in Latin is planning a new record of eternal hits-- this time
in the ancient Sumerian language.
Jukka Ammondt told Reuters on Thursday he intends to bring out a Sumerian
single in the next few months and an album in the autumn.
He has been practising with "Blue Suede Shoes"-- translated into the
cuneiform language of Babylonia that died out around 2000 BC.
"Elvis would have liked the idea because the ancient Sumerians had big
parties and drums and rattles, and the roots of rock may go back to man's
earliest efforts to get a grip on life," said Ammondt, who has produced two
records of Elvis songs in Latin.

The Koerner Lecture Series: Art, Politics, & History
Michael Turner, Nettie Wild, and Duncan McNaughton
Sponsored by The Capilano Review and the Capilano College Foundation

This spring The Capilano Review presents its first annual Koerner
Lecture
Series on Art, Politics, and History. Vancouver poet Michael Turner
(Hard
Core Logo, American Whiskey Bar), Vancouver documentary filmmaker Nettie
Wild (A Place Called Chiapas), and San Francisco poet Duncan McNaughton
(Valparaiso, another set / of circumstance.) will present selections
from
their work, and will discuss the impact of art and history on that work
and
on the formation
of contemporary culture in a highly politicized world.

Friday, February 19, 8:00 pm  <The Tyranny of Genre, or Why Listen to
Peter
Gzowski When You Can Talk About Contemporary Writing?> In this lecture
Michael Turner will address issues of genre, modernism, experimentation,
recent trends in Can Lit in relation to "our" international profile, and
will explain "how Peter Gzowski has ruined writing in this country." He
will also relate these issues to selections from his own work, from the
documentary poems of Company Town (Arsenal Pulp Press) to his
forthcoming
book, The Pornographer's Poem (Doubleday Canada). Michael Turner is the
author of four books, including the novel-in-verse Hard Core Logo, which
was made into an award-winning motion picture. American Whiskey Bar,
Turner's latest book, was recently made into a short film by City TV.

Sunday, March 7, 1:00 pm   <Outside Eyes: Art, Politics, Contradictions>
In
this lecture Nettie Wild will show selections from her recent
documentary,
A Place Called Chiapas , and will discuss the relationships she sees
between the politics of Mexico and Canada. She will also speak about
"the
role an artist plays in relation to political movements where the stakes
are high." Wild's other award-winning films include A Rustling of
Leaves:
Inside the Philippine Revolution (1989) and Blockade (1993). She is
travelling North America and Europe to attend screenings of A Place
Called
Chiapas, which was also broadcast as a two hour prime time special on
CBC
TV this last fall.

Friday, March 19, 8:00 pm  <another set / of circumstance.: Poetry &
Historical Geography>  In this lecture Duncan McNaughton will discuss
the
relationship between poetry, history, and geography, arguing there is no
history without geography, and that poetry
as a form is central to contemporary thought. He will read from and
speak
to the work in his most recent book, another set / of circumstance.
(hawkhaven). He has published over eleven volumes
of poetry, including the wrapped church (Blue Millennium/AIOU), Kicking
the
Feather (First Intensity), and Valparaiso (Listening Chamber).

Admission is $5 adults, $3 students, and free for members of The
Capilano
Press Society, the publisher of The Capilano Review.  Advance passes for
all three lectures in the series are available for $12 by calling
984-1712
or 904-9362, or they can be bought at the door.  Proceeds go to The
Capilano Review Endowment Fund. Support for the series has been
graciously
provided by The Leon & Thea Koerner Foundation, The Capilano College
Foundation, and the Humanities Division of Capilano College.
The Capilano Review has been publishing innovative poetry, fiction,
drama,
and work in visual media for over 25 years.  It has received several
National Magazine Awards, Western Magazine Awards, and has been included
in
The Journey Prize Anthology.

Non coastal news...

Martin Espada's book _City of Coughing & dead radiators_ or _Rebellion_
give many reasons as to why it would make no sense for Nike to solicit
him for a poem. Another person I know was offered the same gig &
declined. Unlike Marteen (I can't use the stress mark, so...) he does
look good playing basketball, face probably will sell shoes, & only has
one similarity: (merely coincidence? I doubt it) being a minority.

So Chris, is this what it's like not to be marginalized?

The marginalization comes in when a poet is chosen as spokesperson
because they fit a particular stereotype the media wishes to uphold. The
media says: We need an angry latino male. What non-LA poet was dolled up
to fit the image of a Rodney King race rioter? How were all those early
90's MTV poets chosen? We need a timid white guy whose ass can sell
jeans. How else is there to explain why self published poet
extraordinaire Hank Rollins who covered "Just do it" by the Pink Fairies
hasn't done a commercial for Nike?

Be well

ZOKETSU NORMAN FISCHER - a short bio

Zoketsu Norman Fischer is a poet and Zen Buddhist priest who is currently
serving as Co-Abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center.  A man of wide-ranging
interests, his Zen teaching is known for its eclecticism, openness, warmth,
and common sense, and for his willingness to let go of everything,
including Zen.  He was ordained a Zen priest at Zen Center in 1980, and
completed Dharma Transmission there in 1988.  He was installed as an Abbot
of Zen Center in 1996.

Norman has been particularly interested in the application of Zen to issues
of Western culture and everyday life in the world.  He's taught
extensively, with his old friend Rabbi Alan Lew, on the relationship
between Buddhist and Jewish practice (work which has been discussed in
Judith Linzer's book, "Dharma and Torah"); he teaches Buddhist precepts to
business people, Buddhist compassion-in-action to school teachers, and
poetry writing and appreciation to children and adults.  He's led workshops
at Esalen Institute in California and the Open Center in New York City, as
well as at Zen Center, and teaches Zen regularly in Canada and Mexico.  He
has been for many years board chair of the Zen Hospice Project, and has
taught extensively on the relation of Buddhism to death and the dying
process.  In recent years he's participated with His Holiness the Dalai
Lama in conferences on Buddhist Christian dialog and non-violence.


MAURICE GROSSMAN, ARTIST -- a short bio

Professor Emeritus of Art, University of Arizona
Award winning artist/teacher
Educated at Wayne State University, Ohio State University and Alfred
University
Fulbright Scholar to Japan

Fifty years producing and exhibiting clay art
Work in many national and international collections
Major contributor to the Arizona Art scene since 1955

"My current work is part of a continuing adventure into vessel making.  The
ceremonial objects of many cultures have been of interest to me throughout
my art career.  The containers that people are buried in, the ritual
vessels we appease the Gods with or the reliquaries we store holy objects
in, these all have a certain magic about them that I enjoy."

or to be more specific, _Women Editing Modernism : 'Little' Magazines &
Literary History_ :

can anyone provide contact information for Jayne E. Marek, the author of
the above-mentioned book?

It is, by the way, a great book, especially the chapter on Marianne Moore
& The Dial, "The Ironic 'Editorial We'" which resituates Moore's own
'self-effacement'/absorption into the editorial collaboration (such as it
was or wasn't is discussed thoroughly) as it arises out of her sense of
institutional/personal/self - respect rather than as a result of a
self-marginalizing lack of self confidence.

Which is not to say "it all depends on how you look at it" but a lot
depends on how _long_ you look at it and at what point you are willing to
dismiss 'the rest' as 'inconsequential' to the annals of literary history.
(Raymond Williams' notion of a 'selective tradition')

thanks & a warm hello to the list

Nicholas Johnson has asked me to post this revised version of an earlier
posting.

           FOR THE LOCKER & THE STEERER

     a two day event at Diorama Arts, 34 Osnaburgh Street, London, NW1,
     featuring artists whose poetry & performance negotiates the territory of
     location, site & the body.

Sunday 14th March 2.30 pm

David Gascoyne.

       (First London reading since 1990.  The great British surrealist of
        the 1930s, who enjoyed a tremendous revival of attention during the
1960s
        and has now become Britain's most loved elder statesperson of poetry.)

Sunday 14th March 7.30 pm

Aaron Williamson & Craig Athill.

     (Astill plays the deaf drum (bodhran) creating a sound which vibrates
through
      an especially constructed stage, animating the balletic voice-body
      performance of Williamson, who is deaf.)

Bob Cobbing.

    (The celebrated sound/concrete poet/bookmaker, who has influenced
     generations of other poets across the world.)

Nicholas Johnson

    (performing The Lard Book, a gargantuan Visual Book in a silver case, a
found
     text utilising a multitude of voices: neologism, German, concrete.  "The
     performance encompasses determinacy of chance & will solder into a short
     collaborative debut of 'Hassell' (writers forum, 1999) with Bob
Cobbing.")

Monday 15th March 7.30 pm

Helen Macdonald

     (whose debut collection Safety Catch drew widespread acclaim on both
sides
      of the Atlantic.  She works with falcons and hawks -- poems full of bird
flight
      but mysteriously and musically so.)

Iain Sinclair

    (poet, 'intellectual best-seller' prose writer and film maker of renown
and cult
     followings.  His work in progress is a sequel to the 12 walks that became
     Lights Out for the Territory, and his poetry also acts as a reading of
the city of
     London, "locations of the immediate and the unexpected".)

Douglas Oliver

   ("a rare London reading for this poet-explorer", says the flier, plus some,
but
     excuse me, I'm off to do some exploring.)

Subject:      Steiner, Venuti, Polish Baroque verse
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

I'm looking for listmembers interested in literary translation.

In terms of theory, I'd be very interested to exchange opinions on
George Steiner's AFTER BABEL, Lawrence Venuti's THE TRANSLATOR'S
INVISIBILITY, Willis Barnstone's THE POETICS OF TRANSLATION.

And one corner of the field: archaizing translation, taken as a response
to links between the poets and literary traditions of source- and
target-languages. As an example: a sixteenth-century Polish poet,
Mikolaj Sep-Szarzynski (meekowhy semp shajinski), who has a good deal in
common with English proto-baroque religious poetry - Fulk Greville,
among others. Both of these poets thrive on spiritual conflict, without
indulging in intellectual paradox (as does Donne). The idea is that a
poet like Greville would make little sense in contemporary English and
that, in fact, his impact is inseparable from his language, style, form,
etc. As Sep-Szarzynski expresses many of the same associations and
cultural currents, the English of the one seems to me to make for an
appropriate vehicle for translating the Polish of the other. On the
basis of these kinds of parallels, I have translated a number of Sep's
sonnets (as well as other early Polish poetry) into what some will no
doubt call pastiche, but which I hope conveys a more organic sense of
the period whose writings provide its linguistic bearings. I know that a
proper explanation of this method would require a good deal more
specific information and argument; for the moment, I am only curious to
know if there are others on the list who either have already done some
thinking about these matters or would like to begin thinking about them.

Thanks for your attention.

Jamie Harmon Ferguson



Here, then, is the sonnet, followed by my translation.

SONET V

O NIETRWALEJ MILOSCI RZECZY SWIATA TEGO

I nie milowac ciezko, i milowac
Nedzna pociecha, gdy zadza zwiedzione
Mysli cukruja nazbyt rzeczy one,
Które i mienic, i musza sie psowac.

Komu tak bedzie dostatkiem smakowac
Zloto, sceptr, slawa, rozkosz, i stworzone
Piekne oblicze, by tym nasycone
I mógl miec serce, i trwóg sie warowac.

Milosc jest wlasny bieg bycia naszego:
Ale z zywiolów utworzone cialo
To chwalac, co zna poczatku równego,
Zawodzi dusze, której wszystko malo,

Gdy ciebie, wiecznej i prawej pieknosci,
Samej nie widzi, celu swej milosci.



SONNET V

OF THE UNCONSTANT LOVE FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD

And not to love is hard, and for to love
Meagre solace when thoughts astray in lust
Sweeten to excess those things which must
And change their hues, and still t'ward ruin move.

Who so well will it suffice to taste
Of gold, the sceptre, fame, delight, and beauty's
Created face, e'en that he might in these
Have sated heart, and 'gainst his dread resist?

Love is the very course of this our life:
And yet the flesh, of elementals wrought,
Praising what knows beginning like itself,
Forsaketh sprite, that findeth all but nought,

When Thee, ever during truest fair,
Thyself it seeth not, object of its care.

the same student, an architect, who last quarter was interested in poetry
or literary texts having to with metallurgy, is now interested in a
bibliography on the poetics of alchemy.  i know there are many links
between alchemy and poetry, but i don't know any basic helpful texts, or
poetry that is the result of alchemical experiment (other than, perhaps,
gerrit lansing's).  could ye out there e me some suggestions to pass on to
him?  thanks
