A couple years ago, there was a thread here re: finding Cage's Music of
Changes as played by David Tudor.  Happily, HatART (I think the HatNOW Art
imprint, or some such) has just released a 1956 recording.  I've seen it at
Other Music <http://www.othermusic.com> and Kim's in NYC, where I bought it.
It's great.

Hi, all. I'm moving to Boston in a month to join my partner and teach
English at colleges, but I'm hoping to also do some Teachers & Writers
style teaching in the public schools.  Does anyone know who I might
contact about this?  Are their organizations?  I have never done it
before, but have both workshop-leading and teaching-children experience.
Do I go through an organization?  Contact schools directly?

Any info would be most appreciated.  I'm also hoping to freelance write or
copyedit -- if anyone needs/knows of needs for that in the Boston area,
that'd be great too.  Actually, all Boston info wanted: I know the basics,
but would love advice on favorite independent stores, places to go
running, Buddhist sanghas, organizations that need volunteers (literacy or
Green Party-type), favorite places to eat, etc. We will most likely be
living in Dedham, just south of Jamaica Plain, and will invite anyone who
offers good advice over for tea when we get settled!

Backchannel, please.  Thanks so much.

Arielle

    Geoffrey Gatza lives in Buffalo NY with his two cats, Blaise & Claries.
His work is set in consumer iconographic texts that is instantly
recognizable in its settings of classical & religious poetry. The narrative
is plain to any red-blooded American worthy of their suspenders, or at least
the parody will not escape the blackest of holes. To quote Bart Simpson,
"The ironing is delicious."
   Gatza continues, "To only see this  work from the printed page is to see
it as the cereal box top graphics I try to emulate. A computer screen or
newspapers, perhaps allows for the soft, almost a muting of lines, which the
printed medium often negates. This takes a decidedly different stance from
Enzio Feregara who's poetry is plainly absurd."

President Bush recently announced that the United States Government
will not honour its commitments under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to reduce
greenhouse gases. The United States produce 25% of the world's carbon
dioxide, a gas that is believed to be the main contributor to global
warming.

Rising global temperatures are known to raise sea levels, and
change precipitation and other climate conditions. Changing climates
alter forests, crop yields, and water supplies. It could also threaten
human health, and harm birds, fish, and many types of ecosystems. An
increase in weather-related disasters will occur, deserts may expand into
existing range lands, densely populated coastal areas will flood and large
numbers of people will have to move.

Show you disagree with the Bush Administration's decision to withdraw
from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Global Warming. Urge President Bush to
review his policy in this matter and devise a comprehensive plan to reduce
US emissions of so-called greenhouse gases.

Sign your name, town and country of residence at the bottom of this
e-mail, copy the entire text of this e-mail (do NOT use the forward

If you see 100 people have signed this message before you, send this
e-mail to the White House at president@whitehouse.gov to show Mr. Bush the
world is watching. Then start a fresh copy of this message with your name
as the first signer.Thank you.

Subject:      Police Prepare for May Day Mayhem
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

April 30, 2001

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Action is being taken in Britain and Germany to
counteract May Day mayhem that is threatening to erupt in their capital
cities on Tuesday.

Police in London are mounting a massive security operation involving 6,000
officers in an attempt to avert a repeat of rioting that rocked the city
last year.

And in Berlin, a court has upheld a ban on a planned May Day demonstration
by far-left militants protesting under the slogan "Fight capitalism --
Social revolution worldwide."

Berlin's upper administrative court said the ban was justified because the
organisers of the march had done nothing to prevent a repeat of violence
that has accompanied the event in the past.

Police, fearing clashes despite the ban, have called out 9,000 officers and
announced special protection for government buildings including the chancellery.

However, a march organised by the far-right National Democratic Party has
been given permission to go ahead.

In London more that 10,000 anti-capitalist demonstrators are expected to
take part in a May Day protest which last year turned violent.

Barricades have been erected round Parliament Square where workmen boarded
up statues of Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln.

Britons were outraged last year when Churchill's statue was daubed with
graffiti and a piece of green turf was slapped on his head in a
Mohican-style haircut.

Prime Minister Tony Blair promised his full support for police who warned
they would adopt a "zero tolerance" approach to protesters if rioting erupts
on Tuesday.

Blair said: "I want to express our absolute and total backing for the police
in dealing with anyone who seeks to bring fear and violence to our streets."

He told the London Press Club: "The limits of tolerance are passed when
protesters, in the name of some spurious cause, seek to inflict fear,
terror, violence and criminal damage on our people and property.

"It is not idealism, It is idiocy. It is not protest, it is crime pure and
simple."

Anarchists, drawing on the experience of anti-capitalist protesters in
Prague, Seattle and Quebec, have recommended that protesters wear
military-style protective gear and scrawl their lawyers' telephone number on
their arms.

Assistant Police Commissioner Michael Todd said: "We will be highly visible
on the streets of London and anyone committing a crime will be held to
account. I am absolutely clear about that."

Lord Harris, chairman of London's Metropolitan Police Authority, had warned
police might use rubber bullets for the first time on the British mainland
if rioters ran amok.

But that avenue was firmly closed by London Police Chief John Stevens who
said: "Such ammunition has never been deployed on mainland Britain and I
have no intention to do so tomorrow."

The anarchists accused the police of over-reacting. Mark, a spokesman for
the Reclaim The Streets group, said protesters will not get fair treatment.

"No doubt they are going to feel scared and intimidated," he told BBC Radio.
"The only antagonism there is likely to be is from the police."

In Berlin, Eckart Werthebach, the city council member in charge of law
enforcement, promised that any violence will be met with "the full force of
the law."

"We have had street terror for the last 14 years in Berlin on May 1,
approaching civil war proportions," Werthebach told Westdeutscher Rundfunk
radio. "I believe that should no longer be permitted."

PROVERBS OF HELL


Bring out number, weight and measure in a year of dearth.  Bring out more
numbers, some original action scripts, and a few scanned photos of some
found images in a year of not having many good ideas for poems.

Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead.  Drive your
program through a cartload of images, and you may chance upon the gold
filling of a retired army general in your "ox tail" soup.  Drive your viewer
through too many random assortments of texts, and ye shall find a reader
with a bad hair life.

The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.  The road of greater
flexibility leads to the simplicity of the book.  The road of suggestive
variability is the road to beauty; the road of arbitrary variability is the
road to boredom.  Give the user what she seeks, in curious doses, and ye
shall taste the wine of attention.  A little bit of "fort da" never hurt
anyone.

Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.  A
cyberpoem that is merely a milk fed, commodified unacted desire will kill
the infant in its cradle before it has learned how to read.

The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.

Prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.  But more users
have visited Prudence's web page than Exhibitionist's because capacity has
become the mantra of corporate culture.  It is the Artist that can make
abundance out of Incapacity, and it is the Artist who will not be burned by
dot com meltdown.

The cut worm forgives the plow.  The cut internet connection is
unforgivable, but is always a possibility.  Go in fear of exact timing in a
web project, since time/timing depends on CPU speed and the capacity of the
viewer to take it all in at a fairly regular rate of attention.

The most sublime act is to set another before you.  The most sublime
cyberpoem is an electronic object with the plasticity of a solid object.  An
electronic object should be an ordered arrangement of surfaces and angles,
just like a Vorticist sculpture.

Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the
night.  The virtual body is always idle; the living body is always at play.
There is more data in the body of a brainless corpuscle than there is in
your philosophy, Horatio.

Eternity is in love with the productions of time.  The productions of our
time are able to be dated by model and serial number, and version of the
application or language.

Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth.  An everything
that is possibly an image of truth is also the truth.  Web imagery is more
powerful and linguistic when it approaches the powers of the icon, or the
emblem; what is merely "eye candy" jams the transmission of syntactic
meaning.  A good if uninterpretable icon is worth more than a thousand
words.  What one thinks one has said and what another thinks one has said
are both of equal importance.

Shame is Pride's cloke.  Shit is Pride's cake.

Dip him in the river who loves water.  Find the well of electronic water,
and dip him in. The well is called scandal, and the chemical equation: those
you know, squared.  Web space must be a Rabelasian space or it will not be
at all.  Dip him in the streaming well of living (not "virtual")
subjectivities, and ye shall have a better informed viewer of the
MacNeil/Lehrer news hour.

What is now proved was once only imagin'd.  But to prove a theorem with a
piece of art proves nothing.  The good cyberpoem is like a bad mailman; the
magazine never arrives if the subscription has already been paid for.  But
letters from far-away sailors and stewardesses intended for the person next
door are always on time.  A cyberpoem should never prove a theory; it should
prove several theories simultaneously, such as the theories of love, hate,
boredom, attention and  distraction.

He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star.  Randomized text
has never been as enjoyable as randomized sound. To be a star, use what
words have which neither sound nor image have: suggestive meanings that are
nearly as powerful, or moreso, than the obvious meanings.  To lie is not to
deceive; to tell the truth is not entirely reasonable when the truth is for
sale, even if this truth is randomized.

All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap.  To overload a web
project with trickery scares the wholesome away, back to the sandboxes and
safe havens of childhood.

Prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion.  The
truly Rabelasian web-project is built with the objects of previous
programming ventures, previous engagements with Adobe Photoshop, previous
attempts at writing stand-alone cross-platform lyric poems.  Neither law nor
religion, this non-prison is built with the bricks of radical democracy.

The nakedness of woman is the work of God.  There are lots of naked women on
the internet.  The cyberpoem that does not satisfy the need for taboo vision
can stay at home and watch the grass grow.

Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps.  Excess of vision is bound to
cross over into territories that mom and dad will write to the school
principle about.  The good cyberpoem is like a nutritional toxin; let them
have their cake and hate it too.

The fox condemns the trap, not himself.  Don't be afraid to use Flash
because it is slick; there is nothing primitive and back-to-earth about a
Pentium I chip.

The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.  The rest of the lion is pretty
good, too.  The best web art will be carnivalesque, dialogic, Rabelaisian.
There is no reason to be a moralist, and even less to be anti-authoritarian,
when multiple subjectivities are possible in a single electronic object.

The cistern contains: the fountain overflows. The book is beautiful to the
degree that it fools you with the sense of the totality of its system.  The
cyberpoem is beautiful to the degree that it convinces you of the
contingency of its system, though it freely inflict its system on you.

The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.

The weak in courage is strong in cunning.  The prospect of a web avatar does
not satisfy the failures in one's life as an artist.  Abuse not the powers
thine anonymity grants thee, lest thine anonymity become permanent.

The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the
tyger, the horse, the elephant watch the fruits.  The cyberpoet is the
mouse, the fox, the rabbit; the viewer is the lion, the tyger, the horse.
The cyberpoet starts by desiring the creation of the perfect soybean meat
substitute, and ends by creating the perfect meat.

A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.  So paint a different
tree for the wise man, a different tree for the fool.  The art of the
electronic object is expanded tenfold when the same electronic object can be
approached three different ways and yet provide a completely different
experience. Enter the car from the left side, and you are the driver; enter
it from, the right, and you are a passenger.

The busy bee has no time for sorrow.  But the internet poet should have time
for others.  The internet poem that doesn't "stare back" the more it is
stared at is not a very good text, not a very good application, and not very
polite.

The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands and feet
Proportion.  To create a cyberpoem with the ethical complexity of the body,
with the machine age planned-obsolescence of an Asimov robot mated with the
fleshy, warm substance of Blake's innocent Babe is the highest goal a
cyberpoet can achieve.  The working parts of the body are the working parts
of language when it is in dialogue with itself and other language objects on
the web.  One must be a language-object to be in dialogue with a language
object.

One thought fills immensity.  One well conceived cyberpoem, as simple as a
bobsled, can be linked to from a thousand sites, a thousand eyes.  Server
space does not equal head space.  One poorly constructed thought, like one
poorly constructed cyberpoem, can destroy a lifetime of good programming.

Exuberance is Beauty.  But so is a narrow waist.  Waste not thine electronic
filing system and thine low-bandwidth on high-res Photoshop images when a
well-tempered interface will do fine.

The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow.
The page-based who was not first an eagle should be wary of learning of the
ways of the web, which is the way of the scavenging crow becoming an
avenging eagle.  A cyberpoem need not start with text, but with the pleasure
of creating a text, not with the pleasure of programming, which is the
pleasure of death.

Though I don't have the exact facts to hand I do believe that XLibris no
longer provides a free service. If I remember aright the minimum charge is
$200 and that provides no typesetting so poetry has to be in the higher
price brackets (they specifically tell you so on their site)
Which is the best place to go re the precise facts.

And by of mention of Henry Gould a lot of people I know over here in England
are saying very nice things about his volume 'Stubborn Grew'. A one to
read's the word.

The Academy of American Poets beauty contest for a sheet of poetry stamps
supposedly is now over (tho the database program on the web site still looks
active to me). There appears to have been a concerted effort by the neocons
to get two of their own (Robert Penn Warren and Mark Van Doren) onto the
list and they did make the top ten. But so did WCW, O'Hara and Stein. Over
200 poets received votes.

Also noteworthy was the fact that HD and Anne Sexton apparently stalled some
weeks back and fell back pretty dramatically -- they had been in the top ten
for the first six weeks or so. I'm also intrigued at the high number of
votes given to Eli Siegel -- a strange late modernist who later became the
head of a cult that "cured" homosexuals. Hot afternoons have been in
Montana, indeed.

Hi Michael,

  you're right to say that professors of poetics et al
are often better-off, financially and professionally,
than others interested in poetry. It is for precisely
this reason that they have a responsibility to stand
up to attacks on the education system and public
cultural resources (sorry, that's a very awkward way
of putting it). With their relative autonomy and their
research resources, tenured professors have an almost
unique opportunity, in contemporary society, to expose
the blindspots of the status quo. I suppose the
classic example of an academic who has done this is
Noam Chomsky, but there are  others.

Recently a professor at a university in Kansas did his
job when he condemned the 'police killing machine'
that prompted the recent uprising in the city of
Cincinnati, and noted that the cops responsible needed
to be brought to justice, by any means necessary. The
mass media and the corporate sponsors of the
university have been up in arms, but he will be able
to keep his job and keep speaking out. It's excellent
to see the academics in Hawaii using whatever
advantages their jobs give them to make similarly
necessary statements.

I'm not arguing that the political work I've just
described is the same thing as poetry; nor am I
arguing that it should be obligatory for those who
would write poetry. But it may just be that an
engagement with the 'heavy stuff' of politics and
history is today the stimuli that might push poetry
forward, into new and challenging territory. (Wasn't
what the Beats were doing underlaid by a critique of
the type of society tht still exists in the US today?)
The 'great black mass' of postmodernism which you
describe is surely not the result of an engagement
which the grand old themes, but the symbol of a
retreat from them, into the muddlement of empiricism
and the comfort of the coterie. Interesting to note,
in this light, that a number of postmodernist icons
(Baudrillard, Lyotard...) began their journeys to the
centre of the alphabet by making critiques of Marxism
and other katascopic creeds.

Cheers
Scott

I've recently published an anthology of 19th c. Carroll County, Maryland
newspaper poets titled The Hidden Muse.
This book includes an introduction, notes, and biographical information on
the poets, as well as a checklist of all poems published in the Carroll
County rural papers  from 1833 to 1872.  It's available from all on-line
bookstores.  I've turned up some interesting information on Emma Alice
Browne, a Victorian writer who lived in Westminster, Maryland right after
the Civil War.  This writer has recently been rediscovered by Professor A.
Petrino, who discusses Browne's excellent poem "Measuring the Baby" in her
book Emily Dickinson and Her Contemporaries; Women's Verse in America
(University Press of New England, 1998.)  The Hidden Muse presents more work
by Browne, as well as new biographical information.

In addition, in compiling this anthology I stumbled across a handful of
poems by the American dark Romantic P.M. Deshong--a fine writer who simply
disappeared in 1848.

The Hidden Muse includes an appreciation of Charlotte Bronte written in
1860, a Civil War satire on " rebels" who sought doctors' notes to avoid
enlisting, a temperance poem from the 1850's worthy of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
poets and other interesting items.

Cost: $11.95.  ISBN: 0-595-15609-6.  It's a handsome book at 142
pages--perfect bound with three-color cover.  I'm happy to answer any and
all questions concerning the book.  Back-channel Jesse Glass

legacy and theory


at 58 i begin to wonder: what legacy will i leave behind?
i will have created multitudes
i will have given life to jennifer and julu, to nikuko and travis,
 to alan and clara and honey
i will have explored the farthest reaches of virtual and real spaces
 returning with indescribable arts and literatures
i will have added to the substance and nature of theory itself,
 coming to grips with the smoothings of plasmatic languages,
 with new languages and new ways of modeling the world
i will have added texts and images, words and pictures, sounds and
 cinemas, to the future of humanity, to those who would disentangle me,
 those who would comprehend, those who take time and energy
 to unlock the new emergent, unfettered by the past,
 as if language could be understood without regard
 to inherited meanings and customs, as if the dawn had no night,
 the night no day
i will have left memories of the future anterior, my face subtle and
 drawn, against the visage of the new and enormous sky
i will have had the experience of multitudes, will have come
 to delineate, ever so slightly, the imaginary evanescence
 that is ours, at this hour of the dusk, this hour of the new
 millennium
i will have succeeded in my failures, failed in my successes,
 passed this on to you, this new vision and energy of culture,
 this new circuit and element
i will have come to you, taken from you, communed across these vast
 distances, of time, of space, of virtual generators and generations
this is my legacy, this is what i leave behind
this is my legacy, this is what i bring forward from the future

About 3rdBed:

3rd bed is a journal publishing innovative work by known, unknown, and
forgotten writers=8Bwriters who move beyond the front lawn of domestic
realism. We are looking for fiction, for poetry, and for work that blurs th=
e
distinction between these genres; we are looking for translations of author=
s
living and dead; we are looking for a range of pieces that evoke anything
from disquiet to whimsy, from the jarring to the soothing: work that may be
variously urgent, kaleidoscopic, infantile, or elliptical.

THE ART OF LISTENING: POEMS AND CRITICISM
A WORKSHOP TAUGHT BY GARY LENHART
[See bio for May 9th reading.] Public service announcement, short cut to
publication, pedantic gloss, frantic jumping up and down for
attention-criticism can be all these things, and boring too. How does one
make it something closer to heart, less declamatory, and more responsive?

This week and next week at the Poetry Project:

Wednesday, May 2nd at 8 pm
ELENI SIKELIANOS AND TONY TOWLE
Eleni Sikelianos is the author of several poetry books and chapbooks.
Earliest Worlds (Coffee House Press, 2001) is her first major collection.
Writes Alice Notley of Earliest Worlds, "An original and beautiful poetry,
always discovering its own grammar and name, its own secrets. The poetry
comes from her and not others: it is incomparable." Tony Towle's most recent
book is The History of the Invitation: New & Selected Poems 1963-2000
(Hanging Loose Press, 2001). His work displays "elegance of style, lush
imagery, lofty diction, transparent use of metaphor, and numerous devices of
wit and rhetoric," writes Charles North. Mr. Towle was the editor of The
Poetry Project Newsletter from 1987-1990.

Wednesday, May 9th at 8 pm
DIANE DI PRIMA AND GARY LENHART
Diane di Prima will be reading from her just-published memoir, Recollections
of My Life as a Woman (Viking). Ms. di Prima is considered by many to be the
most important woman writer of the Beat movement. She settled in Greenwich
Village in the early 1950s, where she lived for many years. During this time
she co-founded the New York Poets Theatre and founded the Poets Press, which
published the work of many new writers of the period. In the early 1960s,
together with Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), she edited the literary newsletter
The Floating Bear. Her books include: Poems for Freddie (1966), Earthsong
Poems 1957 - 1959 (1968), The Book of Hours (1970), and Pieces of a Song
(1990). "An amazing creative force, Diane was and remains a major talent and
an inspiration," writes Peter Coyote.
Gary Lenhart is the author of several collections of poems including Father
and Son Night (1999) and Light Heart (1991), both from Hanging Loose Press.
He edited The Teachers & Writers Guide to William Carlos Williams (Teachers
& Writers, 1998) and Clinch: Selected Poems of Michael Scholnick (Coffee
House Press, 1998). "Tender heart, nimble wit, and tough mind radiate
throughout Gary Lenhart's poems...poems that are so well made that their
craftsmanship is invisible-the ultimate graciousness of art," writes Ron
Padgett.

I know some of you are interested in what happened in Buffalo a week =
ago at
the E-Poetry conference.  I haven't read any real summaries, but John =
Cayley
posted the following on the E-poetry chat list that runs through a lot =
of
it, and I had a fairly lengthy response to it, which follows.  Some of =
this
might seem a little technical or just insider talk, but it's easy to =
hum
along...  if anything else comes down the pipe I'll try to post it.

>=20
apologies for crossposting=20

briefest ? of remarks offered as a personal attempt to outline what I
consider particularly significant about this important and truly =
delightful
festival.=20

first again high paise and deep gratitude to Loss Peque=F1o Glazier =
without
whom. Note that proper-paradoxically, by single-tracking a huge =
confluence
of live datastreams he achieved a miracle of Lossless compression,
distinctly in contrast to more the more Lossy codecs of most =
conferences,
including the subsequent DAC (digital arts and culture) conference the
following weekend in Brown University (more on that later). Anyway .... =


history: at last, in the field of what I call literal art in networked =
and
programmable media (phew: henceforth NPM, but there is as yet no easier =
way
to say it), we are beginning to see the wider emergence of historically
grounded contexts informing what have hitherto -- all too often -- had =
the
character of detached, naive-autonomous essays in the so-called new. =
The
presence of Philippe Bootz representing the configuration of poets and
programmers around *aLire*, the earliest all-electronic publication =
devoted
to writing in NPM (1989-) was crucial.  *aLire* has a tradition, =
related to
but distinct from the ALAMO (computer assisted offshoot of the OuLiPo, =
most
prominent practitioner perhaps, Jean-Pierre Balpe). And I suspect this =
group
is also the earliest to have a developed sense and theory of 'poesie =
anim=E9e'
which now plays as Concrete-inflected webbed-up textual Flash movies. =
And
although there are many others of us throughout the world working in =
Flash
(or Director or Flash-like things), doing so with a background in, =
amongst
others, Concrete, Dada, Constructivist graphics, Lettrism, etc. etc. =
(Flash
animators who have read and practiced some part of what Johanna =
Drucker's
read and practiced) we still don't have a history of animated text =
written
by a poet or critic of poetry. (Or do we? Please let me know.) This =
would
discover -- beyond the flipbook -- cinematic titling and =
proto-cinematic
titling as the originator of the mode and would trace it into and =
relate it
to animated text in advertising. The only book I've used on this is =
(the
impossibly over-designed so as to be almost unreadable) Bellantoni and
Woolman *Type in Motion: Innovations in Digital Graphics* London: =
Thames and
Hudson, 1999. (Saul Bass!!; Pablo Ferro); but maybe -- in a 'Digital
Culture' context -- Lev Manovich's *The Language of New Media* (MIT =
Press,
just out and I've just bought it) will have something to say on this or
provide leads .... Generally, we still have a long and necessary way to =
go
in relating our practice to media history. So on to ...=20

practice: here, for me, the most exciting development which I believe =
we are
currently witnessing is the transition to writing in NPM which is
practitioner-led rather than formal-experimenter or =
media-experimenter-led.
The already-poets and already-writers have tooled up and developed a =
sense
of what they can do, what they desire to do, what they do not desire to =
do.
Of course this actually began to happen some time ago, but efforts in =
this
direction have been -- perhaps with the exception of Kenny Goldsmith =
and
cohort's invaluable ubuweb (eUbu for the contemporary genuinely NPM =
stuff?)
which has been visible since its inception -- somewhat obscured by =
eFluff.
Brian Stefan's 'The Dream Life of Letters' (performed at the conference =
and
much-appreciated) is on ubuweb -- a tour de force; even a little =
depressing,
since its going to be hard to think of 2D text-and-graphic figures =
which
Brian hasn't done. Perhaps that's the point. We begin to stop trying to
think of new things to do and start trying to sort out which of the =
figures
might be regularly useful for our own practices and projects. (Maybe =
Brian
could suggest some that he particularly likes and maybe even give them
names?)=20

I probably should have sited the strong Brazilian contingent at ePoetry
before Brian since they are likely to be his 'anticipatory plagiarists' =
(I'm
not being rude, its an jocund OuLiPian term -- look it up; you'll have =
fun
doing so). Great stuff from Wilton Azevedo, who also read for the late
Philadelpho Menezes, and from Lucio Agra. Hot tip of an iceberg which =
seems
to me also to be better contextualized than animated poetry in the
English-speaking world.=20

Separate practice thread: I was also encouraged to see and hear that =
there
is new engagement with what I refer to as programmatological work; =
writing
in which the programmability of the writing media is a necessity. =
Amongst
the poets, and outside the chance-fearing OuLiPo, there are programmers =
who
can distinguish trivial manipulations of language from investigative =
and
generative procedures which address its structure and the abyss. Neil
Hennessey and Jabber; Darren Wershler-Henry & Bill Kennedy and their
apostrohe engine; Glazier's early-in-the-way Jonathan Minton; Glazier
himself. But all of them (Glazier except since he's written the =
history) are
somewhat decontextualize and we are still far from having these =
facilities
built into our word processors (whereas graphic and sound artists do =
have
the equivalent filters and modulators built into their tools).=20

In his *Open Letter* article 'Reflections on Cyberpoetry' (Number 9, =
Fall
2000, pp. 22-33), Brian Stefans opens with a quotation from Roger =
Pellet:
"The greatest cyberpoem would be an online application that provided =
you
with an interesting text and a robust interface with which to =
manipulate it.
In other words, a word-processor." Well yes, we can see where this is =
going
and the requisite perspective which it lends to the discussion, but MS =
Word
has never provided me with an interesting text or a robust interface =
(cf.
BBEdit) or any interesting tools to manipulate whatever text *I've* =
provided
for it (or plagiarized by anticipation). Maybe Photoshop or Flash are a
vizPo cyberpoems?=20

Under this thread, its also necessary to mention one of the best =
critcal
contributions to the conference, by Katherine Parrish, who provided
excellent materials for and analysis of precisely the history and
contextualization of writing in NPM, while heading for the further
textonomic quadrant of live collaborative writing (mixed with
programmatological intervention by e.g. MooLiBots) in MOOSpace.=20

Inevitably, I dwell on practices which, while not the same, are closely
related to certain of my own, but I also have to signal quite distinct
threads in ....=20

social literal art and literal art as gaming and (later I'll come to)
literal art as playable/performable instruments: ... not only because =
they
are, like, 'happening'. In gaming, in intercourse, 'rule modification =
is
inherently social' (based on the speaker's remarks during a paper by =
Jesper
Juul at the later DAC conference). This is one of those brilliant but
obvious statements which has important consequences, for any notion of =
the
avant-garde for one thing. It's hard to make a playable, configurable
avant-garde game or social intertext because the avant-gardist tends to
change the rules without telling anyone, or only telling 'his'
(invidiously/historically) friends, or with the intention of concealing =
the
rule changes (so that they are more disruptive?!?) or in the hope that =
later
(after-the-avant) critics will work out the clever changes that 'he'
(invidiously/historically) has made so that said avant-gardist gets to
retire to Olympus or the Academy. This is, perhaps, a good personal
strategy, but in this media it ain't going nowhere, since, it seems, in
practice, many aspects of the media are inherently social. For me, this
raises the happy prospect of no-compromise poetics which play out in =
the
social and therefore escape the seductions of avant-garde elistism. =
Ububoys
beware. You are great forces, and the Torontonians amongst you also =
come
from an important contextualized and localized tradtion, but you've got =
to
go opensource and join the f***ing community. On the other hand, I'm =
going
to resist and exclude myself also for as long as possible, but others =
out
there: M&M And & Damon; Alan Sondheim; the Albany configuration (which =
might
perhaps check out audience-response protocals when high art keeps =
calling
after time); but especially the general sense that work is nearly =
always
being made *in collaboration*. Reiner Strasser's turnaround times seem =
to be
particularly impressive and productive.=20

net/web art connections: Another major Brazilian contribution came from
Giselle Beiguelman, linking from the practices I've already mentioned, =
this
work was - with that of Alan Sondheim - also 'our' chief connection to =
the
world of 'net art' or 'web art'. These practices are widespread but =
hard
(for me anyway) to characterize or pin down, except to observe that =
they
seem to ally more with visual and performance art than with literal or
literary art. Nonetheless, they are often text-based, but in a manner =
which
is strangely willfully? autonomous from traditions (including =
avant-garde
traditions) of poetic practice. We definitely need more cross-over =
here, and
Giselle was our link at this festival. Follow it.=20

performance: (Excuse errors please. I'm racing to scribble this and get =
it
off before having to go back to my saltmine.) Finally a word on =
performance.
We will not be able to get away from the issue of performance in this =
type
of work. Off the page, the time-based aspects of literal art are more
difficult to bracket in both actual performance and actual criticism. =
Text
as space; as an instantiation of a spatial engagement with language =
(even as
time passes) is one thing (and perhaps an inalienable aspect of the
literal), but as consumed or performed, literal objects in networked =
and
prorgammable media move and morph and translate and transliterate and
interrelate and change in time. As such, practice and theory =
necessarily
extend beyond 'configuration for the sake of interpretation' =
(art-making) to
'interpretation for the sake of configuration' (gaming). These =
formulation
are based on an excellent paper at the later DAC conference by Markku
Eskelinen on the theory of games (in the context of literal art). We =
are
used to understanding that there are (literal) art objects and that =
there
are also games and social/intertextual spaces which may have literary
qualitities, but we now also need to develop a 'vocabulary' of a range =
of
transitional objects which display and modulated time-based media and =
which,
perhaps, are more like (musical) instruments: they may have an art =
built-in
and are interpretable as such, but this interpretation is done so that =
they
can be configured or 'played'. For some practitioners the playing, the
playing-well will be the goal of engagement with such objects. For =
these
people the instrumental practice becomes more like a game. For others =
the
playing, the configuration will be done for the sake of achieving an
interpretable moment or series of moments. The play or configuration =
will
resolve a time-based performance to a literal object of critical
interpretation.=20

(That last bit was written really quickly. Sorry.) Anyways, there are =
many
other dear performers at Loss's festival which I have not mentioned, =
but
please, you-all, don't take this wrongly. I have only been trying to =
set out
super-quick the tendencies and themes which I personally believe are
important for us to recognize and engage ....)=20

.... and I share in this sense of missing you all, since despite this
everwhere we seem to find ourselves in email networks (chiefly), you =
are not
here when I am ... =20

REALLY, really classy, Claire!  Totally prize-winning, totally tomorrow.  The avant-garde meets high
fashion.

I'm going to make it my midsummer goal to get my derangements up to snuff enough to throw my assemblages at
the Cauldron threshold and beg conscription into your jet set.  I hope Tina Brown doesn't snatch you up
first.

Reminds me of the days of Barbara Bloom and "Men in Cities."   Brava!  Brava!  Ah the long-awaited
Synthesists...!

Dear Christopher Alexander,

I am the website manager at the Council of Literary Magazines and
Presses. Someone had a query about a poetry magazine founded by
Russell Banks at UNC-Chapel Hill, called Lillabulero Press. I thought
that members of your list would know where to get copies.

Do you mind passing along this email to the list to see if they can
help this person out?

Thanks very much.

In solidarity,
Julie

Dunn on confident students:


"I love the student," he remarks, "who comes in and says, 'I don't really
think I'm very good.' I almost take that student immediately." More
difficult are the applicants to his classes who say, "I'm really good, and I
know you'll like this."

He pauses. "They're always really god-awful. . . ."



So, jeez, if you're really self-deprecating and apologist and insecure,
you'll make a fine student.  But if you're confident, nay, iconoclastic,
then you are obviously not worthy.  Which means to me that he's too much
insecure to handle a confident student.

I am reminded of the song, "We don't need another hero" sung by Tina Turner.

I surely don't want him to expose me to the "right poems."

And if his comments about language poetry were not silly enough, here's an
edifying caption to the photo of the author: "Stephen Dunn's first writing
job was penning the praises of Nabisco products."

there you have it, folks.

This guy wins awards writing poems like the following:


Because We Are Not Taken Seriously

Some night I wish they'd knock,
on my door, the government men,
looking for the poem of simple truths
recited and whispered among the people.
And when all I give them is silence
and my children are exiled
to the mountains, my wife forced
to renounce me in public,
I'll be the American poet
whose loneliness, finally, is relevant,
whose slightest movement
ripples cross-country.

And when the revolution frees me,
its leaders wanting me to become
"Poet of the Revolution," I'll refuse
and keep a list of their terrible reprisals
and all the dark things I love
which they will abolish.
With the ghost of Mandelstam
on one shoulder, Lorca on the other,
I'll write the next poem, the one
that will ask only to be believed
once it's in the air, singing.



I'm plainly embarrassed for the guy, I mean, the American poet with Lorca
and Mandelstam on his shoulders like Duracell batteries.  I guess I just
knocked them off.    Just as long as he doesn't call himself a New Jersey
poet.  Then I'll really be insulted.

where, towards the end, you will find the following:

His work falls outside two controversial camps in today's poetry: "New
Formalism" and "Language Poetry."

"New Formalism," he says, "arises out of an interesting complaint that free
verse has gotten slack and sloppy. I would agree with that. My way of
remedying it would be to write free verse that is not slack and sloppy,
rather than to return to meter."

Language poetry, he comments, "is a wholly different thing." Its often
"indecipherable" quality annoys him.

"It turns its back on the world of meaning and value," he asserts, conceding
some exceptions. "Finally one word is as good as another word. It absolutely
eliminates the possibility of serious criticism - you can't say anything
because it's more committed to the flow of language on a page than to
linking language with meaning.

"Because it's a poetry of mind that eschews emotion," he continues, "you
have to have a very good mind to do it." Dunn dislikes language poetry's
refusal to "commit itself to things," and its belief in "the indeterminacy
of language."

"Of course," he adds genially of language poets, "they would say that I'm
bourgeois and conservative."

The results of the poet-on-a-stamp contest suggests
something pretty dismal to me: that it is true that
just about nobody gives a damn about poetry.  9511
votes from what: 5000 voters at most (since one voter
could vote more than once)?  Sure, a lot of poetry-
lovers no doubt thought the contest too silly to
participate in, but still . . .

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

Poetry Center Book Award reading
COLE SWENSEN & ELIZABETH ROBINSON

Thursday afternoon May 3
4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

COLE SWENSEN's new book of poetry, Try (University of Iowa, 1999), was
selected for the annual Poetry Center Book Award.  The award judge cited
"Simone Weil's insistence that true attentiveness has the power of the
miraculous. . . .  The power of this work is, indeed, that it moves from
image to word, viewer and viewed, then onward, to a seam, the embodying
point of contact, a 'something mysterious that exceeds accounting.'"  Also
a noted translator from the French, Ms. Swenson has had book-length
translations published of works by Olivier Cadiot, Pierre Alferi, and Jean
=46remon.  A native of northern California--and alumnus of SFSU--Cole Swense=
n
lives in Colorado, where she directs the writing program at the University
of Denver.

Poet ELIZABETH ROBINSON was judge for the Award this past year.  Her own
latest book, House Made of Silver, is brand new from Kelsey St. Press., and
Under the Silky Roof is forthcoming from Burning Deck.  After years spent
studying and teaching on the East Coast (New York and Providence), in the
Midwest (Chicago), and Southwest (Oklahoma), Ms. Robinson now lives in
Berkeley, where she earned her Doctor of Divinity degree at the Graduate
Theological Union.

Small Press Traffic Presents
two events this week:

Thursday, May 10, 2001 at 7:30 pm

Barrett Watten

Barrett Watten has made several rabble-rousing appearances at Small Press
Traffic, from way back when during the famous "Poetry Wars" and the
publication of his great book Progress. It's hard to believe (because he's
still a young whippersnapper) but he's been doing this for 35 years: like
a busy
clerk at the grocery store, prowling miles of aisles marking down 1/2
price those eternal vigilance price tags on every container of freedom he
finds. Ever
alert to changes in our cultural and political moment, no one else
possesses the particular attentiveness and delicacy of hearing evident in
his numerous
pronouncements. Join us as he reads from The Grand Piano, a collaborative
acount of poetics and community in San Francisco in the 1970s.

Marcella Durand & Rodrigo Toscano

Marcella Durand is well known back east as the James Dean of poetry: "Some
of the most fun moments I've had is while twisting syntax up," she
confesses. "I like driving down that road of a sentence and turning away
at the last minute -- playing chicken with nouns and verbs." She's also
been called
Whitmanesque. Durand is the author of Lapsus Linguae and City of Ports
(both, Situations Press); her Western Capital Rhapsodies will appear soon
from Faux Press. Durand co-edited Venice (the invisible city) (Erato
Press), a collection of art and poetry inspired by Italo Calvino. Formerly
of the Poetry
Project in NYC, she started the fabulous Tiny Press Center; her history of
women publishers at the PP appeared in Outlet # 4/5. Currently, she is
co-editing the franco-american web site, doublechange.com, as well as an
anthology of contemporary French poetry.


We're happy to welcome former San Franciscan and current New Yorker
Rodrigo Toscano back for this reading. Originally from San Diego, Toscano's
books include The Disparities and Partisans. His work has appeared in
journals such as New American Writing, Chain, West Coast Line, Poetics
Journal, The Washington Review, Zyzzyva, Big Allis, Tripwire,
Object/Torque and Mirage #4/Period[ical]. He is currently at work on a new
book
commissioned by Atelos Press. Toscano is always worth listening to, for he
must spend fifteen hours a day thinking and working about the plight of the
underclass in a big man's world of delusions and torture. "Who inspects
what?/ I'm a doormat talking as if I'm a kingpin./ There's my world down
there."

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

i had recently contacted the folks a
iuniverse.com - a division of Time-Warner - about
poetry submissions - something not even mentioned
on their website

in response i was told that they would publish
nothing under 108 pages - somewhat longer than
the standard volume of poetry

it seems that much of our "digital revolution" is
biz as usual - then again, we were all supposed
to be living in domed cities at some point,
weren't we?

perhaps there is need for a specifically poet's
run publish-on-demand service - where anyone
might publish but a jury of established poets
would determine a certain number of books to
"push" - welcome to the lit. ghetto all

if anyone has had any experience w/ publish on
demand please let me know - is it really a
revolution in publishing, or simply vanity
publishing in a new package?

...I am a real poet. My poem
is finished and I haven't mentioned
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call
it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES.

Hi Brian,

If by "real" summaries, you meant to exclude Alan Sondheim's recent post to
this List regarding the eConference, then I must take exception. Alan's
"summary" was as enjoyable to me as John's was informative. I find them both
equally "real" and valuable. If you missed Alan's post, I recommend it.
Thanks.

Hope memory serves me well,
but I deleted that latest Anti-Dunn post by I think Patrick Herron---

Was just thinking, I love the PASSIONATE anger
that pulitzer winner has engendered in you---

have you thought about writing an "answer poem" (or even parody, though
not necessarily) of Dunn's piece you quote? I think it would be great--
I mean take his "plain speaking" style and provide a positive alterantive

to his politics or meaning or smugness---

------------------------------------------

Few of us are full-time end-rhymers anymore in this free versified,
post-Frost climate (thank heavens!) [God, can you believe how crusty
this guy starts sounding?], . . . although I sometimes tend to use
internal rhyme abutting one rhyming word immediately against the next
mid-line. [How even cares what an unknown nobody like you does?]

Nonetheless, I believe I recall having rhymed "orange" with "syringe."

(The New Formalist quibble would be whether multisyllabic rhymes have
also to be metrically identical, trochee for trochee here.)

Or maybe it was "sarong."

Incidentally, gang, here's one I've never figured out:

Why hasn't Language Poetry/post-Language Poetry ever moved into the same
metricizing/prosodic mechanics as the New Formalists, and simply
challenged/subverted them on their own ground by simply doing better (or
as well) but with purely non-discursive/asyntactical Language Poetry
nonlinearities?

The shell of the ("traditional") prosodic structure may be inherently
neutral and, as an empty vessel, equally --- if not more --- malleable
to an asyntactical "content."

announces a new book series on
Contemporary North American Poetry

General Editors:
Lynn Keller, University of Wisconsin-Madison
Alan Golding, University of Louisville
Adalaide Morris, University of Iowa

This new series will document, analyze, and seek to sustain the many =
exciting and diverse developments in North American poetry since the 1950s =
by publishing critical studies of recent poetry, collections of essays on =
poetics, biographies of individual poets or groups of poets, as well as =
correspondence and memoirs.  The Wisconsin Series on Contemporary North =
American Poetry aims to represent a variety of contemporary aesthetics and =
to illuminate ongoing debates about the material forms and contexts of =
recent poetry.  As part of its project, the series will commission from =
leading scholars new guides to significant poets or poetry movements.  We =
also welcome recommendations for the reprinting of important books of =
criticism, poetry, and poetics that are currently unavailable.

Your Confession Is A Sandwich (But Is the Meal Real?)



you watch disappointment silently unfold.

some days you want to quit.  stand up, walk off.

the feeling goes away and comes back, the

black figure drawn on the tent-skin above

your sleep in the woods.  does it follow you?





you watch your fortunes unfurl with a flap.

some days you want to shout.  sit down, assume the throne.

your feeling justifies your permanence, you are

warm light coursing through the palm roof

as you nap alongside coral heads.  will this feeling remain?

have you never left home?  you see the mullet flap in the beak

of a pelican flapping above this briefly broken turquoise slab:

this is water & your grasp is strength over the surface of this ocean.

It is your own pool, god willing, in a memory that is yours to own.

as it never was. you are flint in love with the rain.




are you lost?  rem twitch sees bones roll between teeth

of a backhoe mouth chewing a swimming pool in

your childhood neighborhood.  soon the bottom of

your own pool. this, a memory not your own.

same as it ever. you are a puddle wishing to be stone.

EveryMan™



I am a man at one with the cosmos.

Ten dollars, they'll do my fingers 'n' toes.



I am like some god formed of the universe

And I seem to have misplaced my purse.



I see the world in the shape of this hill

And am unable to pay the bill.



                                                            Still.



                                                       Gets worse.

Lost in the Woods
for Chris Strofolino[sic]



Hunt here.   Want there.   Of surety I fain speak.

Ill tree, be dust.  Wald, be 'would', and 'could,' be damned!

Send ye breech clip to rust, fare ye barrel to creak.

Wad yr. poisons lie doon with the dead of the land.

Stuck Poets (And)

"Things explain each other, not themselves." - George Oppen


When the swarm of feeling grows it collects to drop intellect like a

   barometer in a hurricane.

When the colony of intellect grows it collects to stop feeling like a

   barometer frozen, inoperable.

Insects in cold weather.  Mixed metaphor, poetic feast and famine. Its only

   separation in re: resolution

Is no solution or every solution, or one absolution over and over again like

breath itself, but then who needs words if we need not speak when respiring?

Stranded on the tundra, the poet seems an aphid abandoned to ice, motionless

Sorry to butt in - yet, who is this Dunn character? Does he "deserve" the
Pulitzer? What criteria ar applied? Are competitions redundant yet we are
drawn to them: fascinated by the possibility of "winning"? Maybe you have to
accept that sometimes writers of a style you (or we) dont "agree with" is a
pulitzer prize winner, and deservedly so? The good and the bad? Who judges,
and who judges the judges? And on and on....
 Taking the movie comparison, I wasnt impressed with Russell Crowe in
"Gladiator". In fact wasnt much impressed by the movie. Bit supicioned that
its better not to have prizes...
   But then there is the money side.....Regards, Richard

Jeffrey. The New Formalists writing in metre and rhyme are a pathetic lot.
Who wants to be bound by a lot of quite arbitrary rules? I would and will
write in any way I want  (until one is shot for such an attitude). Certainly
its important to have some understanding of metre and the history and
certain grammatical subtleties: but if a form is "required" it will be
found. Obviously its not really possible to be "formless". The NFs have
taken one set of arbitrary forms and now they "worship" those forms. Even
apart from the stuff going on in and on cyberspace: there's room for a vast
range of invention and originality and complexity (or "simplicity" if you
want it)...one of the things the Langpos have "bequeathed" and continue to
practise is the "right" to write. The right to write and write. This write
thus then becomes much more than a rite. The reader is challenged. The
writers are challenged. Language is challenged. Shakespeare and all those
old guys get turned on their heads. People start thinking about things
instead of  being sucked into a morass of mush. If challenging poetry is
difficult and interesting but unpopular then so much the better.
  The New Formalists are wasting everyone's time.  Let's attack them: satire
and sarcasm: that's what we need...the ghost of Swift...
  Death to New Formalism! Richard.

for what it's worth, a friend of mine here in berlin,
who founded her own publishing house two years ago
(morpheo verlag, berlin) has been using print-on-demand.
her third title is a book of poetry, and it's 110 pages long.
as far as i can make out, the main problem posed by
print-on-demand is the quality of the books. she shopped
around a while before find the digital printing service she
now uses.

of course, this is not the same as poets publishing
themselves using a POD service. but it does considerably
lower the threshhold, as you can order relatively small
amounts of copies, so that in principle, it would be possible
to publish oneself. what a POD service offers is the sales
networks and logistics backup. there's a books on demand
service here provided by libri of hamburg which offers such a
service (www.bod.com - very similar to the XLibris service,
except that the parent company is a major book trader and not
a publisher in its own roght) but when it comes down to it,
the author is still basically responsible for plugging the book
through the usual channels - i.e. doing all the promotion work
the publisher normally does, whereas i guess (although i admit
i don't know for sure) that vanity publishers do actively sell
those books somehow ...

hope some of the above hope is of some use.

oh, and one other thing:
am i missing something here,
or is this poem actually by frank o'hara?

I used a publish-on-demand outfit called Sprout for three books.
They were excellent, and probably under-charging.  Alas, they
got involved with Borders, then shut down their POB operation.
Now they act as some sort of middle man for a much more expensive
POB company that is a vanity press.

Since then, I been on the look-out for a replacement for Sprout
but found all of them, including Ex Libris (if that's the right
name)and Trafford, to be vanity presses.  The best charge reasonable
set-up fees, but their per book charge afterwards is outrageous, even
leaving out shipping charges.  I have possible good news, though:
a company called On-Demand technologies.  They are not quite
POB since you have to order some minumum number of books each time
they output--but it's only 50 or so, I think.  They recently
sent me a smaple of a poetry book they did, glossy cover, good
paper stock, perfect-bound.  Looked quite good to me.

They have a URL which I can't find but a serch should get it.
Their snail address is 2220 Tomlynn Street, Richmond VA 23230.

Good luck, and let the list know what you find.  I expect to
use On-Demand as soon as I have a little extra money.  When
I do, I'll report on the result.

I've always thought combining formalism and langpo could
result in interesting verse but doing formal verse
better than the formalis using non-discursive/asyntactical
poetry would be impossible since the challenge (and a
requirement) of formal poetry is to impose meter and
maybe rhyme on "proper" syntax.  Metrical langpo would
be too easy since you could put the words in any order
to get your meter right. You could even make up words
to get rhymes.

Because the prosody of langpo is as important as any
"non-discursive/asyntactical" component.

In fact, though, there is a lot of work that could be read in just this
light. The use of reiteration in Ketjak and Tjanting in my own work can
certainly be understood (as it was by me when I wrote it) as rhyme.
Quindecagon is a complex form using the same 15 syllables to complete lines
in 15 consecutive stanzas, etc. You can find complex syllabics at play in
the poetry of Barrett Watten, and work as diverse as Bob Grenier's and Lee
Ann Brown's and Bernadette Mayer's can certainly be read as a new formalism
in the most literal sense. Or think of Charles Bernstein's limerics,
militantly metrical.

The reality is that such work has existed for decades, but for reasons of
politics (not poetry) is seldom acknowledged as such, save by the very few
open minded new formalists (Annie Finch being perhaps the best case example
of somebody comfortable with both tendencies of writing).

Xexoxial Editions (& before that Xerox Sutra Editions) has been using
the print on demand model since 1979, both to publish some of my own
works & to publish about 150 titles by more that 40 author/artists from
us, canada, germany, italy, portugal, france... A master is created &
editions are made in runs of 10-50...  when those sell more are made
based on orders & demand... no such thing as going out of print tho in
the early years we were very much at the mercy of copier technology
(back then doing 2-sided printing & card stock were quite
problematic)...  with the new round of printer/copiers anyone with a
computer & a copy of quark can create paperless masters that will print
out how ever many copies you need at the push of a button, it couldnt be
easier.  In fact these masters/archives could also be housed on the web
as opensource pdf files & people could print & bind their own, thus
encouraging a one-of-a-kind bookmaker aesthetic to enlarge upon the act
of reading & collecting {.}

Hi all you Buffalos and new-poetry listees (to whom this is cross-posted)
I wanted to say something about Jeffrey Jullich's last post to the Buffalo
List, part of the "Dunn gets Pulitzer" thread which has evolved into
something different, specifically this idea:

The shell of the ("traditional") prosodic structure may be inherently
neutral and, as an empty vessel, equally --- if not more --- malleable
to an asyntactical "content."

And richard's response:

"Jeffrey. The New Formalists writing in metre and rhyme are a pathetic
lot.
Who wants to be bound by a lot of quite arbitrary rules?"

I'm not particularly sympathetic to New Formalism (surprised?) but I have
become interested lately in rhyme.  Below is an excerpt from a
conversation I published between my brother (painter living in Brooklyn)
and I for the new "Poets & Painters" series at the Writers House in
Philly.  We were talking about appropriating elements of traditional form
(say, very photorealistic figure drawing, or descriptive writing which was
unironized on the local level - - tho ironized by whatever it abridged
perhaps) and I brought up the issue of rhyme.  With apologies for any
formatting problems (I've pasted this in and you know how that can be)
here's what I said:


[MIKE: Another way to consider this - - which involves not employing the
styles of one's hip immediate predecessors but older more outmoded forms
which the hip immediate predecessors deemed off limits - - is with Rhyme.
As I mentioned the Language Poets (hip immediate predecessors who I've
learned a lot from) were pretty antagonistic towards rhyme, with good
reason: for one thing there was that sense, amazingly still around in the
mainstream / big press world of poetry that rhyme was, if not always
desirable, than at least difficult to do and thus a measure of Talent.
For another, there was/is a sense that using sound to develop a rich
texture had a philosophical/theological point behind it: that rhymes were
a matter of Natural Convergences.  So, using rhyme, you were either the
Great Artificer or the Transcendental Sound Conveyor, and either way you
were screwed ("no intuitive well of sonic richness," Bob Perelman
insisted).  A third option was/is doggerel: which has a long interesting
history but it's tough avoiding "There once was a man from NantucketÉ" and
I think with doggerel you fall into the same problems we discussed
regarding parody.  So.  So I think some younger poets are finding
interesting, experimental ways to use rhyme, partly thanks to hip-hop,
partly perhaps thanks to the various language theories focussed in on the
materiality of the work.  Part of the pain-in-the-ass that was Rhymed
Poetry involved it's marriage to Narrative Poetry: so that the real sign
of excellence involved keeping your rhymes invisible, out of the way of
your story but nonetheless heard as sweet music.  But what if rhyme
actually drives what's being said:

I walked in the forest like an elephant
Everything I saw seemed irrelevant

I walked through the forest like a donkey
Everything I saw seemed on key

I flew over the river Volga
Around it milled a people vulgar

That's from Eugene Ostashevsky's "I Locked the House of Myself" which is
in Combo 7.  The joke about rhyme directing narrative ("Everything I saw
seemed on key") is played out in the next couplet where the people are
vulgar not because they are vulgar (and here the poem takes on political
overtones for me) but because of the need for an approximate sound.  As I
said, hip-hop often has this emphasis on the materiality of rhyme
(jump-rope rhymes do to) and that first couplet reminds me of these ones
from Busta Rhymes, "I roam through the forest / just like a Brontosaurus /
Born in the month of may so my sign is Taurus / I kick you in the face
like my fuckin' name was Chuck Norris."  (I suppose there's a narrative
coherence in the idea of masculine toughness but it's really about the
search for a rhyme ÐÐ the giveaway is in the need to keep extending the
meter.)

So, I find this a very interesting possibility.  It's been around ÐÐ
Gertrude Stein does it with nursery rhyme adaptations, Harryette Mullen
brings not only Stein but a whole history of African American speaking to
bear on the use of rhyme in poems.  Another writer doing it is Mark
Sardinha (also in Combo 7, see "Stick me in a rib cage"), who I think is
aided in his ability to put a new twist on it by his fluency in
Portuguese.]

Here is Sardinha's poem:

stick me in
a rib cage play

me for my
xylophone

losing sucks
the marrow bone but

atrophy ainÕt everything


monkey in your
space garage

doing ether
these and dozed

damage in the fuselage
to the tune of subterfuge

in a room of telephones


        dust me off a love song
        for another fishing hole

        spear me please
        the rib cage

        put down
        the megaphone


just a finger cut
off years ago

flotilla in
a fish bowl

Eve-seen men
dispense with knees

crawling in a traffic zone


        blame me for
        a pill of lint

        I havenÕt got
        the slightest rib

        take me
        for one of those

[NOTE: If this is interesting you at all, here's how our conversation
continued.  Lastly, there's a poem of my own in this vein at the bottom of
the page.]

MITCH: the idea of artifice seems important here.  It seems like a
dominant trend in late 20th cent. art and poetry is the desire to erase
artifice (whatever that means, it's all artifice). Having art more closely
approximate life, or art which has such a logical structure that its own
directness denies artifice. Poems whose line structure mirrors the length
of a breath, poems which have an off-the-cuff casualness, chatty like
O'Hara. Art, like Minimalism that exists in the space that you and I
inhabit, not the same space as a Rodin. This is realism, I guess, the same
sort of impulse that made Caravaggio paint the way he painted rather than
painting like Carracci.

However, the use of rhyme seems to go against this impulse. This seems
great and important but I don't know why.  Maybe this is a way to become
real again; what was a language the seemed to tear down artifice now seems
artificial so that in order to feel *real* and authentic again one must go
through the backdoor of artifice.  Certainly this is the case for Currin
(and maybe every other contemporary artist we've been talking about).  The
work (I think, but maybe not everyone would see it this way) feels
"authentic" *because* of its artificial structure. I don't know.

Anyway, it may be that Ostashevsky's poems function a bit in this way,
rhyme is dumb and contrived which is a good thing because it allows one to
address a whole set of issues which could not be addressed in a
conventional ÐÐ or rather, conventional avant-garde ÐÐ  poem.

Now the notion of rhyme as it relates to African American cultural history
may be a whole 'nother ball of wax, but it is important to the discussion.
Let's see, Busta Rhymes is interesting because his rhymes are usually
direct and dumb and he rhymes the same sound over and over and over again.
His stuff feels really off the cuff (improvised) and meaning is derived
not from the narrative but from the line to line, free associative
connections, "how
is he going to get out of this one."  This seems to have a long African
American lineage, certainly back to minstrelsy; A near-present day example
of this comedic rhyming style, thought horrible, is Nipsy Russell. So
Busta Rhymes takes on the artificial Jester role to arrive at something
real, he goes through the back door.

There's a lot of freedom gained, but a lot of authority lost, in playing
the clown.  I actually want my art to head more in that direction. Sean
Landers is a good artist to look at in terms of playing the fool. Right
now I'd say my art is a bit drier than I want it to be.

MIKE:  It's amazing how what you say about artifice and realism here
echoes a statement by the language poet Charles Bernstein (who
incidentally does work sometimes w/ rhyme in a way not unlike what I've
been describing although I would say his version is playing more on
Nursery rhymes and less on hip hop rhymes (if at all).  Anyway, Bernstein
says this in a an essay called "The Artifice of Absorption":

Artifice "is a measure of a poem's
intractability to being read as the sum of its
devices & subject matters.  In this sense,
"artifice" is the contradiction of "realism", with
its insistence on presenting an unmediated
(immediate) experience of facts, either of the
"external" world of nature or the "internal" world
of the mind; for example, naturalistic
representation or phenomenological consciousness
mapping.  Facts in poetry are primarily
factitious.

That seems pretty close to what your saying, right?  And I would agree.
What's funny is that Bernstein and his contemporaries shy away from
certain kinds of artifice anyway, probably because the canon was a little
too real for them in the 70s for the techniques found there to be used as
an oppositional practice.  (Poets like Richard Wilbur were still using
very "artificial" forms ÐÐ elaborate, "perfect" schemes of rhyme and meter
ÐÐ toward ends which the Langauge Poets didin't want any part of ÐÐ
precisely because someone like Wilbur was ultimately arguing for the
naturalness of those forms: even if he wouldn't say so, it was the pure
naturalness of "high culture," the rightness of it which underlay his
practice.  Then in the 80s you had the New Formalists following his lead.
So it would've been a tightrope for the Language Poets to try
appropriating heroic couplets or something, and I still don't think you
could do it without really contextualizing it in some way ÐÐ otherwise it
will either simply be heroic couplets, or it will be a parody of them (and
again, this problem of pardoy jumps out ÐÐ who wants to be a parodist?)
On the other hand, you have a young poet like K. Silem Mohammad who is
definitely employing something like High Elizabethan Speech in his poems
(see Combo 4 & 6).  Take this quatrain, which seems to be all about this
very issue of artifice.  Mohammad is very canny about this, as he puts it
in as a footnote (all italicized) to the wildly polyglot poem "Dietary of
Ghostly Health":

I am singing to the nutshell not the kernel of the phrase
I am pining in the outskirts not the heart of the malaise
I bled when I was thirsty and I wept when I was tired
I took the thing I wept for and not what I desired

So here you have, in something of a riddle, a similar discussion of
inside/outside, natural/artifical that you and Bernstein address.  But
again, this isn't that far from "New Formalism" except that the content
(the point about singing to the nutshell and pining in the outskirts) puts
the form in stark relief and as a result puts its authority (as "natural"
or as natural link in a chain of traditional practice) into doubt ÐÐ plus
of course you have the fact that it's contextualized by all sorts of other
speech and writing.  We're back to this issue of appropriation.  Mohammad
clearly isn't just lampooning this "high speech" ÐÐ but neither is he
celebrating it, except in some subversive way.  Is that subversion
social/political or is this a "guilty pleasure" or both.  One of the
things we face is that the work of subverting the Traditional was done for
us ÐÐ do sonnets really need any more subverting??  Or naturalists
paintings (or for that matter Ab Ex paintings which aspire to
"psychological depth")??  There's always the option to subvert immediate
high profile predecessors (for the sake of simplicity let's say
Minimalists of many stripes and Language Poets) but who cares?  And on top
of who cares that always depends on or at least falls into an Oedipal
narrative which itself has been debunked and looks ridiculous.  Phooey.
Plus I like the collaborative, both within and across generations.

Interesting that you bring up O'Hara.  I think the "naturalness" of his
writing, the chatty "hey, so I'm going to lunch" aspect, is natural-ized
by his immediate followers more than by O'Hara himself.  For one thing,
early O'Hara can feel very artificial, in the best sense, even using
"dumb" rhymes in the way we've been discussing: "At night Chinamen jump /
on Asia with a thump," and then later in the poem my personal favorite,
"these apples roll beneath  our buttocks like a heath // full of Chinese
thrushes / flushed from China's bushes."  Talk about artificial!  It turns
the "mystery" of China and Chinese people inside out ÐÐ that poem should
be called "I don't know shit about China."  The later O'Hara ÐÐ the "I do
this I do that" poems, are artificial in a different way: it has to do
with thinking of the Self as theatrical: like in "Why I am Not a Painter"
the way his descriptions of his own movements feel like stage directions
ÐÐ "I drop inÉI goÉI goÉI drop in."  You're right, though, the
off-the-cuff casualness can make O'Hara feel like a beat poet sometimes,
like Gregory Corso, say (who O'Hara really admired) and the issue of the
line being the length of a breath (Olson's idea associated w/ the Black
Mountain poets) was certainly necessary as a way to opt out of the
Formalism of the Day but had its own pitfalls too.  Actually, if you read
O'Hara's "Personism: A Manifesto" as a response to (if not a full
repudiation of) Olson's "Projective Verse" (where this line/breath
connection takes full flower), then this oft-quoted line of O'Hara's
becomes pretty interesting:

As for measure and for other technical apparatus, that's just common
sense: if you're going to buy a pair of pants you want them to be tight
enough so everyone will want to go to bed with you.  There's nothing
metaphysical about it.  Unless of course you flatter yourself into
thinking that what you're experiencing is "yearning."


Of course some poets & critics say that that's precisely what O'Hara was
experiencing, yearning, and that desire is his metaphysics, his
transcendental Signifier.  I don't buy that though.

About "Publish on Demand", michael amberwind writes:

<is it really a revolution in publishing, or simply vanity
publishing in a new package?>

I reply:

To the best of my knowledge, Print on Demand is a printing process,
nothing more. How it's used, and by whom, is a different question
entirely.

The books themselves look much better than they did a few years ago
(they look MUCH better than trade paperbacks, btw).

From what I've gathered, after an initial print run of as little as 50 or
so, the book sits at the printer (virtually), waiting for more orders. I've
heard it's very cost-effective. And, best of all, I've heard that these
books don't go out of print (or get put in land fills!).

Because it's very cost-effective, it could very well be used for self-
publishing. Very little overhead (though how little I'm not sure). I
think it will be the way things are done at most small publishers in the
near future. And probably at all vanity presses. (Which will, as always,
be two different issues, though problematically so in some cases [ugh:
and not in others, ugh-ugh].)

Of course I could be completely wrong here.

From Publisher's Weekly:

Consummate Bookseller Ted Wilentz Dies at 86

Seriously ill for the last two years with heart and lung problems, Ted
Wilentz died on Tuesday at the age of 86, leaving a legacy of more than 60
years in all aspects of bookselling. His philosophy was an oft-quoted maxim
that a good bookseller should be "behind the writers and ahead of the
readers."

Perhaps best known as the co-owner (with his brother Eli) of Manhattan's
Eighth Street Bookshop, a literary landmark from 1947 until it closed in
1979, Wilentz's experience in books started a decade earlier and continued
until his death. Among other things, he was ABA president for the 1965-66
term, created a publishing house (Corinth Books) and worked as a consultant
for independent bookstores.

In 1937, Wilentz and four friends opened a book and stationery store in the
Bronx, N.Y. The store blossomed into three over the next few years. At the
outbreak of World War II, Wilentz signed up and served in the Army for five
years. By the end of the war, however, only one store remained, which
Wilentz and his brother Eli ran together.

The brothers then bought a Womrath bookstore/lending library franchise.
When the franchise agreement expired, they renamed the three-floor
bookstore the Eighth Street Bookshop and fine-tuned the store--dumping the
unprofitable lending library and expanding the stock of backlist titles.

Along with the promotion of backlist, the bookstore was an early champion
of paperbacks. In Book Business (Norton), Jason Epstein remembers "the
thrilling Eighth Street Bookshop, a bibliographer's paradise and an
informal school for many fledgling publishers in those days."

He continued, "It was here that the idea for Anchor Books first occurred to
me." The imprint sought to bring readers quality paperback editions
(printed on acid-free paper) of classics. The Wilentz brothers stood behind
the new idea by creating a paperback section and placing an initial order
of 100 copies of each of Anchor's first 12 titles.

The Eighth Street Bookshop was also known for its social scene. "Before I
met and married Ted in 1965, I remember the Eighth Street Bookshop being
the equivalent of a singles bar in the '50s," Joan Wilentz told PW Daily.
"It was such an exciting venue. We just drooled over the titles available.
There was just a wave of exciting talents in that post-World War II
generation that partied at each other's houses."

The brothers founded Corinth Books in 1959 to publish books that reflected
their personal tastes and beliefs. Over the years, Corinth published or
co-published a number of important works, many by young and upcoming
writers, including several collections of Beat writings, Diane di Prima's
Dinner and Nightmares, Charles Olson's The Maximus Poems, Jack Kerouac's
The Scripture of the Golden Eternity and Allen Ginsberg's Empty Mirror.

"Ted was very interested in new writing and became interested in the Beat
generation," said Joan Wilentz. "He supported lots of projects like
[avante-garde literary magazine] Floating Bear edited by Diane di Prima and
LeRoi Jones. In fact, Le Roi's wife, Hettie Jones, worked as Ted's
secretary for a while. Painter Robert Smithson worked in the store shipping
books. Ted would buy paintings from them to support them financially. When
he was not publishing, Ted found other ways to support artists and
writers--in never-to-be-paid loans to Kerouac or Neal Cassidy, an exchange
of a drawing or painting for a few dollars, or just standing them to a meal
or beers at the Cedar Street Tavern."

In 1967, Wilentz sold his half of the bookstore to his brother (the Eighth
Street Bookshop was destroyed by an arson fire in 1976, but thanks to
public support, reopened six months later and finally closed in 1979). He
held several jobs during the next few years, including manager at
Brentano's Fifth Avenue location, manager of the Sierra Club's publications
and vice-president of the Gotham Book Mart. He even opened another
bookstore, The Discovery Bookstore, which specialized in smaller presses
and out of print titles.

He closed the bookstore to move to New Haven, Conn., as director of the
Yale Co-Op's book department. After seven years in this position, at the
age of 65, he decided to retire. But instead of resting, he became a
business consultant, helping independent bookstores.

In 1980, Wilentz became a minority shareholder in the new book remainder
company, Daedalus Books. "Ted came in at a time when we didn't have much
money and was a great supporter in terms of financial consultation and
moral support," Daedalus president Robin Moody told PW Daily. "He was a
very savvy consultant. He would read a financial statement like a novel and
knew exactly what that company needed. He was also such a nice man, beloved
by everyone. It was a great pleasure to enjoy his sunny optimism. If you
were walking down aisles at BEA with him, you couldn't have a goal, because
everyone wanted to stop and talk to him."

In the 1980s, he served as an overseas volunteer in the International
Executive Service Club, an organization that took company presidents to
foreign lands to offer advice to struggling businesses. In this capacity,
he flew to Kano, Nigeria, spending two months advising bookstores. A
successful trip to Cairo, Egypt, followed. For the rest of his life, he
continued to work as a book consultant, advising, among others, Jeannette
Watson, owner of the Manhattan's Books & Co., which became a literary
landmark of its own from 1977 through 1997.

"Ted was a believer in talent and it was a wonderful coincidence that he
started a bookstore when there was a tremendous amount of excitement in the
publishing industry," Joan Wilentz told PW Daily. "There was a new breath
of life in fiction and poetry and he was part of it."--Kevin Howell

Hi all, I just heard that Billy Higgins has died, and thought some of you
would want to know.  Playing Ornette Coleman's "Congeniality" on my imac
right now - this is really sad. Better drummers perhaps - Roach, Elvin,
Tony Williams?  But no one to my mind ever came across as LIVE as Billy
Higgins on The Shape of Jazz to Come.  Life changing for me when I first
heard it.   -m.

As somebody who is involved in running a small poetry press, I can tell you
that while publishing-on-demand is a standard rip-off, printing-on-demand is
the best thing to happen to poetry publishing in a long time. If you are
willing to take control of your book by self-publishing, that is prepairing
electronic files, getting ISBN numbers, finding a digital-on-demand printer,
negotiating prices, distribution, etc, you can save a lot of money.

Came across a reference to Bense in Queneau's "Potential Literature": "We
are not concerned with experimental or aleatory literature (as it is
practiced, for example, by Max Bense's group in Stuttgart)."

Can anyone point me to English or French sources about Bense? I can find
scads of German and Portugese material on the web, but I don't read either
of those languages.

I'm particularly interested in what he may/might be doing in
automatic/automated text generation.

Thanks for any pointers,

San Francisco Beat is an essential rememberance of the Beat Generation,
a rich moment in a fortunate place. America, somnolent, conformist, and
paranoid in the 1950s, was changed forever by a handful of people who
refused an existence of drudgery and enterprise, opting instead for a
life of personal, spiritual, and artistic adventure. In these intimate,
free-wheeling conversations, a baker's dozen of the poets of San
Francisco talk about the scene then and now, the traditions of poetry,
and about anarchism, globalism, Zen, the Bomb, the Kabbalah, and the
Internet.

San Francisco Beat features major recent interviews with Diane di Prima,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jack Hirschman, Joanne Kyger, Philip Lamantia,
Michael McClure, Jack Micheline, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen--as well
as with David Meltzer himself.

Also included are David Meltzer's historic interviews with his poet
friends Kenneth Rexroth, Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, William
Everson, and Lew Welch--an archive of the San Francisco Renaissance
first published thirty years ago in The San Francisco Poets. Now San
Francisco Beat: Talking with the Poets complements these important
records of the time with follow-up interviews with the living or with
friends of the missing.

David Meltzer is the author of many books of poetry, including Tens, The
Name, Arrows: Selected Poetry 1957-1992, and No Eyes: Lester Young. He
is the editor of Birth: An Anthology of Ancient Texts, Songs, Prayers,
and Stories, The Secret Garden: Anthology of the Classical Kabbalah,
Reading Jazz, and Writing Jazz, among other collections. His agit-smut
fictions include Orf, The Agency Trilogy, and Under. Meltzer read poetry
at the Jazz Cellar in the 1950s and in the 1960s fronted the psychedelic
band, Serpent Power. He taught writing in Vacaville Prison but these
days David Meltzer teaches poetics at New College of California in San
Francisco.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Personally, I'd avoid pejoratizing these innovations into obsolete
dismissals such as "vanity."  (Making an idea-term like "vanity press"
into common currency effectively condemned and inhibited independent
publication, and gave the field over to monopolization and its ongoing
dysfunctions.)

You are right that 108 pp. could be a stretch for some poets and is
definitely above the 60 pp.-ish standard. (It may be "worse" with other
print-on-demands like XLibris [whom I otherwise endorse] who have
word-count minimums, I believe around --- 30,000 words?)

However, it isn't as a platform for single poet editions that I
necessarily see print-on-demand's potential.

In short, and to get to the point---

It seems readymade for poetry ~anthologies.~

Or collections of ready-to-wear criticism.

Brian Kim Stefans has shared at least one print-on-demand volume of
mini-reviews here on the EPC, I'd guess.  And, hey, ---Al!  There's a
sagging SHELFful of Sondheim I don't know why he or some devotee isn't
print-on-demand-ing in addition to his CD.

I'd even take the anthology gambit a step further and--- like to
~propose~ that an EPC-focussed anthology be taken on and concluded as a
"summer project" for fall availability.

I'd be happy to serve as focal point/editor, if no one else jumps.

(Certainly a Gary Sullivan or a Jerrold Shiroma or Stroffolino, et al.,
have more public visibility and experience in that role, . . .)

Recent postings, like the one about "The School of Continuation" (Hollo,
Ducharme [sp.?], etc.), or someone else's --- I can't recall whose ---
who just laxly put it out there sort of tongue-in-cheek baiting Hey
maybe we should start a new school and what should we call it, guys---

the intuition behind those postings betray, I'd suspect, a latent
suspicion that a new "school" or movement in fact ~has~ broken through
and taken on proportions broader than the previous catch-all
"post-Language" (or has facets which contradict or in fact
"revolutionize" the Language status quo, endlessly generational Oedipal
father dethronings).

(I would say "EPC-centered" not in an exclusionary sense --- although
it's often by following an EPC lead that I find non-EPC poets that
thrill me whom I don't know and would love to read more of or personally
try to help publish more of, Jason Lynn in the new yellow Lungfull as a
most recent f'r-instance [yellow?  Like many males and very many men
Czechoslovak-descent males, I'm faintly color-blind, just in case it's a
bright lime, don't get on my case, Lorb'].

But I do say "EPC" because I think that the approximation of "community"
that perpetuates itself here is in fact quite novel: a coterie of people
who do ~not~ know each other, per se, and who are ~not~ friends [and
might not be if they met], have never seen each other's faces, and so
on.  [Certain archaic localizations still flare up: The Southern
Coalition split itself off, I guess, into their own local contingency
after that southern literary journal featured them all, taking )ohn
Souther [was that his name?] down with them [somebody posted for )ohn's
e-mail address recently.  Where is that guy?  Say hi if he's above
ground.  He used to be cyber-toastmaster]--- and the Bostonians cling to
their own spatialities by clustering around their annual dog days
festival.  Time/space continuum atavists.  Etc.]).

What d'you think?

Comments: To: Ron Silliman <ron.silliman@gte.net>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Thank you, "Professor" Silliman/Mr. .tylr, for your Apollonian/Dionysiac
replies, respectively.

I'll check my bookshelves for Ketjak, Tjanting, etc., this weekend when I get
home.---  The long Silliman poem structured on Fibonacci numbers (in the book
with the yellow cover) was very startling and important for me in the
mid-'80's.  (I'd appreciate a full citation on Quindecagon, as I blush to admit
that book may have escaped my collection, bounding off down cobbled road like a
salt biscuit with three-toed feet in an illustrated nursery rhyme.).

Somewhere beneath your reply, Ron, I sense (or infer) an unstated point about
Language prosody:

---that the word-as-unit may have replaced the syllable-as-unit, in many cases.

(Along those lines, Goddess Perloff's critique book made much of Creeley's
word-counting as a neo-metric.)  I hope you know that my question is not meant
as dismissive or ignorant of the prosodic sophistication and subtleties in
canonical Language writers---  the metrics in a Howe or Armantrout are perhaps
the type that most kinaesthetically gets through to me as palpable,
unmistakable.  And, as I've largely gone over from poetry into (attempts at)
writing music in the past year and a half, Grenier's are foremost among the
texts I'm re-reading for possible settings.

Perhaps what I had in mind---

Yes, in a nod to .tylr, sure, primitive meters like the iambic pentameter
resurgency were old hat, basically.  More pernicious still, their essays that
I've read rooting the buh-BUM iamb in--- the heart's systole/diastole! a
totally anti-Saussurean pseudo-linguistics whose danger lies strongly in its
reversing or eliding the whole principle of "arbitrary" that you mention.

Here and there, though, these N.F. codgers have appropriated historical
inheritance that I don't think "we" should be ceding over so uncontested (go
ahead, old crab-apple-faced N.F.-ers!  you can have Catullus, Alcaics,--- take
it all!  [Courtney Love lyric echo: "Go on!  Take everything!  Take
everything!  I like it!"]  We're sated to claim 22nd century Brownian movement
as our libertarian ping pong!).

An effort that especially interested me (out of their otherwise generally
offputting literature) was the Catullus castration ode imitation that the
former Poetry (Chicago) editor John Middle-Name
Possible-Three-Syllable-Last-Name-Ending-in-"-er"?-Maybe-&-with-an-"ei"-in-It-Possibly
published as the last poem (?) in a book with a black cloth cover, sort of
squarish in dimensions.   ---Especially because (oh Lord! this name-and-face
agnosia disability of mine!) one of ~our~ forefathers --- help me out here,
Ron, you're still sane --- did a really special translation of the Catullus
original (y'know, Ron, everybody, that polyphonic translation?). Ode starts
with a boat bounding over waves, . . . it's the single instance of a metric
line almost impossible to imitate in English because it has like five
unstresseds in a row . . . "ego flos gymnasii", that ring a bell?

I think what I ~do not~ know is whether there is some intrinsic, idiopathic
propensity toward skill with elaborate metrics.

I mean, if some people are "good at it" and wind up continuing doing it because
they've got a knack and it's sort of fun to flaunt that they can trip off these
metricall rills---

and if other people (apologies in advance) never quite get the swing of
macron/breve so wind up successfully re-territorializing themselves into "free
verse"-ishness, as I think William Carlos Williams' early metrical efforts
show.  (It's not an insult to say this!  On some level, Juan Miro, like the
Douannier Rousseau, simply never had the draftsmanship at drawing that his
beaux arts confreres had, and the option of modernism was a wonderful haven
that allowed his genius and drive to flourish, a gift to us all, everybody
smilin'.)

The political curve you mention ("Politics of Poetic Form") you state with
great diagrammable clarity, in brief:

Langpo       =      n>1 components   =    ProLPo (prosody of Langpo)
~plus~    pure "non-d/a"comp ("non-discursive/...").

Thanks.

But the political "mischief" I'm envisioning is--- if New Formalism equals
ProNF plus pure ~disc~/~synt~ (if New Formalism's components are conspicuously
normative syntax and classical meters),---

what happens to the political reverberations if any two of these (Greimas
post-structuralist grid) components are abhorrently re-coupled?  (Mules?)  The
de-coupling of poetic discursivity  from classical meter already happened and
was called "free verse."  Asyntactical non-discursivity in classical meter
would ~re-claim~ the entire pre-modernist lineage as entirely compatible with
if not forerunner to the International Avant-Garde.  Democrats don't say well
alright you crusties go and take America we'll be Futurians from now on.

Tennyson, rather than being the old boring grampa NF-ists would have us
believe, was an extreme weirdo in his Formalism, freakishly inventive, often
risking asynt' non-disc' to stretch a foot. (Tennyson at the 1800s/1900s
fin-de-siecle, Ashbery at the 1900s/2000s fin-de-siecle: almost identical
fulcrums in their innovative/conservative blend.)

The paradox is that meter is ~ludic~ in its game-like play,--- and the ludic is
associated with the post-modern.  But it is Language Poetry that is thought to
be post-modern and New Formalism as anti-modernist.

I may have some efforts at classical meter Language-ishness in my papers.  I'll
rummage and maybe post them as f'r-instances, see what you think of the fusion.

Jeffrey. The New Formalists writing in metre and rhyme are a pathetic lot.
Who wants to be bound by a lot of quite arbitrary rules? I would and will
write in any way I want  (until one is shot for such an attitude). Certainly
its important to have some understanding of metre and the history and
certain grammatical subtleties: but if a form is "required" it will be
found. Obviously its not really possible to be "formless". The NFs have
taken one set of arbitrary forms and now they "worship" those forms. Even
apart from the stuff going on in and on cyberspace: there's room for a vast
range of invention and originality and complexity (or "simplicity" if you
want it)...one of the things the Langpos have "bequeathed" and continue to
practise is the "right" to write. The right to write and write. This write
thus then becomes much more than a rite. The reader is challenged. The
writers are challenged. Language is challenged. Shakespeare and all those
old guys get turned on their heads. People start thinking about things
instead of  being sucked into a morass of mush. If challenging poetry is
difficult and interesting but unpopular then so much the better.
  The New Formalists are wasting everyone's time.  Let's attack them: satire
and sarcasm: that's what we need...the ghost of Swift...
  Death to New Formalism! Richard.

New from Granary Books

Bed Hangings

a poem by Susan Howe with pictures by Susan Bee

In *Bed Hangings*, poet Susan Howe and artist Susan Bee collaborate for the first time. This series of poems explores the themes of colonial America and its decorative arts, religion and Puritanism through a visual and verbal investigation of the metaphysics of beds, curtains and hangings. The poems and pictures play off against each other in a humorous, mystical and sometimes mischievous manner.

"Between sleep and waking these poems hang like the bed-curtains which are also the curtains in which the theater of insomnia plays itself out. Stitched into the tapestries are those emblems of the world--'fair trees wrought with a needle'--that in the wakeful dark may reduce to the flax or woolen stuff out of which they are wrought, or seem to embody doctrines and secret histories otherwise ineffable. Susan Howe's poetry and Susan Bee's visual response to that poetry come together beautifully in a book apt for beguiling the small hours of the night." -- Geoffrey O'Brien

" 'What parts, what gems, what colours shine!' Let me wax enthusiastical about a new and perfect match of genius between quaintness and postmodernity, between -- as it were -- Edward Gorey and Ian Hamilton Finlay. These learned delights are a lyric romp appropriate to any bedding and bedside, and a lot beside. Hooray!" --Mary Ann Caws

"Aubade, lullaby, reticent prothalamion, *Bed Hangings* charms at the edge
of language like a satin binding on a wool selvage: in delight awhile." -- Susan Stewart

Printed offset. Bound in paper wrappers. Twenty-six copies are signed by Susan Howe and Susan Bee.  10" x 7", 48 pages, edition of 1500. ISBN: 1-887123-47-4. $14.95.

An announcement that we've made a link to Paul Quinn's excellent article on
his visit to the Poetics Program at Buffalo last spring. You can find this
link on the EPC Media page at:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/about/media/
Paul Quinn is an engaging writer and the article touches on various aspects
of his visit to Buffalo against the backdrop of our abandoned grain
elevators, a very enjoyable read indeed.

Subject:      Re: Publish on Demand [EPC Anthology?]
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I like the idea of using print-on-demand to bring forth a larger book, like
an anthology.  The problem I have with anthologies is that there are too
many of them: an anthology of this or that comes out every couple of years
it seems, & this blunts their effectiveness while also highlighting how
arbitrary they are.  (You didn't get in that anthology?  Wait til the next
one!)  Whereas the notion of an anthology DEFINING a generation at a crucial
moment, as The New American Poetry *seemed* to, comes to feel increasingly
elitist-- not just because there is always somebody interesting you're going
to have to exclude, but that the belief that any one editorial slant has the
vantage to capture what's going on while in the mix of it comes to feel
silly & irrelevant.  I doubt Jeffrey's right that "a new 'school' or
movement" has emerged since the heyday of "postlanguage" (which after all
was a *term* not a movement).  There's too much variousness for any kind of
broad, common purpose, methinks-- which isn't a bad thing, actually.  That
said, I wouldn't be opposed to a Poetics anthology (actually, to prove my
point, it would be the second one).  Participation in this list is a totally
arbitrary critereon for inclusion-- which is exactly what might make such a
project interesting.

Jeffrey. The things you are talking about (by the way I'm  miles from being
a professor I've worked most of my life as a labourer or sometimes a tech
and was mainly a linesman/cablejointer...I've done virtually no clerical
work except my recent spree as a book shop assistant and now a book
seller/dabbler..of  I have an Enginereing Cert. (Telecoms electronics, and
finishe d a BA (English) at Ayck Uni 1995)). But back to this issue: I'll
jump a bit..I think that what you are saying in part or referring to is the
very strangeness of this arbitrariness. Rhyme metre etc are quite arbitrary
things (or they arre not in a sense: rhyme derives partly from its use in
learning language, as a memory aid, and eg Stein since has talked about
persistence of memory produced by repetition (which also has the effect of
increasing the semantic branchings so to speak that radiate as words
interact)). The traditional metre - which when one thinks about it - IS
strange. And it has had (as rhyme does) a powerful part to play. Any system
though is "artificial"..hence a good book to look at is "Radical Artiifice"
by Perloff or even Veronica Forrest-Thompson's book Poetic Artifice (that
Ramez Qureshi so brilliantly talked about and also in relation to J H
Prynne). The various "language" poets (including Grenier and say Inman) may
seem to be abandoning meaning and structure or oblivious to rhyme or metre
etc etc but this is quite wrong. They have simply,or complexly, challenged
the conservative artificialities that were in place...but no one would
suggest that structure or form thus must or does would should is go(ing)  or
go. Even if one TRIES to make a random structure (or works "off the cuff" so
to speak as J Ashbery does) a form is found or finds itself: a pattern, a
ryhthm. But the patterns and rhythms are not dictated by  some
traditionalist formula. They may be preplanned or discovered: but it is
impossible to avoid meaning or some structure.[Doesthe Universelook like a
great Iambic Poem in the post Hawkinsinain Universe or Universes?] In R S's
case there's eg the fibonnacci series or golden number: John Cage utilised a
psuedo random system and the I Ching....McCaffery's "Lag" (as desciribed by
Perloff brilliantly in her book "Radical Artifice") is at first sight
"meaningless"..and lacks any obvious "rhythm" and looks nothing like
Tennyson or Herbert or Crashaw or anyone else: but what is seen is meaning
generation and attention is drawn to that process.McCaffery, Silliman, all
those writers, are found to be both intensely meaningful and as fascinating
, and if you like, as "beautiful" as anything you once loved by Keats or
Shakespear. Its just that the beauty's form has transformed: it has not
become "intellectual" (all writing has to be intellectual, or "lacking in
heart or spontaneity"  or "dry" (witness the marvellous
lyricality/intellection of Michelle Leggott's work or that of her "mentor"
Zukovsky in his sonnet sequence in `A'  or his "Flowers".  This is one of
the developments. The age of Tennyson etc is over: we are dealing with new
ideas, new philosophies, a new and quite different social structure, art and
music have  taken light-jumps right into and beyond conceptualism...sure
certain deep fundalmentals remain, no problem there...but to challenge or
confront this world we are currently in requires an honesty but also an
ingenuity and an awareness of the value of Art. Its value is partly in its
artificial nature, its constructiveness, its ludicness and its seriousnss,
and its comicality. that is the freedom(if we have any) we have gained (as
MEMBERS OF THE WORKING CLASS  [any one who does not actually own or control
the means of prodution]). That freedom has been earnt through struggle. But
its an ongoing struggle (inextricably mixed with political social
struggles). It is our struggle. A poetical philosophical political struggle:
a struggle to breathe.
  The old forms, used now, produce weak, often insincere art that
masquerades as the art of "concern"...but often its a failure to face
certain realities: we may be aware of W C W's "pecadillos", but his "no
ideas but in things" and his emphasis on the imagination are vital ideas. I
read an essay by John Ashbery (on Clare) in which he says (as I too have
always thought) that for him ideas are also things. (I think WCW's was aware
of that, but any way many have become confused on that). Rhetoric begins to
replace intense writing as one descends into NewFormalism. Language poetry
and or its derivatives and forms is high energy and living poetry (NF is
dead wood, sludge produced by poetic slugs). Nor does this high energy
writing have to be dull or "unmusical"...its musicality, or the musical
muscle of its ideation, takes on new forms. Some of those forms are seen now
on various links I've received to certain "cyber artist/poets" but the
ongoing possibilities for experiment and novelty and creativity are
unlimited regardless of the media used.
 I dont need to go on. The dinosuars, I think, died out, not because of
meteors or external "catastrophes", but because they lacked the adaptability
to many changing conditions that mammals had and have. They were slow and
stupid if it got cold. Their barins were very small (the "reasoning part" of
them at least").The New Formalists are the dinosaurs of literature trying to
re-Frankenstein themselves. They are dead already. Their project is quite
simply stupid: they're thickos...they require a Duciad: a voltage burnt thru
their precious crania. Although Pope's Dunciad was perhaps too much directed
at individuals, but lets not discuss the New Foramalists...
   The word as unit: ok that's one way...but its the reaction of the
eye/mind/brain on that word or phraseunit. And its where and why one would
use such units or methods: its away from either simplistic realism or weak
romanticism towards both a more intelligent and interesting thinking and
presenting  - and playing - and in many cases wea re re-confronted with the
mystery and the beauty of language but also with the reality of language and
the alternative psuedo-realities that the NFsm would deal up. Reality as far
as we can know it and as far as we can deal with it and thus reality (I know
the term is problematic) that we are wary of but half in love with, half or
two thirds in anger at: but at least we see it. Unclouded by the mesmeric
miasma of rumpa tumpa tumpa tum, we hear those lovely rhymes, those sirenic
songs, but we are tied fast to our mast: we can master, we are not
overmastered, we'll Deutschland it, we'll Grendel wrestle it, we'll be in
there in a Cincinatti shoot out...but we wont wishy washy iambify or
monotone the blood that may be spilt...we'll even takes sides and 'deal'
with this execution...we'll face it...we have the tools ...we can see...we
can hear if we cant see..or sense.. our senses are alive.. we are thinking
and language and idea machines... we are human...we'll eye...we'll
eye...we'll "eye" it all.

Cheers, Richard Taylor.

Jeffrey,

Quindecagon can be found in (R), published by Drogue, available through SPD
and probably Bridge Street Books as well.

The book with the yellow cover is The Age of Huts and has no Fibonacci
related work in it, actually. Tjanting, which does use Fibonacci throughout,
has a cover by John Baldesarri. Salt will be bringing out a new edition
aimed at audiences in the UK & Australia, hopefully later this year -- right
in the midst of proofreading as we speak.

There are also some moments of Fibonacci in Lit, published by Potes & Poets.

[And, to be really perverse, I've been reading the Danish poet Inger
Christensen's booklength poem Alphabet(!!), which itself is based on
Fibonacci, amazed to discover these correspondences with my own work, tho
her uses thereof are radically different.]

I was intrigued to see that when someone (Mike Magee?) posted my quotation
from the Dunn interview onto the New Poetry listserv, it was characterized
as Dunn-bashing. I was quoting the man and if his own words are perceived as
Dunn-bashing, he should speak more judiciously.

Counting words rather than syllables has a solid root in the work of
Zukofsky and certainly is a possibility. Baudelaire wrote prose sonnets
counting sentences, after all. We're discussing stylistic innovations as old
as the music of Stephen Foster and those who fail to acknowledge same ought
to recognize where in the gelatin of the world's history they've been
frozen. (Not, incidentally, the case with Dunn, whose strategy of writing
"better free verse" as a response to the challenge posed by so-called new
formalism seems perfectly reasonable.)

What has always amazed me most about the so-called NF is their disinterest
in form and the reduction of that idea to mere pattern. The new patternism
is more like it.

Tennyson's wife was the niece of Sir John Franklin, my great great great
grandfather. [Franklin's first wife, Eleanor Anne Porden (also apparently my
ancestor), was herself a poet of note, writing booklength epics on such
matters as Arctic exploration.] So Tennyson turns out to have been some sort
of distant in-law.

Life is curious,

Ron

Subject: Re: Prosody of Langpo


Thank you, "Professor" Silliman/Mr. .tylr, for your Apollonian/Dionysiac
replies, respectively.

I'll check my bookshelves for Ketjak, Tjanting, etc., this weekend when I
get
home.---  The long Silliman poem structured on Fibonacci numbers (in the
book
with the yellow cover) was very startling and important for me in the
mid-'80's.  (I'd appreciate a full citation on Quindecagon, as I blush to
admit
that book may have escaped my collection, bounding off down cobbled road
like a
salt biscuit with three-toed feet in an illustrated nursery rhyme.).

Somewhere beneath your reply, Ron, I sense (or infer) an unstated point
about
Language prosody:

---that the word-as-unit may have replaced the syllable-as-unit, in many
cases.

(Along those lines, Goddess Perloff's critique book made much of Creeley's
word-counting as a neo-metric.)  I hope you know that my question is not
meant
as dismissive or ignorant of the prosodic sophistication and subtleties in
canonical Language writers---  the metrics in a Howe or Armantrout are
perhaps
the type that most kinaesthetically gets through to me as palpable,
unmistakable.  And, as I've largely gone over from poetry into (attempts at)
writing music in the past year and a half, Grenier's are foremost among the
texts I'm re-reading for possible settings.

Perhaps what I had in mind---

Yes, in a nod to .tylr, sure, primitive meters like the iambic pentameter
resurgency were old hat, basically.  More pernicious still, their essays
that
I've read rooting the buh-BUM iamb in--- the heart's systole/diastole! a
totally anti-Saussurean pseudo-linguistics whose danger lies strongly in its
reversing or eliding the whole principle of "arbitrary" that you mention.

Here and there, though, these N.F. codgers have appropriated historical
inheritance that I don't think "we" should be ceding over so uncontested (go
ahead, old crab-apple-faced N.F.-ers!  you can have Catullus, Alcaics,---
take
it all!  [Courtney Love lyric echo: "Go on!  Take everything!  Take
everything!  I like it!"]  We're sated to claim 22nd century Brownian
movement
as our libertarian ping pong!).

An effort that especially interested me (out of their otherwise generally
offputting literature) was the Catullus castration ode imitation that the
former Poetry (Chicago) editor John Middle-Name
Possible-Three-Syllable-Last-Name-Ending-in-"-er"?-Maybe-&-with-an-"ei"-in-It-Possibly
published as the last poem (?) in a book with a black cloth cover, sort of
squarish in dimensions.   ---Especially because (oh Lord! this name-and-face
agnosia disability of mine!) one of ~our~ forefathers --- help me out here,
Ron, you're still sane --- did a really special translation of the Catullus
original (y'know, Ron, everybody, that polyphonic translation?). Ode starts
with a boat bounding over waves, . . . it's the single instance of a metric
line almost impossible to imitate in English because it has like five
unstresseds in a row . . . "ego flos gymnasii", that ring a bell?

I think what I ~do not~ know is whether there is some intrinsic, idiopathic
propensity toward skill with elaborate metrics.

I mean, if some people are "good at it" and wind up continuing doing it
because
they've got a knack and it's sort of fun to flaunt that they can trip off
these
metricall rills---

and if other people (apologies in advance) never quite get the swing of
macron/breve so wind up successfully re-territorializing themselves into
"free
verse"-ishness, as I think William Carlos Williams' early metrical efforts
show.  (It's not an insult to say this!  On some level, Juan Miro, like the
Douannier Rousseau, simply never had the draftsmanship at drawing that his
beaux arts confreres had, and the option of modernism was a wonderful haven
that allowed his genius and drive to flourish, a gift to us all, everybody
smilin'.)

The political curve you mention ("Politics of Poetic Form") you state with
great diagrammable clarity, in brief:

Langpo       =      n>1 components   =    ProLPo (prosody of Langpo)
~plus~    pure "non-d/a"comp ("non-discursive/...").

Thanks.

But the political "mischief" I'm envisioning is--- if New Formalism equals
ProNF plus pure ~disc~/~synt~ (if New Formalism's components are
conspicuously
normative syntax and classical meters),---

what happens to the political reverberations if any two of these (Greimas
post-structuralist grid) components are abhorrently re-coupled?  (Mules?)
The
de-coupling of poetic discursivity  from classical meter already happened
and
was called "free verse."  Asyntactical non-discursivity in classical meter
would ~re-claim~ the entire pre-modernist lineage as entirely compatible
with
if not forerunner to the International Avant-Garde.  Democrats don't say
well
alright you crusties go and take America we'll be Futurians from now on.

Tennyson, rather than being the old boring grampa NF-ists would have us
believe, was an extreme weirdo in his Formalism, freakishly inventive, often
risking asynt' non-disc' to stretch a foot. (Tennyson at the 1800s/1900s
fin-de-siecle, Ashbery at the 1900s/2000s fin-de-siecle: almost identical
fulcrums in their innovative/conservative blend.)

The paradox is that meter is ~ludic~ in its game-like play,--- and the ludic
is
associated with the post-modern.  But it is Language Poetry that is thought
to
be post-modern and New Formalism as anti-modernist.

I may have some efforts at classical meter Language-ishness in my papers.
I'll
rummage and maybe post them as f'r-instances, see what you think of the
fusion.

Jeffrey. The New Formalists writing in metre and rhyme are a pathetic lot.
Who wants to be bound by a lot of quite arbitrary rules? I would and will
write in any way I want  (until one is shot for such an attitude). Certainly
its important to have some understanding of metre and the history and
certain grammatical subtleties: but if a form is "required" it will be
found. Obviously its not really possible to be "formless". The NFs have
taken one set of arbitrary forms and now they "worship" those forms. Even
apart from the stuff going on in and on cyberspace: there's room for a vast
range of invention and originality and complexity (or "simplicity" if you
want it)...one of the things the Langpos have "bequeathed" and continue to
practise is the "right" to write. The right to write and write. This write
thus then becomes much more than a rite. The reader is challenged. The
writers are challenged. Language is challenged. Shakespeare and all those
old guys get turned on their heads. People start thinking about things
instead of  being sucked into a morass of mush. If challenging poetry is
difficult and interesting but unpopular then so much the better.
The New Formalists are wasting everyone's time.  Let's attack them: satire
and sarcasm: that's what we need...the ghost of Swift...
Death to New Formalism! Richard.

Dunno about david, but my reservations would condense around "posture
politics".

But two or so things -- last year, no one (really) gave a flying fuck at the
moon over giving Winnie a mohican haircut.  The outrage was the
spraypainting of the war memorial (all dead heroes are sacrosanct).

And it isn't over yet -- wait till the Met get smacked with suits for
wrongful arrest / violation of civil rights / arbitrary confinement. NOT a
good idea to arrest a well-sussed accountant on his way to a fancy dress
ball.

But May1 2001 was over before it started -- BOTH sides were running
misinformation campaigns.  And we have the ludicrous spectacle of Red
(excuse me, I'm really pale pink) Ken Mayor-of-London Livingston trying to
buy his way back into New Labour ...

Oof!!!   david could say all this better than me.

But as an aside, a little ago when I was running around saying to everyone I
knew, "Where were you in 68?", The Real Lady (Hull/68) casually remarked,
"Oh, in the mornings I was on a picket line, afternoons I taught Tennyson,
and in the evenings I was running a refuge for battered wives."

And now what have we? Sixties radicals like Straw and Hain upping the ante
on how-far-right-can-you-go?

Yes indeed.  And Ron Silliman.  And Barrett Watten.

And (to go another, non-LP route), Harry Mathews.  The explorations/
explostions of "traditional" form in _Trial Impressions_ and in _The
Poet's Eye_ (in _Oulipo Laboratory_) out-(per)form the New Formalists.

Merci, Robin

you've said it all for me. Robin's point about 'posture politics' hits the
mark.

In the local the anecdote of focus was about a rioter who revealed his
salary in court: he was on 65, 000 pounds a year. The point of reservation
was 'how could he be an anti-capitalist?'

He was one himself.

It all felt like a tv repeat.


regards to you , Aaron

did i miss something, was i missing something here?
it's five in the morning of the dark light of the soul and we want our
screens bent into unholy shape.
the avant-garde is restless and haunting us with images pasted against the
woolen sky. tonight we're being haunted by the avant-garde.
tonight the avant-garde, tomorrow the experimental.
am i the only one fearing uniforms and guards?
lightning haunts us, wounded by the avant-garde.
experimental and screens wrapped tight around us, we are dying.
surrounded by wool, we are dying.
against the woolen sky.

Michael. I certainly wasnt "against" rhyme or even metre. The NFs as far as
I understand them want a return to some "perfect" and arbitrarily regular
metre. No problem if people want to use these forms in various ways. I
actually found in my own work or poems that I was often (I felt) overusing
rhyme and or alliteration (which I think of as a kind of rhyme). Rhyme to me
( and many other "trad" devices) can be so powerful that they/it should be
in ampules marked: "caution!: extremely addictive, highly potent in tiny
splots, but can cause poems to explode into fireballs of boom" handle and
apply sparingly and with due care...and so on. Rhyme dropped in - even a
long poem in rhyme that is maybe satitic - can be quite wonderful. but the
mechanical applications of rules puts poems back in jail.
 Not in accord with everything of the Langpos but they have given us some
marvellous stuff. Bernstein's point in his poem/poetic I agree...in fact it
is the case (no?) that nothing written is "natural"...undoubtedly there are
different stylistic impulses. There is certainly no inherent or absolute
value in rhyme or metre. Some poets use the sonnet form loosely (just the 14
lines) as a kind of deliberate adumbration of a past and powerful form
(once, rarely now) eg Michelle Leggott of NZ (she also uses double
spacing)..Zukovsky used a certain number of  words per line, Stevens
invented words and took all sorts of liberties, Frost (great poet) kept the
nets up, Ashbery and more so Auden (Auden was a master of all foms it seems
and advised some students that all they needed was the Shorter Oxford (or
was it the very large big daddy one?) and a book on prosody),there are
"ideational rhymes"  as I call them, there's M Moore's complex and very
artificial syllable count per line (corresponding in each stanza), Dylan
Thomas used complex schemata, Creeley is almost frighteningly in control
(the influence of Olson etc?) and so on...there's the influence of hip hop
or skipping or nursery rhymes, internal rhyme...the calculated  omission of
a rhyme...but my understanding of the NFs is that they would toss out any
deviation from their norm of "correct" rhyme and regular metre. It seems
that for them its a way away from the seemingly dry and anti-romantic or
no-musical or unmellifluous Modernist and the Langpo stuff. They want to
aply a formula and then a great poem will result. But there are a million
ways. There are poets who simply write what comes into their heads and then
there are the more "deliberate" crafstman. There are many ways to attack the
poetic cat.
  They are maybe seeking that transcendent thing: there is an experiential
thing that hits us in such lines as Yeat's:  "As cold and passionate as the
dawn"...but that's been written, and just copying a fomula wont do it. Nor
do I think that Bernstein wants us to forget Yeats etc but we need to be
wary of these unmediators: they are just too charmingly uncomplex, they
"worry me"... to shorten this they want their "realist" AND poetical
transcendent cake and they want to eat it and eat it until they die from
having it and not knowing why they started eating. They drown in a flood of
cliches and fomulas...ulimately their work will fail either to teach or give
any one any kind of "buzz".
 To be fair, some of the Langpo experiments verge on the side of dryness and
their dicta occasionally are or sound a bit humourless: but I find many
"epihanic" moments in eg Silliman. I remember one of his "sentence"
cluttered things where he makes observations (often very acute) of external
things, and also plays with "internal" conceptual things, some dry lines
intercede, and then there's something shockingly magical about the simple
observation of a gas station "glowing with light" ..something like
that...like Stanzas In Meditation much of the Langpo stuff delivers its
reward to those  who concentrate hard.hen there's some very funny stuff
like: " a bee the size of a cat"..dropped in at just the rught moment.
(Admittedly this [concentation on the poem] applies to all good lit. but a
lot of Langpo and its descendents, cousins etc, can seem "difficult" on
first encounter so that here such close attention is especially
relevant...but I dont feel it is thus "closed" or "elitist' ..one of the
charges levelled against it.its a matter of being persistent or being open
minded and maybe finding "ways in", being open minded as they say...)
  But I'd rather read "in The American tree" every day for the next three
hundred years than read one New Formalist poem.
 Preferably I like to see many styles, many contenders...Regards Richard
Taylor.

THE COURSES
With users in over a hundred countries and thousands of hits every day,
trAce is widely recognised as the most significant community of writers in
the world. Now it is taking the obvious next step and opening an Online
Writing School to bring together this huge resource of talent and match it
up with creative people who want to learn how to write on and for the web a=
s
well as for print. Based at The Nottingham Trent University, England, and
collaborating with The Hive enterprise centre, the trAce Online Writing
School is well-placed to make the most of its extensive international
connections with arts, business and new media. The School plans to fill its
virtual classrooms with students interested in learning what the web can do
for them and their writing, and they won't be disappointed - the tutors are
some of the best writers working on the internet today.

Writers like Talan Memmott, winner of this year's trAce/Alt-X New Media
Writing Prize with his intriguing site Lexia to Perplexia, offering
Hypertext and its Double, an advanced course in literary hypermedia.

And Canadian novelist Kate Pullinger, whose novels include The Last Time I
Saw Jane, Where Does Kissing End? and, most recently, Weird Sister, who wil=

Alan Sondheim, former Virtual Writer-in-Residence at trAce, offers
Cyberculture and Literature and is also host of the Common Workshop, a
shared meeting place where all students will meet to talk and exchange work=

Longtime contributor Arlen Humphries sends this in.  Arlen lives and
works in a "large, Eastern metropolis", his most recent book, possibly
the most important single work of English-language literature since
Lord Byron, is Optima Suavidad (Greenbean Press, NY, 1999, ISBN1-891408-

But I got a good feeling

really do.
Hello, Death,
Kiss my ass.

There aren't enough to go around

Hey, I said,
You look like a woman of superior breeding.
Would you like to do some with me?
I used to play second base for
the California Penal League.
I know what women really want.
A lot of attention.
Sometimes they call it stalking but
that's just to fool you.
Like those restraining orders.
Celine Dion must be stopped!


I'm listening to Rush Limbaugh telling me
what Senator Bob Kerry, who lost a leg,
thought in a firefight 32 years ago
and thinking,  "This is the guy who got out of the draft
for a boil on his ass."
Kerry publicly opposed
the war on his return, medals and all, while
Rush tried to break into radio.
So you tell me.
Looks like we have a real slow drive on I-5

Darling,
I don't know if it's the whiskey talking or
what but your facial hair doesn't bother me
nearly as much as it did about an hour ago.

Let's hinder someone's proposals
for global peace and sap their will to negotiate.

This was during the Tax Revolt of Ought-
One when thousands went to bed at night
not knowing if the deck would be ready for
the June regatta or where

I was sitting at my desk wondering why
people were writing songs of love,
but not for me.
In fact, the hole in her mouth was
no longer large enough to
encompass the torrent of abuse.
Anyway,
that's how I was raised and
it never affected me.

Pre-dating langpo -- and inspiring parts of it -- Ted Berrigan's Sonnets
come to mind.  I don't know if they do exactly what you're asking for here
(some of them come fairly close to the traditional quantitative
requirements) but, regardless, it's good, weird, funny shit (and by shit I
mean Shit) -- well worth at least a few afternoons of your life.  He may
not always be subverting the form with his form, but, as they say, these
still ain't your daddy's sonnets.

Oh, and conveniently Penguin Poets just published the lot of them in a book
-- appropriately, if unimaginatively -- called _The Sonnets_.

Lord, it is time.  Summer was very great.
All sweetly spoke to her of me
about your feet, so delicate, and yet double E!!
And high upon the Brooklyn Bridge alone,

loveliness that longs for butterfly!  There is no pad

3...What people say about the Creativity Workshop

"The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn their
dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how you can do
this through their challenging and inspiring creativity workshops...even a
simple first contact will prove what these two talented teachers can do for
your own gifts."
Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer, Professor, Singapore Management University.

"The Creativity Workshop in Spoleto has been a very special experience for
me. It opened up new ways to look at my work and I found new friendships. I
spent 15 fantastic days in an incredible place. Shelley and Alejandro are
superb teachers!"
Vera Eisenberg, painter, Argentina

"The Workshop was such a powerful experience for me, something I never
expected nor would I ever be able to repeat it."
Rolfe Werner, Engineer. Canberra, Australia.

"I found the workshop extremely valuable in generating awareness of my
creativity and in stimulating ideas."
Jeanne Arthur, Executive Officer, ACT Board of Secondary School Studies.
Canberra, Australia.

"I feel as though I now have a focus, a method, a way of evolving my ideas
and that the means are just as important as the end. I have created
environments just to create in, and environments just to display the work
in. My vision of attending to each detail, sound, smell, texture,
substance... is starting to find a home. Thanks for opening my eyes to
these essential aspects of creating through your guidance and example."
Student. University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

"This class was THE MOST enriching, enlightening, inspirational class I
have ever taken. The way I work and what I create will never be the same."
Student. University of Iowa, USA.

"Shelley and Alejandro's Creativity Workshop is amazing in that it breaks
down all your fears about thinking and writing. If it wasn't for them I
fear I never would have finished my master's thesis. I was blocked until I
took this course."
=46rancesca Salidu
PHD candidate in Shakespeare, University of Pisa. San Miniato, Italy.

"Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel taught their Creativity Workshop as
American Cultural Specialists under the United States Information Service
auspices. To say that they were extremely effective is a vast
understatement. I would unreservedly recommend their course. They have
abundant creativity, energy, and a wealth of skills."
Gloria Berbena, Asst. Cultural Attach=E9, US Information Service, US Embassy=
=2E
Rome, Italy.

"A special experience. Berc and Fogel opened us up to new and wonderful
ways of looking at our creativity."
Belkis Bottfeld, PHD, psychologist. Istanbul, Turkey.

"An unforgettable course!"
Gulnur Ayaz, MD. Istanbul, Turkey.

Under their guidance, participants explore their own creative processes
through different writing and drawing exercises. Berc and Fogel explain in
theory and demonstrate in practice the concepts of originality,
'appropriation', memory and imagination. They emphasize the intimate link
between personal and public spheres, individual and social practices,
history and myth, dream and reality. The focus of the workshop is on
process not product and to help participants find life-long tools of
creative expression.
Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have taught their Creativity Workshop
internationally. They have lectured on creativity and their own work at
universities and cultural centers throughout the world.
The Creativity Workshop is currently an intensive semester long course at
the International Writing Program of The University of Iowa.

Process not Product
The Creativity Workshop is for writers, painters, multimedia artists,
performers, teachers, business people and anyone interested in expanding
their creative potential. Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have developed a
series of exercises focused on developing the creative process.
Participants explore different artistic materials and mediums in order to
discover their particular and individual ways of expression and to be able
to break through the fears that inhibit creativity.

Tools for a Lifetime
The exercises used in the Creativity Workshop are intended to become the
tools for a lifetime of creative expression. Participants are encouraged to
draw from all kinds of resources of creativity -such as the oral tradition,
dreams, childhood memories, sense perceptions and intuition.
Working both individually and in collaborative groups, participants explore
their imaginative potential through exercises in writing, drawing, collage,
map making, story telling and guided visualization.

Blind Time


Mini-Retrospecitve of  Robert Morris


9 May - 16 June at Lance Fung Gallery, 537 Broadway, NYC


Reception for the artist:  Wednesday, 9 May, 6 - 8 PM



Blind Time is a mini-retrospective of drawings by Robert Morris which
began 28 years ago.  The reception for the artist opens on May 9th at
Lance Fung Gallery and will celebrate the gallery=EDs fifth anniversary.
Since the seminal Blind Time I drawing series initiated in 1973, Morris
has continued the task of re-defining drawing for himself with six
complete Blind Time series to date.  The most recent series was
completed in 2000.  Two drawings from each of the following series will
be presented:


Blind Time I,  1973


Morris discovered a new drawing technique; the process of working
blindfolded.  This method not only led between the Scylla of the
abstract and Charybdis of the ironic, but opened another space that was
at once conceptual and highly physical.  Working on a size that the
body could reach with outstretched arms and using only his hands
blackened with powdered graphite or graphite mixed with plate oil,
Morris set himself simple tasks involving varying pressures of rubbing,
estimated distances, opposed or inverse hand movements, mnemonic tests,
etc.


Blind Time II,  1976


In this series a woman blind from birth executed the drawings under
Morris=EDs supervision.


Blind Time III,  1985


While continuing to extend the production of the Blind Time works via a
priori physical tasks, a number of works in this series allude to the
physics of light, the cosmological, physiological aspects of the eye
and literal blindness.


Blind Time IV,  1991


Each work of this extensive series quotes the American language
philosopher Donald Davidson.  Revolving around issues of agency, event,
action, metaphor, etc., the Davidson excerpts resonate to the issues
implicit in Morris=ED investigations.


Blind Time V,  1999


The most personal, smallest in scale and fewest in number, these works
change materials (ink on plastic film rather than paper).  Morris works
over three pre-inscribed geometric elements that recall Durer=EDs famous
print.  The prominent textural elements recall biographical incidents
from the artist=EDs life.


Blind Time VI,  2000


Extending the range and scale of the materials used in series five,
these works elevate the linguistic element to a greater visual
prominence.  The format of the small textural notations that appear in
the first four series are here written in reverse and virtually
unreadable without a mirror.  These largely inaccessible reflections on
issues of mortality and innateness allow the enlarged caption/title of
each drawing to work against the graphic and plastic elements of the
drawing.

I reply:

I think we should call it "occasionalism," as I occasionally check my email,
and occasionally I reply to postings. Also, some of us bump into each other
occasionally at one place or another . . . and occasionally talk about poetry,
etc.

Ah, The Occasional Anthology! Perfect! We wouldn't even be trapped in a
timeline. We could publish occasionally . . .

Two upcoming West Coast events by Barrett Watten:

*****

The Grand Piano

A reading of a collaborative account of poetry and community
in San Francisco in the 1970s

Thursday, May 10, 2001, 7:30 PM
Small Press Traffic
Timken Lecture Hall, CCAC, 1111 8th St., San Francisco
(near intersection of 16th & Wisconsin)
Admission: $5, free to SPT members and CCAC students, faculty, and staff

*****

"The Turn to Language in the 1960s"

A talk sponsored by the Modernist and Avant-Garde Studies Group
and the Literature Department  Colloquium

Monday, 14 May 2001, 5 PM
Oakes Mural Room
University of California, Santa Cruz

This talk charts intersections between poetry--specifically, the
expressivist aesthetics of the New American poets as it moved in the
direction of language-centered writing--and the radical student /
countercultural movements in and around Berkeley in the 1960s. Examples
range from a comparison of the film Berkeley in the 60s with Ansel Adams'
administration-commissioned photodocumentary on the kind of rationalized
"multiversity" Clark Kerr wanted, to Allen Ginsberg's appearance at a 1965
Vietnam Day Committee march.  Watten follows the conflicts between rational
emancipation and poetic expression in a series of poets who passed through,
or emerged from, Berkeley in the 1960s.

All are invited.

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 05/04/2001 -- DirectGroup Bertelsmann
announces the acquisition of email marketer Zooba.com and the planned

wish to learn more about. Subscribers can choose from 48 topic areas and

email marketers and dot.com businesses, Zooba's platform provides compelling
content and access to related services and products," explained Markus
Wilhelm, BOOKSPAN CEO. "It is quite exciting to see what the Zooba team has
accomplished in a relatively short period of time. With its 2.5 million

works as a door opener: Book-loving Zooba subscribers will discover the
clubs to be the perfect media service for their special fields of interest.
The acquisition of Zooba will further fuel our determined efforts to fully
integrate the internet into our club businesses."

In addition to its core service, Zooba.com can provide each of its partners
with a custom content channel (emails personalized to fit the brand image of
the partner) in order to drive sales, acquire new customers, and retain
existing ones. "Until recently, publishers in particular have not had the
most efficient means to reach readers who are truly interested in their
books," commented Zooba President, Jeffrey Glass. "We are proud and
enthusiastic about the acquisition and will remain free to continue our
relationships with other publishing partners. The acquisition is a wonderful
event for our subscribers, investors, partners, and employees."

Poetry Night flap leaves boy even more averse to verse Father says
By Stacy St. Clair Daily Herald Staff Writer

A Naperville father saw no rhyme or reason for a principal to force his
son to attend a Poetry Night - and he filed a police report to prove it.

Glenn Mendoza asked authorities to charge Spring Brook Elementary
Principal Carl Pinnow with battery over the incident that occurred on
school grounds late last month.

The trouble began when Mendoza's 9-year-old son told his parents he did
not want to go to Poetry Night, an after-hours program students are not
required to attend. His parents sent the boy's teacher a note saying he
would not participate in the April 26 event.

"It's not his bag," his father said. "We didn't think it would be
detrimental to his academic career if he didn't go to Poetry Night."

As Poetry Night festivities were beginning, Mendoza's son asked his
parents' permission to go to the school playground less than a block
away. Twenty minutes later, he returned home crying and shaking.

While at the school, the boy told his parents the principal came out and
asked him why he was not attending Poetry Night. Mendoza said his son
responded he didn't like poetry.

Pinnow, apparently unhappy with the response, ushered the boy into the
school. Police said both sides agree Pinnow touched the boy while
escorting him into the building but differ on the amount of force that
was used.

The Mendoza family contends Pinnow grabbed his son by the arm and pulled
him inside; the principal told authorities he gently guided the boy into
school.

The principal took the boy to the boiler room to store his bicycle,
police said. Once there, Pinnow began questioning the boy about why he
wasn't at Poetry Night.

When the third-grader said his parents had excused him, Pinnow left the
boy alone in the boiler room and went to consult the teacher. Police
said both versions of events also differ on whether the principal closed
the door while interrogating the boy and checking with the teacher.

After the teacher verified the boy's account, Mendoza said Pinnow
lectured his son about the importance of poetry. The principal released
the boy around 7:20 p.m., according to his father.

"He came home crying and shaking," Mendoza said. "The kid was totally
distraught."

Naperville police still were processing the report Friday. The
department will forward it to the Will County state's attorney office if
Mendoza demands it, but Capt. Paul Shafer said it was highly unlikely he
would recommend charges.

"I doubt very much I am going to find criminal intent," Shafer said.

Pinnow has the authority to handle matters in his school as long as he
does not break any laws. Barring that, any questions about how he
handled the situation should be managed by the school district, Shafer
said.

The school district conducted - and has concluded - its own
investigation. Indian Prairie Unit District 204 Superintendent Gail
McKinzie said she was not in a position to second-guess Pinnow's
handling of the situation.

"From my perspective, he was doing what he saw best," she said.

Pinnow could not be reached for comment.

Though tensions remain between Pinnow and Mendoza, the principal met
with the boy to assure him the dispute between the adults would not be
held against him.

"Our interest is in the student," McKinzie said. "Mr. Pinnow handled the
situation appropriately by following up with the student to make sure he
was comfortable in school."

Meetings with the boys' parents, however, have been less than
successful. The two sides have spoken several times without reaching a
consensus.

Mendoza - who moved to Naperville nine months ago so his children could
attend District 204 schools - says he will push for criminal charges
because doesn't want Pinnow to treat another student in such a manner.

He also intends to ask the school board to discuss the matter with him
in a closed-door meeting.

"I don't want this guy's head," Mendoza said. "My kids are young, and
they will be in the district for a long time. I don't want to be known
as that 'Crazy Mendoza dad.' I'm just trying to make sure this doesn't
happen again."

Regardless of the outcome, Pinnow's attempt to instill a love of poetry
in the third-grader appears to have backfired.

"If he did that to make poetry important to my son," Mendoza says, "it
really wasn't a good motivator."

Yes, Stephen is one of us -- a New Jersey poet. He is in my anthology of NJ
poets, Bluestone & salt Hay (Rutgers U Press/1990) and had contact with him
back then. He was kind enough to get Norton to wave royalties on the poems I
used & read at a number of events I sponsored around the anthology.

He is something of a poetry "macher" in NJ, as he is often consulted for
grants & the like and at one point was involved in training writers for the
state's poetry-in-the schools program. He'll probably be our next poet
laureate (I position I helped birth and which Gerald Stern is currently the
man)

When I spoke to him a few years back, he noted that after an appearence on
NPR's Fresh Air, his sales began taking off. I think this marks the moment
he went from a Norman Dubie-type making the rounds at MFA programs to a
mainstream guy who is filling in the spot of Suburban Poet Laureate once
held by Daniel Halpern

Come in from the heat and join us for another round of California

Stork Club.

Poets Greg Brooker and Cheryl Burket will read

2330 Telegraph is correct.)

Greg will be reading from "Spirit's Measure" (just out from Second
Story Books), a poem incorporating the same hat and seer stone method of
translation that Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon church, used to
"translate" The Book of Mormon.  His poems have appeared in
Proliferation, LIT, 6,500, The Iowa Review, Big
Allis and others.  He lives in Los Angeles.

Cheryl Burket is a poet living in San Francisco. Recent work has appeared in
Tinfish, San Francisco Bay Guardian, First intensity, Mirage/Periodical,
Attic Magazine, Fourteen Hills, and others. Her chapbook 'behind the
white' was published by

  BUSH ADMINSTRATION'S JUDICIAL NOMINEES TAKE FAR-RIGHT SLANT
________________________________________________________________

ACTION: FIND OUT ABOUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S RIGHT-WING
JUDICIAL NOMINEES

The Bush administration has announced its first eleven federal
judicial nominees this afternoon.  The group includes judges
and lawyers with close ties to the Federalist Society, Justice
Antonin Scalia and far-right Senators Strom Thurmond and Jesse
Helms.  Among the nominees are conservative lawyers who have
argued before the Supreme Court in favor of private school
vouchers, cutting back the separation of church and state and
exempting states from federal lawsuits designed to protect the
disabled.

People For the American Way is conducting its own analysis of
the nominees and will make recommendations to the Senate soon.
A few facts about the first slate of nominees and our
principles for confirmation are listed below.

PLEASE REVIEW THEM AND PREPARE TO TAKE ACTION!
________________________________________________________________

               *** THE FIRST ELEVEN NOMINEES ***

All eleven nominations are to seats on federal circuit courts
of appeal.  Because the Supreme Court accepts a very limited
number of cases each year, the federal appeals courts often have
the final word on your rights and liberties.  These appointments
are extremely important!

Take special note of the home state and states covered by the
circuit court of appeals for each nominee.  Senators from the
nominee's home state and the states represented in a particular
circuit must be reminded that their constituents will be directly
affected by these jurists, potentially for decades to come.

Terrence Boyle (NC)
Nominated to the 4th Circuit (MD, NC, SC, WV and VA)
Former aide to Senator Jesse Helms.

Edith Brown Clement (LA)
Nominated to the 5th Circuit (LA, MS and TX)
District Judge in Louisiana.

Deborah L. Cook (OH)
Nominated to the 6th Circuit (KY, MI, OH and TN)
Member of the Federalist Society and Ohio Supreme Court Justice.

Miguel A. Estrada (DC)
Nominated to the D.C. Circuit (D.C.)
Law partner of Ted Olson, who argued the Bush campaign's case
before the Supreme Court and has been nominated as Solicitor
General.

Michael W. McConnell (UT)
Nominated to the 10th Circuit (CO, KS, NM, UT and WY)
Argued before the Supreme Court that government should be able
to freely fund religious institutions.

Priscilla Owen (TX)
Nominated to the 5th Circuit
Conservative Texas Supreme Court Justice.

John G. Roberts, Jr. (DC)
Nominated to the D.C. Circuit
Former deputy solicitor general under Kenneth Starr.

Dennis Shedd (SC)
Nominated to the 4th Circuit
Former aide to Senator Strom Thurmond.

Jeffrey Sutton (DC)
Nominated to the 6th Circuit
Argued successfully before the Supreme Court that states should
not be subject to certain lawsuits brought under federal laws
that protect the disabled from discrimination.

Roger L. Gregory (VA)
Re-nominated to the 4th Circuit
Previously nominated and temporarily appointed by President
Clinton to the 4th Circuit.

Barrington Parker, Jr. (NY)
Nominated to the 2nd Circuit (CT, NY and VT)
Appointed to the federal district court by President Clinton.
________________________________________________________________

  *** PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDICIAL NOMINEES ***

1) No nominee is presumptively entitled to confirmation.
Because these appointments are for life, and because the Senate
has a Constitutionally mandated role in this process, the
nominee bears the burden of establishing that he or she meets
the criteria that are appropriately applied to nominees to these
esteemed positions.  The mere absence of disqualifying evidence
in a nominee's record should not constitute sufficient grounds
for confirmation.

2) In considering these nominees, the Senate should confirm
only those who:

    A) have an exemplary record in the law;

    B) bring an open mind to decision-making, with an
       understanding of the real-world consequences of their
       decisions;

    C) demonstrate a commitment to protecting the rights of
       ordinary Americans and do not place the interests of the
       powerful over those of individual citizens;

    D) have fulfilled their professional obligation to work on
       behalf of the disadvantaged;

    E) have a record of commitment to the progress made on
       civil rights, women's rights and individual liberties;

    F) manifest a respect for the constitutional role Congress
       plays in promoting these rights and health and safety
       protections, and ensuring recourse when these rights are
       breached.

Bank that is being held in Hawai'i. The Asian Development Bank had
originally planned to meet in Seattle. But after the WTO protests, it
moved to Honolulu. It was felt that Honolulu would be the ideal place
because it would be hard to mobilize protesters.

Last year the ADB met in Thailand. 2,000 people demonstrated.

The city of Honolulu has been gearing up for 10 months. One news report
said that 5-7 million were spent. Another said _only_ 4 million. Lots of
new riot control gear was acquired.

The ADB met in Honolulu's new convention center. Honolulu's convention
center cost the tax payers many dollars. It has been a huge financial
failure. In the years since I've lived here, I think only the dentists
have come. Basically the convention center sits empty.

It was projected that more than 3,000 people would come and protest.
There were a lot of worries that people from "outside" would come and
agitate. Lots of laws were passed that restricted people's freedoms.

Cayetano, our governor who always knows how to manipulate prejudice for
his own good: "We don't expect some of these crazy people from the
mainland to come here — the Ruckus groups and all of that — just to
start trouble, if they do, we'll be ready for them."

Before the protest, the convention center was surrounded by a double
barricade. One of plastic things filled with water. One of metal
barricades. Inside that barricade was the first line of police. They had
on aloha shirts and leis. I asked a policeman who gave them the leis and
he said the city did. He offered me his but I said no thanks. Next there
was a line of ADB security. The stretched around the entire building.
Many of them were members of the UH football team. Some were paid $10 an
hour. Some had volunteered. They had on pith helmets and vests made out
of a cloth that looked like tapa cloth. Several had on, as is said on
the continent, sarongs. Inside the convention center (the walls are
glass) there were police up and down the elevator.

Most of the buildings around the convention center had boarded up their
windows. Along the route of the protest someone had put up a "Save
Rock-Za" sign. Rock-za is a strip club across from the convention
center.

600 showed up today to protest. We walked from Ala Moana park to the
convention center. We were escorted by police on bikes. They walked
their bikes alongside us.

There was a large Hawaiian presence which was great to see (although the
news said that "they" were not protesting about poverty and
globalization but about Hawaiian rights as if these things are
unrelated). Many conch shells were blown. There were many Hawaiian flags
flown upside down.

Also great: many older people were out.

There was no threat of violence. There was much talk of "peaceful"
protest (the merging in Hawai'i between "peaceful protest" and "civil
disobedience" is something that I think has been very damaging for
activist organizations here) and how it helped get the message across
(something that I think is empirically untrue; I believe there was no
national coverage of this peaceful protest).

My favorite image...the ballrooms in the convention center are named
Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II. The names are written above the doors in
metal type. When the convention center was first opened it was pointed
out that the Kamehameha had been misspelled or mismarked. This was
corrected at great expense. The ADB had put metal letters over top the
Kamehameha letters that said "global pavilion." These letters were three
times the size of the Kamehameha letters.

Another sad story: Bumpy Kanahele, a sovereignty activist, was
approached by the ADB to be a part of their manipulations. He spoke out
at various meetings in defense of the restrictive laws against protest
that the city was passing in the 10 months before the ADB. He said as
long as these laws were used against outsiders, he was ok with them (he
seems strangely naive about the workings of the law for someone who has
been in jail for protesting). He also said that people shouldn't come
here and use Hawai'i for their own protests. Bumpy was inside the ADB.
Rumor has it that he was part of security or was asked to be part of
security or something like that. A guy outside the ADB had on a "Free
Bumpy" t-shirt from the days when he was in jail.

At one point, Tadao Chino, president of the ADB, came out to talk to
protesters. Walden Bello, among others, had a statement ready for him.
Chino left before they finished the statement.

After standing in front of the convention center (no attempt to shut it
down happened), the march continued through Waikiki. Many tourists took
pictures of it. The police in bikes walked beside us. There were many
undercover cops. Many were carrying cameras. My favorite was a guy in an
aloha shirt carrying a beach mat.

We stopped at statues of King Kalakaua and Duke Kahanamoku as we walked
through Waikiki. Homage was paid. More conch shells were blown. Several
Hawaiians chanted protest chants.

Each side street in Waikiki had around 15-20 cops blocking it off.

The paper says that there were two cops for each protester today.

The Honolulu police chief says that the money spent was well spent.

I am writing this as a poet to a poetry list because I think that going
to the ADB protest is part of the job description of being a poet.

1. BROOKLYN PARTY

Brendan Lorber & Tracey McTague
insist that you come to the
garden party & slide show
*** Saturday 19 May beginning at Dusk ***
in The Mothership
perched atop the highest point in NYC
elevation 316' above sea level
316 23rd Street Brooklyn

Party begins at sundown.
You will not want to leave.
There will be ouzo, colorful slides
of Greek Islands & Airplane Mishaps,
there will be engaging conversation,
merriment unto debauch, non-standardized tests
traditional Greek food & behavior,
strange portents & signs from on high.

Bring something to share: ie, a drink
or your charming & infectious joi de vivre.
Other than that, it's free.
You may also bring friends.

How to get there:

316 23rd Street is between 6th & 7th Avenues
Across from a vast cemetery which, if you arrive
early enough or stay very late, will be open for strolling.

F to 15th Street/Prospect Park West stop.
Exit at Windsor & 16th Street portal.
Walk down Windsor Street to 7th Avenue
Turn left/west and walk towards.
23rd street -- mothership entrance...
316 23rd Street between 6th & 7th Avenues
across from "Best" angel in cemetery.

N or R to 25th Street stop.
Walk up 25th street from 4th avenue to
Green Wood Cemetery.
Follow the circumference to
316 23rd Street between 6th & 7th Avenues.

There is often a helicopter hovering
over the house which makes it easy
to spot, but as a backup you might
want to mapquest it: www.mapquest.com

or try your luck with this heavily encrypted,
seemingly dubious, yet occasionally effective link
(sometimes it shows you a map of the mothership's
locale & sometimes it just shows you a map of the u.s.):

A lovely sonnet, Patrick. I like especially the second stanza,
though it's the final couplet that really nails it.

Has any one read the huge book by Perec described by Marjorie Perloff
in"Radical Articfice?" It something like: "Life: a User's manual" (in
French)...I like the idea of it...based on the Knight's tour in chess (with
one square missing) (which mysterious square is never arrived at!)(very
Carolingian!(Lewis)) and the useless jig-saws that dissolve or magically
"grow" into larger and larger connections while each fragment
vanishes...very Rousellian...(Raymond). In that chapter there is an
interesting discussion or peroration on this very subject. Oulippo, the NFs
and old Zukovsky are mentioned in despatches...and an example of J A
parodying a "formal" rhymed poem. Richard von Sturmer (NZ-North US) is a big
enthusiast of the Oulippo people...I also know a guy who wrote a series of
poems without the letter "a" (or with the only vowel being "a") etc..but the
point, if there is one, of leaving out the "e" is that it lines up with the
concept of mystery and disappearance and so on...One Oulippean warns against
using etc...so ..well..poor old Vonnegut! And so on and and so on and
etcetera and and etcetera etcetera etcetera ...and etceteretara...he wants
vast and seemingly unending detail....Cheers, Richard.

Of course he was a Capitalist. Capitalists have to have hobbies! Anycase
that's  a bit unfair...its how one thinks and why, that counts,(sorry about
the pun), not one's bank balance. "Capitalists make the best Communists".

Ron. Could you work (or have worked) eg in Tjanting without a formal
principle like the Fibonnacci? What is the state of your current project?
Speak into the microphone: "Speak louder!"..."Speak softer!"...Sorry, my
stupid jokes....
Actually I am a major fan of Tjanting...I can open it up at any place and it
is hypnotic: an extraordinary work....Mind you, it depends on my mood
etc.... What letter are you up to? Do you have a new "project"?  I've got
the "Baldessari edition" (second printing). "Lit" 's good too. and I very
much got into "Paradise". Compared notes onthat with Wystan Curnow. He's a
great "projector". Any way...Good on you. Regards, Richard.

IF THIS IS JUST A HEAD TRIP, HOW COME THEY STOLE MY LUGGAGE?
A presentation by members of the Poet to Poet/Medicinal Purposes Literary
Review staff on behalf of The Poetry Event Schedule. Featured readers
include Robert Dunn, Thomas M. Catterson, Leigh Harrison, Anthony
Scarpantonio, Jacqueline Annette, and Evie Ivy. Poet to Poet is an
organization that promotes literary endeavors in the New York metropolitan
area and beyond, through open mikes, recitals, the "Poet to Poet" cable
television show, the Medicinal Purposes Literary Review, and the monthly
Poetry Event Schedule.

LUISA GUIGLIANO AND DAVID KIRSCHENBAUM
Luisa Giugliano's chapbook, Chapter in the Dayfinch Journal, is available
from Cuneiform Press. Her most recent translations of the medieval Italian
poet Lu Zsi appeared in the book Doubleaught (Chronoplastics Press). Poet
and publisher David Kirschenbaum is the power behind Boog Literature, a
publishing venture that has turned out more than one hundred zines,
chapbooks and broadsides during the past decade. His work has recently
appeared online at CanWeHaveOurBallBack.com and The Brooklyn Review Online.

"DEEPI-TALKI": THE GRIOT'S POETICS
A WORKSHOP TAUGHT BY LORENZO THOMAS
[See bio for May 16th reading.] Looking at what Henry Louis Gates, Jr. calls
Signifyin(g) and what Stephen E. Henderson termed mascons in Black poetry,
this workshop will connect these concepts to aspects of African folktales
and oral poetry as well as works by Aime Cesaire, Melvin B. Tolson, and
Amiri Baraka. The class includes discussion and practice in how to use these
techniques.
These workshops have been made possible by a generous grant from the Jerome
Foundation.

Wednesday, May 16th at 8 pm
ED FRIEDMAN AND LORENZO THOMAS
Since 1987, Ed Friedman has served as Artistic Director of The Poetry
Project. His titles include Mao & Matisse, and three 2001 publications: Away
(Granary Books) Drive Through Blue Cylinders (Hanging Loose Press), and The
Funeral Journal (Jensen/Daniels). Writes Murat Nemet-Nejat, "Mao & Matisse
is exquisitely attuned to this historical moment. Its texture embodies the
cultural minutiae of its time and its issues." Lorenzo Thomas, a member of
the Umbra workshop in the 1960s, is a widely published poet and critic whose
works have appeared in many journals including African American Review,
Arrowsmith, Blues Unlimited, Partisan Review, and Ploughshares. In his most
recent book, Extraordinary Measures: Afrocentric Modernism and 20th-Century
American Poetry (University of Alabama Press), Mr. Thomas reassesses the
development of African American poetry within the context of modernism and
the troubled racial history of the United States. His collection of poems,
Chances Are Few, is "fresh, individual, and alive. ... an excellent book,"
writes Stephen Stephanchev, author of American Poetry Since 1945.

Friday, May 18th at 10:30 pm
FUNDAMENTALIST PROPHECY, HOMOEROTICISM, AND CANDLES
Our beloved Friday night coordinator Regie Cabico is celebrating his
birthday in Late Night Reading Series Style! Things are going to get campy,
as Regie becomes for one night only the (female?) cabaret singer he's always
wanted to be. Performers include spoken word performance ensemble
Shakespeare's Monkey and poets Henry Flesh and Lex Lonehood.

*  *  *

Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $7, $4 for students and
seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members. Schedule is subject to change.
The Poetry Project, located in St. Mark's Church at the corner of 2nd Avenue
and 10th Street in Manhattan, is wheelchair accessible with assistance and

I have begun working on an article on Hilda Morley.  As many of you know,
Morley is--to say the least--understudied.  I have been able to locate one
article, several brief tributes, and a number of obituaries.  If anyone has
any more information, or knows of any dissertations or unpublished articles,
please let me know by contacting me by e-mail.  Thanks very much!

I must admit that I find this news very depressing,
but also strangely inspIring: is it not at least
curious that repressive regimes always instinctively
fear  poetry?
Would people on this list be interested in drafting
some sort of open letter in defence of our Arab
comrades' right to free access to their own
imaginations?

>
>  By Jalal Bana and Ori Nir
>
>
> The Shin Bet has been hauling in Israeli Arab

>

> confirms writers have been questioned because of
> "extremist-nationalist"

> there has not been such
> an intensive campaign against them since the 1980s,
> during the first
> Intifada when the government worried that writing it
> regarded as
> "incitement" would pull the Palestinian violence in

>
> In the last month, Shin Bet has questioned the three
> publishers of Saut al
> Halk u'al-Huriya, published by the northern faction
> of the Islamic
> movement, poet-columnist Abdel Hakim Masalha, and
> veteran journalist
> Muhamad Ali Taha.
>
> Taha, chairman of the Israeli Arab Writers Union,

> Israeli Arab Monitoring Committee to serve as the
> head of the Naqba

> Palestinian nationalist
> affairs.  A month ago, while hosting his friend
> former justice minister
> Yossi Beilin, he was served a warrant ordering him
> to appear at the Misgav
> police station.
>
> There, he was questioned by two Shin Bet officers
> who identified themselves
> as Yarden and Yaniv.  They questioned him mostly
> about his contacts with
> people in the Palestinian Authority and his role
> organizing a joint rally
> by Israeli Arab and Palestinian intellectuals last
> March.
>
> Taha said that Yarden told him he was forbidden to
> enter PA-controlled
> areas, and warned him about incitement in his
> articles and speeches.
> According to Taha, his interrogators also demanded
> that he "be careful" in
> his writing because of its impact on the Israeli
> Arab community.  The
> interrogators, said Taha, told him they "know
> everything" about him and
> that they have "a large file" on him.  They quoted
> from his poetry and
> other publications.  "They did a doctorate on my my
> writing before calling
> me in," says Taha, but he adds that he's known more
> difficult times.  In
> the mid-'80s, a book of his poetry was banned, since
> the authorities
> claimed it was incitement.  It eventually came out
> due to pressure from
> human rights organizations and Jewish intellectuals.
>
> But it's not only famous, veteran writers whose work

> the Shin Bet.  Abdel Hakim Masalha from Kfar Kara,
> who makes his living
> selling ads in the local Arabic-language press and
> as a newspaper
> distributor, took up poetry after the start of the
> October riots, which lit
> a warning lamp at the Shin Bet.
>
> Forty years old, he was questioned last week in the
> Hadera police station.
> "A Shin Bet interrogator told me 'your poetry is
> dangerous' and they told
> me 'we're following everything you write.'" They
> told him to tone down his
> writing because "readers, especially the young among
> them, could understand
> the writing as incitement."
>
> Masalha began writing after the start of the
> rioting, and he usually
> eulogizes the fallen, describing their mothers'
> suffering.  His two best
> known poems are about Asil Asala, the high schooler
> killed during rioting
> in Arabe, presumably by Border Patrol bullets, and
> Muhamad al-Dura, the
> youngster shot dead in his father's arms during a
> fire fight at the Erez
> junction early in the Intifada.  In other poems
> Masalha mentions the Sabra
> and Chatilla massacres and anti-Arab rhetoric of
> Shas Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
>
> The Prime Minister's Office said that Masalha was
> indeed questioned on May
> 2, "about nationalist poetry published in Saut al
> Halk."  That paper's
> publishers have also been questioned.  One, Ali
> Salah, was questioned two
> months ago in the Beit Shean police station when he
> returned from a
> business trip to Jordan.  Some CDs of Islamic music
> were confiscated, and
> later returned.  A month ago he was called in again
> by the Shin Bet and
> questioned for four hours, he says.
>
> The questioning was mostly about his contacts with

> trips to Jordan, Europe and
> the PA. Salah owns an advertising agency and is a
> singer in a band.  He
> says his trips were only for business purposes.
>

Dear Poetics List Folks,

I am looking for recordings of Robert Duncan's lectures, readings, and
interviews for my ongoing work toward a biography of Duncan (due out from
UCal Press next year).   There are a number of people who have volunteered
to help me in transcribing and transferring these tapes to more stable
formats.  I would greatly appreciate help in locating these RD resources and
I am particularly interested in locating recordings of classes that RD
taught at New College and elsewhere.

I also have a Robert Duncan website up at
members.nbci.com/subpress/robertduncan.htm.

Thanks,
Lisa Jarnot

Hello Everyone,

Thanks to all who ordered a copy of Jordan Davis's Yeah, No. I'm
putting everyone's copy into the mail today.

I also have, fresh from the printer, copies of Drew Garder's Student
Studies. They're available from SPD, or direct from me, postage paid.

If you order from me, please make the check out to Gary Sullivan and
send to me at: 558 - 11th Street, #1B, Brooklyn, NY  11215.

I've just been informed that my Columbia email account (this account)
is expiring in two days! And I'm leaving town for a week tomorrow,
and won't be able to pick up my email from this account -- ever
again! So please please please do not write me back at this address.
Send all future email correspondence to me at: readmemag@excite.com

Many kind thanks. A brief catalog description of Drew's book follows.

Gary


Drew Gardner
_Student Studies_
No ISBN, $6.00
In these five longer poems, the blurry figure of the lyric being
clambers through an unsteady landscape of shifting and turbulent
elements. Jump-cutting urban observation "at the top of Union Square /
a crowd is looting a dumpster / full of S & M gear", social protest
"the IMF, CIA, FBI, GE, Lockheed Martin, Texaco ... / Bill Clinton
works for them", emotional declarations "to love is by eyes by ears /
beautiful crystal falling from presence", daily experience "bright
glare of light from the station wagon's paint job", and cosmic events
"the alarm transmission / is the whole earth spinning", Gardner holds
the poems together with the lynchpin of a singular integrity. Gardner,
a musician, loads the poems with his flexible sonic sensibility. More
dramatic than much recent writing, the poems offer an alternative
world in which "your attention becomes the agency of creation." Detour
24 pp. 2001.

John Crouse & Kimberly Lyons


John Crouse is one of those writers who are taking prose narrative to a
place it's never begun to think about. Reading his books you trip, stumble
and
fall like babies on an experimental drug. The knotted sentences, the
simultaneously shifting tenses, come to resemble a scout's game of cat's
cradle, the
strings all magically coming free at the very end with one tug. His
manifesto might be paraphrased as follows, "how to resurrect to commune/ a
past's
tongue so the past's not dead/so it can be translated/presently so what's
passed isn't." Crouse is the author of Eventing (Potes & Poets,1999). An
excerpt from his new book Headlines appears in our spring newsletter; the
entirety will be out soon from O Books.


People talk about Kimberly Lyons the way they used to talk about Laura
Nyro and Patti Smith, as though you have to be from New York to fully
appreciate their work, the anarchic spirit, the wistful tender underbelly,
the endless search for perfection in life and love. Like Bette Davis in "A
Stolen
Life", Lyons' poetry wears two faces, first the microfocus on the intimate
details of a woman's daily life, and secondly the humming supersonic
whistle
of metropolitan Rosetta wailing wall, the 200 languages you hear on the
midtown bus. Formerly the director of the Poetry Project at St. Marks in
New
York, Kimberly Lyons is the author of Promises (1996), Mettle (artist's
book, with Ed Eppling), and Abracadabra (Granary,1999).

THE EXEGESIS OF THE DREAM


It is the recapitulation of the relating of the experience and not the
experiencing of the experience itself that validates.

The content of the dream, being part of the process of the experience and
not
part of the process of the recapitulation of the relating of the
experience,
has no worth and is never described in detail.

------------------------------------------------------

The dreamstate is dysphasic

The dreamer speaks of the dream with precision, an engineer sketching a
schematic, every aspect exact and quantifiable, as if dreamscapes
possessed
measurable dimension.

The dreamstate is dissilient

The dreamer speaks of the dream with shame, constrained by the need of
confession to address a secret wellspring of disgrace given shape by the
act
of dreaming, as if the dreamscape could be more than mere veniality.

The dreamstate is droll

The dreamer speaks of the dream in the flat empty tones of the defeated,
as
reportage of a catastrophe lived through but not survived, as if
transisting
between the dreamscape and waking had a capacity for injury irreparable in
reality.

The dreamstate is dynamic

The dreamer speaks of the dream drowsily in language leavened with a vast
lassitude as if the dreamscape were the final leg of a sojourn begun in
hope,
ending in exhausted indifference.

The dreamstate is delusory

The dreamer speaks of the dream as a tourist, the dreamscape an alternate
country in which the attractions and the prisons both offer only the most
limited possibilities of escape.

The dreamscape is dysphoric

The dreamer speaks of the dream as a state of grace.

STEFANIA PANDOLFO & LESLIE SCALAPINO

Thursday May 17, 7:30 pm
$5 donation
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Anthropologist STEFANIA PANDOLFO's extraordinary first book Impasse of the
Angels (University of Chicago Press, 1997) is subtitled "Scenes from a
Moroccan Space of Memory," and is a truly remarkable cultural work of
daring and rare imagination.  Her dense, elaborated writing stands out as
singular in its effort to "let real characters take center stage and,
through their act of speech, invent a people rather than stand for it."
The book is rich with the poetry and philosophy both native to Morocco's
Berber cultures and drawn from classic Islam.  Instead of using poetry,
though, as example or instance of culture, she lets its methods shape and
orient her in her writing.  Ms. Pandolfo teaches anthropology at UC
Berkeley.

LESLIE SCALAPINO is the author of more than 15 books of poetry and prose.
Her most recent book, R-hu (Atelos. 2000), she has characterized as
"thought intending to dismantle mythos, lineage--an undertaking of joy."
Her work in general has relentlessly explored "the radical nature of
experience"--title phrase from one piece in The Public World/Syntactically
Impermanence (Wesleyan, 1999)--via a radical fusion of poetry, critical
thinking, philosophic conjecture, and the active breakdown of received
categories of hierarchy in thought and writing.  As editor and publisher of
O Books, Ms. Scalapino has brought into print over 100 works of
contemporary poetry.  She lives in Oakland.

Subject:      _Parataxis_ 10 & _Tending the vortex_
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Thought I'd post a note about a couple things that turned up in the mail
this morning.  Listmembers here may have come across _Parataxis_, a magazine
edited by Drew Milne that was one of the best little magazines of the 1990s;
its last (double) issue came out in 1996, so it's great to see that Drew's
at last revived the journal.  #10 is 108pp, perfectbound; it has poetry from
Andrea Brady, Clark Coolidge, Peter Middleton, John Wilkinson, Stacy Doris,
Ian Hunt, Keston Sutherland, Dell Olsen, Chris Emery & John Tranter.  But
the heart of the issue is its characteristically large & stimulating section
of essays.  Peter Nicholls writes on Swinburne & his influence on Pound &
Eliot; Peter Middleton writes on Charles Olson as a "would-be historian"
(the phrase is drawn from Olson's comment, "I would be an historian"); Milne
himself writes on JH Prynne's _Poems_; Will Montgomery writes on Susan Howe
& the sacred; & there's a short talk on Jennifer Moxley's "parallactic"
poetry by Rod Mengham. -- The curious can write Drew Milne for a copy at
agm@cam.ac.uk -- copies are 5 pounds.  Or they're obtainable from Peter
Riley (Books) at priley@dircon.co.uk .  In terms of poetry periodicals
oriented towards criticism, _Parataxis_ is one of the best around--good to
see it back.

The other item I got was _Tending the vortex: the works of Brian Catling_.
Catling's hard to pin down: visual artist, sculptor, poet, prose-writer,
performance artist.  Readers of Iain Sinclair's novels & nonfiction will
know him (he pops up in the novels as "Joblard" if I remember rightly).  His
best poem is probably the long prose-poem _The Stumbling Block its Index_,
which was published in a very limited edition but is reprinted in the
anthologies _Conductors of Chaos_ & Keith Tuma's _Anthology of 20th-century
British & Irish Poetry_.  Anyway, _Tending the vortex_ collects a couple
interviews, virtually all the criticism previously published on Catling's
work, several new essays by Allen Fisher, Simon Perril, et al, images from
his recent video work, & a bundle of previously uncollected texts.  The book
hasn't got a price on it.  Again you can get it through Peter Riley (Books),
I believe, or you could write the editor, Simon Perril:
simonperril@yahoo.co.uk

Subject:      Help The Baffler
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Dear Poets,

As poetry editor for The Baffler I was devastated to receive the following
news. The Baffler has supported many poets and fiction writers; it is also
the only magazine I've ever been associated with that actually pays their
poets.

The only good news in all this is that the issue they were working
on--featuring poems by Elizabeth Willis, Mark McMorris, Michael Gizzi, Lee
Ann Brown, and David Hess--had already gone to the printer when the fire
struck.

Anything any of you could do to help them now would be greatly appreciated.

-Jennifer Moxley
(Jennifer.Moxley@maine.edu)


Dear Friend of The Baffler:

On the morning of April 25th, our office and the unique building in which
it was housed were destroyed in a fire. In addition to the Baffler office,
the building was home to a close community of artists, writers, nonprofit
organizations, and small businesses. No one was injured in the fire, but
the physical damage was extensive. Worse, however, was the devastation of a
vital center of cultural activity.

We're struggling to cope with our losses and those of our friends. We have
set up a temporary office and will do our best to publish Baffler #14
(which was sent to the printer a week before the fire) as scheduled. It now
appears that our subscriber list is recoverable, so we are hopeful that
everyone will get their copy of the magazine. For now, though, we have no
computers, no contact lists, no rolodexes, no desks, and no desk lamps.

We and our friends are determined to rebuild and recover, but we need help.
For those who can, please send donations made out to The Baffler Recovery
Fund to:

The Baffler Magazine
P. O. Box 378293
Chicago, IL 60637

Donations are tax-deductible.

In-kind help would also be greatly appreciated. We're hoping we can score a
few iMacs mothballed in the warehouses of northern California after the
dot-com bankruptcies of recent months. Or, on the humbler, more second-wave
side, just some file cabinets, or desks, or carpets, or one of those huge
unabridged dictionaries. Let us know if you can help with any of these.
And, as our e-mail lists are incomplete, please forward this message to
anyone you know who would be interested.

Thanks to everyone who has called in sympathy.

Emily Vogt

Dave Mulcahey

P.S. Funds are also being set up for our friends. Information on those
funds will be posted on our Web site shortly.

Bertolt Brecht's STORIES OF MR. KEUNER will soon be shipping from City

Poet, playwright, and theoretician, Brecht also wrote prose fiction (his
collected short stories are available again). The Keuner stories fall
somewhere between fiction and veiled autobiography.

City Lights is publishing the first English-language edition of STORIES

Two excerpts:

Success

Mr. K. saw an actress walking by and said: "She's beautiful." His
companion said: "She's recently become successful because she's
beautiful." Mr. K. was annoyed and said: "She's beautiful because she's
become successful."


[An aristocratic stance]

Mr. Keuner said: "I, too, once adopted an aristocratic stance (you know:
erect, upright, and proud, head thrown back). I was standing in rising
water at the time. I adopted this stance when it rose to my chin."

walking down the street, turning the corner, slipping from your reach.
The lights blink during a brownout in summer, and you think _it's him_.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

I can't imagine there is more than one English translation floating
around... but if you have it, turn to page 231

I remember when I got to this page as I read the book, in the middle of
this "odd" typewritten list, in the middle of a book following all sorts
of "odd" conventions on its own...

now look at the diagonal of Gs (lowercase) that makes its way down and
through the page. like I said, very random, or not. I think this might
have been the "oddest" moment for me in reading the book. Somehow
reminded me of all those site-specific earth artists, the ones who would
cut a perfect line through a pile of leaves

                              And OPEN MIKE
The Down River Poets writing group started in 1986 when it's leader,
Joan Halperin, was awarded a grant to run a workshop for English high
school teachers in the Westchester schools. These teachers were
especially interested in developing further skills and ideas for
teaching poetry in their classrooms. After the funded sessions were
over, the group continued privately. Other poets joined; some from other
fields of work. Now these women were working on their own writing and at
the same time bringing ideas and enthusiasm for the process of writing
back to the classroom. The members of the group are Sue Case, who
teaches in the Greenville Middle School, Dina Hofstetter, an art teacher
at Scarsdale High School: Nancy Krim, an English teacher at Scarsdale
High School, Cindy McDonald, an English teacher, who has recently
retired from Fox Lane High School: Arlene Oraby who is Chairman of the
English Department at Briarcliff High School: Jo Ellen Moldoff who is
Dean of counseling at Scarsdale High School and Laura Rice who teaches
English at Hastings High School.

Murat. You might but I'm not sure what LP criticism is...do you mean
criticism of Langpo? I dont think its productive to criticise things (unless
one's getting paid for it or one is in a bad mood): or do you mean criticism
by a Langpo personage? I'm not a Langpoist per se but it is very
interesting..I mean everything is interesting. I like young Ron's stuff...
and many of the other's but I like a wide range of writing. It would be
better to go through the whole text of my message as it shows it in context.
No?  But my regards to you, Richard Taylor. PS what I meant re "The bee th
size of a cat" was the example of the way the writing (for me) anyway can
"swing" in mood or meaning: and I find those things "funny" but recall that
laughing can be a positive response. If one can laugh at something its th
beginning of "dealing with it". Many people..more than we'll ever
know...wouldnt bother opening R Silliman's book let alone trying to "deal
with it". I'm not an academic just a dabbler in lit. with poetry as a hobby.
(If I do have a crit. its mild: that many of the Langpos seem rather dour at
times but that's maybe a bit unfair..)
 By the way I like spinach and also silverbeet which I grow in my garden.

 * Teenagers from Fukuoka Die in Tokyo
Two high school girls from Kasuya, Fukuoka committed suicide yesterday
when they jumped from the top of a multi-storey building in Tokyo. The
girls left a message " We have no special reason to die, but then again we
have no reason to live either".

Paul Green wrote Communicator, a prose poem in five sections, without the
use of the letter e. He acknowledges Perec in a preface. It was published by
Prest Roots Press in around 1997. Ecorche magazine edited by Ian Taylor is
planning to bring out an issue devoted to Communicator in the near future of
which more later.

I think it is an astonishing piece of work and when I read it I am amused
and terrified. I don't have the text with me now but will post a piece or
two from it later. It is a writerly performance which intrigues me. Reading
the book aloud is also such an unusual experience. Without the clipped 'ed'
of the completed past tense my mouth feels perpetually stretched wide trying
to sound all those 'o's and 'a's.

And without an 'e', poet goes to pot. Subjectivity disappearing in a puff of
smoke.

Ian

Richard Tylr asks:

"Ron. Could you work (or have worked) eg in Tjanting without a formal
principle like the Fibonnacci? What is the state of your current project?
Speak into the microphone: "Speak louder!"..."Speak softer!"...Sorry, my
stupid jokes....
Actually I am a major fan of Tjanting...I can open it up at any place and it
is hypnotic: an extraordinary work....Mind you, it depends on my mood
etc.... What letter are you up to? Do you have a new "project"?  I've got
the "Baldessari edition" (second printing). "Lit" 's good too. and I very
much got into "Paradise". Compared notes onthat with Wystan Curnow. He's a
great "projector". Any way...Good on you. Regards, Richard."

At the time of Tjanting I still needed the structure in order to break down
habits of thinking that would otherwise have me from joining up sentences in
new ways. Structure has something of a different role in my work these days.

I'm presently working on three letters of The Alphabet: Ketjak2: Caravan of
Affect (literally the next paragraph of Ketjak a quarter of a century
later); VOG (whose structure is that it is a "book of poems"), and Zyxt, a
long prose piece. When those are completed, so is The Alphabet.

As for the next project thereafter, I'd recommend reading Anselm Hollo's
poem "Not a form at all but a state of mind," in Corvus -- great book, by
the way -- for the last line of the second stanza of section V. The answer
is hidden there.

I'm making notes as I go along as to what the next project might entail. 360
sections, at least one of which will use the number 2701 (the product of the
"palindrome" prime numbers 37 and 73).

Say Hi to Wystan. I'm still reading his father's collected poems & greatly
enjoying same,

Ron

Announcing the publication of

(the invisible city)

an anthology of art and poetry inspired by Italo Calvino's book, Invisible
Cities, edited by Richard O'Russa and Karoline Schleh (art) and Marcella
Durand (poetry) and published by Erato Press, a collaborative fine-arts and
letterpress based in New Orleans and New York.

Contributors include:

Poets Will Alexander, Anselm Berrigan, Marcella Durand, Joe Elliot, Betsy
Fagin, Laird Hunt, Lisa Jarnot, Rachel Levitsky, Brian Lucas, Pattie
McCarthy, Ricardo Matthews, Alice Notley, Kristin Prevallet, Lytle Shaw,
Eleni Sikelianos, Edwin Torres, Kevin Varrone, and Karen Weiser

Parker, Elizabeth Castagna, Mitchell Long, Lisette Copping, Erin Tapely,
Sandy Chism, Meredith Hedges, and Tom Varisco

From the Introduction by Marcella Durand: "Cities are invisible and mutable.
They emit and transmit. They filter and judge. They are ridiculous and
serene. They move through space and time as words move through pages, as art
moves through air to vision. When they are buried in 1,000 years, they will
emerge doubly compelling, with towers more fantastical than when they were
built. And where Kublai Khan and Marco Polo play chess on that far eastern
plain, they are in that eternal city that shudders about them as they spin
tales of where they have been and where they are."

To order (the invisible city), please send check or money order for $15
to Richard O'Russa or Marcella Durand

ED FRIEDMAN AND LORENZO THOMAS
Since 1987, Ed Friedman has served as Artistic Director of The Poetry
Project. His titles include Mao & Matisse, and three 2001 publications: Away
(Granary Books) Drive Through Blue Cylinders (Hanging Loose Press), and The
Funeral Journal (Jensen/Daniels). Writes Murat Nemet-Nejat, "Mao & Matisse
is exquisitely attuned to this historical moment. Its texture embodies the
cultural minutiae of its time and its issues." Lorenzo Thomas is a widely
published poet and critic whose works have appeared in many journals
including African American Review, Arrowsmith, Blues Unlimited, Partisan
Review, and Ploughshares. In his most recent book, Extraordinary Measures:
Afrocentric Modernism and 20th-Century American Poetry (University of
Alabama Press), Mr. Thomas reassesses the development of African American
poetry within the context of modernism and the troubled racial history of
the United States. His collection of poems, Chances Are Few, is "fresh,
individual, and alive. ... an excellent book," writes Stephen Stephanchev,
author of American Poetry Since 1945.

Friday, May 18th at 10:30 pm
FUNDAMENTALIST PROPHECY, HOMOEROTICISM, AND CANDLES
Our beloved Friday night coordinator Regie Cabico is celebrating his
birthday in Late Night Reading Series Style! Things are going to get campy,
as Regie becomes for one night only the (female?) cabaret singer he's always
wanted to be. Performers include spoken word performance ensemble
Shakespeare's Monkey and poets Henry Flesh and Lex Lonehood.

Monday, May 21st at 8 pm
DIANA RICKARD AND ROGER SNELL
New York native Diana Rickard's poems, which lull the comfortable reader
into the completely unexpected and oddly delightful, have appeared in Ixnay,
Mungo vs. Ranger and Bombay Gin. Roger Snell, co-editor of the poetry and
prose journal Mungo vs. Ranger, has a letterpress imprint, Sardines Press,
which is releasing Donald Guravich's A Brief History of Flying in April 2001
and produces an ongoing broadside series. He is a veteran aircrew member of
the U.S. Air Force, and has lived on a bus with 23 others.

Wednesday, May 23rd at 8 pm
WANG PING AND LEWIS WARSH
Wang Ping, born in Shanghai, has lived in the U.S. since 1985. Her works
include a book of poems, Of Flesh & Spirit; a novel, Foreign Devil; a short
story collection, American Visa (all from Coffee House Press); and a work of
cultural criticism, Aching for Beauty: Footbinding in China (University of
Minnesota Press). Commenting on Of Flesh & Spirit, the poet Lyn Hejinian
writes, "This book is wonderful." Lewis Warsh's most recent book of poems,
The Origin of the World, was published by Creative Arts Book Company in
spring 2001. A book of stories, Touch of the Whip, is forthcoming from
Singing Horse Press. He is co-editor of The Angel Hair Anthology,
forthcoming from Granary Books, summer 2001. He is editor and publisher of

KISS IT UP TO GOD: POETRY, FUNK AND GOSPEL WITH NADINE MOZON AND FRIENDS
Nadine Mozon and friends read from her new book of  poetry, Kiss It Up to
God. The themes in this collection of work "comb entangled hairitage kinks
and issues, wrestle with womanish ways, and revel in a determined spirit."
Ms. Mozon will be accompanied by the jazz-funk/gospel sounds of Darren Hicks
on bass and special guest poets.

In 2002 Pavement Saw Press will release Carroll Arnett’s Collected
Books.

To celebrate this, for $3, including postage, we will send Arnett's
_Night Perimeter_ (New and Selected Poems 1958-1990), a perfect bound, 4
color cover edition, 176 page volume. 2 copies for $4.50, 3 copies for
$5.25. All we ask for is a name and full address for *each copy ordered*
(no exceptions) so we can follow up with a mailing about the Collected
Books.

We are grateful to Joseph Bruchac III, editor of the Greenfield Review
Press for making this offer possible and agreeing to work with Pavement
Saw Press’ release of the Collected.

----------------------

Arnett, a Cherokee Indian author, lived in Michigan up until his passing
in 1997. Of his twelve collections of poems, the most widely distributed
was Night Perimeter, a selected poems released by Greenfield Review
Press in 1991. With the exception of Night Perimeter, all of his books
were published in editions of 400 or less. From his first collection,
_That_ in 1965, until 1979, Elizabeth Press, one of the most important
American publishers in the latter half of the 20th century; whose books
helped establish Simon Perchik, William Bronk, Lorine Niedecker,
Theodore Enslin, Larry Eigner, Cid Corman, John Taggart and many others,
was his publisher. After Night Perimeter, three chapbooks were released:
Rounds (Cross-Cultural Communications Press) Engine (Point Riders Press)
and the gorgeously produced Spells (Bloody Twin Press). With the
exception of this Selected, all of his books are out of print (even
Spells which we had the honor of distributing).

Richard,

I meant you criticizing language poets. Sorry for the mix-up. Amazing, the
ability of Language Poetry to evoke so much verbiage.

In "eating your spinach" comment I was referring to some Lang. Poets (no
names here) claiming that a poem can legitimately be boring. Now, I would
say, it can not.

My best,

Murat

I dont know this Komunyaka but maybe you're a bit harsh on workshop poets:
there's no inherent rationale against teaching poetry or any creative art.
Although one teaches or probably encourages ideas by practice. Prior to that
one assumes a writer has a considerable knowledge of literature. Then a well
organised course with a range of teachers can generate enthusiasm and
students can practise their skills. Obviously there needs to be that sparkle
or whatever but I think I would have benefited from such a course. Just as
all other teaching areas have become more sophisticated why not literature
and poetry? And some people dont feel comfortable "attacking" things all the
time...they may not be "grovellers"...Anyway I see the Language poetry
people as having had an enormous positive influence as well as various
teaching schools.
  Of course there are some people who can come from "outside" but I think
that such creative writing degrees give young people a chance to study what
they love...and that is now no longer felt to be "useless" or
"nonproductive" anymore than any other leisure or art is...
 But I dont know about the politics...of course there's going to be a lot of
that...but the individual can fight that...most academics are probably glad
of new ideas.
  Maybe this bloke is a "bad egg" but whose to judge? Prizes and
competitions: great to win but nobody would admit they like losing! Only
natural...anyway its no good getting accolades or money in the long run if
you're no good...but then whose to know?
 If an anti "clean nose Langpo" had won a whole lot of money then the "anti
anti Langpo people" would be seriously annoyed. Nobody wins. As Emannuel
Lasker (once the World Chess Champion) used to say: "In life we are all
duffers."  Peace brother! Tedious, you say? "A tedious argument of insidious
intent." Regards, Richard.

It's called _La Disparition_, which includes the pun on the absence of the
"e" -- though indeed La Disposition doesn't have one either.

& Yes, "La Vie, Mode d'emploi" is a marvellous book, as are his other
writings, especially the list work of all he sees out the window of the Café
de la Mairie, Place Saint Sulpice, where I have often sat readiong him.

I think you are referring to La disparition .

In German it is published as Anton Voyls Fortgang,

and in Spanish as El secuestro,

in which it is the letter a that is missing, because, of course, a is
more common than e in Spanish.

Both LIFE: A USER'S MANUAL and Perec's A VOID are available (as the titles
I just gave indicate) in English in paperback editions -- A VOID is a
translation tour de force -- I'd thought that an untranslatable book --
Both well worth your reading --

Hi Nate,
in my haste sending it I obviously neglected to include publication details
for the Catling. ... it is £9.95 plus £1 postage and packing. It can be had
direct from me at my home address,or from
Rod Mengham, Jesus College, Cambridge, CB5 8BL. Glad you think its handsome!
It was very tight getting it done in time.

Annual Poetry Center Book Award goes to Canadian poet Kevin Davies

The Poetry Center is pleased to announce the winner of this year's Poetry
Center Book Award.  Kevin Davies book Comp. (2000, published by Edge Books,
of Washington, DC) was selected by this year's judge for the award,
prolific San Francisco writer Kevin Killian, from among over 200 entries.
The annual award has been given since 1980 to a single outstanding book of
poetry published in the past year.  Previous winners of the award include:
Alice Notley, Sharon Olds, Larry Eigner, Laura Moriarty, Jackson Mac Low,
Yusef Komunyakaa, Lyn Hejinian, Luis J. Rodriguez, Adrian Louis, Leslie
Scalapino, C.D. Wright, Barbara Guest, Elaine Equi, and Cole Swensen.

The judge's citation reads as follows:

With pleasure I bestow the 2000 Poetry Center Book Award on Kevin Davies
and his book Comp.  (Edge Books).  Comp. is a book of great passion and
intelligence, entwined together like the two creepy snakes of the caduceus.
Davies seems to know all about class, money, politics, labor, and how the
debates behind them form our notions of sexuality, power and aesthetics
(beauty).  He's persuasive, forceful enough to make me believe, and reading
his book, one finds page after page of emotional sustenance, the hot fire
of anger and the chill of a wonderful mind.  "Can't," "couldn't," "didn't,"
the words used most frequently in Comp., are followed by "if," an enactment
of deracination and despair leavened by a subjunctive hope, and by Kevin
Davies' own coruscating wit.  He's the Stanley Kubrick of poetry (and I
mean that in a good way), and Comp. is the most invigorating poem I've read
in a long, long time.

-Kevin Killian

Kevin Davies was born and raised on Vancouver Island.  In the 1980s he was
active in the Vancouver poetry community and was a member of the Kootenay
School of Writing collective.  Since 1992 he has lived in New York City,
where he is now employed as a financial proofreader.  Pause Button (Tsunami
Editions, Vancouver, 1992) and Comp. form the first two parts of his
Trilogy of Error, which will be completed by his current work in progress,
The Golden Age of Paraphernalia.

Kevin Killian is a poet, novelist, critic, and playwright.  He has written
a book of stories, Little Men (1996), which won the PEN Oakland award for
fiction, two novels, Shy (1989) and Arctic Summer (1997), a book of
memoirs, Bedrooms Have Windows (1989), and, with Lew Ellingham, co-wrote
the biography Poet Be Like God: Jack Spicer and the San Francisco
Renaissance (1998).  His poetry and fiction have been widely anthologized;
he has reported on the Bay Area art scene for numerous magazines; and, an
active member of San Francisco's Poets Theater, he has written or
co-written thirty plays for them.  With Dodie Bellamy he coedits the

 KARENINA.IT (poetry in "fàtica" function)
A web project by Caterina Davinio davinio@tin.it on line since 1998
By Jakobson, 'fàtico' is the use of the language which has the finality to
maintain open and operative the communication channel among the
interlocutors. On the confine between art and critic, happening and net
performance, Karenina.it is a virtual meeting place around the theme of the
writing and the new technologies, in which experiences of international
artists, curators, theoreticians converge, in a net that counts thousands of
contacts in the world.

Scott:  A stronger action might be to try to bring to international (American) attention the ~poetry~ of
these poets.  You might check with Moshe' Machover whether anything is in translation yet, or if he/you
could help facilitate that. ---  I am not sure whether collectively authoring a (non-literary)
~counter~-text, "some sort of open letter" in reaction to the suppression or endangerment of a ~previous~
text really approaches the level of threat that the original text posed to its would-be censors.  The
linguistic danger ("Language and Symbolic Violence") resides in the works of the authors named below: the
three Saut al Halk u'al-Huriya publishers, poet-columnist Abdel Hakim Masalha, and veteran journalist
Muhamad Ali Taha.  It's a pity --- and slightly surprising --- that Ha'aretz did not include any quotes from
the poetry; surprising, because I think here even a "big baddie" newspaper like the NYT would probably
include some snippet.  Perhaps that's some indication that the censorship already ~is~ at play, at least by
our standards: the journalism seems ~incomplete~ to me as a USA-habituated reader, without some side-bar
quoting the work.  ---  XXth century repressive regimes indeed often do fear poetry. (It remains to be seen
whether XXIst cent. regimes will continue in that vein--- or whether global "free market" does not do away
with the need for censorship by depreciating the efficacy of all text through overabundance.  Historic
repressive regimes have sometimes been great patrons of poetry: imperial Rome to the Aeneid.)  As in China
("repressive regime"?), obfuscation and the ambiguities of poetry are typically feared as possibly
concealing a "secret message," code-fear, cryptophobia.  "Clear," "straightforward" poetry (perhaps like
Masalha's) is hard for us anymore to even imagine as "subversive."  American '60's Ginsberg/beatnik poetry
was clear.  It's telling that the recent "First Four Hundred Days" anthology called for "scatalogy,
satire...", that is, for clear, non-obscure.   --- Jeffrey

Dear list,

Some time ago I posted a request for information on a book by Abraham
Lincoln Gillespie, "The Syntactic Revolution" (ed. by Richard Milazzo),
and received a few helpful responses. Unfortunately, I still haven't
managed to locate a copy of it (tried bookfinder.com already).
Does anyone know where I can find this? I'm thinking of integrating some
of his work into a multimedia piece I'm doing at the Centre for
contemporary Arts in Glasgow this coming November. Any suggestions would
be helpful at this point...so little of his work is in print at the
moment. (exceptions in McCaffery's anthology Imagining Language and
Rothenberg's Revolution of the Word...).

thanks

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Two citations from Oulipo.

First, to boost morale, one half of a pyramid poem by Harry Matthews, which
is dedicated to Martin Gardner and opens Oulipo's _Atlas of Potential
Literature_:

"O/to/see/man's/stern/poetic/thought/publicly/espousing/recklessly/imaginati
ve/mathematical/inventiveness,/openmindedness/unconditionally/superfecundati
ng/nonantagonistical/hypersophisticated/interdenominational/interpenetrabili
ties."

(2) from Roubaud's book _The inverse Flower..._ (1986):

"To write poems, to compose poetry in contemporary conditions is a rather
difficult exercise, it's agreed.  In order to persist in this path supposes
(at any rate for me) the choice of a model, the reference to a favored era
in which poetry _was_ and _glimmered_.  I've chosen 12th Century
Provence..." (p. 17)

Conclusion:

Oulipo recognizes that formal innovation is an attribute of so-called
traditional form, and that a superb understanding of tradition will permit
one to work within poetry, not against it.  This is to be distinguished,
perhaps, from the historical non-appreciations of a competetive and gangly
coterie.  The non-recognition of mathematics on the part of metaphysics is
a spectacularly dismal and romantic failure stained with the pasts of
piracy, domination, and privateering.  One may also consult the the works
of Albert-Marie Schmidt (Oulipo).

jl.

P.S.,
On Perec, also see the novel he was working on before he died his smoky
death, _53 Days_,
which includes many pages from his notebooks.  I enjoy most seeing his
operations, the manners in which he worked.  Oulipo is a superb craftsman.

From Publishers Weekly daily email:

Caveat Emptor: Authors Guild Blasts iPublish Contract

In a blow to Time Warner Trade Publishing (TWTP), the Authors Guild has
issued a sharp warning to writers about signing the e-publishing contract
offered by iPublish.com, TWTP recently launched e-publishing venture.

The Authors Guild warned that the iPublish.com contract "presents
substantial legal risks and loss of literary rights for little pay." The
Guild urges all writers to "approach iPublish with extreme caution,"
warning that established writers "may find they've inadvertently granted a
laundry list of rights" for low advances--$25 or less.

Letty Cottin Pogrebin, president of the Authors Guild, described the
contract as "pitiful," "exploitive" and "draconian." Paul Aiken, executive
director of the Authors Guild, told PW Daily, "By submitting a manuscript
online, you are agreeing to terms. This is unusual and there is the
potential for people to not understand what they are agreeing to."

Ipublish.com offers well-known TWTP authors in e-book form, and aims to
create an online writers community, soliciting new writing from that
community to publish as e-books, print-on-demand titles or in traditional
print.

The contract is available online at ipublish.com. The Authors Guild advises
that the iPublish contract makes "sweeping" claims to digital and print
rights and is critical of iPublish's plans to not pay advances for e-books.
The Guild notes that TWTP's option to publish e-books in print form is
crafted to limit the size of advances and to prevent writers from
effectively negotiating a competing bid from another publisher. The Guild
warns that signing for one book gives TWTP exclusive rights to the author's
next work, and that there is no provision in the contract for insuring
authors against libel claims.

In iPublish's own defense, Claire Zion, iPublish's editorial director,
issued a statement saying "We're disappointed that The Author's Guild chose
to misrepresent iPublish's relationship with writers." Zion goes on to say
that iPublish is a vehicle for disenfranchised writers who "can't get a
publisher to read their work because they don't have an agent. They can't
get an agent because they don't have any connections." She added, "They
can't even get into the Author's Guild because they aren't previously
published."

TWTP claims "nothing we ask for in our contract is unusual" and that it is
"fair and highly favorable to unpublished writers." The company has
something they call a "contract helper" available on their Web site that
explains iPublish's terms and why they believe they are necessary.

The statement didn't address any specific points raised by the
guild.--Calvin Reid

hello,

I thought I'd post a reminder that RADDLE MOON's address changed about 5 years ago.
We are still getting mail at our old address.

This unfortunately included a parcel rec'd last Nov.20 which was ret'd. without any record
of where or who it came from. Anyone out there with a ret'd parcel?

our NEW address is: #518-350 East Second Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5T 4R8 CANADA

our OLD address was : 2239 Stephens Street, Vancouver
If you've sent mail -- other than oversize parcels which are held only a couple of weeks
at the post office before they're ret'd to sender -- to the Stephens Street address, I do
go over there once every few months to pick it up, but there's no absolute guarantee it'll
be kept, or be safe.

Susan

Ouilippo sound an interesting group. A small point of course with all formal
processes and procedures of course (I feel of course ) is that eg in the
example of la Disparition or what it is called..the "e" being omitted is
both a restraint (nothing new there cf Frost or most of the peots in English
since Chaucer and I believe the French more so) but also that its
significance is (as I know somehow "e" is the letter most used) and is a
sound generating and hence inportant meaning generator..its disapperance is
alarming! and amusing.... and I suppose there are all the Derridean things
etc (I know of him only indirectly I have a book of his which I opened and
the first sentence I saw was: "This then shall have been a book." I was very
impressed with that so as the rest looked very prolix I shut the book and
let that sentence work the non) and thus the concept of syncope....but one
at least assumes that there is a greater rationale than merely number
play...which play is allright up to a point..but I eventually am moved to
ask "why" so eg just removing the "a" or the "e" is a good exercise but how
much of an advance is this say on just continuing with sonnets forever? But
the Perec novel I must read...it doesnt bother me that eg Jealousy has no
obvious "meaning" or "plot" or "development" or is studiously
"non-referential" with its detail (in fact its repetitions could be seen as
nearly a traditionalist and a rhyming device as it cycles and slowly
chimes...I love that book...but one asssumes that Robbet-Grillet has an
agenda...even if its to "challenge" the old forms etc etc but this Perec
must have a larger raison d'etre
   An effect of form can be a certain strangeness that is introduced as in
old and mysterious rhymes...formal methods have both a look or rationale of
the magical and also that of a logical system: the sonnet seems to me to be
a strange capsule, quite arbitrary...so the problem with various forms is
maybe their overuse: a very basic example being rhyme. And its dubious that
any numbers are higher or more significant than any others. I'm arguing with
myself. Someone please take up the baton!   Richard.

George. Did you see the series of poems (one liners!) where I meditate on
poetry etc and say Ron Silliman and George Bowering are poets...things like
that? Thanks for the info below...one tends to forget the problems of
translation. I knew that "e" is the most common vowel in English...but the
of course a Spanish writer would omit the "a" which would be impossible for
me even if my Spanish was more than one year at uni and not thus very
good...virtually zero...and as to German...hopeless. But I believe that even
in English Perec's book is quite impressive. Another vast tome to be
tackled...one day. Maybe the cavity left by the absence of the vowel creates
a kind of negative force: which energises somewhow? Interesting.  Regards,
Richard Taylor.

Marc. Look on eg Bibliofind, Abeboks.com, or AddAll which has these and
other out of print and rare books forsale. Abe..has about 27 milllion books
online throught the world. And you can leave a request for a book and they
search for it automatically until it turns up. Use a search engine like
dogppile to get AddAll and Abe etc. Hope this helps. Regards, Richard

Pierre. This is very subversive. Your encouraging an old unemployed
scrounger and general dabbler in things trivial but enjoyable to read
another vast tome!? to interrupt his endless Chess games on ICC!!
Disgraceful! Tres Disgracefellement! I'm struggling through...actually I
love it.... "Middlemarch"... but now I've been ordered to read Perec which I
could have picked up in a bookshop about 18 months ago...and which I think
Scott Hamilton has (Scott has read anything that everyone else hasnt ... or
everything that such old blokes like myself have never heard of...or he's at
least held the alleged tome in his hands...probably got it at a sale for 20
cents!! ) But, seriously, thanks for that...I must have a look at it. I dont
want to become too obsessed with numbers etc but it sounds intriguing....I
like Robbet-Grillet and have read Roussell's books (two of them)  so I
suppose I "should" tackle this stupendous and  word massive  construction or
is it a deconstrucion? A constructive deconstructive construction whose
construct is deconstructed by its constructive deconstruct. Something like
that.  It's very unreadness increaseth but doth not detracteth my desire to
thus peruse. Yours etcetera and e to the power of x, Richard Taylor.

MARC!! its by OUT OF LONDON BOOKS isbn 0-915570-05 printed in 1980,, covers
a lotta stuff,, letters and works,, Richard Kostalanetz helped me get my
copy back in 1989 or there abouts!! he helped because at the time he thought
it safer for me to pay him for the copy rather than see my cash evaporate
and no book turn up by going direct to the publisher whyche he seemed to
think to be a bit lax, i think richard got it in a bookstore 'round the
corner from him maybe there is a dusty copy still hanging about given the
bad crit Gillespie continues to ride, on that i would have thought the
L=A=N=G lot would have welcomed some of his writings as precurser
stuff,,,,dunno///pete spence

ECOPOETICS is still accepting work for its summer issue.

The deadline, however, is just TWO weeks away (6/4), so don't sit on that
piece you've been meaning to send me!

NOTE: I have gotten quite a few poems and some essays but little from the
other submission categories suggested at the end of my call.  ECOPOETICS is
still seeking a range of materials.  Eco-reviews of recent, innovative work
would be highly useful.  As would anything (intelligently) polemical.  Poems
will, of course, still be considered.

Thanks.

ECOPOETICS-- CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS!

Now that the days are longer, consider contributing to ECOPOETICS / writing
surrounds.

While honoring the long tradition of "nature writing," ECOPOETICS finds
pastoralism, art representing nature, at an impasse.  At the same time, the
writing edge seems to offer no new take on surrounds, mainly environmental
silence, or passive regrets.  If there are exceptions, ECOPOETICS hopes to
gather them.

ECOPOETICS seeks responses to the question: _where_ is writing?  Whose
leaves are contiguous to body, street, yard, park or waterfront, sky, lawn,
brownfield, industry, farmland, or the "wild"-- environs from the porch to
the South Pole-- in every case peopled with more than humans.

If, as O'Hara claims, "one never need leave the confines of New York to get
all the greenery one wishes," any _where_ entails an extended sense of
people, into other species, and a "greenery" subject to waste
(mis)management; flows and deposits of gases, heavy metals and synthetic
organic compounds; eco-nomics; and the growing map of environmental
injustice.  Might not discourses and practices of soil, water, air, energy
make poetics?  Responses from other languages, especially translated along
north-south lines, are urgently sought.

Examples and discussion both are invited: poems, translations, essays,
reviews, letters, journals, investigations, lists, divinations, prayers,
riddles, maps, documented acts, performances and installations, unearthings,
practical advice, etc., will be considered.  Preferable means of delivery is
by email attachment.  (If a visually determined piece is accepted, then a
hard copy may be useful.)  ECOPOETICS will read submissions through May,
2001.  Don't miss your chance to participate in the first, exciting issue!

---------------------------------------------------
    ROLL OUR OWN BLACK OUT THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER,
    THURSDAY, JUNE 21
    7-10pm worldwide, all time zones
---------------------------------------------------
In protest of George W. Bush's energy policies and lack of emphasis on
efficiency, conservation and alternative fuels, there will be a planetary
voluntary rolling blackout on the first day of summer, June 21,
from 7pm - 10pm in any time zone (this will roll it across the planet).

It is a simple protest and a symbolic act. Turn out your lights from
7pm-10pm on June 21. Unplug whatever you can unplug in your house. Watch the
sunset! Light a candle to the sungoddess, kiss and tell, make love, tell
ghost
stories, do something outside instead of watching television or playing
videos, have fun in the dark!  See the stars! Have a midsummer fire! Don't
cook:eat sandwiches! Roast marshmallows!

Forward this e-mail as widely as possible, to your government
representativesand environmental contacts. Let them know we want
global education, participation and funding in conservation, efficiency
and alternative fuel efforts -- and an end to over exploitation and
misuse of the earth's resources.

when i begin to think in the depths of darkness and despair
that my spirits have started already to sink, accustomed as they are
 to that bleak lair
where they have remained, sullen, sodden, unblinked, in the dank air
then already i am moved to the hulled brink of the ship already there
and waiting while i turn from heavy food and drink to a more ferocious
 pair
of arms and murdered thighs that link drugged venom to sickened skin,
 so perfect and so bare
redolent with thick chains that clink as if the body coupled to them
 were without a care
as words spill, totter, and drowning, sink in the wombs of her marine
 lover, her nightmare
coursing through the chink remaining after day has gone, her arms
 weaving, churning, as if to tear
the dull atmosphere, thrust and knotted, kink and close to broken,
 her disheveled hair
wild and wayward, contrary, a potential well or sink or source of her
 eyes' moans and stare
bleak across the flesh, pink, ripened, split open, already hard to bear
thought of any sort, nothing of those eyes, a wink, nothing harsh
 to wear
beyond the rotted stink, beyond the broken chair, beyond her one last
 dare, beyond the sward, the mink fink, beyond the rare, the fair,
then does that bleak lair rise from what were the harsh sink
in still harsher air, eyes tied open, unblinked
there, near ships hull hovering on the brink
while i double, split, an ugly pair engorged on gorge's drink
and half of me bare and half all ready now to link
with the utmost care, my chains are broken, clink
down from this nightmare, and once again they sink
and wither from my flesh and tear through my last remaining chink
i'm bound with her thick hair, a form of sputtered kink
my eyes are open, stare, this naked body yet another sink
of holes spread and bare, the wanton image darkened brown and pink
and naked, not a thing to wear, as if a joke or wink
or dare in the right place, or chair or drink, her fair pink
self against my stink, bound in that bleak lair, the mink
tied hard, i doubled, harsh sink and bleak lair fair and sink.

Murat. Usually I'm suspicious of people who "wipe" language poetry (as if
that movement can be easily delineated. They either havent studied it too
strongly or they are very reactionary and old fashioned. I think that by
"inherently boring" you could just as well be referring to John Ashbery who
comments in various places how he is interested in those moments in which we
are waiting for things...literally waiting in a bus que. It seems his
writing involves simultaneously an attack and a celebration of and on
popular culture and art, politics, modern life and so on. But these moments
are still interesting and so the so called language writers are dealing I
think (in some ways more directly and deliberately) with what were once
ostensibly "boring subjects". I'm currently reading "Radical Artifice" by
Marjorie Perloff which shows an example of Bernstein's work which is very
clever and also very deliberate but far from boring. Mind you you might find
that writing so. I fnd that its like music: sometimes I want to listen to a
contemporary composer, or jazz, or whatever, but my core listening is Bach.
But then suddenly I dont want to know about Bach after weeks of listening to
him...currently I cant listen to Beethoven. I find it too intrusive...or any
popular music or jazz. But that's me and sometimes I want to read "New
Yorker poems" and cant read any contemporary poetry or "avant garde" poetry
or what you will. I see it as its possible for anyone do do whatever they
like as long as they dont restrict others. (So I'm mellowing, or am I
getting dotty?!)...its  not as simple as that, but that's how I am. I think
that if a writer has no talent (or do we all have some talent?does that
matter?) it doesnt matter what "school" they belong to or what literary
philosophy they have. (But maybe I'm wrong on that as well.) I'm no more for
or against the language poets than I'm for or against eg Keith Douglas whom
I actually consider (from the point of view of pure talent) to be one of the
greatest poets who ever lived.But hardly "innovative" per se.
   But some music is "difficult" to listen to but rewards work or at least
attention by the listener. Other more contemporary things encourage or
require action by the listener/participant...a similar parallel maybe
exisists in the lit world. I will concede that some writers I find too
resistive. I just put them aside and think  that maybe one day I'll "get
it": but it doesnt matter, there's a lot to read.
  There's a vast range of interesting writing out there and some highly
talented writers of all skills and ilks. In fact, in my criticism of the New
Formalists, I think I understand the why of their torment. Its possible they
have some very bright people amongst their group or whoever they are..but
the NF thing doesnt interest me except insofar as in the questions it
prompts.
  But as to verbiage: that's what we humans do. We talk! Some talk a lot,
some a little: it just depends on which recipe you got cooked by. Regards,
Richard Taylor.

Well, I don't know how you read this.  This seems like a watered-down version
of the Napster debate, re-packaged: technophobia, paper fetishism, proprietary
rights over universals . . .

---  Do "plans not to pay advances" or "low advances" have any relevance or
threat in a poetry context, where advances are non-existent? (Of course,
iPublish does not even include poetry in its list of genres: fiction,
nonfiction, business, romance, mystery, science fiction, and--- innovations
[New Age].)  $25 would be more than first book poets are getting now (outside
of contests)!  Claire Zion's defense sounds quite believable: there are plenty
of sadsacks out there who haven't got a clue, and iPublish is offering a
discrete training field.

Theirs sounds like a novel approach, actually: a 15-pp. excerpt is circulated
to their on-line members who offer group feedback, and then on the basis of
group "ratings," a MS may be moved on to editors, thence into e-form/POD.  It's
about audience-building.

In their member's form, one of the options on "What kind of (e-)books do you
like to read?" one of the options is "Experimental."

Meanwhile, The Authors Guild promotes no such reader/writer cultivation (that I
know of) and is almost exclusively devoted to litiginous matters such as
contract advice, etc.

It remains my current understanding that on-line "publishing" is not legally
recognized as publishing, any more than having a work read on the radio is
publishing.

I am stitching together an exquisite corpse of stanzas like the following
two.  I want at least thirty.  Feel free to vary it as you desire, but my
editorial scissors make the final cut.  I'll publish the results at
meaningless.com with contributor credits.   On your marks... get set... GO!!



The body eats its melons, sure.
But what grows from my seed patch now?
Say! I think it's a batch of pink monkeys!
I will send them out in a canoe, green and stripey.

"What will the body think of next?"


The body loves to rumba, Pop.
So please excuse me while I kiss the sky.
Please forgive me while I light my gas-soaked slacks
and dance the burning stinkbug dance!

Final Pornography: The Body of Jennifer-Alan


But I've never done a pornographic film, sex show, public display. And the
decathecting of the (pornographic?) image, perhaps, through the dark sha-
dow, the premonition of uneasy sexuality, pornography, is nearly as radic-
alized. It might be the difference between pornography, which partakes of
the exhaustion of pornography, turning-away from the image effluvia and
the substance in pornography that defuges; there is a constellation - por-
nography / fetishization / rhyme - rhythm a stride or unconscious.
 *  nikuko-america wants to watch your cock
In pornography, it is the image on the level of the symbolic which uncon-
sciously appertains to the unconscious. In the pornographic image, the man
or woman are inchoate accusations of the other; the trashed pornographic
image is used up. In this sense, in rhyme and the pornographic image, life
itself is a form of pornographic exhaustion. I think the secrecy is criti-
cal; again and again - it's the appeal of pornography - the next image
will tend towards the exhaustion of pornography, the turning-away from the
image effluvia.
 *  nikuko-america wants to show you her cunt
It is the substance in pornography that defuges; the image on the level of
the symbolic which unconsciously appertains to the unconscious. In porno-
graphy, not to mention adulterers, oral sex fanatics, consumers of the
other, their _place(ment)_ - as if the pornographic would, in the first
instance, impoverish all of us.
 *  nikuko-america wants to put your hot cock in his hot pussy
No one wants pornography; no one looks at it: terrorist manuals on the
Net, child pornography, and anarchic hackers whose pornographic breath is
held until the orgasm from which one never recovers.
 *  nikuko-america wants to swallow your hot cock
Off with pornographic photographs taken of my bloodshot eyes. Get it over
tumescence. The Web pornography industry is bringing in more than a change
of pornographic images, and general tropologies of fetishization. I down-
loaded pornographic image after image tonight, from several newsgroups of
amateur pornography for example. The roughness and irresolution of low and
more pornographic - the waves practice your imaginary stroke at my frieze:
my pornography goes unnamed, it's that which stirs these remarks of an eye
- a pornography based on the revelation of planes.
 *  nikuko-america wants you to squeeze his breasts
Pornography happens when a pornographic picture no longer 'works,' or when
you're an anime and pornography entwined at numerous junctions (all across
the playing-field); so does pornography become an intrinsic part of every-
day flirting with xxx segueing into disbelief and pornography. My work is
not pornography, titillation, stories, parables; it is not a habitual cra-
ving, in the depth of the night, pornographic and luxurious, pornography
... she arches, u beneath, pornog, its penis, its vagina, u Tiffanyalan
 *  nikuko-america wants to drink your cum over his breasts and twat
The membrane appears in the guise of discarded pornography; one is thrust
into pure consumption, no longer beneath the guise of another pornography,
always exhausted. If emission is the order of pornography, spew is the
order of pornography used and reused, raised to the order of the other of
a splayed pornography; the screen/user into praxis spewed and wasted. Both
seep, leak, transgress, both are discarded, and the delay, this endless
procurement reminiscent of pornographic flow, is discarded (and the consu-
mer readied for a new sexual pornography); both regimes imply a continuous
reinscribing of orgasm wasting the pornographic image; turning-away or
face-to-face projects again. No pornography whatsoever! It's harmful!
 *  nikuko-america wants to show you his cock
Pornography of the dead opens inconceivable flesh encapsulated only in im-
mense occasioning circulations. A mass seeps through Pornography from
Revolution, its Holes in one Binary, a Time-Waster Killing our Children.
 *  nikuko-america wants to show you his cock

Here's a found poem consisting of 13 sentences/passages
from a book by John Hawkes, who died not very long ago.
In print, I'd want at least one full page for each section.
Here, there are about two screens for each.

Also, try clicking on the glide-bar down-arrow and just letting
the sentences slide by.

> And I forgot to mention:

The iPublish website (http://www.ipublish.com/general/about.asp) misspells a word
very nicely:

             "and (if it's longer than a hundread pages)".

I think that's a fruitful, Hejinian-ian touch of theirs that deserves
experimentalist imposters inflitrating their iPublish groups to pitch discontinuity
to gullible, sheltered retirees ("No, no, Mrs. White!  All the best-selling
housepet memoirs are asyntactical these days").

        Hey folks:

        Graham Foust and I will be reading in Buffalo, NY Friday, May 25
at 8 p.m. at Rust Belt Books on Allen St. I don't have the exact address,
but I guess if you're in Buffalo you already know where it is, and if
you're not, it doesn't much matter. I hope I'll see you there.

        This is the first time I've been back to Buffalo since the sheriff
chased me out in August 1994. I suppose all my old wanted posters have
bene taken down, yes?

chapbook, Kenning’s first … a beautiful – and lyrical – politicization of
the contemporary act of writing … Though ‘blood & dirt’ get the last word,
the volume is permeated by an etheric sense of light, print, tracery, and
control.”

Subject: Appropriation^4


--
Today something exciting and out of the ordinary, but not entirely
unexpected happened.  Today not one but two different people created
appropriations of my two new sites AfterWalkerEvans.com and
AfterSherrieLevine.com.  First I received a press release from Badur
Ramji informing me of his site AfterMichaelMandiberg which is up at
http://www.scream.ca.  He saw a review on wired
(http://www.wirednews.com/news/culture/0,1284,43902,00.html) and his
response was to build his site, to ask "Should digital expressionism
also be an open source platform?"  His site uses a screen shot of
AfterWalkerEvans.com as its image, and has a compressed zip archive
of the entirety of both of my two sites for download and posting.

Next, I recieved a press release from Kendall Bruns announcing his
new site http://AfterMichaelMandiberg.com.  I had previously received
an email notifying me that he purchased the domain name, though at
that time it was undeveloped.  Kendall's site takes a slightly
different approach, nearly exactly mirroring my sites, altering only
the initial statement, where he inserts himself into the chain of
appropriation.

I think it is totally appropriate, and a lot of fun.  I had hoped
someone would come up with a rejoinder of the sort, as the site is
somewhat begging for it.  Each repetition creates a new authentic
object; each repetition creates a new fake that is one step more
devoid of any (fallacious) real expression.  Each step is one more
iteration of this experiement at the cost of Walker Evans, Sherrie
Levine, and now myself.  I place myself with them in all seriousness,
and at the same time aware of how absurd that statement is.  This is
why I am doing this.  To experience that liminal moment.

Michael

Subject:      MS Magazine botches it with Kane, Mayer, and Jarnot
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

A note to Poetics Folks:

An interview I did with Bernadette Mayer and Lisa Jarnot has just been
published by MS Magazine.  It's worth getting for the picture of Lisa and
Bernadette alone - they look so cool I can hardly contain myself.  The
interview is good fun, as well.

Unfortunately, the MS editors have proved to be generally horrendous -
they delayed giving us our checks for months, published the piece a year
after they said they would, and did not, in conflict with their original
promise, make the interview the "cover story."  Most onerously, the
editors completely gutted my introduction without showing me their edits
(despite my request, in writing, that they show me changes before they
published the piece).  Thus, the intro sounds like it was written by a ten
year old - replete with grammatical errors, redundancies, and so on.

Also, language attributed to Lisa and Bernadette was essentially created
by the editors to fit in to their version of what "feminist" poets should
sound like.  It's interesting to work with a mainstream magazine like
this, because they're clearly not interested in any complicated news,
they're interested in selling a product - in this case, the product is
that their version of feminism exists in the poetry world.

Anyway, I guess my message to Poetics folks is that, if you do indeed read
this particular issue, take this piece with the proverbial grain of salt,
and that I hope you enjoy what Lisa and Bernadette have to say in spite of
the absurd and nauseating intro foisted onto me.   And the picture's cool.

If any of you are interested in seeing the interview as I hoped it would
appear, email me at dkane@panix.com and I'll send it your way.

best,
--daniel kane

A Few Grievances

Your author-function is jam
-ming my landing pad.

Your cherry preserves
came over the Chinese Sea.

Your sign gave the finger
to my signifier.

Your pacifier gave life
to my sucker, but damaged my war machine.

Your sweater induced
perspiration and complemented my green eyes.

Your hurt assuaged my pain
but disrupted my bailiwick.

My candle has been burning longer
than the angels have danced on the head of Bruce
Springsteen,

from before the time you threw my shoe,
since before the beginning of reality

television and JavaScript,
since I emerged from the sea and began breathing air.

Subject:      Let's get the U.S.A. kicked out of FTAA for violating the
              Democracy clause!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Let's get the U.S.A. kicked out of FTAA for violating the Democracy clause!


Proposal By Rebecca Kaplan (Oakland, California)
rebeccak@igc.org

(please pass this on to others who would be interested in this effort)

Background:
With much fanfare, the group of "leaders" assembled in Quebec announced that they too do care about human needs, and therefore, have added to the FTAA a clause that says that only "democracies" can participate in the Free Trade Area.

Of course, we know this clause was put in simply as a distraction, because the whole purpose of the FTAA, along with NAFTA and the WTO is to side-step democracy. Multi-national corporations that profit by exploiting workers, busting unions, putting smaller local stores out of business, ruining the environment, and endangering public safety don't like local "democratic" laws that make it more difficult to do these things. Therefore, they use these global trade agreements to help overturn local democratically-enacted
laws. (For more information about why the FTAA is harmful, visit
http://www.stopftaa.org)

The Proposal:
Nonetheless, why not use their so-called claim for Democracy to help challenge the FTAA? The United States clearly is NOT a democracy, by any of a wide number of measures. Therefore, we should mount a united, transnational campaign to get the United States expelled from FTAA due to
its violation of the democracy clause. This effort should involve all of those who are being hurt by "free trade," as well as all of those who are unhappy with the fact that the US is not a democracy, and would like to use this issue to draw attention to that fact. If the US were out of the FTAA, then the agreement would collapse (or change into something much less threatening).

WHY THE US IS NOT A DEMOCRACY:
- Complex ballot access rules that prevent third parties from competing equally, therefore preventing democracy by allowing only corporate-backed candidates to serve in government (for example, in many states, a Republican or Democrat candidate can automatically have their name put on the ballot, but a candidate for any other party must collect thousands of signatures -- violating the basic premise of democracy being an open & fair competition).
- Bizarre rules from our past that give the Presidency to the candidate who lost the popular vote, rules that are still used today despite modern communication technology that makes them unnecessary. (This system, the "electoral college" is also connected to the problem of racial injustice, since the system gives preferential weight to the votes in sparsely-populated, predominantly white states).
- Pervasive, blatant discrimination against people of color, including the recently documented exclusion of tens of thousands of African American voters in Florida. These voting rights violations included everything from demanding multiple forms of ID from African American (but not white) voters, to falsely accusing thousands of African Americans of being felons, and therefore not allowed to vote, to the fact that rickety old malfunctioning voting machines are disproportionately located in low-income areas and communities of color, while affluent and white communities disproportionately receive fancy new voting equipment that doesn't have any "chad" problems.
- Many more problems with the US electoral system, such as the heavy corporate funding of elections that prevents a level playing field and subverts the spirit of democracy. (I imagine most people reading this will think of a few more reasons why the US is not a "real" democracy).

So, how about it? Are you (or an organization you are involved with) interested in working to demand that the US be expelled from the FTAA for not being a "democracy?". Think about it..

Now here's a shameless piece of not quite promotional hustling by ME, in
that I'm forwarding on this appraisal of my magazine by CANDICE, which was
posted to the Imitations list earlier today.

david bircumshaw

from C.Ward as follows:


Apologies for cross-posting (don't you love the way everybody apologizes for
this, then goes right on doing it?). But I want to tout the first issue of A
CHIDE'S ALPHABET on account of its spectacularly consistent
spectacularity--not a ringer in the lot unless it's one of mine (how would I
know?)--and to encourage listees to order it from David Bircumshaw so that
he  doesn't get depressed and stop putting it out. After spending a couple
of hours pleasurably immersed in its 40-odd pages, I think it would be a
bargain at twice the price (even free-squared!), if only for the dazzling
arrays of  Emma Lew and Trevor Joyce poems--a nice big chunk of each, and
Joyce's
brilliant, sustained use of repetition in the 3 "lattice" poems invites
their repeated rereading--plus a good-sized, well-varied selection of lyrics
and longer poems by Alison Croggon. The Robin Hamilton sampler here displays
his trademark wit, and I was pleased to make the acquaintance of Welsh poet
Ian Davidson, whose work I didn't know at all. The issue is nicely framed by
editor Bircumshaw's "Modest Introduction" (with an amusingly breezy
acknowledgments statement) and a nice mix of poet Bircumshaw's new and
older, cryptically encrypted poems.
 The single, relatively brief poem by Randolph Healy here is one on which I
could spend hours happily puzzling out its fittings: 5 senses, 7 locks
holding  7 broken keys (a chromosomal image with an allusion to the Seven
Sleepers?), 4 tastes, 4 odors, a robbery, a birth, a case of lordosis(?),
and a race with time--all contextualized to a right triangle sided by
difference and identity, "joined" by a dying star. The poem's entitled
"Flight." Go figure.

 Well, I could go on, but won't, and just hope I've whetted your appetites
for
 A CHIDE'S ALPHABET.

Can anyone help? I heard a poet read this line 30 years ago:

"I held your head in my hands as if it were a delicate bowl."

It was my very first poetry reading. Took place at Ohio University ca.
1970-71. The poet may have been British. He had lank black hair, wore a
black turtleneck with gray jacket.

I haven't a clue as to who he was.

Anybody?

2. Clark Park Arts/ music Festivals, June 23rd and Sept. 29th, free!

From: rich wexler <gypsyboots2001@yahoo.com>
Subject: Looking for Artist/ Community Groups to set up at Clark Park
Music Arts community fests.

Hey Y'all,

I am putting together artist/crafters/community group
tables at Clark Park Arts/ music Festivals. they are
June 23rd and Sept. 29th. It will be free to all who
want a table. It is my intention to build up a large
showing of quality art/craft/ community group showing
at the Festivals.  We have a very active artistic/
organizational community that should have it work shown.

Here is the deal and requirements.

A. In terms of Art/Crafts, they must be handmade by
the artists (or if its a group you can show others
work) No beanie babies please ! ok, maybe the tye-dye
ones. (Just kidding)

B. Please let me know what kind of work you are
selling so I can add info. into the program booklet.
Please include contact numbers, email. etc. If you
want to place a card in program booklet that would
cost (i believe $25) I want to include a list of
artist etc. I also don't want to have to much of the
same type of items.

C. Provide your own table. If you cannot, let me know
maybe I should work out sharing tables etc.

D. I don't want to censor any work but please remember
there are kids present , so keep risky items out ofchildrens sight.

E. I need final confirmation asap if you want to be
included in program booklet.

Please forward this to anyone else that may be
interested. Call for more info. 215-222-2816

3. An 'Evening of Collaboration Between Poets and Artists=92, 6/3, 4-7pm

You are invited to participate in a unique evening of collaboration and
connection between Philadelphia-area poets and artists on Sunday, June 3,
from 4 - 7 pm, at Nexus Gallery in Old City (137 N. 2nd Street, Philadelphia=
).

In the spirit of a 1960s happening, visitors to the exhibition by sculpture
artists Keiko Miyamori and Carole Sivin will be invited to type their
responses and comments on typewriters that form part of the artwork.

Later in the evening, from 6 - 7 pm, local poets Deidra Greenleaf Allan,
Herschell Baron, Elaine Terranova, and Justin Vitiello will create a poem
collaboratively from the written responses of the visitors and also read fro=
m=20
their own work.

Both the sculpture and the composed poem will reflect aspects of Japanese=20
culture. Miyamori, who is Japanese, and Sivin, who has exhibited her work in=
=20
Kyoto and Tokyo, will exhibit works that incorporate Japanese paper. The poe=
m=20
created jointly by the four writers will follow the technique of traditional=
=20
Japanese Renga or linked verse, in which poets compose a poem sequentially,=20
each contributing a stanza that responds to earlier ones.

For a fun evening that celebrates the connections between the visual and
literary arts, join us at Nexus on June 3.

Havent a clue. But are you being cruel? Are you going to upbraid the
poet, 30 years later, for such a lousy line?

at only 100- or 200x, the microscope, examining filter effluvia from the
aquarium, reveals a world of life around the feeder dead brine shrimp:
numerous protista, worms of various sorts, rotifera. some of my favorite -
stentor, amoeba, various ciliates, for example. lots of blue-green algae,
disconnected cells. too tired to identify the ciliates or worms, but think
at least some are nematodes. all of these are relatively small - the
amoeba is by far the largest (even though some of the others are mutli-
cellular); here's a whole other buried ecology. there are similar ones at
the bottom of the tank, beneath the artificial rock, among the crevices
between the pebbles, on the tank sides - in fact anywhere there's a
surface or hold-fast domain. the pebbles, fossils, and artificial rock,
all have miniscule worms, possibly tubularia.

all this is to say a repetition of the basic lesson: that larger life-
forms are relatively transparent, planetary, to organisms on this scale,
that our cognition means absolutely nothing, that we are floating harbors
of nourishment, that life has a persistence having nothing to do with
vertebra, intelligence, even sexuality. these organisms and their like
inhabit our surfaces, our gut, our tear-ducts, our excrement, our very
cells, our dna, our sequences, major and minor, our redundancies. we are
no more visible to them as we are to neutrino flooding. we live in the
great slosh, and you need only a microscope to see it. von Foerster, i
think, talks about negation as a primary characteristic of organisms in
general, a defining characteristic - and watching these *zoa, avoidive
behavior on all levels is clear; afterwards, i return them to the tank.
think of it this way: bits and bytes and protocols surround us; we're
invaded on the level of informatics by computer and other, more basic,
viruses - those which characterize digital behavior and phenomenology in
general. and "just so," we're invaded as well on the level of material
physiology by equally invisible organisms; even our culture and speech
(for that matter) are transparent; we're transparent through and through,
communalities flooding these very words i write, you read.

NOW AVAILABLE, second in this season of TERRA NOVA Books:


WRITING ON WATER

Edited by David Rothenberg and Marta Ulvaeus

A Terra Nova Book


Water links all aspects of our existence.  From the politics of
watersheds to the romance of turtles climbing up from the sea, from =
Leonardo
da Vinci to Octavio Paz, from murder at a hot spring to the cool facts =
on
liquidation, the writings in this collection flow through all the ways
humans encounter this most refreshing of elements.

There is a bit of science, some management plans for the protection of
water, and plenty of stories, poems, essays, and photography.

"Here is a fresh way of looking at one of the oldest subjects there is.
Wide-ranging, eclectic, and exciting, the pages contain wild energy.  I
don=B9t know of another anthology anything like this."
                               Gary Lawless, poetry editor, Wild Earth

"A reader=B9s heart is beating harder when this volume=B9s farther =
shore is
reached."

TERRA NOVA BOOKS aim to show how environmental issues have cultural and

combine essays, reportage, fiction, art, and poetry to reveal the
complex and paradoxical ways the natural and the human are continually
redefining each other.

ANSWER TO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION


( Behind this text is the phenomenological structure of truth.

"Speech is subsumption architecture drawn out by conflicted local environ-
ments, with the symbol responsive, not to communality, but to the split-
ting of the referent. Normal speech is a reduction to filtered, edited
meaning; the resulting singularity is a result of the temporal linearity
in our perceptual universe. Full speech is schizophrenic, dangerous,
pulling in too much environment, too little processing and filtering; it
disturbs the fundamental order of the subject. Full truth is equivalent
and irreducible; what passes for truth, passes by virtue of the table,
communality, convention. Everything begins with the referent, tied to
human survival, processed and already demarcated prior to name, syntax,
semantics. Semantics subsumes subsumption, creating a phenomenology as if
we perceive, inhabit the real. Naive realism is its masquerade."

Mentor Huebner

My husband, Mentor Huebner, died March 19.  He was an artist. A Post
Impressionist Painter.  He was a Motion Picture Production Illustrator,
Designer, Conceptual Artist, "Ghost Designer," Choreographer of
Complicated Film Sequences, Conceptual Story Board Artist. He worked on
250 Feature Films, helped to design 10 Theme Parks (Warner's Theme Park in
Australia he was the only Artist), and he had 50 One Man Solo Art Exhibits
of his work. The Smithsonian Museum, Washington, DC, and the Museum of
Modern Art, New York City, each featured his work in traveling national
exhibits (three years each), the Native Sons of the Golden West Museum had
an exhibit for five years, daily. He has received numerous awards and
citations for his contribution to World-Art.  The City of Los Angeles
Council adjourned in his honor to commemorate his death.  He is considered
to be a genius and an Icon in the industry and known to be the last Post
Impressionist Painter of the 20th Century.

Some of his films range from Ben Hur to Blade Runner, from A Star is Born
to The Planet of the Apes...

He designed all the vehicles in The Great race, the entire City in Blade
Runner; the now very famous Crop Plane chase of Cary Grant in North By
Northwest...

He is Cofounder of a group for the advancement of culture in Los Angeles:
The Mount Washington Poets and Artists Back Yard Conservancy.

A scholarship in his memory has been established to help less fortunate
artists, "The Mentor Huebner Memorial Art Awards"

Mentor has followers around the world.

Sort of a cult following.

Thank you.

Richard,

I am sorry for the delayed reply. You quoted me wrongly. I did not say
"inherently boring." I said a language poet claimed (his words): "poetry can
be legitimately boring." That is, I suppose, boredom (even by an intelligent
reader) is a right of the poet. Well, I don't think so.

THE PASSION ACCORDING TO G.H.

_after Clarice Lispector_

The night cuts across us like a vibrating pin
And we dissolve into our private eyesores
As snowflakes on a great, lolling tongue

Bleating from a far-off, far-off fog. More
Like St. Paul than not, we are crafty
And full of certainty. Like him, we make our

Own Damascus. This is why I still carry
My suitcase, shot through with ultimatums
And wedded to fissures of starlight and empty.

Yet I live in a violent world and I am in love
_Lemonade, everything was so infinite_
While colorless green ideas sleep furiously on.

So be still my molten heartstrings;
I will continue my song.
I will continue my song in the name of nothing

But a glittering metastasis that hatches a chitin moon
Into a blood tide--a lighted, fuzzy, six-legged thing
That bears and bears alone.


Wanda Phipps is the author of the chapbooks Your Last Illusion or Break
Up Sonnets (Situations) and Lunch Poems (BoogLit). Her poems have been

Comments: cc: davidi@wizard.net
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear Poetics-ers,

long time no e.  Am writing to advise of an experimental digital video =
collective project in progress, and invite contributions from any fitted =
out w/ the gear & inclined towrad the exercise.

The notion of "digital haiku" (a digital video correlate, if not to say =
interpretation, of the classical Japanese 3-liner form) was proposed by =
one Mark Palmer, video artist in Berkeley, and has been discussed =
ongoingly (at some length) over the past couple months by denizens of the =
Cinema Electronica discussion forum (a forum moderated by American =
expatriot [living in Rome] independent filmmaker-turned-DV-maven Jon Jost, =
and hosted by the www.dv.com website).

The site for the Digital Haiku project (with some details & guidelines-- =
chief of which are: 1. video works are to be not longer than 60-seconds in =
length; and [to paraphrase], 2. are intended to embody [in whatever manner =
you can imagine, propose, muster, or chance upon] the haiku (transmorgafied=
 into another kettle of fish, obviously)--- is here:
http://www.encapsulated.net/digitalhaiku/

Generally folks are not using words, though the use of those has not been =
proscribed; the tendency among people trying this, so far, has been to try =
to find a way to work with the given medium (which is primarily visual, =
though also of course auditory) in a way that proves analogous . . . or =
something . . . and actually, this has devolved into consideration of the =
5/7/5 syllable count and a proposed equivalency with 500 frames 700 frames =
500 frames (in NTSC)-- approx. 13 sec. / 23 sec / 13 sec, for three =
segments of a 57-second digital haiku.

Perhaps more detail than strictly requisite, above; but you can read about =
it more here:
http://www.dv.com/db_area/community/Forum13/HTML/000084.html
and here:
http://www.dv.com/db_area/community/Forum13/HTML/000155.html
and, in general, on threads here:
http://www.dv.com/db_area/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=3Dtopics&forum=3D=
Cinema+Electronica&number=3D13&DaysPrune=3D60&LastLogin=3D

cheers,
david raphael israel
davidi@wizard.net=20

p.s.:  both an NTSC and a PAL version (on miniDV) are planned as formats =
for anthology reels of digital haiku.  The first reel (or volume) is of =
spring haiku (currently in progress), with deadline of June 20; but fret =
not, summer digital haiku should follow apace.

Dear Poetics-ers,

small erratum! - not meaning to mislead, where I wrote,

<< consideration of the 5/7/5 syllable count and a proposed equivalency =
with 500 frames 700 frames 500 frames (in NTSC)-- approx. 13 sec. / 23 sec =

that should be, 17 sec. / 23 sec. / 17 sec.
(for one proposed way of translating syllabic ratios into video-pacing of =
a 57-sec. digital haiku) . . .

thx, d.i.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Stop Harmful Low Frequency Active Sonar

----------------------

The National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed
issuing a permit that would allow the Navy to move
ahead with plans to flood as much as 80 percent of
the world's oceans with intense noise -- harassing,
injuring, or even killing marine mammals in the process.
The Fisheries Service permit would give the Navy the
go-ahead to deploy Low Frequency Active Sonar, or LFA
-- a new extended-range submarine detection system
that would introduce into the world's oceans noise
billions of times more intense than that known to disturb
large whales.

Whales use their exquisitely sensitive hearing to follow
migratory routes, locate one another over great distances,
find food and care for their young. Noise that undermines
their ability to hear can threaten their ability to
function and survive. A Navy investigation has established
with virtual certainty that a naval battle group using
active sonar caused a mass stranding of whales and
dolphins in the Bahamas in March 2000. At least seven
of the whales died, with all but one suffering hemorrhages
in the inner ear, almost certainly the result of a
sonic blast. And last month it was reported that one
of the whale species that stranded in the Bahamas has
virtually disappeared from the area.

The Fisheries Service is accepting public comments
through May 31, 2001, on whether to grant the Navy's
LFA permit request. Tell the service to deny the Navy's
permit.

This Action Alert is in support to an overall campaign
led by our partners from the Natural Resources Defense
Council, Ocean Sanctity and the Ocean Mammal Institute.

ballad:

this morning i did catch the eyes of god
it's huge and yellow under blue-grey lids
unexpected, everything so there and bright
it looked like night would look without the skids

there's far too much to see, too much to taste
in this world gone white, far too many things
unexpected, all things there, a sight
that needs the shuddered blackness without wings

to load it dreary down, focus my thought, my speech,
so each to each, nothing left but light
applied to one and then another and then beseeched
and done without the blight of too much light

coda:

in blackness thought thinks light; god's eyes
blind humans from the light; speech ties
words to things and things to words; light flies
from them; speech cries

I/we would be curious to see some samples.  Anything in print, uploaded,
sendable?

The only thing that's delaying me from following up previous posts with
examples (of mine) or illustrations from Language poets (Howe mainly,
some Doris, etc.) is this mend to my left middle finger injury.

Yes, middle-of-the-roading faces much more preposterous publication
possibilities than either "side," I think.  Sort of like one of those
birdlings that fall out of a tree, that if a human touches it to try to
save it then sets it back in the wild ("Born Free"), the other birds
will peck it to death--- because it has the foreign scent on it.

You should become a member (JOIN! always JOIN! avoid separateness and
OUTSIDER-ishness!).

Here's one that's handy,just because it's conveniently on disk, etc.  (I
generally would avoid posting unpublished poetry directly to the EPC,--- but in
this case I'm not doing well at figuring out how to illustrate this point,
otherwise.  ...Totally buried in over-kill, having done scansions on Susan
Howe's entire "Pierce Arrow," sifting verse meters for rewarding commonalities.
Pages upon pages of empirical data.)

How "Language"-ish/asyntactical this example is is of course a presumptuousness
for hardcore Language victors to curl a lip at.  (I now consider myself in
general a would-be but FAILED experimentalist, an experimentalist ~maudit.~
Never quite had what it took, got it right.) (For the most part, I consider
parallel lines to have converged and two roads to have met, if the texture of a
reconditely ~complex~ thought, over-intricately phrased, is as equivalently
impassable as a Language line constructed purely for non-representational
opacity without such beneath-the-surface intraconnectivity.  I.e., Wallace
Stevens: "A great order is a disorder."/"A great disorder is an order.")
Sufficiently asyntac', though, for a very aghast reply from a classicist
neighbor I know from church, who I hopefully sent this mania to, once---  Hope
to dredge his sputtering bewilderment out of my papers soon, as postscript.
("...and these lines here: they don't even make sense!") Comical, too, that he
sent it on blank greeting card paper with Blessed Virgin Mary sticker on the
rose-colored envelope, assumed into heaven.  (Spontaneous Post Office civil
servant conversions.)

The writing is what it claims to be: excerpts from Greek drama "WRIT IN ITS
ORIGINAL METER FOR THE FIRST TIME."  I didn't quite understand how amphitheater
acoustics work, at the time (since then, I've learned that there are "natural"
amphitheaters and, from first-hand Middle East tourist's report, that the voice
of one standing at the epicenter of amphitheater can be heard perfectly all
around in "bleachers"), so I assumed that most of the Greek would be hard to
hear, anyway.  I figured that the ~parsing~ might be muffled, but that the ~word
order~ would come through distinct,--- so I followed word order scrupulously as
a main "rule."

I. PYTHIA

divine, the goddess primal named within my prayer
prognosticator, Mother Earth, and Justice next
she who, where Earth once ~ex cathedra~ sat enthroned
and prophesied, say stories.  Then the third descent
by destiny consented; no one had compelled--
a Titan, chthonian child took her chair the throne

II PARODOS

alas sisters how alas O we writhe
so much to suffer all for nothing selfish me

III APOLLO

I'll never leave you.  Till the end, your bodyguard
oath sworn to stay nearby and faraway, aloof
.............................................................
right now unwashed madwomen crowd all sides - you look -
asleep.  Aghast, what spat upon and drooling girls,
one eye among them childish hags, untouched, unloved:
no gods impregnate, men avoid, no beast will mount
born ~for~ the hell of evil, deaf to wrong and right
the shadows homey Tartarus below the ground
miasmas foul both men and holy mountain.  So,
likewise, escape if possible. Faint-hearted, no.
They'll stalk your lone footsteps, remote mainlands, beyond
astride for all time over printmarks stamped in soil
across the open sea and city walls of sea
But do not weary, despite the neverending day's
travail.  Depart: Athena's city lies ahead
Be seated there, embrace her ancient, carven form
Another world: ours, jurymen, and sorcery,
................................................................
to bring about your manumission, freed from flight . . .

Sundrift

"Oh, no," Beth sighed. "There must be something intrinsically wrong."

She was spending her morning seeking out red meat alternatives, but
was not above spending a moment or two worrying about insolvent banks,
unwanted body hair, and the urgent need for volunteers to man a local
runaway hotline.

Her piano stood by the window, unfingered now for many weeks. Years
before, she had learned to play the piano by a foolproof and instant method.
She'd never played before in her life, but yet, after an exciting two-hour
workshop, she was playing like a "natural." In just a few months, she'd
brought Beethoven's Diabelli Variations to a degree of polish that made
her the envy of all her peers.

Piano practice, though, had gradually been edged out by suntanning.
Ten sessions cost $60, a price she simply could not resist. That was $6
a session, she figured, her fear of math long a thing of the past, thanks to
Mathwerk, and its devoted staff of licensed teachers.

Thirty-three now, Beth had lived all her life in the city and had learned
how to take advantage of the abundant opportunities the city offered,
from support groups for small business owners to workshops for women
that would help them set goals, develop strategies and overcome limiting
ideas. She knew about and benefited from personalized lists of college
scholarships based on majors and career goals. When she wasn't getting
what she wanted, she knew that singles counseling for smart New
Yorkers was just a phone call away.

She knew that somewhere in the East Village, accompanied by New Age
music as old as Mount Sinai, Jewish mystical insights were being discussed
along with Chassidic storytelling in a very informal atmosphere.

She knew that hospital jobs for nurses, technicians, medics and housekeepers
were available and would pay up to $28.50 an hour. She knew that next
Saturday morning an anti-fur march would be held at Columbus Circle. She
knew that someone out there would pay cash for the internal telephone
directories of large companies.

The window through which Beth was gazing was cleaner than she remembered
it being, though she didn't recall cleaning it or having it cleaned. The anti-fur
march was an idea. She didn't like the fact that tiny animals were raised under
concentration-camp conditions and then slaughtered for their pelts. She thought
about marching, but before she could reach a decision the telephone rang.

"Hello?"

"Hi, is this Beth Harkness?"

"Who's calling please?"

"I'm with WXYY, we're lining up interviews for a possible radio show."

"Oh?"

The voice on the phone was friendly, and, at the same time, businesslike. The
caller seemed somehow genuine. Beth relaxed.

"We're looking for bi-coastal people to share ideas on New York versus
California living."

"Bi-coastal people?"

"Yes, people who've lived or are living on both coasts."

"There must be some mistake then."

"Oh?"

"I've never lived on the Coast."

"Really? Are you sure? Our sources are usually very reliable."

"Sorry, all I know about California I've learned from Woody Allen movies,
and you know where he stands on that question."

"Yes, indeed. In fact, he's one of the people we're hoping to interview."

"Well, good luck with your project."

"Thanks, and I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your time."

"No problem. Bye."

The phone clicked back into its cradle. Across the street, a huge sign said,
"Hemorrhoids? Have them treated in minutes with lasers. Call
1-800-MD-TUSCH." The cat leapt onto Beth's lap.

Fluffy was the cat's name, and fluff was her game. Great billows of furry
fluff blew around the small apartment on floor-level drafts. Beth reached
for her "Magic Wand" pet comb. Of all the pet gizmos Beth had accumulated
over the years, this was Fluffy's favorite. Its unique design made it easy to
handle, so Beth could comb the cat thoroughly while the cat stretched out on
her lap. It ran on just two AA batteries which Beth had purchased herself
(because they were not included in the price of the Magic Wand), and it ran
QUIETLY—no loud roar to scarify the cat. And it suctioned out dirt,
dandruff, loose hair, and even flea eggs and flea shit, as Fluffy purred in ecstasy.
By the time Fluffy had been fully combed, she'd fallen asleep on Beth's lap,
and Beth sighed, feeling chained to her desk.

"Oh, well, I should look at the mail," she thought.

It was yesterday's mail in fact, mail that Beth hadn't gotten around to opening or
looking at yet.

One brochure was for an abdomenizer, a saddle-like, blue plastic device that
Beth already owned, and hadn't used lately precisely because it had done its
work so well. The gadget, invented by one Dr. Dennis Colonell, D.C., enabled
Beth to do sit-ups that both strengthened and slimmed down her stomach
without doing damage to her back. It was wonderful, Beth thought, and her
tummy was tonier than it had been in years. She KNEW how ordinary sit-ups
could torture her tailbone, but the abdominizer maintained the ideal lumbo
sacral angle, thereby reducing pressure on her tailbone as she rocked her way
to a firmer tum.

She tossed this brochure in the trash.

Another pamphlet offered Beth something she hadn't seen before—an epilator.
The Soft Lady epilator was said to eliminate nicks, cuts and rough next-day
stubble from her legs without the hassle of messy wax and chemical systems.
Careful not to disturb the sleeping Fluffy, Beth ran one hand up and down along
her thighs and calves and ankles, imagining the sensuous softness that the Soft Lady
epilator might provide. She set this brochure aside, thinking she might place an
order by phone. As she did so, a small ad she had clipped from the Voice caught
her eye.

Elisa and Philip wanted "combatants & survivors of harrowing divorces" to call
them at (212) 788-6600. An Academy Award-winning producer of documentaries
apparently wanted such people for an upcoming docudrama.

Beth thought about this for a while. When the ad first caught her eye a week or so
ago, it brought back memories of Jason, memories she had tried long and hard to
suppress. But now, today, sitting at her desk, cat dozing on her lap, noontime sun in
her eyes, she though perhaps she could handle it.

Jason had been a prick. No doubt about it. He'd dragged their marriage through a
long, drawn-out court struggle, all because he'd wanted the cat. Beth couldn't
believe it. They had agreed on everything until they came to the cat. He got virtually
all the CDs, including the ones Beth's parents had given her on her birthdays. He
had claimed most of the books, but Beth wasn't much of a reader, so that didn't
matter. Furniture and kitchen stuff—he'd taken most of those too. Which left Beth
with a handful of third-world appliances, a desk (the one at which she was now
sitting), a futon (on which Fluffy took her non-lap naps), and a beat-up old record
player with a couple dozen black vinyl disks, mostly the Neville Brothers and a few
other things that were pre-Jason (or PJ, as she'd come to think of that period in her life).
The sun was moving from left to right as Beth dialed the number. It was later than she'd
thought. Maybe she'd been drowsing in the sun.

The number began to ring, as Beth thought about Jason, the prick. This would serve him
right.

Someone answered. "Sundrift," a voice said, soft, female, inviting.

"Could I speak to Elisa or Philip?" Beth said.

"Just a minute, please."

Beth waited, absently stroking cat's long, soft coat.

"Sorry, nobody here by that name."

"I'm confused," said Beth. "Aren't you looking for people who've been through the 'divorce
wars?'" She carefully used words from their ad.

"Sorry. We're a travel agency, and we specialize in low-cost air tickets to the Caribbean
and the Mexican Coast."

Suddenly, palm trees, white sand beaches and sparkling waters flashed before Beth's eyes.
She could feel the warm water curling up between her toes.

"The Caribbean?" was all she could say.

"Yes, St. Maarten, Trinidad, Jamaica, Barbadoes. And the Mexican Coast, don't forget—
Guaymas, Mazatlan, Acapulco. The Pacific. You know."

"Right," Beth said. She thought of the hot sun, of palm-frond cabañas, of gin and coconut
milk sipped through a straw right out of the coconut.

She had never experienced any of these things, of course, but, thanks to the photos in
travel brochures and in the travel section of the Sunday Times, the images were as sharp
as though she had.

"We can get you to Cancún for a week for $189, round-trip."

"No kidding," Beth said, amazed that the airfare could be so low. "And what's the
catch?"

"No catch at all, except that you have to fly on Tuesdays or Wednesdays."

"And the hotel?"

"Oh, we could set you up with something for about fifty or sixty a night. You know,
clean and simple—not fancy."

"No hidden costs?"

"No hidden costs."

Beth thought, and sighed. Again, she flashed on palm trees and bright waters,
dark-skinned young men frolicking in the surf.

"Well, may I call you back?"

She thought she'd better check out her finances before making a commitment.

"Please do," said the voice. "My name is Carlene, and we take Visa, Mastercard,
American Express, and Discover."

"Thanks."

"Bye."

Without thinking, Beth stood up, the startled Fluffy tumbling to the floor. She went
to her tiny kitchen and started opening doors and peering in cupboards. Somewhere
there was half-full bottle of tequila that someone once had brought to a party and
left. Beth wanted now, after all these months, to see what sort of taste that stuff had,
to see if it had the taste of Mexico about it.
