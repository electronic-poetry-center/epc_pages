New from primitive publications:
"Gravity's Mirror" by Laynie Browne

This book explores the myth and ritual of childbirth, using history and
symbolic imagery to conjure emotion and thought.  Through her choice of
language, Ms. Browne takes us to an ancient world where pregnancy and
childbirth are part of a symbolic journey, a process of growth and yearning
for what is yet to come. "Gravity's Mirror", while ethereal and beautiful,
is a strong and powerful commentary on our perceptions of birth.

This work is part of primitive publications, a press dedicated to
historically based modern writing.  Cost is $5.00, or $25 for a subscription
of six chapbooks.  All checks should be made out to Mary Hilton.

For more information, contact Mary Hilton, editor, at mhilton@aia.org.
Thank you.

Subject:      R. Barthes
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

--
I'm interested in hearing whether anyone out there has some current
thoughts about Roland Barthes, whether anyone has a particular passion one
way of the other about him, or which poets are still reading him at all.

Although in a sense I'm asking out of the blue, my question has roots in
three semi-recent events for me.

1.  Maybe folks caught Steve Evan's excellent piece on Barthes a few issues
ago in the Poetry Project newsletter?  Reconstructing from memory I recall
the ending becoming rather heated and startling as it shifted to the
assertion that Barthes is not being read very well, very fairly, or very
seriously by poets.

2.  I recently began reading Mythologies and find it really remarkable,
R.B.'s sense of humor, similarity to some of Francis Ponge, and insistent
class-based interpretations causing me to rethink my impressions of the
later works, i.e. THE PLEASURE OF THE TEXT, SADE/FOURIER/LOYOLA and ROLAND
BARTHES ON ROLAND BARTHES.  These are the only three I've completely read,
all of which I found less funny and not so explicitly
anti-petit-bourgeoise, though not to say worse. (By the way, I've read
these three books only because the used bookstore had cheap copies, which
might prove a Barthian theory of my own: texts most likely to be disliked
and sold are thus texts with the widest circulation are thus texts with the
greatest influence).

3. About a year ago I heard Kit Robinson suggest that the theoretical
enthusiasm of the Language poets circa the 1970s (excepting perhaps
Watten's formalistic obsessions) came more from Barthes than from any other
theorist or collection of theorists.  The point came up in the context of
some of the folks I've heard presumed to be among L.P.'s early
influnces--Derrida, Althusser, Foucault, Gramsci, Wittgenstein.

I have an abiding impression that, in the 1970s and 80s the Language Poets,
whoever they may or may not have been, were assumed by much of the poetry
world to have an excellent working command of continental postmodern and
Marxist literary theory chiefly because their detractors didn't know much
about such theories and didn't want to know much about them--i.e. the
elevation of the shadowed.  It is also my impression that the inflation of
that particular sign still survives (especially among those who descry
language poetry), even if by now some of the Language Poets have caught up
to their reputations as theoretical adepts.

Hope something here inspires someone to do something . . .

the coming into the learning


i am d'nala d'eruza. i am here to learn the fruitful arts of prostitution
and divination.

i was sent to you. d'eruza sent me. d'nala sent me.

i beg of you to teach me. you have knowledge i need. knowledge in the rose
of virginity, the cleanliness of the organ, the turning-shaft, burial
mound and sunlit ray. i have no desire but to learn. you will teach me. my
life has tended towards this. d'nala nurtured me; d'eruza tendered me.

i would like knowledge. i would like knowledge of perfumes and scents. i
would like knowledge of ch'in and shamisen. i would like knowledge of the
classic of rivers and mountains. i would like knowledge of the god of
death. i would like knowledge of d'nala and d'eruza.

i am alone in this. i am speechless and mute. i demand silence in my
presence. there are no fears. you must teach me the ways of prostitution
and divination. you must teach me the ways of men and women. i do not
understand you in this line of questioning.

d'nala comes to you naked. d'eruza comes to you naked. there is always
some girl and always some boy. there are always children with weapons.
there are always wounded. we have no reasons. we have no reasons. our
soliloquy is your death. but first we must learn the ways of prostitution
and shamanism.

d'nala and d'eruza have come to you naked and whole. our shafts and holes
are cleansed. we have fulfilled all the rites and obligations. we have
prepared ourselves as best we know how. we have purchased the [lacuna] and
the great storehouse [?] of clothing. we have been sent and cleansed.

we are purified and untroubled. we are d'nala and d'eruza. we have come to
learn the sacred paths of prostitution and shamanism. you are our fantas-
ies, the clothes you exhibit, the slightest taste of skin, the edge
beneath the outer sheathing, the paraphernalia of rites and prohibitions.

the ritual objects and tethered animals. the sacred mats and hairs of only
one color. the banners and winds. the ritual objects and tethered animals.
the d'nala and d'eruza.

yes, we must first learn the knowledge of prostitution and shamanism.

yes, we have offered everything to you. yes, we have come a great way.
yes, we are cleansed. yes, we are prepared. we have no desires of our own
that enter beneath the canopy of this and any other world.

we have emptied ourselves and emptied ourselves of such desires.
we have emptied ourselves and emptied ourselves of inhibitions.
we have emptied ourselves and emptied ourselves of fears.

teach us and teach us as we have been sent and cleansed.
teach us and teach us as we have come to learn the knowledge of
prostitution and shamanism.

our childhood is our command.

In memorium
Walter Matthau (Matuschanskayasky) (1920-2000)

Matthhau comes up significantly in Aram Saroyan’s novel The Street, which is
mostly about New York in the 60s; it’s a novel in which Clark Coolidge figures
prominently. Matthau was Aram’s father-in-law from the time he was 15.
        There is a classic Jewish joke, one version of which is told about Jack
Lemmon and Matthau.
        In the middle of a movie shoot, Matthau slips on the icy street and
takes a bad fall. There is much alarm. An ambulance is called and Matthau’s head
is propped up by an improvised pillow. Lemmon bends down and asks, “Walter, are
you comfortable?”
        -- “I make a good living.”

For some time I have wanted to write a brief comment on *Unquell the Dawn Now*
by Robert Kelly and Schuldt, which is most notable for Kelly's magnificent
homophonic translation of  Holderlin’s “Am Quell der Donau”. At a translation
conference at Barnard a couple of years ago, Kelly noted that he wanted to do a
completely non-comic homophonic translation, partly to show that this approach
to translation doesn't need to be funny. MacPherson & co. has published an
elaborately produced, color-coded, mutlipart edition, with a range of
translation versions beyond Kelly's initial homophonic. All in all a valuable
book for those interested in alternative modes of translation, or for that
matter interest in Holderlin's poem. Full description at

Glad to see your post on Barthes since I did something similar on Derrida a
while back.  You're right that European philosophers, culture critics, etc.,
have been grossly misprisoned in America.  Worst case is Derrida who was
nearly mediated beyond recognition by many in the Yale group.  It's also true
that language poets early on were struggling to get a handle on the
philosophy of Derrida et al.  They didn't always get it right, and there are
a few embarrassing misrepresentations and even contradictions in the
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E conversations and also in Content's Dream, for example.  But
there are two Barthes (just like there were two Wittgensteins), so I wouldn't
be surprised that he has given language poets more room to move.  Whatever
they say or do, they can probably appeal to one Barthes or another.  The
first Barthes is, of course, the structuralist who, like all structuralists,
inadvertently smuggles the idea of a very stable and grounding structure as
center into his writing, a writing that ostensibly works against such a
notion.  The second, later Barthes is the one who was completely won over by
Derrida, who accepted D's criticisms of structuralism, Saussure, etc.  In
America, as you know, ideas go in and out of fashion.  In the cases of Freud
and Sartre, however, at least there were cogent arguments mounted against the
theories.   Not so in the cases of Derrida and the later Barthes.  Americans
seem to have simply tired of thinking so hard, and have just moved on,
generally to important but facile political concerns.  In order to disprove D
and later B someone has to once again posit a convincing a priori or a
posteriori within language that doesn't break apart on examination--hasn't
happened yet.  And of course there will always be those New Critic hangovers
who want to treat the poem as sealed off from everything else, as exempt from
the process of intertextuality.  Theory is still happening in Europe,
however.  Check out Kristeva's work on de Sade, Bataille.  Bataille is
another deviant thinker whose writing has been largely ignored or mismanaged
in America.  Best, Bill

Brent,

  Yes, I do have strong feelings about Barthes, but they may not be in the=20
direction you may be going. I think Barthes is the Marrano among the French=20
intellectuals (and writers). He is a gay writer who makes absolutely no=20
references (as far as I know) to his gayness in the work published during hi=
s=20
life time. His startling Moroccon journal in pursuit of boys (roughly=20
corresponding in time to his writing of "Fourrier," a Utopia of uninterrupte=
d=20
pleasure) and his Paris journal (its last entry coming just before his=20
suicide) were published posthumously (in a book entitled, I think,=20
"Incidents" in English). While alive, Barthes berated the viability of the=20
journal as a writing form.=20

   How does such an essential aspect of his being not creep into Barthes's=20
writing? I think in his earlier writing Barthes is the perfect well-behaved=20
boy (one should not forget, Barthes's academic background was provincial, no=
t=20
100% "comme il faut"). His essays in "Mythologies" and other semiotic=20
writings are brilliant extrapolations from already established ideas. In the=
m=20
he says nothing that will disturb any of his intellectual friends.

   Inklings of subversion in Barthes start in a few pages of "The Pleasure o=
f=20
the Text," in which he confesses the chaotic, irrational pleasure he takes i=
n=20
certain passages (reading Fourrier, I think) -a deep and arbitrary pleasure=20
which is the true reason why he reads these books and which has no connectio=
n=20
to anything surrounding them in the text.

   Semiotics is a system of replete explanations. Everything is explained an=
d=20
absorbed into a system of language, denying any existence outside (Barthes's=
=20
book on Balzac, "S/Z," is a reductive specimen of that).=20

   Barthes's confession denies the viability of this system because it=20
confesses to something outside (non-semiotic!). The boldness of these few=20
pages have essentially been ignored because they are surrounded by the usual=
=20
jargon of the tribe in the rest of the book, which obfuscates it.

   Barthes didn't make an open break -internal and external- with his=20
academic milieu. A lot of his writing is marred by an archness which makes=20
his work a pain in the ass for me to read sometimes. Nevertheless, a=20
relatively few of his essays blaze new paths, open new possibilities. These=20
essays, which acted as sparks for my thinking and writing, are the following=
:=20
"Fourrier," "Loyola," some of the essays in the book "The Responsibility of=20
Forms," particularly the ones on Eisenstein's still photographs ("The Third=20
Meaning"), on Cy Twombly ("Cy Twombly: Works on Paper"), on Ert=E9 ("Ert=E9,=
 or A=20
la lettre") and on the painter Arcimboldo ("Arcimboldo, or Magician and=20
Rhetoriqueur') and, for its photographs only, his "Barthes on Barthes."

   Bert, I suppose, for you, all these essays are "petit bourgeois." Whateve=
r=20
they may be, they are radically different from his earlier writing, for whic=
h=20
you seem to feel nostalgic.

   In the above listed essays, Barthes explores a connection between the eye=
=20
and the word as a new path to perception (an essential point of his "Loyola"=
=20
essay is that Loyola substitutes the eye for the ear as the primary organ of=
=20
spiritual truth). Something experienced as through a conjunction between the=
=20
eye and words is outside semiotics -the space where the unnameable lives.=20
Barthes sees photography as the radical medium of this new perception, what=20
he calls "the third meaning"; "the third meaning" is a Molotov cocktail he=20
throws among his academic writings.

   My essay, "The Peripheral Space of Photography," expands Barthes's hint=20
that photography is the radical medium of the repressed -of the=20
disenfranchized experience. For anyone interested, the essay will be=20
published by Sun & Moon's in its Green Integer series this year.

   In my review, " "Ed Friedman's 'Mao & Matisse': A Decorative Poetics:=20
Pleasure, Ideas and Rebellion," I explore the possibilities of decoration as=
=20
a medium of philosophy, politics and poetry. The seeds of this idea are in=20
Barthes' piece on Ert=E9, how Ert=E9 turns letters into decorative objects.=20=
This=20
review is appearing in the most recent issue of the webzine "Big Bridge," in=
=20
the Fiction section. For anyone interested, the address is: www.bigbridge.or=
g.

   My poem "Io's Song" is based on the necessity of the reader's involvement=
=20
through his or her eye, by meditating on the relationship of words in the=20
space of the page. The reader must choose in which direction he or she will=20
move through the poem. This element of choice is also an essential element i=
n=20
Loyola's spiritual meditations.  A selection from "Io's Song" and my specifi=
c=20
reading of it are in the Cd-Rom issue of "The Little Magazine" (volume 21).

   I am very happy with Brent's throwing down the gauntlet in regards to=20
Barthes, though I suspect we'll end up on the opposite sides of any=20
discussion. Nevertheless, I think Barthes is a seminal (though ambivalent)=20
figure in discussing the possibilities of any future in poetry. I hope many=20
more poets join the discussion.

        Have often wondered at the obituary nature of many poetics posts.

        (is there a "plot" afoot?)


        as was remarked of Rimbaud:  "dead at twenty, buried at 37"

        what are the interrelationships among posthumous lives--
        and posthumous poetries?

        sometimes for example "ars longa, vita brevis" is
         reversed

        "yesterday" in the forwarded post from "subterraneans" list below,
                  was 29 june 2000.

Hey, poetics list guys, I thought that the reason we had to put up
with all the delays on the poetics list and other administrative
hassles was because the list was Moderated.  If you're going to allow
us to be submitted to these endless misogynistic and homophobic
attacks, then why not just make it an open list?

This kind of offensiveness is uncalled for, and women and gays on the
list should not have to be subjected to this.  This is not about
poetry.  This is hate speech.  It seems that all the discussion of
making this the list safe place for women that E. Treadwell
introduced was wasted bandwidth.

Apologies for cross-posting - Alan


This is from the trAce online writing community, which is holding a
conference called Incubation next week in Nottingham, England - and
on the Net. The subtitle is "A trAce International Conference on
Writing and the Internet."

We are hosting a live chat as well as a Webboard (chat board) for
discussion - please visit and join if you have the time and inclin-
ation.

Thanks, Alan (sondheim@panix.com)

(from Sue Thomas, director trAce)


TrAce has opened a temporary board for Incubation, the conference on Writing
& the Internet taking place in Nottingham, UK, from 10-12 July 00.
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/~incubation  <http://trace.n>

Hosted by Alan Sondheim, it is a place for quick-fire talk and includes a
live discussion on Tuesday 11th July from 21.30-22.30pm BST to which all are
invited to contribute.

The live discussion forms a 'scratch' conference organised for Incubation
where delegates are invited to contribute a 5 minute position paper. In a
feat of human strength and agility we will attempt to scribe these
discussions into a chatroom and convey your responses back. Flesh to flesh
via the wires. Perhaps it will all be too much and our minds will explode,
or maybe we will just have a very fast conversation.

So if you want to take part at a leisurely pace, log on to
http://hum-webboard.ntu.ac.uk/~incubation
<http://hum-webboard.ntu.ac.uk/~incubation>  and get involved in the
discussions. You can subscribe by email to each individual conference if you
prefer.

But if you want to type dangerously, or watch others twisting themselves
into knots trying to be flesh and virtual at the same time, join IRC channel
#Incubation at hum-webboard.ntu.ac.uk:7000 or log on to
http://hum-webboard.ntu.ac.uk/~incubation
<http://hum-webboard.ntu.ac.uk/~incubation>  and click Chat  on Tuesday 11th
July at 21.30 BST for some high speed talk moderated and provoked by Alan
Sondheim.

<< Brent,


  Yes, I do have strong feelings about Barthes, but they may not be in the

direction you may be going. I think Barthes is the Marrano among the French

intellectuals (and writers). He is a gay writer who makes absolutely no

references (as far as I know) to his gayness in the work published during his

life time. His startling Moroccon journal in pursuit of boys (roughly

corresponding in time to his writing of "Fourrier," a Utopia of uninterrupted

pleasure) and his Paris journal (its last entry coming just before his

suicide) were published posthumously (in a book entitled, I think,

"Incidents" in English). While alive, Barthes berated the viability of the

journal as a writing form.


   How does such an essential aspect of his being not creep into Barthes's

writing? I think in his earlier writing Barthes is the perfect well-behaved

boy (one should not forget, Barthes's academic background was provincial, not

100% "comme il faut"). His essays in "Mythologies" and other semiotic

writings are brilliant extrapolations from already established ideas. In them

he says nothing that will disturb any of his intellectual friends.


   Inklings of subversion in Barthes start in a few pages of "The Pleasure of

the Text," in which he confesses the chaotic, irrational pleasure he takes in

certain passages (reading Fourrier, I think) -a deep and arbitrary pleasure

which is the true reason why he reads these books and which has no connection

to anything surrounding them in the text.


   Semiotics is a system of replete explanations. Everything is explained and

absorbed into a system of language, denying any existence outside (Barthes's

book on Balzac, "S/Z," is a reductive specimen of that).

 >>

I know Murat's commentary was meant for you, Brent, but if I may chime in.  I
have enormous respect for Murat's productions and do not intend to agree or
disagree with him here.  But I do wish to point out that love, whether homo
or hetero, does not escape conceptualization for us.  Love is a subsemiotics
within the larger field of language.  It is a word, an idea.  The chemistry
such as it is only becomes known to us with the field.  One might suggest, in
fact, that where hetero love conceals the operation of differance (not
escaping it, of course) homo eroticism/love is perhaps more evocative of the
unity that is disunity (iteration and all that).  So in that sense the
pursuits of Barthes, Foucault, Derrida--the writing--"intertexts" with the
homo erotic all the time.  No need for Barthes to focus on the subject,
unless he wants to--and he generally didn't want to for reasons Murat no
doubt has identified correctly.  Different time, different dangers.  Still I
don't quite get how anyone can know which intellectuals will or will not be
disturbed by anything anyone says.  That's reaching I think.  But Murat knows
his stuff.  oh well.  Take care.  Best, Bill

I agree, it IS hate speech.  It also has an element of unconscious irony
some might find almost deliciously ridiculous.  But then, how far should one
be "allowed" to go - and I'm not referring to Mr. Dillon, here, but rather
to one purporting to be "moderating" a List - in a glossary use of insult in
order to reach a "satisfying" level of ironic enjoyment?  I mean, free
speech being clearly out, or at least outre, why is this guy still on the
list?  Kent's posts were at least witty, engaging and topical, as were in
fact most usually those of Gabriel Gudding.  So what about Dillon's post -
what's "significant" enough about hate speech that it deserves in any sense
Equal Time - with anybody?  Yeah, I know, use the "delete" button.  Okay.
But maybe Dillon should be in some wise encouraged to go vent instead to his
barber ...

This kind of offensiveness is uncalled for, and women and gays on the
list should not have to be subjected to this.  This is not about
poetry.  This is hate speech.  It seems that all the discussion of
making this the list safe place for women that E. Treadwell

Sigh!  Haven't we been down this road?  No censorship!! The comments Dodie
references may be everything she says they are, but if the commentators are
muscled into silence, we all lose.  The only sort of list, or society, worth
having is an open one.  This is a good list, warts and all.  And we all know
that aesthetic considerations suggest ideological ones.  Imagine!  Shielding
artists from an imperfect world!  Personally I like to know these guys are
out there, if they are, and they are.  Safety?!!? What good is the ole' false
sense of security, when it's FALSE?  Art has never been about comfort--not
meaningful, experimental, rock the boat art, anyway.  And you never know;
it's possible that when someone accuses Hillary of causing Gulliani's
prostate cancer (cuckoo!), someone else will think twice about the company he
keeps.  Maybe not.  Up to him.  Poetics anyone?

Yes.  Strange that this viciousness is tolerated while Kent Johnson is
removed for expressing a preference for somebody other than Langpo's.  What
is that all about?

Brent,

In that Barthes wants to stop taking things for granted, wanting to bracket
or suspend considerations of their function, and concentrate rather on what
they mean and how they function as signs, makes him essential to our work.

After all, isn't our work the questioning of the observable, the manifest,
the taking a closer look at that which gets taken for granted, bringing to
awareness what we're in the main unaware of?

Yes, I believe his work still can figure into ours.

Best,

Gerald

Hate speech?  No more than your speech when you start to inquire into the
presumed conservative political affiliations of the women on femmesoul.com.
You just can't take effective satire.  As your colleague told me, "Get used
to it."  You just can't fathom writers who might be inspired by a Patriotism
you reject in your quest for a One World Socialist Government paid for until
their broke by American Taxpayers who do not understand your deconstruction
of their culture poetry.

And Jonathan Swift practiced "hate speech."  And William Burroughs, my old
associate from Naropa, practiced "hate speech."  As well as Camille Paglia.
What you prefer is that Ventriloquist Dummy alpha male, Dan "The Frequency"
Rather.  What you prefer is the hate speech you like to hear: Anne
Waldman's beauty salon quartet deconstructions of the male gender and paeans
to hermaphroditism.  If the shoe fits, the shoe fits.

I didn't hire Naomi Wolf to teach A. Armand ("The Hammer") Gore how to give
away the Panama Canal, our nuclear weapons secrets, super anthracite coal
reserves in Utah, the George Washington One Dollar Bill while winning the
women's vote. (Actually he's losing the women's vote because most women know
the score, and the score is that Gore's a loser

because GORE WANTS TO WIN BY TELLING YOU WANT HE THINKS YOU WANT TO HEAR,
which means that if he wrote poetry, satire, jokes, literary criticism,
ecological "Mail Bomber" philosophy, you would be rooting him on.

Look, you do not have to read the posts this reporter launches.  Your
problem is that they make good reading.

i agree w/ dodie, though i'd just been disgustedly deleting, wanting to
preserve at least a shred of goodwill toward those who were sending these
posts ( i.e. if i didn't read it, maybe they hadn't really said it).  but i
am amazed that this is going on.  please take your discussions backchannel,
or desist.

e-poetry 2001

An International Digital Poetry Festival

April 18-21, 2001, Buffalo, New York, USA

------------------------------------------------------

Dear List Member,

I'd like to announce an exciting event to be held in Buffalo in Spring,=
 2001.

"E-POETRY, 2001: An International Digital Poetry Festival" will be the first
convocation of digital poets and artists to focus on the state of art of
digital poetry. The conference will bring together practitioners who have
never
before appeared together in the same program. We expect participants from
countries such as Brazil, the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
Norway, Russia, Japan, and Australia, in addition to Canada and the U.S. The
festival will focus on works in networked and programmable media,
kinetic/visual works, hypertext, and multiple practices in digital media.

Featured poets will read, perform, and exhibit works that currently define=
 the
state of the art in digital poetries. An emphasis will be made on presenting
internationally influential practitioners whose contributions have yet to be
publicly recognized in the US. This will be the first presentation of such
works in this range and depth in a single venue.=20

The festival will take place over three and a half days. Pre-conference=
 events
on the afternoon of the 18th will inaugurate the conference. Then, from the
19-21st, there will be three full days of morning and afternoon panels
highlighted by featured readings in the afternoons and evenings. Panels and
round table discussions will provide the opportunity for digital
practitioners,
scholars, and electronic editors/publishers to engage in conversations on
crucial, controversial, and/or critical questions about these evolving=
 forms.

Though digital poetry has been part of other digital conferences, "E-POETRY,
2001: An International Digital Poetry Festival" promises to be an historic
literary event since it will be the first festival devoted exclusively to=
 this
emerging form of literary practice so crucial to the 21st century. We hope=
 it
will prove a landmark literary event as well as a coming of age event for
current practice of digital poetry.

Please set aside these dates in your calendar and plan to join us in Buffalo
for this event!

Say what? You don't read campiness into Mythologies? (Not to speak of the
erotics of the book on love.)

And double say-what on "essential aspect."

Subject:      What I saw at the Orono Conference 2000, Part I
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Charles, you asked people on the Poetics List to report on the recent
Orono Conference. I was there and I made a few notes. As usual, so
many impressions jumbling in that I can't think about them clearly,
like trying to pass out drunk but the room keeps spinning in my head.
But I'll do my best. Overall I had a marvelous time and can't think
of a single flaw in the arrangements or execution of this event,
though I can imagine others carping (in fact, I heard some of them).
Malcontents, though we always need malcontents don't we.

Dodie Bellamy and I got off a plane in Portland on Wednesday, June
28, 2000, and drove a few hours North to the campus in Orono, a
bucolic part of Maine so familiar from all those Stephen King novels
and right past Lawndale Cemetery-the original of "Pet Sematery" &
just as spooky in real life. Then we got to the registration building
to "check in," you should have seen our faces when we found out we
were sharing a room with Keith Tuma, Alan Golding and George
Bowering! Talk about frightening! But all turned out just fine
because they really meant a "suite," a form of dorm living they
didn't have when I was a college boy. All was civilized and up and
up. Before I knew more, it was time to repair to the greeting
ceremony in the "Ornamental Gardens" of Orono where all kinds of eats
were laid out on trays--hamburgers, chicken, cole slaw, potato salad,
garden burgers, and the reddest hot dogs I've ever seen, that I found
out were called "Maine red hot dogs" (a regional treat), though only
lemonade and iced tea to drink which quashed the cocktail party
atmosphere, or sedated it I guess, still the lovely pink roses of
Maine, that seem to breathe salt like fish, made this very festive,
etc., while we sat while various University dignitaries welcomed us.
I decided then and there to compile a Fashion Report on the best and
worst outfits people were wearing (so shall share with you some of my
knowledge) as well as decide which panels, plenary talks, readings,
etc., were good and which were ho-hum. To tell the truth, I was
panicking a little because, in this garden display, I recognized only
a few familiar faces and was thinking, my God, all these strangers,
and probably all of them on the Poetics List with only a limited
opinion of me. Shallow? Perhaps, but this was a crowd growing unruly
with no cocktails and a hard look to them, like a bunch of Jack Elams
thirsty for gin and blood in Once Upon a Time in the West. Then the
line parted and Amiri Baraka, whom I had never met, showed his face,
and the unruly mood of the crowd changed to something reverent and
sheepish. He is very little, like all stars when you see them in
person, little and with a big head, again, like the stars. For some
reason, watching him on TV and seeing all those photos I thought he'd
be a big Michael Clarke Duncan sort of fellow, but just the reverse.
Anyhow, this auspicious (if tiny) beginning in this elegant country
garden was only the prologue to the Conference's big drama events, as
you'll see.

The conference proper then moved to a long, low, tiered building
called "Corbett" in which I was to spend, in the week ahead, many of
my most sleepy hours ever. Don't know why, it was merely the oxygen,
filtered through charcoal, would put me in a stupor every twenty
minutes from which only the brilliance of what stabbed through me
from on-stage woke me up like smelling salts-sometimes. The first two
papers were delivered to all, Marjorie Perloff spoke with customary
verve and speed through an incredibly difficult series of
calculations, subtractions and speculations regarding the figures of
the "Watchman" and "Spy" in the eponymous Jasper Johns painting,
linking Johns' practice to that of O'Hara and Cage and causing kind
of a stir by hinting that, after all is said and done, O'Hara was
really a 50s kind of artist and has to make way, in retrospect, to
Johns and Cage (fundamental 60s artists) in history's long cool view.
The second plenary followed immediately afterwards, by Michael
Davidson, who gave a talk called "Missing Larry" (Eigner) that
evolved into a compassionate plea for a new "poetics of the disabled"
which might someday encompass a greater understanding of how disabled
people, like Eigner, who was born with cerebral palsy, work within
and without the field--a paper which I found very moving but
afterwards I was wondering how this poetics was really going to work
and how the poetry of disabled people is different (or is it supposed
to be?) from that of everyone else.  So, one wanted to see this paper
written down instead of trying to remember all of it with a memory as
faulty as mine.  But, together, this one two Perloff-Davidson punch
gave a taste of the range of topics touched on at the
conference--very rangy indeed, except a distinct lack of plenary
sessions about women writers of the 60s--I think that Lynn Keller's
paper on the early work of Rosmarie Waldrop, Kathleen Fraser, and
Fanny Howe was the honorary exception--and Albert Gelpi gave one on
the correspondence between Denise Levertov & Robert Duncan--not the
fault of any particular speaker, but maybe indicative of the
anti-feminism of the period?  Also, Waldrop, Fraser and Howe are not
my idea of sixties poets anyhow, but that leads me into another
conundrum of Orono, the slippage--

Slippage of 60s and 70s, so that we had readings from many poets who
didn't seem to be of the sixties at all, but perhaps put forth some
early poems in high school or university, testing the waters so to
speak, so it was all very odd and maybe a reason why the organizers
seem to be tiring of the "decade" custom they have followed over the
past several years?  That's mere speculation on my part.

Actually all through the first plenary session Dodie and I could
hardly tear our eyes away from Douglas Rothschild who showed up in a
guise new to us, he, the former pesky mosquito to NY Language
Poetry's tetchy donkey, and now magnificently arrayed and coiffed in
a retro seventies disco/leisure/high fashion series of suits and
boots, slimmed down, curled up, and looking very John Leguizamo and
relaxed.

Aldon Nielsen gave a short, impassioned introduction to his former
professor Amiri Baraka, and then the man himself took the stage,
hurling through his poems, humming little music snatches, brilliantly
blending monologic, lyric and "spoken word" styles with nary a pause,
shouting it out, dropping to a whisper like James Brown, the crowd
went nuts and once we saw Maria Damon clapping with her hands above
her head we joined in resulting in standing oration for Baraka, the
first of the conference.  Finally, we had encountered an actual 60s
poet, revolutionary fervor undimmed by time and dates and anything
else.

The events continued, though after so much thought I missed one
session and so failed to hear "Poet of the 60s" Gene Frumkin so I
still have no idea which one he was or is nor what he did either then
or now.  Instead we repaired for an open area of a building nearby
our dorm where a bar was set up and ordered drinks hastily and
ashamedly.  I remember still thinking, gee, none of these people look
familiar.  There was to be, as every night, an open reading with
conference attendees who could sign up as belatedly as five minutes
before, and we encountered our fellow Californian K. Silem Mohammad,
anxious perhaps about his reading to come, and wishing out loud that
he would be able to meet two particular poets, Jacques Debrot and
Michael Magee, whom he had never met except only through the portals
of the internet.  I looked behind me and there were Debrot and Magee,
wondering aloud the exact same thing, so was able to introduce them
to "Kasey" and end the suspense.  Apparently they all three got on
thick as thieves because for the next week you had only to look at
the one to find the other two.  The room started to crowd up and soon
there was a long line of people snaking through the space looking for
a drink.  There was Asa Watten, the 13 year old son of Barrett Watten
and Carla Harryman, plaintively wandering through the assemblage
looking for someone to play chess with.  He carried a whole chess set
in his knapsack.  This wasn't even remotely interesting to me, though
I've been a fan of Asa's for many, many years.  After an hour or so
the open reading began.  I can't remember everyone who read but I
heard some interesting readings from a variety of poets from all over
the world (very few Californians).  About 1.30 a.m., feeling tired, I
returned to my "suite," but I hadn't reckoned on my canny suite-mates
who had slipped out, bought their own liquor, and were having a party
of their own in our charming common room (just like Brideshead
Revisited!) -- I snapped a photo of the party then went to bed,
however after about 20 minutes located another room a few doors down,
with a big fireplace and a TV, and booted the rascals out into this
room so I could try to sleep, and that was only Wednesday.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

NEW AND ON VIEW: Mudlark No. 14 (2000)

Sarah Law | The Baptism of the Neophytes

Sarah Law lives in Norwich, England. She has been published in various
magazines including Big Allis No. 8 (focussing on British writers). Her
first full-length collection, Bliss Tangle, was published by Stride in
1999. Forthcoming publications include pieces in Poetry Lab and Pretext
Vol. 2, both anthologies produced by the University of East Anglia, and
future editions of Fire magazine. Sarah Law read English at Pembroke
College, Cambridge, and has a Ph.D. from Queen Mary and Westfield College,
London, on the influence of mysticism in modernist women writers. She is
currently researching the medieval mystics, working in a bookshop, and
teaching creative writing.

Author's Note: The Baptism of the Neophytes is a collection of poems based
on the Renaissance art of Venice and Florence. Since I bought a lot of
postcards during my visit there, the writing is inspired by postcard-sized
glimpses, and the density and uniform length of the poems reflect this.
The poems are intended to stand both as individual pieces exploring the
nature of spirituality, art, and love, and to form a single,
slowly-spiralling contemplation of these themes.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Subject:      R. Barthes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

brent,

as soon as i saw the first few lines of yr post i thot of the steve evans
essay, so i'm glad you had it in mind as well.  i've not read barthes for
at least five years, and when i did it was chiefly mythologies, s/z,
writing degree zero, with some dabbling in pleasure of the text and a
lover's discourse. so i'm not going to be very good on the specifics.

what interests me about the evans piece, and it ties in with the kit
robinson claim you restated to the effect that "the theoretical enthusiasm
of the Language poets circa the 1970s (excepting perhaps Watten's
formalistic obsessions) came more from Barthes than from any other
theorist or collection of theorists," is that evans makes a similar claim
and links it specifically to silliman's use of "the dwelling place," a
phrase taken from WDZ, for the title of his early mini-anthology of some
of the soon-to-be-known-as language poets in 1975.  evans writes that
"Silliman's references to Writing Degree Zero announce something like the
advent of Barthes's impact on American avant-garde poetry, an impact soon
to reverberate throughout the extended poetic community" (PPN, feb/march
2000, p.11).

now first off, and i think you were suggesting this, brent, different
theorists played different roles for different poets.  thus where
wittgenstein and cavell might be important for bernstein, you may in
turn have barthes important for silliman, derrida and lacan for
mccaffery, etc.

what i think is curious about the claims of robinson and evans (aside from
the need for actual demonstrations of the "reverberating impact" i.e. who
was reading what when and how was it informing their practice) is the
fact that the barthes of WDZ is, as i suggested at a recent talk i gave
in buffalo, the early Barthes, the Marxist and, I would argue, even
phenomenological Barthes (there are suggestions of Blanchot throughout
this work, and the notion of "la demeure" has decidedly Heideggerian
resonances), not the post-structuralist Barthes who would be popularized
for the "Death of the Author" and the pleasure of the text.

and here i would take exception to bill austin's periodization of barthes'
oeuvre as being marked by a structuralist/poststructuralist binary. S/Z
is the perfect undoing of that binary: what could be more structuralist
than to break down every phrase of a short story and assign it a place in
one of five "codes"?  then, as you read, you find yourself, or i found
myself at least, questioning barthes' taxonomy: hey, i thought he was
gonna make this phrase part of the hermeneutic code and instead he's made
it proairetic! thus, what could be more poststructuralist than to
find out that structures are arbitrary!

plus, this "dwelling place" is, for barthes, something arising out of
"modern" french literature, which for him stems back to the 19th century
and culminates in the nouveau roman.  this is a rather different
trajectory from the one staked out by the language-centered project, with
its appeals to alternative anglo modernisms (stein, zukofsky), russian
futurism and formalism, surrealism, new american poetry, etc.

thus what's surprising about silliman's invocation of barthes' "dwelling
place" in 1975, for me, in terms of theory, is that while WDZ is barthes
in his marxist phase, a marxist or even post-structuralist lexicon or
armature is more or less absent from silliman's commentary on the work of
the nine poets he gathered there (andrews, barbara baracks, coolidge, lee
dejasu, dipalma, grenier, melnick, silliman, watten).  in fact, it's more
of a purely formalist one, following i think grenier's question from
/this/ 1 about where are words most themselves. (answer, language itself,
language made strange, language whose non- or perhaps sur-referential
aspects have been foregrounded.)

so my sense is that the "explicit" presence of "(french) theory" is
something added to the language-centered project as it evolves.
silliman's appeal to barthes in 1973/5 contains no dead authors,
de-centered subjects, free-play of signifiers or ideological and state
apparatuses; these theoretical components, along with the crucial link
between referentiality and the commodity fetish, comes initially with
bruce andrews (i don't have paradise and method at hand to give
you dates for essays, but it makes sense the a polisci prof would have
access to althusser, gramsci, frankfurt school, etc., at this time) and
mccaffery (in the "politics of the referent" section of /open letter/
he edited in 1976-77 and featuring andrews, bernstein, himself, and
silliman).

so there's a rather small window of time we're dealing with here, and of
course the history of this theory-langpo relation is yet to be
written (as silliman suggests in a footnote to his essay in the last
poetics journal).  further, there's the actual relation versus the
perceived relation by poet-detractor, academics, etc.  i mean, hillis
miller was dropping deleuze and derrida into his footnotes in the early
1970s like it was common knowledge.  also, some of the folks working on
ethnopoetics and publishing in alcheringa in the early 1970s were already
quite familiar with levi-strauss and derrida.

so it's all quite complicated. and fascinating.

bests,
t.

Subject:      Moderation & Immoderate Poetics
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

A few days ago I received Dodie Bellamy's post quoting a post of Richard
Dillon's, which Dodie termed hate speech.  I didn't save that post, not
intending to reply to it, so I can't quote it or even refer to its subject
line.  Dodie ended up asking why we have a moderated list, with the delays
inherent in that, if we are going to allow this sort of thing to get
through.  I have had conversations & backchannels with other list members
about this exact point-- as well as the fact that the discussion, as in
Dillon's post, often doesn't seem to be about poetics anymore.

In the time since Dodie's post, the list has been silent.  Maybe this has
been due to the U.S. holiday (though I for one would have thought that
reports & gossip about Orono would have filled the bandwidth, especially
given the exchange that I hear happened between Amiri Baraka & Barrett
Watten).  But that's beside the point....

I feel a little uncomfortable siding with Dodie on this, not because I don't
think it IS hate speech, but because I'm uncomfortable coming down on the
side of censorship under any circumstances, whatever the "good" cause.  On
the other hand, I personally have seen behavior on this list that was at
best offensive, and at worst detrimental to a free and open exchange of
ideas.  I know I've censored myself on occasion because I didn't want to
make myself the target of a cheap shot, or I didn't have the energy for a
debate that might turn ugly.  Is this "free speech"?  Ultimately a moderated
list equals an EDITED exchange-- because being on this list *isn't* a right,
& because anybody is free to get their opinions out by other means on the
internet (or anywhere else).

Most of the people I personally know on this list are lurkers.  Why is that?
  (Well, I think I know why).  All of this is what a moderated list was
supposed to do something about.  My intent is not to put Chris Alexander on
the hot seat here.  But it's impossible to raise the issue of the quality of
exchange on the list, and particularly its least productive extreme, without
also raising the issue of the criteria for list moderation.  Chris, to his
credit, has seemed to want to moderate by consensus-- & I think it's fair to
say that the consensus has seemed to be when in doubt, let it through.
Certainly-- & this goes to my point-- there are those who will raise the cry
of censorship, loudly, if they feel list moderation has been too heavy
handed.  This was the situation that Charles Bernstein was put in, & I can't
blame Chris Alexander for not wanting to follow in his footsteps.  But on
the other hand, it does seem that enough is enough.

Ultimately, I think most people (including myself) are on the list to get
news, to advertise their own publications or events, maybe to hear some
gossip, and then lastly (if at all) to entertain a discussion of poetics
with total strangers whose work, in some cases, one doesn't know.  This at
best makes the conversation awkward.  Add to that the fact that list
subscribers seem to represent a fairly diverse range of poetic viewpoints, &
I think you can see where we get into trouble.

The utopian possibilities for the list are, of course, the hopes that such
awkwardnesses will be transcended & a real conversation, thus, take place.

If poetry can never be moderate, our behavior in public spaces (including
this one) should be.

I (for one) haven't lost hope (yet).

Subject:      What I saw at the Orono Conference 2000, part II
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

What I saw at the Orono Conference on Thursday, June 29, 2000

I woke up startlingly early.  Breakfast, 7:00 a.m., seemed so early
but then I figured, oh, if I was in my regular life I certainly would
be up by 6.30, so managed to fool myself for quite a while.  I crept
out of my room to have a cigarette and was confronted in the hallway
by an amazing number of beer bottles, empty half-pints, soda cartons
and crushed plastic cups brimming with old Kool butts. The Capricorn
in me rebelled and I pulled a big trash liner to one side and began
cleaning up, my thoughts roiling, nervous for some reason. In
ordinary life I work for a large janitorial company and in my head I
could imagine the scorn and contempt with which the Orono janitors
would be thinking about the poets and scholars they were cleaning up
after. This was so Felix Unger of me I could hardly believe it
myself, but all of a sudden a finger's tapping my shoulder and a
courtly voice speaks through the gray dawn, "May I be of some
assistance, young man?" Curtly I grunted, turned around and came face
to face with John Wieners, whom I hadn't seen in ten years or so. "I
slept like a top!" he cried out, "Then I came to my senses and wanted
a smoke." He looked great. Okay, not great, but if you'd been through
what he's been through you'd probably look worse.

We sifted through the glass debris like a pair of rag pickers from a
painting by Jean-Francois Millet. Chancing upon a disgusting bottle
of Labatt Blue, Wieners paused. "This beer is Canadian-Fred Wah must
be here," he deduced, growing agitated like Sherlock Holmes at the
Reichenbach Falls. "I must see Fred Wah and his two children and
Pauline!" He speaks a bit more slowly, haltingly, than most
Bostonians I've known, but with exacerbated finality and
righteousness. But also a kind of sweet demureness I've never known
elsewhere.

"I have a present for you," I said, hauling it out of my pocket. Have
any of you seen the new book "The Blind See Only the Blind" (Pressed
Wafer/Granary Books) in which 30 or 40 poets pay tribute to John
Wieners? The volume climaxes with a new poem by Wieners himself, in
which he waxes lyrical about forgotten stars of his youth, including
the one and only Edie Adams, a blond comedienne/soubrette who long
ago starred in the Broadway musicals "Wonderful Town" (1953) and
"Li'l Abner" (1957). The day the "Blind" book came in the mail, Dodie
and I had a chance to meet Edie Adams and we took the book to her
gingerly enough and asked her to sign it "to our friend the great
poet." She claimed to have known, in her Hollywood heyday, both Allen
Ginsberg and Carl Sandberg ("all the burgs," she boasted) so poetry
was no big thing for her. "Was John Wieners ever in San Francisco?"
she cried, a tiny wrinkle crossing her forehead. "Then I met him in
1959 with Ernie!" (Ernie Kovacs, her late husband.) As this was just
possible, I nodded bumptiously, showed her where to sign. I produced
the book now for Wieners. "Look what she wrote, "FOR JOHN WIENERS,
HOW EXCITING FOR ME, I LOVE YOUR WORK, LOVE, EDIE ADAMS, SAN
FRANCISCO 2000."

John held the book from different angles, peering at it above and
below his face-a-main, as though it would bite him. "I thought she
must be deceased!" "No, and Dodie took pictures of her signing it."
"Please let me examine the shots," he begged. I showed him two which
I'd tucked into the book-one shot of Adams grinning into the camera,
her white powdered face bigger than the Cheshire Cat's. The other
showed her querulous profile as she sat lost in thought, trying to
remember the good old Hotel Wentley days I assume. "I'd like one of
these, Kevin, for my own," John said. "But only one. And I can't
decide which shows the sheer insouciance of Miss Adams to best
advantage. May I decide later?"

"We are all so excited you are here among us," I said. It's hard to
talk to someone with Wieners' personality without lapsing into his
particularly affected lingo-at least it's hard for a Capricorn. "Take
all the time you need!" So saying I slung my garbage bag over my
shoulder like Ralph Kramden and went to breakfast and a day of panels.

The regular panel sessions: always or so it seemed, so many good ones
all at the same time so that one was forced to make these agonizing
decisions and usually they each turned out wrong.  For example, the
first choice was among a panel called "Echoes of the 1930s," then one
on John Ashbery, a separate panel on NY School poets, a Baraka And
Others panel, and one called "A sense of place."  I don't know, I
just figured, A sense of place sounds dull, though maybe I'm wrong.
So that was out.  "Echoes of the 1930s?"  That was a good possibility
because the abstracts of the papers sounded so intriguing and
sometimes one feels, oh why go to a panel on someone like Ashbery,
why not go and find out something about someone more obscure, how
else will I ever learn anything?  So this "Echoes" panel had papers
on Ramon Guthrie, Carl Rakosi, and Thomas McGrath, poets who were
still active in the 1960s tho productive as early as the 1930s, and I
know a little bit about Rakosi  and McGrath but nothing about Ramon
Guthrie & I still don't.  I wound up taking the better part of valor,
by attending a panel I knew would have at least one good paper,
because I had heard Lytle Shaw give a paper before and knew he'd
deliver value for money, so to speak.  This panel, chaired by the
dapper, French-cut, exhausted Steven Evans, was on "In and Around New
York," and Lytle's paper outlined the possible connections in life
and in poetry between Frank O'Hara and Ezra Pound, a subject on which
I had never thought it possible to write even a sentence let alone 20
minutes worth of paper.  Turns out that O'Hara had written a poem on
"The Pisan Cantos" and later, in a different frame of mind, a mind
turned 100% towards Personalism, made Pound one of his subjects in
"Biotherm"!  From these two angles Lytle developed a theory that
clarified the different attitudes towards audience that O'Hara and
Pound each worked from.  Funny that Pound wound up outliving O'Hara,
who must have thought Pound such an old man when he began to write.
At Orono these kinds of thoughts came to one often.  I looked at the
classroom we were sitting in, and remembered back to 4 years ago.
This was the very classroom in which the top of my head came off
after a particularly brilliant brace of O'Hara papers given by Steve
(Evans) himself and by Ben Friedlander during the 50s conference.
And now, as though it had been some sort of audition, both Evans and
Friedlander have been hired by U Maine Orono!  This must, I decided,
spell good luck for Lytle Shaw!

After the first panel, all spilled out into the lobby of "Corbett"
Hall and drank coffee and talked about which panels and papers had
been the best.  All papers, or so it seemed, given by anyone named
"Jonathan" had been noteworthy.  (I didn't hear any Jonathans, alas,
during my entire stay.)  Dee Morris introduced me to Richard Quinn
who, or so everyone said, had just given a great paper on Albert
Ayler, John Coltrane and Amiri Baraka on the "Baraka and Others"
panel.  I wondered how the "Sense of Place" people had done, and then
the program book told me there were two upcoming readings at 10 and
at 11 by Ted Enslin, Nathaniel Tarn and Toby Olson, people one would
never ordinarily get to hear in San Francisco, and this made me
reflect that "Sense of Place" studies were never stronger than in
Maine.

In the afternoon, after lunch, I didn't have as much choice about
what to see, because I had committed to chairing a panel, and so had
Dodie.  We both missed the "Baraka and Others II" panel, the panel on
Brooks, Rukeyser and Rexroth, and the panel on Dickey, Eckman and
Snyder.  Again a few Jonathans took the field.  The first Louis
Zukofsky panel was in this slot too, and apparently this was one of
the very best of the week.  Dodie told me hers went very well, with
Linda Russo taking off on Barrett Watten's Hettie Jones take, and
Matthew Pifer giving a research-based paper on Detroit's twin streams
of counterculture and revolutionary mimeo work in the 1960s (like
John Sinclair).  Alas, our dear Nick Lawrence did not appear due to
illness, a virulent South African fever felling him, ironic since his
paper was to have been called "Mimeo Fever."  (He eventually did
arrive at the conference, a bit frail, and some were heard to make
ebola jokes.)  The panel I chaired was great, even if I say so
myself, for I had leapt at a chance to be the chair for a panel
featuring 3 of my favorite poets, Tony Lopez, Marjorie Welish, and
Kasey Mohammad on "The New York School."  Welish speaks so precisely
and learnedly and wittily in every sentence--some unexpected verb or
adjective pins down her thought like Nabokov his butterflies.  Kasey
whom I now regard as one of our California homeboys did us proud by
giving a very very close reading to a particular Ashbery poem I can't
remember which one now (but it's the one that ends a stanza with the
word "The"), and Tony Lopez brilliantly read Ted Berrigan's sequence
"In the Early Morning Rain" as a way of explaining how the Sonnets
were constructed, managing to inject some controversy by soundly
rebutting some other recent article about Berrigan by Libbie Rifkin,
an admirable scholar indeed.  Afterwards Tony said ruefully, "Maybe I
shouldn't have come down so hard on Rifkin, for they do say she's
gorgeous."

I was startled then to see Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop walking through
the hallway, for their lack of interest at conferences has long been
a truism of poetry, like the reclusivity of Jess or the hair of Jorie
Graham.  But there they were, she, with the piquant looks of a
younger Luise Rainer, and the voice of Glinda the Good Witch, and he,
with that freaky Charles Manson hair and beard that might scare a
child, except he has the open, sweet, appealing face of one of the
Teletubbies.  "Why are you here?" I called to them in disbelief.
Turned out they had shown up out of personal loyalty to Steve Evans
and to Jennifer Moxley.

The plenary sessions that evening were just as intriguing.  One was
by Frank Davey on "Regressive Poetics of the 1960s."  Briefly he
described the ways in which Canadian poetry was turned on its head in
the 1960s in ways which had not entirely positive effects for its
state today.  Davey was part of a large Canadian contingent we were
very happy to greet, as the conference this year had changed its
emphasis slightly to include the formerly rebuffed or excluded
Canadians, I wonder why?  Anyway Frank Davey wins our Fashion Award
hands down with his beautiful Haspel suit, in a lightweight cotton so
highly pressed it seemed metallic, bought (or so we later learned) on
the eve of a trip to India in April 1982.  Barrett Watten followed
Davey with a slide and video presentation about the Berkeley Free
Speech riots of the mid-60s and their aftermath.  This was a talk
with a lot of carefully wrought argument that was wonderful to look
at and listen to, but in the end it all wound up being
extraordinarily personal, as though the breakdown of the revolution
had resulted in one salutary effect, Watten's own graduation from UC
Berkeley in 1968 and the birth of the Language Poetry movement
(foretold when, asked for his opinions about some Berkeley protest
march at which he was present, Allen Ginsberg thought for a minute
and then began emitting a Sanskrit mantra, resulting in a perplexity
and turning inside out of language that Watten, et al, were to take
to even greater heights).  This is the event that Matt Richardson has
reported on to us on the List, in which "Baraka attended this reading
and finally lashed out at Watten for being a "hyper-rational
pseudo-radical" and for "pimping"radical politics for his own
academic benefit."  Coming in late, but carrying a whole sheaf of
notes, Baraka called out from the audience to Davey and Watten, "I
don't know your names, so I'll call you First Person and Second
Person."  He accused them of character assassination and of trashing
the 60s so that their academic careers would prosper.  The debate
grew so heated that a conference organizer (Ben Friedlander) took the
unprecedented step of scheduling an ad hoc panel in the middle of the
cafeteria on another day to stage a formal debate between Watten and
Baraka.  But more of this later.

The adrenalin high, the bar opened its doors, and happily there were
Liz Willis and Kristin Prevallet who, shopping at the local IGA in
Orono, came upon a display of Tab, the 1960s Coca-Cola-made soft
drink to which I became addicted quite early, and which was withdrawn
from sale in California about 3 years ago.  And Liz and Kristin
brought me a case of it, the best gift I ever had, and so I spent the
remaining days of the conference quite drunk on Tab which, I
understand, took its name from a NASA prototype and stands
acronymically for "Totally Artificial Beverage" the way "TANG" used
to mean "Totally Artificial Nutrient Group," thus completing the 60s
motif (for me) through a regressive synaesthesia.  And then the open
reading started up and I read and Dodie read and we felt
well-attended and safe, far from home, and that was Thursday, pretty
much.

More later.

I'm enjoying this.  All of the posts are, well, smart and stylish.  I'll
rethink my position.  But I don't think that the
structuralist/poststructuralist division rests comfortably on the idea of the
sign/structure as arbitrary.  T'ain't the difference.  Early structuralists
such as Levi-Strauss and the precursor Saussure fiddled with that idea (and,
of course, many others).  The issue is if and when Barthes realized that he,
like other structuralists, was operating in bad faith, smuggling into his
writing that user friendly logos when he thought he was ridding us of it.
Derrida's contribution to structuralism was to say, simply, "See what you
did?!!?"  He exposed, as we all know, Foucault's ostensible "deconstruction"
of Descartes as mere reassembling and reinstatement.  Foucault freaked, and
attacked Derrida rather viciously.  Barthes, on the other hand,  saw what he
did.  Cheers

Howdy folks,   been enjoying the Orono memoirs that have been coming in.
I'll let others describe the Baraka/Watten lava fire in detail but I
wanted to say that, in addition to Ben F. and Maria's hugely important
efforts to put together the  B/W (wow that just occurred to me...) Summit,
there were some other events that helped to bring the complexities of that
initial exchange into light -- chief among them for me was plenary talk
that Lorenzo Thomas gave (Bob Perelman began by giving a talk on Melvin
Tolson which was itself a bridge-building attempt: Tolson is important,
for instance, to Harryette Mullen, and Mullen knows better than anyone
else, it seems to me, how to negotiate the border between reified versions
of "African American Literature" and "Language Writing"; likewise someone
like Nate Mackey who noted 10 years ago that works like Tolson's "tend to
become margins within margins, receiving much less attention and
validation than they deserve"): Thomas gave a sort of retrospective on the
Black Arts movement designed in part to (quoting badly from memory here)
problematize the idea that the Black Arts movement is merely "a chapter in
Amiri Baraka's autobiography."  What followed was an incredibly deft
retelling which gave sharp focus to the social forces at work in and
around the movement, itÕs creative energy, itÕs *range*, and, to steal a
phrase from K Burke, "the motvies of its rhetoric" Ð Baraka, along with
Askia Turre (who was also in the audience) and Larry Neal, came off as
tireless, and deeply committed, strategically flexible, damn important
writers.  At the same time, there was an interesting, though friendly,
cutting session going on with Baraka (with Watten fight already part of
the Orono lore); one example (again from memory): Thomas mentioned that
the Black Arts Movement was constantly in danger of being taken over by
thugs: "Baraka, in his Autobiography, mentions that he thought those guys
*might* be fakin their commitment to the movement...Everyone else was sure
of it."  I read this as a call for Baraka to fess up on this point: that
his "might be" was a hedge.  And again, the really incredible aspect of
LorenzoÕs discussion  was that moments like these didnÕt diminish BarakaÕs
stature, relevance, or even position, precisely because Lorenzo had, from
the beginning, described the Black Arts movement as an *improvisational
collective* -- in that sense all he was doing was restoring some sense of
the movements original operations: after all, the Baraka-centric telling
(a mass media / academic mythology?) negelcts the fact that it was
*Baraka* who came to the movement, not the other way around: as Askia
Turre put it multiple times during this week, he and Larry Neal were
already doing their thing in Harlem when Baraka showed up and the initial
interaction, at least, involved *him* adjusting to *them* (and many
others).  This point was put into sharp focus for me at one of the Baraka
panels on Thursday.  Alicia Thompson had given a paper on Baraka, Black
Arts and Coltrane; during the Q & A session she went to address a point
which had just been made by a gentleman in the audience: "IÕm sorry I
donÕt know your name," she said, or something to that effect.  Someone in
the audience said, "That's Askia Turre" Ð at which point Alicia literally
screamed at the top of her lungs, like a Beatles fan ca. 1965.  She had
never met him and she was completely floored.  Obviously for her the Black
Arts movement didnÕt come down to Baraka, though as her paper indicated he
was/is as important *as the others*.

These moments were crucial to me after the dividing lines of the first
night, though even then the lines blurred pretty quickly.  Standing by the
bar later that night I was talking with Lorenzo Thomas when who comes
along but Baraka.  Now IÕm standing with Lorenzo Thomas and Amiri Baraka,
drunk off my ass and trying to concentrate so I donÕt forget anything they
say!  ItÕs clear immediately that what pissed off Baraka about PerloffÕs
talk is his perception that that she had marched out the tired old "OÕHara
was a tragic, depressive figure, like that highschool kid whose a lot of
fun when heÕs drunk but is always drawing skulls in his notebook during
geometry class" argument.  (IÕm with Baraka on this one, as anyone who saw
my paper on Saturday could tell, and itÕs worth mentioning that any "New
American Poet" IÕve ever talked to, from Berkson to Shapiro to Koch, has
said that the Gooch/Perloff "death-drive" Frank OÕHara theory is a bunch
of hooey.)  At which point the following exchange takes place:

Baraka: What was she saying?

Me: (sheepishly trying Ð really Ð not to demonize Marjorie) I guess she
was sort of doing the "tragic Frank OÕHara."

Baraka: Frank wasnÕt tragic.  He just got hit by a fuckin car. [Lorenzo &
I start to laugh, I pratically blow Jack Daniels through my nose] He was
the funniest motherfucker I ever knew.

(A Note: On Friday night I had the unfortunate experience of overhearing
Perloff trying to convince Bob Perlman that Melvin Tolson was "a minor
poet" Ð what does it mean for Perloff to be talking like the reincarnation
of John Crowe Ransom?)

On either Thursday or Friday night, I canÕt remember which, I stumbled
into an argument being had by Baraka and Douglas Rothchild: Douglas had
said that Shakespeare sucked (thinking, as some speculated, that this was
something Baraka might like to hear?): Baraka asked him what the fuck he
was talking about and whether he maybe had a screw loose, etc, then
brought someone over I think (Thomas?) saying, hey comeÕere, this guy
thinks Shakespeare is a bad writer! Needling him for about 10 minutes.
Andrew Epstein should tell this whole story as he was there from the
beginning and possibly less drunk than me.

Andrew, incidentally, was one of the "thick thieves" Kevin Killian
mentioned, along with myself, Jacques and Kasey Mohammad.  Look for our
manifesto in next monthÕs ReaderÕs Digest.

The open readings were one of the big highlights for me Ð Kasey & Jacques
knocked people out; Lee Ann: polymorphous Appalachian NY School jive which
I can never get enough of; Kristen Prevallet gave a great reading which
made me go, damn, I gotta read me some more Kristen Prevallet; Carla
Harryman gave a reading which I think has already been mentioned but
which, anyway, made me want to sing "for sheÕs a jolly good fellow" and
made several of us say, Carla Harryman is the best Language Poet (a "major
poet" Ð hah!)  Mark McMorris read the wonderful "A Poem for the Love of
Women" which IÕm lucky enough to be publishing in COMBO 7.  He also
engaged Bob Perelman late into the early morning at the final David
Bromige Party Ð and this seemed to me to be an important consequence of
the Baraka/Watten.  To Bob's credit, (and to Bromige's and Alan Golding's
and Keith Tuma's) the younger writers who were there that night were
treated, I think, to an even playing field, a lot of good gossip, and some
genuine negotiation that should have some effect, I hope, on the work of
those present plus their friends and neighbors.  I missed my good friend
Kristen Gallagher, who shoulda been there.

mr dillon,

we read your posts b/c we are curious about what you are thinking. it's not
that they're a good read, but that it's incredible that you could be so
hateful and arrogant and blinded, and we are shocked and horrified.

we read your posts because your posts are kind of like a car crash on the
side of the road, and many of us fall into the category of passers-by who
can't help but look. or something like that.

we read your posts b/c some of us get the list in digest, and have to wade
through several versions of your post as people respond to your bilious words.

we read your posts because we think you might be suffering from megalomania,
due to your continued insistence on posting to a list that repeatedly says it
doesn't want you. we wonder what you think you're doing: saving us? informing
us? so we read, looking for signs.

we read your posts because we are waiting for you to say you've had it with
us, that we're fools, and you're going away.

we read, waiting for you to announce you've started your own list somewhere,
that you'll continue your conversation elsewhere, and that whomever wishes to
join you should back-channel their email address to you.

waiting.
reading and waiting.

That this simpleton has the hubris to put his puerile rantings in the same
category as Swift is laughable!  What a maroon. Personally, I'd like to see
him r*moved from Poetics because of the simplistic, thoroughly cliched
rhetoric, not because of the (supposedly controversial) political
orientation -- which if done by someone with half a brain, or something
original to say, might actually inspire a response.

As it is, I'm just being required to waste my already-limited net reading
time avoiding his misogynistic conspiracy-theory rants in the
already-difficult-to-navigate (because consecutive posts run together, and
because when universities are in session they are so long) digests.

I suspect a lot of lurkers may be considering just throwing in the towel on
Poetics because of this crap, as I am, frankly -- which may be the intent
of a trolling [1] poster in the first place -- simply to destroy the
existing discourse: just for giggles, or because it disagrees with his own
agenda.

(For those unfamiliar, "trolling" is a term on the net for posting with the
sole intent of reeling in hostile reactions. The practice is right up there
with "spamming" as a menace to reasonable conversation on Usenet and email
lists. This Dillon character is a classic troller, in my fairly lengthy
experience in net-based discussion groups. Anyone who thinks he'll engage
in intelligent discussion, or go away on his own, is kidding her- or himself.)

Having been on the list between 4 and 5 years, i have a request (and
an observation)... In the last 8 months or so, messages like this one
have proliferated:  the poster is not incredibly well known to
everyone on the list (oftern hasn't been active on it for very long)
;  and they do not sign their post in any way.  (tho they often say
very aggressive, self-dramatizing sorts of things)....

i am left to conclude that this person is,
"Derbadumdoo@AOL.COM"...Which probably doesn't leave most of us any
the wiser...it's no help to me, for sure.

One of the problems is that e-mail address are coming to less often
incorporate significant parts of a person's name;  another, is the
gradual seeping onto the list of the very slap-dash conventions which
have long been developing on the net in general.....

But for most of the list's existence, there has been a tendency for
people to know who they're addressing, and to make it clear who's

In a recent post, Ron Henry used the phrase "What a maroon."

I'd like to know the etymology of this saying. I know Bugs Bunny made it
widely popular, but whence does it come?

Is it a deliberate mispronunciation of "moron"?

Is it a private thing of Tex Avery's?

Anyone?

his Pound. Nor that Tolson's Modernism didn't include Eliot, or even (by
1965) any 50's O'Hara or Zukofsky or Olson {had they been made POST-Modern
yet?} certainly bob quoted Tolson talking about Eliot a lot......(so?)
(bob's dilemna--if i have it right--was that in pound the correspondence
between encription & deciferment is direct & one to one. but Tolson become
unclear when you try to see it this way.) so bob got hung up on this
"impenitrability" of Tolson's text. [I suggested that one read Tolson as if
some of it was Pound & some of it was O'Hara--bob rejected this. He also
rejected my reading of a Whitmanian moment when Tolson seems to wag his
finger at the "critic" reading the text. {perhaps bob didn't want to get
wagged at?}] I didn't get the bridging though, bob never mentioned how
Tolson's work was important to anyone's writing (i.e. Mullen, Mackey,

But let me point out here that Lorenzo's talk was about JAY WRIGHT & his
relation to Black Arts. & also, yes the BAM was bigger than Baraka, but it
was many more people than got talked about at the conference.....i was the
only person to say the name Don E. Lee. I heard mention of Sonia Sanchez,
but did anyone say Nikki Giovani? (i missed the panel with BAM & Coltrane,
so they probably did get mentioned)....etc.

[]  actually, only myself & askia & baraka were there from the beginning. &
i might add, baraka & askia were saying things that they take AS FACT that
would light the hair of rigid white academics on fire.....similar flames to
white reactions in the 50's & 60's to claims that the egyptians were
black....but that is another story...baraka was making the point that
shakespair was a revolutionary, & shakespair was writing to show people that
the rulers were totally whack & the people should topple them. he was also
making the point i didn't know what i was talking about, but as i was going
I pointed out to baraka that i had read 15 plays & acted in 3 of them, to
which i thought he acknowledged that i might have at least had an IDEA of
what was going on.

[]  a final point. TWICE baraka tried to discredit me with this "he thinks
shake... is shit" move. this was the first time, the second time was during
the slug fest when i asked a question framed by the observation that they
didn't need the riot police & tear gas in this room to prevent the
studen/intellectual uprising, because the two self-stiled revolutionary
leaders, instead of finding common ground from which to find a basis for
action, were fighting each other. so i suggested they change direction & try
to find a commonality, instead of pointing out that they disagreed, as we
already knew that. Baraka's response was to "out" me as i assume "wack" to
his 90% white academic audience, as a shakespear hater. i think he
miscalculated though, about half of the people in the room already knew this
about me. but i was glad to be able to out radical Amiri, & force him to
"call out the National Guard" so to speak to silence/discredit me.

[]  & HEY, i read between Leanne & Carla.....& Jaques Dibro read a great
Ashberry poem. but even if you didn't like it, you could have mentioned that
i let everyone heckle me.

As far as I can tell my name (Joseph Massey) is tucked beside my e-mail
address
in the message. So what difference does it make that the e-mail address
doesn't hint at who I am? And who cares who I am? I signed onto this list
expecting some back&forth about poetry / poetics, and announcements of
readings and publications.

I didn't realize it was such a CLIQUE, with so much petty bullshit scattered
around. Who cares about this Dillon's messages? Everyone opposed to what he
has to say, and makes that opposition known on the list, has done so very
passionately. They state he's doing it for attention and all the while
they're soaking him in it.

Personally, I'd rather read Dillon's messages than another bad poem by Alan
Sondheim --- but I'm not about gagging people.

Leave the Dillon posts alone, and he'll probably stop posting.

        Thank you Mark for a very considered and considerate response.

        Free Speech is a powerful term & principle, because it comes at
such a great cost.

        In all senses of that word, cost--

        In New Hampshire, they have the slogan:  "The price of freedom is
        eternal vigilance"
        and the license plates read
        "Live Free or Die"

        The tactics emnployed by Vigilante Dillon are, as many are aware
from other lists, very simple: to bait those whom they see as rather sheep
like self righteous persons going about their business with an assurance
which masks, to the vigilante, an easily stirred anxiety.

        The vigilante's plan is to disrupt the flock and turn the would be
peaceful into what he assumes them to be:  wolves in sheep's clothing, all
too ready to bare their bestial nature and foam at the mouth and howl for
blood--to which the vigilante counters with what he presents as a
"reasoned
discourse" based on a carefully selected list of inflammatory texts and
debatable "historical facts", not to mention "imagery:  jutting chins,
upward lifted eyes and the like.

        It's a rather clumisly constructed anti-discourse aimed at
putting a bee in the bonnet of those the vigilante sees as soley concerned
with a discourse of rhetoric, which can be easily flustered by a counter
rhetoric.

        The baiting is to bring about censorship, and prove that the
self-proclaimed
openminded are indeed the "fascists" the vigilante claims them to be.

        Well, some of the old recalcitrants & recidivists, who just plum
can't seem to get
reformed, put their heads together and came up with a few suggestions.

        One is--silence: let ol' vigilante man send his posts and no one
respond--just press the delete button and set the fella loose unto "the
silence of these immense  spaces" as Pascal put it.

        Another is to go the other direction from silence: noise, noise
and
more noise.

        Each time vigilante man sends a post, send it back to him, maybe
altering the header to something cute & Hallmarky:  "A tasty tidbit for
you" "words to the wise, guy", "helpful hints for the holidays", "a
remembrance on your retirment", "greetings from the Great Outdoors" and
the like.

        One can even extend this,if feeling truly ornery, by  forwarding
the posts to others,so they,
too can return the messages--and
the vigilante man finds his mail basket bursting at the seams with his own
returned words, the inbox groaning and the disc quota warnings going off
like firecrackers on the Fourth of July.


        In the echo of only his own words coming bak to him, the vigilante
man will realize that no one else out there is listening--or responding
back.

        "Chatty fella--choked to death on his own words"

        Terminal silence--or terminal overload.

        "The silence of these immense spaces frightens me"

Michael Magee reports my talk (via Baraka) as putting down Frank
O'Hara!  I guess you weren't listening.  I would never put down Frank
and I don't buy the "death drive" theory as my book makes clear.  I was
making a case for Frank being different from Jasper Johns and what some
of the 50s/ 60s dynamics were.  Why is that a putdown?
But, yes, I plead guilty on the Tolson case; does this make me an
admirer of John Crowe Ransom's; I don't think so.  Why these binary
oppositions?

It all depends on whose ox is being gored.

Nothing I have said is as hurtful as what happened to or said about Paula
Jones.

At least I answer.  You contemplate the election to the Senate someone who
doesn't debate, who sends factotums before you.

Ron Henry is offended that I defend myself.  That's interesting.  All I did
was to see what it would be like to rattle a cage.

One has to be politically correct to carry a J. Swift card, it seems.  My
friends in the Special Forces risked their lives for the First Amendment so
that Henry could demonstrate how I was wrong.

Don't worry, Friend.  Even I don't have the interest to keep on rattling
this cage forever.

Thank you, Mark DuCharme, for speaking for the First Amendment.  According
to the rules of this list, what we have just been through is one of the
list's purposes: an argument about politics.  I have tried to employ within
the limits of my ability certain poetic techniques I saw used at Naropa by
Allen Ginsberg, but I came at the problem from my concept of the Right Wing.

My investigative poetry is born of immersion within both communities in the
country, Left and Right.  I stood close for many years as Allen Ginsberg
danced his "Howl."  I have listened to the truth of former Clinton
speechwriter and business associate Larry Nichols, the Clintons chief
antagonist from Arkansas, who, six months ago had his ribs broken by unknown
assailants wielding baseball bats because, as they said, he kept writing and
speaking after they had told him to stop.

All the best,

Richard Dillon

Hi again everyone, Andrew Epstein just backcaneled me about my post
Baraka, Perloff and the Orono Players.  If you thought my take on
MarjorieÕs talk wrong, ridiculous, slanted, or just think IÕm kookoo for
CocoPuffs, PLEASE READ WHATÕS BELOW: itÕs AndrewÕs correction along with
my response.    Ð m.

Andrew Epstein sayeth:
[Also, I just wanted to point out something about what you call the
"Gooch/Perloff 'death-drive' O'Hara theory":  I'd be careful about
ascribing that position to Marjorie.  If you look again, she spends a lot
of time in her book on FOH dispelling that theory (much of the first
chapter!):  she discusses "how careful we must be not to mythologize the
death of the poet. No one can know, of course, what was going on inside
O'Hara's mind during the night of July 24, but it seems safe to say that
if he had wanted to commit suicide,if he had 'courted death' as the myth
has it, there would have been a much surer way of doing it.  Being hit by
a beach buggy is hardly a guarantee of instant -- or certain -- death, and
indeed, as we have seen, O'Hara did not die immediately and remained
conscious until the end... I think, accordingly, that it is time to forget
all about Fire Island and the so-called 'killing' -- or instinctive
suicide -- of Frank O'Hara.  For what really matters is not the myth of
the poete maudit but his work." (5). Later in the book, she comes back to
this issue and again strongly argues against the notion of a sad,
depressed O'Hara in the mid-1960s.  Overall, isn't she just saying "he
just got hit by a fucking car"?

And in her presentation, all I recall that she said about the "depressed"
side of O'Hara is her reading of a very depressing poem dedicated to
Johns, "Clouds go soft," which she analyzes in her book in similar terms,
as an Ode to Dejection, written at a time when he was sometimes depressed,
but by no means always (see the discussion in the book for fuller
context).  I don't recall her making a larger argument about its
representing O'Hara's death drive (though I must admit I wasn't totally
following her talk).  That's why I couldn't figure out WHY Baraka thought
she was character assasinating a friend of his; I still don't really get
it.  (Not least because he seemed to have missed her talk entirely!).]

Michael Magee respondeth:
Andrew, thanks for this correction to my overzealous post, particularly
re Marjorie - I had somehow completely forgotten that disavowal from Poet
Among Painters.  Do you mind if I post this part of your email to the list
along w/ my revised comments?

Here's the thing about Marjorie's talk as I remember it: however complex
and nuanced Marjorie's position may be on the whole, what she did with In
Memory of My Feelings in her talk was suggest that, not only were O'Hara's
"selves" "ruses" but he actually did believe in the Romantic Self: that
finally his chameleon act is not much different than the Romantic attempt
to transcend the Ego: a tragic attempt indeed.  Am I not remembering this
right?  It seemed to me that this was her take.  And in order to do this
she completely misreads the end of the poem, neglecting the complexity of
the line "which I myself and singly must now kill" - "I" "myself" *and*
"singly" - he's splintered the Self again (in a comic mood one might ask,
"Who is Singly?"): "and save the serpent in *their* midst": there's
vertigo here for sure, sadness too, but *not* tragedy.  My sense was that
Baraka - who, admittedly, caught only what he wanted to catch from the
talk - was objecting to the sense of *restraint* -- the boxing-in O'Hara:
apolitical, moody, painter-centric.  And, remember Marjorier's take in
PAP, which I don't think has changed:

"During these years [1958-1962] [O'Hara] was especially close - both
personally *and in his attitudes toward poetry* - to LeRoi Jones, who
edited first Yugen and was later one of the editors at Kulchur.
*Yet* O'Hara had none of the revolutionary fervor, the prophetic
zeal of the Beats."

Baraka isn't mentioned in any substantive way for the rest of the book,
the next 200 pages.  How close "in his attitudes toward poetry" could FOH
have been in Marjorie's mind, given that after page 14 she drops the
subject?  One can say that the title reveals the specificity of her
subject, her theme: but, after all, the book isn't called FRANK OÕHARA:
WHEN HE WAS AMONG PAINTERS; it's implication is POET (ALWAYS) AMONG
PAINTERS.  (methinks too of Rivers "who started out as a jazz musician" a
subject not mentioned again, not the importance of race relations to his
work, unless I missed it.)

As we've talked about often, Baraka is nothing if not *rhetorical* in his
address; he sense something, and he intervened - it didn't matter, in a
way, whether he knew what he was talking about vis a vis Perloff's talk,
since all he was trying to do rhetorically, to my mind, was keep *his*
Frank O'Hara in the foreground.

        and there you
have it: an Epstein in front of a
Magee behind
a Perloff

Kevin Killian's Orono or elsewhere reports are
awlays so rich and wry and wonderful like
a more tender Hunter Thompson or Tom Wolfe on
lithium and franciscan charm.  I would not want
to officiate the battle between Baraka and Watten
but as one who has survived wheeler hall as an
undergrad in post free speech days when a Milton
class went up in smoke and tear gas and reaghan
was bombing the free speech streets, I "can see
where he is coming from."  People's Park, by the
way, still exists as crazed ludic space, in fact
I was playing some bball on a court there just
yesterday.
Nobody has ever called Johnnny Mathis a language
poet but he sure was great last night crooning
\twelvth of never and why did I choose you
with San Francisco Symphony last night--
still looking like an SF State track star
or Hegel's "beautiful soul" which he foreever
is

I talked over Jimmy Hendrix's Red House over yonder
with Detroit blues legend Johnny Bassett on the Amtrac
from seattle to Portland and had a comic runin with
the drummer from BB King band
"but nobody can play the blues like Blind Willy Mctell"
we all did agree

I was glad to see Kevin Killian new work in
Berkeley Poetry Review 25th Anniversary Issue
now called in subtitle "A Journal of Emergent
Poetics" which very well fits it

a journal Josephine Miles and I started up
in houses on Forest Avenue and Virginia Avenue
(still there too, but more ghostly)
in the post free speech days of Free Speech

Kevin, you are the heir to Jack Spicer
but more tender and less drunken

these are the praises, Rob Wilson

In response to several enquiries re: the below, I'd like to clarify a couple
of things.  First, if you're not reading at - or at least attending - the
Boston Conference, please refrain from sending work.
While the broadside series is open to all, my current focus is exclusively
on those reading at the conference.  If you're not reading at the
conference, you're still welcome to send work, but please wait until after
September 1.  Second, each broadside will NOT contain the work of more than
one writer; the deal is one broadside (3 pp.) per person.  Third, it would
be expeditious if submitted work were print-ready, or on disk, to cut down
on typing time.  Email submissions are okay, tho I can't be held responsible
for the usual problems involved in sending work this way, ie., shifts of
lineation, misreadings of quotation marks, italics & all that.
For contact info, see below.
Thanks, and see you there.
Stephen Ellis

Thanks to all who responded to my recent query re: Robert Duncan.

I am also interested in corresponding with anyone who may have studied with
Duncan at  Central Washington State College in Ellensburg, Washington
[1969].

Finally, I would also like to collect materials for a website I am now
creating about Robert Duncan.  The site will include biographical material
on Duncan, essays, and access to relevant links.  I'd be happy to include
essays on Duncan written by anyone on this list, and I'd appreciate it if
this information could be forwarded to others with an interest in Duncan and
his associates.

Thanks,

Again I had Hobson's Choice on Friday morning, June 30th, but
certainly I felt fresher than most-bodies were littered all around as
though after a tornado after the all-night party that had engulfed
our dorm.  Should I attend the panel on b.p.nichol, George Bowering,
Fred Wah?  The three Canadians giving the papers on these men were
new found friends-sunny and smart and (okay, in the case of Scott
Pound, dark, glowering, shaved-head-bald and sexy) and ordinarily I
would have listened eagerly to anything they had to say.  But what
about the George Oppen panel that featured two fine and wizard pals
Stephen Cope and Alan Golding, plus another fellow I didn't already
know?

And plus, a pesky angel on my shoulder kept whispering to me, I had
promised Barbara Guest I'd go to "her"panel and scurry back home and
fill her in.   There was a Robert Lowell panel which, if it didn't
sound good, had that New England rectitude I'd travelled thousands of
miles to get a purchase on.  And what about "Points of Resistance?"
I never did find out much about that one.

Why indeed was I up so early and sitting in the front row at a panel
on "Black Mountain and St. Mark's"?  In a building undergoing
asbestos restoration no less?  Every worker in the place was wearing
protective cotton masks around their lower faces, but no, we scholars
and conferees were mask free!  Why, Kevin, why?  Two words: Miriam
Nichols, who was giving one of the very few papers on Charles Olson.
Has Olson's stock dropped? Hard to believe when he used to furrow so
many foreheads in the 1970s. It takes today a brave woman to plunge
ahead into the waters of Olson, as Miriam did, to come up with a
fresh account of the "Special View of History" and its attendant
philosophy of reading.  But, had Miriam Nichols been speaking on
grooming French poodles, I would have been there in that same front
row.  Years ago I had met her here in San Francisco at the very first
Spicer Conference in the 1980s.  Now she seemed younger and more
stunning than ever (all that fresh air?) so that she seemed to be
channelling the glamor of Dorian Leigh in that Avedon picture with
the elephants. Every time she popped up in some exotic orange
ensemble she seemed fresher and more invigorated, and more unearthly.
Even her toenails, Dodie noticed, were painted orange. We declared
her our Maine "It Girl."  But, I also learned a lot from this panel
about the systematic exclusion of Blackburn, Di Prima and Oppenheimer
by the poets gathered around the St Mark's journal "The World" (from
Burt Kimmelman's paper) and then got a Gothic charge out of Daniel
Kane's primary research into the origins of the Poetry Project-pretty
explosive if you ask me. I can't paraphrase all the ins and outs, and
we'll have to wait for Mr. Kane's book on the subject, but apparently
St. Mark's Church began the Poetry Project by boondoggling a huge
($200,000) grant from the Federal Government earmarked to get Latino
youth off the street in the days of "juvenile delinquency." Needless
to say, the young people who flocked to the "Church" in its early
days were almost all white middle-class bohemians who had been run
out of the Metro and the Deux Magots. Ethical problem in accepting
federal money at the height of the Viet Nam war? Or was the thought,
if they spend it on us, they won't be spending it on napalm? Anyway,
Daniel Kane seemed a little conflicted about this, but I was lapping
it all up, thinking of the Church now as a kind of House of Seven
Gables, born in sin, dragging the sin behind it like the albatross,
real Goth and suffering through centuries, although as Kane pointed
out it has only been 34 years.

Lost in this Gothic fog I wandered right through the exemplary
readings by Fred Wah and George Bowering, worried about my own paper
I was supposed to give that very afternoon. Faces swirled around me,
pink and gray like Morris Louis paintings come to life. I plunged my
gaze into my conference program, studied the afternoon's offerings.
At 1:30 Lee Ann Brown would be presenting the re-stored, re-scored
print of Helen Adam's 1963 film Daydream of Darkness (with other
works of "poetic cinema"), with a new score.

It was great to have all these 60s poets in one place, but I wondered
about the backstage negotiations and how it shook out that these
particular ones appeared and other didn't.  One British poet had
already expressed his disappointment.  "I crossed the fucking
Atlantic and fucking David Antin isn't here!"  So I cornered an
organizer and asked him who they had hoped to get and couldn't.
"Well, Creeley, of course. Barbara Guest almost came, but postponed
til October. At one time we were almost sure we had Adrienne Rich."
Dodie and I nodded, fascinated, seeing how the addition and/or
subtraction of any one of these would have shifted the balance of the
conference in one nebulous alternate-universe scenario after another.
"Negotiations with June Jordan broke down," Deep Throat whispered (we
were leaning against a pole).  "John Ashbery, Ed Sanders, would have
been swell.  Ron Silliman. Joan Retallack."  We gave each other
knowing glances at the latter two--more poets of the 70s in the guise
of 60s poets. Not that it wouldn't have been great to hear them, see
them, hold them again!  Our informant coughed as a passel of
Canadians slithered by.  We pretended we weren't talking.  "And of
course many of the leading figures are dead.  Ginsberg, Dorn, Lorde,
Zukofsky, Plath, Oppen, Eigner, O'Hara, Schuyler, Niedecker,
Kerouac."  Race against time in the noonday sun of Maine.

"Daydream of Darkness" was filmed over many months in 1963 here in
San Francisco.  The film, about 25 minutes long, once had a
soundtrack (or did it?) (but perhaps a live track of a script of
Helen Adam reading to music by Pauline Oliveros) and, when it was
restored a few years back by the efforts of Kristin Prevallet,
premiered to a tragic silence which some in the audience found
oppressive.  Since I thought it was fine in silence, I didn't know
how I would like the new soundtrack, composed recently in New York by
a group including Lee Ann Brown, Beth Brown, Nada Gordon, Drew
Gardner and Kristin herself, but happily the new music track works
supremely well, following the vague script outlines and featuring new
renditions of some of Adam's own poems and songs.  Wait till you hear
Nada Gordon singing!  She is like this eerie cross between Anita
O'Day and Linda Thompson!  Dodie and I sat there spines tingling up
and down with enjoyment and envy, because it isn't fair, it really
isn't, that she should have so many talents!  When the lights went up
I gathered my bags and scattered across the campus to join a panel in
progress.  (This form of attending, or seeming to attend, as many
simultaneous events as possible is, I learned, called "panel-hopping"
and was extremely popular last week in Maine, the draft between
speakers from the revolving door approaching gale force at times.)  I
rushed over to join up to the "Beat Women Writing" panel, but
unfortunately missed hearing the paper on Lenore Kandel and wound up
only at the very tail end of a paper on Ruth Weiss' "Desert Journal."
This may not be a familiar book to many of you but if you lived here
in the Bay Area and haunted the thrift shops like I do, you'd know it
was the book most often found on the poetry shelves there, it's
always that and some ratty old copy of John Brown's Body by Stephen
Vincent Benet and perhaps in the chic-er neighborhoods Thom Gunn's
"Man with the Night Sweats."  Anyhow Kristin who had also ejected
herself from the cinematheque took the stage to read her paper on
Helen Adam as fitting between Harry Smith's "Anthology of American
Folk Music" and Joan Baez's first album, but naturally keeping
herself at a distance from both poles.  An interesting discussion
followed, during which my heart sank a little since the audience
seemed completely conversant on every point I planned to make in my
own paper.  We were talking about the ballad genre and how freely it
became mixed with pop music at a certain point in US cultural
history, and how artists like Dylan and Baez seemed to "freeze" their
versions of folk ballad material to a point where no one now is
re-writing them to their own ends (perhaps copyright, that stern
Minerva, has impaled artistic freedom once again) whereas in only the
decade before, fluidity and potentiality reigned, and now, where does
a recording like that Baz Luhrman sunscreen thing fit in?  Kristin,
by the way, always looked colorful and to-the-minute stylish,
delivering her paper in elaborate shoes, clunky hip hop trainers that
practically bellowed, "You can take the girl out of New York, but you
(dot dot dot)."

Then it came time for my own appearance at the panel, "Dorn and
Spicer" (Alan Golding said it should have been called "Cranky White
Guys who Loved to Piss People Off") which was held in a long, low
science type room with all the chairs mounted behind long flat tables
that stretched out for yards on either side.  Logically enough, as
the room filled up, I sat there eyes narrowed to count all my true
friends who showed up to hear me, Keith Tuma, and Charles Blanton,
and made up a little list of those former friends who had taken it
into their heads to attend the competition, which included yet
another panel on Oppen and Bronk (Bronk! I cried out to high Heaven),
a smart panel that travelled from Langston Hughes to the Black Arts
Movement; a Berryman panel ("Berryman!" I screamed out, like Ignatius
O'Reilly in that movie theater when they showed that Doris Day Rock
Hudson picture "Must he come back from the watery dead to disturb my
rest!"); a panel on experimental women writers & the big event, the
John Wieners panel with the man himself in attendance.  Or, I know,
some elected instead to take a nap, motor into town to buy more
liquor, pitch pup tents in Acadia National Park or just to get out of
the conference funk I had, with each minute, more mired myself in.
So making this little list I listened to Keith Tuma's paper on the
close friendship and literary retrievals between Dorn and Jeremy
Prynne, which solved a textual problem while admirably raising as
many questions as it purported to answer; and then heard Charles
Blanton talk about the geography of "Idaho Out," with all the kick
and pizzazz of the very latest in topographical studies.  I felt I'd
heard the last word on topos and concentrated instead on remarking to
myself how very much Charles Blanton resembles the actor John C.
Reilly (Boogie Nights, The Perfect Storm, etc., etc).  Then when it
came my turn to speak I simply shut everything else out and spoke my
1400 words--one word for every two miles it had taken me to get
there.  (If anyone wants a copy of my paper let me know I'll send it
to you via e-mail).

The next event was the reading by John Wieners.  Kathleen Fraser
recalled how when she ran the Poetry Center at San Francisco State,
many years back, she had invited Wieners to come give a reading but
heard nothing from him again until the day before the reading when he
rang the bell, suitcase in hand, announcing his presence.  When she
got back from work that evening he had a) re-arranged all her
furniture; b) tried on all her dresses and c) written a poem for her,
"For Kathleen Fraser and the Governor of the State of California."
On Friday I sat next to him in the front row and talked at him
blithely enough while he continued writing a special poem he'd
written.  He kept turning back and forth the pages of a spiral
notebook polishing it off.  In large capital letters it read, at the
top, "A MIDDLE CLASS VOICE."  John had several bags with him, each
one fitting into several others, and all to be dumped into a shabby
dark flight bag (that's what he called it, I'd call it a runsack),
together with some clipping about movie stars, packets of hotel
sugar, stubby pencil ends, scraps of worked-up paper, those
devotional renderings of dead saints we used to call "holy pictures"
when I was a Long Island altar boy, and each one had to go back in
its rightful place before he could give his reading.  "Kevin," he
said, "I'd like to remind you, I would like the full-face shot of
Edie Adams."  Halfway through Steve Evans introduction, Wieners put
the final period on his poem, capped his pen smartly, and lurched
from his seat, then strutted with aplomb to the podium, where various
copies of his books.  Some microphone confusion, but the reading
began with "A Middle Class Voice" then went on to include a pair of
book reviews as a gesture, I take it, to his academic surround.  One
was on the wonderful "Mr. Skeffington" by "Elizabeth," which I
remember better as that great Warners 40s film where Bette Davis is
the most beautiful woman in town and Claude Rains marries her only
because he's got the money to save her once-proud family from ruin,
and then she gets smallpox and he goes blind and he continues to
think of her as beautiful and she doesn't discourage him but he knows
anyhow, and she says, "A woman is beautiful only when she is loved."
Well, Wieners mumbled and grumbled through many pages of "Beyond the
State Capitol" occasionally raising his voice in an oratorical style,
but never for very long.  I had the feeling that many in the audience
were confused, some moved to pity by the waste of it all, other
cheered by Wieners' perceived control of his own performative style,
still others fascinated by the Walter Brennan-style grubstake
dishevelment of Wieners' "look" (his hair, for example, long hair
which looks like a rubber band is tying back, but no, it's just the
way it's been molded over the years) and most I think felt brushed by
something profound tho' hard to name.  I remember going to see, as a
youngster, the lectures of Maria Callas during her "master class" at
Juilliard and her once encouraging a student in some phrase or
another by actually singing it herself, and the look of surprise and
dismay that crossed her face, the mouth moving and the ears taking it
all in, and the brain registering who knows what wiggly graph of
time, grief and pride.  Well, that's what I was feeling anyhow
listening to John.

Afterwards they were all over him to shake his hand and or to renew
old acquaintance and he must have been feeling pretty good about
himself and about us.  I gave him the full-face photo of Edie Adams
and he found a place for it in what he called the "front" of his
flight bag.

I went next to the plenary session that Bob Perelman gave on Melvin
Tolson's "Harlem Gallery."  Not knowing much about Tolson, and in 45
minutes Bob managed to cram a good deal about the poem, but wow, he
had a handout with 30 or 35 quotes from the poem, and 45 minutes into
his talk, he was only guiding us through example 4.  His enthusiasm
carried him through however.  Michael Magee has reported the
denouement in which Marjorie Perloff, not persuaded by Perelman's
eloquence, averred her opinion of Tolson as a "minor poet."  On the
face of it I'm ready to disagree and take Tolson for a major poet,
but if the criteria are that Major Poet X has to have had influenced
other, later Major Poets who knows?  What's major anyhow (or why is
it so important)?  Tolson's utility to poetry may be in his extreme
example as modernism turned both inward and outward at the same
skewed moment--its difficulty matched only by its openings towards
the public and the "outside" it (agreed Perelman and Perloff) had
little hope of reaching while the 60s carried themselves on.  Now
that "Harlem Gallery" has been republished, it will be interesting to
see what happens to it during the next 10 years.  Apparently, like
ARK, all of it is written in lines completely centered down the
middle of the page--what's that about?  To me centered lines
foreground themselves and enough is enough, or maybe I've just read
too much Michael McClure???  Michael (Magee) has also given us a good
account of Lorenzo Thomas' paper on the Black Arts Movement so I'll
skip right ahead to the event I'd been waiting for all week, Carla
Harryman's staging of "Dutchman" by LeRoi Jones.

During the past few days we'd seen so little of Carla and of her
cast, for they were in continuous rehearsal, and having worked in the
past with Carla I envied her actors the experience they must, I
thought, be undergoing, the deep, deep immersion into a sometimes
intractable text so that, when the light breaks, it breaks with a
Vermeerian simplicity and beauty.  Carla had chosen a noticeably thin
cast--I mean literally, physically, Lee Ann Brown so supple and
small, Lorenzo Thomas as the narrator (and conductor) cleverly
playing both parts and himself so dashing and slender, and Steve
Benson, the veteran Language Poet and now Maine-based psychiatrist
who came to visit the conference, a happy reunion for me, for the Bay
Area lost a certain je ne sais quoi of gravitas the day he left us,
and Steve almost preternaturally thin playing a drunk strap hanger in
the NYC subway, weaving almost thinner than the strap itself he
clutched, and all this set off marvelously by Mark McMorris with his
solid dependability as the hero, Clay, a comfortable cuddleability
that Carla brilliantly worked with and against as the rebel psychoses
of Clay made themselves known during the brief 40 minutes of the
play.  But first there was the suspense, of course, that, owing to
the [friction?] between Barry Watten and Amiri Baraka of the evening
before, would the two empty chairs reserved for Amiri and Amina
Baraka be filled?  Carla held the curtain until the very last moment,
until the Barakas indeed made an entrance as dramatic as anything
that ensued, and then all eyes were riveted on the stage.  After
almost forty years, the play still holds up, albeit the extreme
violence with which Clay dismisses Lula (is that her name) has this
nasty overtone of misogyny maybe it didn't have in the original
production?  Carla chose to underline this ugliness by freezing
Lula's body across Clay's lap like a Pieta; a break out of theatrical
representation on a different scale than her other innovations.
(Maybe I'm wrong about this?)  Maybe, also, there's a little bit too
much of a Rod Serling feel to the very very end of "Dutchman," with
yet another white woman approaching Clay, so the audience feels, we
are in the middle of the twilight zone of endless repetition till the
cycle of abuse comes to an end?  If so, it had a period charm that
took us right back to the 1960s whether or not we wanted to go.  I
sat right next to Asa Watten who was videotaping the entire thing and
Asa, if you're reading this, I'm sorry I said the other day that you
were 13 when of course you're 15!  It seems like mere minutes ago I
was hauling you on my shoulders over and over in that sunny Mission
Street loft during the months of rehearsals for "Memory Play"!  And
also for implying that you had no other interest in the conference
than playing chess, for out of all of us, you were at the same time
the most engaged and the most welcome in every circle I saw you in.
But you will forgive me with the quickness of youth, I hope, love,
Kevin.

It might have been at the bar afterwards that one conferee, lacking a
name tag so I don't know who she was (or what was her speciality),
told me that she had read Dodie's article in the Village Voice about
our marriage, and what she wanted to know was, if I was a transsexual
(and her tone seemed further to ask, if so, what kind)?  I was so
flabbergasted I didn't know what to say!  Shut up for once, and all I
could say was no, I didn't even say, I wish I was!  But, shaken to
the core, I have to stop here now and won't even try describing the
rest of the events of Friday night, June 30!

Subject:      new novel by Joseph Torra
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Tony Luongo, the second novel in Joseph Torra's My Ground trilogy, is now
available from England's Gollancz Books. Like Gas Station, the first novel in
the trilogy, Tony Luongo explores the lives of a post-war Italian-American
family in an expansive and fast-flowing narrative.



        Praise for Gas Station:

"If words were lug nuts, Joseph Torra would spin them in ways the guys down at
the garage never dreamed of"
                                                New York Times Book Review

"the storytelling has a wonderful sense of imagination, intelligence, economy
and originality"
                                                Hubert Selby Jr.

"the poetry of Gas Station comes from the more prosaic rhythms of speech, and
its meaning lies in the disjointed yet recognizable shape of everyday
experience"
                                        Los Angeles Times Book Review



* Tony Luongo is not available in American bookstores, but can be ordered
on-line through Amazon.Co.UK. and other UK book sites.

**The opening section of Tony Luongo appears in the journal Pressed Wafer #1.

Ron

I just learned that Ursule Molinaro died today -- she was one of us -- a real
writer who refused to compromise.  She was also a fine artist.  But for me
she will remain one of the most astuce numerologists.  One evening in a
restaurant in the village [I think Marianne Hauser was there too -- another
one of our great cotemporaries] Ursule deciphered for me the numbers in my
name and she told me the whole story of my life - -past present future.  She
was not read enough.  But perhaps now she will be.

I feel sad.  I don't know why really.  I didn't know her that well.
  I read her some.

I hope ABR will make mention of her changing of tenses

you may even print my little statement above about her as an homage to her.

Hi all, I'm back again, revisiting the Tolson issue: you'll remember that
I gave Marjorie short shrift (sp?) in my first post for, among other
things, calling Tolson a minor poet.  I've already tried to dig myself out
of a hole by saying better what I meant re: the O'Hara/Johns talk and
Baraka's peevishness.  Now I'd like to deal a bit more extensively, tho
not too much,  with the Tolson issue.  As Kevin's apology to Asa Watten
reveals, one writes these posts so fast that there can be much
unintentional glossing-over which appears to be pure snub (though Kevin
probably has less to lose by glossing Asa's Orono experience than I do in
glossing Marjorie's!)  Any-hoo, I should have added in my original post
that a) I overheard what Marjorie said in a *public space* within earshot
of the whole gang: no sense that either I was sneaking a listen or
Marjorie and Bob were concealing their conversation - the various
conversations by the bar, incidentally, were all like that - people
wandering in and out, changing the course of the conversation, etc, a nice
thing; and b) that what Kevin said regarding the issue of *influence* as
part of the Major Poet criteria was also part of the Marjorie/Bob
conversation.  Here's what Kevin said, followed by a few thought of mine:

[Michael Magee has reported the
denouement in which Marjorie Perloff, not persuaded by Perelman's
eloquence, averred her opinion of Tolson as a "minor poet."  On the
face of it I'm ready to disagree and take Tolson for a major poet,
but if the criteria are that Major Poet X has to have had influenced
other, later Major Poets who knows?  What's major anyhow (or why is
it so important)?  Tolson's utility to poetry may be in his extreme
example as modernism turned both inward and outward at the same
skewed moment--its difficulty matched only by its openings towards
the public and the "outside" it (agreed Perelman and Perloff) had
little hope of reaching while the 60s carried themselves on.  Now
that "Harlem Gallery" has been republished, it will be interesting to
see what happens to it during the next 10 years.]

I take my lead from what Kevin says above, to wit: why is it so important?
- as Kevin suggests, it's not very important and what I like about his
post is how this admission leads to an emphasis on *utility to poetry*:
what might one make of Tolson's hybrid language games, what might one
borrow, employ?  No one, of course deals in major and minor in our day
like Harold Bloom and Bloom of course does indeed predicate his separation
of said terms by emphasing influence and its attendant anxieties which
lead to productive misreadings blabbetyblabbettyblah.  Lord knows we
shouldn't have to bring up the fact that if a book is out of print it
can't be productively misread by very many poets.  But, for instance, I
can see a poet like Kasey Mohammad or Jennifer Moxley or Mytili
Jagannathan going to town with Tolson - since his metholodolgy dove-tails
with their interest in, speaking generally, taking traditional forms and
rhetorical structures with them into  either outer space or the 'hood.  In
this sense, Tolson is arriving at precisely the right time as these poets
really hit their stride.  Which is why I say, hooray for Melvin Tolson!
and expect to see him and all my favorite young poets in Bloom's next
book.  Affectionately,   -m.

    This is all so interesting.  If I may make an attempt to link this well
worn business to something more substantial . . . .  The list, it seems to
me, has thrust us backwards to a time where letter writing was the default
mode of communication (when face to face was impossible).  But it goes
further than that--the simple letter was essentially a "one to one
correspondence."  The list is more like posted proclamations for the
township, but strangely in this case written by the members of the community
(not the king) who remain "essentially" anonymous--writing directed at
everyone/no one in particular from someone/no one in particular.  Even the
signature appears in this forum as a textual tic rather than an entrance into
real flesh and blood personhood.  Most of us, after all, have never met.
Derrida said as much--that the voice was contained by writing in the sense
that speech must obey the rules of the sign system in order to make
meaning--the self as linguistic event.  What we have here is writing that
"intertexts" with writing.  "Strange how the older I get, the smarter my
father becomes" (replace "father" with Derrida).  Does anyone actually appear
on this list?  Yes, precisely--anyone.  Best wishes to my fellow texts--you
are an important part of me.  In fact, you are I.  And thank you Dillon for
your brilliant support of the poststructuralist project!  Signed, Bill Austin
(who is who?  who lives where?  who feels how?  who desires what?  Etc.)

Precisely--and there is no freedom from rhetoric--as Ecco's Misreadings clearl
y implies (despite what he may dream privately or publicly).  Unless we
believe in some sort of pure form, a writing that is not a writing.  How like
Plato!  How romantic!  By the way, loved your pastiche of right wing research
tools.  Used your construction to make a point--your construction as it turns
out, not you (since no one is entirely in charge of his/her own
construction). Best, Bill

Please excuse this addendum.  But for the sake of accuracy--in my last post
re: Moderation and Immoderation, I wrote the following:  "'Strange how the
older I get, the smarter my father becomes' (replace "father" with
"Derrida")."  Hope I got those quotation marks down correctly; I doubt it.
Anyway, I meant to add that when we replace "father" with "Derrida," we
should also draw a line through the word "Derrida."
There--now I feel better.  Best, Bill

Maroon is not merely a mispronunciation of <<moron>>; it's also an
"Americanization" of <<cimarron>>, wch means wild or savage.  Combine that
w/ the sense of maroon that means to be put ashore on a desolate island or
coast and left to one's fate, and you get a being whose idiom is always a
little "off"."  Sort of like a quantum theory moron - unpredictably off his

Kevin Killian's account (of all three days but his account of the third
is extra terrific) should be published.  I want to urge Steve, Ben, and
Burt to run it in SAGETRIEB--it is absolutely a gem all the way,
beautifully nuanced and vivid, especially about Wieners!  That was
indeed a great moment!  I also think Kevin's remarks on Ed Dorn (in the
paper he wrote) are worth publishing there so all can read (and
debate!).

As for Baraka, O'Hara, Tolson:
I didn't pay much attention to Baraka's charge against me since he
obviously didn't hear the talk or came in 3 minutes before the end.  And
I've puzzled over the last line of "In Memory of My Feelings" these many
years--I may be wrong, as Michael Magee suggests, but it doesn't really
change the thrust of the argument which neither he nor Baraka had
anything to say about.  During the past year, in honor of the O'Hara
show (in LA, Ohio, West Hampton), there's been much linkage between
O'Hara and Johns (by myself included) and my thrust here was to show
that, finally, their aesthetic diverged and that (I believe), Johns's
own works are subtly critiquing O'Hara even as he pays homage to his
revered friend.  And that critique looks ahead to the shift in mood in
the later sixties--when O'Hara was already dead!  That's why I end by
talking about Johns in 1968.  This in no way undercuts Frank's wonderful
poetry but its particular tonality, I would argue, couldn't last.

In regard to Tolson:  it's worth bearing in mind that Allen Tate and
John Ciardi (the Establishment critic of the period) extravagantly
admired Tolson even as they disliked Langston Hughes.  I believe they
saw in Tolson a relationship to post-Poundian (seemingly) poets like
Delmore Schwartz and, in a different vein, Parker Tyler.  Schwartz is
now virtually unread but his long ambitious poems have curious
connections to Tolson.  Both are interesting poets but I maintain that
the "major" label has more to do with identity politics than anything
else--the proof is in Michael's reaction:  I am scolded for what he
overheard without any real commentary on Tolson's poetry as if to say,
anyone who doesn't tow the current party line, man!, had better look
out!  Imagine Perloff having the gall to say what she did to Bob.  She
must like John Crowe Ransom!  The irony here is that Tate, who so
praised Tolson, is of course Ransom's sidekick.

As for the LeRoi Jones/Frank O'Hara relationship, I think it's well
worth investigating fully and I hope Michael's paper on the "5 Spot"
(which I'm crushed to have missed, had to go to another session at that
time) is part of a longer study of same.

I don't know anything about the bugs bunny version of the term, but maroon
is also used to refer to fugitive slaves who set up communities that
subverted and distrupted slavery by harboring other fugitives,
planning rebellions, stealing food, etc.  Houston Baker discusses
"marronage" briefly in _Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance_, p. 76-79,
referring to Richard Price's _ Maroon Societies_, in case anyone is
interested.

Stacy Doris
Paramour
Krupskaya
ISBN: 1-928650--05--8
$9
134 pp.
A freewheeling manual on the intoxications of love may seem a poor career
move in a day when Victorian mores and sexual disease have sent everyone
willingly back to a public, post-60s sexual civility.  Doris faces this
challenge by going over the top, with an excessive, polymorphic romp through
the many permutations love can inhabit, and in the meantime finds that
off-stage, rarely-seen space where aesthetics and titillation meet in
lascivious embrace. As she writes in her introduction, her task --
influenced by the "current technological unconscious' restructuring of
space... in which locations and identities shift with radical illogic" --
was to explore, primarily through palindrome, the "demonstration and
distortion of many kinds of lyric verse" and "human sexual response." What
results is something both mythic (in the spirit of the Satyricon), medieval
(with its gothic complexity) and somewhat late-Enlightenment (in the manner
of Sade, exhausting all possibilities but that of God's existence).
_Paramour_ is a landscape strewn with figures -- ballads, eclogues, prose
poems -- from the cultural tradition who meet again and again in a large box
of mirrors to revisit their amours: "Pipe drives the kids wild, / Piping
sprinkles bright goo, / In a cloud of chewy fluid, / And Pipe laughing sing
to all: / 'Pipe a game about a toy!' / So kids pop with happy guns. / 'Pipey
peek in fun again;' / So shoot too to tickle here." (4) Like Lee Ann Brown's
_Polyverse_ (Sun & Moon), Paramour skids through a variety of formal poses,
transmitting its carnal logic through pun and prose, epigraph and song -- no
stone left unturned in its quest for momentary satisfaction: "Get all fuzzy
Gets all mixed / when your body feels so rich / and in me But in its / so
fully seeps all destructs / may a new / a hand's more than / in all, more
in!" (7) "A Four-Tongued Version" from the chapter "How to Love" is a
beautiful long sequence of shorter, quatrain poems that are like versified
fortune-cookies, each one either a sharp, beguiling puzzle, some kernel of
"wisdom", or a telescoped narrative: "While she slept / he suffered her
sister. / Whose weather / could be nicer?" (20) Included is a calendar of
valentines -- one poem for every day of February --, a manual of love and
war based on the writings of Sun Tzu, several pages that seem like games
(her last full-length book of poems, _Kildare_, took place inside a video
game), all of which walks the cusp of this book's question, which is: can
form itself be the only content, or must it ever point to a "moral,"
ideological stance, or philosophical pose to justify itself? Doris's book is
both refreshingly free of the sentimentality of love but, as well, free of
much of psychology most of us -- in less extreme moments -- identify with
it.

"What gets _me_ is / the robots are doing / _my_ job, but I don't get / the
_money_, / some extrapolated node / of expansion-contraction gets / my
money, which I need / for _time travel_." So Davies sets the tone in his
long-awaited follow-up to _Pause Button_ (Tsumani, 1990), a comic, but often
melancholy mix walking the thin line between the absurdity of having utopic,
progressive aspirations and a survivor's guilt in a world of opaque,
socially indifferent economic commerce -- indeed, of having a value-system
at all. Like many younger poets from the west coast of Canada, Davies'
poetics derive from the cross-roads of "projective" speech-based verse --
his challenging, never imprecise cocktail of alternating line-lengths,
swift-moving fragments and page-splattered stanzas are its noticeable traces
-- and language poetry, which unapologetically divorces the fragment from
constraints of organic form, plunging each unit of the poem -- rhythm, word,
punctuation -- into the realm of social critique. What strikes one is the
elegance he brings to project; not a line is wasted, not a "white space"
trampled on by some ego-driven drive to sully emptiness with authorial
presence: "Yet / what if there is a perfectly natural / form, and god wants
us to kiss it and talk dirty?" (49) The long central poem, "Karnal Bunt", is
a sequence of single-page arrangements hanging, like a Calder mobile, just
tenuously and balanced enough to maintain it tensions. But Davies isn't one
to fetishize aesthetic moments, as each line is spurred on its incisive,
informed comedy that would fail on HBO but cuts to the heart of the
post-leftist, cerebral literary community from which he emerges. "An edited
Scotch ambiance of translated Chinese reads to itself" -- a line punning on
Chomskian generative grammar and the synchronicity of global economies --
would not bring down the house on the Dennis Miller Show. "Untitled Poem
from the First Clinton Administration" takes the project a step further,
adding the note of _duende_ -- a sort of heatedness that runs up against his
constructivist leanings -- as a stream of invective aimed at the
NAFTA-flattened globe and its promise and pretensions: "They don't care
about the details but fuck with the structure and they'll crush your spine /
A shell of other people / Reflowered / Pressed into action / Figures of
demented nostalgia / With diplomas, credit histories / Unbridgeable gaps
where their eyes should be / The cramp as such / Because it is written /
Veins in the forearms of Satan / Like unanswered mail in a bag of donuts /
The entire earth / Trembles in the throes of its decision-making process"
(85). Davies' humor -- like the best of the counter-culture sixties -- aims
from the darker corners of the room, shattering the false light of economic
progress and globalization. Nonetheless, he is not without light himself,
bursting from the clashes of social contradiction and a not-defeated utopic
urge: "Why be sad? / Kissinger will die / before they can upload him." (49)
_Comp._ is one of the best books of poetry to have emerged from the
alternative American poetry scene in years, and is sure to revive many a
reader's faith in the possibilities of poetry to speak, construct, goad,
amuse, teach and, incidentally, survive the spiritual stasis of the present
time.

The Tapeworm Foundry

ISBN: 0--88784--652--1
68 pp.
$14.95 (Canadian)

Taking up the call of a global poetics infused with the criss-crossing of
information flow, a local poetics (centered around a Toronto as you've never
known it) and a need to communicate beyond the surface intensity of radical
form, Wershler-Henry muscles through a single-sentence poem of possibility
whose only punctuation is the conjunction "andor." Any strand of this text
-- a DNA fiber for a new world of controlled chaos -- propels the reader
through a corridor exquisite options and micro-narratives, like a Borges
short story compacted into the moment between breaths: "[...] andor realize
your imac is just a big tamagotchi andor design a transformer to use up
wasted ergs of energy from excessive pressure on electric buzzers andor quit
making art in order to play chinese checkers andor tattoo your poems on the
back of someone else but be sure to make no spelling mistakes anor prepare
to correct them in a different colour of ink andor do it all for the nookie
andor delete ambiguities and then convert to specificities [...]" Billed as
a "list of book proposals," Tapeworm is actually much more: a manifesto for
significant and/or excessive action in a world increasingly circumscribed by
middle-of-the-road politics, false notions of rationality and productivity,
and the infinite hunger of a technologized economy for all the good bad
(read: useless, fun, diabolic) ideas that the young, the disaffected and the
inordinately talented can produce. Tapeworm's various jabs at institutions,
the "bourgeois", the mainstream and closed ways of thinking are not to be
ignored; this is a book that revivifies the initial burst of excitement
Dadaism and other modernist forms created, but unlike much "avant-garde"
work today, it is not caught up in the self-satisfying, doxical terminology
of the cultural institutions -- schools, museums, even the cliques -- but
wants to reach out, to expand, to take prisoners and aggressively amuse
them. If the work seems juvenile and "easy," that's because the author --
who has conveniently been muscled out the back door by a totalizing process
-- has sacrificed the "difficulty" (often just confusion or a hapless shield
against obviousness posing as hieratic) of much experimental poetry today.
If there is an overriding metaphor to how this poem operates, it may be that
of information itself; at times, even the simple construct (an advance over
the conjunctivitis of much late "new sentence" work, including recent
portions of The Alphabet itself) breaks down as a subset of phrases
separated by "or" take over (here, in a rephrasing of one of Raymond
Queneau's projects): "[...] andor find ninetynine different ways to retell
the story of one man accusing another man of jostling him deliberately on a
crowded bus at midday but avoid all anagrams or antiphrases or alexandrines
or back slang or blurbs or epentheses or gallicisms or haiku or hellenisms
of litotes or logical analysis or negativities or permutations or proper
names or prostheses or spoonerisms or syncopes or surprise andor [...]."
Like all great literary works, Tapeworm presents some fundamental problems,
mostly centered around the meaning of useless discipline -- since this is,
if anything, a disciplined work (as his tourniquet approach to his Oulipian
cousin suggests) -- in world whose only avenues for progress -- personal,
social, and otherwise -- seem to lead inexorably into melding into the
corporate whole? This book raises suspicions about everything, not the least
of which is where the "author" of such a work stands, but perhaps, like in
the radical performative work of Beuys and Acconci, the author is the
gesture itself.

The exact idea:  HRC, a prima donna used to getting her way, decided to
attack Senator Edward Brooke, a Black African American, at the Wellesley
convocation ceremony because she had disapproved of his position - anti
rabble rousing - on anti-War demonstrations.

Bill, of course your reply is the classical argument against my attempt to=20
create a dialectic between writing and what is outside writing (I suppose,=20
the non- existent universe of the signifieds). My problem with this argument=
=20
is that it is tautological. If everything is semiotics, nothing is semiotics=
.=20
Semiotics itself is a word with a historical shelf life, with its own web of=
=20
illusions, which soon (and none too soon) we may discard. My even more basic=
=20
problem with your argument is that it denies Alice the ability to scream tha=
t=20
the queen's court is only a pack of cards, that one can awake from its sway=20
by choosing to do so. As a mathematician Dodson knows that a closed system=20
(of language, of mathematics) is like a dream (overstaying its welcome, a=20
nightmare). One can not argue with it; one can only wake up from it.

One further point: I don't think the anti-thesis of semiotics or=20
structuralism is post-structuralism, the framework within which the changes=20
in Barthes are seen (Derrida acknowledges this fact in relation to Foucault'=
s=20
treatment of Descartes but no further). I think these isms are variations=20
within the same system, the true anti-thesis of which begins with the=20
assertion (blasphemous no doubt) that "the signified as an indipendent=20
reality exists."

Let me try to put in plain English what I think Barthes' thrilling=20
originality in a few of his later essays lies. Barthes tries to create an=20
anarchic, nihilistic poetics which focuses on, elucidates, gives speech to=20
the "random" impulses of the pleasure principle, and which encompasses the=20
totality of the reading or photographic experience, including the mind's=20
wanderings from the page (the page or a photograph as a framed entity=20
disappears). He does so by creating an interior space of the mind's eye, a=20
meditative space, where the eye gets in direct contact with words. Because=20
the arrangement of words in this space is not rational, but extremely=20
tangential, the mind is forced into reverie around and across this words.=20
This space is the dialectical other, the Sufi space of divine light, the=20
"non-existent" realm of the "signified."

The idea of absolute equilibrium among alternatives is crucial in the=20
reader's meditative/improvisational entry into this space. In "Loyola"=20
Barthes points out that the last step in Loyola's steps of meditation is the=
=20
mind contemplating an absolute balance of alternatives, which forces the min=
d=20
to "choose" to enter the field/space of divine light. This is also the space=
=20
of Twombly's scribbles, of my "Io's Song," for instance, pieces such as=20
"Venezuela" or "Subversion of What Is Seen in the Visible." Particularly, it=
=20
is the visual/verbal space of photography. The signified is embedded in the=20
photographic experience because of its camera obscura structure, implying a=20
prior light, of "the other." A medium where words and the eye fuse, photogra=
ph
y is the dialectical anti-thesis of the semiotic language paradigm (whether=20
one calls it structuralism, post structuralism or whatever). It is the mediu=
m=20
which takes us out of it.

Let me make another claim: The treasure trove of "The Arcades Project" may b=
e=20
our central text for the next fifty years. Understood in its totality, in=20
true dialectic fashion, this book about Paris obliterates French=20
Cartesianism. I am not sure Barthes could have written his essay on=20
Eisenstein's film stills without W. Benjamin's thoughts on photography.


b) "Say what? You don't read campiness into Mythologies? (Not to speak of th=
e
erotics of the book on love.)"

You are right, Jordan. Now that you mention it, camp themes are in=20
"Mythologies" (American wrestling is one I remember. There must be others, a=
m=20
I right?). In his later writing, Barth relates them to the eye, to decoratio=
n=20
(Ert=E9, for instance). He gets rid of the earlier semiotic treatment. Thank=
s=20
for the congratulations about the book.

I always thought that Bugs' use of "maroon" was a deliberate
mispronunciation of "moron," but the OED has these interesting uses of the
word:

"1.  A large kind of sweet chestnut native to Southern Europe; also, the
tree bearing this nut.

2.  A particular kind of brownish-crimson or claret color.

3.  A coal-tar die obtained from the resinous matters formed in the
manufacture of magenta.

4.  A firework composed of a small cubical box of pasteboard, wrapped round
with twine and filled with gunpowder; it is intended to imitate in
exploding the report of a cannon.

5.  One of a class of Negroes, originally fugitive slaves, living in the
mountains and forests of Dutch Guiana and the West Indies.

6.  A pleasure party, especially a hunting or fishing excursion of the
nature of a picnic but of longer duration.

7.  A person who is marooned.

8.  To be lost in the wilds.

9.  To put a person ashore and leave him on a desolate island or coast (as
was done by the buccaneers and pirates) by way of punishment.

10.  Of slaves: to escape from service and take to the woods and mountains.

11.  To camp out for several days on a pleasure party.

12.  To idle; 'hang about.'"

But I think the "moron" mispronunciation is the most likely.

The person who'd know is Joseph McElroy. I would be a while back,
though. She had plays produced as long ago as 1960.

Levy sets out upon his poetic project with an ethics of observation and
agitation, setting out with no definable goals but with a quasi-Buddhist,
quasi-materialist calling to be in the world, moment-by-moment, recording
its contradictions and, when there is beauty, its necessity and how it is
learned: "A surfer in methodological self-consciousness / forward, not
permanent, sweet, not lasting / to wipe clear tihs screen with / some cloth
of disparity / What we will try to become, that labor / curious about each /
Not curious about God, or sexual mores." (69) The idiom in the long title
poem which takes up most of this book is somewhere between Williams'
Asphodel and the fluid, polyglot and cross-spliced rhetorical strategies of
Barrett Watten's Progress; Levy never sounds entirely like he's "speaking"
to one singular figure, but this poem-including-history seems poignant in a
way that suggests the Modernist, never entirley submitting itself to the
rigors of method or foregrounded structure.  Indeed, Levy is willfully
"transcendental," not minding to point the eye up toward a "God" or an ideal
otherness, even if it is one he doesn't choose to name: "Did you write the
great line to take everyone / to another earth," (69) he writes, and later,
as if turning directly on his Language poet heritage: "A philosophy of
pissing off the other side / abandoning the secular car / making and
unmaking time."(74)  Later, however, he takes shots at what might be called
the subtone of transcendental philoshophy in mainstream, class-defined
American culture: "A memory of light / The turd of transcendence establishes
a hillside estate: / Transcendence Hill Club / Croquet is the game of choice
for its ladies / All the members are ladies at / Transcendence Hill" (52)
The tone is primarily meditative, but occasionally the "news" breaks in (not
to mention the occasional Andrews-esque obscenity-as-direct-address) to
trouble the isolation of this mind.  The worst one can say about the poem is
that its politics, when they take center-stage, seem undeveloped; one
section riffs on potential lines of a Nixon biography (as if Nixon, and
later Kissinger, were the figures most needing debunking in the world
today), and some targets for a sort of name-calling include the GOP and the
Democratic National Convention ("Troglodytes and Neanderthals"), the NRA,
and the military, while passing up the contradiction inherent in some of the
Protestant "good-works" philosophy of the poem --  the Poundian "make it
new" -- and their linkages to the basic power structures of these
institutions.  But as a whole, "Paper Head Last Lyrics" along with the
beautiful essay "An Indespensible Coefficient of Esthetic Order" -- with
their guerilla attacks on the problematic rise of "virtual realities," and
hence virtual moralities, in a de-spiritualized America -- presents the
image of a complex, invested mind at play among words, and with a poetic
ability that is rare.  Levy, with his very readable, honest and public new
book, is one more proof of the continuing validity of writing in the
modernist tradition today.

Canadian poet Karasick continues her pop-inflected, extroverted and
libidinal investigations into a deconstructive, pun- and =
anagram-motivated
poetics in her most visually compelling, if somewhat overdone, book.  A
high-end production -- one of the few books of poetry to boast full =
color,
glossy pages through most of its contents -- Karasick uses photographs,
drawings, multiple typefaces, the classic spatial accoutrements of
"projective verse" and just about the kitchen sink to propel her words
across, under and on top of the page.  The sequence "Menaheh Yehuda" =
treats
the syllable as an erotically charged node or synapse, as each word is
jarred forward by the phonemic contours of the preceding, trashing any
notions lyrical cleanliness and opting for the morally "obscene" =
literary
enactment of flesh-against-flesh: "And, as normative tilts ooze in a
choreography of tropic / blot clotters / a cotillion of many cullers,
isolata eros swigs in / blunt pulses & skins the surface of / her =
dimpled
limits / fermented in riggish gashings / grasped in spronged frottage
ruffled fetchings / fraught with h=E2ute conduits." (23)  "Improbable =
Grammars
V" takes the "wall" (or, at times, specifically Jerusalem's Western =
Wall) as
its theme, a center around which Karasick assembles, with a Benjaminian =
nod,
tons of quotes and images involving historicity and reading.  Though =
this
seems the most labor-intensive section of the book, it is probably the =
least
successful, as a series of what have become postmodern cliches -- the
language of fissures, simulteneity, non-linear and paratactic grammar,
virtuality, multiple identities, puns using parenthetical le(tt)ers and
s/lashes, dislocations, etc. -- abound, and the cumulative effect of =
the
clashing color images and attention-deficit typefaces -- technicolor
dreamcoats for the prose of the unadorned letter -- begin to strike one =
as a
good idea gone awry, or going nowhere in particular.  Some of the most
difficult passages to physically read don't yield much news, though =
often
the contrast of theoretical language and the slap-happy graphemes =
conspire
to create some intriguing hermeneutic whirlpools: "Exposing the =
fullness of
speech, s/he mouths (muths) all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and
becomes the writ(h)ing, the wound, the word.  S/he swallows, devours =
and
rends the world apart and at the same time (as a s/cite for ingesting,
assimilating) becomes one with the wor(l)d thus, with a collapse of
interiority, s/he transgresses herself and becomes an assemblage of =
surface
disruptions." (56)  Perhaps, as an example of tossing everything =
against the
"wall" of the page and seeing what comes back, "Grammars" is successful =
as
an exhibitionistic, youthful, and near-hysterical display of ambition =
and
desire, though a more thoughtful, specific experiment, with the goal of
aesthetic solutions for the new technolgoies (in the manner of =
MacLuhan's
books, or the Coup de Des) might have been more satisfying, and perhaps
monumental.  However, Karasick's energy can be infectious, and Dyssemia
Sleaze is unlike any book of poetry published recently, turning its =
back on
(and turning over) the more conventional, nearly sanctified values of =
both
the lyric and the visual poem (mired in its own traditions), and in the
meantime looking toward the future.

Have been greatly enjoying the varied takes on the Orono conference that have appeared here -- and Kevin, I especially want to thank you for telling me what John Weiners said in his reading -- I was only able to make out three sentences of the whole thing --

couple more quick notes:

Baraka was indeed elsewhere during Perloff's plenary talk -- It seems that somebody more mischievous than accurate told him in the hall way that O'Hara was being dissed inside, which is probably why his "bedbug" curse was preceded by an "if" --

The "Pimping" remark made after Watten's talk was likewise preceded by an odd distinction between second person plural and singular, though, as I remarked to any number of fellow conferees, if anybody was trying to pimp the 60s for a better job they were standing on the wrong corner up there in Orono --

On Tolson -- the influence he had on others is not at all hard to locate -- see Baraka's preface to WHYs, or William Melvin Kelley's letters after the Fisk Writers Conference, or Jayne Cortez, etc etc etc -- and (ahem) one MIGHT read "Melvin B. Tolson and the Detrritorialzation of Modernism" which forms a chapter of WRITING BETWEEN THE LINES by that Nielsen guy who refused to attend the lunchtime continuation of the Watten/Baraka fest out of sheer pique and hunger --

AND an extra thanks to each of you who kindly gave me a lift back to the Black Bear at day's end

and maybe the reason that only one person claims to have mentioned the name Don L. Lee is that everybody else called him Haki Madhabuti?

and THANKS to all plenarists and concurrents who gave me enough leads and citations to keep me busy for the next several months -- some great papers and fine friendly debates --

Hello all --

        Not sure if such a thing exists, but I'm looking for a good
anthology of poetry suitable for high school students that costs (wait for
it) less than ten dollars. Does anybody have any suggestions?

Amen to Marjorie's comments on Kevin Killian's memoir that was so incredibly
delicious and almost better than the Orono conference itself that I feel was
probably the best conference I've ever attended. I didn't hear a bad paper
and all the poetry readings were marvelous (even Wieners' that I could
barely hear in the back of the room) affairs.

As for Tolson--I confess to not having read him (I am ordering Harlem
Gallery and plan to read it carefully)--Bob Perelman's useful presentation
of HG for this first time reader of the work brought James Joyce to mind.

I am still excited by a few brilliant papers I heard and by seeing many
people in the flesh, but perhaps most of all I now look forward to Tolson
(as well as to a thorough reading of Ronald Johnson, and also to some work
related to papers by Dean Taciuch and Peter Middleton on science and
poetry).

Hi John,

Molly Schwartzburg and Stephen Ellis are both correct and erudite regarding
the word "maroon."   I feel, however, that in this case Bugs Bunny's use is
straight from Manhattan and has nothing to do (intertexuality and polysemy
aside) with fugitive slaves or pirates forced into early retirement.  Bugs
also pronounces "idiot" as "idjit" and "imbecile" as "imbesilly."  This is
all part of the early Bugs' NY origins (revealed in a number of cartoons -
see "A Hare Grows in Manhattan") and corresponds to many of the Warner
animals and characters speaking with a NY accent.  It may have been the
vision of Tex Avery, the later Bugs directors, or, it could have been the
idea of Mel Blanc, the voice for most of the Warner characters.  I hope this
adds to the discussion.

Regards,

Pete Balestrieri

                                    JULY 22nd 8pm ARTSPEAK GALLERY




                                    JUDY 3 is:
                                    CHRIS WALKER  AARON VIDAVER  REG JOHANSON CHRIS TURNBULL  PETE MEDWAY  BOB

                                    Judy 3 is an ongoing writing and publishing project that examines the role
                                   of traditional print formats in the formation of our identities as readers
                                   and writers. Through uncoventional design and packaging strategies Judy
                                   proposes a critical reading of the formal qualities of “the journal” and the
                                   creative practises it perpetuates and excludes.

                                    Smothered in layers of transparent sealant,  Judy 3 contains the work of 8
                                   writers and their response to editorial “demand” in the form of deadlines,
                                   assigned topics, and space constraints. Through their reworking of images and
                                   quotations culled from architectural texts contributors address the roles of
                                   restraint, ergonomics, product display, natural history, and pedagogy in the
                                   ordering of our lives as consumers and producers of culture. By turns
                                   sarcastic, ambiguous, incomprehensible, and ethereal, Judy 3 assumes an
                                   awkward posture in response to the competing imperatives it embodies.

By Saturday morning our horizons started to shrink, as we noticed=20
that all panels, formerly held in many different college buildings,=20
were from now on to be given only in one building, "Corbett."  With=20
this miniaturization of scale we began to notice that some of us had=20
slipped away.  Maybe a cue from the popular TV program "Survivor"?=20
Anyway on Saturday at 8:30 I was up and at em, moderating a panel on=20
Lorine Niedecker, with three panelists all of whom came, as I did,=20
from California-Susan Dunn, Tiffany Shockley and Elizabeth Willis.=20
Is California the center of the Niedecker nexus now?  One version of=20
it anyhow.  Susan Dunn pulled out a terrifyingly thick stack of large=20
index cards and proceeded to read Niedecker as a nature writer in the=20
vein of Rachel Carson or Aldo Leopold or Thoreau.  What was=20
interesting most about this reading was the specificity of detail La=20
Dunn was able to dig up concerning particular legal and societal=20
challenges faced by Wisconsin environmentalists in the 50s and 60s.=20
She showed a rare (library) copy of "North Central" that had the=20
bibliomanes in the audience drooling, asking us to consider it as a=20
work not only of collage but of recycling (I think).  Liz Willis's=20
imaginative take on Niedecker concentrated on that one poem, oh, what=20
is it called, but you will remember there's a watcher in the woods=20
who comes out from hiding to witness a church wedding?  Anyhow Liz=20
connected this poem (and others, like "For Mary Shelley") to=20
Niedecker's use of two Hollywood films, James Whale's Universal=20
"Frankenstein" and Clarence Brown's "Possessed" (from MGM).  (Is the=20
final line in the woods-wedding poem "Possessed"?)  Both films oddly=20
date from 1931, evidently a banner year for moviegoing in Fort Dix.=20
Liz related the plot of "Possessed" insofar as it presaged certain=20
events in Niedecker's own life so of course I warmed up to this one=20
quick.  Joan Crawford plays Marion, a lowly assembly line worker in a=20
Midwest paper box factory, who hungers for excitement and gets same=20
when she meets wealthy playboy attorney Mark Whitney (Clark Gable).=20
He's married though, so out of the deal all Joan gets is a fabulous=20
penthouse and wardrobe and a ruined reputation.  You can see a)=20
Possessed is a pre-code movie and b) the Niedecker-Zukofsky story=20
laid bare?  At any rate the strivings towards glamor and the high=20
life we sometimes miss when we read Niedecker's work.  How about=20
Crawford's later film from her Warners noir period, remarkably enough=20
also called "Possessed," where she has that insanely strange crush on=20
Van Heflin and his whole family, breaks down to primitive theremin=20
soundtrack, winds up staggering through the streets of Los Angeles=20
with amnesia.  Isn't this the Niedecker of the bewildering "For Paul"=20
poems?  I'm kidding.  Kind of.

Also at Corbett were the next two plenary sessions, Albert Gelpi's=20
discussion of Levertov and Duncan, and Lynn Keller's survey of the=20
early poetry of Kathleen Fraser, Fanny Howe and Rosmarie Waldrop. I=20
'm afraid I had to slip out of this latter one a bit early in order=20
to gobble down some lunch before the main event, the long awaited=20
debate between Amiri Baraka and Barrett Watten.  It was first of all=20
strange that the only place that could be found at short notice to=20
stage this debate was the cafeteria itself, where we had all spent so=20
many convivial hours introducing ourselves to Maine cuisine such as=20
Whoopie Pies.  And in the middle of lunch hour too, so it reminded me=20
of Civics Day in high school, or even earlier, that school where you=20
brought in 3 cents and they gave you milk, but you're too young to=20
remember that.  Tables cleared, Baraka and Watten sat down, with Ben=20
=46riedlander and Maria Damon (moderator) nearby, to tackle some of the=20
issues raised in the heightened space after Barrett's talk on=20
Thursday, "The Turn to Language after the 1960s."  Well, I don't know=20
what to say but it was extraordinary.  Two terribly brilliant men,=20
well matched in oratory, and with the stakes raised about as high as=20
they could go.  And yet Baraka's contestation, that Watten-and by=20
extension almost everyone in attendance at the Conference-had judged=20
the 60s a "failure" for one reason only, to achieve safe,=20
respectable, cowardly bourgeois careers in academia, was on the face=20
of it a difficult one to prove, though it did make for some lurid=20
headlines.  Before long the debate had become a series of Socratic=20
jabs, as Baraka made Watten back up before every statement to define=20
his terms.  "What *is* Language Poetry, can you answer me that?"=20
"And that makes it different *how*?"  So the audience was pressed=20
back, back, further into the original terms of debate.  This might=20
have grown boring had not Baraka often varied his approach with a=20
different kind of questioning, sometimes jocular and comic, sometimes=20
wildly improvisational.  We learned that despite all his faults Allen=20
Ginsberg had been an anti-imperialist poet ("Fuck you America and=20
your atom bomb") until a certain point in his career where Baraka had=20
found himself reluctantly parting ways with his comrade.  Ginsberg=20
had fallen victim to the proto-Fascist Chungpa Rinpoche who had=20
stripped W S Merwin and his wife of their clothes and forced them to=20
appear naked.  Ginsberg had also gone *too* gay to the point where he=20
came mistakenly to value gay liberation above the liberation of all=20
peoples and the anti-imperialist struggle in general.  Still, Watten=20
had no right to defame Ginsberg as he had.  This take on Ginsberg=20
seemed at variance with anything Watten actually had said about him=20
and, I can tell you, wasn't getting much sympathy from me.  (I had a=20
sudden fantasy of directing my own production of "Dutchman," in which=20
the main characters would be played by LeRoi Jones and Frank O'Hara,=20
O'Hara as Lula, the older, vivacious, sex-mad white woman of the=20
Homintern who must, finally, be punished for her Personalist=20
importunity.)  The talk grew most heated over the point about which=20
percentage of Language writers were now academics.  All of you, as=20
Baraka thought?  Or "3" as I heard someone call out from the=20
audience.  (This issue will, or so I take it, be more fully explored=20
in Andrew Epstein's investigative article soon to be published, is it=20
in "Lingua Franca," anyway one to which I'm very much looking=20
forward.)  And hadn't, Watten asked, Baraka himself taught in the=20
university system?  All of a sudden it was very strange and ugly, but=20
the tape will tell the tale and I believe all those interested in=20
this magnificent passion play should avail themselves of the=20
audiotape, then play it back yourself and revel in its drama and=20
sturm und drang.  At one point you'll hear Maria Damon ask Watten=20
which books of Language Poetry she could recommend to her students as=20
anti-imperialist, and he responded by describing briefly Bruce=20
Andrews' book "I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up, or, Social=20
Romanticism" (searching for the right title for it) and I asked him,=20
later, why he hadn't told her about his own "Progress," surely one of=20
the most beautiful, savage, moving and trenchant long poems I've ever=20
read.  Finally Barrett smiled and said, "You know why."

I left before the very end of the debate in order to catch the next=20
pair of readings, those of Rosmarie Waldrop and Kathleen Fraser, back=20
in the theater at "Corbett."  Waldrop read first from the charming=20
"Pro and Con" poem ("positions and junctions") and then settled into=20
the meat of things with several selections from her novel "Reluctant=20
Gravities," which she described as a series of conversations=20
interrupted by meditations.  "Basically it's prose poetry," she=20
hinted, and this made my soul curl up a little at the edges, since=20
the prose-poem mania that has infected the Bay Area has resulted in a=20
swarm of hideously bad writing of every stripe, but then as she began=20
to read I'm thinking, Oh thank God, this isn't prose poetry at all.=20
What can I say!  It was terrific, with real characters spouting a=20
kind of miraculously eloquent and unreal dialogue like the best of=20
Oscar Wilde crossed with the oblique strategies of Marguerite Duras,=20
and so funny it would make a corpse sit up and grin.  I could have=20
listened to it all afternoon, yet even while I drank it all in so=20
greedily I was on the other hand marvelling at the way in which=20
Waldrop's theatricality, that tiny, vulnerable, assured voice gave=20
one the illusion of being in the presence of someone really wise, as=20
though she'd had all the answers since birth and was dispensing them=20
with the generosity and fierceness of the Oracle.  A tremendous=20
illusion like watching Ruth Draper and seemingly so effortless you=20
knew it must have taken decades of practice.  On the other hand=20
Kathleen Fraser posed no answers, only more questions than you might=20
have ever guessed existed, in her equally fine reading from her=20
Selected Poems "Il Cuore."  A function, I guess, of the contingency=20
in her writing, where nothing at all is stable and all is predicated=20
on the swirling masses of political and psychic energy surrounding=20
the subject.  Again, she might have read these selections aloud=20
dozens of times before, and yet the awkwardness and difficulty of her=20
delivery--itself a skilled tonal gift--made them seem brand new as=20
though these had only just occurred to her, maybe last week.=20
Obviously I'm stressing the differences (between RW and KF) with too=20
heavy a hand, as though they were embodiments of Leslie Fiedler's=20
discredited "paleface" and "redskin," and obviously they don't exist=20
in this duality of warm marble and cooling lava.  But anyway by the=20
time the last notes of "Wing" issued out, and Jeanne Heuving was=20
dashing in front of Kathleen to perform this Marcel Marceau time is=20
running out gesture, several sides of my nature were well sated.  I=20
stumbled out into the bright sunlight and my God, there was David=20
Kellogg, having missed several days of the Conference apparently=20
while waiting for different planes to take off and having to sit up=20
all night in the Airport, finally arrived with his brother just in=20
time to give his paper at the next round of panels, a heroic voyage=20
for sure like the Relief of Mafeking.  But, there I was with my=20
cigarettes but no matches and I had to get into the car for the first=20
time in days and drive up to the IGA and get some matches, and some=20
more Tab.  Lee Ann Brown came with me and we idled away, feeling=20
vaguely guilty we were missing some important papers and panels, and=20
yet also with the divine sense of freedom that comes from such=20
devilry.  We discussed her performance of the night before playing in=20
"Dutchman," and then who among us in Orono was the cutest and/or most=20
available, and why it's really not wise to have a poet as a boyfriend=20
but on the other hand how other kinds of people don't really make=20
good boyfriends either, because they just don't understand, and=20
before we knew it we were back in the Parking Lot running into a=20
panel on, mmm, "Marginalities."

Unfortunately we must have missed Mike Basinski's paper on "Dangerous=20
Poetry of the 1960s" and wound up about halfway through Chris=20
Alexander's talk on Jack Spicer's "Billy the Kid."  I gather that=20
Alexander was coming at "Billy" via a series of approaches that=20
included, to my great pleasure, a discussion of Spicer's troubled=20
relationship with the Mattachine Society, so that on the one hand (in=20
the period) you had the uplifting and sentimental love stories of the=20
Mattachine and their literary movement (say, the stories in "One,"=20
the official Mattachine handbook/zine), and on the other, you had the=20
terrifying narrative of the Senate Subcommittees on Homosexuality=20
that tied gayness to treason (both forms of "weakness" inextricably=20
linked), and "Billy the Kid" somewhere in the middle: as a kind of=20
"realism"?  Lots to think about there, and then John Landry took the=20
floor and gave a paper on a poet I had never heard of before, called=20
Bob Lax.  Anyone within hearing distance of John at this conference=20
now knows the details of Lax's life, but for the uninitiated he's=20
still alive, extremely old, in some Greek island, Patmos I think, but=20
once upon a time he had been the best friend not only of Ad Reinhardt=20
but of Thomas Merton and Robert Giroux, and Billie Holiday cooked for=20
him in New York.  Not really a concrete poet but sort of.  Nineteen=20
films have been made of his life and work.  Having missed all of=20
them, I felt like I wasn't on the circuit, hadn't watched enough=20
films or maybe just too many Joan Crawford ones.  Meanwhile in=20
another room at Corbett, Dodie was moderating the first panel on=20
Plath and Sexton, and I gather that Susan Gilmore, who was that very=20
pregnant woman you saw everywhere so beautifully dressed, gave a=20
presentation that involved playing an actual tape of Anne Sexton's=20
late, derided entr=E9e into performance poetry backed by a rock band=20
("Her Kind") which captivated Dodie completely.  To the point that,=20
in the days since we've come back, Dodie has gotten in touch with=20
Diane Middlebrook and found out how to get her paws on the complete=20
unreleased tapes of this strange marriage of sound and music (Harry=20
Ransom Center, University of Texas Austin I guess).  (But first she=20
searched for bootleg copies on eBay.)  But these, the Lax=20
presentation and the Sexton "Kind" tape, were the kinds of paper that=20
I had missed, in a way, the revelation of something entirely new or=20
previously dismissed, shored up by research and discovery.  In the=20
men's room at Twitchell Village, to all kinds of noisome=20
accompaniment, Mark Scroggins related, in the perturbed tone of one=20
biographer to another, how he had attended every Zukofsky paper given=20
at the Conference, and while several of them were excellent, not one=20
of them revealed any "data," he said, pounding the urinal tap for=20
emphasis.  I nodded knowing just what he meant.

In the strange quiet--again, the feeling that we were being=20
abandoned, that we were shrinking, that people's rooms were empty=20
now, like Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None," I wandered=20
into Corbett again and into the theater space where, I realized=20
later, the Jay Wright panel was winding up, with Lorenzo Thomas=20
striding across the space fielding comments from the scattered=20
audience members.  Then Alec Marsh stood up and ended the session in=20
order to bring on the man himself, Jay Wright.  For crying out loud,=20
this guy is incredible!  And I really felt like a hick having really=20
never heard of him before a few months ago when we were beginning our=20
campaign at Small Press Traffic to bring Wright to San Francisco, and=20
giovanni singleton patiently led me through the details of his life=20
and career and all his glittering prizes, without once betraying by=20
nuance or gesture how ignorant I am of this particular strain of=20
African-American poetry.  (So obviously there's this double thing=20
going on here; one's hungry for what one doesn't know on the one=20
hand, and yet when confronted with that thing one's embarrassed on a=20
naked, primal level.)  Anyway, coming at this relatively late spot in=20
the Conference, Jay Wright's appearance was what we show queens call=20
the "eleven o'clock number," the electrifying star-making turn that=20
you need to keep your audience from catching their last train.  He=20
looked great for one thing, in this excellent suit coat and tie, and=20
he has one of those weary, amiable seen it all faces like Harold=20
Nicholas (only younger of course) (in fact watching him up close you=20
couldn't put an age to him, not really, I wonder if he ever was young=20
or was he like Dietrich the embodiment from an early age of great=20
emotional resonance and a timeless if ravaged beauty.)  They say he=20
doesn't submit to interviews any more, nor will he allow his work to=20
appear in future anthologies, and as you know from my coverage here=20
this kind of star trip always appeals to me.  His voice is remarkably=20
musical, and he can switch at the snap of a syllable from English to=20
Spanish and back so that the stage seemed filled with voices like=20
Prospero's island, and deeper and deeper into this world we sank so=20
when the lights came up again a great quake crossed our minds and=20
most everyone was drawn, like lemmings, down to the foot of the stage=20
where he, Jay Wright, prepared to greet his fans and sign copies of=20
his books, just I think for a closer glimpse.  He had a paper bag=20
filled with vintage copies of some early books, poof!  They all went,=20
just like that.  Standing on line to meet him was like standing on=20
line, as a child, to meet Santa Claus-I mean that magical and that=20
exhilarating and un-real.

I think I'll truncate my report at this juncture, though there were=20
many fine events and spectacles yet to come.  The lobster banquet,=20
the joint appearance of Michael Davidson, Bob Perelman, and Barrett=20
Watten, the "Fluxus" event arranged by Bill Howe, Michael and Natalie=20
Basinski, Keith Tuma and Lisa Phillips among others, during which=20
Bill Howe mimicked vomiting to an amazingly realistic extent and for=20
a really, really long time-mimicking the pent-up energy of the=20
audience, who'd been force-fed simply tons of information and indeed=20
booze for a week-and yet mocking us-and yet sympathetic to us.  One=20
final fashion award: Lisa Phillips for the most confident sartorial=20
panache.  When Kathleen Fraser laid eyes on her at the Fluxus event,=20
in her snug velvet skirt and skinny tank top, she exclaimed to Dodie,=20
"Who is that magnificent creature?"  Phillips delivered her paper on=20

Subject:      Accused of idiocy
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Because they address disparate matters, I'm dividing my responses into two posts -- For any who do not care to pursue a post on Dillonology, please look for a following short response to things Tolsonian --

Mr. Dillon writes as follows in response to my expression of admiration:

"There are no African Americans who are WHITE! I mean, DUH! Typiaal Liberal arrogance. Some of us have relatives from Rhodesia, Idiot.  My use of words is more accurate than yours."

Well, it is argued in many quarters that all of us have African relatives.  I know for a fact that I do, though not from Rhodesia.  I'm not sure why Mr. Dillon assumes from my first post that I am a liberal, and I leave it to others to judge which of us might be guilty of the greater arrogance.  I have sometimes been guilty of a certain arrogance, but I doubt that it could be accurately characterized as a specifically liberal arrogance.  I was, in fact, wondering how the word "black" was being used in your post.  If it was a designation of actual color, then you must never have met the good Senator.  If it was an indication of genetic origins, then why "black," since, as you so graciously and accurately point out to those of us too idiotic to have known it that there are "white" people on the continent of Africa?

But then, there is also this, received as an after thought from Mr. Dillon at my own e-address:

"And, one more thing.

You still want to kill the messenger rather than deal with the message.

The term "Black African American" is used properly and improperly everywhere.  But it isn't worth getting into Liberal race baiting here.  The point, Nielsen, is that Hilarity, who jumped from Conservative to the RadLib ship when she saw which way the wind was blowing, was going after an eminent MALE in order to carve a notch in her belt. Just as you are going after me to carve a noth in your belt. Actually, Senator Brooke was just a man, a person of quality who tried to teach a little truth that day, who was abused as Hilarity has abused so many others in her quest for power."

I'm not sure what has happened to Mr. Dillon's accuracy here.  His statement that I "still" want to kill the messenger seems to refer to some earlier correspondence, but  not any of mine.  It was an illiberal mode of race baiting I was worried about in my first post.  Mr. Dillon now tells me that "Senator Brooke was just a man," but it was for some reason important in his description of the Hilary encounter to let us all know that Senator Brooke was a "Black African American."

Sir, I knew Senator Brooke, and . . .

OK -- I almost paraphrased a Texas liberal there, so let me start again -- Just what was it about Senator Brooke's race that was relevant to what you had to say about Ms. Clinton?  And why is it evidently less relevant to you now that you've decided to berate me for raising the question?

And just how am I carving a notch in MY belt by going after you?  (and speaking of accuracy in usage . . . One carves a notch on a gun to indicate a victory; one notches a belt in a certain fashion to make it fit, but does one really carve a notch in one's belt, even metaphorically, to indicate another kill?) Just what is it that I have to gain, other than personal abuse from you, in pointing to what appear to me to be oddities in your intemperate remarks?

Having missed so much of the furor surrounding the initial appearances of Mr. Dillon in the lists, I had wondered at the level of response he was able to elicit in such a short time.  Having now benefitted from his corrective missives myself, I can well imagine how any number of idiotic, arrogant liberals might take offense at his gentle ironies.  It is seldom that we have an opportunity to learn from one as atute an accurate as he, which was, after all, the very point I made in my first post.  I suggest we all have something of importance to learn from the example of Mr. Dillon

Subject:      Tolson after Orono
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Just a couple quick quibbles.  I'm a little worried at the implications of Michael's comments about Tolson "arriving at precisely the right time as these poets hit their stride" etc.  This requires a seriously foreshortened view of Tolson's reception history.  Not only had he arrived quite forecefully upon initial publication (remember Williams's response to a Tolson appearance in POETRY, whereupon Williams wrote him into PATERSON!), but Tolson had a relatively wide readership, and affected a previous generation of younger poets, through the Collier paperback reprints of his last books that many of us read eagerly in the 70s -- BUT, that's the subject for an Orono 70s conference --

Then, to differ just a bit from my friend Marjorie -- I'm not at all sure that Michael's reaction is "proof" that the "major" label has "more to do with identity politics than anything else."  If it were simply a matter of identity politics, there are any number of other black poets for whom the claim of "major" might be made -- I would give the benefit of the doubt to those who think Tolson may be a major poet because of what he wrote -- But what I'm more concerned about is the suggestion that there may be a party line on Tolson.  As someone who's read everything that has been published on Tolson, I doubt that there is even a party, let alone a party line.  We have, at least, made some movement since the Shapiro/Fabio debate, and there are few left who, like Paul Bremen, think that all of Tolson's late work is a fantastic put-on -- But until there is considerably more discussion of the most recent re-arrival of Tolson, I think talk of a party line is premature --

(By the way, loved the slides, in whatever order they appeared -- They really helped me follow your argument)

This has come to an end; afterwards, I traveled more than 31 hours only to
have my suitcase lost between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City - I'm waiting
now for its arrival.

The trAce Incubation conference in Nottingham went amazingly well. There
were varieties of works shown and no showdowns. I found myself especially
interested in the groups discussing mobile technologies and the possibil-
ity of a literature dispersed among hand-held machines and users. I was
interested in the keynote talk given by Geoff Ryman based to some extent
on Sartre's What is Literature, applied to multi-media, developing con-
cepts of engagement, audience/writer trust and responsibility, and a con-
cept of a future leaving an already virtual reality behind. I was amazed
and moved by Belle Gironda's concepting of evanescence and much talk
throughout the concept of flow, which works in relation and through or
against the granularity of protocols. Somewhere Barthes seemed whispering
in the distance. I chaired a panel with, among other people, Linda Marie
Walker and Michael Tawa, whose mutual performance of quietude and def-
erral was astonishing. I loved the performative / somewhat Andy Kaufman
aspects of Bernard Cohen's presentation. It was great seeing and hearing
Chris Funkhouser as well - there is just too much to comment on, point by
point.

In all of this there was a sense of ground-breaking, dispersions of sub-
ject and object, exhileration, excitement, optimism, happiness. Stelarc's
laugh was amazing; the Walker and Tawa piece reminded me of Roy and H G.
I read Marie Damon's paper (I had too much to attend and wasn't able to
hear it directly) and suddenly the entrance of all of this into univers-
ity teaching seemed possible.

I wonder about the aesthetics here - I await a new aesthetics, a more
difficult accounting, both psychologically and philosophically, of changes
that are sea changes down to the depths. It's not the aesthetics, it's the
measure of being on the planet, of social responsibility and multicultur-
alisms, of protocols and regimes of analog and digital domains, of reals
and virtuals, of multiply distributed ontologies. It's the knowledge of a
future which, however fragile, takes the universe within poetics, and
takes poetics - in the broadest sense (Bachelard, Jabes, Blanchot, Kris-
teva, Barthes, etc.) - to a level of critial and relevant thought. And
it's the knowledge of future virtual subjectivities, and our negotiation
within them - as well as the knowledge of global relevancies, distribu-
tions of knowledge and wealth,

all these flows -

So the conference was, for me, also a waiting, and an awaiting-upon -

Alan, running on almost no sleep for days -

[First of all I confess I didn't know Richard Howard was the editor of The
Paris Review, a journal that has consistently rejected my own work, when I
wrote this; and when I decided to look up the person who wrote the foreward
to the book reviewed in poetrynow's latest issue before I risked offending
him, the temptation to not accuse him of bias and inanity was strong.]

The summer issue of poetrynow is online, containing poetry by MTC Cronin,
David Howard, Ross McMahon, Edward Morris, Bryan Murphy, Erin Sebo,
Lawrence Upton, Robert Wendland; and a review of the anthology The New
Young American Poets, edited by Kevin Prufer. In the foreward by Howard is
this somewhat inane statement: "Newspapers and magazines, the movies,
television, and now the Internet, the alarmingly identified WEB--how many
of these poems come to terms (and the terms arrived at are the poems) with
these promulgated emblems of ourselves!" I don't know what poets Howard
read, but the 6 poets quoted in the review come to terms not with some
declared, or even un-declared, "emblem" but most directly with life
itself--a life of conquerors and conquered, of change, of growth. And his
"web," with its suggestion of struggling insects and patient leering
spiders, forces us to wonder who Howard sees as entangled in silken
strands: the poet, the reader?

There are more and more fine poems being published on the internet, I like
to think that poetrynow is one of the venues where that happens.

This person is a genius. I am certain of that. He is as much a genius

Promissory Notes towards a Delivery of that Aesthetics of Multi Media

going back to winograd and heidegger, failure of technology, the non-work-
ing limits of the world - limits of the technology - what happens at the
point of failure, system resonances, micro-resonances - the splintered -
what does it mean to break ascii in ascii - recuperation always open at
the limit - limitless godelian axiomatic systems, as if there were a pro-
cess adding to their number - one that was carried out - the maw or gap/e
near the end - just about at the end - labia, the rim -
 get in the screen
towards that aesthetics -
 1 2 3 4 5
play, rapture, exhilaration, energy, collaboration, positivity, flow and
flux, emissions, dispersions, bodies and technologies, networkings and
membranes, words coalescing, breaking apart, cocooning and the coming-
together of individualized words, and the evanescence of worlds
 1 2 3 4
against the idea of multimedia, in favor of integration, convergence -
seamless (virtual) realities - not segmented modalities - dispersions -
bauhaus formulas of images - contrast between writing/fluidity and html
protocols -

(multimedia indicates a plurality - perhaps not only of channels, but also
of diegesis and affect - i'm stressing less rupture, less particulation,
and integration heading towards the seamless virtual or real)
   get out of the screen
(meanwhile html protocols and the net in general stutter, leave gaps -
you're always aware of uploading/downloading - as if the sprocket holes
were visible - godardian post-may-68 filmmaking - constructing broken and
self-reflexive diegetic)
   get out of the screen
inertias of html coding, stuttered inertias of the digital - continuum
mechanics of the analog necessarily embedding noise which tends to grow
exponentially - generations and generations of duplication and alteration
- it's like this, one might argue that there is an original text, and
everything that follows is either in error and/or in emendation - of
course that original is always already a plagiarism -
   get out of the screen
(stuttering railroad tracks against the ethos of the analog - the two
orders in dialectic without resolution, continual deferral - we have the
lost real and it is us)

but then again, think of multiple dispersions, hallucinagenic, without
separate addressing of the senses - it's this separate addressing that
leads us to think of multimedia - when things like film are coherent,
one doesn't think of them as image/movement/sound (only in afterthought) -
 1 2 3 4 5
a stuttered aesthetics, jump-cut length tending towards (degree) zero, the
affluence and surplus of the analog, the incisions, scarcity, of the
digital -

No......This varies according to one's e-mail software;  your name
does *not* so appear to some people (it did not appear as rendered by
my e-mail software) ;  that is why i suggest you put it somewhere in
the body of your post;  if it doesn't matter to you who yer speaking
with, and you don't care to make connections with what that person's
said  previously, ... well, how pomo of you;  it isn't true of all...

excerpted from the Arizona Daily Star article, written by Kathleen Allen:

Michael Cuddihy, a nationally known poet and poetry editor, died of
pneumonia Thursday [July 13] at his Tucson home. He was 68.

Cuddihy was founder and editor of Ironwood, a widely respected poetry
magazine he published out of his Sam Hughes [an old Tucson neighborhood]
home for 16 years -- an astonishingly long life for a poetry publication --
before folding it in 1988.

Cuddihy came from a prominent New York family, the publishers of Funk and
Wagnall's encyclopedias. He was a student at Notre Dame University when he
contracted polio. He was forced to drop out of school and would spend the
rest of his life in a wheelchair. His health brought him to Tucson in 1956.

He was a familiar figure at poetry events in town, sitting in his
wheelchair, a strap around his forehead to hold his head up. He had a long,
wispy white beard and an easy smile. When he listened to poetry, he would
fix his eyes on the reader, as though he were trying to pierce the poet's
soul.


[end of article]
___________________

According to a friend I spoke with this morning, Cuddihy had recently had a
tracheotomy, which was to help him breathe without regular mechanical
assistance for the first time in years. He had contracted pneumonia, but
was apparently recovering well. Then he simply felt a "heaviness" come over
him, and was gone.

His tower-of-strength wife, Mary Cuddihy, who courageously assisted Michael
for the last several decades, is also a great friend to poets locally.

Members of the Poetics List might know Cuddihy and Ironwood best for its
special issues, from the late 1960's through the mid-1980's, on George
Oppen, Robert Duncan, Beverly Dahlen, and Language poetry. His editorial
vision included poets as wide-ranging as those, as well as Czeslaw Milosz,
Linda Gregg, and Tess Gallagher. He had the widest, most open mind to
variety in poetry of anyone I've ever known, yet in his case, that openness
implied no lack of vision and high standards. He just had room for it all.
Personally, he was the most generous of poetic presences here in Tucson,
and at gatherings at his house one would become embroiled in fiercely
debated poetry discussions at one point, and listen to Irish jigs (and
perhaps dance to them) at the next. To see him out, whether at a poetry
reading, or when his assistant would take him for a neighborhood walk,
always lifted my spirits.

Goodbye, Michael, we will miss you.

I'm writing to announce the release of a new City Lights book by Paul
Hammond, Constellations of Miro, Breton. I'm the editor on the book,
one that I think many of the poetics list would appreciate,
containing as it does the complete English translation of some of
Andre Breton's last poems. And, as they say in the trade, much, much
more. Hammond's a remarkable writer and a brilliant translator.

You can find the book in the usual places. You can also order it
directly from City Lights (see http://www.citylights.com).

I'm including here most of what's on the back cover of the book.

CONSTELLATIONS OF MIRO, BRETON
by Paul Hammond
0-87286-372-7
264 pp
Paperback
$18.95


During the early days of the Second World War, the Catalan painter
Joan Miro created a startling series of twenty-three gouaches, his
Constellations, works redolent with the nightmare of contemporary
events. In 1958 the French poet Andre Breton composed his own
Constellations, a set of hermetic prose poems meant to
"illustrate"--that is, not simply to shed light on, but to lend
luster to--Miro's paintings, and to resume a peripatetic dialogue
about exile. In Constellations of Miro, Breton, Paul Hammond unravels
some of the mysteries of the call-and-response of these two
Surrealists by reading the pictures against the poetry, the poetry
against the pictures, and both against the madness of a history that
none of us has left that far behind.

Featured in this edition are reproductions of the complete series of
Joan Miro's Constellations and a translation of Andre Breton's proses
paralleles. Also included is Andre Breton's essay, "Constellations of
Joan Miro," as well as documentary illustrations and photographs.

Paul Hammond is the author of Marvellous Melies, French Undressing,
Upon the Pun: Dual Meaning in Words and Pictures (with Patrick
Hughes), and a monograph on Luis Bunuel's L'Age d'or. He is the
editor and translator of The Shadow and Its Shadow: Surrealist
Writings on the Cinema (coming from City Lights in fall 2000), and
the coeditor, with Ian Breakwell, of Seeing in the Dark: A Compendium
of Cinemagoing and Brought to Book: The Balance of Books and Life.
Paul Hammond's translations include Whatever by Michel Houellebecq
and The Virgin of the Hitmen by Fernando Vallejo.

Just wanted to quickly respond to what Aldon says above - he's quite
right, I sort of misrepresented myself in that early post (have you
noticed how much I've been doing that lately??).  As someone who's written
about Williams' inclusion of Tolson in PATERSON, I do of course remember
it (not that Aldon could've known this as its buried w/ much else in my
dissertation in the Penn library stacks and on my home bookshelf).  What I
was talking about was the *specific* effect that the republication of
HARLEM GALLERY might have on poet I know personally and who's work I think
some of the best going -- I had in mind a comment of Bob Perelman's about
WCW's KORA IN HELL arriving in print in the 70s almost as if it were the
contemporary of, say, Creeley's PRESENCES (my example).  So, I never
intended to obscure the reception-history of Tolson's work but, rather,
merely to respond to some of Marjorie's comments regarding his influence
but suggesting that, on a very local level, I can imagine some of the best
young poets around responding in valuable ways to HARLEM GALLERY.  Dig?

Murat--good to see you back on the list.  Well, I suppose we could go back
and forth with this until "semiotics" yields to another supplement.  I guess
I could say that if everything is energy, nothing is energy--but that might
get a few quantum guys on my tail.  I could say that if everything is real,
nothing is real, or at least that reality is a meaningless concept.  But I
think Derrida, and dozens of others have covered that one.  Come to think of
it, quantum theory might serve as a good wrap up to this discussion.  You see
a particle, I see a wave.  Depends on the tools we use, the questions we ask,
the answers we expect.  And yes, Alice is denied, as are we all.  But like
Carroll we are permitted to fantasize.  Your description of Barthes' "Sufi
space" may have some merit, but it's all too phenomenological and hocus pocus
from my perspective, and Derrida did his thing on Husserl a long time ago.
Divine light?  Cool idea!  Sure the mind wanders from the page, but language
never wanders from the mind.  What else is the mind, after all, but a
linguistic construct invading awareness?  That meditative space --what else
might it be if not the "distance" between meaning and non-meaning which
inhabits all texts?  In my view, Barthes is describing the gap that is differa
nce, in other words.  See?  Because I am suspicious of all
religious/quasi-religious/platonist/mystical strategies, I see a wave where
others might see a particle.

I must agree with you that the true antithesis to
structuralism/poststructuralism is some recovered version of Searl.  I
suggested as much when I conflated the two in a previous post.  But all that
is pretty old news.  Surely the terms of the argument will change over time.
But the argument will always be couched in words for us.  Isn't that the
point?  That language simultaneously banishes and reveals, mediates as it
re-covers.  The issue for me is not whether phenomena (a la Kant) occupy
space, but how that "reality" unfolds for us.  As far as I can see, it
unfolds as the signified, and that means it never escapes the prison house.
Neither do we.

But I'm probably wrong about all this.  Still a great admirer of your work.
And yeah, I agree with you that the jargonese has worn very thin.  Plain
english all the way.  Best, Bill

<< Bill, of course your reply is the classical argument against my attempt to

Semiotics itself is a word with a historical shelf life, with its own web of

illusions, which soon (and none too soon) we may discard. My even more basic

problem with your argument is that it denies Alice the ability to scream that

the queen's court is only a pack of cards, that one can awake from its sway

by choosing to do so. As a mathematician Dodson knows that a closed system

nightmare). One can not argue with it; one can only wake up from it.

Forgive me for posting again so soon.  But I feel the need to attach a
clarification to my last post.  When I wrote that "if everything is energy,
then nothing is energy," I was not trying to be flippant.  In fact, the
quantum guys might not find such a claim all that surprising, especially
those involved in matter/anti-matter investigations.  My point is that
Derrida has it covered.  Is it not the ur-space of differance that meaning
and non-meaning cohabitate?  I would argue that everything is semiotics, and
everything is not semiotics--the one claim carrying the trace of the other,
contingent upon the other.  This is far more than a simple binary, I think,
if one considers that the opposition only appears as such it we agree to rest
within easy polarizations, no doubt so that a rational discussion may ensue.
But all facile oppositions are masks, in another sense, since one side is the
other, the ghost of the other.  Murat, your stated desire to separate writing
from that which is not writing is the key to your position, I think.  I know
I don't have to tell you that when we speak of writing, we are speaking  of
far more than marks on a page.  We are referring to sign systems that
govern/express (to us, for us) all of human experience.  So I guess what I
find questionable in your remarks on Barthes is that you seem to cast him
among those who quest for immanence.  That throws us back to the old speech
is prior/writing derivative business that Derrida handled so well.  I don't
read Barthes as ever intentionally attempting to establish or re-establish
old hierarchies.  But I do think that earlier in his career he did it
inadvertently.  Anyway, I wanted to get all that out before you cream me.
Once again, it's great to have you back.  I've learned quite a bit from you.
Thanks.  Best, Bill

Dear Richard -

Your political analysis rides on the notion that somehow the clinton clan is
somehow 'liberal,' left,' etc.  i think there are very clear deficiencies in
such an analysis.  He's as right as any other republicrat out there.
there's a one-party system in america, and currently he's the leader.  if
you have doubts about this tight network of relationships and who these
people similarly represent, look into the long-standing relationship between
the gore and clinton families and the bush family (hint: the Harrimans).
These people all represent the same people and are playing the same game,
but they just all wear different masks.  Your divisions are entertaining,
Richard, at the very least in a traffic accident spectacle sort of way, but
they are also ones that better-informed people are often eager to reject.
in a way, rush limbaugh-esque rhetoric attacking clinton helps clinton
(remember rush is a bush crony, an experiment loosed from a psyop manual),
because it keeps the appearances of differences between the 'right' and the
'left' intact, and keeps that shared power between bushes and clintons and
the elites that they both represent intact.

americans don't necessarily want choice, but they do want to _believe_ they
have a choice, and they want to believe that they truly are given democratic
options, so that often makes them very fine dupes.

do you wish to be predictable?  are _you_ easily led?  these are difficult
questions, and those of us who are not vigilant in asking ourselves these
two questions ultimately ARE duped.

firing a gun at the bad guys when the bad guys and the good guys work for
the same people creates nothing but dead bodies and success for those people
who set up the puppet show at the outset.

THE MAROON is not as clever as you paint him.  You are.

The Maroon believes Paul Fray and his wife, Trooper Patterson, and writer
Oppenheimer that Hilarity is a BIGOT AND A BULLY.

You want to deconstruct THE MAROON and thus permit HILARITY her power over
you and the other poets in your school.  You would rather not deconstruct
Hilarity because such a truly radical act might perhaps cost you tenure.

Hilarity is a phony.  Tears are in her eyes now for she's been found out
because multiple witnesses from different stations saw her deliver cruel
words and have seen what she is.  Former allies who tried to help her would
not now lie.  Not unless something more important were at stake, something
irreplaceable, call it conscience, call it liberty.  Other former friends
and associated have passed away mysteriously as the Cyclone of the Clintons
appeared on the horizon of their lives, moved through, using them, catching
them up in vain idealisms, and went on its course. When Hilarity was
finished with the Arkansans they were 49th in education.  Rape after rape
had gone unpunished.  And the Lippo Bank, owned in part by Beijing Borg Jack
Booted Thugs (Their Tanks Once Stopped By The Maroon In Tiannamen Square),
had planted its first American outpost in Little Rock.

There comes a time when you believe one side or the other and then
afterwards the Truth will out.  THE MAROON, who gains no boon by this
endeavor, encourages you to trust him rather than the CLINTONISTAS.  You
will feel better on Election Day if you do not give them your power in
whatever State you cast your vote............ if you vote, which I doubt.

i wonder about the utility of labels like "major" and "minor" when it comes
to evaluating poetry and poets.  ive never found it helpful and it is most
often used to dismiss the kinds of folks i work on. so, nein danke.

This news was very saddening to me, as I had always planned to meet up
with Ursule Molinaro again in the scorpio haunts and hexagrams of the west
village, but this is not meant to be.  I was able to place a long-promised
review of her writings up on amazon.com of all places.  So look at it if
you care, or get a chance.  I can only add that Bruce Mcpherson of Tanam
Press who has supported artists of their singular caliber and poetic
syntax-- here I am thinking back to Theresa Cha before the Korean American
takeover of her identity, and of the cosmopolitical and uncanny
projections of Urusule Molinaro, virtual saints of the un-american
experimental crafts-- the likes of which are passing from the shelf life
world.

Yrs are the praises Ursule and your work will live on in the "afterlife"
of the writerly world where books are still read, taught, and appreciated
beyond the deadliness and flash of the commodity form. Rob Wilson

This announcement just in from Burning Deck Books:

Burning Deck is pleased to announce volume 4 of DICHTEN=3D=20
(a series of translations of current writing in German)

ERNST JANDL
reft and light
Selected Poems with Multiple Versions by American Poets
ed. Rosmarie Waldrop
Poems, 112 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 1-886224-34-x, original paperback $10
Publication Date: October 15, 2000

        Jandl's poems are so engrained in the German language that they are=
 impossible to translate. This volume presents an unusual experiment: not=
 one, but several adaptations are given for each German poem, so that the=
 original is encircled by multiple English analogues. The responses range=
 from close imitations to freewheeling versions that continue Jandl's=
 thinking into other semantic areas.

        Ernst Jandl was born in 1925 in Vienna. In German-speaking countries he is=
 regarded as the main representative of concrete poetry. _To jandl_ has=
 become a verb. He began publishing poems in 1956 and quickly attracted=
 attention as the wittiest and most exuberant of experimental poets, with a=
 knack for uncovering the comic potential in discrepancies between sound and=
 spelling, in cliches, mis-pronunciations, dialect etc. He has not only=
 explored the limits of language in his visual and sound poems, but has=
 written powerful political commentary by playing with Auslander-deutsch,=
 the kind of pidgin German spoken by foreign workers.
=20
        He translated Gertrude Stein, Robert Creeley's The Island, and John Cage's=
 Silence.

          Among his many prizes in both Austria and Germany are the=
 Georg-Trakl-Preis (1974), Georg-Buchner-Preis and Grosser =85sterreichische=
r Staatspreis (both 1984).

        It is with great sadness that we learned of Ernst Jandl's death while this=
 book was being printed.

        The translators include Charles Bernstein, Lee Ann Brown, Norma Cole, Tina=
 Darragh, Ray DiPalma, Rachel Blau Duplessis, Kenward Elmslie, Anselm Hollo,=
 Paul Hoover, Gale Nelson, Julie Patton, Ray Ragosta, Joan Retallack, Brian=
 Schorn, James Sherry, Cole Swensen, Craig Watson, Marjorie Welish, John=
 Yau, and others.

Uh, um, hey! my copy of the City Lights reprint edition of Kora in Hell has
"seventh printing October 1967" on the copyright page. The Scribners first
edition of Creeley's Presences is dated 1976. Kora in Hell originally
arrived in print in 1920, in Boston.

You guys are teaching literature? in colleges??

This is a "Notes & Queries" kind of posting:

Listening (repeatedly) to Nat King Cole singing "The Frim Fram Sauce"
(J.Ricardel & R.Evans, recorded 1945) I get as far as
"I want the Frim Fram Sauce with the awesome ...."
& cannot make out the next word: awesome what
does he want? & can anyone on the list please say
 what "Frim Fram Sauce" is & also "shofifa on the side"

Thank you for your friendly response.  I'll think on it for a few days and
then get back to you.  These are important considerations.  I take your

Demarcations

"Now, whatever is moist he created from semen, and that is Soma. All this
universe is food and the eater of food. For Soma is food, and Agni is the
eater of food. This was the surpassing creation of Brahma, for he created
the gods, who were better than him, when he, being mortal, created immor-
tals. Therefore it was a surpassing creation. Whoever knows this is born
in that surpassing creation of his." (from Hindu Myths, Wendy Doniger
O'Flaherty.)

Certainly Jennifer is surpassing, because Jennifer has been the longest,
takes all the time in the world, from the beginning to the end of time,
and has been wide-variety.

Certainly Julu is non-surpassing, because she is within Jennifer, and is
thereby lesser, occupying narrow-variety, and within a limited of time.

Certainly Nikuko is surpassing, because she is inspiration and breathing
and demi-urge meat-girl big-god, and she is everywhere and lives within
Jennifer but Jennifer lives within her.

But certainly Alan is non-surpassing, because he must write for Jennifer
and Julu and Nikuko, and his writing is the business of writing beings and
the Being of writing, and he calls this writing, wryting. And it is non-
surpassing because it dwells within him, choking him upon its vowels and
consonants and semi-vowels.

Now d'eruza is certainly surpassing and now d'nala is certainly non-sur-
passing because d'eruza borders and bounds and binds, and d'nala is
bordered and bound and bound by the arm movements of d'eruza, by the hand
movements of d'eruza, by the finger movements of d'eruza. So d'nala is
certainly non-surpassing and he is no wryting for d'eruza. Now certainly
Jennifer is surpassing for the wryting of d'nala.

This is the surpassing and the non-surpassing of being.

Of possible interest: I searched high and low for an out-of-print title by
Haitian-Canadian writer Dany Laferriere, and just when I was about to give
up, I finally found a copy for $7 through www.bibliofind.com. I have found
www.bibliofind.com a useful tool when searching for out-
of-print books.Bibliofind was acquired by Exchange.com, which was aquired by
Amazon.com, which is a downer, but when you order from Bibliofind you deal
directly with an independent book seller. Basically it's a consortium of
independent book sellers who list their holdings in a searchable database,
and when you find something you want you pay the bookstore directly and they
send you your book. (Bibliofind doesn't collect any extra fees.) The
bookstore who had what I
wanted is an outfit in Las Vegas that deals primarily in the "paranormal"
and UFOs! Who knows how Dany ended up there, but I found it amusing.
Bibliofind has rare collectors' stuff too, in the hundreds of dollars range,
but you can also find your basic books that you may have been searching for
unsuccessfully on the used-book circuit. I'm always glad when the Web has
something to offer that I actually consider useful (and no, I don't have a
stake in bibliofind!).If anyone has used this or similar services, I'd be
interested in hearing useful tips (or warnings).

that one can find for free in the public domain, and b) publications that
they don't actually "own."
I found Ph.D. dissertations from all manner of friends and acquaintances
(including folks on this list), plus chapters from copyrighted books
available "for immediate download."  I'm having some reporter buddies dig up
the dirt on this. Until then, you may want to go to this site and run a
search on yourself. You may be surprised at what you find.

Amazing, the alternative American poetry scene is so far out there it
doesn't even reside in America.  Please don't take this northern
intervention too seriously just be careful.

All the same, a wonderful review of what sounds like a dynomite book.

In response to W.A. Austin

  Well, another supplement.  I guess
I could
get a few quantum guys on my tail.
 I could say that if everything is nothing, at least reality is
meaningless
But I
think Derrida, too
phenomenological  hocus pocus

See?  Because I am suspicious of all
religious/quasi-religious/platonist/mystical strategies,
structuralism/poststructuralism
conflated

But the couch for us.  Isn't to (a la Kant) occupy
the prison house.
Neither.

But, I agree with you that the jargonese has worn very thin.  Plain
english all the way.  Best.

If raising questions about Hillary Clinton might perhaps cost us tenure,
will anybody be left to tenure?

I have a question:

Has anybody on this list ever met Richard Dillon in the flesh?  Is he a
real person -- the love child of G. Gordon Liddy and Lucianne Goldberg,
suckled at the breast of the late Ed Dorn -- or is he some persona created
for our amusement?  And if the latter, who would do such a thing?  Perhaps
one of the several list members who either left or were booted (memories
differ) over the last several years.  Or perhaps our own Chas. Bernstein,
who, some of us suspect, created an annoying list-member persona under
another name in the list's early days. Finally, perhaps "he" (Dillon) is a
not a maroon (tho he sings a Looney Tune) but a BOT, created by right-wing
programmers at the Drudge Report or freerepublic.com, a bot which strings
together right-wing conspiracy boilerplate as a parody of language writing
or the much-alluded to (by the dillonbot) Burroughs.  This last
possibility gains more credence with me every time I read one of the
dillonbot's posts.

Cheers,
David

Spanish poet Jose Angel Valente has died in Geneva. Born in Ourense in
1929, he is the author of many books of poetry and prose over the past 50
years or so. A kind of mystical poet in the tradition of San Juan de la
Cruz.  Also a translator of Celan and Kavafy and collaborator with Catalan
painter Antoni Tapies. He wrote mainly in Catilian, but also has some
poems in his native Galician.

Actually, the "alternative American poetry scene" that Brian refers to that
the Canadian writer is a part of _is_ inclusive of Canada and technically
could be considered "American" (if not in the way the word "American" is
most commonly used and understood) since Canada is a very big part of the
North American Continent.  If Brian had said "alternative US poetry scene"
then I could see why caution would be necessary.

I have had Louis Armstrong's version of that song since the 50s, and
i have been wondering some of tha stuff too. Even on Diane Kroll's
version it is hard to tell.

But I have never heard the word "awesome" , not even before its
recent meaning, which appears to be "pretty good." I thought he was
asking for the =E9toff=E9, which you do get in Cajun food.

I have always wondered what it was on the side. I mean I have been
wondering for 50 years. Sounded like "chuvabah" or something. Someone
in N'awluns tell us.

It resides in America, just not the USA. Why go along with people who
call the latter "America"? Why didnt they go the whole way and call
it "The World"?

Dear David,
my thinking exactly, was going to pop that question myself but it's such a
touchy one, sure to get the ire of those deniers of surveillance and
cointelpro activity.

Joe,

You're probably correct; I got carried away, and I retract that
association.  But I may have (mis?)remembered RD as making that
association himself.  Once in awhile, I think, he remembers he's on a
poetics list and throws in a name or two.  Not that I want to reread his
posts to prove this.

I also must regretfully announce that I have it on good authority that
Richard Dillon is an actual person, more or less.  So my hopes for parody
or a bot have been dashed.

Best,
David

co-incidentally enough, I came across some early work by Richard Dillon
about the same time that he appeared on the list - a number of poems in
issues one and three of Alan Davies' first magazine 'Oculist Witnesses'
- unfortunately have since lent these and so am unable to give you an
example, suffice to say the work was similar to Alan's pre-Lang days - a
kind of conversational lyricism, an everydayness with surrealistic nods
- It was fine - Saroyan, Mayer and some early Silliman and Watten in
same issues - certainly very different from the present noise - tho' the
response to Patrick's recent post seemed more promising - ready for
another mind shift Richard? Any other spottings?

I am pleased to announce an article about the Electronic Poetry Center in the
Information Technology section of the current issue of _The Chronicle of
Higher
Education_. The article is now available online if you go to
http://www.chronicle.com/
and click on headline, "The Bards of Buffalo".
I haven't seen the print version yet but I think that it will be slightly more
expansive, possibly including photos and/or examples of some of the works
discussed.
The article quotes a number of people familiar to this list.
It is great to see digital poetry receive attention from such an important
source!

<< Cauldron & Net, an electronic magazine of the arts and new media, is
 currently reading/viewing submissions for vol.II, no.II [from may 1 -
 september 15, or until journal is full]

 The guidelines are as follows:
 my [ideal] conception is: for this to be a showcase of diverse voices of
 the arts & criticism. i would like the focus to be on the creative
 process, i.e., i would like the submissions to be of ideas, concepts,
 notes -- not simply of finished (polished) pieces. the RAW is invited:
 works that may retain the edge of their (hopefully inspired) inception.
 this means the desire is for experimental work -- however obscure.

 nonetheless:
 the guidelines are very broad as cauldron & net is particularly
 interested in showcasing the wide variety of the diverse voices which
 may be found on the Net. that means that [almost] all is invited:
 literature, poetry, nonfiction [creative or otherwise],
 hypertext/hypermedia, theory, criticism, reviews, music, photographs of
 performance or other 'hard-copy' art,experiments, outlines /sketches of
 ideas, jottings, notes, proposals, research papers, sophistries, etc.,
 etc., etc. quality is really the only criterion [though of course such
 judgments are left to the discretion of a rather opinionated editor].
 programmers and computer scientists who have ideas and/or work that a
 'wired' laywo/man could grasp are [enthusiastically!] invited to submit
 also.

 simultaneous submissions and work that has already been published will
 be considered, although the preference is for unpublished work.

 please send all inquiries / submissions as e-mail attachments [as plain
 text in the body of a mail if you work on a Mac] or URL indications in
 the body of a mail to: cauldron@studiocleo.com

latest issue, & have been spreading the word. I want to query about two
pieces of criticism for you. The first concerns a review of the Prinzhorn
collection of outsider art, which showed at the Shoho Drawing Center in New
York, & is currently on display at the Hammer in L.A. I belive you mentioned
you were in L.A. The second is a discussion of the dance company Momix, with
continual reference to Wagner. I can make these conventional essays, or,
judging by your call, something more rhetorically off the beaten path, if you
prefer. Do let me know.

in my time in Pittsburgh, a bar called "Hemingways" had a regular reading
series of poetry & fiction.  the bar was in Oakland, the university
neighborhood, directly across from the Cathedral of Learning, the tallest
educational building in America.

if the Beehive is still going on, it's a good bet, too.  in fact, if the
Beehive is still going strong, give it my best.  as well as the Squirrel

I don't know about bots -- but -- I was just at that sixties conference, during which I discovered that David Kellogg is a replicant!  Both of him were quite nice, wonderfully and convincingly produced -- I think there was a paper at the conference that linked Dillon to Baraka?  oooo weeee ooooo, as Ed Sanders once said --

mike perhaps also has in mind the appearance of IMAGINATIONS from new
directions in 1970, not only reprinting (once again) the text of KORA but
also the original preface (for the first time since 1920 i believe), as
well as the complete text of SPRING & ALL for the first time since 1923.

................................THE LAWN CHAIR DRIVE-IN SUMMER
SCHEDULE...........

Hello!

THE LAWN CHAIR DRIVE-IN runs all summer long, every Wednesday evening at
dusk, in the Liberty Lands Park.  The park is located along 3rd Street,
north of Poplar Street, in the Northern Liberties Section of Philadelphia.=20
It has always been and will always be absolutely free.

Come alone or bring friends, picnic beforehand if you like, it is a
pizza-and-beer-meet-your-neighbors kinda thing.  THE LAWN CHAIR DRIVE-IN is
now officially a Northern Liberties Arts Association event, with a little
bump from the Northern Liberties Neighbors Association. =20

LAWN CHAIR DRIVE-IN SCHEDULE

July 19    DAVID AND LISA  1963
Kier Dullea and Janet Margolin play very disturbed teens who discover each
other and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  Great film.  Bad dreams.  Cool
score.

July 26    CHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND  1939
When was the last time you surrendered to the delightful hokeyness of
CHARLIE CHAN?  This is one of the best of the series.

August 2     SMASHING TIME  1967
Rita Tushingham and Lynn Redgrave meet Austin Powers' kooky friends on
Carnaby Street, the original boulevard of shagadelic dreams.

August 9     WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD  1933
William Wellman directed Frankie Darro and friends, struggling under the
thumb of the Great Depression.  Hey... a boys gotta do what a boys gotta
do... go wild!

August 16    5 CAME BACK  1939
A DC-3 airliner crashes in the Amazon jungle.  Only five make it out alive.=20
Will Lucille Ball or John Carradine or C. Aubrey Smith be among the
survivors?  Place bets between reels.

August 23    THE LITTLE GIANT  1933
Edward G. Robinson spoofs his LITTLE CEASAR persona in this terriffic little
comedy about a gangster crashing high society.

August 30    THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT  1964
Two teenage girls stalk avant garde pianist Peter Sellers around New York in=
=20
this delightfully subtle coming-of-age comedy.  A personal fave!

September 6    WILD CARD FINALE!
This is as much a groove soiree as a film showing, so come early and bring
all your friends and neighbors.  A fine finish to another great summer
season of free films in Liberty Lands Park.

There seems little doubt that the mere presence of so many diverse=20
demonstrators, operating peacefully but unpredictably, will create edginess=20
and tension in the city.

A full day, Aug. 1, likely will be dedicated to protests and undisclosed act=
s=20
 of civil disobedience in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on death row fo=
r=20
 killing Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981. "We're not her=
e=20
 to disrupt," said Pam Africa, a leading Abu-Jamal advocate.

Police Commissioner John F. Timoney said he was confident police can maintai=
n=20
 order with large numbers of officers in vehicles and on the street, in =20
plainclothes and in uniform. Mobile units will be moved to trouble spots as=20=
=20
needed.=20

All recent presidential conventions have drawn some protests, but this year,=
 =20
with activists energized by the protests in Seattle during the World Trade=20
Organization meeting in November, many more groups intend to demonstrate at=20=
=20
both political conventions.

They say they will be chanting, marching, even mud-wrestling to get=20
attention, some using puppets, floats and, in one case, 60,000 shoes to make=
=20
their points.

There will be people targeting the Republicans directly (on abortion rights)=
=20
and others who just want attention from the 15,000 journalists.

Some angry Democrats from Camden say they will use the occasion to picket=20
Republican New Jersey Gov. Whitman.=20

For the anti-corporate crowd, campaign finance and the role of big donors in=
=20
the political process will be among their main issues. Some say they will=20
attempt nonviolent but disruptive actions to make their points.

One direct-action protest organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity,=20
said the surprise efforts may include protesters chaining themselves to=20
shuttle buses, unfurling banners from high-rises, or mounting impromptu=20
blockades of delegates' hotels - a protest plan that they expect will lead t=
o=20
a cat-and-mouse game with police and lots of arrests.

Timoney has asserted that the department will do whatever it takes to=20
maintain order, but he expressed hope that it can be done without violence.=20
Tear gas and clubs to quell demonstrations are "last resorts," he said.

Even if there is no violence, some demonstrators are almost certain to be=20
arrested, and arrangements have been made for cells to detain them.

The police and demonstrators have spent months planning how to outsmart each=
 =20
other. Activists are assembling medical teams, bringing in food trucks, and=20
scouting out dozens of buildings or vacant sites where they can sleep and=20
prepare their protests without being stopped by police.

Protesters with all kinds of causes will find a forum at the largest=20
scheduled rally, called Unity 2000, on July 30, the eve of the convention, o=
n=20
the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Its organizers have quietly urged radical =20
protesters to take a break from direct action, letting Unity 2000 concentrat=
e=20
on its peaceful gathering of scores of "progressive" groups, ranging from th=
e=20
AFL-CIO and the NAACP, to the National Organization for Women and the HIV=20
activist group ACTUP.

The mass rally will feature an 80-foot-long float called the "Corpazilla,"=20
which will include a wrestling ring filled with mud and grapplers dressed as=
,=20
of course, Vice President Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.

Another contingent may be dressed as an "army of cockroaches," said Matthew=20
Hart, an activist and founder of the Spiral Q puppet studio in Philadelphia.=
=20
He said cockroaches symbolize the great unwanted disposable masses getting=20
stepped on by the powerful.

Unity 2000 will have a South Jersey contingent, which wants to march across=20
the Ben Franklin Bridge on Sunday - on the sidewalks, without blocking=20
traffic - to raise its voice on campaign finance, suburban sprawl and=20
homelessness.

Welfare, housing and the plight of the homeless will be the focus of a week=20
of events staged around the city by the Kensington Welfare Rights Union. The=
=20
group intends to build a tent city called "Bushville" on July 27 for homeles=
s=20
protesters.

The group's founder, Cheri Honkala, declined to say where Bushville will be,=
=20
saying she feared police would move to block it. But she said it would be=20
populated by up to 1,000 people "who used to be homeless, are homeless, or=20
will be homeless."

Honkala said the group also intends to take visiting journalists on a bus=20
tour of Philadelphia's most run-down neighborhoods, "what we call the realit=
y=20
of Philadelphia."=20

Honkala said her group's efforts would culminate with an attempt to block=20
midday traffic in Center City on July 31 with a march down Broad Street from=
=20
City Hall to the First Union Center, site of the convention.

"This is by far the most insane, and definitely the biggest, thing we've=20
done," said Honkala, a veteran of many protests, who added that the=20
protesters are prepared to be arrested.

Scattered around the city during the week, groups sparring over abortion=20
rights will host their own events, working against one another.

"Generation Life," an activist crusade led by the Pro- Life Union of=20
Southeast Pennsylvania, hopes to bring several thousand students and young=20
protesters to Philadelphia for conferences, prayer vigils at abortion=20
clinics, and a rock concert in the days before the convention.

"The theory is try to get younger people involved in leadership roles," said=
=20
Mike McMonagle, an antiabortion organizer.

In reaction, abortion-rights groups say they plan a rally of their own on=20
July 30 and will station activists through the week at Planned Parenthood=20
clinics in Philadelphia and West Chester, to act as "escorts" for women=20
entering or exiting.

A group called the Silent March, which advocates strict gun controls, said i=
t=20
expects to display 30,000 pairs of shoes at the Liberty Bell on July 29 and=20
30, symbolically representing the number of people it says are killed with=20
guns each year.

The Second Amendment Sisters, a group of women dedicated to protecting the=20
right to bear arms, have applied for a permit for a counter-rally.=20

The Liberty Bell may be the most peaceful and most intriguing protest spot.=20=
A=20
group called the Oral Majority, initially founded to advocate gay rights,=20
will set up there all week to showcase its new cause: lifting the sanctions=20
against Cuba and reforming immigration laws, organizer Robert Kunst said.

Then there is the designated protest zone near the First Union Center. About=
=20
20 groups have applied so far to get one of the 64 time slots - lasting 50=20
minutes each - available during the four-day convention. The groups range=20
from Virginians for Immigration Control, to the vegetarian group Kicking Cow=

workshops, teach-ins, love-ins, direct action trainings, eating and creative
loafing on the eve of the Republican National Convention. PDAG will offer
workshops throughout the day and throughout the city on dozens of topics,

* Front line media
* Street first aid
* Medic and CPR training
* Self-defense for women
* Puppet building
* Blockades
* Classism
* Campaign strategy
* Creative direct action
* Globalization for beginners

And come for teach-ins on zillions of topics, including...
* The case of Mumia Abu Jamal
* The Zapatista uprising in Mexico
* The racial wealth gap
* Radical labor organizing
* Political prisoners in the US and around the world
* Colombia, today's dirty war

For information on workshops, contact the PDAG Training Working Group
(Skylar
Fein, Training for Change, 215-729-7458, skyfein@aol.com).
---------------------------------------------------------------
Workshops will run July 24-30, from 9:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily.  The main=20
workshop space will be the CEC, 3500 Lancaster Ave, in W Philadelphia.  Maps=
=20
at the CEC will direct you to the 5 or 6 other locations in the neighborhood=
=20
where more workshops will be going on simultaneously.  So drop by the CEC fo=
r=20
the full poop!  Hope to see you there...

A PLACE TO STAY IS A-OK!
------------------------
Let's say you have a four bedroom house in Center City with more room than a=
n=20
average Boeing vehicle assembly building. Or, perhaps, you live in a
200-square foot room in South Philly. Either way, some dedicated activist
from out yonder wants to crash on your floor. We still need lots of housing
space. If you do anything positive for the movement this weekend, let it be
this: contact Nicole at nicolemeyenberg@aol.com about giving up some privacy=
=20
in the name of toppling the status quo.

THE MEDICAL AIN'T HYPOTHETICAL
------------------------------
The PDAG medical working group is looking for medics to staff direct action=20
during the RNC. This is an extremely important position, ripe with
responsibility! If you are a medic, or know anyone with medical training,
please contact Dave at epicac@gateway.net. Do not delay. Do not pass go.

Hi all,

Artists Lisa Adams and Jill Giegerich have formed a collaborative artmaking
team called the apocalypse twins. Check out our website at
www.apocalypsetwins.com. Our first project is called I AM UNARMED. This is a
T-shirt designed to raise funds for the upcoming protests at the Democratic
Convention this August in Los Angeles. If you would like to know more about
these protests go to www.D2KLA.ORG. You may take a look at and order our
T-shirts from our website.

We have also created an installation for a group exhibition at the Patricia
Correia gallery in Santa Monica, California. The installation is entitled
"Here is Something Strange". The exhibition is called "A Collaboration". The
address is 2525 Michigan Ave., #E-2 (at Bergamot Station) in Santa Monica.
The artists' reception is Sat. July 29 from 5 - 8 PM. The show runs from
July 29 - August 30.

-Jill Giegerich

Back when I lived in Pittsburgh (almost ten years ago
now) the best person to see re the Pgh poetry scene
was this cat Richard Dillon.  Former secretary for
Burroughs, tireless promoter of others' poetry (as
well as his own), organizer of readings by locals and
national figures, and beat gnosis repository haunting
the bookstores and bars of the south side.

Whether that's still true, I can't say.  I'd tell you
to go to Chief's Cafe, too, but Tony the bouncer's
dead now..altogether a different city.

Best,
John Beer

> Dear friends,

>
> You know who you are.
>
> AND YOU ARE THE MAJORITY!
>

>

DEAR LISTSERV.READERS:

I have been so disgusted w/politics until this past half hour when I received
an e-mail that just made me ever so slightly hopeful for this next
Presidential Campaign.
Please go to the following web sites for information on the Nader 2000 For
President issues no matter what your political world view is ... you will at
least be informed that we just may have a REAL choice this time round ...
just maybe ...

http://www.michaelmoore.com/aint.html

and ...

Ralph Nader http://votenader.org

Of course this is of the greatest difficulty; I am often aware of a cer-
tain condensation and intensity that occurs in these gatherings (the ones
I can afford or the ones that can afford me) - that the nodes that develop
are oddly unique in the universe - that there is no return, no recupera-
tion. At the Incubation conf. I took a number of digital photographs; we
all - there - breathed English (Midlands) air, for a moment together - DNA
minglings - then nothing - absence - I've got these digital imaginaries -
a kind of resonance. In an odd way this can be considered a type of
illness that appears - immune to antibotics - Alan

In response to my defense of him, I received a direct reply to my comments=20
from Doug. I would like to post his response and my second response to him i=
n=20
the list because I think Doug contributed significantly to the present=20
exchange of ideas. Since his letter includes separate responses to my=20
Shakespeare and Orono comments, I grouped them separately:


"Thank you Murat for your well considered defence. i have put a few
comments in their proper place in responce to your thoughts.

[]  no, the language is often quite entertaining--as language. (once, as i
launched into a complaint about A.pope, Jackson Mac Low explained to me that
Pope is one of the greatest sound poets in the english language. well that
is pretty much that no?) & as for shakespair, well, he's really a terrible
dramatist--his plots are on a par with George Lucas no? Mostly, i find the
shakespear industry to be stiffling & reactionary. {& before anyone responds
to this last sentence i would ask you to think of all those
uninteresting--completely authoritarian shakespear people you have met. & it
is an industry, these people sit on commities & bring their calcified brains
to bear on everything from higherings to course selection--& they are given
some eminence merely because they are students of the bard....well is anyone
suprised that i say BAH! Hamburg! ?} {ok on a similar note, wall of sound
might not be a bad thing, but i'd rather listen to strauss or ELO than
vagner.....}


Dear Doug,

I share very much your feelings (maybe in a more ambivalent way) about=20
Shakespeare as a dramatist. Except for a King Lear production I saw in Turke=
y=20
when I was a teenager and an As You Like it Production in London, I don't =20
remember a Shakespeare production which resonated for me as drama.=20

For instance, the pretense that Shakespeare's characters are speaking a=20
"natural" language is surreally ludicrous. In fact, to make Shakespeare's=20
plays alive one must accentuate their artificiality -maybe turn the play int=
o=20
a machine. Then, flashes of incredible beauty sneak out of them -for=20
instance, accentuate the baroque irreality of a handkerchief causing a murde=
r=20
in Othello. So ridiculous, but so breathtaking.

In other words, to get to Shakespeare's heart as a dramatist, one must dives=
t=20
"beautiful language" and "human nature" from it, H. Bloom's nonsensical book=
=20
about S. inventing human nature (or is it human emotion?) being the latest=20
culprit in this genre.
=20
About ten years ago I started to rewrite Twelth Night by keeping exactly the=
=20
plot (twins, etc) but putting every Shakespeare line in a Manhattan lingo.=20
Skakespeare without poetry. I think I did the first few scenes.

I agree with you; Olivier's, Guilguld's and the latest English guys'=20
Shakespeare are awful to me too

[]  well yes, but the context was actually about the potential for real
political action--in which case, one needs to first realize that one needs
organization, unity & concensus--otherwise it is just talking, which is OK,
but one should not parade around in such clothes as "political action."

[]  oh in deed--you might remember that Mr. Weinberger sent the poem pro-jay
newsletter a nice note denouncing my good friend tony dohr after he
supported baraka's attack as thoughtful, well reasoned & accurate in his
report on that event. (also in the pro-jay newsletter)

b) As for Orono conference's purpose to have been "political action." To be=20
blunt about it, since when does a group of full professors, associate=20
professors, assistant professors, etc. (I am assuming, maybe unfairly, that=20
was the constitution of the majority of the attendants) create political=20
momentum. If the conference is so keen about "political action," perhaps its=
=20
participants could do something about the shameful, exploitative institution=
=20
of "adjunct lectureships" (is that the term), which increasingly allows=20
universities to suck the blood of too many of its teachers at ludicrously lo=
w=20
salaries and with very few benefits, a la 19th century industry barons.=20
Instead of chasing after the ever shrinking number of tenured positions, why=
=20
don't those with positions risk their jobs and strike - together- until the=20
institution of "adjunctship" is relinquished by universities. Of course, tha=
t=20
would be risky; but that's what political action means to me.=20

o be sure, I am an outsider. What do I know? It only appears to me that no=20
industry workers would tolerate today the conditions college teachers are=20
tolerating in the States, except for "illegals."  At least, "illegals" know=20
why they have to take this shit (family back home, deportation). In my=20
opinion, college teachers constitute (especially in the humanities) the most=
=20
passive, class unconscious -competing against each other in the worst=20
tradition of scabbing- group of workers imaginable. Because of that I find=20
all this talk about "revolution," "political action," "revolutionary=20
language" (whatever) in these conferences or symposia, etc., a bit rich.

We come back, it seems to me, to the same question we started with in=20
Baraka's altercation with Watten, Weinberger, etc. Does politically radical=20
activity have anything to do with experimental writing? I would say Baraka i=
s=20
fulminating exactly against this blurring of distinction (except, for me, fo=
r=20
the nagging question why he keeps attending these conferences since he must=20
know what he will mostly hear there. Perhaps these confrontations are agit=20
props.)

In my last post I mentioned the "treasure trove" of "The Arcades Project"=20
being, in all sorts of ways, as a central book for the next fifty years. The=
=20
distinctions (dilemma) between radical political action and writing are one=20
of the main themes of the chapter entitled "Literary History, Hugo." Here is=
=20
a quote by Walter Benjamin from that chapter which focuses exactly on what I=
=20
am talking about, on the tenor of my argument:

   "A. Michiels, Histoire des id=C3=A9es litt=C3=A9raires en France au XIX s=
iecle=E2=80=99=20
(Paris, 1863), vol. 2, provides, in his portrait of Saint-Beuve, an=20
outstanding description of the reactionary man of letters at midcentury.

    I caused a revolutionary wind to blow;
    I made the old lexicon don the insurgents=E2=80=99 red cap.    [L.S.!!]
    No more words, Senator! Commoner, no more!
    I raised a storm at the bottom of the inkwell."     (AP, p. 746)




Doug, I am sending this letter also to the List. You are part of the argumen=
t=20
now. I believe you should continue to be so.=20


Ciao.

-


Phenomenology of the Other


Even now, I cannot speak for the Other, said Nikuko. The Other has her
chains around me; they are of my own manufacture, not in the sense of
hand-work, but of factory-labor, theoretical machinery refusing permis-
sion to the nth degree.

The chains are fiery and adamant; I hold my wasted arms within them, un-
daring to touch the heated metal. The Other, by the very fact of her ex-
istence, holds me enthralled, holds me in thrall. I am immobilized. Alan
says, spell that out; Nikuko replies, it is the Other who spells, casts
spells, the caste of the Other whom I do not understand, whom I dare not
comprehend, whom I cannot comprehend.

She will open up gates and filters to me, routers and firewalls to me; she
will throw everything in my direction, to the extent that I am thrown into
existence, into her existence, out of existence. She is writing this - if
I have anything to say, it is that the Other is writing this, that I am an
Other, that she is external, that I am supplicant. Alan says so she writes
you into existence, Nikuko, and Nikuko replies, no, it is not like that,
Alan, I am primordial, pre-existent; when I die, the world dies with me.

But she is writing this, yes, she is writing this, without my permission,
Alan, and she has opened all firewalls and all fields, and I will call
her, will call the Other, Bodhisattva, but not in her regard, not in the
regard of the Other, Alan. Not in the look, Nikuko, Alan replied, not in
the gaze of the Other, Nikuko, and Nikuko replies, I can wait, I can
always wait.

Wa wa wa.

=================

Note: Why Bodhisattva? Who has declared in this manner, and to whom? It is
a disturbing move, as is the "primordial." Is opening an arousal? Is the
Other always already a lure as such? Is the Other always open? What does
it mean, not to recognize firewalls? Surely prisons are stronger than any
thought; in the United States, their privatization turns thought into
mass-substance, and the country into a complex of concentration camps.
Bodhisattvas seem distant, in terms of compassion and spirituality. Nikuko
and Alan, of course, are talking otherwise: Nikuko and Alan are still per-
mitted to talk.

i'm sorry ken, i have to disagree.
 canada is not technically part of
America. it is  tectonically part of a merica. listen, i don't want to
come
off as a canadian nationalist zealot but the notion of "most commonly used
and understood" is a bit naive. used and understood by whom? Americans?
definitely not by anyone whom has been to both places. i get your drift in
a way. my cousins in northern ireland dream about comimg to america --
that being- not europe or australia or africa or icelandbut the
delineations you suggest or believe in are more complicated.

if i were to follow your thinking then poets from belize are appple pie
and baseball  as are alaskans.

my original beef (and that's a small b Beef) was about place or
platform. we, all as writers and thinkers about poetry. the home base is
not
homogonized(sp?).

your home base may be the pentagon you reach after third,  mine the
tree
whre i can call "ally ally infree" if i get there before the kid who is
it. think about regional differences. the APG is not the TRG even though
some lines in the manifestoes rhyme.

this computer won't lat me backspace so i say

just be careful,
kevin hehir

 The Ad and the Ego
=20
 The celebrated film by Harold Boihem and Chris Emmanouilides that takes
 on advertising on its own terms and exposes the destructive power of a
 mass media system out of control.  It shows the link between our
 debased public discourse and a media culture that defines freedom as
 consumer choice rather thandemocratic participation.  This film goes
 beyond deconstructing individual ads to show how living in an
 advertising infused environment affects our perceptions of the world,
 of power and ourselves.  Viewer discretion is advised:  you will never
 look at an ad the same way again.  (57 min.)

Good catch, I suppose I sort of did that on purpose.  But along the =
lines of what Ken and George wrote, I don't think of "American" poetry =
as that written in the "USA", or at least I always refer to this country =
as the "USA" and never "America", probably a note of self-consciousness =
that my Canadian friends, especially Jeff Derksen, impressed in me.  =
Kevin Davies, for those of you who don't know, is "from Vancouver" =
though I think he wasn't born in that city, and has been living in New =
York for as long as I have (originally from New Jersey), so I consider =
him as much part of this "scene" as anyone born in the US, not that New =
York's is the only scene in the US.  Consequently, if I were to record =
for myself all of the best poetry readings that I've seen in New York, a =
good half (or some lopsidedly large percentage) of them would probably =
be by "Canadians" -- Jeff, Kevin, Dan Farrell, Lisa Robertson, Steve =
McCaffery, Peter Culley, Darren Wershler-Henry, Christian Bok, etc. etc. =
(there ARE more, just don't want to bore you) -- and its very tiresome =
for me to see them ignored by anthologies and critical writers who =
dismiss them as not very important to the great American modernist =
tradition.  There is a great "American" modernist tradition of writers =
from the US -- I don't think Louis Dudek, Raymond Souster, Irving =
Layton, Earle Birney, those folks, offer nearly as much -- but if it =
survives as anything, it's going to include Canadians as a substantial =
part of it.  I think Roy Kiyooka is the most interesting poet in the =
Premonitions anthology of "Asian North American Poetry", and what about =
Daphne Marlatt? -- more interesting than tons of writers we are so =
fascinated by now in an effort to keep this tradition alive.

For those interested in copyright issues...
From Library Journal's Academic Newswire (TM)
July 25, 2000

NATIONAL WRITERS UNION TAKES ON CONTENTVILLE.COM
Another day, another copyright controversy. After being
contacted by a member whose articles had appeared for sale
on the content clearinghouse www.contentville.com, National
Writer's Union (NWU) President Jonathan Tasini last week
fired off a warning shot to Contentville founder Steven
Brill.  "The National Writers Union represents more than
6000 writers," wrote Tasini. "Of these, there could
literally be thousands whose work is being used illegally
at your website, not to mention thousands of other [non-
union] writers." Tasini urged Brill to contact him so the
two could work out a solution, most likely involving the
Publishing Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), an NWU initiative
that negotiates, collects, and distributes license fees for
member writers. Tasini has already succesfully sued a group
of publishers, lead by the New York Times, claiming that
the publishers illegally sold freelance articles to digital
archives without obtaining the permission of, or paying the
authors.  The verdict was recently upheld on appeal (see LJ
Academic Newswire 5/18/00) and could be headed to the
Supreme Court.
------------------------
BRILL TO TASINI: WE'RE NOT THE BAD GUYS
It appears, however, that Tasini will not have to head back
to court to sue Contentville. Once contacted, Contentville
founder Steven Brill immediately responded to Tasini's
charges and vowed that he would do the right thing. "We
want to do not only what the law requires," Brill wrote to
Tasini, "but what decent ethics require." Brill has
scheduled a meeting with Tasini to discuss matters further.
In his response to Tasini, Brill also said that
Contentville would consider paying royalties to
contributors. Moreover, Brill said he has tracked all
purchases to date and would pay royalties retroactively to
whomever the copyright owners are determined to be and take
down any article if instructed to do so.  "I'd be pretty
[upset] if I thought I owned something and was watching as
someone else sold it and pocketed the money," writes
Brill.  But  Contentville insists that it did enter into
license agreements with digital archives, including well-
known library suppliers Bell and Howell and EBSCO, for the
content they posted for sale.  "I don't think we should be
cast as the bad guy here for trying to create a market for
this stuff and for getting it started by going to those who
say they own it," says Brill.

------------------------
COPYRIGHT EXPERT: LIBRARIES SHOULD SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF
TASINI IN LICENSE AGREEMENTS
As amenable as Contentville's Brill seems to be in
resolving his current conflict with writers, the flap
raises a number of serious questions about the electronic
licensing of content, especially in light of the Tasini v.
New York Times verdict.  Do these digital archives actually
have the rights to the content they are licensing? How does
one know? And would a library be liable, like Contentville,
for unwittingly distributing material illegally, even if it
thought it had a valid license agreement? According to
Karen Hersey, Intellectual Property Counsel for the
Massachussetts Institute of Technology, while perhaps not
financially liable for infringement, libraries should take
note of the Tasini ruling, as it could dramatically affect
the amount of content supplied via license agreements into
which they have entered. Bell and Howell VP James D.
Barcelona told the LJ Academic Newswire the Tasini ruling
could force large chunks of material to be removed from
their databases (see LJ Academic Newswire 5/18/00),
something libraries should remember when paying license
fees, says Hersey. "Not only should libraries be
negotiating for warranties, and for a right to be
indemnified and held harmless if the materials delivered by
the publisher are infringing the copyright of third
parties, they should also be negotiating a right to recoup
a percentage of their license fees if the archive they have
paid to access the content falls below a certain percentage
[of content promised]," explains Hersey.

New Work by Literature Awardees TAYLOR BRADY and SUSAN GEVIRTZ

San Francisco - New Langton Arts announces the literature awardees of The
Bay Area Award Show 2000, San Francisco poets Taylor Brady and Susan
Gevirtz. Brady and Gevirtz are risk-takers who manipulate language in
innovative, vigorous ways. Brady reads pieces from To Not (1995-), an
ongoing series of sequential poems, which includes excerpts from Research, a
novel-in-progress which reconfigures Brady's autobiography into a critical
reading of Proust. Gevirtz reads two new pieces, Thrall and Deciphretude,
and a selection from her forthcoming book, Hourglass Transcripts.
TAYLOR BRADY recombines raw material from his own written work to create
hybrid compositions with infinite possibilities. Brady, a board member at
Small Press Traffic, SF, has published two chapbooks 33549 (Leroy Books, SF,
forthcoming) and Is Placed/Leaves (Meow Press, Buffalo, NY, 1996), and has
had poems and critical essays published in numerous periodicals including
Mirage #4/Period(ical) and Berkeley Poetry Review (2000).
SUSAN GEVIRTZ' writing is often a fluid response to her context and
interrogates the inherent subjectivity of language. of her poems which use
language as a vehicle to navigate the experience of a site. Gevirtz received
her PhD from UC Santa Cruz and is currently a writing professor in the
Masters Program at University of San Francisco. She has produced numerous
books of poetry including Dwarf of Passage (Burning Deck Press, Providence,
RI, forthcoming), Black Box Cutaway (Kelsey Street Press, Berkeley, CA,
1999), and Taken Place (Reality Street Editions, Cambridge, England, 1993).

The EPC is in fact an invaluable poetry resource, but the Chronicle article
makes it sound as if Robert Creeley's collaborations with Francesco
Clemente, Robert Indiana, and Donald Sultan are documents produced and
delivered by the EPC. They are not. These online collaborations are found at
the 2River web site at Daemen College in Amherst, New York. EPC is simply
pointing to them.

Lyssa Royal and Rush Limbaugh share central Constitutional 4-D values.  As a
UFOlogist and a John Birch Republican, The MAROON grapples with
imponderables.

 I am pleased to announce an article about the Electronic Poetry Center in the
 Information Technology section of the current issue of _The Chronicle of
 Higher
 Education_. The article is now available online if you go to
 http://www.chronicle.com/
 and click on headline, "The Bards of Buffalo".
 I haven't seen the print version yet but I think that it will be slightly more
 expansive, possibly including photos and/or examples of some of the works
 discussed.
 The article quotes a number of people familiar to this list.
 It is great to see digital poetry receive attention from such an important
 source!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chronicle of Higher Education writer, Zoe, did a good job considering
the obstacles she faced (no knowledge of poetry, for one thing). You'll
notice that the article doesn't try to describe or generalize about "this
kind of poetry," so readers who don't know contemporary poetries are going
to feel they are missing some basic definitions. I'm sure Zoe tried to get
a "few inches" of such definitions into the piece, and I'm guessing it got
cut. How hard it is, in such venues, to do the topic justice.

In general I agree with Loss that it's good EPC is getting this kind of
exposure.

        Some very sad and tragic news:

        Philadelpho Menezes died in a car accident Sunday, 23 July 2000.

        He was only 40 and working on the organizing of an upcoming
conference of the Sound Poetry to be held in Sao Paulo, his native city.
He had just issued
a new CD, INTERPOESIA, produced with Wilton Azeredo.

        Philadelpho Menezes produced many works and CDs of Sound Poetry
and Visual
Poetry, organized many conferences in both areas and wrote extensively on
them, critically and theoretically.

        He was also Professor in the post-graduate program in Semiotics
and Communication of the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo.

        His major work, POETICS AND VISUALITY  A Trajectory of
        Contemporary Brazilian Poetry
        is in English translation by Harry Polkinhorn, San Diego State
        University Press, 1995..

        Excerpts from this work are at Light and Dust Mobile Anthology of
        Poetry

        http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm


        Also theoretical work of Philadelpho Menezes in English
        translation is  included in:

        CORROSIVE SIGNS Edited by Cesar Espinosa, trnaslated by Harry
        Polkinhorn. (Washington D. C.:  Maissonneuve Press, 1990).


        Philadelpho Menezes was a very generous and energetic
participant, organizer
and distributor of ideas and works and performances of Sound and Visual
Poetry. His work and spirit and life are an example of the
openness and internationalism in the practise, thinking, history and
generosity possible in the open fields of Visual Poetry and Sound Poetry,
of the Intersign.

        In honor of Philadelpho, may fellow workers keep alive his example
and memory and works.


        He who walks in hiddennes

        has light to guide him

        in all his acts.

                        --Chuang Tzu

        in this spirit, we have the light of Philadelpho Menezes for guide

Friends,
             again the misfortune puts a black rose in the experimental Latin
American poetry. Franklin Valverde, poet from Sao Paulo, warns me for telephone
that our dear
friend, the poet Brazilian Philadelpho Menezes, goes out in an accident of
automobile the day Sunday 23 of July. He had only 40 years old...

            In his last communication informed me of the event that was
preparing in his native city, Sao Paulo, on sound poetry. Also he sent me his
last CD Rom
INTERPOESIA that he had produced next to Wilton Azeredo. His sad destiny didn't
want that he makes his projects and leave us in an impassable void of surprise
and
pain...

Kevin,

I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but what you've written in your first
and second(?) sentence there is exactly what I meant and is well
illustrated by your contention:

"used and understood by whom? Americans?"

I didn't specify this in my first post, but yes that is what I meant (in
the sense that "Americans" to "Americans" (people who live in the USA)
means people who live in the USA.)  The term "Americans" is used by many
people who live in the US (myself including) to define themselves.  What
the use of that term in that way ignores, however, is that if we really
wanted to be accurate we would consider ourselves "North Americans" a term
that would also define Canadians, since (as I said earlier) Canada is a big
ole chunk of North America.  What is it that makes people from Belize not
"American?"  What is it that makes people from Canada, Columbia, Peru,
Panama, Costa Rica (a country I'm familiar with and in which most of the
people I met considered themselves "American"), Mexico, Brazil not
"American?"  I know what you mean when you say "American" and you mean
people that live in the US, but what I'm trying to point out is the
assumptions that are inherent in speaking about place and nationality in
that way.  Yes, tectonically and geographically, all the places I mentioned
are part of  what could be (and should be) considered "America."  But they
aren't by most of the people who live in the US.  Perhaps those people that
have had the opportunity to travel are enlightened enough to see
differently, but is that all it takes -- a little travel -- to undo the
image that is portrayed to residents of the US and is portrayed by
residents of the US, that we are the most important, advanced, and
generally wonderful country in the world?  separate from every other
country in the world?  superior to every country in the world?  especially
country's we may be associated with merely by the accident of proximity?
who share the same geographic descritption that we do (North _America_,
South _America_?)  The hemisphere we live in is composed of continents
called North and South America.  What does it mean that residents of the US
erase all the other countries and people who live in this big, grand place
called North and South America and reduce all that land so that the word
"American" describes only the fifty states?  As poets, one of our tasks is
analyzing and re-configuring the common parlance of our communities.  If we
don't take the time to stop and think about what the word "American" means
as it is commonly used and understood by many residents of the US, then who
is?  Is our use of the word "American" in the sense that you've used it
simply innocuous?  Perhaps.  Though I think that the use of that word in
that sense isn't inocuous.  That is not to say that the misuse of the term
"American" is consciously malicious; instead, I believe it is the
_unconsciousness_ of that use of that word that is the problem.
Questioning the use of "American" to describe what is literally the US is a
political action, as is using the word "America" to describe the USA.  It
is an action that needs to be examined.  I'm not here to say what that
examination should reveal.  Obviously, I have my own opinions about what it
means, but the examination is more important than the result.  When
examined, the use of the word "American" to denote the US is a fascinating
metaphor for the way that US (American) culture has moved beyond the
national boundaries of the US.  As US pop culture spreads out into the
world, the term "American" may really be able to be applied without regard
for other members of North and South America, because everywhere in the
world will be "American."  Then we can refer to wherever we want as
"American" and it'll even be accurate, cuz we'll just be talking about that
which has been homoginized by the sort of thinking that allows someone to
refer to the USA as "America."  Understanding (in our language and our
minds (if there is a division)) that the USA is a small part of a much
larger body does not homoginize the world, but instead allows use to see
that there are people different from us living in more or less the same
space, that we have neighbors, that we are just another country much like
other countries in this big old world.  Thanks.

Kathy, etc.-

Just caught your Bibliofind post.  I wanted to suggest that people try
Advanced Book Exchange (www.abe.com) instead of Bibliofind.

Some--probably not you, Kathy--may ask what I have against Amazon, and I
can only say that I have an irrational fear of conglomerates.  ABE is just
as good as Bibliofind, however, and actually they're larger (20 million as
opposed to 10 million by their Web site claims, which may or may not be
what's important when you're looking for a particular used/rare book).  The
ABE site additionally claims that it's the "world's largest network of
independent booksellers," which I think is also true--6,300 bookstores on
the ABE list, "thousands" by the Bibliofind claim.  For rare poetry titles,
I've found them to have everything Bibliofind has.  ABE also lists the used
bookstore that has the book (just like Bibliofind) and puts you into direct
contact with the bookstore (just like Bibliofind).  It's possible that some
rare/used bookstores, many of whom share my irrational fear of
conglomerates, put books on ABE that they don't put on Bibliofind.  I've
not heard which one gives the better deal for the bookstore, although I
believe ABE listings are free for the bookstore, presumably with a charge
exacted when ABE connects the buyer to the store.

At the same time, I don't want to over-heroize ABE since I don't know much
about them, and I've sure they're backed by the same money and forces
driving Amazon.  But ABE is a Canadian company, still owned and operated by
its founders, and I find myself irrationally trusting Canadians.

Despite the fact that they do list it on the site, I've found that many
people don't realize that Bibliofind is owned by Amazon.  In part, this may
be because they know that Amazon owns and heavily advertises Alibris, and
Alibris is very similar to Bibliofind.  It may seem odd for one company to
own two services doing approximately the same thing and, in fact, it is
odd.  As far as I can tell, Alibris and Bibliofind do exactly the same
thing, or almost the same thing.  Alibris warehouses some books, then
special-orders what it doesn't have from any used bookstore that will give
it to them for cheap, while Bibliofind lists books from specific used
bookstores, then connects the user with the bookstore when a sale is made.
Why does Amazon own both these ventures?  A good question, and one which I
cannot answer except by wild speculations about trying to make the market
appear more varied than it is.

There is yet another option for used/rare book searchers, believe it or
not, and it is perhaps the most elegant.  Although it sometimes isn't very
fast, there is a service called bookfinder.com (www.bookfinder.com), which
returns search results from Alibris, Bibliofind, ABE, Powells.com and many
other used/rare book databases on the Web (currently not www.SPDBooks.org,
however, which has many "new" books that have been on the shelves long
enough to become rare books).  With Bookfinder, you wait a little longer,
but you get a very extensive list back.

Bibliophiles, unite.

        Oh yes--KORA had been in print for some time before the seventies
to be sure, from City Lights--had one of the third printings of it for a
long time, found at yard sale back in 67--

        also SPRING AND ALL  was reprinted by Frontier Press in
1970--basically a bootleg--though it is a very handsome edition--

I am curious...
How do you deal with friends who are bad - and I
do mean a level of prosodic atrocity not to be
believed - poets? One's so much more inept as you
so as to be embarassing - especially when they
are twice your age?
Not ones who write poems in journals and know
they are bad - but who actually call themselves
poets and ruin open readings and waste editors
time and whom you always see sitting in coffee
shops with their notebooks that are always as
strangely absent of words as the last time you
saw them and who show you their poems asking what
do you think and name drop famous dead poets and
you try to be kind and you try to be cruel and
you try to remain silent but nothing seems to
work?
Otherwise - they are usually fine people. That's
why they are my friends.

Caveat emptor:

I went to the bibliofind site and found the book I was looking for at two
locations, and the site's software forced me to fill out a form for both
locations, so I am not sure if I have bought two books or one. I'll see soon
enough. When I wrote back to the site I was reminded that Bibliofind is only
a service for putting buyers and sellers together and that I need to contact
the prospective sellers about my possible purchase.

Hi Tony and George (and friends),

Sorry to omit the only important part of my earlier message. Here's the item
about Frim Fram, Kroll and Nat King Cole:

from JohnnyO There's a good reason that you couldn't decipher that
part...because it's gibberish. In Nat's original version, there's a tip-off
sentence that explains the whole thing. Here first is Diana's version,
followed by Nat's. Each of them, by the way, uses a different gibberish line
in the song, so each has been given the one specific to that performer.
Having said that, I must, in all fairness, give equal time to those who have
a dissenting opinion. Quoting from the liner notes to Mosaic's 18-CD set,
"Some older musicians contend that, while the title made as much sense as
"Shoo Fly Pie," in fact there really was an "Ausen" bakery that served
something called "chefafa" on the side." Personally, I wonder more about
what those "older musicians" had been drinking than what they had been
eating...especially in light of Nat's final line. There was a wealth of
material to choose from for Nat, this being one of his most-recorded songs,
including a V-disc recording and at least 3 live versions that have been
issued on CD alone, ALL of which include the final line that explains the
whole thing. I went with the domestically-released studio version for the
transcript. Anyway, it's a shame to realize that my dream girl has feet of
clay... leaving out the joke without which the song makes no sense. But she
compensates for it with a neat stride intro which sounds a lot like Fats
Waller with a hangover...as opposed to Nat's own intro, which sounds more
like Art Tatum on 'ludes...and I must say it's refreshing to know that this
is the second lyric from Diana/Nat I've been asked to post here... Diana

tama d'nala


a thin wire connects this building to a site a mile and a half away among
demons - and palisades, all of them, to the sheen of jewels curved of no
regard. are thin wires metaphors for what will happen to my head beyond
the curved jewel - beyond these matters, carving stone by stone - clouds
of demons! hosts of them!

completion of horrifying deeds which have come between us, have brought
corpses, now defend yourself - i will hold them from caring! deeds! deeds!
thin wires of dread, finality of stone within stone driven to incomplete
destiny and enlightenment! no such thing! entrance of stone, gating of
stone, here comes one! escaped, noise is information that makes no
difference at all!

her intense and mournful form of stone in stone, i wonder: how many, how
long! if there is one thin wire, there are thousands in these matters, she
dancing naked in a dress. nothing! wa! wa! wa!

listen to the noise and learn about the universe! my head and my brain are
connected by thin wires of no regard in these matters, dancing forlorn and
mournful. our park: prospect park, is the center of the thin-wire universe
- a very small part of the cosmos, connected by thin wires. remember our
former substance. fortifying myself against any form of removal of stones,
one after another, so that one chooses or is chosen, pierced clit, cock,
penetration of consonants, team-spirit.

the sublime is the moment when spirit breaks apart spirit; i defend myself
against the hosts of demons. i have fucked tama. the first and foremost
thin wire connects my house to the park - the longer the wire, the greater
the noise. the whisper of enlightenment - within stone, form strives to
escape. there is no enlightenment, there is no path to the paths of
stakes. thin wires heat up my neighborhood with thunder and lightning,
thousands of thin wires: think of them, each labeled and very long.
traveling, she saw before her a massive thin wire in the stone cliffs.
who would find her glowing.

oh there you go, michael a, drawing me out of lurk with a little review i
composed only for my [cough] friends, dangling...

---------------------

BOTH SIDES NOW
Joe Amato

A Review of
_My Friend, the Poet_
by O. Jam Atoe
Nagaram Press
Salem, Massachusetts
58 pages; paper, $9.95


Propriety dictates that I observe at the outset that O. Jam Atoe, author of
_My Friend, the Poet_, is not only a very good poet, but a very good
friend.  I have wanted to review O. Jam's poetry for a some time now, hence
I am pleased to have finally been given the opportunity to do so.

The 57-poem sequence that comprises _My Friend, the Poet_ interrogates the
fundamental poetic conundrum announced by the book's title:  to what
advantage may a poet presume to write about his (or her) fellow poets, and
their poetry, when such poets are also his (or her) friends?  This theme is
granted its most direct elaboration in the collection's first poem, "Bob's
cousin":

        Bob's cousin
        Sam
        had a way with words.

        Was it Sam
        or his words
        that I liked

        or both?

The apparent simplicity of these lines belies the undercurrent of doubt
that I daresay we must all experience to some degree when in the company of
those whose personalities are as congenial as their "way[s] with words."
Indeed, as I composed this review, I found myself pondering whether O.
Jam's poetry or personality was the more compelling.  Owing to the
well-groomed air of indifference with which he has greeted the various
accolades obtaining from his published work -- and note the persistent
insouciance with which he has propped himself before the public eye -- the
man himself may be said to be something of a work of art.  He manages
somehow to exude the appropriate mannerism at every locution, inserting his
fastidious carriage into the very quality of his conversation.  His is a
delicate intermingling of sangfroid and discretion, the latter particularly
evident when counseling others on possible investment strategies.

And in fact, as one might expect, one of the poems in this collection
addresses with due restraint the self-eliding poise attendant to the
conceptual charge of poet-as-poetry:

        The poet is
        my friend
        what he writes
        writing
        what he is.

And again, here is O. Jam on the contemporary alpha-fiduciary convolutions
of the global marketplace:

        Woods, or words?

        I said we're in the woods
        with words
        especially when friends are involved.

        So take your business elsewhere
        I said.

The poet here is clearly echoing a sentiment long felt (e.g.) among the
last century's entrepreneurial classes:  when it comes right down to it,
best not to make too much of a friend's words (poet or no).  Where money
(or other cultural capital) is at stake, all bets are off, for words on
paper (a wood product) are no more a guarantee of loyalty than are words
"said."  That this necessarily complicates (of course) such assertions
*within* the poem is a paradox regarding which attentive readers will no
doubt derive many hours of contemplative satisfaction.

I was most moved by the following, though, a passionate, perceptive gem
from one who, I would venture, counts me as among his most demanding
poet-friend-critics:

        Be a man about it
        I told her
        keep it to yourself
        and write it down later.

The strength of these lines resides in their assignation of utter
resilience to the character of the addressee, for whom words inevitably
become a calculus of pent-up emotion, tranquilized through sustained
recollection.  (And good advice, at that:  this review was conceived only
after a self-imposed one-week exile from the habiliments of the writing
life.)

The book concludes on a resoundingly reflexive note, troping both on the
latent double of "my friend" (clearly also the poet himself) and the
potential triple of the reader-reviewer, who may very well *be* a
(poet-)friend:

        Get lost, friend.
        I want to be by
        myself.

The ambiguous valence of "by/myself" suggests that the poet is remarking
apostrophically both on the solitude requisite to artistic production and
on the vexed notion of authorship that emerges from the collaborative
imperatives of friendship.  Talk about integrity.  Thus does the volume
augur a refreshingly honest relationship between a writer and his (or her)
readers, whereby what is written is written to be read only by his (or her)
friends, who are (it is to be hoped) poets themselves.

This is a stunning collection, and lives up (like the poet) to the promise
of those various accolades (as above) -- chief among which a National
Endowment for the Arts fellowship -- which O. Jam has garnered since his
graduation five years ago from the esteemed MFA program at Bent U.  A
younger poet who will no doubt be in the running at Yale for many years to

most prized possessions.

Tisa Bryant,

That deviously embedded comment of mine about the "Korean American
takeover of her [Theresa Cha's] identity" was nasty and out of place in a
eulogy for Ursule Molinaro, also of Tanam/McPherson Press lineage.

But what I meant by this was, historically, to the point:  Dictee was
published in 1982 by an experimental NYC press (Tanam) and for the next
ten to 12 years was responded to in writing by an array of writers
interested in its experimental tactics as well as its "Korean uncanny"
force within American/international letters: writers like Michael
Stephens, Susan Wolfe, Stephen Paul Martin, Rob Wilson, all responded to
Cha in diverse ways.But, until 1994, with the publication of
Self/Writing/Nation on Dictee as well as the reprinting of Dictee by Third
Woman Press in Berkeley, the identity-policing scholar Elaine Kim had
ignored this text in her history of Asian American writing, presumably as
not 'realist' or immigrant-narrative enough in Dictee's focus on the multi
lingual and multi-narrative. So this experimental-criticism intertext was
'laundered' out in order to claim the text for Asian American
canonization, which is ok by me as I love and respect Theresa Cha in her
life and works and textual 'afterlife' as well.

Walter Cha of Kaya Press/Anthology innovation was perhaps the first
poet/literary critic and canonizer to recognize the fully experimental as
well as Korean diasporic identity dimensions of Dictee, in her interactive
text DIKTEE of 1992 (indeed, Walter was a big influence on getting Elaine
Kim to consider Dictee as a crucial text).  Walter very generously
supported an essay I wrote on "Falling Into the Korean Uncanny: A reading
of Dictee" in "Korean Culture" journal in 1991, which is notable for the
array of photos of Theresa Cha and her mother and family which her
brother, John Cha, had allowed us to use to frame this essay (one is quite
amazing, with Theresa Cha looking out and virtually interviewing and
documenting the gaze of her readers; the ones with her mother are drenched
in the pathos of a saintly love).

Tisa, I hope this explains but does not excuse my nastiness about her
"appropriation" by the Elaine Kim industry, where white writers are
excluded per se by a priori skin identity (I have seen this done in the
past):  I find this latter attitude wrong politicaly and poetically as
anti-mongrel poetics, though I can understand the will to create an image
of subaltern and abjected Korean Americans as the exclusive one (Cha's
class position, by the way, was by no means that of a boat person....when
she came to US in 1962, and her Catholicism remains crucial to her
trans-identity project of mythic self-remaking as Saint Theresa of the
broken missives).
basta, forgiveness, Rob Wilson

If you are in NYC:

A rally to stop the impending demolition of 85 West Third Street --
the last surviving Manhattan residence of Edgar Allan Poe -- has
been scheduled for Wednesday, August 2, 2000 at 6:00PM.  It will
be held at the corner of Thompson and West Third Streets, one block
south of Washington Square, in New York City. Preservationists and
area politicians will be speaking out against the demolition, and
the rally will be followed by readings from Poe's works.

Please come!  If the house is to be saved, it is critical that
there be a strong turnout for this event. If distance prevents
you from attending, please consider inviting friends or colleagues
who live in the New York City area to attend in your behalf.

Celebrities such as E.L. Doctorow and Woody Allen have already
spoken out in support of the house (New York Times, Op-Ed page,
July 25 and 27), but the presence of PSA members is essential
to the success of this rally.  Please make every effort to attend.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at
(718) 852-5630.

With kind regards,

Michael J. Deas

NEW! CREATIVE WRITING WORKSHOP FALL 2000
AT THE WALT WHITMAN CULTURAL ARTS CENTER
WITH
EDWIN TORRES, a wildly original and talented poet and performer, claimed by
the Nuyorican Cafe, the Poetry Project and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E schools, has been
called nomadic as he travels among these fractions of contemporary poetics.
In a review of FRACTURED HUMOROUS, Brenda Coultas says the reason he is
claimed by all poetic camps is because he is an extraordinary poet.  Indeed
he is, as well as brilliantly funny and distinctive, and yes, a nomadic
writer who has toured England, Germany, Amsterdam and Australia, in addition
to conducting workshops in venues that range from schools and prisons to
farms, festivals, and beaches across the USA.
His publications include FRACTURED HUMOROUS, SANDHOMMENOMADNO, LUNG POETRY,
and I HEAR THINGS PEOPLE HAVEN'T REALLY SAID, in addition to work that has
appeared in numerous anthologies.  His grants and awards include a Grant for
Excellence in Poetry, the Poetry Fund, NYC, The Mentor Fellowship Program,
The Loft, Minneapolis, MN, and the Writers in Residence Program, Sydney,
Australia.

THE CLASS:
BRAINLINGO: Writing the Voice of The Body
As artists we create our own communication.  How we listen "affects" how we
speak, how we see our language "affects" how our voice is heard.  Where the
senses meet each other is where poetry can begin.  This workshop will be an
active creative laboratory that will explore how we communicate by exercising
the languages inside us.  Exercises will be balanced by critiques.  This is
an active writing workshop for poets, performers, and anyone with an open
mind.

THIS IS AN OPEN REGISTRATION, ON A FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVED BASIS.
CLASS SIZE WILL BE LIMITED TO 15 PARTICIPANTS

DATES: Sept. 16, 23, Oct. 7,14,21,28, from 12 to 2 pm.
FEE: $100.00/ $80/members
REGISTRATION DEADLINE: August 30, 2000
GUIDELINES:
1. Send five pages of writing.
2. A cover sheet with e-mail address and/or phone # for notification.
3. An SASE if you would like your work returned.
4. All applicants will be notified by August 30, 2000.

SEND TO:
Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center
Writing Workshop
2nd and Cooper Streets
Camden, NJ 08102

Berlin, 1923 (Baedeker)


Horse Races. Flat-races and steeplechases at Grunewald; flat-races at
Hoppegarten (Ostbahn). Steeplechases at Karlshorst (Niederschlesische
Bahn) and near Strausberg Station (Ostbahn). Trotting Matches at Mar-
iendorf (tramway No. 73) and Ruhleben near Spandau.

Chinese and Japanese Wares and Tea: L. Glenk, Unter den Linden 20;
Gebruder Eppner, Charlotten-Str. 34.

Horse Omnibuses. Special buses leave the principal theaters after the
performance for Wittenberg-Platz. Night Omnibuses: Potsdam Station,
Nollendorf-Platz, Auguste-Viktoria-Platz (Zoological Garden Station,
Kaiser-Allee, Friedenau, Steglitz (from about 11 p.m. until 2 a.m.).
Stettin Station, Friedrich-Strasse Station, Potsdam Station.

Sing-Akademie, eight concerts in winter. Conductor, Prof. Dr. Georg
Schumann.

The Cathedral occupies the site of another cathedral built in 1747-50, the
poverty of whose appearance even Schinkel (1816-17) was unable to remedy,
and of the beginnings of a royal vault ('Campo Santo') dating from the
time of Frederick William IV. (1845-48). The new building was erected in
1894-1905 in the style of the Italian High Renaissance by Julius Rasch-
dorff and his son, Otto Raschdorff, at an expense of 11 1/2 million marks
(575,000 L.). Its dimensions are: length 344 ft., breadth 246 ft., height
to the main cornice 102 ft., to the foot of the lantern 245 ft., and to
the top of the cross on the dome 374 ft. The material is Silesian sand-
stone, with granite for the lower courses of masonry, while the cupolas,
lantern, and roofing are of copper. An excess of plastic ornamentation and
the restless effect produced by the cupola-spires spoil the appearance of
this mighty edifice.

Facing the Lustgarten, adjoining Passage 43, two rooms contain works in
the Romanesque style. Room 44: Enamels from the Lower Rhine; church-plate
from the abbey of St. Dionysius at Enger, in which the Saxon duke Witte-
kind was buried, comprising the earliest pieces of Frankish work and
dating from the time of Charlemagne (pocket-shaped reliquary); Gold
ornaments of the Empress Gisela (d. 1043) discovered at Mayence (1880).

Skating. In the Tiergarten near the Rousseau Island and on the Neuer See;
in Charlottenburg on the Lietzen-See; at Treptow on the Karpfenteich, and
in the Exhibition Park.

Mourning Clothes: Otto Weber, Mohren-Str. 45.

Schauspielhaus, chiefly for classical dramas. 1000 seats.

Cafes. In the centre of the city, Bauer, Unter den Linden 26, corner of
Friedrich-Str.; opposite, Unter den Linden 46, Victoria-Cafe; Josty,

Trains run between Alexander-Platz and Wittenberg-Platz every 5, on other
portions every 10-20 minutes. On Sundays and, during the 'rush hours', on
week-days the trains are extremely crowded.

stuben ('Weisses Meer'; closed on Sundays in summer), Friedrich-Str. 83,
1st floor; Pomona, Mauer-Str. 66-67.

Call for Papers

REMARKING THE TEXT

July 19th and 20th
University of St. Andrews, Scotland

Following the success of the Marking the Text Conference at Trinity College
Cambridge in 1998, this conference aims to facilitate the ongoing
discussion of textual criticism, editing, and the materiality of the text.
The conference will explore the issue of textuality within the broadest
parameters, taking in relationships between writers, publishers, printers,
booksellers, and others and also attending to the text as a physical
object. The conference will not be period-specific in its focus and will
aim to encourage dialogue among specialists from a diverse range of
scholarly fields.

Topics for papers might include (but need not be limited to):

*       margins
*       lacunae
*       typography
*       textual distortion
*       markets
*       technology
*       underground publishing
*       handwriting
*       palimpsest
*       illustration
*       facsimiles
*       independent publishing
*       counterfeiting

Abstracts of about 500 words should be submitted by 31 October 2000 to the
reading committee at:

was his own warmth and charm for the passing and collecting people

I looking for poetic theory articles for the next issue of the e-zine moria
(www.moriapoetry.com).  Anything dealing with "experimental" poetry is
welcome.  In the past articles have dealt with writers such as Watten,
Bernstein, Derrida, Lacan, Silliman and Jabes;  however, I am not looking
for articles on specific writers.  There are no length requirements or
format requirements.

I am open to articles in English, Spanish or Italian.

        I beg to differ--

        I think it is most appropriate that the last surviving Manhattan
residence of Edgar Allan Poe, author of "The Fall of the House of Usher"
and a writer in love with ruins, graveyards, tombs, crypts which could not
hold the dead fast-- be demolished.

        The event could be made into a wide variety of performance pieces
in the poet's honor, in recognition of his work's making of destruction,
death, decay, despair and detection the stuff of whole vast wings of
libraries:  the short story, the detective story, hoaxed sci-fi
accounts--among others.  Poe lives in libraries, art collections, films,
even an NFL football team, in hundreds of languages the world over-- and
in
the imagination,
not in one among the many many places that in his transit he transiently
occupied.
         The man had no real "Home"--no "dwelling"--he hated the city of
his birth, Boston.

        ("Terror is not of Germany, but of the soul")

        There is already the honor of the NFL team and of the tomb in
Baltimore--the city where Poe's brother died, providing in his delirious
sea voyage narratives the materials for THE NARRATIVE OF ARTHUR GORDON
PYM as Poe looked on, as later he watched his wife die . . . The tomb in
Baltimore was graced on its inaugeration by the presense of two great
poets:  Whitman and Mallarme.


        And Poe died in Baltimore--death and poetry are intertwined for
Poe--

        Therefore saving a temporary place in NYC seems against the Poe
spirit--

        Rather, it should become an occaision for the recognition of its
ruin--with any number of creative tributes to be worked out by making use
of
the event--the entombments among the ruins of many figures made to
resemble Poe's dying characters--to the hieroglyphic scripts made in
jumbled rock in PYM--to bloody heads emerging from rubble crevices--to
small receptacles in which to wall in occultic black cat figures--or the
walling in among small casks of Amontillado, using and joining together
loose rubble, of a distinguished, disappeared personage--to voices issuing
from beyond the tomb--to the letting loose of "the great balloon hoax"--to
"messages in a bottle" floating in oil slicked puddles--among the
gargantuan heaps of smashed brick, splintered wood, broken glass--to large
scarabs planted gleaming in the sun--among treasure maps--and the nearby
trees containing mock mantel pieces over which large stuffed ravens croak
via audo tape--and the purloined letter, poised on a ledge--

        celebrities being celebrities, begin to believe any place or cause
they hang their hat upon to be their home--

        in this case, to honor of the homeless wanderer Poe, youngest
child
of itinerent actors--it would seem more fitting to find a way to make the
performance pieces provided and that of the destruction of the "last
surviving Manhattan residence" of E. A. Poe be a means to be the first
surviving residence of the homeless--and some means towards support of
actors--

        it's easy enough for the celebrities to lend a name--but how
about investing in a home . . . for the homeless--or wandering minstrel--

        it might be a poetic justice for the poet without a home, who
couldn't even conceive of death as a place of eternal rest--

Maybe you should reconsider your desire to be friends with people that you
can feel superior to?  For me a friendship requires a certain level of
mutual respect. Most of my friends are not poets but for me to be a friend
of a poet I would have to respect his or her work.  I can't be great
friends with people in my academic field whose work I don't respect
either, since this would be an inherent conflict of interest.  Friendship
requires a certain complicity also--the ability to laugh at the same
things, including bad poetry. If you know a poet, you usually like their
poetry and their personality for similar reasons, so you might consider
why this isn't working for you. A friend of mine who isn't a great poet,
but I like his poetry because it reminds me of him.  But it isn't as bad
as to make me want to shoot him.  Perhaps you should move to a different
city in order to meet a better class of poet.

But enough facetious, unsolicited advice...

But Could I Make A Living From It
Jeff Derkson
hole chapbooks
Calgary/Philadephia/Vancouver
unpaginated
ISBN 0-9687436-4-1

Reviewed by Lori Emerson

About “But Could I Make A Living From It”, Jeff Derkson’s most recent book
since the publication of Dwell in 1994: quiet, undemonstrative, funny lines
that can be situated in either a politicized world level with language (some
Wittgensteinian/Marxist-inspired mix  in “I’m three years younger than the
term Third World”); or in an engagement with ‘maleness’ (“So-called
maleness, so-called critical investigation”); or in an examination of human
sexuality as it is inevitably inflected by and enmeshed in (no surprise
here) the dominant discourses of the day (“Investment banking as a sexual
term”); or in the strange American Psycho-esque replication of mid-80’s
obsessive fashion-conscious self-checking (“‘A colleague of mine insists the
color of a man’s watchband should match that of his belt and shoes: Who is
correct?’”).  Derkson’s own lines describe this mixing of discourses best:

“A phrase or utterance stripped of its context as a timeless device?

A slough of pop culture with its eternal returns.”

There is also a permutational quality at work here in Derkson’s scan, from a
number of different discursive viewpoints, of the shape and contour of our
powers to word the world in the face of globalization (“The sun reflects off
the triangular glass tower downtown and into my bedroom--I sprawl on this
corporate light” “This ‘transaction’ translates me until I become my own
ethnographic smear” “It’s not that the content is mine, but that it has been
make generic”).  But these tranformations, folding into and out of each
other, also ‘scan’ centipetally and centrifugally what it means to write, to
be a writer given what we now hold to be true--that language is everywhere
already present and that ‘all the world’s a text’

“Do you put apostrophes on yourself--I’m in quotes.”

“Waiting for the train, I’m thinking of you in italics, where the text meets
the latex.”

This leads into what’s most intriguing, no it should be ‘attractive,’ about
his work, and which makes it very much not the usual interrogation of
meaning, referentiality, authenticity: the way in which it brought me to
think of the possibility that the de-humanization that the text opposes, a
corporatizing flattening of the world, is something that such postmodern
questionings (of meaning, referentiality, authenticity, truth, centre etc.)
could work alongside very well--if not support or perpetuate in some way.  I
mean that, and here I’m trying to think like the philosopher Stanley Cavell,
the grasping which is at the root of globalization is also at the root of an
(western) intellect gone wild-- “Am I a priori to you or am I a priori to
me?”--an intellect that begins to sound mad in its grasping search for
certainty, and of course subsequent disappointment in the face of never
being able to ‘know’ in any final sense.  This is what “But Could I Make A
Living From It” most powerfully enacts, the effect of which is, I think, one
of animation--or re-animation in the face of a capitalist mentality; by
capitalist mentality I mean those tones of transcendentalism buried deep in
a thinking which, in its abundance, is becoming hard to muster the energy to
comment on anymore, but which, nonetheless, in its reach upward and outward,
continues to annihilate (literally and figuratively) the ground beneath our
feet.  Although “But Could I Make A Living From It” is far from being a
deliberately ‘healing’ text, and far from claiming to be so, Derkson’s lines
illuminate this condition and so begin the task of showing us the way back,
and so begin to bring us back to life.

it's walter lew, not walter cha.  walter's own Excerpts from Dikte for
Dictee was to be included in the Kim anthology of essays, but was excluded
cuz it was too "experimental" and didnt fit the discourse of the anthology.
however, it is one of the most gorgeous books there is.  i hope chax brings
it back out into print.

I have to disagree strongly here. I don't think you are always a friend of
the *poet*, sometimes more of a friend of the *person*. I do have friends
whose poetry I don't like or respect, and either we avoid that topic, or in
at least a couple of cases (and this is much better), we simply disagree on
that topic, and some good discussions have come of it. In fact, I think the
utmost respect for a poet's work doesn't guarantee that I want that poet as
a friend =97 friendship is something based on more than that, and can be a
good deal more complicated. That said, I admit that I count, among my very
best friends, poets whose work I love and respect.=20

Ah, but maybe they are superior in so many other ways.

Love to all.

How embarrassing, I spelt Jeff Derksen's name wrong--please forgive my gaff
and please change from 'Derksen' to 'Derksen.'

Wow!  Poetry and academic tsk tsk as litmus tests for friendship!  That's a
new one.  "You've been generous with me, my wife, my kids--always there when
I need you--but I don't like your poetry.  Bye."  Hey!  What happens when
only every other poem appeals to us?  Stay.  Go.  Stay.  Go.   Charles said
it better, but I said it funnier.  Best, Bill

Some visual art by Basil King is now up at Avec's
website:www.poetrypress.com/avec. It can be found at the bottom of the
homepage.

Avec Books is seeking a zip drive and a 56k modem for the Mac. Used
