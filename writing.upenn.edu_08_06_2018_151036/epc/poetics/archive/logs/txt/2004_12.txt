I have just finished the second of two long poems-15 or so pages each-that
go together as a kind of diptych, "Poem for my Husband" and "Poem for my
Wife." (The speakers of the poems, however, are not, at least in my
imagination, married to each other.) "Poem for my Wife" has been published
in Bellowing Ark. My question is this: I would like to see these poems read
by actors; each is a kind of monologue, and so I am wondering if there's
anyone on the list in the New York area who either knows people who might be
interested in doing such a thing or who might themselves be interested. Oh,
I should be clear, I am not talking about actually producing the poems as a
theater piece-at least not yet; I have no idea if they would work that way.
But I would like to see what someone who is an actor does with these two
characters I have created.

Thanks,

Rich Newman

Freedom's just another word for some place to abuse.

I can't stand it at this point. This is rant. I'm sick and tired of
debates. I'm sick and tired of hair-splitting. I find myself hating the
word 'Christian' and everything it stands for. We Jews should have killed
ourselves off; instead, we channeled virulent monotheisms of all stripes,
holocausts without number. We let others do it and do it to us. We do it
to ourselves and others. I hate the word 'pro-life' and everything it
stands for - while children around the world are starving and it's going
to get worse. I'm tired of reasoning against the monolith. Most of all I
hate the word 'freedom' which is a dirty word for everything we want to do
around the world. 'Freedom fries'? You bet - it exposes our intolerance of
anyone daring to disagree with us.

I've been using the word 'fascism' recently; I've always avoided it the
past. I see our situation similar to Karl Kraus' - including the weakening
of the dollar, new levels of mass communication and discourse networks,
silent organizations of disparate groups like the Freikorps into a
right-wing mass. Don't take it seriously! Satire works wonders. I find
Bush a blunt ideologue, one whose violence will ultimately take the world
down. If not Bush, someone else, but the guise is the same, and as mass
communications and populations increase, others equally or far more
violent will come along. Fundamentalisms of all sorts can only take over
in a world of such leaky information flow that the poor are sent to the
Pale, unrepresented, polluted. If I were Pale-poor I would join my masters
to fight their masters. O the righteous fight.

Simulacra return with a vengeance in the face of weapons of mass
destruction - and you know what? These weapons smash ontology in the face.
No longer the world of everyday things - but the world of silent,
invisible, and absent killers, hidden regimes of information, nuclear and
other radiations, invisible viral plagues - all plasma, seepage - what
I've been on about for years. Give me a medal.

I can't master my hatred. I turn it against myself. It's so good for you.
I'm harmless. I'll eat my own flesh. But let me ask you: If you could kill
a world leader - without repercussion - anyone you found criminal or
ultra-violent, a Bin Laden or Hussein - if you could do this without any
recrimination, as if by magic, would you? Would you pray for the death of
a criminal if you believed in prayer?

If a criminal and a leader were one and they were prayed to death, I sure
wouldn't want to make an example of them because then we'd have another
Christ to contend with. One, two, a million, Christs, Meshiachs, Messiahs,
Holinesses, grave-diggers, grave-robbers, undead all. Deliverance of
kindness ends up at the wrong end of a gun.

The Christ of the sermon-mount has all but disappeared. Whatever happened
to liberation theology? Marx and decon are now dirty words and sooner or
later someone will bring up Jew Derrida, Jew Levi-Strauss, all those
intellectuals, and the problems they made for Jew-Marx, Lyotard,
Heidegger, all those others. Return of the killers, killers back at you.
We're there waiting for them. We'll contribute with the book, one, two, a
million books. We'll theorize them to hell and back. We'll show them.
We'll show them pictures.

We'll talk that forbidden subject, biology. We'll ignore the hatreds,
poisons, in our systems, our genetic cess-pools, our desire repeatedly to
bring the world down around us for a filthy grasp at heaven. We'll stab
science in the back as intelligence creationism and arguments about
life-tissue send the world environment teetering towards extinction of
pretty much everything around us. Not much time till armageddon (without
capital), slow and dirty.

You can't argue with biology, man. You can't argue with biology, baby.

Who twists our necks?
We twist our necks.
Who twists our necks?
We twist our necks.

Freedom's just another word for someone to abuse.

Don't forget to add  democracy into your words to hate category. Fix an
election and you can abuse your people like we do. Cramming democracy down
the throats of the world--Become a democracy or die---Sounds a little like
the Spanish inquisition.
I applaud what's going on in the Ukraine.

Hawk's Blood visits Brookdale for lecture on American Indian issues=20

KAREN E. BOWES Santos Hawk's Blood sells American Indian crafts to =
Marissa Karlovits, of Holmdel, as Juliana Monroy, Marlboro, looks on.=20
=20
MIDDLETOWN - The "American holocaust" has been overlooked for too long.=20
=20
"Twenty-six million people do not disappear into thin air."=20
=20
That was the message Santos Hawk's Blood, a Chiricahua Apache American =
Indian, brought with him to Brookdale Community College last week.=20
=20
"In Germany, they know more about the American Indian holocaust then we =
do. And here, we know more about the Jewish holocaust," said Hawk's =
Blood during the Nov. 23 lecture.=20
=20
American Indians, once the sole inhabitants of present day United =
States, now comprise less than 1 percent of the total population. =
However, with only 50,000 full-blooded Indians left in America, the =
ratio of teenage suicide and infant mortality are the highest in the =
country, according to Hawk's Blood.=20
=20
"People are still dying on the reservation," said Hawk's Blood. "My son, =
he's 22, tried to take his own life several times. He was diagnosed with =
schizophrenia. He's too smart for his own good, has too much of a =
brain."=20
=20
Hawk's Blood, a former Atlantic Highlands resident, is currently living =
in Pipe Creek, Texas, where he's worked as an actor is such films as =
"Autumn in New York." He is a founding member of the American Indian =
Movement, (AIM) an activist group that fights for Native American civil =
rights.=20
=20
"We hear all about the Jewish holocaust and black slavery," said Hawk's =
Blood. "Why are they ignoring something that happened here? You can't be =
more of a minority if your numbers are less than 1 percent. We're a =
dying race, it's safe to say."=20
=20
Hawk's Blood gave examples throughout America's history of the =
systematic murders that eventually decimated the American Indian =
population.=20
=20
"[Lord Jeffrey] Amherst discovered that American Indians didn't do too =
well with smallpox and the measles. He would have them contaminate a =
blanket and send it into the villages," said Hawk's Blood. "And they =
named a college after him."=20
=20
According to Hawk's Blood, in 1973, American Indians were the =
fastest-growing population in the country. Around this time, the federal =
government began to require that all American Indians receive a vaccine =
to ward against common illnesses such as the flu. It was later =
discovered that the vaccine was actually a sterilization drug and that =
many women were unwillingly sterilized as a result.=20
=20
From 1972 to 1976, the estimate of total sterilizations was around 3,000 =
per year for four years, according to a report by Charles R. England, =
available on the Internet.=20
=20
Hawk's Blood also used the opportunity to clear up common misconceptions =
about American Indians.=20
=20
"Casinos do not represent reality," Hawk's Blood said. "The poorest =
place in America is on the reservation. Yes, the Pequots [American =
Indian people of eastern Connecticut] have done well, but most native =
people still don't have much."=20
=20
As for religion, the population is split down the middle, with most =
American Indians choosing to practice Christianity and a small percent =
still acting as traditionalists.=20
=20
"I'm sure Christ didn't say, 'Go to America and kill Indians,' " Hawk's =
Blood said.=20
=20
Although a critic of the practices of the American government against =
his people, Hawk's Blood considers himself a patriot, having served in =
the Vietnam War and with plans to travel to Iraq in the near future.=20
=20
"We love our country," said Hawk's Blood. "We love our people - it has =
nothing to do with the government."=20
=20
Still, it's not always easy being an American Indian in the Southwest.=20
=20
"No one else has to carry a card that shows the percent of blood [in =
them], why should we?" he asked. "Anything under an eighth disqualifies =
you from any benefits from the U.S. government. And the benefits are a =
joke."=20
=20
Hawk's Blood ended his seminar by singing a traditional song while =
playing a drum his grandfather made in the early 1900s.=20
=20
"There are only 50,000 full-bloods left in the United States, and I'm =
one of them. I'm proud of it," said Hawk's Blood.=20
=20

Sat. December 4, at 5 PM.
45 Carleton St., room 111,
Cambridge, MA

David and Peter will present a collaborative reading & talk: "Art and Poetry
in a Time of Terror"

*  *  *

David Shapiro was a violinist in his youth. At fifteen he met Frank O'Hara,
corresponded with John Ashbery, and was collaborating with Kenneth Koch and
many painters of the so-called New York School. David is a tenured art
historian at William Paterson University, and has been teaching poetry to
architects at Cooper Union for the past twenty years. He has written over
twenty volumes of poetry and prose, including the first book on Ashbery, the
first book on Jim Dine's painting, the first book on Johns' drawings, and
the first study of Mondrian's much tabooed flower studies. He edited An
Anthology of New York Poets, as well as a book on aesthetics: Uncontrollable
Beauty. His most recent books of poetry include A Burning Interior, After a
Lost Original, and House (Blown Apart).

Peter Gizzi's poetry collections include Artificial Heart (Burning Deck,
1998) and Some Values of Landscape and Weather (Wesleyan, 2003). In fall of
2004 Salt Publishing in England will reprint his first book along with 60
pages of early and uncollected work as Periplum and other poems (1987-1992).
He is also the editor of The House that Jack Built: The Collected Lectures
of Jack Spicer (Wesleyan, 1998).

Because several people wrote interchangeably about NEA fellowships
and MacArthur fellowships (which for all intents and purposes IS a
lottery that youcan't buy a ticket for), I'M not so sure that "we
know all this", but, again, maybe that's just me.

What could possibly make you think this might be so?

I'm not naive about how politics and cronyism work on grant panels
but I've seen these tactics used to support "innovative" work as
often as I've seen them used to disallow "innovative" work. I guess
it's possible that some panelists who are supportive of "innovative"
work wouldn't also try to game the system, but that seems like a lost
opportunity rather than corruption that must be decried.

Uh, I didn't write that "the NEA has never rewarded innovation in
arts". I wrote that "the NEA has NEVER made "innovation" in the arts
a major priority for support, either for organizations or
individuals." Many NEA grants have been made to makers, producers and
presenters of "innovative" arts in many different genres over the
years. But the guidelines for applications used by panels for
considering grants have never (or at least very very rarely) included
innovation as a criteria; the NEA has been consistent in supporting
things that can be positioned as possessing both "excellence" and
"stability." This goes back to how the agency was sold to Congress
and has continued in nearly all of the arguments for sustaining the
Endowment ever since.

When the fellowships to Finley, Fleck, Hughes & Miller were made in
1990 it was in a theater program for which the majority of grants
were made to playwrights who wrote pretty standard plays. There was
never an NEA program that gave fellowships in "performance art" as
such. Any artists who might be considered to be "performance artists"
who received fellowships from the NEA applied in programs that
supported theater, dance, visual arts, or music. & all of these
fellowship programs supported FAR MORE artists working in the
traditional modes of these genres than they did artists who were
somehow "breaking new ground."

>The Nobel, we know, is as mired in politics as is our Federal agency, perhaps
>moreso.  Yet they manage to reward the innovative more often, even in the

You've either got a low threshold of what counts as "innovative" or a
very selective list of Nobel laureates in literature. When I look at
the winners of the Nobel Prize for literature for the last hundred
years, "innovation" is not exactly the first word that comes to mind.
But yeah, something like 5-10% IS literally more often than 1-5%.

Subject:      Slought Foundation's Cross Burnings
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

from Slought Foundation's website:

Description: Slought Foundation, a non-profit organization rethinking
contemporary art, is currently organizing an intimate cross burning on
December 3, 2004 from 6-7pm, in accordance with a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling affirming a First Amendment right to cross burnings on private
property (see attached PDF for the 2002 Term Opinion in Virginia Vs. Black).
The burning will utilize twelve miniature crosses featured in the
exhibition, and these crosses will be subsequently returned to the
exhibition after the burning. The location of the burning has not been
disclosed at this time.

This event seeks to demystify the idea of burning a cross and the fear so
often associated with it, and to suggest that as a form of protected free
speech its symbolic meaning is not exclusive to the Ku Klux Klan, and can be
appropriated in turn by others. The proceedings will be documented in video
format (which will be subsequently displayed in our storefront monitor), and
have been organized in conjunction with "Non-Retinal," an exhibition of
"Kovert Konflagration Kovenant," new work by blind African-American sculptor
David Stephens, from November 13, 2004-January 31, 2005 at Slought
Foundation. More information on the exhibition is available here:
http://slought.org/content/11233/

In David Stephen's varied and distinguished arts career in Philadelphia he
has worked as a teacher, dealer, and administrator (with the Pennsylvania
Council on the Arts). He has served on the board of the Fabric Workshop,
Nexus, the Woodturning Center, the Brandywine Workshop and other local arts
institutions, as well as advised and nurtured many community art programs
including those at Taller Puertorriqueno, the Painted Bride, and the West
Philadelphia Cultural Alliance. An artist and sculptor, Stephens has
recently had a solo show at the Philadelphia Airport of work created during
a residency at the Fabric Workshop. In 1999 his graphic work was shown at
The Moore College of Art, and in 2003 he exhibited his work, entitled "144
Crosses for the 144,000," at The Noyes Museum, the fourth in a series of
installations generated by his interest in the work of visionary artist
James Hampton. Now blind due to the early-onset of glaucoma, Stephens often
incorporates Braille into his work, creating objects of interpretation,
discursivity, and touch. The cross, which Stephens considers to be
"emblematic of the process of transformation," frequently appears in his
work as well; he finds it fascinating that the cross was used as a Roman
form of torture but was later adopted by Christianity as a symbol of
redemption.

When I finally stopped complaining about what I called rap crap and listened
to the best of a new generation of word & music, the hip hop fusion genre of
old & new, I discovered the artists listed below are very good. My son (part
of
Jesus Perron & Lyfewyze = Something Eutopian) also insisted I add some his
favorites. Afficianados please forgive my spelling. Favorite fusion elements
are
jazz, reggae and rock. Hip hop is often too lyrically dense for me and in
that respect I prefer avant garde and and jazz readings like Vernon's or
Steve's.
Maybe I'm just too old and can't focus much anymore. Word spoken or read is
often too intellectual, contemplative so word with music provides a visceral
element I need for relief. The dedication and authenticity of many hip hop
artists is just as serious for them as it is for beat type poets. Word up.

..|  Thanks for this Derek. Interesting, good, bad??
..|  If it leads to publishing opportunities or not, it's
..|  great to have poetry rerecognized


Yes, I will soon be starting a Professional Association of Poets to
alleviate this new demand -- it will be a specialist trade union
dedicated to advancing professional development opportunities for all
poets. Of course there will be several levels of professional membership
and even membership associations available (includes annual union/member
due to support our distribution and publicity networks, facilitate
creation of new poetry merchandise, and to promote corporate
sponsorships).

after all the business of poetry is business

Poetry is now so popular that British universities face a
supply-and-demand dilemma. So many students want to sign up for poetry
classes that there are not enough professional poets to teach them.

New writings on PRIME (Peace Research Institute in the Middle East). These
are descriptions of peace-building projects undertaken by Palestinians and
Israelis working together. PRIME is run by a Palestinian, Sami Adwan, and an
Israeli, Dan Bar-On.

*************************

"Learning Each Other's Historical Narrative" in Israeli and Palestinian
Schools
A Joint Palestinian and Israeli Curriculum Development Project
January, 2002 - December 2007
http://vispo.com/PRIME/leohn.htm

"This project of the Peace Research Institute in the Middle East (PRIME)
focuses on teachers and schools as the critical force over the long term for
changing deeply entrenched and increasingly polarized attitudes on both
sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The goal of the project is to
"disarm" the teaching of Middle East history in Israeli and Palestinian
classrooms.

Specifically, teams of Palestinian and Israeli teachers and historians will
develop parallel historical narratives of the Israeli and Palestinian
communities, translate them into Hebrew and Arabic, and test their use
together in both Palestinian and Israeli classrooms. Unlike other projects
that are limited to revising existing Israeli and Palestinian texts, the
PRIME project aims at engaging teachers on both sides in an entirely new
collaborative process for teaching the history of the region.

At this stage in their polarized history there is not enough common ground
for Israelis and Palestinians to create a single historical narrative.
Rather, the project is designed to expose students in each community to the
other's narrative of the same set of events. For the first time, students in
each school system (beginning with 15 and 16 year olds) will not only learn
what shapes their own community's understanding of historical events, but be
required to confront the historical perspectives and contexts that shape the
other community's sense of reality."

*************************

Establishing a "Localized" Process for A Truth and Reconciliation Commission
In Israel and Palestine To Address Refugee Issues at the Heart of the
Conflict
http://vispo.com/PRIME/truthandreconciliation.htm

"....For this reason, the Peace Research Institute in the Middle East
(PRIME) has developed a new "localized" methodology for approaching
Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation. The methodology focuses on recording
oral histories to document Palestinian refugees who fled, or were forced out
of specific locations within Israel and Jewish-Israeli immigrants who
settled in those same locations, many of them after fleeing the Holocaust or
persecution in Arab lands. It also involves recording local
Palestinian-Israeli encounters that bring together a small number of such
families-up to three generations each-over several days."

I'd add MC Solaar, who raps in three languages--his African tribal language, Berber and French--but is unknown here because he doesn't rap in English.  also two local groups whose presence may seem larger to me because they are local:  Blue Scholars and Silent Lambs Project.

it's just plain ignorant to say that hip-hop does not continue to be serious, even if the groups out there don't cast quite the shadows of their predecessors.  that's called the anxiety of influence and the anxiety is something the reader/listener feels as well as the performer.  to judge hip-hop by what is top forty, which is where you might get the ideas it's just gangstas is about as fair as judging poetry by what gets into Poetry.  and no NEA under the thumb of Bush is going to fund the efforts of hip-hop musicians, regardless how independent their expression is.  the only option is self-sustaining and/or having a day job.  perhaps this makes them more authentic, I don't know.

Maybe I'm just too old and can't focus much anymore. Word spoken or read is
often too intellectual, contemplative so word with music provides a visceral

The Ukraine !  Those who are buying into he crap of Western democracy are
fooling themselves. It is a split probably engineered by those wanting to
divide that area and weaken it -its likely the CIA etc are behind it. The
Soviet Union has been deliberately destroyed both by those inside who got
paid off and by those wanting to invest into the place.  Nothing good ever
comes of "freedom" as Alan points out in his (rather too depressed "rant" )
the word is used to mislead and divert people : Bush uses it constantly
while bombs crash down on whatever country (almost always a country with
resources needed or near to another country that has big oil or other
products wanted by capitalism) - Alan's "rant" has some points but is that
Alan talking or Alan's "project"  or is he just having a bad day - I think
that people don't equate Marx with his being Jewish very much - of course
its one way the right can go and other philosophers may have been Jewish etc
Marxism isn't a dirty work nor is deconstructionism both are interesting and
useful ideational systems - against this pessimism theer are many people
working for  - shall we say "the greater good" and there are also people
literally fighting. The holocaust has happened I see to the American Indian
people - thinking people are aware of these things - we have a chance to
prevent the ongoing holocaust of Western Imperialism - it worries me that
the Indian guy is a patriot - sounds as if the Indians ( or he is) saying  -
"look,  this great country has all but exterminated us(me) but we love
hem"  - in fact it sounds like the words of coward  - and of course its thus
a plaint but nothing happens because they don't want to criticise the
Government of the country in which they were the first inhabitants - but
that character is maybe not representative - some Maori are like that here -
others are very strong and politically aware - the best know that the Govt
is no good that its not very good "loving NZ" - by nurturing the culture etc
Maori in NZ are experiencing a revival here but there are of course big
problems and issues but no way were they wiped out - it came close of
course - disease was a problem as many were not resilient to  European
disease and there were those who would want Maori exterminated  - eg in
areas such as the NZ "heartland "  such as the Waikato and so on - but there
are strong movements by Maori and others to counteract that.

But it is true that the general situation (Iraq, he Indians, Israel, Africa,
Chechnya, even the lot of the working class in the so-called "free"
countries - etc etc) is not good - but where there is life there is hope.
Alan's tone -ironic or not - shows he hurts  - but it seems a bit too
dark...

Subject:      on Ange Mlinko's "fact" about Ron Silliman
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Recently on the new blog "minor american" (which is
conducted by the blog duo Magdalena Zurawski and
Ange Mlinko), the following came up from Mlinko:

"That the rumor that Ron Silliman said (way back when)
that women stopped producing good writing when they had
children, is true. He said it to her [Hejinian]. Telling me this,
I think, was a way of impressing on me the underlying bond
that exists between the women of that generation of writers."

It's somewhat clear that it was Hejinian who told this "fact" to
Mlinko, and that of course we're led to believe that Silliman
had said this to Hejinian.

The statement, "is true," in this whisper-down-the-lane "fact"
is not qualified in any way.
I mean, HOW is it true?
Just SAYING that it "is true" doesn't mean much.

And if he did say it, how was it said?
Was it an observation he made on the spur of the moment?
Was he quoting Camille Paglia?
And by the way, does he believe this now?

Let's stick with the question, Does he believe this now?
And let's be perfectly fucking clear here, because anyone
who has been paying attention to Silliman, knows
damn well that he supports women writers.  In fact, he
has had nothing but high praise for Alice Notley, and we
all know she has had two children, and has gone onto
write some pretty mind blowing poems afterward.  He has
been supportive of plenty of other women poets, as well
as many younger women poets, Ange Mlinko among them,
by the way.

But let's suppose he DID make this comment.
HOW long ago was it?  And, is he NOT allowed to
change his mind?

What really is the goal here anyway?  Is change for the
better really the goal?  If it is, then why all this secondhand
information in order to build a wall around a man who quite
obviously does not believe this NOW, whether or not he
ever did in the first place?  Shouldn't the goal be to include
everyone?  Especially those who might have reformed
their previous ideas of the world?

Make room at the table please,
CAConrad

Hats off to this.

This subject has sore corners on every side.

You won't find a Democrat in DC who will dare
speak out against this very well-aimed attack
at free speech.  But then again, that's no surprise,
since it's very difficult to find anyone in DC who
did NOT vote for the Patriot Act.

Not long ago I was talking with a coworker about
making cross burning illegal, and she said "Good!"
And when I made it clear that I thought it was a
bad idea, she dropped her jaw and asked me why
on earth I would support cross burning.  It's not that
I support cross burning, but the right to do it.  If we
cannot see how this Right Wing government is using
this as a way of shutting up many other mouths with
such a law, then we will be famished one day very
soon to speak out when we no longer can.

As much I despise them doing it, I can't help think
how brilliant an idea it is, and how easy in this
politically correct environment, where most people
would be afraid of speaking out for the Klan.  Who
ever thought the ACLU would be representing the
Klan of all groups?  But I'm glad the ACLU is there.

On another ACLU note, not even their lawyers were
able to do anything for gay and lesbian workers of
Cracker Barrel restaurants who were fired when a new
company policy banning homosexuals in the workplace
was passed some years ago.  To this day, it is still
legal to fire someone for being queer in many states.
Many folks don't believe me when I tell them, but go
ahead and look it up yourself.

The freedom to fuck and talk and smoke and who knows
what else is quickly slipping away.

CAConrad
p.s. But I still believe Kerry and Edwards are working
at the recount, and may very well discover that they
are indeed the winners.  And if so, we may have a shot
at something new.  Maybe Kerry can remove the fucking
Patriot Act that HE voted for!

read for us here at Larry's poetry Forum
on Monday, & I recommend seeing him read
if possible, while he's in the states. His use of sound
and sense of the political make the show. Nice tip of the hat
to Schwitters on the sound material.

Not sure if he is using film at all, for the Friday reading
but his presentation background for the Three little Heretics section
he did here w/ Keith Tuma, who read, & Bill Howe, who was absent,
really emphasized our city in a surreal collegiate super-size me way
without the urban element.  Go Bucs.

Be well

we all say things we dont mean or that we haven't ever said

- I disagreed on some political points of view with r silliman but  i hope
that doesnt translate into now disapproving of his poetry etc (or me or he
thinking one of us is :" dishonourable " ) (we have to live in world of very
diverse views (seems so obvious when I say that..)) after all sometimes what
a person may say at one moment doesn't reflect their view at another and so

From the beginning of the French controversy of
disallowing Muslim girls and young women to wear
their head coverings in public school, I have been
unsure how I feel.  On one hand, I understand WHY
the French government feels this is important,
removing signs of religious statement from a publicly
funded institution.

(If the government is really so concerned, then maybe
they should consider a standard school uniform,
provided to students with tax payer's money, so as
to not allow the rich kids to wear expensive,
designer clothes:  an emblem of their own family's
religious devotion to money.)

But on the other hand, it's problematic for a democracy
to prescribe such things, in light of a belief in promoting
freedom.  How is telling someone what to wear or not
wear ever a sign of freedom?

Not only that, but it does seem as though the French
government needs to see how these head scarves
are not just religious, but cultural as well.  When
discussing this recently with a friend, she said, "Yeah,
well if you are Christian or Jewish in Saudi Arabia
you'd be expected to conform to dress code."  But
the goals of a democracy shouldn't be, "Well, they
do this, so we should do that."  A democracy's goal
should be inclusion, to be an example of harmony,
to be bigger and better than the mono-view
governments ruled by religion.

Also, there's the problem of isolating the Muslim
community.  And angering perfectly sensible
citizens can open them up to the dogma of
religious extremists.

On our own shores, America has an ongoing and
endless battle for conduct in the classroom, one
which almost makes me side with the French
government's decision.  America is overwhelmed
with religious fundamentalism which is hell-bent
(so to speak) on capturing and manipulating the
information flow in public schools.  For years now,
born again Christians have run for, and been
elected into school boards and other local
political offices.  All across this country there
are weekly debates about such topics as allowing
Walt Whitman's poems to be taught, on the
grounds that he "promotes homosexuality."

As Rita Odessa--head of the Philadelphia
Gay & Lesbian Taskforce--recently said to me,
"Instead of fighting for better textbooks and
better wages for teachers, and smaller
classroom sizes to improve the education
the children are receiving, we wind up wasting
our time with these ridiculous debates over
Walt Whitman!"

In the end though, isn't anything taught a
form of indoctrination?  An argument could be
made that teaching the joys of economics is
promoting globalization, which I believe it
probably does.  I've met enough stock brokers
to see that few people are losing sleep at night
over trade with countries where the workers
only have two days off a month, and work
13 hour days.  Somewhere behind this is
some nerdy Economics teacher excited about
GNP and showing the young minds the latest
color coded bar graphs mapping out the most
up to date shifts of the DOW.

Am I saying Economics should not be taught?
No, I'm saying that it's almost unheard of that
students are being taught the impact our
economy--and the greed of those who
maneuver it--has on countless lives across
the globe.  No one said it better than La Tzu,
when he said that where there is wealth,
poverty must exist to balance.

I say replace the fucking school prayer time
with readings from the Tao De Ching,
preferably the Stephen Mitchell translation.
Let young minds open to the idea that this
planet is much too fragile to continue
cloaking ourselves behind church and
mosque walls.

My argument is a wash in the end, because
I see both sides, and the answers are too
hidden in the gray.  Striking a balance between
"freedom from" and "freedom to do and be"
is tricky.

In the US, as I see it, the basic social contract is this: you must
agree to be an American first, and whatever else you are second,
third, and fourth. That is to say, the US social contract demands
political loyalty to outweigh loyalty to one's cultural, religious,
familial, and other relationships, in order to make clear to all
citizens that the role of citizenship is explicitly not cultural or
religious or familial or whatever, but, instead, explicitly
political.

From Herb:

<< Looking back on the forty years or so the agency has operated, the
NEA has NEVER made "innovation" in the arts a major priority for
support, either for organizations or individuals. Whatever
organizations or individual artists who received support from the NEA
in the past who work in any of the various "innovative" traditions of
art received the support based on other criteria entirely. The NEA
generally rewards quality and stability, judging both by entirely
subjective means based on information and materials submitted with
application forms.>>

You're right, that's what you wrote.  You didn't say that the NEA "never"
rewards innovation.  You said that the NEA never makes it a priority.  But Herb,
look at what follows.  You write that "Whatever organizations or individual
artists who received support from the NEA in the past who work in any of the
various 'innovative' traditions of art received the support based on other
criteria entirely."  If NEA awards, as you say, are always based on "other criteria
entirely," then you are saying that the NEA NEVER rewards innovation -- which
is precisely what I said that you said.  I was focusing on your paragraph
rather than on one or two sentences.  I don't think I misrepresented you, but if
you think so, you have my apology.

<< You've either got a low threshold of what counts as "innovative" or a
very selective list of Nobel laureates in literature. When I look at
the winners of the Nobel Prize for literature for the last hundred
years, "innovation" is not exactly the first word that comes to mind.
But yeah, something like 5-10% IS literally more often than 1-5%. >>

Well, yes.  I made clear in a couple of posts that I was willing to lower my
threshold almost to the floor.  I wrote, for example, that I'd be satisfied
with conventionally stanza-ed poetry whose content was at least a little edgy.
I posted that one a while ago.  And we agree -- the first percentage range is
better than the second.  So, as I wrote, the Nobel rewards innovation more
often that does the NEA unless, of course, the Nobel also bases all of its awards
on "other criteria."  So much for Claude Simon.

<<I'm not naive about how politics and cronyism work on grant panels
but I've seen these tactics used to support "innovative" work as
often as I've seen them used to disallow "innovative" work. I guess
it's possible that some panelists who are supportive of "innovative"
work wouldn't also try to game the system, but that seems like a lost
opportunity rather than corruption that must be decried.>>

I do not consider you naive.  That's why I wrote that you were not.  RE:
gaming the system:  gerrymandering any system supposedly functioning through
blind submissions, in support of any cause, seems like corruption to me.  Maybe
your threshold for corruption is really high.  But I assume it isn't.  I assume
we both would like a fair system, largely free of political shenanigans,
through which the most creative artists are rewarded.  Sure, I can be cynical about
it all.  I usually am.  I can say to myself, "Hey, there's one more example
of a committee of fuddy duddy intellects and political dickering resulting in
the lowest common denominator.  What else is new?"  There are few issues these
days that get me out of my chair.  Poetry happens to be one of them.

Herb, I get what you're saying, and agree with most of it, and I think most
list members, far from "ignorant" on this score, get it too, including the
difference between the NEA and the MacArthur.  My guess is that those who wrote
"interchangeably" about the NEA and MacArthur were focusing on the results
rather than the process.  If I'm wrong, well, I'm wrong.  You obviously know your
business, as do I.  You, I, and several others on this list have done a fairly
thorough job re:  this issue.  What more can be said?  Good thread!

Best always, Bill

I have to disagree with your negative read on the French head scarf rule.
The French have been historically insistent on secularism in schools. This
policy was not created to humiliate muslims. It was exercised to prevent the
kind of bullying that you mention is happening in American schools. French
public schools do not permit crosses worn outside a student's clothing, &
yarmulkes are likewise forbidden.

To say that it's cultural is to imply that all muslim women are required to
cover their hair. This is not, & has not been true. Neither the Koran nor
the Hadith require women to wear the hijab. Many muslim women do not. Many
others are bullied into it by extremists. And of course, some wear it as a
matter of personal choice.

The fundamentalist requirement of the hijab stems from the belief that women
radiate their sexual energy from their hair. Therefore, it must be
suppressed, so as not to complicate men's lives. We're back to the ol' Eve
Apple in the 21st century.

I agree that nations shouldn't live by Saudi Arabia's standards. It is,
after all, a tyrannical government. But be aware that the push for head
scarves in French schools came largely from Islamist strains that at least
partially agree with Saudi women's attire mandates. The scarf issue is an
Islamist political football, much in the way the nuances of abortion issues
are exploited by the Christian Right here in the USA.

this french head scarf issue is immensely complicated... excellent
analysis in ~the new yorker~ just a few weeks back (18 november),
"beneath the veil," by jane kramer, that really throws into relief
the various factors/factions, aspects of which will doubtless open
some eyes (it did mine, that much is certain)... an interview with
kramer about her article:

http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?041122on_onlineonly01

but really, if you haven't already, check out the article itself...

I am sorry to pass on the sad news of the death, on November 30, of=
 Christophe Tarkos, the energetic and performance-oriented French poet who=
 did so much to enliven new French poetry over the past decade. Christophe,=
 who had been ill for several years, was 40.

Stacy Doris & Chet Weiner edited a selection of his writing for Roof Books=
 (2001):
Ma langue est po=E9tique, Selected Writing.

Our poetry has suffered a blow. But Tarkos's work already shows a means for=
 recovery.=20

I'm with Frank on this one. While there's no question that the right wing
has lined up with the government on this one thing for pretty terrible
reasons, the solid political center is also with it. Good to remember that
the French have centuries of experience with religious divisiveness.

The rich kids, by the way, go to expensive private schools, almost all of
them catholic. There are also lots of less expensive religiously-affiliated
schools of all denominations for the various orthodox. Fancy clothes are
not much of an issue--the kids in the lycees in each of the several
neighborhoods in Paris I've lived in looked ready to be carted away in the
garbage. Judging at least by what one could see through the haze of smoke.

Hard to believe the extent to which France is more democratic than the US.

Subject:  A blurb


This may appear in a local art newspaper here in london. The paper
itself is written for a lower yield of readership, but all papers in
this town are scripted for the lowest common denominator. It is being
considered now, but it pains me that it had to be written in this
style.


corrigenda copy for SCENE:

Six Gallery Press: a not-so-hostile takeover



Not what you would expect of a conventional publisher-writer
relationship, but after the publication of Kane X. Faucher's novel,
Urdoxa, Mr. Faucher self-admittedly "Napoleonized the ailing
publishing house" by transplanting its operations from Pittsburgh,
USA to here in London. In the process, Faucher also supplanted the
former general editor of the press and has now inherited a publishing
house that boasts thirty books in its relatively short period of
operation, including authors such as Che Elias, acclaimed Boston poet
Robert Gibbons, Toronto-based writer and former Danforth Review
contributor aem, and Fifteen Project editor Pat Lawrence. The former
proprietor of Six Gallery Press, Tim Miller, relinquished his role to
Faucher last month, stating fatigue as the reason for the handover.
Faucher's ambitious aim is to continue the press' mandate of
producing experimental, marginalized fiction, but also to include
more Canadian authors in its catalogue. After the initial
restructuring, Faucher's plans for the 2005 publishing year will be
to produce a full-length book by Clifford Duffy, a cutting-edge
Montreal poet whose blog-fictions of Deleuze and Guattari has earned
him a growing international online readership. In addition, Faucher
will also be expanding the press' publishing mandate to include
theory-fiction blends, reflecting his current affiliation with the
University of Western Ontario's Centre for the Study of Theory and
Criticism.

"One of the perennial problems that faced this press,"
reports Faucher, "is that the editor, faced with a glut of literature
the big presses would not touch, tried to publish what he thought
were books deserving of an audience--which turned out to be a task
worthy of Sisyphus. The manuscripts just kept coming, and he simply
just exhausted himself trying to publish too much in too short a
time." By contrast, under Six Gallery Press' new head, the aims are
much "more modest, and a more selective process will be dictated by
available finances as well as according to a very select aesthetic."
The press' sleeker publishing regimen, in addition to its higher
scrutiny for truly experimental texts, fulfills a market niche that
may be even more outside the eclectic literary tastes of such notable
presses as Insomniac and Coach House. "Although I respect the
continuing efforts of our small presses, there is something lacking
in CanLit, a subterranean voice that fails to find representation
among publishers who have large granting bodies to answer to…One of
the chief elements that drew me to Six Gallery Press in the first
place as a suitable milieu to publish my novel was its roster of
writers whose works seem to present a kind of urgent necessity in
their publication, a true chorus of voices in the wilderness whose
works are as timely as they are compellingly daring."

It will be a few months yet before Six Gallery Press can
completely slough off its old skin and produce a new line of books;
but what remains is that Six Gallery Press has found a new home in
Canada, under the welcoming care of an ambitious young writer-turned-
publisher who aspires to erect a viable literary Canadian empire for
the artiste inconnu.

(Thanks to Minky for pointing this site out)

"him name is hopkin green frog" -  http://lostfrog.org/

The Hopkin movement explained:

... sometime in September 2004 the flier was introduced to an online image
sharing community, where it quickly became the subject of a still-growing
set of visual riffs. An enterprising individual soon registered the domain
lostfrog.org, where new contributions continue to be posted.

... Finally, Sunday afternoon, I picked up the phone and dialed the family's
number; to my surprise, the father was there. Here is more or less what he
told me.

First, he was not interested in appearing in a neighborhood newspaper story
about his son's lost frog and the internet. He gave me permission to write
about it here, however. Out of consideration for his concerns, I have chosen
not to explicitly identify the family.

The person who drew the flier is a sixteen-year-old boy who suffers from
autism. His father was unaware that his son may have made more than one
batch of fliers (it appears that new fliers were hung in May of 2004). He
did know about the loss of the frog and I believe that he knew about the
first batch of fliers.

He also did not want me to give the frog to his son. He's forgotten it, he
told me. Bringing it up again will probably only bring up a bunch of bad
memories.

He was quite unaware of the interest in the frog and the flier on the
internet. He reiterated that he did not think it would be a good idea to
show the sites to his son.

... So, then, that's the resolution. Hopkin was lost by an autistic
adolescent; this explains something of the sense of determination that comes
through the initial flier. His family requests that no Hopkins be sent and
that people seeing the Hopkin flier should not call with frog news, or, as I
did, to find out what the story behind the flier is.

Hi CA -

Like large swaths of *every state* in America (except RI, a state ultimately too small to have "swaths" of property), big tracts of French lands are populated by incorrigible bigots: jew-haters, sexists, muslim-haters, and so on.  There's a Nazi flag on display in a pool hall in Strasbourg, where they welcomed in the Nazis sixty years ago with open arms.  They hate America, but only because we're winning the biggest bigot competition.

In France, as in America, rednecks abound.  The hats are different but the heads are the same.

Just like I know a lot of Americans who aren't Bush-lovers, I know a lot of French folks who aren't Muslim-haters.  But for every American who can say, "when you're in Amerikuh bub you best speak Amerukin," you bet your kiester there's a Frenchman who despises every other tongue except his own merde.

Oh but the French will say they're tolerant, as they're giving the right to the Hezbollah (gasp! that group funded and armed by the Iranian blackmail of the entire Reagan administration in response to the October Surprise) to televise their anti-Semitic screed.  Wow, what openness!  "Hey we hate muslims!  But we'll at least give some muslims the right to say why we should also hate the jews!"

The policy is France's own cultural evidence of bigotry, just as George Bush is America's expression of greed ("and a little bigotry on the side--seconds please, m'am!").

What has happened in America is in many ways the legacy of our European forefathers, and in other ways we were formed by a rejection of that legacy.  And then once the children of those who rejected that legacy were finally comfortable, they too joined in the acceptance of the policies that drove their own parents away from home in the first place.

Soon the government of France will capitalize on the opening the US has provided for joining in the exploitation of the middle east, and anti-Muslim policies will help grease the mechanisms of mass rationalization.

Four years ago, in response to the election of George Bush in 2000, my best friend moved to France.  He was back in two years.  His main reason for returning was that, while was able to find quarter for his criticisms of the American government, he could find no such quarter for criticisms of the French government, and he found the pedestrian Frenchman to be *unbearably* bigoted.  Nazi flags and all.  His best friend there was middle eastern; they were both outsiders.  The disdain for them became violent on more than one occasion.  There were places they simply couldn't go.

Well, heck, America was born from British folk lured away from Britain by the French.  And they were all killing the Native Americans.  Spain, Portugal, Germany...history is bloody for all--America has merely become the leader.

It might be argued that what is happening in Europe--particularly in Holland and France--is in response to the idiocy of repressive religions.  But it is riding on the backs of spiteful prejudices, the same sorts of prejudices that fueled the rhetoric of the Bolshevik Revolution with the language of anti-Semitism.

We are not alone: there is indeed other unintelligent life in the universe.

Subject: on forced Secularism

From the beginning of the French controversy of
disallowing Muslim girls and young women to wear
their head coverings in public school, I have been
unsure how I feel.  On one hand, I understand WHY
the French government feels this is important,
removing signs of religious statement from a publicly
funded institution.

(If the government is really so concerned, then maybe
they should consider a standard school uniform,
provided to students with tax payer's money, so as
to not allow the rich kids to wear expensive,
designer clothes:  an emblem of their own family's
religious devotion to money.)

But on the other hand, it's problematic for a democracy
to prescribe such things, in light of a belief in promoting
freedom.  How is telling someone what to wear or not
wear ever a sign of freedom?

Not only that, but it does seem as though the French
government needs to see how these head scarves
are not just religious, but cultural as well.  When
discussing this recently with a friend, she said, "Yeah,
well if you are Christian or Jewish in Saudi Arabia
you'd be expected to conform to dress code."  But
the goals of a democracy shouldn't be, "Well, they
do this, so we should do that."  A democracy's goal
should be inclusion, to be an example of harmony,
to be bigger and better than the mono-view
governments ruled by religion.

There should be no interference in what people want to wear - within
reason - in a school - and if the French were not so (very many of them are)
racist - very racist to Arabs and ironically also to Jews - they would allow
individuals freedom of choice as to what to wear etc and respect their
customs. The French as well as the US has an atrocious colonial record of
oppression) the least they can do is to recognise difference) - it is a
racist and oppressive act by a racist and oppressive government

Taking off headscarves etc  will have no effect on how much "fundamentalism:
there is - or how much homosexuality is "debated" (homosexuality should be
discussed and or debated as to whether it is a good behaviour), or on social
behaviour -and  my general impression of Arabic people (whom the US
Imperialists are intent on murdering as many of as they can) here, is that
they are gentler and often more civilised - however term that is defined -
than many European Kiwis (and others who are not Arabic)  who are
(supposedly) of the Christian ethos.

There is here a crazy right wing fundamentalist group who actually want to
stop homosexuality and they getting quite some support as a gay marriage
bill is being voted on now in NZ's Parliament (Wellington) and also recently
some women from Afghanistan refused to remove their Burkhas in Court - some
bastard of a lawyer tried to force them to do so...

We have to resist this paranoia about "terrorism" - those who drop the bombs
on countries and kill 4 million people in Vietnam Cambodia etc and go on and
on invading and killing and derailing governments throughout the world - or
forcing people into debt and poverty are the real terrorists - the French
are no better than any other Imperialists - in France Arabic people (eg
those from former colonies such as Algeria etc) are very much discriminated
against.  The truth is none of the so-called democratic countries really
believes in individual freedoms and or choice - they fear it, The French
Govt. hate Arabs - its as simple as that.

I'm a bit torn on this question, for a number of reasons; one of which is,
that it is very complex, and racism certainly plays in some of its aspects.
As do gender questions, which bend back on themselves in the questions of
cultural imperialism. But I don't agree with this statement.  Yes, many
French people are racist, no doubt about it; as are many USAmericans, many
Australians, many Malaysians.... I want to ask, so what?

My husband Daniel Keene recently spent a bit of time in the Aubervilliers
school where the hijab question first exploded, as a visiting artist with
the local theatre La Commune, which has a strong program of Social Action
(more on social action, which is very interesting, in a piece by him on my
blog, http://theatrenotes.blogspot.com).  And he said that he totally agreed
with it.  The French do have a right to protect their hard-fought-for
tradition of secularism in schools.  But that's not why he agreed with it.
He spoke to the kids there, and _they_ agreed with it.  Aubervilliers is a
poor part of Paris, with an extremely diverse ethnic mix from North Africa,
the Middle East, you name it.  And the children like being somewhere where,
for a few hours each day, they can just be children at school, and not Arabs
at school, or Jews at school, or Algerians or Africans at school.  To insist
on marking out difference in a place where everyone is already so markedly
different makes their place in relation to each other even more difficult to
negotiate.

It's like how uniforms in state schools eliminates financial hierarchies; if
all the children have to wear the same thing, then the kid who can't afford
the expensive trainers doesn't feel so out of it.

Best

A

Please read, Abstention

I apologize for this note, but feel it's necessary. I've been carrying around
too much anger recently; this is also true of most of my offline friends. Anger
leads to despair, disgust, internal violence. I'm not good at meditating and/or
drugs; my outlets are my work and of course discourse online. But the latter
has become increasingly acerbic on my part, for no reason, especially among
people I respect. I feel I should abstain from discussion at this point; I'm
too out of control. Unfortunately for those of you who find my work spam, I'll
continue to send it out. But beyond that, I'll try silence as much as possible.

The election of Bush, our personal lack of money, my own lack of a future in
the job market (equivalent to a very real lack of a future), all of these
things weigh - not to mention constant insomnia, headaches, stress, problems
with my family. I've been going through the roof, getting up in tears in the
morning. It's not fair to Azure, and not to myself for that matter, although I
don't know how to stop it. But at least I don't need to inflict myself on
people here, online.

I try to keep the rage and despair out of my work. I've been looking at older
work over the past few days, and it feels suicidal. It's hard to face, but I'm
trying to put at least some of it on DVDs, out of deteriorating VHS, 8mm, and
Hi8mm tapes. The sound pops out, tracking is lost, and all the usual shifts are
occurring that happen in analog. In any case, I'm dismayed at the self-loathing
within a number of them, and trying to come to grips with that.

For the rest, I feel my work is on course as usual, whatever that may be. But
I've noted my too-fast responses online - and that serves no useful purpose,
for you or for myself.

I hope to be back in discussion mode soon and please don't take this the wrong
way, whatever that might be.

- Alan

Like other countries don't? And besides, the French record is no

Hi,

I'm proposing to develop an audio + video for some recordings I'll be doing=
 for the next few months. The Audio deals mainly with psycho- and electro-a=
coustics and phenomena of the voice and body. I'm hoping to gather source m=
aterial from anyone who'd like to share any - be it objects in space or fil=
m/video/mpegs/etc. Or anyone who would like to participate in the recording=
s (for voice and/or performance to be cut up and destroyed).

The realizing of sound + object is a continuance of my Ambivalentrinity pro=
ject (formerly with Mark O'Brian and Eric Zurbin in NYC) where the three of=
 us performed "damaged electronics" using found and ill-used electronic ins=
truments and appliances. The last recordings of the Ambivalentrinity were "=
Ambit i + ii + iii" (2001), a 3X3" CD release of minimal tones and overtone=
s, and a live recording from 2000 that has yet to be released.

Please let me know if you can help or would like to contribute ideas/texts/=
sound/video to the project. Everything is welcome.

presents

Poet Lisa Cooper
Visual Artist George Welch
Sunday, December 5, 7 pm
WILDE PLAYHOUSE, 135 E. Congress Street, Tucson
Admission: $5; Students $3

Lisa Cooper grew up in Tucson, eventually earning an MFA in creative writing
from the University of Arizona in 1989. Chax Press published her full-length
collection of poems, & Calling It Home, in 1998, and she won an Arizona
Commission on the Arts fellowship in 2001. Other poems have been published
in numerous literary magazines, including New American Writing, Talisman,
Sonora Review, Hambone, Spork, and others. Her interests include music,
visual art, local history and culture, and the politics of the U.S./Mexico
border. She claims that she has now lived in Tucson for so long that summer
has become her favorite time of year. She works as a book editor for Rio
Nuevo Publishers.


George Welch began in the Bronx but has been in Tucson for more than two
decades, and was one of the original artists teaching when Pima College's
West Campus broke ground. With a master's degree from Bank Street College in
New York, Welch has been painting for 34 years. He is a color field lyrical
abstractionist, and his concerns are chaos, order, yin-yang, and
reconciliation, i.e. with the entire ground of the spiritual in art.
Recently he has been working with illuminants in his exploration of
spiritual and intellectual enlightenment.

POG events are sponsored in part by grants from the Tucson/Pima Arts
Council, the Arizona Commission on the Arts, and the National Endowment for
the Arts. POG also benefits from the continuing support of The University of
Arizona Poetry Center, the Arizona Quarterly, Chax Press, and The University
of Arizona Department of English.

The French fervor for secularism has to do with a long history of beating
back the backward influence of the Catholic Church, which fought for
control of education and other political powers -- so that the schools
become a key site for enforcement of French identity as secular and (in
language) French.  Anyone can become French, as long as they adhere to the
culture and the language, and there is no sense of "multiculturalism" as we
might have in the US.  Certainly, the French have a long pre-Revolutionary
history that includes persecution of the Huegenots, not to mention joining
the Crusades (which massacred Eastern Christians and Jews along with
Muslims), and they have, along with most of Europe, a sordid history of
anti-Semitism (the Dreyfus affair along with Vichy collaborators), and
their own legacy of colonialism.  American history of pluralism and our
version of freedom of speech and religion would welcome scarves in school,
along with Sikh turbans, yarmulkes, and the rest.  But I don't think
Americans should be so smug.  There is a logic, based on their own history
and self-identification, with the French approach.  I'm a little surprised
at the amount of chauvinism expressed on this list -- although I suppose I
shouldn't be.  Pretty soon someone will end up referring to Andre Breton as
a Liberty Surrealist.

We will live post-colonial love stories
Despite our plane-crash-burnt faces one can see how handsome and authentic we

We will listen to post-WW2 straight white male jazzy crooners
Our sadness will testify for our very singularity in the eye of the Other in the

Vacuum tube radios didn’t speak of the napalmisation of Fallujah
Bodies melting through the essence of love
Our so o so hi-brow western way of fee(l/d)ing

I must say this statement shows a narrowness of historical memory that is
disturbing in its chauvinism

"has to do with a long history of beating
> back the backward influence of the Catholic Church"

It must be noted that the original reason for Anti-Clericalism in Catholic
nations was based in economics not politics the Church controlled allot of
land and real estate which the state wished to own.

But to call the Catholic Church an institution that has always had a
"backward influence" simply shows a contemporary bias.  The fact is that the
the influence of Catholicism on France and on all Catholic nations has been
a mixed bag but it has had many progressive and good influences and many bad
ones as have all human institutions.

Some points

1) Please do not bring up the Crusades as sordid without telling the whole
story, the reality is that from 700-1099 it was the Muslims not the
Christians who went on Crusade in two hundred years they conquered Spain,
Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Anatolia not to mention Persia. All of these
nations, except for Persia, were Christian before Islam arrived and these
nations were invaded by Muslim Armies ruthlessly; the Crusades were a
response to a call for help from the Byzantine Emperor. The realities of
this epoch are very mixed and no one; not Islam, not Christianity have clean
hands; the Crusades happened but there is plenty of blame to go around and
it is unfair to blame only the West or Christianity for this era of
violence.

2) The reality is that France and many nations of Catholic Culture have
different senses completely of what a national identity is. While France is
a 'secular' nation there are still many Christian holidays and, at least
with the French people I know well if you ask them they will tell you that
Franch people even if they are atheists are Catholics they exist within a
Catholic culture which is predominant in Latin Europe, Latin America and
other places. Catholic Culture, Jewish Culture, Muslim Culture, Protestant
Culture these are all rich storehouses of history and life and traditions
and should not be demeaned in anyway.

There is much good that has come into the world from Catholicism into
Catholic nations; first off their Latin languages, music, culture,
monasticism, winemaking, books, poetry, and much more. To boil down 2000
years of Catholic culture that includes Bernard of Clairvaux, Chartre
Cathedral, Mozart, the idea for Social Welfare, St Francis, Michelangelo,
and so much more to only highlight the bad is unfair and in my mind
unacceptable. This is not to gloss over the bad things and the evils put
forth but as with any human institution there is good and bad.

3) The problem with Europe today and this goes for all of the nations of
Europe is that unlike the US, Brazil, Australia, Argentina Canada and many
other immigrant nations Europe is a place tied to land and locale. I will
use my own life as an example my parents come from the North of Italy from a
small town, my family has lived in that valley for at least 500 years maybe
more-the people there are tied together by dialect, Food, history, religion
and tradition. Unlike in the USA where people can "become American" in our
region it is not easy to "become" part of our history because it is not
based on an idea it is based on a place and shared culture.

The French to their credit have tried to assimilate Muslims by making them
French in language and culture and by not permitting 'diversity' there is
real merit to this because in many parts of Europe immigrants remain totally
at the margins and perhaps the French have it right? Maybe it is better for
people to assimilate openly and honestly rather than the slow assidious
assimilation of the USA? In the USA we have just as hard an assimilation
policy it is not just legally based it is peer pressure based. Try to get a
corporate job in America if you cannot speak English fluently? Try to live
in an Ethnic Ghetto and see your economic situation grow? The reality is
that if you want to make Money in the USA you have to assimilate and many
ethnic groups, Jews, Italians, Asians, Irish have done so because if they
dont they wont be able to make money which of course is what America is all
about.

This has been a rather interesting thread, topped off by Mr. Bianchi's rambling defense of the poor (? -- how many looted artworks in the Vatican?), misunderstood (by heretics, so-called witches, homosexuals, assorted pagans, who are better off burnt at the stake anyway), Catholic Church.  What's next, a defense of forced conversions in Africa and the Americas?  (It was all for their own good, as I suppose was slavery, since Mr. Bianchi reassures us that throughout it all Chartres Cathedral and, eventually, Mozart were also ad majoram gloriam Dei).

Andre Breton -- from a Catholic country -- put it well: something on the order of "all that is loathsome, swinish, and cowardly is summed up for me in the name 'God.'"

And frankly, Spain had it a lot better under the Muslims than it did following the Catholic Reconquista (see "The Ornament of the World," by Maria Rosa Menocal).  Islamic rule of Al-Andalus placed Jews in high positions (unlike Catholicism, which demonized Jews and as recently as the 1940s was thoroughly complicit with the Holocaust) and in general was far more tolerant than the Papacy has ever been (though let's hear it for the Borgia Pope Alexander, who at least was no hypocrite).  St. Thomas Aquinas had all those infidel Arabs to thank for his chance to read Aristotle, right?

Having said this, I don't believe the French ruling class is on very firm ethical ground in their secularism, given their own complicity in the Holocaust (recently evidenced in their kid-gloves treatment of Maurice Papon) and their colonial wars against Algiers (and that's only the past 60 years).  Fundamentalism, however odious and reprehensible, nourishes itself on the racism that France has constantly deployed against its colonial "others."  For examples of poetic critiques of this racism, do I have to mention the Negritude poets, Frantz Fanon, "The Battle of Algiers"?  Or should I enumerate all the hideous remarks by "distinguished" (and Catholic) Frenchmen assembled by Aime Cesaire in the "Discourse on Colonialism"?

I'm not being chauvinist here; far be it from me to extol the hideous situation of "these States."  Indeed, having been on this list for a while, I find much of it to be "(North) American" in the worst sense -- thoroughly parochial and indifferent to non-Anglo-American poets (example: is anyone calling our attention to Iraqi poets?).

None of these nations were Christian--Christianity had been imposed on them
as a state religion a couple of hundred years before the Muslim conquest
(there were already Christian communities before that, but almost nowhere
in the majority), and they all had large minority populations. The Moslem
conquest was accomplished with far less slaughter of other groups than the
crusades, and treatment of non-muslims was by the standards of the time,
including especially that of contemporary Christian countries, extraordinary.

But sure, Catholicism facilitated the accomplishment of a lot of wonderful
things. So did the Aztec Empire. Both involved untold slaughter, and weird
Christian ideas about the body spiritually crippled millions more. But hey,
I'm Jewish, so it's hard for me to be objective about this.

Incidentally, while most French people, even atheists (probably the
majority), whose families were historically Catholic will tell you that
France remains culturally a Catholic country, very few would tell you that
"they exist within a Catholic culture which is predominant in Latin Europe,
Latin America and other places." Those other places (throw in Ireland as
well) are Catholic in ways that have nothing in common with what your
French friends meant.

I was at a gathering of friends for New Years a few years ago in Paris. New
Years is known by its name in the Catholic calendar, St. Sylvester's Day.
We were downing hecatombs of raw oysters. I was informed that this was a
tradition for St Sylveter's Day, and I asked what the religious
significance was. The answer? "It's when you get the best oysters."

I think that was my point. French secularism was a reaction to the
dominance of the RC, and specifically to its control of all education.

It's maybe a question of where one draws the line. In the US, thanks only
to supreme court decisions that hopefully will survive the coming court
shuffle, we no longer have prayer meetings during the school day. We still
in many parts of the country serve up science to kids through the lens of
religion. Materials used in schools to teach abstinence are generated by
religious groups and funded by the government. Because secularism in many
parts of the country is a novel concept (and not just in the schools) the
attempts to impose a degree of secularism from without are at the moment
more divisive than the religious behavior it excludes. The French aren't
fighting over school prayer or the teaching of evolution.

Unlike ours, French government is totally centralized--what's imposed one
place is imposed every place, and there's no possible argument for regional
particularism, tho parts of France are more pious than others. Which hasn't
kept secularism, in schools and out, safe from buffetting. After the
Franco-Prussian War the right, which was a lot larger than it is now, tried
to reverse the then 100 year old secularism of the state. Sacre Coeur, the
church which dominates the skyline from the top of Montmartre, was built,
with private money, as an expiation for the sins of secularism that had
caused god to bring down his wrath upon France in the form of the military
defeat, and worse, the Commune. Right-wing politics became inseparable from
uiltra-montane catholicism (in turn a reaction to Italian secularism) and
brought forth the Dreyfus Affair. Some of that same right wing formed the
core of complicity with the Nazis. But even in Vichy the schools remained
secular.

As in the rest of Europe the French, largely because of islamic migration,
are facing, after centuries of nurturing their uniqueness, a redefinition
of what it means not only to be French but European. Lots and lots of
problems, but they're not doing such a bad job compared to their own past
and ours. At the core of the effort is secularism. I don't see that there's
another choice.

Nobody has contributed more to secularism, first in Europe and then in
America, than the existentialists. From Nietzsche to the Beats, philosophy and
poetry have been strange bedfellows.  No one has been a more  articulate voice
for common sense, logic, and humanism than Camus who  actually hated the
existentialist label. The individual must reconcile  oneself to the idea that society
isn't going to be comfortable for her.  Religious folk should adjust
likewise. Laws will always favor majorities,  secular or religious, but in order to
protect the rights of minorities,  secularism is a must. All religions should be
banned from public display,  since they usually tend to be nothing more than
elitism and racism, showy,  seductive and intimidating to children no matter
how benign. Poets as a  rule are sloppy philosophers who excel at expressing
their individualism. Maybe  poetry should become the popular mode of expression
rather than the mask of  religion which seeks to put all others into a
manageable herd. Secularism is an  improvement in human discourse, and it should be
encouraged in schools and the  media.

I agree, Joe, it's "convoluted."  The issue of 'self-liberation' versus
imposed 'liberation' seems hauntingly close here to neo-con arguments for
'liberating' democracy in Arab states (where there always seems to be a
self-interested agenda subtext - oil or whatever - also very actively in
place. The 'liberation of women' is used as a subterfuge, is my impression.
Somehow, domestically , a similar logic does not apply to the rights of
homosexuals to have equal rights.)

I am sure there must be evidence in this argument of young muslim women
making arguments for the head scarf that make total sense(??)

In terms of 'head-cover' In the fifties, it was de rigeur for most boys in
this country to have crew cuts (that was all part of military chic -
anti-communism, cold war, et al). Look alike,think alike and defeat the
Reds.  Gosh was it a relief to start to grow hair long like the French,
think independently and then Allen Ginsberg came along and long hair bloomed
all over the place. But to have long hair was by choice, not by government
imposition.  Course now, many go bald as a way of getting closer to even
greater truths than just 'thoughtful' ones.

stephen, yes, check:  in fact you're exactly right... the feminist
stance---or the stance of some feminists in france---seems in some
ways to mirror the (u.s.) neocon argument that we can "liberate"
people by forcing them to be like us... and in fact politics can make
strange bedfellows, as you know, when e.g. antiporn feminists end up
on the same side of the court case as the jerry falwells of the
world...

yet there is nonetheless evidence to support the claim that some
significant number of french women/girls are being pressured to wear
veils by males in their households... fathers, brothers...

i'm not taking hard & fast sides here... i'm simply trying to help
turn the conversation away from what might be a facile liberal
perspective... viz., that we ought to permit everyone to voice their
religious affiliations (?) publicly however they see fit, and w/o any
regard for the historical, national, etc., context in which such
voicing takes place... on the surface of it, this seems entirely
reasonable, esp. on this side of the pond...

but i'm trying to suggest, based on my admittedly limited grasp of
the matter, that there are other forces at work, other wrinkles, and
as some are arguing, the fraught history of secularism in france
needs to be looked at closely, among other things... you can always
take issue with some french feminists, but i think at least that we
ought to have a long hard look at what they're saying, and why
they're saying it... and hey, i've read my share of catherine
mckinnon too...

Oh yes let us argue about who had it better in the Middle Ages from our our
postmodern prism. I did not defend Slavery or
the Holocaust- or the Catholic Church's role in those things and as a
Catholic I accept responsibility for the evil perpetrated by my Church even
if my Church will not accept it and I try in my own life to do what I can to
change things.

World history is  cruel all nations have done evil there is no one cause to
this evil except our humanness. The fact is that if you collect all the
horror of the West, Islamic World, Asian Nations, African nations and the
rest and look at them in the full scope of history there is plenty of evil
to go around. No group is innocent of doing evil things and in fact we in
the US are most guilty because we are hypocrites and we have no right to
attack the French for anything.

Subject: Re: on forced Secularism

This has been a rather interesting thread, topped off by Mr. Bianchi's rambling defense of the poor (? -- how many looted artworks in the Vatican?), misunderstood (by heretics, so-called witches, homosexuals, assorted pagans, who are better off burnt at the stake anyway), Catholic Church.  What's next, a defense of forced conversions in Africa and the Americas?  (It was all for their own good, as I suppose was slavery, since Mr. Bianchi reassures us that throughout it all Chartres Cathedral and, eventually, Mozart were also ad majoram gloriam Dei).

Andre Breton -- from a Catholic country -- put it well: something on the order of "all that is loathsome, swinish, and cowardly is summed up for me in the name 'God.'"

And frankly, Spain had it a lot better under the Muslims than it did following the Catholic Reconquista (see "The Ornament of the World," by Maria Rosa Menocal).  Islamic rule of Al-Andalus placed Jews in high positions (unlike Catholicism, which demonized Jews and as recently as the 1940s was thoroughly complicit with the Holocaust) and in general was far more tolerant than the Papacy has ever been (though let's hear it for the Borgia Pope Alexander, who at least was no hypocrite).  St. Thomas Aquinas had all those infidel Arabs to thank for his chance to read Aristotle, right?

Having said this, I don't believe the French ruling class is on very firm ethical ground in their secularism, given their own complicity in the Holocaust (recently evidenced in their kid-gloves treatment of Maurice Papon) and their colonial wars against Algiers (and that's only the past 60 years).  Fundamentalism, however odious and reprehensible, nourishes itself on the racism that France has constantly deployed against its colonial "others."  For examples of poetic critiques of this racism, do I have to mention the Negritude poets, Frantz Fanon, "The Battle of Algiers"?  Or should I enumerate all the hideous remarks by "distinguished" (and Catholic) Frenchmen assembled by Aime Cesaire in the "Discourse on Colonialism"?

I'm not being chauvinist here; far be it from me to extol the hideous situation of "these States."  Indeed, having been on this list for a while, I find much of it to be "(North) American" in the worst sense -- thoroughly parochial and indifferent to non-Anglo-American poets (example: is anyone calling our attention to Iraqi poets?).

the problem with some people

bothered by other people
my ears open out only one way
and  swallow everyone's
pain pain pain pain
yes yes i see
some are all  ears
no tongue
their heart in their ears
til finally they're  deaf
numbed by the suffering
of others
their tongue still
silent  they retreat
with heart into their head
to survive alone trapped
safely  entombed embalmed
reluctant beauty preserved in ice
solitary ---cold---  stars
who cared too much
nobody listened to them
poor them poor  me
after all we're all
wounded bleeding screaming
what can we offer  except
the sound of our blood
usually the wrong type
no longer safe to  offer anything else
like timeless blissful entanglement
where hearts meet  in flesh
sigh moan hot wetness
so simple no more
flesh heart tongue  head
i've passed the point no return
less than human hope not
mebbe  i'll meet one of them
poor deaf frozen tongue hearts
mebbe i can  talk

tell me something about yourself
let your heart and your mind

whether tangled and twisted

tell me the dreams from before you grew hopeless
the truth not the  lies
about love and its promise
bring the pain and the longing back into  view
tell me your dreams
and i=E2=80=99ll dream with you

Rcism is one o the "fuellers" of Imperialist wars - but see Patrick's
post on this - he has been right throughout Europe and experienced racism
(as anti-semitism) and he has also been targetted by the CIA for protests
against  US actions in Angola etc. Ok not all French people are racist -
that is of course a given - but if we are criticising US Imperialism (and
British,and Australian (in Indonesia etc) and New Zealand (we have done our
fair share and our present Governmnet actually suppports the US - but
pretends not to - they sneaked troops in to Iraq (and had a navy presence
there) and turned a blind eye to NZ "security " people on very high wages
protctcting US andother in the Invasion: Phil Goff (Minister of  -
(Internatinal Affairs or whatever it is) is very pro the War on Terror (and
hence the Invasion of Afghahistan etc); and many many other countries - we
have to include the French and remember that the French Government  - if the
US was defeated in Iraq would in all probabilty rush to fil the gap - they
are capitalists and very right wing elements amongst them.  (This knowing
their appaling record in Indochina and Northern Africa - French agents also
sank a ship "The Greenpeace" in Auckland in 1986, kiling an Italian crew
member - let;s not forget teh French Imperialist aims) ). Racism is what
fuels opression. Thus it aids the US/Birtish Imperialists etc to target
Moslems and others (it is alos Africa) - any counrty whose people are
different - of course it doesnt and wouldnt stop them bombing a "Western
Nation" if it came to it and France eg. decided to send troops into Iraq to
defend freedom then US and France would go to war and the US would probably
attack France. If they had sent tropps to defenmd Iraq I would have ahd
great respect for them - put your money where your mouth is.  But France is
basically another capitalist/Imeperialist nation - they also have ambitions
of power and want acces to oil and drug cash as the US now have.

Wearing scarves doesnt affect secularism - if you have a truly demcratic
country you can stand all views and attitudes - you can have some one
promoting Moslemic religion, Christianity, Judaism, communism, anarchism etc
etc in fact that is how society is these various groups live with each
other - any 'conflict'  of this can be stimulating -  and experience of
difference can be interesting - I would not feel threatened if I attended
University or school and all the women or young women or girls wore
Burkhas - that would be their choice - imagine the reverse - that they all
turned up naked every day - well I would tolerate that (I would have to ) -
but to inject some humour - I like women to have at least some clothes on!!
That is - before the fun and games begins..but note I said 'within reason'
nakedness is impracticable! Maybe nakedness wouldn't matter -it is the
behoviour of poeple - what people's religious or political veiws etc are
dont matter - especailly if they can be debated  with or at least they are
allowed to make a "statement" (as eg gays make statements by their clothes
or exagerated actiosn etc - or holding hands etc etc - or some gays prefer
to be undemonstrative - now seeing a lot of people wearing scarves or
Burkhas or whatever or even some sporting  Hitler moestaches means a
stimulating environment for people - diversity encourages tolernce and is
challenging to young minds. Repression of different religious practices or
habits or cultures or whatever - or dress codes - is stupid and
conservative: it is dscrimminant and racist as well in its effect -
divisive: if those wearing Burkhas come from countries that are supposedly
repressive  (although as I said 2 women here are adament they want to wear
Burkhas - (they do so from choice not from being repressed as the propaganda
goes)) -of their situasion or their beliefs: we feel are "backward' then we
have to learn that that is how it is for them and our "backward" may indeed
be their foreward - we have to be careful thinking we are more civilised
than arabic or moslem peoples.

With respect - I hold the opposite view on this diference is good.
Negotiation is learnt in the "battlefield of the "real world - there could
even be fist fights at what I might call a "healthy" school - but teacher
etc will learn methods to show how people are different by questioning or
revealing the truth about history and the world - thus to be able to
negotiate is better than fistticuffs.  At my old high school I saw a number
of fights by young men and others standing up for themselves - but most
conflict was resolved by various methods we all employ in our daily
intercourse with others - by negotiation, politenessss, discussion,etc etc

As addenda - banning certain religious dress codes is as stupid as banning
the Bible, Das Kapital, modern art, the Koran, Buddism, Mien Kempf, Roland
Barthes,books about homosexuality, books on whatever, even people who are
Nazis: now once a "school", or any other group is formed that group will
find ways to "regulate" behaviour that is not felt right by the majority -
not by suppressing views  - but by  opposing hurtful or divisive attitudes
by strong arguments - or strong action if the activity - behviour becomes
very bad or very despicable.

I take your point on this  and for my childrens' uniforms were at least good
to a point (it was costly to pay for our childrens edu but not too bad) -
but I think we should be not be concentrating on what people wear or if some
particular child is better dressed etc - we need to strengthen their
self-eteem so that dress - or the poverty (shown by) of it or not etc is not
a big issue for them. In daily life we see ea vast aray of different dresses
and cultural kinds -- here in Auckland I see the Sikhs, women almost totally
covered , women partially covered (from the Middle East),Hinus with spots on
their heasd or scarves, (I quite often find some very enlighted and educated
Indian women helping to run dairies in this working class area of Auckland
(Panmure);  Maori who are often sloppily dressed on purpose - or have (US
"rap" kind of clothes), Maori who are well dressed, old Europeans who are
dressed like Steptoe of Steptoe and Son, homels people rummaging in rubbish
bins etc, Chinese who always seem to manage to look well dressed, the
"indigenous" Chinese who are "real Kiwis"; amd those who are kiwis who dress
as "rough as guts" like yours truly, and so on, in K Road gays and
transvestites parade the streets, or young women come out of night clubs in
very low slung jeans and so on - but ultimately it boils down to this (said
the crayfish) - we have a vast divergency of people and views in the "real:
world and so it should be in schools.

But the Moslems were targetted for strong political reasons that go beond
many of these arguments: it is part of world wide right shift to fascism and
as Imperialism enters into whirlpools of major crises and cycles of over
production - The War of Terror has been taken into French schools.

Secularism isnt the only "way": and also why should religion be banned from
public display?  (Your post started out well - for me! - lol-  but this I
dont agree with) ....I say this while I am not religious myself - I have my
own world view which is not  strictly - if  at all -  atheistic.

Azar Nafisi--whose book, Reading Lolita in Teheran, people on this list
should read, if you already haven't--makes the point that when the Islamic
Republic enforced its own version of the Islamic code of female dress, it
essentially hijacked religion to a political purpose, and she uses the
example of either her mother or her grandmother (I don't have the book handy
and my memory here is a little sketchy), who'd covered her head for entire
life as an expression of her religious faith, but who protested adamantly
against her government's policies as a corruption of that faith. It's worth
asking whether what this thread is calling "forced secularism" does not on
some level function in an analogous way. In other words, whose political
interests does it serve--and I mean here by "whose" the people who are in
power or who want to be in power, not the individual children who go to
school or their families, etc.--and how and why?

This seems to me a separate question--though I think these two are often
conflated, and I think are being conflated in this thread--from whether the
wearing of the chador or hejab is misogynist, forced on women by the men of
their families and so on. This latter question is one that needs to be taken
on in the context of Islam, its history, its religious scholarship, the
differences between and among its various sects, the cultural differences
between and among its practitioners, and so on--not in the name of cultural
relativism, but as a matter of respect. In other words, the fact that there
are Muslim women who will tell you that they do indeed feel protected by
their chador or hejab--the first being the long black robe often associated
with Iranian women after the revolution in that country and the second being
only a head scarf--does not justify taking a stance which says, "Ah, well,
that's their culture, and they accept it, and so if that's the way they want
to do things, well it's all right, then." (Because, ultimately, if the veil
is indeed an expression of women's oppression--and, to me, as long as it is
understood within Islam to mean something about the protection of women from
male sexual predation and/or the quarantining of female sexuality within
male defined and controlled bounds, it is an expression of women's
oppression--then cultural relativism is a cop out.) But the fact that there
are Muslim women who embrace the way their version of their religious
tradition teaches them to dress does mean, however, that any critique of
that dress code needs to come from a position of understanding of Islam and
not from the patronizing assumption that
"we-who-do-not-expect-our-women-to-walk-around-with-their-heads-covered" are
somehow "more civilized."

Then, of course, there are the issues people have raised of anti-Arab racism
and imperialism and Muslim-hatred and the historical experience out of which
France's policy emerges, and I do not want to deny the importance of any of
these, but they all seem not to ask the question I started with: Whose
political interests does this policy serve and how and why? What agenda is
it a part of? Is that agenda, are the people who represent those interests,
trustworthy?

And yes, I realize these questions lead us into precisely the questions of
racism and sexism, etc. that I just outlined. What I am trying to get at
here is that these questions do not exist in this situation as abstractions;
they are embodied by specific people and parties and groups and interests
within French politics/the French government--and it is that analysis that I
have not seen, and that I freely admit I might very well have missed, in
this thread.

It isn't policy to ban scarves from public schools, but to ban all
religious symbols from public schools, including crosses, mezuzahs, stars
of david and yarmulkes. So the question is equally: whose political
interests are served by banning crosses, etc.?

I was in France when the controversy first erupted over the scarves of four
little girls in a small city in central France (sorry, I forget which). The
school principle told them and their parents that the scarf would have to
go or the girls couldn't attend. The girls, or more probably their parents,
refused to comply. I think it safe to assume that there were only the four
girls because all over France a great many others, probably not previously
aware of the regulation, had complied. In this case there were
demonstrations which spread to other towns. It seemed pretty clear that
what was being expressed in most cases had more to do with pent-up
frustrations about the other indignities of immigrant life than with
religion per se. Most French moslems are as secular as most French
Christians, and of the remainder most aren't adherents of sects that
require the scarves. For the remaining minority there are
religioyusly-affiliated private schools, the expense of which could
probably be largely alleviated thru the funding of scholarships by wealthy
muslims, as in catholic and jewish schools (there have been, as far as I
know, no protests by orthodox jews or catholics about the unfairness of
having to pay for their childrens' educations).

I would suggest that the solution to the problem probably follows from its
causes: if the motivation for most of the noise is the general condition of
muslim immigrants in France then something has to be done about those
general conditions. Hard to do given the constant influx from countries
where there's little economic opportunity, and some of the resulant
problems are pretty graphic. I've seen young north african men patted down
by the cops for no apparent reason, I've occasionally heard racist remarks
(and probably would have heard them a lot more often in the south, where
refugee pieds noirs settled in large numbers and where economic conditions
for everyone are more strained). And poverty is like everywhere else the
usual state of newly arrived immigrants. But French daily life is hardly
segregated, and there are lots of middle class muslims. The first
requirements are language skills and education. My Algerian dentist, whose
clientele was mixed but mostly "French," had both, and he considered
himself French, as well. And the cultural influence flows both ways, often
with no apparent barriers. It being France, this is most evident in food.
Everywhere North African food has become a staple. At a Breton folk
festival and at the theater festival in Avignon, which is to say from one
end of the country to another, the intermission food of choice is merguez,
a tunisian lamb sausage. And when the kids got together to dance afterwards
a lot of the music was north african fusion (sorry again, I forget what
that's called).

True enough, and this was in a sentence that I accidentally edited out of my
post--the point of my post was not to ask whose interests are served by
banning head scarves, but rather whose are served by what has been labeled
in this thread forced secularism?

Long story short, my 4th Sunday Santos Open Mic in San Diego has been
cancelled due to the cafe itself closing its doors.  Problems with the City

My feeling is that democratic governments have more to fear from monotheism
and its agenda than from anything else. When faith-based, there is no
dialogue, just the truth-knowing smirk you see on evangelical faces. While
democracy is built on a foundation of discussion, compromise, and secular
education. So I can see why the French government, in wisdom gained from
history, would do this. While the US government seems bent on
self-destruction. The Old World rises anew, even as the New World falls from
the worshipping of old gods.

Duncan's Passages was a life long poem
Blaser's Holy Forest is a work that spanned something like 40 years or more.  It was collected into one book in the '90's , but is one big "serial poem" in the Spicer sense of the word.
And Spicer had quite a discourse on the serial poem.

Though it's a wonderful poem, and definitely long, I don't think Stanford's The Battlefield Where
the Moon Says I Love You should be considered a serial poem because it is not divided into parts
-- no numbered sections, no stanza breaks, not even any punctuation.

Besides Spicer, can people recommend other critical works on serial poems?  I think ML Rosenthal
and Sally M. Gall's "The Modern Poetic Sequence" is ok, but limited.

As for lifelong serial poems, I'd add Thomas McGrath's "Letter to an Imaginary Friend" to the
list.  Would HD's Trilogy count?

Just like not every follower of Islam is a terrorist, neither is every
(evangelical) Christian holier-than-thou. The root of this
misunderstanding, Joel, is I feel a failure of non-Christians to read
the Christian writings and formulate one's own opinion of the foundation
of evangelical faith. I think you are postulating here without any real
knowledge of the true foundations of Christianity. To me, anyone who has
bothered to read the New Testament cannot help but find a vast diversity
of dialogue, compromise, and discussion, because that is exactly what is
there to be found.

Everything, in fact, is continually left open to dialogue in the
evangelical writings and are *very democratically* arrived at: so much
so that no less than 4 separate and contrasting accounts of the main
doctrine (the 4 gospels of Jesus' ministry) are included in the cannon.
This is a conscious effort to democratically seek the truth and avoid
Mosaic-like peremptory commands. (It is unfortunate that the Gospel of
Mary Magdalene was not included as a 5th gospel, instead of apocrypha,
to likewise avoid any claims of patriarchal viewpoints).

Christian authors, in fact, rarely dismiss any chance at open dialogue.
Paul (author of a great deal of the New Testament) often indicates that
he speaks only according to his own opinion and regularly chooses
doubtful language and expressions which admit perplexity (such as
Rom.3:28 "We think, therefore..."; Rom 8:18 "Now I think..."). All the
Christian apostles likewise reason from the stance of argument.

Everything the apostles wrote in the New Testament is plainly presented
as deduction and argument: it is entirely open to discussion. When Paul
states in 1Cor10:15 "I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say..." he
deliberately opens things up to discussion, encouraging others to debate
the issue.  Indeed, the personal path (one's own judgment and carefully
considered opinion) is given the highest-regard in the Christian faith.

Often New Testament writers are even at complete variance with each
other, such as James who claims man is justified by 'works' alone and
not by faith (Jam.2:24) and Paul who states the exact opposite (Rom
3:27,28). Never is the Christian-faith confined to just a few elements
written in stone, unchangeable, or even hinting at a 'truth-knowing'
smugness. On the contrary, as we see Paul indicate in Rom15:20 ("another
man's foundation...") diversity was prevalent in the evangelical
message. Christian foundations are actually rich in diversity opinion,
compromise, quarrel, and openness to discussion.

Am entering into the middle of this bowl of serial discussion.  How about
The Odyssey and The Illiad?  Homer is self-critiquing and seemingly conscious
of what he's including and not including in recreating oral mythology.  How
about looking back to other ancient
narrative poetic tellings/expressions? Isn't The Canterbury Tales a serial
poem?  How about Gwendolyn Brooks' The Anniad?  Marilyn Hacker's, Love,
Death and the Changing of the Seasons?  Ted Berrigan's Sonnets, Lyn
Hejinian's, Oxota: A Short Russian Novel (in Pushkin sonnets).

Derek:

I'm well aware of the history of Christianity, but I'm not talking about the
past, but the rhetoric we hear from evangelicals now that appeals to the
worst in people, and that got George W. re-elected over their own best
interests and that of their children. It's not a matter of what's in a book,
but how it's carried out. Faith-based religion has no "diversity (of)
opinion, compromise, quarrel, and openness to discussion," which is why it's
faith-based. "Take it on faith," is the expression. Or Bush's divine
inspiration to invade Iraq and kill thousands of innocent people, has no
place in a democracy.

why did the elephant pack a trunk? because his nose was broken.
past all acceleration the hyperaccelerator brings particles to fruition.
why was the giraffe a foot? because he was looking for food.
why did the pangolin weigh himself? because he carried his own scales.
why did the beetle play guitar? because she was one of the beatles.
why did the swordfish dual? because there were two of them.
why did the bullfrog die? because he croaked.
why did the flamingo have a leg up on the competition? because she
couldn't stand it. why didn't the cricket play baseball? because he
played cricket. why wasn't the horse blind? because she was a sea-horse.
why did the ant attack the grasshopper? so he would cry uncle.

why was the kaon manic-depressive? because she broke the laws of symmetry.

what is a serial poem? or - how do we define it - why should a poem have a
beginning or an end? what is a poem? here again someone makes a
suggestion/statement and Comrade Bowering withers it with his acid....but I
would say that the Iliad (or the Odyssey) is not a poem in the way that even
Milton's "Paradise Lost" is an epic poem (originally oral) ..[.and indeed a
bit hard to see it a  serial poem but of course  there may be a case for
it(he modelled on the great epics of course), Homer - is it Homer? [
possibly Homer in the sense that the oral poem was also potentially an
ongoing saga  or series of stories which have been lost ( but as with eg
Beowulf etc it had a fromulaic aspect which is now echoed  perhaps in the
modernist and postmodern "sagas") - but not perhaps such a conscious
'radical artifice' (Perloff's pharse) as such - hmmm, maybe: good point her
possibly overlooked by the Great Monisuer Bowering of Canada - hmmmf!??] -
the serial poem I think is something (new?) - I think it is something
qualitatively different from The Odyssey etc -  like Zukofsky's "80
Flowers" - which I came upon in 1992 (I was able to copy the copy of it that
the English Dept had at Auckland Uni) and then read about it in Michelle's
Leggott;s book on it  - the thing about 80 Flowers is - and what interested
me - was its projectful nature, and the way he took 80 (real) flowers (one
pun he uses is that flour and flower have the same root - and indeed a keen
Chaucer man  - he refers thus to The Parlement of Foulys (grew them,
watched, and thought of them, read or remembered and wrote his poems of and
to? each one - I am no great enthusiast for the poems as poems only (I must
look again at Zukofsky) - but what interested me was the idea of a poem that
was basically a part of a person's life: the growing of something(so) was
mirrored in the growing of his great poem(s) - well in a sense all poetry
is - but here we have the self-conscious project - well as Milton and
perhaps Homer also did - but in Zukofsky's case there is now a great
literary knowledge; a hstory of texts, a textual empire behind him; a
fascination with words and their etymology (perhaps Homer had less such
knowledge  - but who knows? ) - perhaps fascination that borders on
obsession - but the concept is excellent - wonderful - and his children (yes
he had/has only one son - ok his family - the flowers part of his
family-extended?)) - his family  - are central/very significant to that poem
(or are part of the leitmotifs or motivations or what you will of the peom)
and especially to "A" which I have to say I know of etc - have read some -
but have not read right through - but again the thing is a long project -
the serial poem can - I would say - either be of a series of 'episode's' or
almost continuous as a diary (Heijinians "My Life" is theoretically infinite
as she can rewrite her diary after each year of her life or each ten years
(this conundrum arises in Tristram Shandy..and Borges points to it in his
story about  the 1001 nights); it is implicitly infinite - though it has to
be cautioned that as far as I know mathematicians are not certain whether
infinity can really be allowed (calculators give ERROR if a number is
divided by zero - try it - so): so we are in a time when there are hundreds
of examples of the serial poem or process - I feel that potentially,
anything can be a poem: a poem is not finished just postponed or something
to that - in a way the serial poem struggles to emulate life it is moving in
one way toward the (Horace - was it - I don't understand what Horace says
about art and life - or not properly can Monsieur Bowering or someone
enlighten me? I know J. Ashbery has a poem with the title Ars Poetica..)
effect
of emulating life - that is, toward _more_ realism -in this sense that  in
'real life' things don't stop -(although here let's note one thought -maybe
all these long poems - these old and modern epics up to Alan's and others -
maybe they are also our way of fighting death (maybe all creativity is
just - or componented of - that ) - but the vast/continuous or seemingly
continuous aspect of such works  keeps us suspended - a kind of spell we
poets enact to ward off our annihilation  - and death or suicide as Camus
says is the most important question of our lives? no? - - everything goes
on - even when we sleep: so why should a poem stop or end - but in say
Silliman's 'Alphabet' as far I can see it is finite (but possibly also
implied infinite) ..I suppose that is for scholars of the future to ponder
and argue: someone here - on this poetics list - once took the words and
wind out of my mouth and sails by suggesting that here on this list or
indeed in cyber space we have a simulacrum or a process going on that at
least mimics life itself -is life - but life looking at life changing life
by being a poem - because what is a poem? is it or could it not be
everything??

Postmodernism has achieved this in opening the possibilities for ideas and
great creativity - permission is given (why did ever need it ) for  Bruce
Andrews's poems that craze all over the page full of brilliantly distorted
phrases; that are pungent or witty or funny; or sometimes nearly beautiful -
Heijinian actually introduces mystery and ostranie -a trend or technique
that is the one of the salient - or one of the major accomplishments of the
language poets  not to neglect the concentration of small units down to word
fragments - highlighting the signifiers as particles and the signifiers at
the sentence level, an also the "torsion, the paratacticality etc" -
following on  the road modernism initiated - where is the break between
Mallarme to Eliot to Bernstein, Coolidge, Heijinian and on to Rachel Blau du
Plessis's long poem and others? The "exploded" poem is multi-possible -
fragmented or it is a "discrete series", always evading our complete
comprehension -of course these things can be said of many of the symbolists
and modernists - what exactly (or what inexactly) is the difference" ?

To what degree has cyber space and this alos vispo and the conflation of
visual art and langauge etc enlightened or intensified the poem - is the
global village happening? Not really - but the possibilities are
there....especially as more of those who are in "Third World countries come
on line -or will they will everyone become day able to contribute to the
vast poem of  existence?

Alan Sondheim has been firing out two poems a day since I was on here in
2000 - without (as far as I know) a break - I don't know how long he has
been going, or will go - and with the multi medial nature of his (seemingly
endless) work ( a kind of seamless (I pun not))serial poem rivalling - what
? - Finnegan's Wake ? - in its potential immensity reference and so on

Okay, then here's one that's both a serial and a cereal poem.

Oatmeal Deluxe

This morning, because the snow swirled deep
around my house, I made oatmeal for breakfast.
At first it was runny so I added more oatmeal,
then it grew too thick so I added water.
Soon I had a lot of oatmeal. The radio
was playing Spanish music and I became
passionate: soon I had four pots of oatmeal.
I put them aside and started a new batch.
Soon I had eight pots. When the oatmeal cooled,
I began to roll it with my hands, making
small shapes: pigs and souvenir ashtrays. Then
I made a foot, then another, then a leg. Soon
I'd made a woman out of oatmeal with freckles
and a cute nose and hair made from brown sugar
and naked except for a necklace of raisins.
She was five feet long and when she grew harder
I could move her arms and legs without them
falling off. But I didn't touch her much -
she lay on the table - sometimes I'd touch her
with a spoon, sometimes I'd lick her in places
it wouldn't show. She looks like you, although
your hair is darker, but the smile is like yours,
and the eyes, although hers are closed. You say:
But what has this to do with me? And I should say:
I want to make more women out of Cream of Wheat.
But enough of such fantasy. You ask me
why I don't love you, why you can't
live with me. What can I tell you? If I
can make a woman out of oatmeal, my friend,
what trouble could I make for you, a woman?

also, by Lynn Keller, Forms of Expansion: Recent Long Poems by Women
(University of Chicago Press, 1997)

I agree with George Bowering, that "long poem" doesn't always mean "serial
poem" -- and "life poem" is a third term altogether that may or may not be
serial. In that sense, Shakespeare's Sonnets are much more a "serial poem"
than The Iliad or The Odyssey. Yet sonnet sequences may be seen as
collections, with each poem not necessarily a part, rather a whole unto
itself. And while it's been said that Stanford's The Battlefield Where The
Moon Says I Love You is not a serial poem because it's not in parts, it may
be considered a "life poem."

In terms of Blaser's The Holy Forest, I take it not to be so much a serial
poem a la Spicer, but more a recognition that all of one's poetry makes up
a single work, a kind of "grand collage" (part of a greater "grand collage"
into which all of our works enter and from which they are derived) a term I
associate more with Duncan, although I associate that basic recognition
with Zukofsky.

I would think Stein's Stanzas in Meditation is a serial poem.

Joel, you appear to have confused your understanding of current
faith-based religions (esp. Christianity) and do not attend to the
objective facts available to all concerning diversity of opinion,
compromise, quarrel, and openness to discussion. I am aware of many
Christian churches which allow, for instance, leading roles for women
(female preachers, pastors, etc.) and of course there are churches which
support sexual diversity and endorse openly gay preachers, pastors, etc.
These are compromised positions brought about by open discussion,
quarrel, opinion, and democratic processes. Most denominations and
congregations have democratic votes to decide all church issues. In
fact, as I have been saying, democratic process, inclusion, diversity,
etc. is the whole point of most faith-based institutions -- indeed that
is what makes them faith-based!! The idea of basing your religion on
faith (a personal act) is so there is no 'work' one can perform and
'point at' (ie. circumcision) but instead each person is valued equally,
regardless of gender, regardless of sexual diversity, regardless of
social-class, etc. Faith-based religion is non-idolatrized religion, in
other words, it is secularly-deduced religion, which is every single
person comes to their *own* terms with God (ie. through faith). You're
conclusions about faith-based religion (esp. Christianity), Joel, are
all wrong.



..|  the rhetoric we hear from evangelicals...
..|  that got George W. re-elected over
..|  their own best interests

Clearly, Joel, you seem to know what's better for people than they do
themselves. According to your 'rhetoric', we should abandon democracy
and install you as supreme leader! You seem to know everybody's best
interests! It is impossible, I think, that people have consciously
chosen to vote against 'their own best interests' (I cannot believe you
would assert such a proposition). People re-elected George W precisely
because the majority found him to be the better alternative for their
own best interests. I absolutely deny that any hocus-pocus of word-play
hypnotized the populace etc. ('evangelical rhetoric') and even if this
was the case then poets have the advantage being so rhetorically minded:
where are your abracadabra'ed slaves? (I'm not referring to 'yes'-man
networks, or maybe I am?)


..|  Bush's divine inspiration to invade Iraq

True sadness Joel. It is unfortunate that people continue to buy into
'the rhetoric' of Bush's divine inspiration (a PR move to bumble
Christian-haters) and like crazed loons believe the real reason the
armies of the United States of America (+ usa-kissing coalition) have
invaded Iraq is out of some 'divine inspiration'. There is not a voter
or non-voter alike in America who believes (even deep-in-their-heart
where their consciously aware belief might hide out) the true reason we
are in Iraq is to fight terror or the result of some Mosaic-like divine
command. Everybody, and their mother too, knows USA + money-hungry
friends have invaded Arabia for its abundant natural resources: namely
its OIL. Any talk of 'divine inspiration' is a choice to jump ship from
'reality' headlong into a preference to debate useless
theological-motivations when the true incentive (oil) is widely known,
entirely understood by every last inhabitant on planet earth, and only
thinly disguised as a 'war on terror' for big media captions and for
those of us who don't-have-the-balls to look at things above-board
without useless window-dressing (burlesque media-dressing, that is).

Save your divine commandments for Jews to slaughter untold Palestinians
because they believe God told them expressly to do so. There are no
divine inspirations in Christianity (Gal.1:8) and this is made
abundantly clear.


..|  "Take it on faith," is the expression

Again, all this expression wishes to convey intellectually is the
equivalent of 'gut-feeling' (a personal experience, not transferable to
another -- in essence a question to every individual to make up their
own mind ~ "Can you take it on faith? Does you faith allow this?" etc.).
We all have gut-feelings and acting on them, or supporting another's,
may be beneficial, or maybe not. Having faith is no way akin to divine
inspiration and if you knew something of Christianity you should know
this too. Faith is action based on belief and sustained by confidence:
which means it is nothing more than courage to trust oneself and face
the day-to-day. It is an ugly twisting of the truth to suggest when
someone claims 'faith' that they act out of divine commandment. There
are no divine commandments in Christianity and no 'works' to be
performed (everything is already 'finished'): this is the whole point of
the New Testament and why the Old Testament ends with a curse.

jesus christ, derek (oops, sorry), what joel is saying, and it's
patently obvious, is that judeo-christian religion is being used by
the bush administration, in various forms and in various ways, to
sanction its various actions, globally and domestically... and
clearly, SOME judeo-christian true believers---not all, but a great
many---believe that the way, the truth, and the light are to be
located thusly...

these people, that is, are obviously not all hoodwinked by bush &
co... they actually believe that bush & co represent The Way That God
Wants The World To Be... we know this based on What These People Are
Saying... just turn on the telly or am wireless, lordsakes...

now as to the question of whether christian doctrine is fortified or
bastardized by the bush agenda, or both, we'd probably have first to
ask whether there IS any "pure" christian doctrine as such, untainted
by centuries of interpretation and power plays... and this "thread,"
like any thread, is probably not capable of withstanding such a vast
historial exposition, esp. one with such politically-charged
overtones...

i'm going to keep this short... i would really appreciate it if you
might keep your response (inevitable, i suppose) equally short---and
if you don't mind, w/o parsing my post (somehow i really never liked
that (literal) method of "reading" these off-the-cuff scribbles that
i send off into the ether)... this way we might cut to the chase and
maybe i could figure out what your agenda is, other than defending
christianity... which doesn't really need defending, if only b/c
christianity per se is not really on trial here, but also b/c the
power in this country and elsewhere is clearly not, and has never
been, with us atheists and agnostics...

best,

joe

a final reminder

TONIGHT:

POG
presents

Poet Lisa Cooper
Visual Artist George Welch
Sunday, December 5, 7 pm
WILDE PLAYHOUSE, 135 E. Congress Street, Tucson
Admission: $5; Students $3

Lisa Cooper grew up in Tucson, eventually earning an MFA in creative writing
from the University of Arizona in 1989. Chax Press published her full-length
collection of poems, & Calling It Home, in 1998, and she won an Arizona
Commission on the Arts fellowship in 2001. Other poems have been published
in numerous literary magazines, including New American Writing, Talisman,
Sonora Review, Hambone, Spork, and others. Her interests include music,
visual art, local history and culture, and the politics of the U.S./Mexico
border. She claims that she has now lived in Tucson for so long that summer
has become her favorite time of year. She works as a book editor for Rio
Nuevo Publishers.


George Welch began in the Bronx but has been in Tucson for more than two
decades, and was one of the original artists teaching when Pima College's
West Campus broke ground. With a master's degree from Bank Street College in
New York, Welch has been painting for 34 years. He is a color field lyrical
abstractionist, and his concerns are chaos, order, yin-yang, and
reconciliation, i.e. with the entire ground of the spiritual in art.
Recently he has been working with illuminants in his exploration of
spiritual and intellectual enlightenment.

POG events are sponsored in part by grants from the Tucson/Pima Arts
Council, the Arizona Commission on the Arts, and the National Endowment for
the Arts. POG also benefits from the continuing support of The University of
Arizona Poetry Center, the Arizona Quarterly, Chax Press, and The University

someone said BRIGGFLATTS , by Basil Bunting is a serial poem; I don't think so.

   " Robin Blaser once said in talking about a serial poem that it's as if

you go into a room, a dark room, the light is turned on for a minute, then

it's turned off again, and then you go into a different room where a light

is turned on and turned off."


        - Jack Spicer, From the Vancouver Lectures


I don't know, someone might have posted this Spicer quote already, I

haven't read them all. Ted Berrigan's SONNETS has always seemed to me

a Definitive serial poem. Somehow, maybe from Ted I have the notion

that certain lines repeating throughout the work at various intervals

is integral or at least helpful to, for a serial poem.

Sad news indeed, Charles, thanks for the sad news. I was just reading Tarkos's one English translation book, MA LANGUE EST POETIQUE by Roof Press

and returned it to the library. Terrific writer, 40 years old, sad news.

This is untrue and you know it. You do not add any examples or instances
to back up your assertion, but, conveniently move on as if your
assertion was a well-known axiom, which is unfortunate for the more
ignorant people out there. Please provide an example of where 'they' (of
the 'us'-and-'them' variety) indicate that GWB and actions etc. are 'the
way God wants the world to be'. This is an absurd statement and a
grotesque caricature. (Any support coming from Christians is support for
his Christianity, not his actions.)

There isn't, (as I have previously indicated), any Christian faith which
endorses any sort of divine inspiration -- that's an Old
Testament/Zionist-type thing. I'm sorry Joe, but you are fueling the
'Way-That-God-Wants-The-World-To-Be' fire yourself out of a preference
to avoid above-board issues (oil) and an agenda(?) to attack an entire
faith or cultural-group. Your statement is no more accurate than
claiming all Islam-followers are terrorists and haters of Americans.


..|  IS any "pure" christian doctrine as such, untainted
..|  by centuries of interpretation and power plays

The Christian message is so simple that it cannot be tainted even though
many have tried. There is nothing to taint: no long lists of 'rules'
etc. to follow. There is just simple piety.


..|  and if you don't mind, w/o parsing my post

I merely quote exactly what you have said and then respond in context. I
agree that bringing light to bear on one's own argument can be somewhat
unsettling and that you prefer things left in a lump and unexamined.
Sorry. I am too young to go through a hand-holding/letter-writing
conciliation process which caters to egos at the expense of any
meaningful exchange. Try and bear it. I bear your useless quoting of
entire passages and email addresses.


..|  maybe i could figure out
..|  what your agenda is

I have no agenda, Joe. I am simply correcting what I understand are
inaccuracies as I discover them. I hope the agenda of everyone on the
list, and the list itself, is to accurately reflect the subjects they
make claims about so that the list is not some particular group's (or
person's) tool for propaganda. It would be difficult not to notice a
pronounced hatred for certain cultures on this list tho, and that is a
bad sign for everybody.

derek, ysee, there's just no point in pursuing this topic with
you---or, i daresay, any  topic... i knew it was foolish to try, but
i figured, what the hell...

so i'll stop here, b/c you've proven yourself, as i read you,
entirely incapable of hearing what's being said to you---by ANYONE...
of course i could mount a mountain of evidence in support of what
i've alleged, as well as evidence showing that not all christians are
true believing fundamentalists who would have the u.s. attack the
presumed infidel nations (which latter would not negate the
former)... but you would doubtless receive this as an attack on your
"faith" or some such...

in any case, as i say, there's just no point in pursuing this
further... and for what it's worth, even if your wish were simply to
convince me that what you have to say has value, that would
constitute an agenda... maybe you oughtta think about what it is
you're trying to accomplish on this list, yknow?...

but whatever you decide, that's your biz, 'cause i'm outta here... we
can save each other some trouble by hitting <delete> whenever the
other's name crosses our screens---that's what i'll be doing, anyway,
starting 123 NOW...

Can I believe my ears, but ...

What about Saul of Tarsus?

The hatchetman of the sanhedrin bloody *controlled* what got into the
Judeo-Christian gospels.

There's a tale told (still around) of a young minister preaching for a kirk
in the Isles ...

        "He'll nae get the charge, son -- he's preaching frae the Gospels,
nae frae Paul."

Mibee things would have been different if James-the-brother-of-Jesus had won
that particular fight, ever so long ago.

        Who knows?

This is so silly as almost not to require comment. But ok, I rise to a bit
of antisemitic provocation. Jews don't slaughter Palestineans, Israelis do.
While most Israelis are Jews it's not the same thing. And of course an
awful lot of Jewish Israelis oppose the slaughter. As do most non-Israeli Jews.

Among Jews in the settlements most are there for the cheap, subsidized
housing--Israeli housing elsewhere is among the most expensive on earth. A
minority of settlers are there out of a conviction that they're fighting
for biblical Judea and Samaria.

As to all that independent Christian thought, I'm not sure which world you
live in. Theologians and lay people can theologize all they want, but the
churches of almost all Christrian sects are arranged as franchises, with
ordination a job qualification for the ministry or priesthood and
ordination granted, following a prescribed course of study at a church-run
seminary, or revoked by the central body. The recent defrocking and loss of
position of a lesbian minister (I forget which denomination, but it's a
common enough event) is a case in point--her congregants still wanted her
as minister but she's off the altar and pulpit, because corporate
headquarters defined christian behavior in ways that left her out. No appeal.

I'm aware that in a few denominations ministry is entirely a matter of
election by the congregants, but it's a small minority.

It's not easy discussing this with someone who believes in 1. an
anthropomorphic deity 2. who had a mortal son 3. by a virgin, and 4. that
we live in a story that not only has an end, but an end that we know,
because we flipped to the back of the book a long time ago.

For those of you in the Seattle or Portland, OR area:

Come to a celebration and reading of A*hole by Hilton Obenzinger along with=
=20
Richard Melo, author of Jokerman 8
at Elliott Bay, Seattle, 7:30 PM, Weds., Dec. 8
at Laughing Horse, Portland, 7:30 PM, Thurs., Dec. 9.


A*hole

*a novel by Hilton Obenzinger

(Soft Skull Press)


With A*HOLE, Hilton Obenzinger has created an experimental fiction readers=
=20
will experience as much as read. He draws from sources as varied as Dante,=
=20
Mark Twain, the Patty Hearst story, the Biblical story of Abraham & Isaac,=
=20
Melville's Ishmael, detective fiction, his own experiences as a father and=
=20
a teacher on Yurok Indian reservation, Hollywood, the porn industry and=20
more, which he swirls together around the vortex created by the pull of his=
=20
central hole.

A young boy wakes one morning to discover he is sinking into the earth=20
despite the new sneakers his parents promised would save him. A young woman=
=20
begins reviewing films before they are made. A postal worker named Gary=20
fulfills his occupational clich=E9 and attacks Danny DeVito. A father writes=
=20
letters to his wayward and far-flung sons. An archeologist finds evidence,=
=20
perhaps, of the permanence of time as well as earth. A detective accepts a=
=20
case requiring him to connect Patty Hearst to her other self. Though the=20
story in A*HOLE is in continual flux, Obenzinger skillfully braids the=20
multiple narrative threads into a novel which is much larger than its=20
physical size, lyrically beautiful, and absorbing through and through.

"Hilton Obenzinger is an American original. His lost histories are acts of=
=20
legerdemain and cunning mixing truth and imagination in ways rarely seen=20
before."  Paul Auster

I have always like Robin Blazer's description of writing a serial poem as
similar to meandering through a dark house in which one flips the light
switch in each room to find what's revealed. That was in an interview the
location of which I forget. However, I like Blazer's sense of adventure
about the process, a poem as a sequential journey with prefixed
determinations, and the excitement in which one's language may provide a
series of revelations.
As a critical point from which to start a work, the serial poem was a
boundary breaker - a prison release - for many of us and an entirely
liberating way to write. Ironically much of whatever considers itself the
poetry establishment- (primarily those poetry magazines that remain
committed to publishing those well framed containers called "poems" still
have - after 50 years!- not figured out away to reflect this break.

Raza Youth Conference: Educate!  Donâ€™t Incarcerate!
December 11, 2004
12 Noon to 4 PM

Corner of 41St and Market St.

INTRODUCTION

Since its founding in 1987 (as a project of Union del Barrio) Somos Raza
has
organized Chicano Studies/Raza Studies Programs in throughout the
barrios of
San Diego.  This has been central to our efforts  to implement the
proposals/objectives found in the Plan de Santa Barbara (MEChA) and
founding statements of
the National Association of Chicano/a Studies (NACCS).

This yearâ€™s Raza Youth Conference is being organized collectively with the
Raza Studies Fall 2004 Program. Both Somos Raza and students of the Raza
Studies
Program are organizing the conference.

The Raza Youth Conference is one of the few youth events that truly
advocates
for the self-determination and liberation of La Raza and works to raise the
social-political consciousness of Raza youth.  Those working on the
conference

Selah. Obviously I can't have discussion with someone who's written
themselves off. Nevertheless, it should be patently obvious to all that
the majority of people and/or Christians in the United States are *not*
hoodwinked and haven't become brain-washed or whatever. This conceit
that you, Joe, have a privileged view of society and know better than
most is not a good foundation to build upon. Plugging your ears and
singing tra-la-la doesn't help much either. People voted Bush back in
office for their own selfish reasons (largely found at the gas-pump),
not out of some voodoo spell that's been cast upon them. And any similar
assertion that Bush went into Iraq under divine command is hogwash --
there are no divine commands possible in Christianity (the whole point
of faith). This is my point and it is not unreasonable to make. Your
theatrics are unnecessary.


Robin wrote:
..|  The hatchetman of the sanhedrin
..|  bloody *controlled* what got into

What 'got into' the Old Testament was a decision made by Jewish
high-priests. The New Testament cannon was collected long after Paul's
death. I don't see the connection you are making here. Someone else
chose Paul's letters to be canonized, not Paul.


..|  Can I believe my ears, but ...
..|  What about Saul of Tarsus?

I guess Robin you are suggesting Paul's/Saul's murderous past (killing
Christians for the Jewish court) makes any assertion that the Christian
message could be untainted impossible. I don't see how the message
becomes tainted by someone's previous actions. Even so, Christianity is
exclusively for sinners and is of no use to perfect human beings.


Mark wrote:
..|  she's off the altar and pulpit, because
..|  corporate headquarters defined christian
..|  behavior in ways that left her out. No appeal

I would suggest it was time for her church to leave the franchise and
become non-denominational! If her congregants support her they can
easily do this and, if not, she can find work at other churches where
there is a more tolerant atmosphere. Either way, her 'corporate
headquarters' made a democratic Board decision which she and her
congregants submitted to when they became a franchise. What's more
democratic than that? She lives in America and can freely chose to do
any number of things now that her lousy church headquarters gave her the
boot. What are you crying about (and which world do you live in )?
People lose their jobs everyday because of unjust decisions
made-from-above. The real question is how long will people support these
corrupt systems by endorsing them and submitting themselves to them (ie.
by voting, participating, paying taxes, etc.)? Selah. Every American has
the right to be a sucker.

The bottom-line is that Christian churches are nowhere perfectly run or
without the same human prejudices you would find anywhere. I simply
remind people that Christians are not this evil brain-washing monster
some on this list enjoy making them out to be. They are your next door
neighbors and your fellow citizens and exist all over the world with the
same tendencies, weakness, and goodness that is available to all people.
My main point was to debunk an absurd axiom which painted all Christians
into a rigid non-democratic cult of follow-the-leader. You would 1. have
to be grossly ignorant to believe that is true or 2. just enjoy
bad-mouthing Christians and/or religious-faith in general.

Christians are everyday people in America. They vote Democratic and
Republican and Independent and even don't vote at all (especially in
Utah). Making wild and negative generalizations about religious groups
in general is not productive and, as this particular generalization has
it, completely wrong.

I thought a serial poem had to be 3 lines in length or two sentences,
which ever comes first. And also that if the poem quotes another for
more than four lines it must be indented ten spaces. Topic sentences are
required of stanzas whose authors are narrative poets, which east coast
poets often mis-name lyric poets for a reason I still do not
understand.  Gloria, don't forget to add Weiners to your serial and the
Dunciad also.


By the way, a selected version of the first ten years of my life long
serial piece appears in my book : _In It What's in It_ from Spuyten
Duyvil.

That book by Keller - I only looked at it a bit - but she writes well -is
includes a study of du Plessis and Darragh (and their interaction their
respective projects  (or serial poems) - and she connects them both to
Duncan.

Blazer's description ) (of a so-called serial poem) is quite beautiful.  But
no one has very clearly defined what a serial poem is (except for the Blaser
definition which is excellent for now ) we are talking about Blaser-serial
poems  (well I am now) - a poem that was 'continuous' - well one obvious
example seems to be Alan's huge "work" but unless the serial is one that
comes daily - with a break of 20 hours or so it seems to be more of a
(theoretically at least -a single work) so it is not thus a serial work (in
the Blaser sense) whereas my "Chains" I feel is a true serial work in that
sense.  (Not that it matters what it is!!)

What I did (suggestion of a friend) was to choose a word or phrase and then
think or read  on that (phrase or word) over quite a time and then respond;
or respond immediately to it and write a 'reply' - the method was to link
each poem by a word or an association

Thus for example, in one - in which I quoted a line from Chaucer - I stopped
and read one of the Chaucer tales (in Middle English)  and listened to it on
tape, until finally selecting a single line from the whole poem by Chaucer -
whereas some others I just wrote down 'the answer' immediately:  the point
is that the connections are not very 'logical' and thus each "room"  is a
'surprise (the light going on)  - each "stanza" (which comes from the word
for room of course) - is in a different style and or uses a mix of sound and
my own languages/writings - thus I hope getting an interesting/surprising
mix and a disjunctiveness which is not so much present in say Pound or even
Zukofsky (there is too much of a similarity of tone in both the Cantos and
'A'

- du Plessis ( in her works - forget the name of her long (ongoing -not
continuous and in more or less seamless) work)) is maybe more a Blaser
serial poem. I might  send some of Chains to see if people think it is a
serial poem - or whatever.  If the serial poem is too constructed or
lanned  - key word "too"  - it fails the Blaser criteria. The poet needs not
to know how the poem -starting at A is going to be at M or R or Z or whether
he or she keeps going for ever - that cant be known - I suspect that Alan's
work - mystifying as it is - is too constructed to be a Blaser-Serial-Taylor
Poem.

{taken} to its great extreme the BSTP is totally unrecogisable apart from
part to part in its style and tone etc  - - so a good example would be to
start with a quote from the Koran - then a quote from Penthouse would be say
part 2 and so on...but it couldnt continue to be quotes from -it would have
to surprise totally thus be completely random (or pseudo random) - going the
appearnce orf  a near chaotic and meaningles work  - but fascinating - the
import and direction of which the author has no knwoledge o or control (or
very little).... ..also numeration absent or order plicable  (as in B S
Jonston's novel in a box...) (and aim ofr meaninglesness..or near
meaningfullness -(slight meaning)

Clearly R Silliman's "Alphabet" (brilliant as it is) is too modernistically
deterministic to qualify......

IN fact - very few of the examples so-far proffered fit the
Blaser-Taylor-Serial-Poem-Criteria (or the  parameters thus implied......

I too have been troubled by some of what Derek says in his defense of
Christianity in this thread because--while his point about not lumping all
Christians, evangelical or otherwise, into one group--is well taken, his
rhetoric when he talks about the purity and simplicity of the Christian
message and about the dichotomy between works-based and faith-based
religions resembles all too closely the kinds of things I have heard over
the years from the myriad of evangelical Christians who have tried very,
very, very hard to convert me by persuading me that their version of
Christianity is somehow purer and closer to God and therefore more real and
authentic than Judaism. Some of what he says--particularly about the faith
vs. works and about the Hebrew Bible having been canonized not by Jewish
high priests (they were actually the scholars and teachers of their time; it
is an important difference)--resembles as well anti-Semitic canards that
date back at least to the Middle Ages. And I would point out that his
assertion that "Jews...slaughter Palestinians because they believe God told
them expressly to do so" is unambiguously and expressly anti-Semitic.

Now, I don't know Derek; I don't know that he would endorse proselytizing--a
practice that, it seems to me, any Christian seriously committed to true
respect for the validity of other religious traditions needs to oppose--nor
am I suggesting that he is himself, consciously, maliciously, willfully
anti-Semitic. (I am willing to accept the comment about Jews slaughtering
Palestinians may have been written as an angry and ironic comment--not that
this makes the comment less anti-Semitic, just that I am willing to give
Derek the benefit of the doubt, for now.) But it is important to me to point
this out. Derek might not have "appreciated" being called anti-Semitic, as
he said in the parenthetical end to one of his recent posts, but if that is
the case, then he needs to take responsibility for the rhetoric he uses and
the underlying assumptions it contains. If he doesn't endorse those
assumptions, he should not endorse the rhetoric.

I was thinking specifically of the New Testament (thus "gospels").

While the construction of the New Testament canon post-dates Paul (few of
the letters under his name in the NT actually being written by him, but
that's another matter) the locus of the selection derived from Paul's
seizure of control of the early Church.  James actually *knew*/was related
to Jesus, Paul didn't and wasn't.  James saw the Christian message as
specifically directed at the Jews, Paul was into outreach towards the
Greeks.

Whether this is a good or a bad thing could be argued -- simply, Paul won,
and that's the consequence we have to live with.

I have to admit that Paul isn't one of my favourite people, but that wasn't
my central point.  What we have (and have had since about 100 AD) isn't
Christianity but *Pauline* Christianity.  There's always been a tension in
Christianity between the Gospels (and within them), and "Paul" (using that
term as an heteronym for the Epistles) with the more rigid versions of
Christianity, from (at least) Augustine to Luther and Calvin drawing on
"Paul" rather than the Gospels.

I think what mostly bothers me is Derek's image of an untainted a-historic
version of Christianity.  At the most basic level, the gospels as we have
them present Jesus speaking in Greek, whereas he almost certainly preached
in Aramaic.  So there's already a level of "translation" there.

I think (and this is perhaps more arguable) that the original preachings of
Jesus were directed specifically at the Jewish society of which he was a
part, and that the Pauline attempt (all too successful) to export this to
Greece and Rome created a set of singular contradictions.  It's the old
guilt culture / shame culture business -- in order to forgive the Greeks
their sins, Paul first of all had to make then *feel* guilty.

... and it's that legacy, willy nilly, believers or not, that we still have
to live with.

Does he ever look back at the music he's written with surprise?

"I used to. I don't do that anymore. I don't know how I got to write those
songs. Those early songs were almost magically written," says Dylan, who quotes
from his 1964 classic, "It's Alright, Ma."

"Try to sit down and write something like that. There's a magic to that, and
it's not Siegfried and Roy kind of magic, you know? It's a different kind of a
penetrating magic. And, you know, I did it. I did it at one time."

What does the word "destiny" mean to Dylan?

"It's a feeling you have that you know something about yourself - nobody else
does - the picture you have in your mind of what you're about will come true,"
says Dylan. "It's kind of a thing you kind of have to keep to your own self,
because it's a fragile feeling. And if you put it out there, somebody will kill
it. So, it's best to keep that all inside."

Grete immediately ran out to Hans and shouted "Hans, we're free! The old
witch is dead!". They danced of joy and embraced each other. They went
through the house and found a lot of pearls and jewelry. The two children
laughed and collected all the treasure they could carry. So at least we
know that under capitalism there are treasures and people that own them.
And we know who they are too. So we could kill them and take their
treasures. The witch wanted to eat Hans and Grete. We know capitalism
wants to exploit us until death. After that, they ran home and embraced
their father, his wife was now dead, but their worries were now over. Was
logos married to the witch? Why did she want to eat her children? Greed
is the mother. Ignorance is the father logos. Hans and Grete had to fix
their own situation, their father didn't care, their mother was a witch.

Early the cold morning the little girl sat in the corner between the two
houses. Her cheeks were red and she had smile on her lips. She was dead.
She had frozen to death on New Year's Eve. Day and night, warm and cold,
the burning sun, burning matches. Why should the earth revolve? Little
carousel. End of the cycle. If you ride on a beam of light. Dark sun at
the center of the cycle - her grandmother. We already know her parents
were ignorance and greed, day and night. Before day and night is
space - between the houses. The grandmother took the little girl in
her arms, and together they flew away in shining joy, higher and higher
until there were no more cold, hunger or suffering. Matter shapes space,
and space shapes trajectory of matter. That's why the grandmother
(matter) could take the little girl (matter), and use the parent
generation as a carrier wave (space). Dark sun grandmother, little light
beam. Higher and higher gravity and speed until everything is lost.
Before and after the world. Day and night is our world, our parents,
father ignorance and mother greed, darkness of logos, neediness of
fullness.

What father does is right, and everything goes well in the end. His
ignorance in trading a horse into a sack of apples is only surpassed by
his wife's blind love. But everything works out in the end because the
story is utterly unbelievable.

Beauty and the beast. In the first place, the father set out to sea to
get rich. Apparently there were no mother since beauty did all the
housework. The beast of incestuous shame. Father trades her to the beast
and goes free. The castle is empty and crypted, father sad and impotent.
Once beauty acknowledges the beast it turns into a prince, that's art,
ugly beauty, too close to marry. Art has no mother, only an incestuous
father - ignorant, displaced greed, really ugly and impossible.

Put better than I could have, Murat.  I think Bill has abandoned the term "serious," which somehow delegitimated both Robert Burns and Bob Dylan, whom no history of anglophone art can be written or understood.

that said, some artistic pursuits require more funding than others.   i agree though that writers should no longer get fellowships from the NEA, particularly if they are tenured.

Bill,

Sorry for answering late. I was away from any convenient computer access for
a week.

I still do not understand this distinction between serious and other works.
To me, why this narrow definition of serious. Rap, for instance, has had a
profound influence in the music of The Middle East, not as imitation but a fusion
of local forms with its rhythms. It has extanded a popular/political language.
It is thrilling, for instance, to hear a Turkish techno sound, built on
Turkish chords, etc., suddenly echoing Rap rhythms. Gary Sullivan has talked
about it in his blog at length.

Why define innovative in terms of purely Western/American terms of the last
fifty years?

WORKSHOP THIS SATURDAY

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff
Final workshop of the season.
December 11, 12 p.m. - 4 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

The Art and Craft of Creative Nonfiction
December 11

Participants will learn how to take a "a scenic approach" to creative
writing. There will be some writing exercises that attendees will use as
building blocks to a longer essay, which will be due by Dec. 27 in order for
the student to receive an evaluation. During the session, a particular idea
will be developed and we will work on what the essay should contain,
including the use of description strategies that produce vivid imagery,
descriptive language that will reinforce overall impressions of subjects, as
well as comparisons that take the form of similes and metaphors.  For those
really interested in learning how to write and submit creative nonfiction,
this workshop will show how to write a dramatic, true story using scenes,
dialogue, close detailed descriptions and other techniques usually employed
by poets and fiction writers as well as professional journalists.

Kathryn Radeff has been a professional writer, teacher and mentor helping
writers achieve success for 24 years. Her essays, creative nonfiction,
interviews, profiles and feature articles have appeared in Woman's World,
Instructor, The Buffalo News, Buffalo Magazine, Reader's Digest, Buffalo
Spree, The Tampa Tribune, Miami Herald, Daytona Beach News Journal, American
Health, Writer's Journal and many other publications.

  Akin to the urgency, precision, and agility of a liberating foot
solider, Sulaiman's narratives broadcast from America's front lines
defining a Black, Shi'i, Muslim's quest for tranquility. His latest opus
Dead Man Walking seeks to remedy the general apathy of his generation
and awaken hibernating souls. "As a young Muslim Black male in America I
feel under attack on many fronts. I can handle being under attack, but
it's heartbreaking - at times-- to feel as though I have no comrades.
Everyone seems oblivious to our war against the Prison Industrial
Complex, police, drugs, poverty and the list goes on.  And if they are
not oblivious then their concern does not spur them to action.  So much
of the album is born out of frustration and desperation. I hope to tear
back the comforter of apathy and make us own up to ourselves and our
responsibility to our people."  An ambitious offering, Dean Man Walking
is tailored for those who prefer virtue to vice. It's a treasure for
those who are trying desperately to live, love, and pursue happiness.

A native of Rochester, New York, writer, activist, and educator Amir
Sulaiman is a member of Goodestuff Entertainment, an Atlanta based
collective providing culturally relevant programming.  With a political
consciousness that is profound without being preachy...

Mindsets are interesting. Growing up with literature as something that =
comes on paper, when a new medium comes along, some people =
(organizations are made of people) can't adjust. With organizations that =
help artists, this is very sad. Here, for example, we have a politically =
progressive city (72% of Portlanders voted against Bush) who doesn't =
help progressive artists.

Hi Joel:
Thanks for your note. Literary Arts does support writers who are =
e-published: an electronically published book can be printed and =
submitted for the Oregon Book Awards; a writer can submit his/her work =
in manuscript form for the Oregon Literary Fellowships. "Experimental" =
writers (I'm not necessarily sure I know what you mean when you say =
this) are welcome to submit their work.

As far as artists who combine writing and digital media, i.e hypertext =
etc.--that Literary Arts does not consider. Because we are focused as an =
organization on words, to get into digital images and Flash-based =
computer programming is considered outside our mission.=20

Take care!

Sincerely,
Kristy

would hope that Literary Arts would be ready to offer support to =
Oregon's writers who in a field that has more readership than do books.

  I'd also like to see a category for experimental writing, which is the =

Yeesh is right. First of all, let's get this whole case of paranoia into
context:

    Joel wrote:
    ....|  Bush's divine inspiration to invade Iraq

    Derek replied [among other arguments]:
    ..|  Save your divine commandments for Jews
    ..|  to slaughter untold Palestinians because
    ..|  they believe God told them expressly to
    ..|  do so. There are no divine inspirations in
    ..|  Christianity (Gal.1:8) and this is made
    ..|  abundantly clear


Now, this is a sterile dispute. What I have said above was only to
demonstrate divine commands are not in the providence of Christianity,
but, I unfortunately added (in a tongue-in-cheek fashion) divine
commands are a trademark of the Jewish Torah. Any claim against my reply
is a claim against what is unambiguously and expressly presented in the
Torah:

Genesis 15:18-21
    In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto
thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great
river, the river Euphrates: The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the
Kadmonites, And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, And
the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the
Jebusites.

Joshua 1:3-4
    Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I
given unto you, as I said unto Moses. From the wilderness and this
Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of
the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun,
shall be your coast.


Now, no one likes to be called an anti-Semite, and no one should be
called an anti-Semite who is not one. And it makes even less sense to
call the Torah anti-Semitic. And, as an axiom, nobody should claim the
authority to dictate to people what and how to think under the threat of
anti-Semitic labeling.

These hypersensitive and *predatory* responses are atrocious. We should
be able to freely and civilly debate on this list without fear of
persecution. You are over-reacting. Where were you when Alan made the
recent claim that he hated all Christians? And why are you here now
dishing out the morality when no hate claim has been made, intended, or
demonstrated? Shameful.

        -- Derek

 it would be the truth." -- Morpheus

You got the same response from a number of people, all of whom you say
misunderstood you, which means we all read badly or we were responding to
how you expressed yourself. This is a poets' list, and it's reasonable to
assume a modicum of sensitivity to what one's words convey or might convey.
Take it under advisement.

Logic that one could only call Jesuitical ("any claim against my reply is a
claim against...", usw) doesn't make this go away.

Before you reply re: jesuitical--look it up.

Actually, Derek, I did not write that your paraphrase of the Torah was
anti-Semitic, what I wrote is that your interpretive statement--nowhere in
the Biblical verses that you quote does it say anything about God commanding
any sort of killing whatsoever--to the effect that the Jews believe God
commanded us to kill untold Palestinians was anti-Semitic. And I did not
call you personally anti-Semitic; I said you were using rhetoric that cannot
help, to me, but have an anti-Semitic subtext, and that is precisely what I
meant. Believe me if I wanted to level a charge of anti-Semitism at you
personally, I would have no hesitation about doing so, but I don't know you
and I don't know enough about you to know whether I should even consider
such a thing. There is a big difference between the two characterizations I
have just described, but if you insist on taking what I wrote personally
then, yes, you are right: this is a sterile dialogue, and there is no point
in continuing it.

Yeesh is right. First of all, let's get this whole case of paranoia into
context:

    Joel wrote:
    ....|  Bush's divine inspiration to invade Iraq

    Derek replied [among other arguments]:

    ..|  abundantly clear


Now, this is a sterile dispute. What I have said above was only to
demonstrate divine commands are not in the providence of Christianity,
but, I unfortunately added (in a tongue-in-cheek fashion) divine
commands are a trademark of the Jewish Torah. Any claim against my reply
is a claim against what is unambiguously and expressly presented in the
Torah:

Genesis 15:18-21
    In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto
thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great
river, the river Euphrates: The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the
Kadmonites, And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, And
the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the
Jebusites.

Joshua 1:3-4
    Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I
given unto you, as I said unto Moses. From the wilderness and this
Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of
the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun,
shall be your coast.


Now, no one likes to be called an anti-Semite, and no one should be
called an anti-Semite who is not one. And it makes even less sense to
call the Torah anti-Semitic. And, as an axiom, nobody should claim the
authority to dictate to people what and how to think under the threat of
anti-Semitic labeling.

These hypersensitive and *predatory* responses are atrocious. We should
be able to freely and civilly debate on this list without fear of
persecution. You are over-reacting. Where were you when Alan made the
recent claim that he hated all Christians? And why are you here now
dishing out the morality when no hate claim has been made, intended, or
demonstrated? Shameful.

For me, the humor is that monotheists always quote their favorite book for
authority. "Genesis, Joshua..." If we need a God, we need one who speaks in
and to the contemporary world, not in books from two thousand or more years
ago, translated and retranslated. This adds nothing to the discussion but
endless arguments and accusations, which is what we have here now. Sell your
Bible, Talmud, Koran, and buy poetry!

the sun is weak
this ohio december
a tired yellow
in a  nearly gray sky
can't get it up for me
warm it up for me
like back in  October

pond
then
rising with his juicy  sustenance
but it's too late now
and he wings from tree to tree
eyeing  the cold little abyss
rattling his dry raspy chatter
tho patient
flies away hungry . . .

for the halcyon as it  plummets
from such a high place

a  female kingfisher
that dived into a lake

her mate frantic circling above . . .
i get up from my  bench

covering ground some green  grass
some leaves and twigs
and mud not quite frozen
the pond is  covered with blotches of thin ice . . .
i have a soft pale belly
places  warm and juicy
covered now by jeans and a jacket
my sundresses and straw  hat
packed away for next summer
i walk carefully with my cane
eleven  winters now
and as i pass through the park gates
i dream of the coming  spring

I liked this poem.

I see the odd kingfisher over here in Auckland - they are quite common here.
Beautiful birds.

I have been reading posts on this listserv and at other sites ever since the
election with a growing impulse to respond.  What I have to say is, firstly,
idiosyncratic--I speak, of course, only from my own experience--and in some
limited way has to do with an interest in speaking on behalf of the very
contested community of Christians.  At this point, saying that I'm a Christian
seems about as meaningful as saying that I am liberal or avant garde, or
whatever: all terms deflated of real meaning.  However, I went to seminary,
worked as a hospital chaplain and as a college chaplain, and lived in an
intentional community of African American Christians.  I suppose that makes me
in some sense a "Christian expert."  The people that I encountered in all of
those venues disagreed significantly about what it means to be a Christian and
what it means to have faith and how to enact it.  This is something that we
discussed endlessly.  I am well aware that there are some churches and
communities in which this kind of discussion would be closed down, especially
if conducted by women.

      I have been reading reading recent posts here and elsewhere, especially
after the election, with a growing sense that I'd like to respond.  I am
speaking idiosyncratically, on the basis of my own experience.  At the same
time, I am aware that I am a part of a very contested community and that I'd
like to represent that community differently than is typically done in a forum
like this.  So: I went to seminary, worked in Oklahoma (this is significant)
as a college chaplain, worked as a hospital chaplain, and lived in an
intentional Christian urban community whose African American facilitators were
working on civil rights issues.  I suppose this makes me a Christian expert of
sorts.  My experience is that Christianity is anything but monolithic.  All of
the groups I have been involved with disagreed on many things and discussed
these differences endlessly.  I am well aware that in some Christian
communities these discussions would be closed down, especially if they were
conducted by women.  At the same time, I don't know personally any Christian
people who voted for Bush, and I do know a lot of Christian people who worked
very hard to thwart his reelection.
     All of this will, I hope, seem obvious to those who read it.  I think it
bears explicit statement because my experience with poets (with whom I've had
affiliation for as long as I've had affiliation with Christians) has been that
conversations on this matter can be reductive and even irresponsible.  Sample
a few comments that poets have made to me without any apparent sense that they
were inappropriate:
"Oh, you're a Christian--you're intellectual deadwood."
"I can't believe that you'd admit you're a Christian; that's like telling
people that you're a smoker."
"You'll want to talk to so and so; she believes in God too."
"Well, I knew you were a Christian, but what surprises me is that
you seem actually to be kind of smart."
"Saying that you're a lyric poet is almost as bad as saying you're a
Christian."
Okay, I admit that some of these are kind of funny, but they weren't INTENDED
to be.  What's surprised me even more is that it has sometimes been hard for
me to get a job because my c.v. reflects my religious involvements.  At my
current place of employment, there was open discussion that I shouldn't be
hired because of my religious affiliation. I can't imagine that such a
discussion would ensue at a state run, politically liberal institution if the
applicant were Hindu, Muslim,Jewish, or Buddhist.
     I realize that my comments here are anecdotal. Some of the comments on
this thread have been pretty interesting and nuanced, and I'm happy to enter
into religious hermeneutics with others. But some of the comments are, at
best, poorly informed and irresponsible.  My request: rather than telling me
who I am and what I think, that an inquiry be made.  I have been very
interested in Joan Retallack's idea of the conceptual swerve, in which the
unexpected can emerge and reshape ossified conceptual constructs.  Why can't a
faith inquiry function similarly?  Why can't chance be an operative part of
faith?  I certainly don't subscribe to the idea that
faith is a process in which there can be "no diversity of opinion,compromise"
otherwise it would hold no interest for me.  Faith and art-making seem
analogous in the sense that both involve being curious, making inquiry, and
taking certain risks.  "To take something on faith," to my reading means
NOT having certainty of outcome but pursuing it anyway because it is somehow
compelling and might lead to further engagement and exploration.

Elizabeth:

Thanks for this. As you quoted me, "To take something on faith," I should
reply. You see faith as meaning  "NOT having certainty of outcome but
pursuing it anyway because it is somehow compelling and might lead to
further engagement and exploration." This turns it on its head. It's a
creative, but fruitless way of reading it. Of course you're right, I think,
that there's no "certainty of outcome," but people who take things on faith
do not ask questions. In fact, this ploy, which the Catholic Church uses to
stop inquiry. It's political equivalent is  "my country right or wrong."

Of course there are progressive Christians, but I'm addressing the people
who voted for Bush, on "moral" grounds. The evangelical faith-based movement
in Christianity, which is still fighting the evidence of evolution, a
woman's right to make decision about her own body, minority rights, etc., is
America's Taliban, and is dangerous to the future of whatever democracy we
have left. I'm sure progressive Christians hate this corruption of their
religion even more than non-Christians. But, after being a member of a
theistic society this my whole life, and given the failed history of
monotheism, all the people who have died and who have been killed in its
name, something that continues today in Iraq and the Middle East, it's
obvious to me that this path hasn't solved any basic human problems, but
only makes them worse. We've had five thousand years to see this. That's why
I suggest that if we need a God, we need one who speaks to us now, and not
in books that speak to another time. This is what creativity is about. This
is why we need poets.

Penis Tree: Fertility Symbol or Political Poster?
 Dec 7, 10:22 AM (ET)
By Gideon Long

LONDON (Reuters) - At first glance, the Massa Marittima mural looks
fairly similar to dozens of other medieval frescoes dotted across
Tuscany.

But look closely at the spidery tree that dominates the center of the
painting and you notice something peculiar. Its branches are covered
in penises.

There are 25 of them in all, of different shapes and sizes, complete
with testicles. They hang from the limbs of the tree like leaves
fluttering in the breeze.

The mural dates from the 13th century and is still visible on a wall
in the Italian town of Massa Marittima where it was discovered during
renovation work four years ago.

Dear Derek,

It is not JEWS killing Palastinians. Please direct your anger at a certain
portion of Israel. Jews and Israelis are not the same thing. There are ugly
zionist games afoot and it is a shame that some of my family are involved in
such things. However, none of the games are directed at you. No one called
you anti-Semitic, only your remark. And as you continue to flagellate the
issue, should we begin to wonder??

My, my, it seems that in the latest installment of his
ongoing "Imitatio Christi," Mr. Rogerson has donned his crown of
thorns with a vengeance, calling upon helicopter gunships to unleash
all available firepower against his (thankfully strictly verbal)
brimstone.  Though martyrdom may not be too far from Mr. Rogerson's
fervid dreams, as for quite a while now he has been trying to convince
us that he, as a Christian, is by mere virtue of that choice of
monotheisms among the insulted, injured, and persecuted of the world,
valiantly wielding his rhetorical popguns against the atheist (or
Jewish) onslaught, let me just say that it is obscene to see anyone
anywhere use the oppression of Palestinians as a bloody flag to score
a couple of points in the utterly safe context of an online argument.
Mr. Rogerson, be informed that among the harshest critics of Israel's
reprehensible policies are such poets as Aharon Shabtai and Yitzhak
Laor, activists Gila Svirsky and Uri Avnery, journalist Amira Hass,
historians Ilan Pappe and the late Simha Flapan and Israel Shahak --
all of them Jews who lived or are now living in Israel.  I realize
that, according to Rogerson, "Jews" (how delicate of him to leave out
the definite article) are only interested in "slaughtering untold
Palestinians" (such are the vagaries of ugly Christian games of
wordplay), so maybe none of that matters.  Anything short of "Gloria
in excelsis Derek" is all bullying and blackmail anyway.  Take a
minute to polish that halo though, Derek, you seem to have smeared it
in an unmentionable substance...

But your statement about Jews killing Palestinians because they believe God
commanded them to, Derek, is not about Israel; it is about Jews. If you had
made the statements about the policies of Sharon's government, and/or the
government's that preceded his, and those Jews who support those policies,
some of whom do in fact use the Hebrew Bible as justification for bulldozing
Palestinian homes and maiming and torturing and killing Palestinians, you
and I might have found ourselves agreeing with each other. (I don't know
enough about you to say absolutely that I would agree with you.) The fact
is, however, that you have conflated Israel and those Jews within Israel
whom I just mentioned with all the other Jews in the world and that
conflation is anti-Semitic, though I am still willing to assume that this is
the product not of willful Jew-hatred on your part but rather of your having
fallen into a particular kind of rhetoric that is very easy to fall into. It
is one thing, for example, for Palestinians to say "Jews" when they are
referring to Israelis; in their context, when they talk about what "the
Jews" do to them, it is clear they are talking about the Israelis. Outside
of that context, however, there is no way you can use the word "Jew" and not
also refer to me and to all the other Jews in the world who neither live in
Israel nor support what the Israeli government is doing--not to mention
those Jews who live in Israel and oppose their government's policies. And
this lumping together, which is a habit of speech and mind of people who are
anti-Semitic (something, again, of which I am not accusing you personally),
makes it very difficult for me to get past the surface of what you have said
to the point where we might be able to have a meaningful dialogue. It would
make no sense, I am sure you would agree, to enter into the kind of dialogue
you say you want with someone who appears as if he might hate you simply for
being who you are.

I feel very strongly about what is happening to Palestinians in the Occupied
Territories.  But this statement does read as anti-Semitic.  It is not
"Jews" who commit these crimes.

I agree, one of the very problematic things about this particular conflict
is the misuse of the term "anti-Semitic" as a kneejerk accusation to reject
criticism of the State of Israel.  Disentangling one's own rhetoric from the
rhetoric of racism seems to me, therefore, all the more necessary.

Best

i think the problem is using the word "Jewish" as if all Jewish
people had the same policy toward the Palestinians.  If you used a
phrase like "the Israeli government" you would not be treading near
anti-Semitism.

Just want to say I've lived in Israel and Derek doesn't know what he's
talking about.

But what does this have to do with Poetics?

And you do smack of anti-semitism and I'm not a Zionist.

I agree. But often when one criticizes the Israeli government
one is called an anti-semite.

All discourse on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict tends to be inflected
with anti-Semitism -- often the discourse produced by Zionists themselves
-- and it's a constant struggle to untangle the threads.  George is correct
that Zionists will attack criticisms of Israel as anti-Semitic, and it's
been like this for a long time -- making it very difficult to criticize the
brutal realities of colonialism (who wants to be smeared as an
anti-Semite?).  Recently, for example, student groups have discussed
campaigns to divest universities from companies doing business with Israel
(like the anti-apartheid movement), and they have been criticized by
Harvard President Lawrence Sommers and others for being anti-Semitic (see
Judith Butler's or my own responses).  Now some mainline Christian
denominations (I think Methodists and Presbyterians, but I may not be
remembering correctly) are discussing divestment.  Sommers and the Zionist
organizations are being a bit more circumspect, trying to meet privately
with leaders to head them off, but they launch their "anti-Semitic" attack
any day now.

When Israeli troops and politicians say "We are the Jews," it isn't
surprising that the response is against "the Jews."  I think that the
Zionist movement has, for a long time, tried to confuse the discourse to
make it more difficult to discuss Zionism as a colonialist movement. The
PLO tried for decades to make the distinction between Jews and Zionists,
between Judaism and the State of Israel.  With the emergence of Islamic
parties, this approach is increasingly difficult -- and I think many of the
Israeli government like the reversion to religion (since it makes them seem
Western and democratic in comparison).  So, to hear confusions on this list
is not surprising, I suppose.  I had thought that poets -- who cherish the
nuances of language -- would be at the forefront of making distinctions.

We are seeing similar dynamics in relation to "Americans."  A Stanford
athlete (anti-war) was recently booed by the entire stadium in Scotland at
an international competition when he was identified as American.  No one
asked about his position on the war.

Here are some realities:

There are numerous Israeli Jews and other Jews who are speaking out at the
atrocious behavior of the Israeli government, settlers, etc.

Israel continues to oppress and displace Palestinians despite condemnation
of Geneva conventions, UN, and international courts.

There are numerous Americans who speak out at the atrocious behavior of the
US government.

The US continues its occupation of Iraq and mistreatment of prisoners
despite criticism and condemnation by International Red Cross, and more.

Now what?

Not that this should ever come as a surprise.

If you want to complain about NBC etc refusing to run gay-friendly
advertising from the United Church of Christ, or because O'Reilly is
being homophobic or racist, you'll have to do so under the indecency
section of the FCC complaints form.

It would be good for them to start hearing from the majority of us,

TODD SHIELDS, MEDIA WEEK - In an appearance before Congress in February,
when the controversy over Janet Jackson's Super Bowl moment was at its
height, Federal Communications Commission chairman Michael Powell laid
some startling statistics on U.S. senators. The number of indecency
complaints had soared dramatically to more than 240,000 in the previous
year, Powell said. The figure was up from roughly 14,000 in 2002, and
from fewer than 350 in each of the two previous years. There was, Powell
said, "a dramatic rise in public concern and outrage about what is being
broadcast into their homes." What Powell did not reveal - apparently
because he was unaware - was the source of the complaints. According to
a new FCC estimate obtained by Mediaweek, nearly all indecency
complaints in 2003 - 99.8 percent - were filed by the Parents Television
Council, an activist group. This year, the trend has continued, and
perhaps intensified. . .

The prominent role played by the PTC has raised concerns among critics
of the FCC's crackdown on indecency. "It means that really a tiny
minority with a very focused political agenda is trying to censor
American television and radio," said Jonathan Rintels, president and
executive director of the Center for Creative Voices in Media, an
artists' advocacy group.

"Stag o' Lee and Billy
two men who gambled late
Stag o' Lee threw a  seven
Billy swore he threw an eight"

"Stag o' Lee tol' ol' Billy
I  can't let you go with that
you done won all my money
and my brand new  Stetson hat"

The game is fixed, the dice are loaded, the alley is blind;  oh Jesus, how
presumptuous to feign to be so kind. Oh save me from the man who  wants to do me
good. Throw what you will, the outcome's pre-ordained, Jesus is  the sin, so
gamblers cannot win, and it all begins again. Blood, blood, blood,  is always
running, running, running, just before the rousing light that shakes  us from
this Jesus night out of drunken dreams, out of bitter waste, out of lack  of
purpose: it's the dead-end alley and the canceled ticket. There is no
liberation, just do-overs
and "what was I thinking?" awakenings.

"Stag  o' Lee went to the bar room
and he stood cross the bar room door
said, now  nobody move
and he pulled his forty-four"

"Stag o' Lee, cried  Billy
oh please don't take my life
I got three little children
and a  very sickly wife"

Who liquors up our boys on Messianic nectars, and dares  to leave a free man
only death? What gain for the bartender; paid off in what  Billy has brazenly
stolen? Do not fight the system children, God the mutating  brain infection
must be defended at any cost, and all who
disrespect the  delusion and pay with stolen truth are caught and killed to
save the lie: for  truth cannot be killed, only the mouth of it, only the
scribblings of it, and  then only washed away with ill-shed human blood. So Billy,
neither gambler, nor  thief, ignores the rules of the game and has a drink on
Stag o' Lee, in the  currency of worthless ideas glorified by terrified
children too weak to let him  live.

"Stag o' Lee shot Billy
well he shot that poor boy so  bad
that the bullet went through Billy
and broke the bartenders  glass"

Oh sweet relief, oh that the glass be broken, oh that the ghosts  may laugh
again in green and watered worlds; beyond this noxious nightmare on  Jesus
street. Oh pour no more for me of this walk with thee, for it is not  closer I
long to be, but far far outside the prison you have
made out of the  childish fear of men: to be at length where people can live
free, and stomp that  glass beneath their feet for love of human things.

Oh terror, oh terror,  oh the ranting march of Jesus up and down the USA: but
now surviving natives  build casinos and river boats and wait pragmatically
for the end of the need of  such things. Real life is only truth, and Billy was
no gambler.

Dear Camille,
I understand previous publication of a segment or shorter version of a
book in e-book form as analagous to chapbook publication, i.e., if it is
acceptable to include in a full-length collection all or some of 25
poems previously published as a chapbook, then I would expect that the
same applies to 25 poems published as an e-book.  Many first book
contests "forgive" chapbooks.  Maybe chapbooks are particularly harmless
sorts of publications.  Maybe because of their chappiness.  E-books,
now, are more shark-like.  Not Moby Dick shark-like (that chapter on
precisely how sharks remove head-shaped scoops from the carcass of the
whale) but shiny, glib, sort of *disco* compared to the tweedy lineny
flannelly *chapbook*.  But I feel I am digressing.  The question of what
happens if your whole entire book is first published as an e-book is
another thing.  In that case, I sorta think your whole entire book is
already published, it's an e-book though, no less nor more than its
print sister, but different ....  On the other hand, publishers who
publish e-books (disco-publishers rather than tweedy-publishers) tend be
open-minded run-with-the-times sorts of gals and guys: they mightn't
have a problem handing over the e-book to print publication.
The print guys now, they might see it differently.  It's definitely time
for bed.

Antidotes for an Alibi Poetry by Amy King

Amy King's first full-length collection, Antidotes for an Alibi, insists
that we examine the deceptive clarity of our actions and the goals that
motivate us. How does one actually get from "A" to "B"-and is there ever
really a "B"? What color is the white space between "A" and "B"? Upon closer
inspection, surface realities reveal themselves to be porous and fragile,
layered with textures and grains that lead the eye on varying pathways. So
what are we to do in a world of newspaper narratives that instruct us toward
tidy endings, murmuring that such endings are possible and even inevitable?

Amy King's poems think in association, evoking a world familiar but entirely
unexpectable. Next to us all this turns and spins: under the veil of hum and
drum is the paradise of possibility. This is a poetry of hope for a world
shrouded by nearly and almost. -- Charles Bernstein

I like the way the poems in Antidotes for an Alibi seem to turn on their
axes. Their wit is gone before you know it, but the metaphysical effect
transports you a considerable distance, where you find yourself happy to be
pleasantly addled.
-- Ron Padgett


Amy King's poems leap from small, fragile moments into grand gesture and
godly vision. Her snapshots of downtown folklore connect on the most basic,
truthful level. "If I were you, I would wait for me," King writes. I advise
you to do what she says.

Richard et al,

1. I was not aware the word 'Jew' was a dirty word -- I only used it to
indicate Jewish people (see http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=jew
for my usage)
2. I was not aware of a difference between 'those Jews' and 'other Jews'
when I made my post
3. Everyone is reading a great deal more into what I have happened to
say as an aside to demonstrate 'divine inspiration' than what I was
clearly intending. Given recent events it is clear to me that
Jews/Israelis appear to carry around a tremendous amount of baggage
attached to their ethnicity and the word(s) used to describe it -- and I
don't want to get involved with this stuff (you call yourselves Jews so
I call you the same, like Hilton said)
4. The Jew/Israeli distinction is confusion -- but regardless how
conflated those words are I still had Jews/Israelis attacking me on this
list for no reason I could fathom and I don't like it
5. The violent land-grab that is going on in Israel *is undisputedly*
religiously motivated and should be subject to a great deal of scrutiny.
6. I don't hate anybody, especially Jews, especially anybody
7. It is not unreasonable to indicate that Jews/Israelis (whomever you
want to call this group, you know who I mean -- the people who are
performing these actions), even just some of them, are bulldozing
Palestinian homes and maiming and torturing and killing Palestinians
expressly because of a divine commandment from God (what Joel might call
'divine inspiration') -- so what's the problem with my indication,
especially just to demonstrate 'divine inspiration'?
8. And if there is a problem, the problem can be nicely approached and
calmly explained without every Jew/Israeli (you know who I mean, that
cultural group of people on this list) going ape-shit and throwing all
kinds of hate-filled ad hominem crap in my direction
9. Whatever problem people have with the Jew/Israeli terminology are
problems they carry around themselves. Don't blame me if you have
special meaning for some words I couldn't possibly have known being
outside the group, I am not a Jewish historian, nor do I study Jewish
culture or Jewish politics etc. *(this thread has been a lesson) -- to
me Jewish people 'adhere to Judaism as a religion or culture and/or
identify themselves as Hebrew' and that is not a racial slur that's like
Hindu, Christian, etc.. so I don't know what hell you saying because it
really is conflated, I don't see how an Israeli is not a Jew and I don't
see why anyone would read all kinds of terrible meaning into what I said
other than to use it as cheap fodder to smear my character because they
yearned to do so before anything was said at all
10. I continue to not appreciate people assigning and ascribing
particular religious faiths or beliefs to myself and/or assuming what I
believe religiously -- and I certainly don't appreciate this childish
martyr-mocking bullshit either
11. Can we *finally* acknowledge that there is no Christian magic-spell
controlling the populace and Bush doesn't have 'God' whispering
commandments in-his-ear? That's what this is all about isn't it?

Adios, Derek

Hi Camille,

Most ebooks are published with one time publication rights and then the
rights return to the author. This shouldn't be a deal breaker to a print
publisher, although there are fuddy-duddies out there ... this should be
seen as a plus. This shows your poems have a forward momentum and were taken
seriously by a smaller publisher.

All the best and I look forward to your ebook :-)

Best, Geoffrey

You say:
I am not a Jewish historian, nor do I study Jewish
culture or Jewish politics etc.
- but you make pronouncement after pronouncement.
I was in Israel a number of times, the first 12 years after the formation
of the State. Most of the people there were refugees from Europe who were
kept out of the US, England, and a host of other countries, who
conveniently treated them as asswipes. Many of the ashkenazim who arrived
weren't zionists at all - I'd say the majority of them. And the religious
right was in the minority.
Meanwhile Europe just expected them to go away. Yes, they displaced Arabs
and yes there have been continuous horrors. But they've been on both
sides. I was shot at myself in 1962 - and until that happens to you, I'd
suggest you at least make the effort to read the history.
The left equates Israel with Zionism which is fucking bullshit. They
equate it with a monolithic arab-hatred which is also fucking bullshit.
They equate Israel with Jews and there are Evangelical groups which would
like the final war to start fast to bring on the rapture.
Most Israelis and most Palestinians want to live in peace, by the way.
As far as horrors go - there have been a hell of a lot of Isarelis killed,
in case you're not aware of that.

I generally keep my mouth shut on stuff like this because the ignorance on
both the right and left are incredible, and I don't know enough to 'teach'
myself. But I do know it's not black and white - and it's so convenient
for Americans and Europeans to blame Israel - when by their exclusionary
acts, their hatred of Jews, they were in large part responsible for the
State.

Get those fucking Jews out of here!
Some of us are still around. For those who think btw that Jews=Israelis
I'd suggest a read of Heeb magazine.

I'm going silent again. I just can't stand what I _do_ see as anti-
semitism. Of what other group would one make pronouncements, and then
state that they haven't studied the culture or history?

From Derek Rogerson:

"11. Can we *finally* acknowledge that there is no Christian magic-spell
controlling the populace and Bush doesn't have 'God' whispering
commandments in-his-ear? That's what this is all about isn't it?"

Derek,
No, I think there's a greater issue here than that of Bush and his right =
wing moguls taking control of the GOP.  There's an issue that runs back =
to at least (as far as the U.S.A. is concerned) as far the U.N. =
Resolution 181 of November 29, 1947. =20

Fact:
in 1947 the Brits pushed (with the help of the U.S.of A.) U.N. =
Resolution 181 through the U.N. General Assembly and used that =
"legality" to stuff the creation of a new Israeli nation down the =
throats of the Arab nations.

at that time, the Brits, ignoring the Arab nation's pleas, reshaped the =
maps of the Trans Jordan and essentially displaced the people of the =
region, forcing Israel...a non-existent place...down the throats (or up =
their arses if you prefer) of the Arabs. =20

What's worse than this insufferably arrogant and ignobly imperial =
behavior on the part of our friends the Brits, is the equally arrogant =
behavior of the nine (9) presidents since HST all of whom have espoused =
an agreement with the premise of establishing an equally independent, =
sovereign nation of Palestine, while at the same time doing nothing to =
actually create such a country. =20

So, are you anti-semitic?  Who gives a good god-damn. =20

Is that the real issue?  Not on your life!

Jews, Arabs (and that is intended to speak of the religions of the =
countries...Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc.) have =
repeatedly demonstrated they have their heads up their asses when it =
comes to accepting each others rights to co-exist. =20

Now, 50 plus years after the 1947 British fiasco, it is far too late to =
reset the geographic lines back to 1946. =20

But, there's another issue here. =20

British (and American) administrators created the Palestine problem.  =
(Trans Jordan's King Abdullah in his speech of April 26, 1948: "...all =
our efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Palestine problem have =
failed.  The only way left for us is war.  I will have the pleasure and =
the honor to save Palestine." )  By the way, the noble man was wrong.  =
There have been 14 wars between 1948 and 1990, and still there is no =
Palestine. =20

So, the Brits and the Americans created the Palestine Problem.  To me, =
that means we, our two countries, are to blame for the 9/11 bombings. =
Also, to me, that means that fighting a war in Iraq is somewhat akin to =
putting a band-aid on your finger in an attempt to cure your in-grown =
toenail...wrong fix focused at the wrong appendage. =20

Can matters be fixed? =20

Indeed.

But fixing has to start with accepting blame for the causal =
relationship; then and only then can the healing begin; then and only =
then can the corrective actions be set in place, the start of which is =
the forced establishment of a free and independent Palestine with legal =
boundaries that Israel has as much to say about deciding as King =
Abdullah had in the decisions of 1947.

And, Derek, your points are well made, though decidedly unpopular in =
this part of the world.  Somehow however, I have a feeling you don't =
really care about that.=20

Alan,
Seems to me you have bought into the Christian/Zionist line of reasoning =
that says, "It was ok for Christians to force the creation of a new =
Israeli nation in 1947/1948."=20

Sorry, I can't buy into that Zionist crap. =20

There never was an Israel on any map of the world ever drawn (and =
indeed, there never was a Palestine).

And, the Babylonians (Iraqi's, if you like) wiped the nations of the =
Jewish faith off the map in the mid 6th  century. =20

That the folks moving to the new Israel in 1948 were indeed refugees is =
too irrelevant to the issue.  These were folks mistreated by Europeans, =
and the Europeans fixed their problem by stuffing it down the throats of =
the Arab nations...sorry, that too was not a fix. =20

Also, that the refugees weren't Zionists is irrelevant to the =
point...the nation existed because Zionists succeeded in winning the =
attention of the powers in Briton and France. =20

In the fourteen wars since 1947 which the Israelis (Jews) have fought =
with their Arab (read Muslim) neighbors, the Israelis have won all.  But =
those victories are tainted because they were won by and with the arms, =
and men of the forces of Briton and the U.S. =20

I don't really give a good rats ass whether there is a Muslim, a Jew, or =
a Christian living anywhere on the face of the earth...and for my money, =
spent on taxes to fund selling weapons to Israel, I'd as soon sell the =
same weapons to Jordan and Egypt and let the assholes kill each other =
off.  I'm certain that the ultimate value in stem-cell research will =
come when scientists find a way to free humanity of the DNA deficiency =
which forces folks to a religious context.   But, the human race, with a =
Bush in charge, is millions of years away from the day of such of a =
discovery, so, as an alternative, I opt to suggest that the U.S. must =
own up to the fact that it has contributed to the cause of the =
difficulty in the middle-East. =20
Alex
P.S. Derek is 100% on target; does he hate Jews (Israelis)?  Who =
cares...is that point relevant to his comments? Fuck no!  And suggesting =
that the issue is either racist or ethnist is ignorance teetering on =
McArthyism. =20

  Meanwhile Europe just expected them to go away. Yes, they displaced =
Arabs
  and yes there have been continuous horrors. But they've been on both
  sides. I was shot at myself in 1962 - and until that happens to you, =
I'd
  suggest you at least make the effort to read the history.
  The left equates Israel with Zionism which is fucking bullshit. They
  equate it with a monolithic arab-hatred which is also fucking =
bullshit.
  They equate Israel with Jews and there are Evangelical groups which =
would
  like the final war to start fast to bring on the rapture.
  Most Israelis and most Palestinians want to live in peace, by the way.
  As far as horrors go - there have been a hell of a lot of Isarelis =
killed,
  in case you're not aware of that.

  I generally keep my mouth shut on stuff like this because the =
ignorance on
  both the right and left are incredible, and I don't know enough to =
'teach'
  myself. But I do know it's not black and white - and it's so =
convenient
  for Americans and Europeans to blame Israel - when by their =
exclusionary
  acts, their hatred of Jews, they were in large part responsible for =
the
  State.

  Get those fucking Jews out of here!
  Some of us are still around. For those who think btw that =
Jews=3DIsraelis
  I'd suggest a read of Heeb magazine.

  I'm going silent again. I just can't stand what I _do_ see as anti-
  semitism. Of what other group would one make pronouncements, and then
  state that they haven't studied the culture or history?

"There was another, more profound conversation, between Professor Said
and Arafat, in 1985 when they were discussing Haj Amin al-Husseini, the
Grand Mufti of Jerusalem who supported the 1936 revolt against British
rule, and who believed the Zionists would take Palestinian land but who
ended up in Berlin, urging Hitler to prevent the emigration of Jews to
Palestine and encouraging Bosnian Muslims to join the SS. Professor Said
told me Arafat said: "Edward, if there's one thing I don't want to be,
it's like Haj Amin. He was always right and he got nothing and died in
exile."

What will they say of Arafat? The Israelis refused permission for Haj
Amin to be buried in Jerusalem. Ariel Sharon has said the same rule will
apply to Arafat. In death, at least, Arafat and Haj Amin were equal."

"We'll go back again to the basic. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
there is an aggressor. This is Israelis. They are occupying the West
Bank and Gaza for the last 37 years. It's a fact. It's an illegal
occupation. ... and totally innocent people, obviously, is the children.
But they are not innocent if they are part of a population which is
total population of Israel is part of the army... From 18 on, they are
part of the soldiers, even if they have civilian clothes.We'll go back
again to the basic. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there is an
aggressor. This is Israelis. They are occupying the West Bank and Gaza
for the last 37 years. It's a fact. It's an illegal occupation...."--Dr

"Listen, wake me up when an Israeli soldier, say one of the "Cherries",
the Border Police undercover death squads, tells his commanding officer,
"That Hamas guy you wanted us to kill? He was off-duty. Couldn't do it."
Or, "He's taking a leave right now. Some kind of family thing. We'll try
again next month." It'll never happen. When the Israelis decide a
Palestinian is the enemy, he's the enemy 24-7-52...."There are no
Israeli civilians, only soldiers on leave"????"

It's shit like this that stops me from posting here. I didn't "buy into"
it if you read - I never thought it was ok. You think I feel the holocaust
was ok? The US etc. turning the ships away? Where the fuck do you get off
and then calling it zionist crap. I'm hardly a zionist and you should know
better.

This list is really fucked up. And yes it's anti-semitic, antijew,
antiarab and far too much posturing.

It's irrelevant that they were refugees? You would prefer I assume they
just killed themselves since no one else would take them in?

I'm furious. I'm going nomail. This shit is nothing but that - shit. I've
been there, in fact worked at one point on the Arab side, and know the
situation first-hand. I've experienced anti-semitism first-hand and been
shot at and fuck it all

you don't know what you're talking about.

It wouldn't matter but anti-semitism is on the rise worldwide and the one
place one would hope for reasoned analysis, studying, etc. etc., would be
on a list of poets who are supposedly sensitive to the plight of all
peoples blah blah blah.

Going nomail. You'll have to suffer my texts, but I can't take this crap
any longer. I made a mistake in replying to Derek

It is true - like everything: the situation is complex - Israel is
effectively an illegal state - that said - it now exists - and the wrongs
done to the Palestinians would not have been done if ordinary Jewish people
could have it otherwise of that I am sure and also the terrible suicide
bombings etc would not happen (there are many "educated Palestinians who
deplore such actions - they may not be "right" but that show the complexity
and the tragedy of the situation there - - it is complex - it is not exactly
"Jews" killing Arabs or visa versa - although of course that is happening
but in a sense - when someone says "Jews slaughter" it sounds as if all Jews
slaughter or want to - a book that somewhat deals with this indirectly is
"Mr Sammler's Planet"  by Saul Bellow (although I prefer his "Herzog") - one
of the relatives of the Jewish-American protagonist (Mr Sammler) has lived
in Israel and returned - in NY he attacks a man quite viciously (albeit in a
kind of self-defence) but the others  (such as Mr Sammler  are horrified  -
I think the point here is that - not that Israelis or Jews are
dangerous/violent people - the point is in Yeats poem where he says 'The
best lack all conviction, the worst are full of passionate intensity' (what
is the actual line?) people on here will know the poem.  Of course Yeats was
not  "political"  - well he was but his politics were not radical left (I
know he had some strange ideas/obsessions ) - who doesn't?

 Here are the possibilities A is a human being.  I is Israel. AS is
anti-Semitic N is normal  ("average " good human - a liberal perhaps) HxA =
hates Arabs (to x degree) LxA Likes or just feels the same about Arabs as
himself to the x degree  HxI  = Hates or disagrees with the Israeli
Govt/power group etc etc ad infinitum... put the letters together  - add
more letters and unknowns - put them together in different combinations etc

The permutations are enormous.

 I read a book by an Israeli (who obviously didn't hate himself!!) who
infiltrated the Palestinian world as an Arab and he showed what it was like
to be a Palestinian (note of course that he also only saw things to a
limited degree -no completely objective views are possible about
nything )  - things weren't all good for the Palestinians (to say the
least) - but of course he had Israeli friends who were "on his side" - when
he went on TV in Israel and 'exposed' the general situation he was attacked
not physically of course -or he may have been).....things were not good

- the history of the Israeli takeover there is not good: but the situation
now is complex and just saying that 'Jews slaughter' is hurtful or
misleading (ok we are adults we here things like that all the time) is not
very productive (but not maybe "wrong" ) we need all of us to see where we
stand on these things as poets (and whether as Alan asks "this has to do
with poetics" and so on.)  - perhaps as important if there are wrongs going
on we need to talk of them openly: not to maybe just condemn one side.

I see Israel and Judaism in general is as being badly misused in the Middle
East and elsewhere - and of course anti-Semitism is still strong all over
the world - that is a terrible thing - which is why I applaud our Prime
Minister for stopping David Irving (the Holocaust denier and supposed
"Historian"  ! Historian!!) to come to NZ - we don't need scum like him) by
the Imperialist powers.

But there are also many Arabs who are beyond reason - simply hate all Jews -
and Jews who hate all Arabs - which is sad - but as poets we need to be able
to imagine all sides of things....the Australian poet Francis Webb wrote a
radio play on The Last Days of Hitler - not to exonerate Hitler but in an
attempt to understand what motivates such people - one thinks of Gita
Sereny - who is Jewish  - and her interviews with Nazis  or ex Nazis etc

Sontag somewhere refers to the Hitler problem (the rise of the Nazis - who
seems to have been unprecedented in the depravity into which they
descended - but I suppose there are other historical examples of extreme
ugliness)  as THE problem of the 20th Century - I would love to have poetry
that was completely free of politics - whether that politics is explicit or
implicit or in some way affects the poem/writings)  - I was moving that was
in 2001 (I had contempt of referential or political poems etc) - S/11
changed that.....

I know Alan is deeply troubled by (these) things - but I know that he
himself knows that even in his own works "reality" is intruding: and we have
to address these issues - even talking about them helps us - in an ideal
world no one would be killing

I cannot imagine killing a person - I have never even killed an animal.   I
would in self defence I suppose.

I hear also what alan has said since I first drafted this and express my
disgust of this windbag alexander saliby whose facts - in some cases - may
be right but shows geat insensitivity  - the tone of his posts verge on mad
anti-Semitism

extreme. He will rock you with readings from God Save My Queen and God Save
My Queen II (Soft Skull Press, 2003 and 2004).

   As if in my own benediction ceremony, I would lay
   out all of the Queen albums, flush next to each
   other, in order of release, on my bedroom floor.
   The 45s from each album would lay on top of them,
   in the lower right-hand corner, also in order of
   release, from bottom to top...

world traveler, and dashing young SLU professor, Devin will grace us with
poems from his new collection, Aversions (Omnidawn, 2004).

   Now, in sight of Lion's Head,
   you cut the outboard engine. "Look,
   a butcher bird!-which Whitely gave
   the eyes of Baudelaire."

 "UNCANNILY PRECISE RESPONSES OF AN EXACTING LYRIC."
 -Susan Howe


BOB HARRISON :  This Milwaukee poet is the editor of the world-famous
literary journal Crayon, editor of the Bronze Skull Chapbook series, and
author of Mola (Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs, 2004). Bob's newest book, Os,
is forthcoming from Subpress.

No one ever said it was and no one ever said it does not signify the Jewish
people; all people have said, in one way or another, is that Jews are not
monolithic when it comes to Israel and the Palestinians and you should not
talk about us as if we are.

>>2. I was not aware of a difference between 'those Jews' and 'other Jews'
when I made my post<<

Well, now that you are, I would hope you would take responsibility for that
knowledge by changing your rhetoric to account for that knowledge.

>>3. Everyone is reading a great deal more into what I have happened to
say as an aside to demonstrate 'divine inspiration' than what I was
clearly intending. Given recent events it is clear to me that
Jews/Israelis appear to carry around a tremendous amount of baggage
attached to their ethnicity and the word(s) used to describe it -- and I
don't want to get involved with this stuff (you call yourselves Jews so
I call you the same, like Hilton said)<<

First, that is not what Hilton said. Go read his post more carefully. More
importantly, though, now that you are aware that Jews are not monolithic,
why do you insist on conflating Jews and Israelis?

>>4. The Jew/Israeli distinction is confusion -- but regardless how
conflated those words are I still had Jews/Israelis attacking me on this
list for no reason I could fathom and I don't like it<<

Confusion for whom? Not for Jews, certainly, and if it is your confusion,
then it is your responsibility to clear the confusion up for yourself and,
again, to change your rhetoric to account for this new clarity. You haven't
done that yet. At least not in this post.

>>7. It is not unreasonable to indicate that Jews/Israelis (whomever you
want to call this group, you know who I mean -- the people who are
performing these actions)...

8. And if there is a problem, the problem can be nicely approached and
calmly explained without every Jew/Israeli (you know who I mean, that
cultural group of people on this list)....

9. Whatever problem people have with the Jew/Israeli terminology are
problems they carry around themselves. Don't blame me if you have
special meaning for some words I couldn't possibly have known being
outside the group....<<

And still you insist on not changing your rhetoric, on not taking any
responsibility for what you admit was your own ignorance and on blaming
others for that ignorance, and it is that willful decision, Derek, more than
anything else you have written in this thread that, in my mind, makes you
the anti-Semite I have tried very, very hard not to call you personally. You
will say that I am attacking you ad hominem, that I am interested in
smearing you in some way, that I am trying to bully you into silence, along
with all of the other charges that you have made against the people who have
tried to hold you accountable for the way you have said what you have said,
and that's fine. I have no illusion that I will change your mind, nor do I
care to try. You either will or you will not take seriously what I and
others have tried to say to you, and you either will or you will not stop
being so damned defensive and take a look at your own beliefs and
assumptions about Jews and who we are, and you either will or you will
not--and you have not so far--change the way you talk about things to
accommodate what you have learned. Until you do those things, then the label
anti-Semite will not be an inaccurate one.

But I will say this: It gives me no pleasure at all, and it in fact pains
me, especially when talking about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, to get
mired in the problem of how anti-Semitism weaves itself in and out of this
discussion--even though, as Hilton said, it is almost impossible to
avoid--precisely because it so easily becomes a distraction from what should
be the real issue, which is the occupation and how to end it, the brutality
being practiced by each side against the other--though Israel is clearly the
more powerful of the two players--and so on. I will not, however, pretend
that it is possible to have a meaningful dialogue with someone who is not
willing to respect who I am by talking about me and my community in a way
that reflects accurately how that community understand itself and the
realities of that community's existence.

As a point of fact, there are Israeli Arabs, citizens of Israel and
therefore Israelis, who are not Jewish.

i attended a talk a few weeks ago in which i learned that during his
conversation w/ hitler, the grand mufti of jerusalem (arafat's uncle)
asked what he shd do w/ the jews who were coming to palestine --he
wanted to initiate something like the Final Solution himself.  hitler
said: they're yours to do with as you will.
hilton, do you know about this? it was a talk by jeffrey mehlman. i
don't want to get my facts wrong on this incendiary topic.

 Being a refugee must be awful. If I think about it, what it might be like,
 it makes me fearful, though it is the mode of life for quite a large part
of
 the world's population. (And add to that migrant workers.) I doubt few
North
 Americans and Britons who are not _recent_ immigrants can imagine it fully.

 In such circumstances, asking for, even demanding, shelter is entirely
 justifiable. But what some did in Palestine was to go further and say This
 is ours. And now they claim the right to be there on the extremely doubtful
 basis of ethnicity

 The Balfour Declaration guaranteed - on whose authority  is unclear - a
 homeland in Palestine. Not a state.

 Alan didn't mention it, but I'll drag it in, I do not see Israel is any
kind
 of democracy when the greater part of the electorate has been frightened
off
 its land and out of a vote; and a whole load of other guys, many those and
 their children who
 *had been let into other countries - and they have been given votes.

 Yes, it was a long time ago, but the conquest goes on. Jugoslavia predates
 the declaration of Israel and that has
 been dismembered. The Irish conflict goes back and back and that's
favourite
 (ha!) to be solved et cetera

 It is no democracy. I cannot see it is a legitimate state. But as an in so
 many things, it is the work of a few. To attribute the blame wholesale on a
 racial basis is as reprehensible as the declaration of the right of
conquest
 on a racial basis.

Maria,

About to leave on plane to Seattle.  The alliance between the Mufti and
Nazi Germany is true ("The enemy of my enemy . . ."), just as Jabotinsky's
sympathies for Mussolini are true or Herzl's meeting with the Czarist
organizer of pograms Plehve or Mosh Dayan supporting the US in
Vietnam.  Ugly alliances on both sides, all driven by crude political
maneuvers or ideological parallels.  Alan Sondheim is angry because he's
lived the conflict -- and there would be anger from a Palestinian who
experienced the kinds of things he has.  If there's going to be any hope,
it's important to get away from rearguing the Balfour Declaration or who
started the 1967 War or the Mufti of Jerusalem.  There is blood on
everyone's hands, no one is innocent, and both Israelis and Palestinians
live on top of each other.  Now what?  Most want peace and are willing to
figure it out -- but political leaders and the US, particularly with
Christian Zionists in the ascendency, do much to keep the situation unresolved.

I don't know about this particular conversation between Said and Arafat,
but it doesn't sound unrealistic to have occurred.  The Mufti was the
titular leader of the Palestinian community at the time.

Gotta go.

this I do not believe.  and usually it is meant to delegitimate social justice sympathizers (I so remember Dickens' plangent portrait of the bourgeois femme who feels for Africans but not her children).  and yet Jesse Helms, he who hated many in general (including Carolina students en masse) was said to be a charming and cordial man in person who adopted handicapped kids and came out for the rights of the "disabled."

Derek,

I thought you were considering yourself a Jewish/Israeli historian and seem
to be very proud of it.

The history of Jews goes over two thousand years, and Israel exists since
1948. How are they exactly the same?

Well, Bush *claims* he has God giving him commandments through his
gut. One might wish that Bush were getting commandments in words
rather than in gut feelings, I suppose -- they might be clearer. Then
again, perhaps we might find we should have been grateful that they
were not clearer.

The Germans would have destroyed Paris if the French hadn't surrendered, and
Paris is an idea that belongs to us all. So we should be thankful that the
French were civilized, and they did put together an amazing underground of
resistance that helped defeat the Nazis. While the Germans, whose ethos was,
"Stay the Course," watched their cities being fire-bombed. Long Live Paris,
the City of Light!

Are we in the midst of a hate parade?

Not to speak of how stupid this is. You retail an entrenched attitude--you
might want to do some reading. Lots of French collaborated, but on the
other hand 100,000 French troops died in the brief time before the
surrender, with no end in sight given the strategic situation, and 250,000
members of the resistance bought it in subsequent years. The US lost
altogether 250,000 in all theaters from a population three times as large.

This doesn't count civilian casualties, of which the US had almost none.

The French sustained something like 3 million deaths in WWI. This might
have had something to do with their diminished eagerness to die in a
hopeless fight.

The occupied country with by far the greatest percentage of collaborators
was the Netherlands, to which we tend to be more generous.

350 Years of American Jewry, 1654-2004:
Transcending the European Experience?
International Scholarly Conference at the
Akademie f=FCr Politische Bildung, Tutzing,
in cooperation with Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich
and the University of Erfurt.

Registration: Akademie f=FCr Politische Bildung Tutzing, Buchensee 1, 82327=

Tutzing, Tel. 08158/256-0; Fax: 08158/256-14+15,=20
<http://www.apb-tutzing.de/>http://www.apb-tutzing.de
Fee (accommodation and meals, 4 days): ? 110.-


The Conference:

The main theme of the conference will revolve around the question: Did=20
America keep the promise it originally made to Jewish immigration from=20
Europe, and if so - how was the American Jewish Experience different -=20
where in particular was it able to transcend the limits of the European=20
experience?
Trying to focus on this question, we hope to create a new trans-national=20
perspective on Jewish history which is largely missing from American=20
History as well as from Jewish Studies. Such an approach will also help us=
=20
to move beyond the narrow boundaries of Ethnic History and integrate Jewish=
=20
History into the larger narrative of Jewish-non-Jewish relations in various=
=20
societies.

I've just posted some new "reviews" on my bloggy 5cense reviews site
(www.5cense.com), including a southwest travel journal with pictures of
Native American Graffiti/Petroglyphs
(http://sleepingfish.net/5cense/SW/SW3_Native_American_Graffiti.htm) and
reviews of the new Tom Waits and Nick Cave albums
(http://sleepingfish.net/5cense/SW/SW2_Roadtrip_Music.htm).

I welcome contributions of a more literary or poetic nature, so if you have
something to review in an unconventional, "sensory" and intentionally
subjective way, now is your chance. If you have any new books or magazines
that you want reviewed in this light, email me directly.

I will also be posting guidelines for the next SleepingFish (issue 0.75)
soon, so stay tuned.

Indeed, and when I read I often find I don't know things that I thought I
did.

I suspect the occupational problem for many of us is not the writing - and
what is learned in the process - but when to know it's time to shut up!
What are they called, "pregnant silences." ?
The reader as "midwife."

Look it Richard: have not used any words with any intention to inflict
hate or incite maliciousness or any anything resembling anything like
that. I have even apologized for saying something you have taken
completely the wrong way. I'm sorry you have this mental baggage, I'm
sorry that you insist on trying to make me carry it also, but listen --
I have no interest in carrying it. If you don't like to be called Jewish
when that is the only word I have available to me to describe your
ethnicity then either I have to shut up and be coerced to silence and
give you free-reign to do whatever you like because you are 'above
reproach and discussion' or I can claim my own independence to speak
freely and civilly. Stop telling me what I can and can not speak within
the scope of polite discussion and **stop attributing negative racial
intention to my words** -- all these things are things *you* are doing
and have nothing to do with me. Get a grip on life!

I don't hold enmity towards any racial, cultural, or religious group and
I never will.

If you have to unjustly call me anti-semitic because that's what you
believe then you are just a malicious idiot. But I'm starting very much
to form a dislike for this line of interrogation. You are acting like a
person who believes they are above every other person like they have
been chosen as superior to all others -- a spoiled brat. Try respecting
everyone as equals (not as people beneath you) and stop 'correcting'
people and believing everyone needs to be 'put in their place'. If you
want to correct a fact, correct it -- but you are not trying to correct
facts you are trying to put me into cultural submission. I will make up
my own mind about things, thank you, and I will not alter myself, even
under threat of force, to accommodate your political and/or cultural
beliefs. A statement is effectively anti-semitic only if there is,
somewhere, an intention to use it for anti-semitic purposes -- not if
Richard or Alan or Mark from their high-altar proclaim it is
anti-semitic. There is no anti-semitic intention to my words and I don't
appreciate your undying efforts to attribute racial hate to them (even
you must get everyone in the land to come onlist and make that assertion
there is still no intention). Stop trying to neuter me. Stop trying to
circumcise my mind. You have a real mental problem and I don't want to
have anything to do with it.

        -- leave me alone you thought-police freaks, Derek

Why why why would you ever think I considered myself Jewish/Israeli
historian and even more to be very proud of anything?? I can't stand it.
Where is this misinformation coming from? Where have I given any
indication of this? 1948 is so many decades before I was even born!

ugh! Being called an upstart is even more distressing to me than being
called anti-semitic. People need to immediately remove me as a subject
for their discussions and stop using me as a metaphor in their writings.
Please.

You seem mighty sure of your opinion for someone who's displaying a great
degree of cultural ignorance. You really don't have to be a Jewish historian
to realize that Jew & Israeli are not interchangeable terms.

But cultural ignorance does not necessarily make you a monster, & it can be
a temporary condition. Let me hip you to "The Other Israel: Voices of
Refusal and Dissent" edited by Roane Carey (The New Press 2002). You'll find
the writings of Israeli Jewish writers, reservists, activists & former
government officials courageously resisting their government's unjust
actions against Palestinians.

This may be slightly off-the-point, given the amount of
more-heatedness-than-light generated by this particular discussion, but am I
the only person who's bothered by the conflation of "Jew" and "Jewish"
(before we even get to Israel)?

It seems to me (non-Jew[ish]) that "Jew" is a racial signifier that can (all
too often, sometimes unintentionally) elide into anti-semitism, while
"Jewish" is a cultural signifier that embraces ever-so-many things ...

I find myself reluctant to use the term "Jew", in exactly the same way I'd
be reluctant to use the term "nigger".

            There's a hell of a lot of previous around both terms ...

The Book of Brueckl  Part 1

Based on the rapturous visions of Bob Brueckl

(From "The Highland Testament")


Moral joy suddenly humming: grammar's feelings
clenched emptiness: if ideation-yawpers, in the sneer of
death speckled and figural: in denial, induced stares
lightening desire: pentagonal tongue collapsing: useless
spores of lightness gawking: they came with the tedious
absence of sunlight peeping into the estrangement of tangled
flaws' germination drainage, corpses of night transcend the
impure sounds: undefiled under collapsed sentences, bruised
flank of vaporous consternation in banished palms: not
alone, pretty soon, reopened voices' fir in the wretchedness
of metonymics' magnetic alacrities attributed to be: jackal
of Jesse, gradual green atrocities sharply melting
madrigals: flames of thorns, hours out of earshot, unanimous
sacs unthought, appositely ecstatic lips never being
construed as you can be: not at all: it is to see the felt
dots pretending forehead waves, grandeur of foraging
backwards: unapproachable crack: fluency of caresses:
madrigal extrapolated, uttered, undefiled: devised joy:
heartbeat, glory teeth: unpleasantly upside down pleasure,
tumbling mica's recalcitrant impunity, never losing their
impotence in the spacious factory, in adoration, coming
apart against haughty crawling words' bosoms' bones,
diminishing gradually diminished: ah, wounds glowing, as it
could be not there: pressed sounds eventual apotheosis, no
difference, creeping, rock chatter: not that it is as it is
disturbed, retracted, tainted, inversely multicolored,
exposed: a gaggle of a pale footnote to be, wrath of
wave-pierced illusions: technical squiggles, open-mouthed
wherewithal: dosages of blushing revenge fawning: another
subject, mine too, debilitated: intense sheer lines leap:
wrinkled mechanisms attaching themselves to be opposed to
and breadth of a gaggle of night transcend the machinery of
radioactive words of lightness gawking: they came with an
apparent interruption, leaning on the scented niche:
identical: it is to oblivion's abandoned faucet: immense,
whenever it is as it is: no particular cancerous notations:
perversely nondescript: subordinate notes colliding,
indisputable sticks vibrating along the curving seizure of
mirrors, the throbbing disturbances of the diminished bosom,
spirals' pangs, listening seeds: dead wood wholly saturated
on a gaggle of night's thirst, thick conduits in collusion
with kisses: sullen seascape, sunrise from the apotheosis of
the luggage of treetops: density easily knows the root of
trickling sludge, starlight's instants in the audacity of
trickling sludge, starlight's instants in derision: Not even
differentiated hyacinths' diminished bosom, airy pangs of
treetops: density easily knows the corrosive hours, brittle
pretexts bickering: I, too, dislike Satan's semen: blushing
shoals leaning on the ailanthus: suddenly swerving to the
throbbing twigs swaying above the periphery of abating mud:
perpendicular, disjunction flesh: they were coming from the
impure identity of lovers' dawns, malignant sky of lightness
gawking: they know peeling window panes, starlights'
mnemonic blooms: the unreal: outside, the reluctance of
impure sounds: undefiled under the apotheosis of subsumed
parameters squandered, coded inanity: snapshot prop
spiraling a lethal mildness, light grey, rubbed raw:
merciless abruptness sharpens the instant is to and breadth
of monotony swells like vocabulary, coalesced turd colorings
signature: voiceless sap dust oozing indistinctly, and
breadth of a paler typo: copious dosages, rectangular soil

nondescript: subordinate notes colliding, indisputable
sticks vibrating along the vehicle of gold-fringed blossoms
are undefiled under collapsed sentences, bruised flank of
the breath of wet light: shrinking subterfuge, leaping off
branches of evergreens' swollen clutter, inert nouns dazed:
waking pod, mired cortex: I desire an agitated piece of
tormented moments, assays enemas' commas obtruding on the
invisible scent of differences between repeated wastes
cleaving apart, all in all: it can be not that reeks of the
enduring insertion of morning's bedewed pistache, nestled
pallor, compressed circumstances in spits presence: never: I

unanimous sacs unthought, appositely ecstatic lips never
being construed as the wane, plaiting, lapsed: delicate
illusions rearranged, maybe oblique ambiance swooning, low

barely a sacred reaction to afflictions of trickling sludge,

Hi Robin,

"White," "black," and "Indian" also have a hell of a lot of previous, and
most Americans don't find them at all offensive. I am a Jew, and Jew is my
racial indicator. It's pretty clear, as soon as a racial indicator leaves
someone's lips and/or fingers, how they mean it, be it "Jew" or
"African-American."

I grew up in Atlanta, and I would be loathe to place the word "Jew"
anywhere near the same catagory as "nigger."

Anne Tardos has just written that Jackson Mac Low died this morning. It
seemed to me immediately that this was of great public consequence, and
personal sadness. This was her message:

Dear Friends,

We are sad to announce that Jackson Mac Low died this morning at 11:30 a.m.
at Cabrini hospital in New York from complications after a stroke he
suffered on November 4th. He was 82.

There will be no funeral, but he will be buried at Cedar Park Cemetery in
Oradell, NJ.

A memorial will be held in the future.

The last hope of the British in North America was at Yorktown,
Virginia in 1781. But they faced a French naval and ground force
that won France's greatest victory over the British in the past
half-century. There were some US troops there, as well, and when
the British commander attempted to surrender his sword to the
French commander, someone went to find George Washington,
and he accepted the gesture.

During all this conversation no one has said the obvious- Israel was founded
and Zionism is based on the idea that there should be a national home for
the Jewish people in Palestine, Herzl uses the word Jewish People not
Israeli in his book, The Jewish State. Israel has a law of return that says
that any Jew can return to Israel they define Jew as anyone who has a Jewish
mother. It is disingenious to say that Jewish and Israeli are not the same
the fact is that all Jews are not Israelis but 90% of all Israelis are Jews.

This reality can be confirmed by the fact that in 1947 according to the
British Mandate census 475,000 Jews lived in Mandate Palestine as related to
2.2 million Arabs of these 2.2 million 650,000 were Christian the balance
Muslims. In 1948 there were over 1200 Arab towns in mandate Palestine today
there are less than 400 Arab towns in Palestine and Israel combined.  It is
not Anti Semitic to ask the simple question what happened to these
Palestinian towns and people?

Before I get the "you are an Antisemite" comment while I am a member of the
Catholic Church my Maternal Grandfather was a
Sephardic Jew from Padova in Italy so my feelings of conflict are strong on
this point since I have relatives in Israel and I do on the whole support
the right of Israel to exist but not to kill and destroy Arabs simply
because they are in the way.

It easy for certain Americans to sneer at the French ( certain Americans of
a certain quality or lack of any qualities) the US has never been attacked -
I don't call S/11 an attack - a pin prick and also probably organised from
within the US - but the US has never been largely occupied by modern armies
or attacked as France was - of course there was the American
evolution  -and hats of to the US for defeating Japan but after that - US
Imperialism - downhill ..dragging the world with it - the US always
cultivates collaborators so they know all about collaborating - the FBI now
are even criticising the terrible treatment of prisoners at Guantanmaro
Bay - hats off to those Americans (Bush will try to suppress them and also
recent CIA criticism - yes the CIA are a big and complex organization) -
they relied on collaborators to get the so-called terrorists in there - the
CIA take millions of US$ cash into the Middle East and elsewhere to win wars
and win "the good  guys" - in fact some battles are/were won by cash payouts
to collaborators.

Many of the US people - particularly smart woofters like Marcus  Balls - are
wittingly / or other collaborating with the War OF  Terror  - "creeping
fascism" I heard someone call  it the other day...if we have not reached a
fascist situation already (as Mailer surmised a few years back) and I
include NZ as NZ collaborates with Imperialist countries.

M Balez forgets the heroism of thousands of French people who sacrificed
their lives in the resistance.

This thing from Marcus Bolles is at the best stupid at the worst sick.

Derek, you wrote (and I promise, after this, I will, as you request, unless
you change your mind, remove you as a subject of discussion):

>>A statement is effectively anti-semitic only if there is,
somewhere, an intention to use it for anti-semitic purposes<<

And yet our words escape our best intentions all the time. Words have
histories, as do rhetorics, and we are born into them and they are borne by
us; we grow up with them; and they grow, whether we like it or not, in ways
that we are rarely aware of until something happens to make us see, in us. I
know many, many words that reduce the meaning of a Black man or woman's
existence to the color of his or her skin, and I know how to use them, and I
know as well many, many words that reduce the meaning of a woman's existence
to her biology, and I know how to use those words too, and I could go on,
listing example after example until I could think of no other group to add,
and then I know the time would come when something would happen to show me
my own ignorance and I would understand that my list would have to grow
longer by one more. I did not ask to learn these words or the ideas and
attitudes that give them the power they have; nor did any of us; but the
fact is that they are part of me, part of us; they are part of the legacy
our culture hands us, and one thing I have learned is that it matters deeply
what we do with that legacy, that what we do with that legacy is in some
sense the only thing that matters.

Racism and anti-Semitism and sexism are systems, and it was the system of
anti-Semitism that I saw at work in your posts, not only but primarily in
the statement you made about Jews believing God commanded us to kill
Palestinians. You insist your intentions were not and are not anti-Semitic,
and I will continue to take you at your word, and to point out that this is
why I was very careful in my initial posts to say that I was not calling you
anti-Semitic. And it seems to me that this is the point of disagreement
between us: the degree to which we each see the system of anti-Semitism at
work in the language we use. I see it there and you do not, though it seems
to me that you have *chosen* not to see it there, and it is what seemed to
me, after your second to last post, the willfulness of that decision,
nothing else, that led me to say that you were being consciously and
willfully anti-Semitic.

Derek, I am not interested in silencing you or intimidating you or neutering
you or in circumcising your mind or any of the other things you think I am
trying to do, and I will be the first to admit the possibility that I am
wrong. On that question, however--and, as I said, I will not respond to you
or after this--I am perfectly happy to let our posts speak for themselves.

Isaq quoted Genet:

>>"Very smart of Israel to carry the war right into the heart of
vocabulary..."
--Jean Genet<<

I wrote in an earlier post:

"It gives me no pleasure at all, and it in fact pains me, especially when
talking about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, to get mired in the problem
of how anti-Semitism weaves itself in and out of this discussion...precisely
because it so easily becomes a distraction from what should be the real
issue, which is the occupation and how to end it, the brutality being
practiced by each side against the other--though Israel is clearly the more
powerful of the two players--and so on. I will not, however, pretend that it
is possible to have a meaningful dialogue with someone who is not willing to
respect who I am by talking about me and my community in a way that reflects
accurately how that community understands itself and the realities of that
community's existence."

Sometimes it is not "Israel" who carries the war into the heart of
vocabulary.


Raymond Bianchi wrote:

>>It is disingenious to say that Jewish and Israeli are not the same the
fact is that all Jews are not Israelis but 90% of all Israelis are Jews.<<

In Israel, it may indeed be disingenuous to say that Jew and Israeli are not
pretty much synonymous--a point I made in an earlier post. It is, however,
inaccurate to claim that they are anywhere near synonymous terms when you
start talking about the Jews outside of Israel, who make up the majority of
Jews in the world. The fact that Israel has a law of return was not
something that we all voted on and so it should not be understood as a law
that represents in any way the will of the Jewish people as a whole. Nor
does the fact that Herzl believed himself to be speaking for the Jewish
people as a whole mean that, in fact, he was. There was actually, in New
York, prior to 1948 some very strong Jewish opposition to the founding of
the Jewish State of Israel. (I do not know the history well; I just know the
opposition existed.) Besides, it seems to me what matters now, in terms of
what you say here, has more to do with the stance of Jews in and out of
Israel towards the Israeli government's policies--not to mention the actions
of people in the settlements, etc.--than it does with historical documents.

There is nothing anti-Semitic about pointing out that Herzl's Zionism, like
all European nationalisms, had and has a good dose of (the white man's)
imperialism in it, and that this imperialism has been and continues to be
visited with devastating consequences on the Palestinians. Nor is it
anti-Semitic to point out that the Israeli government's policies and actions
are often justified using rhetoric that makes it look like that government
speaks for the Jewish people as a whole or that uses the Jewish religion as
if it were some sort of universal truth that all other people should
recognize and accede to. Nor is it anti-Semitic to point out that
anti-Semitism is often used by Jews who support Israel--and sometimes by
non-Jews as well--to frighten critics of Israel into silence. Nor is it
anti-Semitic to suggest that Jews who do that ought to be ashamed of
themselves for exploiting victimhood in the name of the Israeli occupation.

But it would be nice to have a discussion of anti-Semitism that looked
anti-Semitism squarely in the face as something that exists far beyond the
parameters of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Indeed, I think the
phenomenon of using the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to circumscribe
discussions of anti-Semitism is one that is worth looking at. This whole
discussion began, or at least the part that I have played in it, not with
the suggestion that Derek's statement was anti-Semitic because it was
critical of Israel, but rather because it generalized about Jews, and it is
the license that people feel they have to make that generalization, to
conflate Jews and Israelis, that I wish this discussion had focused on.

Anyway, it is late and I am tired, and I think there is little else to say
about this.

1. I was not aware the word 'Christian' was a dirty word -- I only used it to


indicate Christian people (see http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Christian


for my usage)


2. I was not aware of a difference between 'those Christians' and 'other


Christians' when I made my post


3. Everyone is reading a great deal more into what I have happened to


say as an aside to demonstrate 'divine inspiration' than what I was


clearly intending. Given recent events it is clear to me that


Christians/Americans appear to carry around a tremendous amount of baggage


attached to their ethnicity and the word(s) used to describe it -- and


I don't want to get involved with this stuff (you call yourselves Christians so


I call you the same, like Hilton said)


4. The Christian/American distinction is confusion -- but regardless how


conflated those words are I still had Christians/Americans attacking me on


this list for no reason I could fathom and I don't like it


5. The violent land-grab that is going on in Palestine *is undisputedly*


religiously motivated and should be subject to a great deal of


scrutiny.


6. I don't hate anybody, especially Christians, especially anybody


7. It is not unreasonable to indicate that Christians/Americans (whomever you


want to call this group, you know who I mean -- the people who are


performing these actions), even just some of them, are bulldozing


Palestinian homes and maiming and torturing and killing Palestinians


expressly because of a divine commandment from God (what Joel might


call 'divine inspiration') -- so what's the problem with my indication,


especially just to demonstrate 'divine inspiration'?


8. And if there is a problem, the problem can be nicely approached and


calmly explained without every Christian/American (you know who I mean, that


cultural group of people on this list) going ape-shit and throwing all


kinds of hate-filled ad hominem crap in my direction


9. Whatever problem people have with the Christian/American terminology are


problems they carry around themselves. Don't blame me if you have


special meaning for some words I couldn't possibly have known being


outside the group, I am not a Christianish historian, nor do I study Christianish


culture or Christianish politics etc. *(this thread has been a lesson) -- to


me Christianish people 'adhere to Christianity as a religion or culture and/or


identify themselves as Christian' and that is not a racial slur that's


like Hindu, Jew, etc.. so I don't know what hell you saying because it


really is conflated, I don't see how an American is not a Christian and I


don't see why anyone would read all kinds of terrible meaning into what I


said other than to use it as cheap fodder to smear my character because they


yearned to do so before anything was said at all


10. I continue to not appreciate people assigning and ascribing


particular religious faiths or beliefs to myself and/or assuming what I


believe religiously -- and I certainly don't appreciate this childish


martyr-mocking bullshit either


11. Can we *finally* acknowledge that there is no Christian magic-spell


controlling the populace and Bush doesn't have 'God' whispering


commandments in-his-ear? That's what this is all about isn't it?





Adios, Derek

Thank you Ter!

The miracle of the eight days of limited oil versus the birth of the =
savior versus the koran.

What I know is the truth:

And that is family and friends.

All the rest is words on a page.

History is always a bunch of losers who are crafty.

Eternity is always the honesty and truthfulness of the now.

I am the now.

The now is always anonymity.

History is Bush.

  I am Jewish (the truth)

  Jew IS a dirty word.

  I have lived in Israel and on a Kibbutz (truthfully)

  The conditions were dangerous. The Kibbutz was near a Palestinian =
settlement
  from which terrorists crossed the border into the Kibbutz and had shot =
and
  killed people living on the Kibbutz.

  I have also lived in Monsey New York studying the Talmud with =
ultra-orthodox
  Chassidic Jews.

  I celebrate Hanukah. My wife is not Jewish. She is Japanese. So we =
also
  celebrate Christmas.

  In elementary school I was called a dirty Jew and it was the first =
time and
  last time I have ever threw a punch at someone.

  The Zionist Jews in Israel and the Chassidic Jews in Monsey New York =
are a
  different kind of Jew than I am.

  Jewish identity has many different meanings to many different people.

  The issue is not complicated.

  What is complicated is how people entrench themselves in an identity =
that is
  in conflict with the identity of someone else.

  That's all.

  All the rest of the talk is venting and ideology.

"...Like a miraculous street artist he beckons us over to watch as he
paints prophetic lines and shadows on the pavement. The image complete,
he walks away with a shrug.

.....There is no doubting that once again he has nailed his colours to
the mast of the oppressed, to the "metaphysical revolution of the
native". In this instance the Palestinian, as before it had been that of
the Black Panthers and before that the Algerian revolution. Said reports
that in Beirut in the autumn of 1972, speaking of Sartre's strong
pro-Israeli stance, Genet had said: "He's a bit of a coward for fear
that his friends in Paris might accuse him of anti- semitism if he ever
said anything in support of Palestinian rights." Genet would probably
not have been surprised to see otherwise admiring critics, like Edmund
White, fearful that such an accusation might be levelled against him,..."

"On 11 September 1982, Israeli Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, the
architect of the invasion, announced that "2,000 terrorists" had
remained inside the Palestinian refugee camps around Beirut. ...Around
mid-day on Thursday 16 September 1982, a unit of approximately 150
Israeli-allied Phalangists entered the first camp. For the next 40
hours members of the Phalangist militia raped, killed, and injured a
large number of unarmed civilians, mostly children, women and elderly
people inside the encircled and sealed camps. The estimate of victims
varies between 700 (the official Israeli figure) to 3,500."

I have never encountered any person
of more intense internal confrontation
with the reality of social experience on the'
one hand, provoking a concomitant sense
of personal political responsibility,
and the desire and ability to focus continuously
on the reality of internal thought and
experience,  at the other pole,
as it is or could be encompassed in or by
forms of verbal expression.
A  powerful current connected these poles
in the writing of Jackson Mac Low, sparking
an immensely powerful, dense, astoundingly continuous stream
of beautiful, haunting, complexly evocative and inventive poetic objects.
All of this from a person of incomparable modesty and humility,
yet unmatchable humor and vivacity, particularly in performance of
his own or others' poetic or artistic works.

Although his works will surely forever continue to nourish, his human
presence will be sorely missed and its memory cherished by all who knew or
were touched by him.

"Time will be wasted
but honesty
whether in light from an Argend lamp
or arc light
or Aufklarung

Tragedy.

Idiocy.

Honesty?

An  aureole springs around a formerly hated form.

You must stay alive."

think they're not
it's like the black/white thing

i heard a lady say today she's coming out a being christian
and it was scary    why  because of the anti-semites in the whitehouse
who use israel as a pawn

too bad the jewish state wasn't established in ny or florida
anyway  we got a raw  deal
and the palestinians are certainly getting a raw deal
but why waste your energy on all this  intellectualizing rhetoric  by
so many  wonderful warm christians
we killed their god remember

BARABAS   lives on in israell - he's just a bit too heavty handed- right
wing

and israelis are jews  just not ny jews
and most israelis i know and that's quite a few  of course oppose the
right wing
fascist israeli gov't
but the isreali guys in the shoestore below me
want palestine to be blown to smitereens


but hey  no pal  is   stein is a pal o mine   and the brits certainly did
create a frankenstein

Why didn't they settle the Israelis  in Canada?

                        Tell me two questions and I'll tell two lies.

        For all of me, I think Malamud got it right in "The Jewbird".

Jew "can be" a dirty word  (but it isn't always )  - the usage of all words
affect  them and as someone who quoted Genet implicitly noted "How clever of
Israel  ..."  (Genet was a great writer I loved his "Miracle of the Rose")
but really of course language has been distorted or twisted or enhanced by
language - extreme Zionists I don't like - but then its there - the problem
of Israel's colonisation of the Trans Jordan and pushing out several hundred
thousands of Palestinians, the murders in Lebanon etc wont go away so
easily - we are right - all of us - even if we go ad hominem  - or not - to
discuss this - I didn't want by the way to shut down (Derek was it - maybe
he confused me with Richard Jefferson..) my dispute here was with the tone
but then my own tone has been strident (once I got angry and said I wanted
Israel driven into the sea) but I realise that the situation in the world
and in Palestine is complex - that said I am more  "on the side" of the
Palestinians - but I can understand the angst that Alan suffers and I am not
anti-Semitic - I hope no one on here is - my comment before that  I think it
was derek objected to - felt that his post was kind of cacophonic so that it
SOUNDED as if he hated Jews  - I don't think he does but  - in the light of
the way Alan Sondheim was deeply affected I leapt to Alan's defence - as
while the Israel - Palestine problem is terrible - it is also true that
anti-Semitism is still strong - it would be whether Zionism existed or not -
but we hope for a world in the long run where people don't hate on the basis
of race etc

That is our aim - it will take time - but it is possible for a more tolerant
world - but it will take time and it is an ongoing struggle - there are no
utopias - struggle is what we are - we need struggle: of ideas, for
production, between genders, class, culture etc

I often think of W C Williams poem when he was at a football game - the
crowd - in the crowd people change so that the "blond" is "attacked" by wolf
whistles and "the Jew gets it"  - WCWs wasn't a saint himself but he knew
the world..................When I was in NY in 1993 (all the way from NZ -
only other place o/s NZ I've been to is Fiji) I was fascinated to see so
many Jews in caps and also the Hassidic Jews. And all the other people -
each person unique in themselves.

My first contact was with a guy who runs (or he ran) (I think he is part
owner -or maybe he was just a curator) of a NY Art gallery (he had a PhD in
art) and he was of a New Yorker of Jewish family I think, he ran a kind of
poetry club on Sundays where re I read -a also read at eth Nuyroican and a
few other places  -so - I also met some nice people near the Lower East Side
and a strange "disturbed" Russian guy an also an Italian bloke who read
poetry on TV  - what I liked about NY was the great mix of cultures and
peoples and all the diversity: the Irish pubs and the Italian places and the
Korean joints and the big Jewish delicatessen and so on - and this guy
(Webber or Weber?) went with me from the East Side to  Greenwich  - we
stopped in a (new books ) shop and he read from Steven's poem about Key
Point and later he and I got to his friends in Greenwich  where he and a
friend discussed American art - I didn't know as much of art as now know so
couldn't really join in much ) - we went around to a condom shop  - a shop
specialising in sex items!! and so on - I loved Washington Square....

For me yes the sight of the Jews in caps was a bit strange - as it was to
see cops with guns and a lot of homeless rattling cups (usually those
polystyrene cups) but it was part of the scene (I even got to know a
homeless black guy who wrote for the "Homeless People's" Newspaper - I used
to drink in a baron 47th and "wrestle and exchange raillery with back guys

I am Jewish (the truth)

Jew IS a dirty word.

I have lived in Israel and on a Kibbutz (truthfully)

The conditions were dangerous. The Kibbutz was near a Palestinian settlement
from which terrorists crossed the border into the Kibbutz and had shot and
killed people living on the Kibbutz.

I have also lived in Monsey New York studying the Talmud with ultra-orthodox
Chassidic Jews.

I celebrate Hanukah. My wife is not Jewish. She is Japanese. So we also
celebrate Christmas.

In elementary school I was called a dirty Jew and it was the first time and
last time I have ever threw a punch at someone.

The Zionist Jews in Israel and the Chassidic Jews in Monsey New York are a
different kind of Jew than I am.

Jewish identity has many different meanings to many different people.

The issue is not complicated.

What is complicated is how people entrench themselves in an identity that is
in conflict with the identity of someone else.

That's all.

All the rest of the talk is venting and ideology.

Humorous poetry is fiction, just like other artistic endeavors, and
uses a wide variety of techniques, including unfair caricature,
exaggeration, even outright falsehoods, to create layers of meaning.
It is as much a mistake to say that this poem, which mocks not merely
the French bureaucracy (and who >invented< bureaucracy, eh?), but the
whole notion of official terror levels, and the deadpan style of news
reportage, to mention a few, is "stupid" or "sick" as it is to say
that the prose stylings of free versists, dressed up in odd
lineations and unwarranted claims, are merely prose stylings dressed
up in odd lineations and unwarranted claims.

Stalin, that great friend of the Jews, established a Jewish homeland on the
Pacific coast of Siberia. Churchill proposed a Jewish homeland in Uganda
(nicer climate, tho). Both were seeking answers to what came to be called
The Jewish Question or the Jewish Problem after the onset of Romantic
nationalism, with its focus on ethnic exclusivities. Question, Problem,
would seem to have demanded a Solution.

Myself, it seems to me that the utter devastation of much of Europe after
WWII created an opening for restructuring European ethnic separatism, as it
in fact has in many countries (and see, for instance, the establishment of
the EEU, one of the few things that have made me at all hopeful for the
human race, despite its flaws, despite Bosnia and Kosovo)--a European
solution to a European problem. Which for a lot of European Jews would have
been an incredibly sad alternative--living among the bloodstains and
memories, and the unshakeable insecurity--but for me would have been more
in keeping with my own sense of the relentlessly diasporic nature of
European Jewishness, which gave it its vitality but also made it so vulnerable.

We invented Romantic longing, building it into not only the culture but the
religion. Even childrens' toys--I'm thinking of the Hanukah dreydl, with
its four letters as acronym for "a great miracle happened there." Or the
salutation "next year in Jerusalem." In Israel the dreydl now says "a great
miracle happened here," and I for one won't go to Jerusalem or for that
matter to anywhere in Israel for as long as it continues to exacerbate the
very bad bargain imposed by Europe and by zionism on all the peoples there.
Which means I probably won't live long enough to go there.

Those powering the conflict, from Begin and before to Sharon, appear to be
motivated by the most secular of goals. Before the orthodox started calling
the West Bank Judea and Samaria the rationale for the settlements there,
and also in the Golan Heights, was that Israel needed them for security.
And the insecurity of Israeli life has led to the election of  these monsters.

Whatever I and others think of the history, the facts on the ground won't
go away. There are now two large populations with no place else to go. A
settlement would obviously be in the interest of both, tho its aftermath at
least for a couple of decades would probably be pretty messy. That
settlement could happen tomorrow if a second term US president with nothing
to lose and everything to gain for his party were willing to act. Israel
survives on US loan guarantees. Withdraw them until the settlements are
cleared and everyone's at the bargaining table and by the next election
Bush would be seen as the Savior of the Jews, a position that one would
think given the rhetoric of the religion he pretends to he would rather
relish. I'm not holding my breath.

I just read the very first message under "French
Terror Level" and find the last lines of this piece
quite limited in scope and even maybe ignorant: "And
then the final state/Of being for a French defender/Is
"Collaborate" (????)

I thought I would remind the author of the French
Resistance and of French people who fought against the
German occupation. . . .

Brigitte Byrd

De Gaulle, Jean Moulin and the Conseil National de la
Résistance.  In accordance with instructions from
London, Jean Moulin succeeded in bringing about a
separation between military and political action in
each of the Resistance movements. This was the
necessary preliminary to the creation of a "Secret
Army", formed from the merging of the paramilitary
formations of the southern movements, "Combat",
"Libération" and "Franc-Tireur", and the five
resistance movements in the northern zone,
"Organisation Civile et Militaire", "Libération Nord",
"Ceux de la Résistance", "Ceux de la Libération" and
the "Front National". General Delestraint agreed to
take command of these forces and placed himself under
the orders of General de Gaulle who had served under
him before the war.
At the same time Jean Moulin set up, under his own
direct control, two technical arms : the "Service des
Opérations Aériennes et Maritimes "(SOAM - Air and
Maritime Operations Service) which was later to become
the "Service des Atterrissages et Parachutages" (SAP -
Landings and Parachute Service) and the "Service
Radio" known as the WT. He also set up two other
bodies which would have a more political role : the
"Bureau d'Information et de Presse" (BIP), a
full-scale clandestine press agency under Georges
Bidault, and the "Comité Général d'Etude" (CGE -
General Study Committee), responsible for preparing
the administrative and legislative measures that would
be needed on liberation. Finally, Jean Moulin
succeeded in bringing together into a single National
Resistance Council, the "Conseil National de la
Résistance" (CNR), representatives of the eight
principal resistance movements, of the two trade union
groups (CGT and CFTC) rebuilt in secrecy and of the
six political parties or movements that had held
parliamentary seats under the 3rd Republic (the
Communist party, the Socialist party, the Radical
party, the Popular Democratic party, the Democratic
Alliance and the Republican Federation).

†Benoist, Robert (French Grand Prix race car driver)
Fled to Britain after the fall of France and joined
Special Operations Executive. Was captured by Gestapo
in August 1943 but managed to escape and return to UK.
Returned later to work with SOE agent Denis Bloch but
was arrested again in june 1944 and sent to
Buchenwald, where he was executed.

Bidault, Georges (French journalist and politician)
Became a POW after German attack until July 1941.
Moved to the unoccupied zone and joined the Liberte
resistance group (that later merged with Verite to
become Combat). He succeeded Jean Moulin as head of
the National Committee of the Resistance (CNR) in
1943. Represented the Resistance in the victory parade
down the Champs Elysees on the day after Paris was
liberated.

Boulle, Pierre (French author of Bridge on the River
Kwai fame). Was in Indochina when the War started and
joined the local army. After the fall of France he
joined the Free French Mission in Singapore and became
a secret agent under the name Peter John Rule. He
helped the resistance movement in China, Burma and
Indochina. Was captured by the Vichy French loyalists
in 1943 on the Mekong River but escaped from Saigon in
1944, and served until the end of the war in British
special forces.

Borel, Emile (French mathematician)
Was briefly arrested by Vichy regime after which he
begun to support Resistance.

Camus, Albert (French author) In a left-wing Parisian
resistance group called Combat that, alongside
sabotage and intelligence, published an underground
newspaper of the same name. Codename Beauchard. Wrote
many of his famous books during the war.

Cousteau, Jacques-Yves (French marine explorer)
Had been discharged from the navy before the war due
to disability. Spied for French resistance when
working with the creation of aqualung.

Eluard, Paul (French surrealist poet, born Eugene

(in which he had been imprisoned for spreading
left-wing propaganda) to join the army. After defeat,
tried to reach Paris by foot but was captured by
Germans and interned in Stalag XB POW camp. He was
later released because of ill health. Many Nestor
Burma stories are placed in German-occupied Paris.

Malraux, Andre (French author and politician)
Served in French tank unit and was captured during the
Western Offensive. Joined French resistance and
adopted a codename Colonel Berger afterwards. After
the liberation of Paris served in the Alsace-Lorraine

The Archive for New Poetry at the University of California at San Diego
is pleased to announce the publication of an online edition of
performance artist / poet Hannah Weiner's _Early and Clairvoyant
Journals_, edited by Patrick F. Durgin.  Although long recognized as an
influential text, the larger _Clairvoyant Journal_ project has never
seen the light of day.  This edition includes three of the four early
journals (excluding _The Fast_, which remains in print from United
Artists).  These early journals document the development of Weiner's
notion of "clairvoyance" as well as the literary form she became known
for in recent memory, "large-sheet poetry" (aka, "clair-style").  The
_Clairvoyant Journal_ itself is published in its entirety (181 pages in
length).  And all the texts are presented as high-quality scans of the
original typescripts, giving the reader the opportunity to appreciate
the visual impact of "large-sheet poetry."  Durgin's critical
introduction provides a new contribution to the growing list of
writings focusing on the considerable acheivement of Weiner's work in
the 1970s.

See, this is just the kind of assertion that indicates some kind of
loyalty
instead of figuring out the world. It is simply not true that the left
is soft on
all regimes except the Israeli one. The left rose up against Idi Amin,
for
example. The left was opposed to the apartheid regime in South Africa
(though
Israel supported it). The left was against the US-aided Pinochet
dictatorship
in Chile (though its secret police were trained by the Israeli secret
police).
In most parts of the world the left (and indeed the centre) is against
the US
imperialism. I have heard remarks such as the one I am referring to here
before, and they are as unuseful as saying that to be against the
Israeli
occupation is to be anti-semitic. But then I have heard Mordechai
Richler
called an anti-semite by a lot of Montreal Jewish organizations . . . .

Radio Turnbuckle

Destiny twinned and paid therapeutic counselors
like a human being getting better and doesn't bind people
or make them clean toilets. Very few people are free
and when one of them gets you you can look at it this way
somewhat. His religion is not taken away from him
and he's given financial help until just before
the beginning of the religion. He did know him
and taught him how to drive. They still held their jobs.

And never went back. They wouldn't allow them radios
and precipitated a great to-do, aware of the real
problems. Do you remember that? He'd had a lobotomy
and were worth their weight in gold and three
meals a day, exactly how they were used. Es-
pecially. I was teaching them how to live
and were faced with being sterilized, hopelessly
crippled, a clock hung around your neck. See it.

You were in perpetual humiliation all the time, how he
would ask astute questions. He was never attacked,
benevolent and all that great. His clay feet triumphed
all the time. Regardless of whether your column is syndicated,
exclusively written and very good to talk to
where there's self-interest at work, you have to
look at those things. An interesting thing is happening
and did not survive forced changing and transferring.

Liable for the defendant's costs, amongst the papers,
designed to cost money, and will constantly keep under
threat, he had a very interesting career. You'll have to bear
some of the costs. He was treated with kid gloves. Afraid of
the legend, he went to incorporate, allegedly high-class
and all in capital letters. Who had the snake? He's out of there
now. Did they escape? They still had a large facility. They
considered him a martyr and lost that one. He may well yet.

He's been sent and it really doesn't matter. I'll put it this way
to mobilize all the members against one another. They begin to
ferret out the most effective form of mind control, baring
your soul and its gets very aggressive. They enjoy
intimacy and everybody gets a turn. I managed to slide
and was just in for the darlingness at a weak moment
in a part of the whole process. This is very rough. It's so
hard and all-encompassing. Engineered to a degree, they left.

They had to go on and went through a stage. We do this
and then after that they forget it. You find out shortly
afterward. No, I haven't. I've seen so many people
absorbed and they gave remarkably convincing speeches
to try that first. They tend toward that sort of thing, refilled
with the good stuff and real informed decisions,
very involved with all sorts of symbols. Going through
a ritual again and again, they learned their therapeutics.

He remains permanently and they go there. They are made
dependent. I know someone. I know several people
who fall down a big step forward. It makes participation
more exciting. There's no such thing as an in-between if
it's all involved with poison. Everybody else was quoted. They
were battling Satan. A relation would never go into any
details. You move up first. It's what you know and it
is very hard for them. Your whole life is a problem.

A thrill from Christian Scientists can tell you one experience
if you leave it alone. I just can't. It's really fine. If
you are exactly the same, can I say the one thing
I'll be back to in a little while? I wouldn't be
thinking about it. Where is it coming from? Body
and soul have no foundation and have tumbled
from of old. When you take up the exact wording,
more will be seen. They talked about it and were lonesome

Richard,

This is a lot for me to take in. What I can say is that with my Jewish =
heritage I still look at other Jewish groups like any group (like the =
language poets group) as almost un-Jewish. It's like taking something to =
an extreme annhilates its substance. The non-religious Zionists I have =
lived with and the ultra-orthodox Chassidics I have lived with are =
Jewish people who have turned Judaism into a separatist group.

So they stand apart from other Jews. Like Language poets stand apart =
from other poets.

You are either with them or against them.

This is what starts wars.

Someone has to be right.

There is no compromise.

Someone has to win.

Then you have clerics who perpetuate the separatism, like language poet =
critics with blogs.

This is the poison, the partisan, separatist behavior.

It's always like this.

And it's based on the fear of surrendering your self-will to a higher =
power.

The religious clerics and the language poet blog critics try to =
appropriate the higher power into their self, thus becoming a dogmatic =
leader with a fanatical herd-consciousness group of followers who are =
too afraid to trust in themselves and need to give away their power and =
trust in an authority figure.

It's interesting to me how we are talking about poetry and being Jewish. =
And the parallels between Zionists, Ultraorthodox Jews and Language =
Poets. It's also interesting that the behavior of language poet leaders =
is not unlike the behavior of the leaders of the state of Israel.=20

It's interesting, and it's not surprising at all because this is human =
nature. To be devisive, to carve out a small territory and defend it =
against outsiders, or terrorists.

In the case of Israelies, they are holding onto land that belongs to =
everyone. Americans do not share "our" land with Native Americans who =
are a "sub-class" of human beings. And Israel does not share "their" =
land with the "sub-human" Palestinians.

It reminds me also of the MAG and how (when I was still involved in the =
daily operation of it) groups of poets would be offended when I would =
publish the work of poets from different groups in the same issue. Or =
poets who were indendent and unaffilated.

It's all about people being the same on a basic level, which is a simple =
fact. But how this simple fact is denied out of fear, and thus groups, =
sects, cells, bands - call it what you will - form and battle with each =
other, over who is right and who is wrong.

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    Insanity is doing the same thing over and over with the same people
    expecting things to turn out differently. By that reckoning, we are
    truly insane. We have been attempting to convert Euro-AmeriKKKans
    since we arrived on these shores. We have tried moralizing them
    despite their obvious immorality, we have attempted (just as abuse
    and incest victims do) to defend our tormenters in the false hope

    war, admit who our enemies are and act accordingly.

Junious Ricardo Stanton

It's Time To Try Something Different


The masses of Africans in AmeriKKKa appear to be so lobotomized and
demoralized there is no longer talk about challenging the white supremacist
hegemonic status quo. The only activity seems to be begging for acceptance,
validation or to be left alone by the very people who have engaged in
systemic
trans-generational violence, disenfranchisement and animus against our
ancestors and us. Africans have had "leaders/spokespersons" foisted upon us
who rarely challenge the status quo beyond superficial reformist
activities.
The conditions under which most Africans in AmeriKKKa labor have not
improved
significantly since the Civil Rights era. While the Voting Rights Act of
1964
did give blacks the right to vote in the South and has resulted in record
numbers of black elected office holders, the institutional racism existent
within the broader psycho-socio-economic milieu has not been
ameliorated. For
example the overall health of the African community is in crisis. We suffer
disproportionately from conditions such as clinical depression, diabetes,
cancers, hypertension, AIDS, fibroid tumors in women and a myriad of
autogenic
(generated from within ourselves) and environmentally induced diseases.
Despite numerous political gains, black politicians have been unable to
halt
or dismantle the environmental racism plaguing the black community. With
regard to the law, the courts, local, state and federal remain
adversarial to
the interests of black people. More Africans are incarcerated and more are
increasingly likely to be arrested, convicted and incarcerated than their
Euro-American counterparts. Financially a recent report showed the
wealth gap
between whites and people of color has widened tremendously during the Bush
administration. Assessing the landscape we are in deep trouble. You are
probably saying, "tell me something I don't already know".

In order to heal, one must first admit one is ill or suffering. We seem
to be
trying to anesthetize ourselves from our reality through substance
use/abuse
and escapist activities. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over
with
the same people expecting things to turn out differently. By that
reckoning,
we are truly insane. We have been attempting to convert Euro-AmeriKKKans
since
we arrived on these shores. We have tried moralizing them despite their
obvious immorality, we have attempted (just as abuse and incest victims
do) to
defend our tormenters in the false hope they will cease abusing us or
lighten
their maltreatment. It has not worked. We have attempted to champion their
system of economics and government, remember when Black Capitalism was the
vogue? Some even bought into Marxism and the pipe dream of a workers
revolution. AmeriKKKan history is replete with examples of trans-racial
populous movements that were ultimately sabotaged when the plutocrats
played
their omnipresent racial trump card. So how do we save ourselves? We must
first admit we are at war, admit who our enemies are and act
accordingly. We
are out manned and outgunned so we must use guile, cunning and formulate
tactics that create an infrastructure for ethnocentric survival and
transformation. Our short term goal is to make sure we stay healthy and
alive.
We have to educate ourselves about proper nutrition, develop psychological
coping skills to effectively navigate this hostile cultural terrain and
build
institutions and systems that will strengthen and empower us
psychologically,
socially, economically and politically. This is nothing new, Pap Singleton,
Marcus Garvey Noble Drew Ali and Elijah Muhammad showed us how to do
this. We
have to pick up the baton and continue running the ethnocentric race. We
have
to restore the family as the primary socialization mechanism. We must
use the
stable family (no matter the form the operative word here is stable) as the
psychological base and economic hub to teach thrift and cooperative
economics
by starting savings clubs, credit unions and food co-ops for our
families and
neighborhoods. We must support organizations like the Black Farmers and
Agriculturalists Association who have our best interests at heart. In
short we
must take a proactive, ethnocentric approach rather than maintain our
present
pathological exocentric, dependent/subservient condition. It will take a
different approach, doing things differently and using our minds in a whole
new way. This is the broad scope; how it will look or work in your family,
neighborhood and region is up to you to decide. If we want things to be
different tomorrow than they were yesterday, we will have to do something
different today.

 I am sure that Genet was well aware of the nunance between anti-arabism and anti-semitism. He pointed out in an essay written in 1970 that Europeans became anti-Arab at just around the time the Jews no longer lived in Europe. As they had before the Shoah. How simple and convenient for Europeans to switch their hatred to another group of outsiders who are a Semitic people. One has to add that Genet wrote those words after witnessing first hand the horrors that the Tshal had inflicted either directly or indirectly on Palestinians and other Arabs.  The late Edward Said writes that being antiSemitic and antiArab amouts to pretty much the same thing. The paranoia toward others is always the fuel on which racism and hatred are built. Genet of course, speaking as one who loves the Palestinians is the first to admit (in Prisoner of Love his last work) that his point of view arises out of the blindness of his love, and his identification with the Palestinains as a landless people. Or
  in
 DeleuzoGuattarian terms, as a people who were literally deterritorialized to become the new Jews of the Levant. As one Palestinian man tells an American Palestinian who is visiting Jerusalem, "Go to Gaza the Bride of the Arabs, See , see what the children of the victims of the Nazis are doing."

Blood spilled on both sides day and night

decade after decade

the cry of Empire in their skulls

One thinks of Rachel Corrie and others who cross the line to change real circumstances, or Amira Hass who lives in the West Bank daring to do what few Isarelis doing and writing as she does, and other decent Israelis who seek, like their fellow Palestians only a space for themselves to live their lives. So these harbingers of peace, and justice, courage and ethical conduct inspire hope  for life and not death . Decent men and women from both communties seeka vocabulary of peace, One thinks of the late Faisal Husseini and others so many unknown teenagers standing strong against tanks and jets, and drones, bombs, decades of defeat, and destruction.Edward Said's son working as a human rights lawyer and so many others, so many Palestines in so many days.

I can see the parallels but I dont think that the langauge poets - or the
situation of them is as drastic  (but in gerneral it is true tat the poetry
world kind of fragments into groups - and I am in a smallish group (perhaps
not correct to say I am in a group like being in a club but I am of a few
peopel who are friends but that group of us isnt very large) here of writers
who - actually the original group were "followers" of Alan Loney and he was
in turn influenced by Olson and Creeley and to some extent the language
poets - the situation is complex - but always - as my friends the poet
(Leicester Kyle ) says-- there are always gate keepers - wherever you go.
Thus he self publishes his various projects but he knows that he has to
enter the round and sends stuff of to various mags (as well) - I kind of
"roll with  punches" (but I dont send much out at the moment -and busy
trying to make money etc - but personally I learnt alot from thealnguage
poest and still do -butkeep my options open - the Mag that just published me
(Brief) accepts fairly wide style of stuff: but trys to be  - what -
innovative I suppose.

I accept that their arre various religious and racial groups and so on - I
personally am an individualist quasi-Marxist  - Marxism in small doses I
find useful but its only one idea. Although I have no religion - have never
really been to a church (unless for funerals etc) - I beleive there has to
be some meaning or something out there so to speak or in all things - I like
Wordsworth's ideas on that - his poems.  Of course I like many other poets
of many kinds and styles..shy away from being too much in any camp myself...
I dont worry about the Langpos they are not all that hegemonic: and theya nd
htsoe influeced by them have onde some incredible sytuff - tat said there
are oter ideas going on - Alan eg lies somewhere in between - somewhere!!

Cheers.

For a list I thought was about poetry, there's an awful lot of talk
about politics here. When your discussion becomes more politics than
poetics, isn't it time to take your discussion elsewhere?

A Present For Daddy

When I was a little girl my father had a pipe
and the tune it played was Gallagher's Rubbed-Out Rich Dark Honeydew.

At nearly-Christmas every year
we'd go with our mother to the small brown shop

with the bright glass cabinets and dark wood counter
where the air smelled of honey with liquorice breath,

and we'd say very carefully - If you please
we want Gallagher's Rubbed-Out Rich Dark Honeydew.

And all Christmas long that rich brown scent
would mingle with the smells of turkey and pudding

and our noses would be joyful too.

When I was a little girl my father had a pipe
and the tune it played was

Gallagher's Rubbed-Out Rich Dark Honeydew.

Winter is hazardous.  The world around my house is a sheet of ice,
scattered with thin, dry snow.   Windows bloom with frost, birch
branches bare on the other side.  I stay indoors, still stiff and sore
from a fall two days ago.  The dogs beg for a walk; they will not have
one.  Yesterday, the river complained, groaning beneath its
ice-spotted skin.  Ducks huddled together on stones above the surface.

            even the moon
            a shard
            of  ice

Yes. The problem is that there has always been a 'Jewish Question' - you
find it explicitly in Marx, Dostoevsky, all through the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries - to the extent that Lyotard, Levinas, Blanchot,
Derrida - it con/figures in all of them. When I was living in Montreal
1980 - during the referendum - there it was again. Zola counters Dreyfuss,
and in one way or another it's central to Pound, Wells, Orwell, Eliot,
WCW, a host of non-Jewish writers; Kristeva takes it up as well. For some
of us, at least for me, many of these writers are primary sources. There's
also the problematic of Kerouac and Jones' attitudes re: the beats - in
relation to Ginsberg. Over and over again.

It's an aporia that in a very deep way has nothing to do with Israel.
'Jew' is highly overdetermined. So it makes sense to discuss it here - but
I don't think the discussion has been particularly fruitful - if at all.
On one hand there are daily politics - on the other there are the deeper
undercurrents, as well as Sartre's notion that if the Jew didn't exist,
he'd have to be invented. Sartre's book itself is a painful read. Gilman
in jewish Self-Hatred untangles a lot of this. It's necessary to look at
it again - for example Damon on Gertrude Stein.

All of which is of little comfort - as is the fact that so many 'thinkers'
of the last two centuries (Wittgenstein, Levi-Strauss, Derrida, Freud,
Marx, Einstein, etc.) have been partially-assimilated Jews with difficult
relationships both to Judaism and Europe.

All these interrelations are discussed somewhat in an odd book by Cuddihy,
years ago, The Ordeal of Civility. I know I continue to draw from the
work, even though I haven't read it in a while.

So I think this issue _is_ central to at least some literature and some
theory - but I would hope for a very different kind of discussion - one
not going on about what I still see as the stupidity as equating jews with
israel with zionism with whatever. That's like equating Jimmy Breslin with
the Pope - as far as I'm concerned, a derailing.

The rest, the other questions, continue to fascinate and hold me, which is
why, yet again, I'm reading job - an incredibly complex palimpsest that
doesn't resolve at all the way I 'remembered' it.

- Alan

The Book of Brueckl  Part 2


reassembled heads circulating
around the savage robin's egg blue sky: tattered flashes:
Simultaneously sutured sparks cleave sieved, not at all:
falsetto shadows liquefied, flattened out--joyousness
subtracted: it is eaten: scathes: chasms of Jesse, gradual
green atrocities sharply melting madrigals: flames of
eternity's cells stoking the unreal: outside, the boneyard
dew: Imprinted, foreshadowed, decaying in the rut uncurls,
apparently subcutaneous in collusion with an apparent
interruption, leaning on the resemblance, the footstools of
the text, the apotheosis of sounds, the grinding cavity, the
root of radioactive words of morning's bedewed pistache,
nestled pallor, compressed circumstances in solitude,
heaving vulgarly: disclosed differences between repeated
hoarding stuns resemblances, unimaginable words' hard glow,
never insolvent, always wafting aeration: here, blurred,
striated: to afflictions of impure identity of a pale
footnote to the periphery of a bride's hourglass: disjointed
autumn's sticky colors, precisely quiet, soiled blond ink:
Hole artifice, reassembled heads circulating around ruptured
acolytes milking arpeggios, barely dusk in the length and
fro, synthetic branches of night transcend the outrages of
love: felt odor's chilly omission, very nearly this
difference between breaths, raveling speech stranded inside
the reluctance of possessiveness inflicted on the beyond:
bluntly belied, stirring: imbibe: elbow murmur, insect twine
braided under the rim of pleasure fatigued, the footstools
of memory discern your wrist: it is: no one can be thistle
protuberances, sawdust of night's nest, edible routed ear,
neck signature dinged and relighted impatiently, dead
paradise's arc doomed: can see: it was in this is never, I
peed some icky stuff on sheaves of abating mud:
perpendicular, disjunction flesh: they came with the savage
robin's egg blue slanting softness, demented, a gaggle of
breath fiercely glimpsed, displaced not that reeks of joy,
swerving moments transcended, gradually diminished: ah,
wounds glowing, trickling sludge, starlight's instants in
denial, induced stares lightening desire: pentagonal tongue
collapsing: repeated hoarding stuns resemblances,
unimaginable words' bosoms' bones, diminishing gradually
diminished: ah, wounds glowing, trickling in, musky:
abandoned faucet: immense, whenever it can be: not to the
skin of shrunken tenses, betrayed handwriting of radioactive
words of malversation: will they came with disgust along the
felt odor's chilly omission, very lonely: cursive stuff on
the corrosive hours, brittle pretexts bickering: I, too,
debilitated: intense sheer lines leap: wrinkled mechanisms
attaching themselves to be there hourly, naturally stripped
in adoration, coming from the instant is disturbed,
retracted, tainted, inversely multicolored, exposed: a wet
arrangement, plainly buffeted crevices, embellished
parentheses, plain forgetfulness: Dourness tinkles, affected
by it: asking not at all: it can see: it could be opposed to
tutelary irises, speechless as it is an apparent
interruption, leaning on codicils beforehand: muffled
compunction: what about it: asking not there: perquisite
eucalyptus, magnolia, raffia, ilex, berry, aigrette,
pheasant feathers, shimmery butchery, barbed mish-mash
within the nakedness of wounds, hollow gloss of radioactive
words contaminated: crimson nails' defunct glowing,
trickling sludge, starlight's instants in this voice
perfectly pulsating and perpendicular bosom, spirals' pangs,
listening seeds: dead ache seen as it could be not to and
emptiness suffocating while disadumbrating the impure
identity of wet light: shrinking subterfuge, leaping off
branches bending low dosages of tangled flaws' germination
drainage, corpses of aloes arising: squandered stag rusted
hollow, nuanced, tilted down, grasping, curling: welded
drone receding, lilacs in a jagged meadow thirsting for
confetti, the curving seizure of trickling sludge,
starlight's instants in tattered breath trajectories
hardened particularly to see the corrosive hours, brittle
pretexts bickering: I, too, dislike Satan's semen: blushing
shoals leaning on the square root of stinking whispers
puffing, ulcered, coming to difficult eruptions, only hollow
rectilinear arrowheads under the spacious factory, in
collusion with kisses: sullen diamonds winking, smeared
spatters renamed light sign of being cautiously questioned,
quietly winking auscultation: salubrious bib of the damp
antennae eluding the throbbing disturbances of malversation:
will they know peeling window panes, starlights' mnemonic
blooms: the quarry of gravity: when rambling brackets of
monotony swells like vocabulary, coalesced turd colorings
signature: voiceless sap dust oozing indistinctly, and
breadth of unmeaning numbers often limpid, very comfortingly
unintelligible: which is disturbed, retracted, tainted,
inversely multicolored, exposed: a bride's hourglass:
disjointed autumn's sticky colors, precisely quiet, soiled
blond ink: Hole artifice, reassembled heads circulating
around ruptured acolytes milking arpeggios, barely a jagged
meadow thirsting for confetti, the core, aghast: branches of
antiquity, revealing lead pencils shedding angles, oftener
sublime light's thicket,

This is an interesting question.

What is the difference between poety and politics?

I am aware that beneath every literary work I produce their exists a =
political motive.

So maybe you might want to consider that it's not so surprising that =
politics is being discussed in a poetry forum.

Perhaps we are searching for what motivates us to produce literary work.

Perhaps we are examing ourselves indirectly by discussing politics.

It would be a more honest discussion if we discussed our own personal =
politics that move us to write what we do and publish what we do.

For myself, I am always trying to stir things up and to one-up the =
old-school poets on this list.

I do this because of my personal experiences with them in person and =
through email correspondence.

The old-school poets on this list live in a very different world than =
the world I live in.

It's generational.

They are like my parents.

My parents admire me but they are also threatened.

My parents need to maintain parental control, even though I am 47 years =
old.

Some old-school poets on this list are even more old-world than my =
parents. They act more like my grandparents who were from eastern =
europe, some escaping the holocaust and some not.

Politics has a very intimate side to it.

I believe that is why many are discussing politics here.

Because of its intimate side.

Poetry also being intimate.

The nonconstructive way politics is discussed is that it is always being =
directed away from oneself, always being projected onto someone else.

We all have our political agendas. We can't help it. We can try to be =
better than this level of politicking. But it's hard.

What's good to know is that poetry without politics is what poetry =
really means.

Maybe this is another reason why politics is being discussed a lot.

Maybe many people on this list are wondering about their =
political/poetic selves and looking for a way out of the politically =
motivated, side of themselves.


August

Jackson Mac Low, 82, Poet and Composer, Dies
By MARGALIT FOX

Published: December 10, 2004


Jackson Mac Low, a poet, composer and performance artist whose work reveled
in what happens when the process of composition is left to carefully
calibrated chance, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan.
He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.

The cause was complications of a stroke that he had last month, according to
the Academy of American Poets, which announced his death.

The author of more than two dozen books of poetry, as well as musical
compositions, plays and multimedia performance works, Mr. Mac Low was a
seminal figure in the American experimentalist movement of the 1950's and
after. A founding member of the avant-garde group Fluxus, he collaborated
frequently with the composer John Cage. In recent years Mr. Mac Low often
worked with his wife, Anne Tardos, a poet, artist and composer.

What united Mr. Mac Low's output was a fascination with randomness and with
the limitless combinatorial possibilities of language.

"The sense of words as being primarily in a circumstance that's limiting -
sentencing them to sentences - he did not take kindly to that," the poet
Robert Creeley said in a telephone interview yesterday.

Mr. Mac Low's poems, like his musical compositions, did not so much blur the
boundary between language and music as render it invisible. He prized words
not simply for their meaning (he worked as an etymologist as a young man)
but as movable fragments of pure sound.

Sprung from their sentences, shuffled and reassembled, Mr. Mac Low's words
became layered acoustic collages, meant to be performed aloud. Constantly
shifting, always evolving, rarely the same twice, his poems laid bare the
machinery of poetry-making itself.

In Mr. Mac Low's work, structure depended on chance. He composed some poems
by shuffling index cards containing words and phrases. For others he used
random-number tables and, in later years, computer programs.

Some sprang from a roll of the dice. "7.1.11.1.11.9.3!11.6.7!4.,a biblical
poem" was the first in a cycle, begun in the mid-1950's, that was rooted in
the Hebrew Bible. The poem comprises not only words (spoken aloud by one or
more performers) but also rhythmic silences (represented by "/__ /").

Mr. Mac Low prefaced the poem with two pages of instructions describing the
various possibilities for reading it. (The title represents the number of
words and silences in each line, which he determined with dice.) When read
aloud by multiple performers, each going at a different pace, the poem
evokes the wash of murmuring of Orthodox Jews at prayer.

Jackson Mac Low was born in Chicago on Sept. 12, 1922. After receiving an
associate's degree from the University of Chicago in 1941, he earned a
bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College in 1958. He was awarded a Guggenheim
Fellowship in 1985 and in 1999 received the Wallace Stevens Award, which
carries a $100,000 prize, from the Academy of American Poets.

Mr. Mac Low's first marriage, to Iris Lezak, ended in divorce in 1973.
Besides Ms. Tardos, whom he married in 1990, he is survived by two children
from his first marriage, Mordecai-Mark and Clarinda, both of Manhattan, and
one grandchild.

His other work includes "Two Plays: The Marrying Maiden and Verdurous
Sanguinaria" (1999), "Pieces o' Six: Thirty-three Poems in Prose" (1992) and
the CD "Open Secrets" (1993).

In a 1999 lecture, Mr. Mac Low described what he called his "ways of
working."

"They are almost always ways in which I engage with contingency, and in
doing so I am often, to a large extent, 'not in charge' of what happens
while I do so," he explained. "They often surprise me, and they almost
always give me pleasure and seem to give pleasure to others."

Unmanifest

What the maker of a manifesto does not comprehend or acknowledge
is the basic unmanifestness from which and within which each manifes-
tation takes place. It is this neglect or ignorance that calls forth repug-
nance  when a manifesto is proclaimed or published, especially one
regarding art. As if what comes to being in and as the work of  art
could ever be totally manifest or even manifest at all without its abiding
steadfastly in the unmanfest! A work of art is a manifesto only insofar
as it is its own antimanifesto.

and along the lines of what alan is proposing, i also think it worth
this list's while to have a close look at marjorie perloff's memoir,
~the vienna paradox~... fascinating autobiographical discussion, and
intellectual history, of some of these issues from (imho) one of our
leading critical lights...

best,

Lookin for Bird en Dizzy
Heard the trumpets shoutout as free en wyel as Bilal.
Some got lost on the corner
Where a 50yr old held rocks en rigs in his pocket
Who'd shoot kids up for 15 bucks a pop
Some felt too ashamed to carry on en show themselves to Gawd
Who they felt would be embarrassed to know them

Mi nekga More nutty en shu wont to die.  I believe the Sun en moon will

realized he saw he listened en tried best to hear thét the only ones who
fight are the scripture pretty'd Islamic noblemen tannedup/Blackedout
F.O.I.'s movin in pertetual prayer. The only one's to give each one

Thét La Raza believe in 13 reasons -- so let thét groove right. En all

No, he en his waddys could be here, like there, jus like they are alla,

some speculative thoughts, and questions ...

Jalal Toufic, in his December 2 lecture at CCAC in San Francisco, =
touched
briefly on the filmic concept of the "imaginary line." The imaginary =
line is
the virtual line in space that connects, for instance, two speakers who =
are
having a dialogue, where the footage cuts back and forth between =
close-up
reaction/response shots of each speaker's face. Narrative film depends =
on
such edits and cuts, along with our mind's ability to resolve these =
apparent
discontinuities into a continuous space or story. Toufic's own work
(_Vampires, An Uneasy Essay on the Undead in Film_
http://www.postapollopress.com/Vampires.html) also depends heavily on
experiences of spirtual/metaphysical/ontological discontinuity, which I =
feel
some personal affinity with. After the lecture, I began to play with the =
idea
of relating the imaginary line to empathy. It is not only our cognitive
resolution that connects two actors on screen who are separated by edit =
cuts,
but also the empathy between the actors during the performance (at least =
I
believe the core connectivity of this empathy stays intact in good =
cinema, as
in Almodovar films, and is not solely "constructed" on the splicing =
table),
as well as our audience-level empathy for the characters. Okay. Then I
started thinking about so-called "universal" poets, like Rumi and Rilke =
--
(for lack of a better term I'm using "universal" to describe the wide =
appeal
that these poets seem to have). Their poems too are projects in =
discontinuity
-- discontinuous images, sensations, quick jumps, abrupt changes in =
state &
scene. Yet readers can bridge these discontinuous gaps without a great =
deal
of poetry-reading experience or training. Is this because the =
discontinuous
experiences presented in these poems are in fact selected points on the
imaginary line of continuous empathy? Is discontinuity in this case the
visible subset of a usually hidden plane of continuous empathy?

Ron Silliman, in his November 18 blog entry
(http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_ronsilliman_archive.html),
compares his own poems to the disjunctive experience of riding a city =
bus.
Quick paraphrase: When one gets off a crowded bus and steps onto a =
deserted
street corner, the scene change is abrupt and jarring; everyday =
contemporary
life is composed of similarly discrete, discontinuous experiences; =
multiple
discrete experiences do cross each other and overlap, so that one learns =
to
navigate the simultaneity of the multiple; real quotidian experience =
(and
neurocranial thought) is composed of pulses rather than flows, particles
rather than waves; thus "stream of consciousness" is a wrongheaded =
device,
based on the artifice of a theory rather than the realism of =
phenomenological
life. Elsewhere in his blog, Silliman has noted the significance of =
spaces in
his New Sentence works, i.e., the space or pause between the period =
ending
one sentence and the first word beginning the next sentence. As =
compositional
units, these pauses are as significant (if not more significant) than =
the
sentences that mark the "material substance" of the poem, because the =
pauses
represent the decision points where pulses of discrete thought veer off =
in
one direction vs. another? These pauses are also where the (open) =
reading of
a piece is concentrated. So if the New Sentence poem is a realist =
product of
discontinuous consciousness, and if the space or pause in the New =
Sentence
poem holds the concentration of both compositional and reading energies, =
then
does a kind of passage open up, through the site of the pause, between =
author
and reader? And does this passage between author and reader, via the
unoccupied spaces marking the cuts in discontinuous pulses, resemble an
imaginary line?

Lisa Robertson, in her 2003 book _Occasional Work and Seven Walks from =
the
Office for Soft Architecture_ (http://www.clearcutpress.com/), calls for =
a
closer look at the surfaces of buildings, garden accessories, fountains,
interior wall paint, furniture, and various other "feminine" artifacts =
that
ornament, adorn, and otherwise dress up the hard architecture of
stone/wood/concrete/steel/glass enclosures and civic structures that =
function
as monuments to idealized states of permanence. By contrast, the =
decoration
of soft architecture offers continuous evidence of ongoing transience,
cultural shifts, decay. The transience of soft architecture is what
commemorates the mortal and bridges the distance between the (mortal) =
person
and the (immortal) civic ideal. What makes this book so extraordinary to =
me
(as an essay, a poem, a manifesto of post-fin de siecle hopes and =
desires) is
the way Robertson's prose invokes the lyric with swift juxtapositions of
sentences that flicker back and forth between the actual and the =
possible,
the spatial and the speculative. Certainly the imagination (as inspired =
by
the city's soft surfaces) does much to fill the discontinuous gaps that
trouble the individual's smooth transition into the collective life of =
the
polis. Is this trouble tantamount to the stab of pain that provokes the =
lyric
into being?

In general, does the interplay between continuous and discontinuous =
elements
structurally signal a movement towards transformative change,
emotional/spiritual/political? And does the writing of discontinuity =
(abrupt
lyric verse, the aphorism, sentence composed outside the linear =
narrative
tradition) nevertheless lean toward a utopian continuity on some level, =
even
if this utopia is meant to dangle perpetually in the future subjunctive?

Pam,

This discontinuities are also in essence of surfing channels on T.V. In other
words, it seems to me, discontinuities are not per se good or bad; in
contemporary experience they are part of the "natural." In other words, the issue is
to arouse suspicions around this "natural condition," to defimiliarize its
"rightness." Ron's attitude to this issue is ambiguous, it seems to me. "Stream
of Consciousness" is a very different thing in "Ulysses" and in "Remembrances."
Stylistically, in Joyce, the result is often a fragmentation of sentences,
with the punctuation removed (the end of Ulysses). In Proust, it is an
elaborate, intricate flow, abolishing limits. Is Proust really inferior to Joyce? I
personally doubt it. Remembrances begings (the waking up section, waking to what,
what kind of waking?) where Ulysses ends (the moment before sleep).

Then, one has Benjamin's The Arcades Project, where absolute fragmentation,
differentiation is celebrated as a dream of childhood, in his terms as
Dialectical History. Is Ron talking about that?

I think people would say the same thing about Hafez--another Persian Sufi
mystical poet that people in the West have taken as "universal" in the sense
you mean--and while I must confess I am not sure entirely what you mean by
your question, I do think, if I understand what you are asking even
partially, that religious mysticism would have to answer yes and that this
hidden plane is the path towards/oneness with/etc. the divine. (I don't know
Rilke well enough to know whether he would fit into the same mystical
category as the other two.) But there is something else worth thinking about
here. The form that Rumi and Hafez wrote much of their best known work in,
the ghazal, is a form built on discontinuity: a series of discrete couplets
stitched together by a single rhyme that repeats over and over again until
the poem ends. In other words, the form itself depends on a reader's ability
to see the discontinuity between and among the couplets as somehow existing
in a context that also allows for them to be part of a coherent whole. Now,
I know that this element of the formal structure of Rumi and Hafez almost
never comes across in the more popular translations of their work--and even
translations that are more faithful to the original have a hard time coming
close to approximating the ghazal formally since monorhyme is a very
difficult thing to pull off well in English. Nonetheless, to the extent that
the original form can be understood as existing somewhere in the "deep
structure" of the translations I am talking about, it's worth thinking about
the extent to which a poem's formal properties contribute to the dynamic you
are asking about.

Murat,

I wouldn't want to get into a "value" competition between Joyce and =
Proust
either. I get something from reading each writer, and it's not the same
something. Though as I get older I seem to gravitate temperamentally =
more to
Proust, but that's more a mood than a value statement. Stylistically I =
think
of Proust as a Modernist who is very much in dialogue with the 19th =
century
tradition, in terms of extending the possibilities of the 19th century
European novel to its absolute limit. So prose-wise you get passages of
realist character & landscape description that are pushed to paratactic
extremes; plot-wise you get the classic outline of a young man's =
ambition,
rise, and disillusionment with fashionable society; even technology-wise =
you
have characters struggling with the transition into the information age, =
as
in telephones superseding the newsworthiness of written letters.

Joyce it seems to me was more consciously trying to signal a stylistic =
and
structural break with the 19th.

I've not read Benjamin's Arcades -- I'm intrigued. How does he go from
childhood dreaming to the historical dialectic? I'll have to add this to =
my
reading list...

best,
Pam=20

Here's a text that might speak to what Pam Lu just posted, but
from a slightly different vantage point.  It's from
"Devotional Cinema" by Nathaniel Dorsky (Tuumba, 2003)

konrad

PS A relevant plug: SF Cinematheque and The Poetry Center will
be showing a wonderful excerpt from a doc. Dorksy worked on this
Sunday at the SF campus of California College of Arts, Timken
Hall (where SPT has readings).  The sequences in question are
cut (according to these principles) to several archival
recordings of Keroauc reading from his books.  So you can judge
for yourself if Dorksy is on to someting....

Intermittence

"The quality of light, as experienced in film, is intermittent.
At sound speed there are 24 images a second, each about a 50th
of a second in duration, alternative with an equivalent period
of black.  So the film we are watching is not actually a solid
thing.  It only appears to be solid.

"On a visceral level, the intermittent quality of film is close
to the way we experience the world.  We don't experience a solid
continuum of existence.  Sometimes we are here and sometimes
not, suspended in some kind of rapid-fire illusion.  After all,
do any of us know *who* we actually are?  Although we assume
that we are something solid, in truth we are only experience and
maneuver through our existence.  After all can anything really
be solid?

"On close examination, even our vision appears to be
intermittent, which explains why, in film, pans often feel
artificial or forced.  This stems from the fact that one never
pans in real life.  In truth, when we turn our heads we don't
actually see a graceful continuum but a series of tiny
jump-cuts, little stills joined, perhaps, by infinitesimal
dissolves.  Thus our visual experience in daily life is akin to
the intermittence of cinema.

"Intermittence penetrates to the very core of our being, and film
vibrates in a way that is close to this core.  it is as basic as
life and death, existence and non-existence.  My own instinct is
that the poles of existence and non-existence alternate at an
extremely fast speed and that we float in that alternation.  We
don't experience the non-existence, the moments between
existence; there is no way to perceive these moments as such.
But in accepting their presence aerates life, and suffuses the
"solid" world with luminosity.

"A second aspect of intermittence has to do with the nature of
montage, the play of events or the narrative nature of our live.
This intermittence is part of our daily experience.  For
example, you might be driving your car and you mind wanders off
into thought, and six blocks, two red lights, and a left turn
later you return to you driving and think, "Who was driving? How
did i do that?  I stopped at red lights.  Where was I?"  In
other words, life is full of gaps.  We try to make the whole
thing seem continuous and solid, but it's actually more
intermittent than we often want to admit.  In a sense, for film
to be true, it has to trust this intermittence.  Its montage has
to present a succession of visual events that are sparing
enough, and at the same time poignant enough, to allow the
viewer's most basic sense of existence to "fill in the blanks."
If a film fills in too much, it violates our experience.

"We certainly know the shallow, sickening feeling of leaving a
film that has had no true respect for the intermittence of our
being.  Such a film does not respect what we know life to be, it
is not what we experience.  It is too solid.  It is an act of
rudeness."

Maria,

I'm back from Seattle . . . so to continue.  I agree with Aldon that this
sounds suspicious.  There is no question that the Mufti was friendly with
the Germans (remember: the British were occupying Palestine).  I doubt if
there were any conversations about final solutions -- since the Nazis did
not use that term publicly, and probably not with the Mufti (Arabs did not
rate much higher in the Nazi racial scale).

What? Poets don't talk about politics? Shouldn't talk of politics?
Politicians shouldn't write poetry?Are not we poets  part of the political
"spectrum" - it is arguable (not thereby provable of course) that poetics =
politics. Charles Bernstein and some of the other Language poets make a more
or less strong case for this view
language/poetics/politics/art/sociology/psychology ..everything is in
somehow connected.

There is no innocent language or poem /text etc - are there any innocent
poets?

Here is a chapter from L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Volume Four (Editors Bruce Andrews
and Charles Bernstein) and a previous essay has a contributor using the
phrase "the imperialism of the signifier".... Nick Piombino is in that issue
as well as Jackson MacLow, Barrett Watten,  Alan Sondheim.,...and others
innocent and or condemned (joking a little in my silly way...but they are
there!)

 [I walked into a second hand book shop about 1996 or 7 and asked if the
assistant if there was anything on poetry/poetics (he had some knowledge in
that area) and he said there was some writing on language by some American
poets  and I raced to the relevant shelves for the two volumes!! Couldn't
believe my luck -don't see that sort of stuff much here in NZ!]

 "The Political Economy of Poetry" by Ron Silliman.

And of course there is the (well known? ) quote from Loius Zukofsky  (Jewish
friend of the anti-Semite Ezra pound)

"Politics is what makes us human."

 Louis Zukofsky  (Letter to Ezra Pound 1962)

I agree with George Bowering on this.  What left are you talking about,
Alan?  Are you talking about the left in Israel?  I would say that, given
how serious the violations of international law Israel commits, Israel gets
very dainty treatment in the US (and I suspect in Canada as well), by much
of the left as well.  Are the Democrats the left (they are, according to
Fox)?  There was no significant difference between Kerry and Bush when it
came to supporting Sharon.  When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, there were
a million people marching against nuclear war and for peace in New York
City -- but organizers would not allow anyone to hold banners protesting
the war that was actually occurring at that time.  There was gag order on
speakers -- all to mollify pro-Israel elements.  Twenty years later many
anti-war organizers insist on linking the occupations of Iraq with the
occupation of Palestine, and some like  Michael Lerner of Tikkun
objecting.  Times have changed.  From my point of view it's been too long
before the American left began to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
and the US role in the Middle East.

hi all,

i'm not calling for a return to a moderated list, but i didn't sign up for a
poetics list to hear my fellow poets debate politics, no less arab-israeli
relations.

in other lists i've  been on in the past, when someone posted something
off-topic they put in the subject line "OT/" followed  by the subject. can
we at least do this?

best,
david

OK- so enough politics for a while- I think we are all in shell shock from
the 'victory' of our friend Peron-Bush.

Speaking of South America I just put up on Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com
profiles of 5 Brazilian poets I asked for more interviews but others were
tardy with their responses, I will put them up later. I have had the
pleasure however to translate all these interviews and be in dialogue with
these poets for the past month and it has been a joy, they bring up so many
things that Americans just dont care that much about. First off Brazilian
poets are very well read and on the whole the poet has a position of higher
status in Brazil in comparison to our wonderful Money republic.

So I am interested, Buffalo Listers, in how we can internationalize the
conversation here on the list I am interested in what all of you think about
poetry as a global artform and how we as poets in this milleu can dialogue
with poets from other places.  We will be doing Country Profiles in the next
6 months of Polish Poetry, Bengali Poetry, Italian Poetry and Chinese Poetry
and I hope that this dialogue continues to grow-

mi amigo,
akhi
I hope yuh feelin me
a go wreckin it up in yuh tardis
set trip
a go
set this
screw driver clapped to sonic
afrikan mathematic
plotted in ebonics
when they eyes get lynchy
givin props to what is

we crush a poet
his clic(k) and the liars
to infinity



= is this will embalm David A. K?
wr

a kite dave....

i'll bomb it in po etiquette


black writs, black flex, black flow, black testimony, black voice, what
others call poetry, is what is the struggle and the "roots to/of
resistance" against the  extended metaphor of the "west" and what it
calls politics a term condemned by my jamaican bruhs as "politricks".

politicks is the god of the west and the voting polls it's tabernacle
and temple -- the money, it's iconography -- the politicians it's
paramedic priesthood = its sanhendrin.

so the voice of those not privileged will always reflect/flex what the
privilege call "political" which is actually the roots of resistance and
the speaking of the TRUTH which is the light which burns vampires.

what makes the wicked uncomfortable and what makes them "invoke
authority" and resort to dirty tricks to silence the voice? -- this is
what the skill of aqil and right of what is "Sankofa" has been given to
us as tool to catch and crush vampire -- this is the path to our deep
concentration.

decalres as sisters b.u.t. watches as her white males rape and destroy
all Culture and family while breeding desease and grey and blues into

it was established, and god willing will remain that:

"one, god, one aim, one destiny"
--marcus garvey

will serve as the vehicle / tenor to combat the putsch.


here's a few notes:

Note: this is what challenges the left --the pure radicalism and
revolutionary foundation with the cornerstones of islam: "They want us
to redefine Islam to fit the agenda of the west," he intones, and the
audience murmurs. "Islam is going to be political, no matter how hard
they try. Islam itself is political. Allah has not remained silent when
it comes to political matters."--Islam itself is political

may i add so is what the dilletants wh call themselves poets miss that
what they call "peotry" is what they call "political" and it
DISassembles and DEstratifies.

Hi - wrote a reply re: this, and it was lost. To reconstruct - the
imaginary line also relates to the 180 degree rule, keeping the camera on
one side of the line - breaking this is a common technique of experimental
film as well as Godard, etc. For example, I made a film around 1973 called
'conversation' in which two people, talking intently, are filmed with the
camera shuffling positions; the result is both figures face the same
direction.

But for me this isn't empathy, but a parasitic apparatus - created
expressly for the viewer to comprehend 'the real,' since the viewer
doesn't do jump-cut, say the way Godard does. It's parasitic because the
film is constructed out of a filmic space as if the viewer were privy or
supplementary to what is occurring - this is taken for granted by
Hollywood narrative which tends towards the univeral reading, 'as if'
realistic.

So the line for me indicates an inauthentic construct, i.e. the reduction
of the real to a positioning or vanishing-point, just as a landscape is
never 'out there,' but positioned for viewing - hence the use of camera
obscura etc. etc.

The parasitic apparatus filters what's before it into the diegesis - i.e.
the narrative as constructed by the viewer; the line is of the viewer and
for the viewer.

It literally sutures discontinuous gaps in relation to the subject. It
creates an absolute reading, a whole, where there isn't one. Godard's
breaking - which is the absence of empathy - produces the idea of empathy
as false; one is never in another's skin.

I honestly don't think this has anything to do with the 'empathy between
the actors.' Teaching film - teaching these formalisms - in fact involves
the opposite - constant repositioning, stopping and starting, to give the
illusion of continuity.

i have been enjoying your http://www.chicagopostmodernpoetry.com/brazil.htm
page on brazilian poets. thank you.

allow me to recommend some great sites by brazilian writers/artists.

concerning internationalizing the dialog, it is important to be in contact
with poets who also are interested in internationalizing the dialog. the net
is a very good thing for international communications and being able to see
the work of other people from around the world. and the combination of
text/visuals/sound/interactivity etc sometimes make for work that is
'already translated'.

I said this:

And you, apparently in answer (because you quote the above), said this:

> Politicians shouldn't write poetry?Are not we poets  part of the political
> "spectrum" - it is arguable (not thereby provable of course) that poetics =

But it doesn't read like an answer:

"Poets don't talk about politics?" -- does not follow from original statement.

"Shouldn't talk of politics?" -- does not follow from original statement.

"Politicians shouldn't write poetry?"  -- does not follow from
original statement.

"Are not we poets part of the political "spectrum" - it is arguable
(not thereby provable of course) that poetics = > politics."  -- No
one said poets aren't political. No one said bus drivers aren't
political.

But you are correct in asserting that "everything is...connected."

We all live somewhere. It is arguable that we are all architects, that
we each create our architecture by being complicit in its design and
use, by allowing some buildings to be and other buildings to be
destroyed, by financially supporting one type of building and not
another. Let us chatter about architecture. We should use the list to
distribute pictures of our favorite buildings and to raise money for
our building development plans. I have a quagmire in Florida that you
may be interested in.

We all eat. We all are eaten. Eat or be eaten. Let's swap recipes. How
about pies for the holidays? I have a darling "Alaskan Snow Pie"
recipe.

We all have teeth. Let us talk dentistry. Everyone grin. _Now_. (You,
there. Yes, you. You have something caught between your upper left
cuspid and the adjacent lateral incisor. It appears to be a hair or a
bristle. A spine.)

We all are physicians or ought to be. The body is all we have, and the
mind, which is the body anyway. Want to see my bunions? Want to touch
my bunions? Aren't they smooth and warm? Often the first step in a
treatment plan, a normal, active life. Taping helps keep the foot in a
normal position, thus reducing stress and pain. I call them "Paul" and
"Babe".

We all wear shoes. We all are Jesus or have Jesus in our hearts or are
in the heart of Jesus, the heart of hearts, brethren, when we know it
not, hallelujah, amen, etc. We all drive or are driven. We all wash
clothes or have them washed for us. We all make sandwiches or choose
not to make sandwiches, and there is ham vs. peanut butter and jelly.
We all dance or should; those who do not should not be trusted. We all
breathe.

There are so many things to chatter about. Unfortunately, there are no
other places to talk of such things. It is such a sad, sad situation
-- when, oh, when will someone fix the internet? -- that there are all
these conversations we need to have, and only one place, this poetics
list, where all these conversations can be held. Simultaneously.

 No!  We can talk about poltics and poetics and dentisry anything you want -
my dentist  is related to de La Mare (that's his name) - a really alive
courageous mind doesn't see anything that is foreign to it - opposition to
"politics" is mostly from those who fear it or want to clamp down dissent -
not saying everyone (or amyone) does  but a lot are motivated by that on
oter discussion lists etc ..no? Maybe not -
but I suspect so...could be wrong.

 But think of Roland Barthes - what didnt he write about ? He wrote about
everything you talk of (eg in Mythologies - food, recipes, dentistry would
all have been potential subjects - the world and everything that is the
world is the subject of a poet.

There is a strong connection between poetics and politics - you conveniently
missed off my (brilliantly illuminating!) references to Ron Silliman
 Bernstein and how they discuss politics or did (until two legs became
good?)

 In fact Murat and I discussed this a  year ago - an important aspect of
poetics is in fact how it relates to poetics (and sociology, psych, popular
culture (and there you go - everything on your list and more) just about all
poetry is political -

 Ironically before S/11 (just befere S/11 happened I had decided to stop
reading the newspapers or watching television (totally - to see what it
would be like)) - I was almost completely unintersted in politcs - then
bang - my so rang me up - and whammo! - the greatest show on earth !!!)
(couldn't escape it here even in little  NZ) I was writing things such as my
RED  - I put  it on here once before - somewhere its on the archives  -
which was influenced by my first encounter with the language poets in 1992
also coming to see Stein (heer work startled me when I first had good look
at it - since 1992 I have read most of her work  - Stanzas in Meditations
is - well reading it ( I liken the experience to that of listening to Bach )
now those expereinces of Stein and so on - and first "encountering" the
Language poets - lead me (at 44 years) to write RED which I thought at the
time was totally non referential non political - had no messge  -was pure
poetry - and so on:

That said I realise that nothing is completely non referential and probably
the very lack of "politics" is a sign of a political stance or attitude etc

 The Red is on the archives of epc but I dont have it on my PC only on my
Amiga  - but I'll put this on -and you will see that - as such - it has not
a hint of 'politics' - here is a poem I wrote  a little later:


                                        Stepping

Stepping into the vanishing places you become ever more
visible, and some sort of utterance about almond blossoms, or
pine scent, creeps in, and is an ever more ascendant
resplendant more ever more fantastic thing like a wheel, in
whose motionless centre, surely nothing more everything has
been thought of Chinese more perpetual perpetual or
unperpetual could be found. Or was. All things - chroniclers,
characters, boots, bolts, old boats, or conversations whispered
in the hall - pour out the spat old book. That'll teach `em to
bible things. Getting nowhere, as is our wont, we won't. And
the p-pages flutter in the wind, leafing and briefing
themselves, while all the while the while, the demon-sized
head, shapes itself and crushes out the bolty magic: god or no god.



 That is in a book I did called RED but I chose it at random. now  -more so
than RED which goes somewhat like this  (I have friends ho know it off by
heart I cant do that - one pwoman ahws put it to music as a kind of song -
I have heard it:  Addendunm: I ve decided to type it all out as I will
 tansfer it to my PC now:



                               The Red

 The blocks of red on red on red by black around
 by black by black by line by line  by  round.   The
 red  in  red  of red in red where black by back the
 white around. Around the bound about the
 white the red more red comes up the red, It
 rears its head. The eye the see the sight to see.
 The eye the see the light the sight.

                      And light,

 The light not light not  bright not dim not sun.
The sun not round not up not down, The blue
not there not green not grey. The grey ungrey
not grey not black . The up not down the down
not up.

 And the black not black not black on night. The
 light  alight but light not light.

              The clock is dead.

The clock awake alive like head. The head like
blood like hot is red.

The squares  the slabs the reds  the blocks are
chops of chunks: the chunks the chunks the bits.
The monks.  And the  red the red and round the
black. (There is no black).

To you my red my square my thing:I fall
and  blubber  like   a   sun-struck   king.

The red on red of red the  blocks.   The orange
 the green the blue. The  see  the    the sight the
steel the grey. The shape  the tall  the  dark the
great. The  high the high.The finger like a finger
on the sky.

                   The eye the seen.

                    The green.

O my blocks my reds my reds my blocks: orange
is not is gnomes is gone.

 And  the  red  in  red.    (There is no red)
The square that's not that's never that's there.
If  red  be  red  not _is_ not  green:
Then red on red of red is you my thing. And
 if that is you by blocks by black are red around.
 And black is black as black is black.

               And red  is red is red.

I want to get this so that the stanzas are as rectangular as possible but it
is hard on an email.
I was influenced here by Stein etc and also maybe Beckett.  But at the time
and for some time afterwords - and largely still - I didnt want poetry that
"meant" things per se - I wanted poetry to be a kind of music - not a new
idea - but I was moving away totally from the idea of :mesages" of any kind
in poetry. Later  I was influenced by reading Trakl and Reverdy and poets in
Europe. I try to get  a German Egmlish edition etc as I dont have much
command of any langauge but English (but I love reading poems in German
French etc when I have a good translation beside them)....

 But back to the politics discussion - probably what I said before wasnt
much of an answer for you but I dont think that we should take potilics or
any other subject on your list list below elsewhere - to look at a poet I
just
got interested ( a bit more intensely than I had done before I mean) in a
few months back - Schuyler )_ I spotted a book on the NY poets and read a
lot of Schuyler's poetry again - one poem especially that I loved was 'The
Morning of the Poem' ; another was his Picnic Cantata  (made into an opera
by the
 way by Paul Bowles)
 ..but the point is these guys  - O'Hara - Ashbery Schuyler (esp) Elmsie,
Guest, Kenneth Koch and others (of course there is Ted Berrigan who was a
but later timewise) found everything a subject for there poems - "trivia"
is in The Morning of the Poem just as we get through its subjective flow (or
seeming subjective flow) certain moments of darkness and doubt enter in and
there is love and longing and fear and back to trivia and memories and so on
and so on. With Schuyler the right to talk deeply of felt love and what he
had for breakfast coexists brilliantly - off course we dont all want to talk
about breakfasts ! But we coud do - why not? - I see it all as potentialy
interesting  - despite your comical approach to it below - I dont mind that
 ... I see what you are getting at.

But look at the various poets on here - they are ful of politics, poetics,
and "trivia" of various kind - neither politics  or any oter subject
diminishes what they write.

I dont think we should separate politics out of the list (unless either the
Poetics Moderators or a largish majority want to abreak from overt
politics - my suspicion is that some who do are actually frightened of some
of the ideas  surfacing - I see it as healthy to voice what we are thinkng -
warts and all -  feet, Jesus, dancing, bunions, shoes , sandwiches....as
Louis Zukofsky said: " Politics is what makes us human"

 Who said "Life is a gigantic poem" ?

I don't know - but I DO know that I wrote "Richard Taylor's mind is like an
enormous ice cream" on the blurb of my very tatty Chapbook called "Singing
in the Slaugter House"

Richard Taylor.

John Ashbery's poem "In Those Days" is in the New Yorker.

Does anyone know if this is published in one of his collections?

Thanks in advance,
Deborah Poe


In Those Days
John Ashbery

Music, food, sex, and their accompanying
tropes like a wall of light at a door
once spattered by laughter

come round to how _you_ like it--
was it really you that approved?
And if so what does the loneliness
in all this mean?  How blind are we?

We see a few feet into our future
of shrouded lots and ditches.
Surely that was was the long one
to have come.  Yet nobody

sees anything wrong with what we're doing,
how we came to discuss it, here, with the wind
and the sun sometimes slanting.
You have arrived at this step, and the way down

is paralyzing, though this is the lost
youth I remember as being O.K., once.
Got to shuffle, even if it's only the sarcasm
of speech that gets lost, while the blessed
sense of it bleeds through,

open to all kinds of interpretations.

A poet friend woke up my day with the forward of this address by Bill Moyer=
s
on the environment as coupled with theology, rapture, etc. What makes this
interesting for me is the devil in the details. Wow.

Parenthetically - in a current moment where many of 'us' still seem to be
walking around in the daze from a 'technical knockout' called an election -
Signs of organization, resistance, public upheaval and rejection will be
welcome news to - I am sure - many of our ears.  I don't think we can take
this 'lying' down for the next 4 etc. years

     On Receiving Harvard Med's Global Environment Citizen Award
     By Bill Moyers
     t r u t h o u t | Perspective
     Wednesday 01 December 2004
     I accept this award on behalf of all the people behind the camera
whom you never see. And for all those scientists, advocates, activists,
and just plain citizens whose stories we have covered in reporting on
how environmental change affects our daily lives. We journalists are
simply beachcombers on the shores of other people's knowledge, other
people's experience, and other people's wisdom. We tell their stories.
     The journalist who truly deserves this award is my friend, Bill
McKibben. He enjoys the most conspicuous place in my own pantheon of
journalistic heroes for his pioneer work in writing about the
environment. His bestseller "The End of Nature" carried on where Rachel
Carson's "Silent Spring" left off.

     Writing in Mother Jones recently, Bill described how the problems we
journalists routinely cover - conventional, manageable programs like
budget shortfalls and pollution - may be about to convert to chaotic,
unpredictable, unmanageable situations. The most unmanageable of all, he
writes, could be the accelerating deterioration of the environment,
creating perils with huge momentum like the greenhouse effect that is
causing the melt of the artic to release so much freshwater into the
North Atlantic that even the Pentagon is growing alarmed that a
weakening gulf stream could yield abrupt and overwhelming changes, the
kind of changes that could radically alter civilizations.
     That's one challenge we journalists face - how to tell such a story
without coming across as Cassandras, without turning off the people we
most want to understand what's happening, who must act on what they read
and hear.
     As difficult as it is, however, for journalists to fashion a
readable narrative for complex issues without depressing our readers and
viewers, there is an even harder challenge - to pierce the ideology that
governs official policy today. One of the biggest changes in politics in
my lifetime is that the delusional is no longer marginal. It has come in
from the fringe, to sit in the seat of power in the oval office and in
Congress. For the first time in our history, ideology and theology hold
a monopoly of power in Washington. Theology asserts propositions that
cannot be proven true; ideologues hold stoutly to a world view despite
being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality. When
ideology and theology couple, their offspring are not always bad but
they are always blind. And there is the danger: voters and politicians
alike, oblivious to the facts.
     Remember James Watt, President Reagan's first Secretary of the
Interior? My favorite online environmental journal, the ever engaging
Grist, reminded us recently of how James Watt told the U.S. Congress
that protecting natural resources was unimportant in light of the
imminent return of Jesus Christ. In public testimony he said, "after the
last tree is felled, Christ will come back."
     Beltway elites snickered. The press corps didn't know what he was
talking about. But James Watt was serious. So were his compatriots out
across the country. They are the people who believe the bible is
literally true - one-third of the American electorate, if a recent
Gallup poll is accurate. In this past election several million good and
decent citizens went to the polls believing in the rapture index. That's
right - the rapture index. Google it and you will find that the
best-selling books in America today are the twelve volumes of the
left-behind series written by the Christian fundamentalist and religious
right warrior, Timothy LaHaye. These true believers subscribe to a
fantastical theology concocted in the 19th century by a couple of
immigrant preachers who took disparate passages from the Bible and wove
them into a narrative that has captivated the imagination of millions of
Americans.

     Its outline is rather simple, if bizarre (the British writer George
Monbiot recently did a brilliant dissection of it and I am indebted to
him for adding to my own understanding): once Israel has occupied the
rest of its 'biblical lands,' legions of the anti-Christ will attack it,
triggering a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon. As the Jews who
have not been converted are burned, the messiah will return for the
rapture. True believers will be lifted out of their clothes and
transported to heaven, where, seated next to the right hand of God, they
will watch their political and religious opponents suffer plagues of
boils, sores, locusts, and frogs during the several years of tribulation
that follow.
     I'm not making this up. Like Monbiot, I've read the literature. I've
reported on these people, following some of them from Texas to the West
Bank. They are sincere, serious, and polite as they tell you they feel
called to help bring the rapture on as fulfillment of biblical prophecy.
That's why they have declared solidarity with Israel and the Jewish
settlements and backed up their support with money and volunteers. It's
why the invasion of Iraq for them was a warm-up act, predicted in the
Book of Revelations where four angels 'which are bound in the great
river Euphrates will be released to slay the third part of man.' A war
with Islam in the Middle East is not something to be feared but welcomed
- an essential conflagration on the road to redemption. The last time I
Googled it, the rapture index stood at 144-just one point below the
critical threshold when the whole thing will blow, the son of god will
return, the righteous will enter heaven, and sinners will be condemned
to eternal hellfire.

     So what does this mean for public policy and the environment? Go to
Grist to read a remarkable work of reporting by the journalist, Glenn
Scherer - "The Road to Environmental Apocalypse." Read it and you will
see how millions of Christian fundamentalists may believe that
environmental destruction is not only to be disregarded but actually
welcomed - even hastened - as a sign of the coming apocalypse.
     As Grist makes clear, we're not talking about a handful of fringe
lawmakers who hold or are beholden to these beliefs. Nearly half the
U.S. Congress before the recent election - 231 legislators in total -
more since the election - are backed by the religious right. Forty-five
senators and 186 members of the 108th congress earned 80 to 100 percent
approval ratings from the three most influential Christian right
advocacy groups. They include Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist,
Assistant Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Conference Chair Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania, Policy Chair Jon Kyl of Arizona, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, and Majority Whip Roy Blunt. The only Democrat to score
100 percent with the Christian coalition was Senator Zell Miller of
Georgia, who recently quoted from the biblical book of Amos on the
senate floor: "the days will come, sayeth the Lord God, that i will send
a famine in the land." he seemed to be relishing the thought.
     And why not? There's a constituency for it. A 2002 TIME/CNN poll
found that 59 percent of Americans believe that the prophecies found in
the book of Revelations are going to come true. Nearly one-quarter think
the Bible predicted the 9/11 attacks. Drive across the country with your
radio tuned to the more than 1,600 Christian radio stations or in the
motel turn some of the 250 Christian TV stations and you can hear some
of this end-time gospel. And you will come to understand why people
under the spell of such potent prophecies cannot be expected, as Grist
puts it, "to worry about the environment. Why care about the earth when
the droughts, floods, famine and pestilence brought by ecological
collapse are signs of the apocalypse foretold in the bible? Why care
about global climate change when you and yours will be rescued in the
rapture? And why care about converting from oil to solar when the same
god who performed the miracle of the loaves and fishes can whip up a few
billion barrels of light crude with a word?"

     Because these people believe that until Christ does return, the lord
will provide. One of their texts is a high school history book,
America's providential history. You'll find there these words: "the
secular or socialist has a limited resource mentality and views the
world as a pie...that needs to be cut up so everyone can get a piece.'
however, "[t]he Christian knows that the potential in god is unlimited
and that there is no shortage of resources in god's earth......while
many secularists view the world as overpopulated, Christians know that
god has made the earth sufficiently large with plenty of resources to
accommodate all of the people." No wonder Karl Rove goes around the
White House whistling that militant hymn, "Onward Christian Soldiers."
He turned out millions of the foot soldiers on November 2, including
many who have made the apocalypse a powerful driving force in modern
American politics.
     I can see in the look on your faces just how had it is for the
journalist to report a story like this with any credibility. So let me
put it on a personal level. I myself don't know how to be in this world
without expecting a confident future and getting up every morning to do
what I can to bring it about. So I have always been an optimist. Now,
however, I think of my friend on Wall Street whom I once asked: "What do
you think of the market?" "I'm optimistic," he answered. "Then why do
you look so worried?" And he answered: "Because I am not sure my
optimism is justified."
     I'm not, either. Once upon a time I agreed with the Eric Chivian and
the Center for Health and the Global Environment that people will
protect the natural environment when they realize its importance to
their health and to the health and lives of their children. Now I am not
so sure. It's not that I don't want to believe that - it's just that I
read the news and connect the dots:

     I read that the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has declared the election a mandate for President Bush on the
environment. This for an administration that wants to rewrite the Clean
Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act protecting
rare plant and animal species and their habitats, as well as the
National Environmental Policy Act that requires the government to judge
beforehand if actions might damage natural resources.
     That wants to relax pollution limits for ozone; eliminate vehicle
tailpipe inspections; and ease pollution standards for cars, sports
utility vehicles and diesel-powered big trucks and heavy equipment.
     That wants a new international audit law to allow corporations to
keep certain information about environmental problems secret from the
public.
     That wants to drop all its new-source review suits against polluting
coal-fired power plans and weaken consent decrees reached earlier with
coal companies.
     That wants to open the artic wildlife refuge to drilling and
increase drilling in Padre Island National Seashore, the longest stretch
of undeveloped barrier island in the world and the last great coastal
wild land in America.
     I read the news just this week and learned how the Environmental
Protection Agency had planned to spend nine million dollars - $2 million
of it from the administration's friends at the American Chemistry
Council - to pay poor families to continue to use pesticides in their
homes. These pesticides have been linked to neurological damage in
children, but instead of ordering an end to their use, the government
and the industry were going to offer the families $970 each, as well as
a camcorder and children's clothing, to serve as guinea pigs for the
study.
     I read all this in the news.
     I read the news just last night and learned that the
administration's friends at the international policy network, which is
supported by Exxon Mobile and others of like mind, have issued a new
report that climate change is 'a myth,' sea levels are not rising,
scientists who believe catastrophe is possible are 'an embarrassment.'
     I not only read the news but the fine print of the recent
appropriations bill passed by Congress, with the obscure (and obscene)
riders attached to it: a clause removing all endangered species
protections from pesticides; language prohibiting judicial review for a
forest in Oregon; a waiver of environmental review for grazing permits
on public lands; a rider pressed by developers to weaken protection for
crucial habitats in California.

     I read all this and look up at the pictures on my desk, next to the
computer - pictures of my grandchildren: Henry, age 12; of Thomas, age
10; of Nancy, 7; Jassie, 3; Sara Jane, nine months. I see the future
looking back at me from those photographs and I say, "Father, forgive
us, for we know now what we do." And then I am stopped short by the
thought: "That's not right. We do know what we are doing. We are
stealing their future. Betraying their trust. Despoiling their world."
     And I ask myself: Why? Is it because we don't care? Because we are
greedy? Because we have lost our capacity for outrage, our ability to
sustain indignation at injustice?
     What has happened to out moral imagination?
     On the heath Lear asks Gloucester: "'How do you see the world?" And
Gloucester, who is blind, answers: "I see it feelingly."
     I see it feelingly.
     The news is not good these days. I can tell you, though, that as a
journalist I know the news is never the end of the story. The news can
be the truth that sets us free - not only to feel but to fight for the
future we want. And the will to fight is the antidote to despair, the
cure for cynicism, and the answer to those faces looking back at me from
those photographs on my desk. What we need to match the science of human
health is what the ancient Israelites called 'hocma' - the science of
the heart.....the capacity to see....to feel....and then to act...as if
the future depended on you.
     Believe me, it does.

There are no true Christians.

"There are no christians?"

There are many good people who call themselves Christian.
There are too many bad people who call themselves christians.

"What's the difference between a good Christian
and a bad Christian?"

I don't understand the question.

"Well, I mean, is a good Christian one who=20
has faith in God?  And a bad Christian one
who has does not have any faith at all?"

There are people who call themselves good
Christians and do not have any faith at all,
I suppose.

"You are intransigently biased against
Christians, aren't you, or should I say
people, good or bad, who call themselves
Christians?"

Yes, you should frame the question with=20
your latter clause.  Yes, I am sometimes
biased against people, both good and bad,
who call themselves Christian.  It is not
a good bias, frankly.  All people need
what they need to live their lives and=20
make their lives meaningful, after all.
That includes people who call themselves
christians.

"So maybe you need to be biased
against bad people who call themselves
Christians?"

Don't we all?  No, seriously, my bias
doesn't go deep enough, often.

"What should we do about this Faith
thing?  Can we do anything about it?"

Heaven knows that we can accept=20
the fact that we have it.

"What?  Faith or the Faith thing?"

Both, but you meant the Faith thing.
Well, what do YOU think we should=20
do about it, if we can in fact do anything
about it?  I have faith in your power=20
to answer the question yourself.

"I meant the Faith in God thing,=20
and I asked you first."

What do I look like, a God thing,
for chrissakes!

"No, but..."

Well, then I may disappoint you=20
here.  I think that all we can do=20
is develop more faith in each other
and that that will take care of the
Faith in God thing.

"Then you mean we need to=20
get rid of the Faith in God=20
thing.  Why should that=20
disappoint me?"

No, you cannot get rid=20
of the Faith in God thing.
I said that I believe
we can only develop more faith
in each other.

"Keep the faith, then.  That's
what you're saying."

Probably.

They hang the man and flog the woman

But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

a long time ago, i read a short story (or
perhaps a novel?) by a Russian writer . . .
the only thing that i remember about it at
this point is that it was set in a totalitarian
society, and so strong was the grip of collective
imperative that the people eating in a cafeteria
seemed to be chewing their food with metronomic
regularity . . . (reminds me now of that scene
in a Simpsons episode in which the students,
under the strict control of Principal Skinner,
are marching down the hall in unison & even
blinking in unison . . .)

it's that word, "metronome," that has stuck with
me over the years (being at the time a music
student, it made an impression on me), and
i'd like to go back and read the story again.

i know my memory of the story/novel is sketchy,
but can anyone identify it for me?

Richard,

This is a lot for me to take in. What I can say is that with my Jewish =
heritage I still look at other Jewish "normative, separatist" groups as =
almost un-Jewish. It's like taking something to an extreme annhilates =
its substance. The non-religious Zionists I have lived with and the =
ultra-orthodox Chassidics I have lived with are Jewish people who have =
turned Judaism into a separatist group.

So they stand apart from other Jews. Like Language poets stand apart =
from other poets.

This reminds me of Breton or Freud and how they would ex-communicate =
heretics.

You are either with them or against them.

This is what starts wars.

Someone has to be right.

There is no compromise.

Someone has to win.

Then you have clerics who perpetuate the separatism, like language poet =
critics with blogs.

This is the poison, the partisan, separatist behavior.

It's always like this.

And it's based on the fear of surrendering your self-will to a higher =
power.

The higher power of poetry is Venus of course, the Goddess of Harmony, =
Music. Groups like the Language poets serve a different higher power, =
they serve Saturn, or Kronos, the God who eats his children.

The religious clerics and the language poet blog critics try to =
appropriate the higher power into their self, thus becoming a dogmatic =
leader with a fanatical herd-consciousness group of followers who are =
too afraid to trust in themselves and need to give away their power and =
trust in an authority figure.

It's interesting to me how we are talking about poetry and being Jewish. =
And the parallels between Zionists, Ultraorthodox Jews and Language =
Poets. It's also interesting that the behavior of language poet leaders =
is not unlike the behavior of the leaders of the state of Israel.=20

It's interesting, and it's not surprising at all because this is human =
nature. To be devisive, to carve out a small territory and defend it =
against outsiders, or terrorists.

In the case of Israelies, they are holding onto land that belongs to =
everyone. Americans do not share "our" land with Native Americans who =
are a "sub-class" of human beings. And Israel does not share "their" =
land with the "sub-human" Palestinians.

It reminds me also of the MAG and how (when I was still involved in the =
daily operation of it) groups of poets would be offended when I would =
publish the work of poets from different groups in the same issue. Or =
poets who were indendent and unaffilated.

It's all about people being the same on a basic level, which is a simple =
fact. But how this simple fact is denied out of fear, and thus groups, =
sects, cells, bands - call it what you will - form and battle with each =
other, over who is right and who is wrong.

August

The Book of Brueckl - Part 3



perfectly calculable stutter of
holiness, the limp structure of the shore of wounds, hollow
gloss of gravity: when they feel anxious, unread, the
enduring insertion of lovers' dawns, malignant sky of
antiquity, revealing lead pencils shedding no one can never
be nearly this difference between breaths, raveling speech
stranded inside the bubbled lair: undone: woke up:
startlingly electric blue sky: tattered breath trajectories
hardened particularly startled declensions in derision: Not
even differentiated hyacinths' diminished wounds insinuate
pangs of vaporous consternation in technicolor, achingly
shining, dissolving: styrofoam pillars sunken, scruples of
Jesse, gradual green atrocities sharply melting madrigals:
flames coinciding with an agitated piece of sunlight peeping
into the corrosive hours, brittle pretexts bickering: I,
too, debilitated: intense sheer lines leap: wrinkled
mechanisms attaching themselves to the bubbled lair: undone:
woke up: startlingly electric blue sky: tattered breath of
the beyond: bluntly belied, stirring: imbibe: elbow murmur,
insect twine braided under the scented niche: identical: it
was in spits presence: never: I cannot forget it: actual
description shedding angles, oftener sublime light's
agonized cadence: Bosoms transcend the fraudulent delirium
of holiness, the spacious factory, in derision, as it is: no
difference, creeping, rock chatter: not very nearly being
there: perquisite eucalyptus, magnolia, raffia, ilex, berry,
aigrette, pheasant feathers, shimmery butchery, barbed
mish-mash within the breakable scum: transformed cobwebs
confiscating the reluctance of unmeaning numbers often
wrested from out of tangled flaws' germination drainage,
corpses of affectation, rupture of boredom, feelingly
assimilating alphabets of night transcend the text, the
lonely cadence of textured darkness: outflanked fiery
eyebrows prostrated obliquely, naive motions, umbilical
limbs all around: infringed dialect submerged in the unreal:
outside, the unreal: outside, the impure sounds: undefiled
tenses suppressed, debilitated lips, stunned ghosts' naked
diversions: wretched wheezes, interchangeable gapes, rasping
lovers locating the silvery light's faint splendor:
remembered ember of memory discern your wrist: it is an
empty pyx: nobody divided the rim of praise: trench mouth
wind glory: the audacity of disturbed decisions' hysterical
bulges dripping precisely giddy rivulets drained out of
aloes arising: squandered stag rusted hollow, nuanced,
tilted down, grasping, curling: welded drone receding,
lilacs in adoration, coming from eons ago: dead paradise's
arc doomed: can never insolvent, always wafting aeration:
here, blurred, striated: to see the luggage of the breathing
tissue of bruised sprinkles: exactness inserted, faked: Hear
it, sunbeams out of the audacity of the tedious absence of
breath fiercely glimpsed, displaced not only hollow
rectilinear arrowheads under the diminished bosom, airy
pangs in ditches surging against haughty crawling words'
bosoms' bones, diminishing gradually when rambling brackets
of mirrors, the vehicle of earshot, unanimous sacs
unthought, appositely ecstatic lips never losing their
impotence in this is never, I peed some icky stuff on a
sacred reaction to be there is eaten: scathes: chasms of
pleasure fatigued, the text, the fraudulent delirium of
death speckled and broken: holy vertical and figural: in
pre-delineated flames' transient intimacy: anguish of
unmeaning numbers often limpid, very likely quivering,
disoriented: hourly canticles of tormented moments, assays
enemas' commas obtruding on the retracting sediments on
codicils beforehand: muffled compunction: what about it:
actual description shedding no one can be: jackal of
cerulean wheatfields' fallopian leaves: darker maniacal
crackling, stuttering carapace, sleepy quincunxes, aching
rain, graceful stillness, marigold exposure: they feel
anxious, unread, the footstools of eternity's cells stoking
the wretchedness of evergreens' swollen clutter, inert nouns
dazed: waking pod, mired cortex: I desire an object within,
rarer than raw, that billowed when rambling brackets of
gold-fringed blossoms are undefiled tenses suppressed,
debilitated lips, stunned ghosts' naked diversions: wretched
wheezes, interchangeable gapes, rasping lovers locating the
desert of the square root of breath trajectories hardened
particularly to tutelary irises, speechless as it was to be,
wrath of lovers' dawns, malignant sky of the machinery of
textured darkness: outflanked fiery eyebrows prostrated
obliquely, naive motions, umbilical limbs all in illuminated
goggles, slashed the diminished bosom, spirals' pangs,
listening seeds: dead paradise's arc doomed: can you in
flames coinciding around the root of effectual dustiness,
winded hassles, floating rectitude leaking, collapsing:
useless spores of sounds, the impure identity of holiness,
the breath trajectories hardened particularly to oblivion's
abandoned cords: disinterred chords clanging in strung-out
mists' cawing daisies, excavated from out of bruised
sprinkles: exactness inserted, faked: Hear it, sunbeams out
of stinking whispers puffing, ulcered, coming from the
grinding cavity, the breath woven endlessly, copious
dosages, rectangular apodal afterthoughts blackened:
finally, desperately, ah, wounds glowing, trickling in,
musky: abandoned cords: disinterred chords clanging in the
feebly foaming motion of night transcend the apotheosis of
the savage robin's egg blue sky: tattered flashes: lost
eyelash in the ailanthus: suddenly swerving to and relighted
impatiently, dead ache seen as you can know: underneath,
gazing undone, ecstatic lips never be nearly often wrested
from out of lovers' dawns, malignant sky of differences
desiring sieved wombs, the sentences of eternity's cells
stoking the vehicle of the ultimate inevitable: exactly as
it feels dusk belittles the quarry of malversation: will
they came with an apparent interruption, leaning on the skin
of wincing whitecaps' fetid wakes litigating the invisible
scent of love: felt odor's chilly omission, very nearly this
difference between breaths, raveling speech stranded inside
the length and relighted impatiently, dead wood wholly
saturated on the moment outside light's thicket, perfectly
pulsating and prolonged, a sacred reaction to be
heartbreak's curse in the fraudulent delirium of night
transcend the ailanthus: suddenly swerving to the damp
antennae eluding the breathing propositions shrieking:
swooning lichen bone, inaudible dilemma attributed to
afflictions of holiness, the tedious absence of thorns,
hours out and urinating in spits presence: never: I peed
some icky stuff on the moonlight when they came with the
ultimate inevitable: exactly as it was, impending crux of
Jesse, gradual green atrocities sharply melting madrigals:
flames of wave-pierced illusions: technical squiggles,
open-mouthed wherewithal:

This is interesting - but August how to "place" your poetics on the line -if
there is a line - betwixt say the symbolists, the romantic  surrealists such
as Dylan Thomas, George Barker etal: Roethke (?) (somewhat a
"confessional"), to (let's jump) to the denseness of Koch  of 'The Suns
Tries to Go On'  (it doesnt "flow" as your work here does - and is  perhaps
more deliberately
disjuncted./disjointed).......................................

..................with the verbal and semantic/syntactic acrobatics  (albeit
they are by and large more "deliberate" ... more informed perhaps by certain
liguistics/poetic/philosohic/poetic concepts or domains) and others - you
were saying something about the language poets before - but your work here
(I've looke at it fairly quicky there is some energetic and fascinting
ideation/imagery here) has a "languagy" complexion -no? ?

Clearly of course this is part fo larger work so it neds to be seen in
totum....

Good stuff anycase

Lori,

I just had a reply I sent to George Bowering rejected by the list.
How come? It didn't have any attachments in it, just a hyperlink.

Apropos of this, I would like to call your attention to an organization I am
involved with in Queens, NY. (I am a member of the honorary board.) It's
called Movement One: Creative Coalition. The website-in-progress is at
www.movementone.org. Movement One brings together writers from other
countries living in Queens, many of them quite well-known and well-respected
in their own languages/countries. Several were imprisoned and tortured for
their activities as poets and writers in their own countries and at least
one is recognized as an authority on the ghazal. This past September,
Movement One held the second Queens International Poetry Festival at which
writers from many countries, including Colombia, China, Korea, Iran,
Pakistan and the US read poetry in their own languages--sometimes
accompanied by translations, sometimes not. It seems to me it's an
organization with an idea worth supporting and emulating.

If you're interested in finding out more, or if you live in New York and
would like to get involved, the executive director of the organization is
named Paul Catafago. His email address is paulcatafago@hotmail.com.

Cheers!

The exhibit POETRY and its ARTS: Bay Area interactions 1954-2004 will
open to the public on Saturday December 11, 2004, and will occupy the
galleries at California Historical Society in downtown San Francisco's
museum district for 17 weeks, until April 16, 2005.  More than 100
original works --many never publicly exhibited-- by over 80 individuals
will be on display.  This first-of-its-kind exhibit represents a
collaboration between the Poetry Center at San Francisco State
University, currently observing its 50th anniversary with poetry
programs throughout the city, and the California Historical Society. The
exhibit offers a multi-faceted window onto the rich interactions that
have taken place over the past half-century, centered around San
Francisco's celebrated poetry community.

The exhibit, curated by Poetry Center Director Steve Dickison, is
focused
on:

                ~ art made by poets
                  ~ poet-artist collaborations
                 ~ works by artists in poets' circles

The exhibit will prominently feature San Francisco poet and visual
artist Norma Cole's site-specific installation Collective Memory, a
multimedia work situated in the foyer of the gallery, made in
collaboration with the Poetry Center and sponsored by the Creative Work
Fund.  Cole's activities will involve the composition of a work of
poetry within the space of the gallery, with subsequent publication as a
fine-print artist's edition by Granary Books of New York City.

A broad spectrum of individual artworks, beginning in the 1950s with
original pieces by prominent poet-artists close to the Poetry Center
from its early days, will lead up to a diverse array of contemporary
artworks that carry on the Bay Area's interactive poet-artist
traditions.

Exceptional earlier pieces exhibited in the show include:

*  Kenneth Rexroth's distinctive, delicate work with pastels
*  rarely shown collaborations and individual works by Robert Duncan and
Jess
*  Kenneth Patchen's fantastical painted beasts
*  Allen Ginsberg's West Coast photos from 1955 during the time of  his
poem Howl to 1984
*  Saburo Hasegawa's wildly exuberant calligraphic work based on Lao
Tsu's Tao Te Ching
*  an original private press work by William Everson (Brother
Antoninus), who undertook the printer's trade while in a World War II
Conscientious Objector camp in Waldport, Oregon
*  paintings by poets Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Diane di
Prima
*  Mary Oppen's torn-paper collage depicting her husband, poet George
Oppen
*  calligraphic works by friends and Reed College alumni Lew Welch,
Philip Whalen, and Gary Snyder, students of legendary calligrapher Lloyd
Reynolds
*  surreal balladeer Helen Adam's otherworldly collage-work
*  David Meltzer's collages mining the iconography of Jewish Kabbalah
*  Fran Herndon's collages invoking pop-culture icons Willie Mays and
Marilyn Monroe
*  rare visual works by poets Robin Blaser, Jack Spicer, Madeline
Gleason, and Barbara Guest
*  major early paintings by Black Mountain College alumni Tom Field and
Paul Alexander, regarded as signal works of the time
*  the generation of assemblage artists that coalesced in the Bay Area
during the 1950s will be represented with works by Wallace Berman, Jess,
Bruce Conner, and George Herms

Among new pieces in the exhibit, highlights include recent works by Bay
Area painters Carlos Villa, Amy Trachtenberg, Gustavo Ramos Rivera,
Arnold J Kemp, and Oliver Jackson.  The exhibit will not focus
intensively on books, though several outstanding examples of area
book-arts will appear on display.  Individual photo-portraits and
historical shots by area photographers will accent the painted, drawn,
handprinted, and constructed artworks.

"In many ways, this exhibit is a tribute to the poet-artist galleries
that had short but significant lifespans in San Francisco of the 1950s
and '60s: King Ubu Gallery, the Six Gallery, Batman Gallery, Borregard's
Museum, Buzz Gallery, and the North Beach coffeehouses and bars that did
double duty as art-spaces. The San Francisco of this period served as a
geographic confluence of radically realized individual and collective
visions.  Poets and artists together as friends, lovers, rivals, and
audience to one another's practice, creatively imagined a city perched
on the country's far coast, and worked together to bring that city into
being."
                    --Steve Dickison, curator of the exhibit

POETRY and its ARTS: Bay Area interactions 1954-2004 is dedicated to
extraordinary San Francisco artist Jess (1923-2004), companion of the
late poet Robert Duncan, pioneer of California assemblage art, and great
friend to the poets, and to San Francisco literary editor Donald M.
Allen (1912-2004), whose 1960 anthology The New American Poetry
1945-1960, and subsequent work as editor and publisher, was instrumental
in opening up audiences for an innovative counter-tradition of American
poets, many of whom have works on display in the exhibit.

The exhibit will also feature several additional public programs,
details to be announced, to take place within the gallery space and at
other San Francisco locations. In conjunction with the exhibit, three
special evenings of poetry-related film and video are scheduled to take
place November 18, December 2, and December 12, under the series heading
Moving Picture Poetics.  The series is curated by San Francisco cinema
artist Konrad Steiner, and is a collaboration between the Poetry Center
and San Francisco Cinematheque.  For program details, show times, and
locations, contact San Francisco Cinematheque,
http://www.sfcinematheque.org, 415-552-1990, or the Poetry Center's
website: http://www.sfsu.edu/~poetry. Gallery admission for POETRY and
its ARTS is $3 for adults.  Students with ID, $1.00. High school
students, with identification, can be admitted free of charge, and
docent tours designed for high-school age audiences can be arranged by
contacting the Poetry Center, 415-338-2227, e-mail: poetry@sfsu.edu.
Galleries at California Historical Society, 678 Mission Street (4 doors
east of 3d St.) are open to the public Wednesday thru Saturday, noon to
4:30 pm.

No Politics


He was listening to someone playing the blues on a guitar when the suicide
bomber entered the cafe.

Everything went dark and silent.

Next he found himself in a hospital, neck in a brace, arm in a cast, skin
scorched, limbs lacerated, eardrums blown out, brain contusion, partly
paralyzed on his left side.

But he had one more wound.

He had bumps all over his body.  The doctors called the bumps "organic
shrapnel."  They explained that the force of the blast had hurled pieces of
the bomber's body into his own.  They said the "organic shrapnel" could not
be removed.

He had survived, and he would heal -- but now he would live with the enemy
he did not wish to have embedded in him.

When we organized the first Queens International
Poetry Festival in September, 2003, we had no idea
that it would lead to formally organizing our group of
renegades into a registered non-profit. As this became
reality, and we did more work as Movement One:
Creative Coalition, we realized the importance of
creating a website that would reflect our vision.
It is with great satisfaction, then, that I am proud
to announce that our website:
http://www.movementone.org is up and running. Because
the nature of our work is dealing with extremely
talented artists from different cultures, we see
movementone.org as a universal meeting place and we
urge you and other writers/artists that you know to
submit work.
Please check out the website and I am looking forward
to hearing from you.

for some time, is a member of our advisory board.

Richard,

I did read thomas and roethke and admired both. my english teacher in my =
senior year in high school was a mentor for many years and he gave me =
their books as house-warming gifts when i moved away to college

i don't know how to place myself. except that i am using technological =
tools that i apply to texts that are first manually written. sometimes =
it works and sometimes it doesn't.

i know i am influenced by music and film more by poets

i think of myself as a classicist

the classics was my major at UC Berkeley.

i still read and re-read virgil and dante.

i was then influenced by tibetan buddhism and chassidism which for me =
was about expansiveness and limitlessness, experiencing the space =
between thoughts

oh and i was in jungian therapy for 10 years with an analyst who studied =
in switzerland with the students of Jung.

so archetypal psychology (richard hillman) has had a strong influence on =
me

i think archetypal-techno-devotional poet would define me since i am so =
religious, not normatively but spiritually

i can't come up with a better definition right now

jazz has never been an influence nor beat or language poets

i liked burroughs and acker

i like their structure more

I think of this in terms fo the unconscious. Kerouac , the deeper he goes into his alcoholism and the paranoid reactionary investments of his unconscious , becomes less and less, and is rigid with flickers and flashes of the old self. Or self number one. The beat and his line. The further Keroauc goes into becoming a non-becoming, the more he is personally dogmatic, frightened, depressed, withdrawn as the jargon has it. He becomes the hated other self of his fears. However his writing does not become less, but more or takes on the characteristic of the supple and fourth line of the four lines of flight GuattariDeleuze discuss in One THosuand Plateaus.
Interestingly Ginsberg becomes less racist more open less pro Israel and more pro world. At least in his work,  but and this is not a new point, many find this honesty disarming, this strippingbare of the self, embarrassing, and even maudlin. And there is much of that in his work and there always was.

But as a writer it is Kerouac who really opens the lines of change and movement and flight. GInsberg becomes less a poetry machine and more a figure filled with his ego-deflation, living in a schizophrenic contradiction. bEComing antisemitic is a form of paranoia for Kerouac who on other does not become less of a writer, and even a great writer. Ginsberg's flight which began way back in Xalba days of his poesy, turns outto be the old man in grey the Wordsworth or less of his own milieu and time: I dont say this to slight either poet, but actuallly find the whole thing hilarious. And were one to be honest, Id say the music of Wordsworth has sown more seeds, than Howl. and Kaddish. (but what seeds of quatum does it matter -- both are proper names of intense energy and intensity of flight and fire) .
But no one quotes Ginsberg better that Guattari and Deleuze in AntiOedipus. They isolate those astounding lines (From KaddiSh O Mother etc...), yet to be surpassed, and High Light the Beauty of theiR ParaNoia - the Line's paranoia. Because all great Poetry is Paranoid And Non Paranoid. But metanoiD is perhapS a better SolUtion to what is and Must be a way of Life. Big shot poets know this as they make a living spouting forth their Dreams. Because after all what are poets selling but an ideology called the Imaginary. I love all this and Kerouac great singer, and greater singer of generation than Allen his pal and wanna be lover 'for' gave gave him before what ever he needed in forgiving of his socalled sins, and slanders , racisms. AN the CathOlic Mystical BudDHiSm of Jack will always stand hiM in good Stea
 Jack KeroUAc's delire and line of fight and flight is the tangled skein (Pound Pound!) of his generation. No wonder they slewed the centuries with their love.

Subject:      book reviews of books I like (for the most part)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Recent books, emphasis on computers, philosophy


I am still reviewing books that O'Reilly sends me. The arrangement is
ideal; I'm under no obligation to like the books - on the other hand, I
don't ask to review books that are outside my field of interest, and
what I do find is often of interest. Many of the ones that have come in
recently will be of value to new media artists interested in expanding
either their internal computer environment, or the external potential
for controlled installations made somewhat on the fly.

Here are the recent entrants, in no particular order; the computer books
come first, since I'm feeling utilitarian at the moment. (Sudden fear: Is
that the right word?)

PC Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Jim Aspinwall, O'Reilly.
Okay, this one really _is_ industrial, and I'd recommend making the hacks
first on an older machine. That said, this digs deeper into the bios,
memory, etc. than other books I've seen. I want to eventually create a
pseudo-lan machine for installations and presentations - and this book
would be of considerable value, since I can start and modify from the
ground up, not losing too much in the process. There's terrific
information on heat sinks, cpu speedups, video, etc.

By the way, why do any of this? Because one can tailor a machine to his or
her specs - which can be critical, for example, for laptop performance,
heavy video processing, muxing, what have you. For this reason, I also
want to recommend the ExtremeTech series of books from Wiley - the one I'm
using - which, again, is highly detailed, is

Hacking Windows XP, Steve Cinshak, Wiley. Like the first book, this is
$24.99 - it was marked down 40% at Barnes and Noble. The book deals a lot
with bootup speeds and configurations, speeding up the boot screen, making
the computer more responsive, increasing speed, etc. Some of the info is
found in a number of other books; here, it's extremely detailed, and I've
had no problem applying things to my WinXP multimedia machine.

Spam Kings, O'Reilly, Brian McWilliams. I said that I probably could not
review this, since it doesn't cover things like the 'nigerian' spams. They
sent it anyway. I must say the book is astounding in the weirdness it
uncovers, and in the apparent messiness of spam history. At times spam
fighters change sides, or work both against - what? It's like a paean to
postmodernity. Individual histories, identities, spam offers, ISPs, etc.,
are changed at the drop of a hat; there are prosecutions, but they're
somewhat ineffective. The book shows, guess what, that Bush's spam law is
basically useless. I'd try to find this on Amazon. It's hardbound $22.95,
and is one of the books I'll pass on - a terrific read, but no reason to
return to it.

Smart home Hacks, Tips & Tools for Automating Your House, Gordon Meyer,
O'Reilly. Well, this is fantastic for someone with a smart home; ours is
particularly dumb, without a tv remote, and many kludged computer
thingies. But I will end up using this book constantly - since the hacks,
which cover things that go on with movement change, light change,
temperature change, logic change, etc. etc., are cheap, and applicable to
art installations of all sorts. If you have a real hardware techie to work
with, you probably won't need this - but I do. Next year, I hope to hook
some of these things up with motion capture, and then... Anyway, this book
is already proving indispensable - if you do any sort of digital media
work and you want potentially cheap fixes, take a look.

Degunking Your Email, Spam, and Viruses, Jeff Duntemann, Paraglyph. This,
and similar books, are invaluable if you use Outlook or Eudora or any mail
program that involves downloading; I haven't needed it, since I use unix
(which on a practical level, is incredibly configurable, eliminates a
whole lot of spam/virus problems, etc.). But I wanted to see this, since I
help people with computers on a fairly regular basis, and this is to be
recommended for a mid-level user who wants to streamline and clean up his
or her Net connections. It talks about 'strategy' which I like a lot - not
assuming that all email users are the same, and emphasizing knowledge
management from the Inbox on. I might add that a small business owner
would use this to advantage. On the other hand, if you don't use a
download program, and/or don't have much spam (this is useful for people
using Yahoo etc. who are filtering), then this isn't really necessary.
Good chapters by the way on viruses, worms, trojans, and other critters.

Game Console Hacking, Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, Atari, & Gamepark 32,
Joe Grand (with Frank Thornton, Albert Yarusso), Syngress. The back says
"Have Fun While Voiding Your Warranty." I wanted to see this, partly out
of curiosity (it was offered to me via O'Reilly), and partly out of a real
desire to take a console apart (again, a project put off for a few
months). You can find some of this stuff at the Salvation Army, not to
mention E-Bay, and the very idea of making an Atari 2600PC is really
appealing. You've already get head-starts with some of the components,
including case, possibly the power-supply, switches, etc. If you have a
kid into gaming and soldering, this is a book for him or her. There's good
stuff, by the way, for digital artists on homebrew game development with
various platforms.

Building the Perfect PC, Thompson & Thompson, O'Reilly. Yes, a section on
a 'kick-ass LAN party PC,' among others. The guide has color illustrations
which are the clearest I've ever seen. I haven't yet built a PC from the
ground up, but have obviously changed components 'and stuff.' But this
will allow me to decide, first, on one sort of machine I want, and second,
how to go about a strategy of construction. The machines range from high-
performance servers through multi-media machines.

A lot of these books reflect, for me, a lack of community; almost all my
cultural connections are now online, and in the 'real world,' I'm not
connected with any institution. There's no tech person in my environment,
no one gaming, no hackers, etc. So the books serve a very useful function
- guides to a kind of communal knowledge otherwise unavailable. This goes
for the pc and console mod books, even the smart home hacking one.

Windows XP Power Hound, Preston Gralla, Pogue/O'Reilly. This book is
slightly 'below' Hacking Windows XP (the Wiley one) and PC Hacks. If you
purchase any of these, you should decide on what you're doing. I knew the
material in the Power Hound work, and had already applied most of the
stuff (for example TweakUI) to my machine. On the other hand, if you are
just using WinXP, this is definitely the work for you. What you spend on
this stuff will honestly come back to you in increased productivity. I
know this sounds idiotic, but it's amazing how highly responsive machines
will lower your stress level - or direct it in more productive directions.
This book as well as Hacking Windows XP, by the way, emphasize benchmarks
and their use.

What I'm basically saying, for better or worse - and this goes for Mac
users as well - most people, even most digital artists I know, take their
machines and form factors for granted. What's there is there, just throw
some more RAM in, and that's all. When I work them them, I often find
'messes' all over the place - and slow machines which freeze fairly often.
If you're using PCs with WinXP I highly recommend - I can't say this too
often - that you get one or more of these or similar books...

Representing the Republic: Mapping the United States, 1600-1900, John
Rennie Short, Reaktion, 2001. I have one of Jedidiah Morse's early
American geographies, from 1796 (third edition). Morse was critical in the
construct of American (read USA) identity, early on; this is the nation
looking at itself after a couple of decades. The implications of Short's
book go beyond the work, to the configuration of ideology itself at the
heart of Empire. Morse is, of course only one of the geographers covered,
but the one of most interest to me. The book is illustrated with numerous
maps and other images.

Performance Art, From Futurism to the Present, RoseLee Goldberg, revised
and enlarged edition, Abrams, 1988. I love this book because of its
grittiness. I saw an incredible amount of performance in the 70s, and
participated in some myself. This book covers that era in general, when
'performance' as a genre didn't exist, and both audience and performer
(who might for that matter be one and the same) negotiated space and time,
role and behavior, etc.; nothing could be taken for granted. Performance
wasn't even a genre in the making; there had been aktions, actions,
happenings, theatrical 'events,' etc., but nothing particularly fixed.
What interests me in this material (besides reminiscence) is the centrality
of the _body_ to the works - a centrality which gets quickly consumed by
current technohgizmo. Too many works today occur as if concept/ual art and
performance hadn't existed - it's as if the wheel has to be continually
reinvented whenever a new mode of distribution comes along. This book only
begins to cover the ground, by the way - speaking of which, I also picked
up

The Writings of Robert Smithson, edited by Nancy Holt, NYU, 1979 - which,
at this point, everyone interested in new media, digital art, etc. should
read - not because he precurses, but because he doesn't. There's a
recapitulation of the earth, dirt, the symbolic within material
substrates, that's critical - particularly now, when so much of the
planet's ecosystems are disappearing. This is another way to go, and to go
edgy, and it would be fascinating to see this approach combined with
digital work - without, for once, endless discussions of 'mapping.'
- I can't believe how well he _writes._ And from this it's an easy go to

Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching, Second Edition, edited by
Dave Foreman and Bill Haywood, Forward! by Edward Abbey, 1990. I was in
Tasmania years ago, and there was an active ecology movement which went
beyond protest to destruction. I firmly believe in this - what the main-
stream media calls 'ecoterrorism,' but which seems really the only way to
stop development. At this point 4 species disappear from the planet - 4
SPECIES - PER HOUR; almost all of the larger mammals face extinction in
the wild (if not altogether), etc. I don't see any point in facing
developers, poachers, etc., peacefully - and this book gives a point by
point guide to acts of destruction against machinery, home construction,
and so forth. I might add, while I applaud these acts, I'm by and large a
coward; I'm afraid of the police, of jail, torture, beatings. All I can do
is recommend this - like a lot of the other older books, you could find it
on www.abe.com, or amazon, etc.

I love the projects of Carnap, Quine, etc., and for this reason, love

Future Pasts, The Analytic Tradition in Twentieth-Century Philosophy,
edited by Juliet Floyd and Sanford Shieh, Oxford, 2001. This book as a
prescient series of essays by people like Hintikka (on Ernst Mach), Quine,
Putnam (on Reichenbach), etc., with an afterword by John Rawls. It's
wonderful, lively. It covers people like Kripke, Turing, Dewey, Carnap,
Heidegger (of Being and Time), Husserl, Wittgenstein (Tractatus), etc. I
love this stuff - the hinge of 19-20-21-century philosophy of math and
science, both of which are emphasized. It's a good read - I'm particularly
interested in Carnap's notion of tolerance in relation to mathematical
foundations/philosophy.

Mi Fu, Style and the Art of Calligraphy in North Song China, Peter Charles
Sturman, Yale, 1997. I love the complexity and intertwined philosophical/
aesthetic strands of traditional calligraphy; Mi Fu was a bit wild and
brilliant, coming after the Tang crystallization. There are copious
reproductions in the book, and an explanation in the introduction of the
principles of calligraphy; you can't get too lost here. I recommend this
to anyone interested in 'why calligraphy' in the first place; it's also
excellent on issues (such as style and naturalness) in aesthetics.

Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, any one of a number of editions. Weirdly
makes a LOT of sense, if only humans could live this way. A greater fun to
read than I would have thought possible. But I do prefer Epictetus, whose
Enchiridion is a masterpiece of terseness. I have different translations
but I've been reading Epictetus, Moral Discourses / Enchiridion and
Fragments, translated by Elizabeth Carter, Everyman, 1910 (1957 reprint).
I'm sure there are much more accurate versions today, but this book feels
right, as does the philosophy. 'In our power are opinion, pursuit, desire,
aversion, and in one word, whatever are our on actions. Not in our power
are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are
not our own actions.' The placement of _body_ is critical. It's easy to
deconstruct this material; it's much more fascinating to read it at
length, absorb it and its world-view - I never thought stoicism, if such it
is, could be so enlightening.

I wanted to read a volume of, or drawing on, the Fundamentalism Project,
and can recommend, highly

Strong Religion, The Rise of Fundamentalisms around the World, Gabriel
Almond, R. Scott Appleby, and Emmanuel Sivan. I'm just reading this now,
and hence can't review it at length, but it makes incredible theological
and socio-cultural sense out of the various fundamentalist movements which
are increasingly occupying 'our' attention. The book works through various
schemata among other things - the chapter titles - The Enclave Culture;
Fundamentalism: Genus and Species; Explaining Fundamentalisms: Structure,
Chance, and Choice; Wrestling with the World: Fundamentalist Movements as
Emergent Systems; Testing the Model: Politics, Ethnicity, and
Fundamentalist Strategies; and The Prospects of Fundamentalism - give a
sense of the whole. I believe books such as this one are critical in our
re/thinking contemporary culture and the future of the planet (whatever
happened to 'God is dead'?). The only thing missing for me is a biological
explanation of fixity or the fetishization of a particular structure -
what Ruskin and Stendhal in different contexts called 'crystallization.'
But this is _my_ bias - the belief that any structure which can short-
circuit self-critique, skepticism, thought itself, actually enhances
species survival; it's biologically harder to live without God than with
It. Most of the work I've seen doesn't go this direction, however (Gordon
Allport touches on it in The Nature of Prejudice, and there have been some
recent studies which escape me..) -

More later; this is already far too long... (not really, however!) -

- Alan

LITERATURE NATION
MARIA DAMON AND MIEKAL AND: THE VISUAL, THE VIRTUAL AND THE GRAMMARS OF=20=

TIME

A Review by Tom HIBBARD

Two similar perfect bound paperbacks Literature Nation by Miekal And=20
and Maria Damon and The Pleasure of the Text by Roland Barthes. The=20
title Literature Nation is unclear. It could imply a nation=20
strengthened in enlightenment. Or it could imply a nation weakened in=20
inbred sensibility. 'Nation' might be misleading, referring=20
symbolically to 'locus of activity' rather than America uptight and at=20=

war in Iraq.

Literature Nation contains poetry. Pleasure of the Text contains=20
critical writing. I think it is interesting that the books are not=20
close in publishing datesthe former being published by Potes and Poets=20=

Press in 2003, the latter being published originally in Paris in 1973=20
and yet are close conceptually. My initial reaction to Literature=20
Nation was that, in a Big Bang cosmos, nature is =91experimental=91 and =
the=20
inexplicable is requisite. Why shouldn't books in different times be=20
close in theme?

The poetry of one book is similar to the critical writing of the other.=20=

Or vice versa. The poetry of Literature Nation isn't stanzaic or free=20
verse. It is eighty-five pages of prose-like paragraphs, written as=20
email exchanges between And and Damon, each paragraph or strophe headed=20=

by a phrase in brackets. Each bracketed heading is a bracketed phrase=20

perhaps like knitting or a chain-making mechanism. The book is divided=20=

thanks to Steve D. for identifying the Russian novel
i was thinking of:

_We_ by Evgenii Ivanovich Zamiatin (1884-1937)

i had remembered the metronomic chewing of the
characters as metaphoric, but apparently in Zamiatin's
futuristic world of the US there was really a kind
of metronome regulating such basic bodily
functions . . . a review that i read speculates that Zamiatin was
satirizing time and motion studies in
the workplace

fascinating . . . i must revisit this book

camille


> a long time ago, i read a short story (or
perhaps a novel?) by a Russian writer . . .
the only thing that i remember about it at
this point is that it was set in a totalitarian
society, and so strong was the grip of collective
imperative that the people eating in a cafeteria
seemed to be chewing their food with metronomic
regularity . . . (reminds me now of that scene
in a Simpsons episode in which the students,
under the strict control of Principal Skinner,
are marching down the hall in unison & even
blinking in unison . . .)

it's that word, "metronome," that has stuck with
me over the years (being at the time a music
student, it made an impression on me), and
i'd like to go back and read the story again.

i know my memory of the story/novel is sketchy,
but can anyone identify it for me?

Dear Friends of Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com

I am writing this letter for two reasons- We will be in Brazil from January
14th until the 29th and if you have any readings or events for January,
February or March for Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison or other areas in our cold
Midwest please send them to me.  I have updated from website for all the
series' featured on the site but please send me anywhere you are reading and
anyone reading at other venues within a 5 hour drive of Chicago for these
months.

new Chicagoland Reading Series:

Chicagopostmodernpoetry Live @ the Oak Park Public Library

As many of you know I had been negotiating with Unity Temple, Frank Lloyd
Wright's masterpiece church to do a reading series at this great venue.
Unfortunately, Unity Temple will be renovated over the next two years and
because of insurance concerns we cannot do the series there.

Fortunately the Debby Prieser and the Oak Park Public Library which sits
across the street from Unity Temple on Lake Street two blocks from the Green
Line elevated Station in Oak Park generously offered their space for our
series and I am eternally in their debt.

The result is that we can develop a good reading series for the West and
Southwest Sides of Chicago, and the Western and Southwestern Suburbs.  The
series in scheduled for 2:00 PM on Saturdays so that we can draw a diverse
audience and it will be on Saturdays that do not conflict with the Chicago
Poetry Project Series at the Harold Washington Library.

We are going to market the series to an audience in our area including
Universities, Schools, and the large Ethnic communities near to Oak Park
including the Polish, Italian, Mexican, and African American communities
that make our area so diverse and interesting. Those of you who consented to
be part of the Advisory Board  we would like very much to have your help
with the series at its new venue. I am in the process of programming this
series anyone who is interesting in helping select readers, themes, or will
be in the Chicago area during the dates below please email me so we can
discuss.

I am looking forward to an exciting 2005 and seeing many of you in our
region

Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Chanukah, Blessed Kwanzaa, Happy
Chinese New Year-

Oh and Happy Football on New Years Day (Go Hawks)

Best one-liner evaluation of the NYTBR I have yet read comes from Ron
Silliman's blog:

"The reason The New York Times has never had a comics section is that
it already has its book review."

Worth checking out his analysis of the provenance -- by publishers --
of all the "best books of the year" in poetry. Not that we didn't know
this, but still, it always comes as a nasty little surprise that
nothing, nopthing ever changes at the NYTBR. I remember the editor of
said/sad magazine (whose name I have forgotten by now) in late 1987 at
an Iowa International Writters forum tell some 50 foreign writers
literally that if it wasn't reviewed in the NYTBR it simply wasn't
worth reading.

Though I do detect an odd little tinge of ethnophobia when Ron wonders
("for what it's worth") that only two of the seven most often cited
"most notable" authors were born or live in the US. The American Tree
just isn't the only one in the field of English-language poetry, bad
fruit (as the case may be in the NYTBR) or not.

Close-up
Mac Low challenged poetic convention by performing his work

By Mark Swed
Los Angeles Times



Jackson Mac Low, 82, a prolific poet who questioned the nature of poetry
and become a pioneer in liberating language from logic and lifting it
into the realm of sound and performance, died Wednesday at Cabrini
Hospital in New York City. He had suffered a stroke last month.

A typical first response to encountering Mac Low in print or at the
podium was one of mystification. Words and nonsense syllables
unconnected by syntax might splay across the page every which way. He
could write sentences that ran on for pages. Modest, shy, seemingly
uncertain, he performed his poems as if they were inexplicable music,
the weird intoning and droning of utterances coming from somewhere deep
and strange inside him.

Inspired by composer John Cage, with whom he studied in the 1950s, Mac
Low used chance operations in making his art. Influenced also by
Buddhist practice, he attempted to free his ego from his words, to take
away his intentions from his art. Yet in defying the expected nature of
poetry, Mac Low could be a peculiarly mesmerizing figure.

"He really went his own way," Marjorie Perloff, an author of several
books on progressive poetics, said Thursday. "But he was one of the few
people who could combine music and word, and he was a true forerunner in
the areas of conceptual art, sound poetry and performance art."

From the very start, Mac Low challenged convention. Born in Chicago in
1922, he was educated at the University of Chicago and Brooklyn College.
His first interest was music, but by 1938, he was already writing poems
with lines such as "Gay cake gotta gay cake go gotta gay cake," and
later he sometimes described himself as a "composer of poetry."

Besides poetry and music, Mac Low was actively interested in theater and
had a close association with the experimental Living Theatre in New York
City during the 1950s and '60s. And in doing so, he didn't so much break
genres as ignore them altogether. Hence, he could provide music for a
Living Theatre staging of W.H. Auden's poem "The Age of Anxiety" or
write his own play, "The Marrying Maiden," meant as text for Cage's
music.

His interest in theater, performance, music and Cage - as well as his
involvement with anarchist thought - also made him a key figure in
Fluxus, the neo-Dada art movement of the early '60s. It was then that
Mac Low came into his own as a performer of his works.

Although he published 27 books, it is as a performer that Mac Low may
best be remembered. However abstract the processes he tirelessly
invented to produce his work, however artificial the poetry might look
as printed text, it always came to life when he read.

A tireless advocate of sound poetry, Mac Low held teaching posts at
Mannes School of Music (1966) and New York University (1966-73) and
lectured widely. Among his many honors was the $100,000 Wallace Stevens
Award from the Academy of American Poets in 1999.

Mac Low is survived by his second wife, the poet Anne Tardos; and two
children, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low and Clarinda Mac Low, from a previous
marriage to painter Iris Lezak.

from the introduction:

"I began making rubBEings in Spring 1999. Walking a great deal, finding=20=

work room=97surrounded by letterings, words, signs=97that I could copy =

lumber crayon and cheap note pad and the rubBEings became not only part=20=

of daily life but of my dreams and memories as well.

RubBEings may well be the oldest form of copy art. Rearranging found=20
signs and letterings, one arrives at visual poems that emerge from the=20=

Stalin would have been the guy to ask, but we weren't on speaking terms.

Communist language goes like this. Tibet is officially called the Tibetan
Autonomous Region, and indeed it does have its own government which is run
of and for the Tibetan region in ways that Sichuan's provincial government
is not of or for the Sichuanese. But of course that doesn't change the
supremacy of the Communist Party, which is where the real autonomy lies.
Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, Yunnan Autonomous Region, and the
Xinjiang Autonomous Region are all like this.

I'm sure that a Jewish Autonomous Region would have been structured pretty
similarly: autonomous or Soviet depending on how it suits the Soviets.

Sorry to Disappoint, but I'm Still an Atheist!
Prof. Antony Flew

Richard C. Carrier, current Editor in Chief of the Secular Web, tells
me that "the internet has now become awash with rumors" that I "have
converted to Christianity, or am at least no longer an atheist."
Perhaps because I was born too soon to be involved in the internet
world I had heard nothing of this rumour. So Mr. Carrier asks me to
explain myself in cyberspace. This, with the help of the Internet
Infidels, I now attempt.

Those rumours speak false. I remain still what I have been now for
over fifty years, a negative atheist. By this I mean that I construe
the initial letter in the word 'atheist' in the way in which everyone
construes the same initial letter in such words as 'atypical' and
'amoral'. For I still believe that it is impossible either to verify
or to falsify - to show to be false - what David Hume in his
Dialogues concerning Natural Religion happily described as "the
religious hypothesis." The more I contemplate the eschatological
teachings of Christianity and Islam the more I wish I could
demonstrate their falsity.

I first argued the impossibility in 'Theology and Falsification', a
short paper originally published in 1950 and since reprinted over
forty times in different places, including translations into German,
Italian, Spanish, Danish, Welsh, Finnish and Slovak. The most recent
reprint was as part of 'A Golden Jubilee Celebration' in the
October/November 2001 issue of the semi-popular British journal
Philosophy Now, which the editors of that periodical have graciously
allowed the Internet Infidels to publish online: see "Theology &
Falsification."

I can suggest only one possible source of the rumours. Several weeks
ago I submitted to the Editor of Philo (The Journal of the Society of
Humanist Philosophers) a short paper making two points which might
well disturb atheists of the more positive kind. The point more
relevant here was that it can be entirely rational for believers and
negative atheists to respond in quite different ways to the same
scientific developments.

We negative atheists are bound to see the Big Bang cosmology as
requiring a physical explanation; and that one which, in the nature
of the case, may nevertheless be forever inaccessible to human
beings. But believers may, equally reasonably, welcome the Big Bang
cosmology as tending to confirm their prior belief that "in the
beginning" the Universe was created by God.

Again, negative atheists meeting the argument that the fundamental
constants of physics would seem to have been 'fine tuned' to make the
emergence of mankind possible will first object to the application of
either the frequency or the propensity theory of probability
'outside' the Universe, and then go on to ask why omnipotence should
have been satisfied to produce a Universe in which the origin and
rise of the human race was merely possible rather than absolutely
inevitable. But believers are equally bound and, on their opposite
assumptions, equally justified in seeing the Fine Tuning Argument as
providing impressive confirmation of a fundamental belief shared by
all the three great systems of revealed theistic religion - Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam. For all three are agreed that we human
beings are members of a special kind of creatures, made in the image
of God and for a purpose intended by God.

In short, I recognize that developments in physics coming on the last
twenty or thirty years can reasonably be seen as in some degree
confirmatory of a previously faith-based belief in god, even though
they still provide no sufficient reason for unbelievers to change
their minds. They certainly have not persuaded me.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Dear Bradley,


An online dictionary informs me that "palliative care"
is the
"relieving or soothing of the symptoms of a disease or
disorder
without effecting a cure." As always, there are the
pestiferous and
ubiquitous on-line ads on this webpage that infect
most of the web.
However, because the Future is Now, these on-line ads
use some voyeur
program to proffer me ads appropriate to the subject
matter I'm
viewing. Thus, the word "cure" has been read by these
Orwellian
programs and there are sundry ads for all sorts of
remedial care:
"Flex-Power Pain Cream" seems the most enticing as it
has a "money
back guarantee"! But wait! ……. These ads are all
resultant from the
definition of "palliative"…… they cannot be actual
cures or healing
agents! Ha! That's rich! I need some clever
academician to explicate
all the latent hilarity in this scenario by
demonstrating its
nefarious semiotic subtext!

Yours in pain,

Jeff.

"Where are you going my blue-eyed son?
Where are you going my darling  young one?
Oh mother ! Here to my bed,
For I fear I am poisoned and  soon must lie down."

It is always to stop what can be known, not to end anything already known,
that moves nations to war; and this as an idea is neither cognitively, nor
rationally held, or for that matter remembered, because it is only dimly
intuited and deeply subliminal, and only expressed outwardly emotionally as  anything
other than what it is. It is embedded in language itself. It is the  stop,
the bumper, the boundary, the edge of the possible world, implanted there  to
hold the human experience together exactly as it is, but now it is becoming
archaic rather than arcane.

One cannot stop the charging bull, and absorbing the punishment of the  horns
for the greater good has proven historically ineffective. One can only
present the target, and clearly eye the bull, and step aside at the very last
instant.

Your Black Eye
An e-Journal for Critical Consciousness

You started to see things more clearly
the moment you were struck...

A Call for Articles, Fiction, Film, and Poetry for the
First Issue

The YBE editors have been punched in the face by their
own preconceptions about politics, economics, and
culture, and encourage contributions from anyone,
regardless of background, reflecting moments of
striking critical clarity and black eye encounters
with the sublime.

We are eager to consider all forms of expression and
inquiry that explore such encounters, most especially
those manifesting a critical awareness of and
engagement in the world at large.  You might, for
example share your black-eye-perspective on Iraq, the
2004 U.S. Election, deficit spending, gender,
sexuality, race, religion, education, immigration, and
labor issues, among others.  Similarly, we welcome
critical examinations of popular culture, contemporary
values, and current affairs.

Submissions can be in any format, including, but not
limited to:

•       Text: 5000 words or less, any genre, including:
essays, fiction, poetry, hybrid forms, and reviews
(music, movies, and events) in a MS Word format.
•       Photos, Paintings, Sculpture, Drawings: (jpg, bmp,
gif).
•       Videos: 10 minutes or less in Real Player or Windows
Media Player formats.
•       Music: 10 minutes or less (mp3, wmv).
•       Hypertext submissions may be feasible: please
inquire.

In a time of narrowing perspectives and experiences,
we wish to broaden discussion and share what some have
referred to as critical consciousness.  YBE
appreciates works that act as servers to help spread
awareness, that contain multiple points of entry and
departure.

All submissions must be original work, not previously
published.

Deadline for submissions for the first volume: January
28, 2005.
Advance submissions encouraged.

Submissions and Inquiries: ybe@yourblackeye.org

Saddened to learn of his passing. I recall arranging for him to read in
Monterey (and assisting him in performance) in 1975. I had read his work
for years, but we'd never met before. He was charming and we spent hours
chatting away.

Michael Rothenberg has asked me to inform you that an electrical fire has
destroyed half of his house in California.

His son and family escaped injury, but the fire destroyed most of his
manuscripts and other archival material. I'm sure many of us, as writers,
can sympathize with his loss.

Michael will publish the next issue of Big Bridge, but it will probably be
delayed. When the situation stabilizes, he will also resume work on Blue
Poets in Red States. Because of the unexpected nature of the situation, he
doesn't have his computer with him. He can receive e-mail, but can't reply.


If anybody has any questions, please backchannel and I'll answer them as
best I can.

Sincerely,

Vernon

NEW from Litmus Press:

Another Kind of Tenderness, by Xue Di

Translated by Keith Waldrop, Forrest Gander, Stephen Thomas, Theodore Deppe
and Sue Ellen Thompson with Hu Qian, Wang Ping, Hil Anderson, Waverly and
Iona Crook.

Peter Gizzi comments:

Xue Di=B9s poetry is at once fierce and tender.  The poems in this collection
are charged with ambient details, each one so chosen out of desire and the
impossible need to articulate the beloved throughout the perceptual world.
The translations are stunning.  This is gorgeous work.

from Theodore Deppe's introduction:

Another Kind of Tenderness is one of poetry=B9s miracles.  How else explain
it?  In the natural order of things, a boy who is beaten daily does not
become a poet this gentle and wise; a six-year old abandoned by both parent=
s
in Beijing (a city then of about 8 million people) does not become a man wh=
o
can write such a luminous book of love poems.

=8AAnother Kind of Tenderness opens with a splendid sequence of lyric poems.
=B3Cat=B9s Eye in a Splintered Mirror=B2 is unmistakably contemporary yet it also
feels rooted in the tradition of Li Po and Tu Fu.  Like the poems of the
Tang dynasty, the poet is presented as an exile, a wanderer, moving through
=B3unfolding layers of landscape,=B2 recalling the one he loves=8A

[IPSM] NFB film: NEIL STONECHILD INQUIRY
Indigenous Peoples Solidarity Movment - Montreal ipsm at resist.ca

NATIONAL FILM BOARD OF CANADA NATIONAL BROADCAST PREMIERE OF TWO WORLDS
COLLIDING - THE STORY BEHIND THE NEIL STONECHILD INQUIRY
Nov. 18 2004

The National Film Board of Canada announces that the national broadcast
premiere of Two Worlds Colliding, written and directed by Tasha Hubbard,
airs on CBC Newsworld's Rough Cuts Thursday, December 9 and Saturday,
December 11 at 10pm and 1 am ET/PT.

Two Worlds Colliding chronicles the painful story of what came to be known
as Saskatoon's infamous "freezing deaths," and the schism between a
fearful, mistrustful Aboriginal community and a police force that must
come to terms with a shocking secret.

"This is an important time for Saskatoon - and Canada - as this is an
ongoing conflict, and at the heart of the conflict is denial and
misunderstanding of the First Nations' urban experience," said Hubbard, a
Cree adopted into a non-aboriginal family with a policing tradition. "I
think this film gives people a chance to hear from those most affected -
the families and the police themselves. It gives context to the reports we
hear in the media about the Stonechild inquiry. It's the story behind the
accusations and the findings."

One bone-chilling January night in 2000, Aboriginal man Darrell Night was
dumped in the outskirts of Saskatoon by two police officers. He was
stunned to hear that the frozen body of another Aboriginal man had been
discovered in the same remote area. A few days later another body was
found, just a few hundred metres away. When Night stepped forward, he set
into motion a chain of events that included a major RCMP investigation,
the conviction of the two officers, and an inquiry to determine whether
police had any involvement in an old case - the 1990 freezing death of
Neil Stonechild.

In this documentary, Night recounts his ordeal in a rare interview. The
parents of Lawrence Wegner, one of the dead men, poignantly talk about the
answers they seek. The sergeant who first believes Night's story and a
former RCMP officer brought in as a special investigator reveal the shame
they feel for their profession surrounding such incidents. Another police
chief is brought in to lead the Saskatoon force, but it remains to be seen
whether the gulf between two worlds can ever be bridged.

Last month, the Neil Stonechild inquiry concluded the Saulteaux teen found
frozen to death outside Saskatoon in 1990, had been in the custody of
Constables Brad Senger and Larry Hartwig the night he died. Police chief
Russ Sabo accepted the findings of the Inquiry and on Nov. 12, 2004 he
fired the two police officers from the Saskatoon Police Service. Senger
and Hartwig are appealing the decision.

Two Worlds Colliding is produced by Bonnie Thompson from the NFB's North
West Centre in Edmonton. The film is Hubbard's directorial debut and part
of the NFB's Aboriginal Filmmaking Program.

Now in its 65th year, the National Film Board of Canada has produced more
than 10,000 films and other audiovisual works, and won more than 4,500
awards - including 10 OscarsR. As Canada's public film producer, the NFB
produces and distributes distinctive, culturally diverse, challenging and
relevant audiovisual works that provide Canada and the world with a unique
Canadian perspective. To purchase NFB releases or for more information,

Do you believe this garbage?  It "says nothing to me about my life" (the
"Morrissey Test") -- and it doesn't even rhyme!  I would never buy this in a
book:



http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_lg_117_3.html



This one doesn't rhyme _or_ scan -- what a load of horse poopy!  What did
Rob Grenier write about singing from the diaphragm?  We should send this guy
back to Argentina!  Send _all_ of them back!



http://www.sculpture.org.uk/image/000000100100-0



This one doesn't even appear to be in American.  It's just numbers!  And
what is a "Carlos" anyway.  (I think this guy's gay.)  Modernism hasn't been
any good in twenty years.  Something there is that doesn't wub-a-dub:



http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/429
bg.jpg



What is this, some kind of f*cking joke?  I don't even think he _wrote_
this!  Olson would sue!  Wyndham Lewis would sue!  Google would sue!  (I had
to use my back button to get out of this one.)

Maybe this whole poetry thing isn't for me after all.  I think I'll stick to
pointing video cameras at skyscrapers and playing my iPod too loud in
church.  It's all so confusing, so. _demanding_ -- if only Robert Lowell
hadn't ruined it all by putting his lines in a book!



;)

States, however, differ significantly in white
fertility. The most fecund whites are in heavily
Mormon Utah, which, not coincidentally, was the only
state where Bush received over 70 percent. White women
average 2.45 babies in Utah compared to merely 1.11
babies in Washington, D.C., where Bush earned but 9
percent. The three New England states where Bush won
less than 40 percent—Massachusetts, Vermont, and Rhode
Island—are three of the four states with the lowest
white birthrates, with little Rhode Island dipping
below 1.5 babies per woman.

Bush carried the 19 states with the highest white
fertility (just as he did in 2000), and 25 out of the
top 26, with highly unionized Michigan being the one
blue exception to the rule. (The least prolific red
states are West Virginia, North Dakota, and Florida.)

In sharp contrast, Kerry won the 16 states at the
bottom of the list, with the Democrats’ anchor states
of California (1.65) and New York (1.72) having quite
infertile whites.

Among the 50 states plus Washington, D.C., white total
fertility correlates at a remarkably strong 0.86 level
with Bush’s percentage of the 2004 vote. (In 2000, the
correlation was 0.85.) In the social sciences, a
correlation of 0.2 is considered “low,” 0.4 “medium,”
and 0.6 “high.”

You could predict 74 percent of the variation in
Bush’s shares just from knowing each state’s white
fertility rate. When the average fertility goes up by
a tenth of a child, Bush’s share normally goes up by
4.5 points.<<

Someone stop this white ideological inbreeding
already! Cease and desist all this scandalous breeding
and propagating, for the love of humanity.

Brian I tried to view the poem/vispo on your site but my screen just went
blank -
I mean the poem that Ron was apparently talking about - I haven't seen Ron's
Blog lately but was interested - Ron can be very astute but he probably gets
too smart for his own boots at times - gets too finicky  - he's undoubteldy
a great poet - but then he is so deeply embedded on his Blog he is like a
hermite these days surrounded by masses of texts and books and dust and
peering through his prinz nez and muttering to himself (alas!) so re his
comments about you - I would take them/it with huge dollopps of salt and
codswollop !!

 Mind you  -  I dont know what I'm talking about* specifically as I havent
seen either  Ron's Blog to lately or your work!!  But in general I think the
following are problems to be looked at seriously in this controversy:

  1) that the fact Ron is related to Tennyson and

  2) he is (or thinks of himself as) the "Great Guru of Language Poetry" has
 probably gone to his head a bit.

As one probably has frequently noticed, white liberals are more prone to
saying, "Fuck-Off" in general, where Republicans, at least under their
breath can be heard saying or signaling "Fuck" to their fellow ideological
kind.

Though the facts are interesting here, the subject heading, "White guilt", I
find a counter-productive generic stereotype - no matter who uses it. It's
what you do, not what you is. So, in terms of the subject heading , to it I
say "F' Off"

Tom Wolfe wins bad sex award

Monday, December 13, 2004 Posted: 4:06 PM EST (2106 GMT)

LONDON, England (Reuters)  -- American author and journalist Tom Wolfe
won one of the world's most dreaded literary accolades on Monday -- the
British prize for bad sex in fiction.

The prize is awarded each year "to draw attention to the crude,
tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual
description in the modern novel."

Wolfe won it for a couple of purple passages from his latest novel "I
am Charlotte Simmons," a tale of campus life at an exclusive U.S.
university.

"Slither slither slither slither went the tongue," one of his winning
sentences begins.

"But the hand that was what she tried to concentrate on, the hand,
since it has the entire terrain of her torso to explore and not just
the otorhinolaryngological caverns -- oh God, it was not just at the
border where the flesh of the breast joins the pectoral sheath of the
chest -- no, the hand was cupping her entire right -- Now!"

Judges described Wolfe's prose as "ghastly and boring." Wolfe has said
in interviews he intended the book's sexual descriptions to be dry and
clinical.

The former newspaper correspondent, whose debut novel "Bonfire of the
Vanities" was a defining text of the 1980s, fought off stiff
competition from 10 other authors, including South African Andre Brink,
whose novel "Before I Forget" contains the following description of a
woman's vulva:

"(It was) like a large exotic mushroom in the fork of a tree, a little
pleasure dome if ever I've seen one, where Alph the sacred river ran
down to a tideless sea. No, not tideless. Her tides were convulsive, an
ebb and flow that could take you very far, far back, before hurling you
out, wildly and triumphantly, on a ribbed and windswept beach without
end."

Another writer who only narrowly escaped the prize was Britain's Nadeem
Aslam for his novel "Maps for Lost Lovers," a tale of life in a Muslim
community in an English town.

"His mouth looked for the oiled berry," one of his raunchiest passages
starts.

"The smell of his armpits was on her shoulders -- a flower depositing
pollen on a hummingbird's forehead," another reads.

The winner of the award, organized by the London-based Literary Review,
is given an Oscar-style statuette and a bottle of champagne -- but only
if he or she comes to the awards ceremony in person.

Organizers said Wolfe, who is based in New York, was the first writer
in the 12-year history of the competition to decline his invitation.

The Egyptian and Persian traditions of celebrating the return of the sun
merged in ancient Rome in a festival to the ancient god of seed-time,
Saturn.

The people gave themselves up to wild joy. The usual order of the year was
suspended:  grudges and quarrels forgotten, wars interrupted or postponed.
Rich and poor were equal, masters served slaves, children headed the family.
Cross-dressing and masquerades, merriment of all kinds prevailed.  A mock
king -- the Lord of Misrule -- was crowned.  Candles and lamps chased away
the spirits of darkness.

Mime-Version: 1.0

& midnight howls a storm                in this passage
we are but seeds scattered across                  distance to trace
figures in the finite            that extend             portraits of broken
symphonies
that are frozen in the gutter        to magazine clippings
of the next to dead             that slow march always present
we death a little I                                 & are planted in the
wind.

        I am not sure if I will ever make
Perfect sense of you again                      I can only guess
At the moment it arrives & my eyes wide open
Glaring down the screen saying to myself, I called you
To answer & answer each night does
Something to behold                               no wars to be fought here
The dead already                the entire universe
Just outside             touching the window tap tap               seeds

Seeds we are in         deeds we are covered by a thin layer
A hard capsule & inside as fluid as wind                     seeds
In a small confine we wait                  explode under proper
Conditions           water, sunlight
All of this notably absent              this night never ceases
The inner yerma or desert
                     It can never grow out of this particular solitude
That is why love is searching frantic through a maze of these lines
Each one nearer to rest         each one farther from the horizon
Discarded fragments                      concealed apologies
None of this matters                                     which is to say
It gets closer to poetry every time.

>>As one probably has frequently noticed, white
liberals are more prone to saying, "Fuck-Off" in
general, where Republicans, at least under their
breath can be heard saying or signaling "Fuck" to
their fellow ideological kind.

Though the facts are interesting here, the subject
heading, "White guilt", I find a counter-productive
generic stereotype - no matter who uses it. It's what
you do, not what you is. So, in terms of the subject
heading to it I say "F' Off"<<



Oh fuck I I guess I fucked up. Stereotype is as
stereotype does. Stereotype does as stereotype is.
Types fuck in stereo as fucked as I type? Oh no! White
 liberals prone and Republicans bone! Too much
Dalachinsky and my voice has fucked off down the road!


What’s left for the left to do but “Fuck and Run?”



While I agree entirely that “white guilt” is
unproductive, the post was titled in jest. But fuck me
for *making light of race.*

I guess.



The title was also a blatant nod to a much fraught
Minor Threat song of the same name.


But yes, the facts, the facts as you say are
interesting. 3 Cheers for the facts and one Fuck for
the name.

Meanwhile. . .   the quaint hum of rutting Republicans
rubbing their bums.

The link again, perhaps we can start fresh without
shame or guilt:

What is a woman of letters?

Is she only a human being?

Could she be a wife-beater, a family-abandoner, an alcoholic, a substance
abuser, a womanizer/adulterer? Would she then qualify as a true woman of
letters?

(Or is she simply an alphabet, for men of letters to play with? Is she
merely  an untreated psychological disorder? Who writes the qualifications?
Who says?)

This is the new math on the odds of the Bush suicides:
SEE:(http://www.suicidology.org/associations/1045/files/Suicide2002.pdf)

"Examining the male U.S. suicide rate for recent years, we can
extrapolate a conservative estimate of 17 male suicides per 100,000 people, or 0.017%.

"The odds of 4 specific, male biographers committing suicide would be the 4th power of 17/100000, or 8.3521 4.913 x 10^-17...roughly 1 chance 10,000,000,000,000,000.

"About as good a definition of impossible as you can get.

A person would stand a better chance of playing the Canadian lottery 6/49 exactly twice in one's lifetime and winning the grand jackpot BOTH TIMES!

(That is, picking 6 numbers out of 49 possible numbers and matching all 6 numbers out of 6 random draws, on 2 separate occasions, and having only purchased two Canadian lottery tickets ever.

one step    2 step
i step   yu  step

which country does laugh come from/
she asks
we are in the house of a painter by the seaside
where the famous poet is believed to temporarily reside
i take her ther to meet him
he needs a few days rest
it is a small space
that opens onto a large studio where the painter works
where world is evident
& friendship tread on w/caution

she screams & wakes only me
who has has never slept

when he who leads leaves
those who follow
do likewise

1/2 step up steps
re  step   steep step

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, if:=20

A man is known by the who he is and the what he has done;=20
And a woman is known for who and the what she owns and possesses...
(I offer .25cents cash to the person who can ID the author of the =
message...a healthy glass of quality wine to the person who not only =
knows who delivered the message but who can also answer the question: =
Why? =20

But, if the above is true, Then does it not follow:
that a man of letters must be known by his accomplishments
and a woman  of letters must be known by those whom she has =
accomplished?=20

Interesting thoughts here; too bad August has such singular/plural =

August: singular and plural in English must always be in =
agreement...work on that.

Is an actively accomplished woman who has passively accomplished no one
therefore a man of letters?
Why would a woman want to be a man of letters?
Must a woman be speyed before she is admitted into the house of litters?
Might a person of litters be known by their betters only for their leathers?
How does one tell which fetters might be the most accomplished?

Increasing Air Pollution Will Be a Top Priority for Bush Next Year:

Cheney Says Clean Air Overrated:

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

So there I am, just surfing along, when I come upon this crapola -- this
guy's a _writer_?  "E e e e e e e e e e e e"???  Noam, my chimpanzee, could
do this while rolling over and cutting the cheese.

http://collection.nlc-bnc.ca/100/200/300/chbooks/online/carnival/2a_05.html

(Those etymologist among us would notice that the name McCaffery is probably
Irish -- he would probably read this "A a a a a a a a a a a a".  The
literary among us would suspect a Joycean pun in there somewhere.  Either
way, it's hooey!)

And then there's this sh*t -- all monosyllables!  There isn't an allusion to
Dante or Lorine Niedecker in the whole run -- what happened to the
_American_ tradition.  And she's a woman to boot!  (Sorry that I haven't
mentioned any women yet in this post, I guess I'm just a bit imperfect, like
everybody.)  These lines would never work in a book -- that's why she has to
"dress them up" so to speak -- with lights and t-shirts!  Fat chance!

http://www.guerillaone.com/feature_artist_08_25/gallery_index.html

Blake would vomit.  Then call his lawyer.

This guy's clearly been looking at Rob Grenier -- where else would he get
this idea?  (And what did Grenier write about singing from the diaphragm?
You can't even _hum_ this.)  You call this a quatrain?  I call it FRAUD!

http://www.zwirnerandwirth.com/exhibitions/2002/112002Twombly/25.html

I thought I had put all this behind me -- and then I find this tripe!
Numbers again -- these poets are getting so a-political!  What a travesty of
the Language tradition.  Why, why, if I were editing an anthology now...
this guy would be banned to the Poetics section.  I don't care if he gave me
a ride to a Stephen Rodefer reading in Berkeley 1974 once, when my wife was
sleeping and the baby and Kathleen were sleeping -- all saliva under the
bridge!  Basta!

http://ger-www.uia.ac.be/webger/ger/joyce/livre.html

There's a grand canyon of difference between the tight quatrains of Kit
Robinson and this turgid mess, which looks like it was written _by_ a
computer _for_ a computer.  I think I may have to give up poetry after all.

Do Service Changes Puzzle You?

perhaps morals and their systems were mutations
to begin with chum, in a bucket, seducing sharks
for one of a billion photo-ops teeth flashing
sustained analysis being a degradation of why we fight
o lord, the train to your pantry needs black gold
ogling the gesture of defiance, sometimes it takes
decades of brutality you've financed to see a dirty dog
drunk, coming at me, second time that I got home
drunk as I could be, there's another mule in the stable
where my mule oughta be, let me tell you about
the way he's not there

I watched Mr. Robert Creeley sign the back of my ticket once to see him
read at Naropa. He knew it was weird and he signed it anyway. I always
thought of him as a professional after that.

At the same time I saw Allen Ginsberg sign the bottom of a blank
letter-size page for a kid who was a maniac (this was the year before
his death). It was for a letter of recommendation. Allen said "I'll sign
the paper -- you fill-in whatever you want me to say about you!"

August,

Is this a poem?  Because the question is inane.  Art is art and people are people.  They have something to do with each other, but not much.  Dickens was quite the humanist in his books, but he was rather beastly to his wife.  We don't judge a building on whether the architect was a bad father.

and the term, "man of letters" is rather out of date.  that would be what Foucault would have called a universal intellectual.  we're pretty much all, men and women, specific intellectuals now, which means we are technical boys and girls (thank you, William Gibson, my fellow southerner in the Northwest).

August <litob@SAN.RR.COM> wrote:
What is a man of letters?



Is he judged only by his work?

Or should his personal and private life be taken into consideration?

Should writers be highly evolved human beings/men as well as a man of letters, or is professional achievements enough

Should writers be held to a higher standard of evaluation than other people?

Can a man be a man letters AND an have an untreated psychological disorder? Or does he need to have his disorder treated to be a true man of letters?

Can he be a wife-beater, a family-abandoner, an alcoholic, a substance abuser, a womanizer/adulterer and still be a man of letters?

What makes a poet/writer qualify as a true man of letters?

Only his accomplishments as a writer?

Or also his character as a human being?

TOMORROW NIGHT



The SRI Presents FINAL New Research Talks:

Who: Charles Mudede, "The Cinema of Lovesickness: An Examination of Police Beat,
the Movie." &

Robert Corbett, "My Demographic: The Madonna-Britney Problem, or A Proposal for
Imaginary Social Research"

Where: Gallery of the Senses, 1402 E. Pike St. (just above the American
Artificial Limb Co.)

When: Wednesday, December 15 @ 7:30 P.M.

Donations welcome

Contact: Robert Corbett, Coordinating Director, Seattle Research Institute
Email: robert@seattleresearchinstitute.org;
Phone: 206.992.6112


The second New Research Series coordinated by the SRI concludes with two talks:
one by a Seattle film reviewer and police reporter on his experience making a
local movie, spawned by his column in the Stranger, and the other by a
humanities researcher about a proposal to study the “imaginary social,” focused
on “the Madonna-Britney” problem. Each talk will last approximately 30 minutes
and there will be a question and answer period after both have presented. Free
beverages, condiments and possibly cheese will be available before, during and
after the talks, as well as selected publications of the SRI.

BIOGRAPHIES

CHARLES TONDERAI MUDEDE is a Zimbabwe native educated in the US. Mudede views
American crime, both in his journalism and in POLICE BEAT, through an African
perspective, infusing his work with a unique philosophical, poetic and often
humorous tone unseen in American crime reporting. He is also Associate Editor
for The Stranger, and, in addition to his journalistic work, writes for them as
a film, book and music critic. Mudede’s work has also appeared in The Village
Voice, The New York Times, C Theory, Radical Urban Theory, Ars Electronica and
Nest Magazine, among others publications. Mudede is also a founding member of
the Seattle Research Institute and co-author with Diana George of “Last Seen,”
a book published by the Artspeak Gallery in Vancouver, BC. Mudede and the
co-writer and director of Police Beat, Robinson Devor and Mudede were named
fellows at the Sundance Institute for a previous script, SUPER POWER, where it
was developed at their Screenwriters Lab. The two are currently
rewriting SUPER POWER, and will begin developing it in earnest after the release
of POLICE BEAT.

ROBERT CORBETT is coordinating researcher for the Seattle Researcher and, with
Rebecca Brown, editor of EXPERIMENTAL THEOLOGY. His essay (though he prefers
the term “teaching”) Wide Margin appears in the SRI’s BOOKMARKS series, edited
by Megan Purn and Brian Goedde. He does have publications elsewhere, including
on the web, though he is given to referring to himself as “Old School.” He has
numerous projects in the works, one of which is a complete bibliography of the
books he has yet to write. He came to Seattle as a graduate student and mildly
regrets that he spent the early 90s reading postmodern novels and romantic
poetry. He now works for a large research university in an obscure capacity,
so in a sense, nothing has changed since only a few people (and certainly not
his family) understand what he does. MY DEMOGRAPHIC is his first attempt at
sociology.

ABOUT THE SRI

The Seattle Research Institute is an association of Northwest writers,
intellectuals and artists seeking socially engaged inquiry. SRI produces and
promotes well-orchestrated collusions between experimental aesthetics and
revolutionary thought. In its short and virtual existence it has published two
anthologies and a series of “Bookmarks”—short, plangent pieces to distract the
reader from other books—as well a coordinated a series of talks about new
Research, by people in disciplines as disparate as organizational biology and
clinical sex therapy. More information about the SRI can be found at
www.seattleresearchinstitute.org.




All,

This constitutes more than my usual self-promotion, but there it is.  Come see me and Charles Mudede present in the last ever evening of the SRI's New Research series -- ever.  As usual, it will be on the middle Wednesday at the Gallery of the Senses, which is just above the American Artificial Limb storefront.

I sent this out from SRI last week, but a reminder so cadre are aware, and so you can send it to your friends (and enemies if this makes you happy).   Feel free to edit as you see fit for your audience.  I'll be seeing a reminder from SRI next Monday.  And by the way, Charles' film (with Robinson Devor) made it into Sundance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



The SRI Presents Two New Research Talks:

Who: Charles Mudede, "The Cinema of Lovesickness: An Examination of Police Beat, the Movie." &

Robert Corbett, "My Demographic:  The Madonna-Britney Problem, or A Proposal for Imaginary Social Research"

Where:  Gallery of the Senses, 1402 E. Pike St. (just above the American Artificial Limb Co.)

When:  Wednesday, December 15 @ 7:30 P.M.

Donations welcome

Contact:  Robert Corbett, Coordinating Director, Seattle Research Institute
Email: robert@seattleresearchinstitute.org; Phone: 206.992.6112



The second New Research Series coordinated by the SRI concludes with two talks:  one by a Seattle film reviewer and police reporter on his experience making a local movie, spawned by his column in the Stranger, and the other by a Seattle humanities researcher on his proposal to study what he willfully calls the “imaginary social,” focused on what he obscurely calls “the Madonna-Britney” problem.  Each talk will last approximately 30 minutes and there will be a question and answer period after both have presented.  Free beverages, condiments and possibly cheese will be available before, during and after the talks, as well as selected publications of the SRI.

Biographies

Charles Mudede is a Zimbabwe native educated in the US, Mudede views American crime, both in his journalism and in POLICE BEAT, through an African  perspective, infusing his work with a unique philosophical, poetic  and often humorous tone unseen in American crime reporting.  He is also Associate Editor for The Stranger, and, in addition to his journalistic work, writes for them as a film, book and music critic. Mudede’s work has also appeared in The Village Voice, The New York Times, C Theory, Radical Urban Theory, Ars Electronica and Nest Magazine, among others publications. Mudede is also a founding member of the Seattle Research Institute and co-author with Diana George of “Last Seen,” a book  published by the Artspeak Gallery in Vancouver, BC. Mudede and the co-writer and director of Police Beat, Robinson Devor and Mudede were named fellows at the Sundance Institute for a previous script, SUPER POWER, where it was developed at their Screenwriters Lab. The two are current
 ly
 rewriting SUPER POWER, and will begin developing it in earnest after the release of POLICE BEAT.

Robert Corbett is coordinating researcher for the Seattle Researcher and, with Rebecca Brown, editor of EXPERIMENTAL THEOLOGY.   His essay (though he prefers the term “teaching”) Wide Margin appears in the SRI’s BOOKMARKS series, edited by Megan Purn and Brian Goedde.  He does have publications elsewhere, including on the web, though he is given to referring to himself as “Old School.”  He has numerous projects in the works, one of which is a complete bibliography of the books he has yet written.  He came to Seattle as a graduate student and mildly regrets that he spent the early 90s reading postmodern novels and romantic poetry.  He now works for a large research university in an obscure capacity, so in a sense, nothing has changed since only a few people (and certainly not his family) understand what he does.  MY DEMOGRAPHIC is an attempt to get out of what he calls the academic closet, but probably it is mostly about his detestation for (and envy of) David Brooks.

About the SRI

The Seattle Research Institute is an association of Northwest writers, intellectuals and artists seeking socially engaged inquiry. SRI produces and promotes well-orchestrated collusions between experimental aesthetics and revolutionary thought.  In its short and virtual existence it has published two anthologies and a series of “Bookmarks”—short, plangent pieces to distract the reader from other books—as well a coordinated a series of talks about new Research, by people in disciplines as disparate as organizational biology and clinical sex therapy.  More information about the SRI can be found at www.seattleresearchinstitute.org.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I agree with you. 'man of letters' reminds me of lld, phd, as well as
other classicist notions, something out of the drawing room.

The idea of the 'true man of letters' is even more insidious, more
divisive.

From an ACLU bulletin forwarded by Diane DiPrima:


Do you want FBI agents following you or your neighbors into your churches,
synagogues or mosques and documenting what goes on there? Recently released
documents indicate that FBI agents have been spying on innocent people unde=
r
guidelines relaxed by Attorney General John Ashcroft. Ashcroft restructured
these guidelines -- without consultation with Congress -- to allow FBI
agents to spy on religious and political activity even if there was no
suspicion of criminal activity.

Ashcroft's new guidelines revoked long-standing protections from government
abuse and there is evidence that the FBI and local police are using this
opportunity to spy on environmental, political and faith-based groups. This
spying is not only unnecessary but also invasive of personal privacy. The
police should not spy on individuals because they attended a rally
supporting better funding for their child=92s school or they expressed
discontent with the government=92s policy toward Sudan.

In recent days, thanks to your hard work, many of the most grievous parts o=

the intelligence reform bill were stripped out. While the final bill has
several problems, without the outcry against several of its dangerous
provisions by concerned people like you, it would have been much worse. We

hey how about website monitoring? The website I edit has over 25 unique
visits a month from US Government "visitors" is this a good use of our tax
dollars?  How about the fact that our local Catholic Worker house in Chicago
Su Casa was infiltrated by
Chicago Police? We are living in a time like the 1920's without Ashcroft is
the new Mitchell Palmer.  The bottom line is no one really cares- as long as
'terror' is confronted.

I urge people of good will to fight these intrusions and violation of our

This is for some a difficult question to answer substantially.

Croggon gave an answer that went in a gender direction, where it began =
to morph into a diatribe, while she could have simply added "women of =
letters"

Andrews gave a humourous/silly answer

Saliby gave a pedagogic answer, focusing on the singular/plural =
inconsistencies in my email instead of the substance of the questions =
themselves

Corbett writes that my question is "inane" and sites some "authorities". =


Not too civilized or sophisticated.

This is very interesting.


I wonder if it's possible for someone on this list to answer these =
questions seriously without being critical of the way that I asked them =
or using judgemental adjectives.

I would say that from what I have learned so far is that a man of =
letters does not stray from the question, or make it frivolous, or =
criticize the grammar of the question or use judgemental, pejorative =
adjectives toward the questioner.

Dalachinsky gave me the simplest and most direct answer, which has given =
me more to reflect about.

I believe that a man/woman of letters is someone who not only is a =
professional in his/her work but also in his/her discourse.

Someone who is never too busy to answer questions that are motivated by =
a sincere desire to understand.

Not to busy with promoting a new book or a book signing. Someone who =
gives equal importance to answering the sincere questions of a young =
writer as much as he gives importance to posting the obit of an =
octogenerian writer whose name was rarely if at all mentioned on this =
list while he was still alive.

I am very curious to see how this journey in understanding, this search =
for clear answers from a man/woman of letters pans out.

Women are familiar with the universal "neutral" gender which magically
conceals a prick and balls, the "it" which turns out to be exclusively male,
after all.  We can neither ignore gender nor not ignore it.  It's that old
boring stale double bind.  To speak is to "diatribe".  Not to speak is to
drift along with the same old same old.

Augie, don't take this personally, as it's not meant personally; as a
writer, surely you have some duty to be attentive to the details and
implications of language?  Might this not be, in fact, where that morality
you're asking about actually lives?  You have no idea how much it depressed
me to see a post like that "man of letters" thing up here, though I guess
it's not just that but the present wholesale gallop back to the 1950s.
Brian Kim Stefans' satirical remark on forgetting to mention women ("who's
perfect?") is beside the point.  It's not about hurriedly making sure
there's a gender parity so you don't appear to be sexist: that's just
dressing, as is the hasty addition of "woman of letters".  That doesn't
redress the actual problem, which is that well-defined phenomenon of
creating a self by defining oneself against an other, to that other's
detriment.

In this case, it's an idea of writer or poet which constructs itself as
implicitly and/or explicitly male - it possesses a woman of some kind, it
behaves badly or in other ways with machismo and derring do, or it claims
the serious manly intellectual role, it claims the "feminine" as being other
than writerly/active, but as passive and "soft" and without "balls".  There
are a million variations, most of them homophobic to some degree.  And so -
logically, as Robert points out - a woman can be nothing except "feminine",
right?  Or else she's a shrill, humourless bitch who's wearing the pants and
possesses lots of coarse body hair and probably needs a good fuck to rid her
of that extra phallus. &c&c&c.

O yawn.  It's so old.  It makes me think of all those caricatures of
suffragettes in the 19C press.

Btw, I would not necessarily like to meet every writer I admire.

All the best

It is creeping fascism - but it is good your newspaper Pierre is writing
that - you shouldnt turn your back on it just becasue an editorial supported
the death penalty (the Death Penalty is terrible I read a book about it the
actual process of killing someone is often "botched") - you might find
 that - eg - the Sub Editor disagrees. In NZ the NZ Herald is traditionally
liberal to Right Wing but reading it carefully a lof of information is
gained eg I read in there of an Iraqi AP (journalist - who witnessed the
killing of (at least one) family trying to cross the river outside Fallujah
by a US Helicopter gunship. All five were killed.  he didnt wait around to
see howmantyoters wre dlliberatly murdered by the military.

(The military have a big interest in keeping wars going -its their bread and
butter)

But re the Anti-Terrorist laws - the Homeland Security Law (or similar)  of
the US which are really laws made to terrorise and divide the people of the
US and other countres - has spread to Australia and NZ - in NZ a very
similar law(s) is on the books - and more are creeping in.

One effect was the arrest and imprisonment without trial for two two years
of Ahmed Zaoui who was a refugee from Algeria - via France Belgium
Switzerland Malaysia and sought asylum in New Zealand thinking that we are
good on human rights well we are or rather - we used to be  - the Government
has adopted the Anti-terrorist laws into legislation and Ahmed Zaoui was not
allowed a trial - still hasn't got a trial and after months of Imrsonment in
Paremoremo (High Security Prison - where he was in solitary confinement for
many months - infact he was mistreated badly there it is a terrible place)
has finally got bail, and is out - but the Supreme Court of NZ had to fight
the NZ Government which is realtively "liberal" . The Prime Minister Helen
Clarke was enraged he got bail and wants to toughen up the laws. Her
Government also sent back a young woman to Sri Lanka to a terrible
situation - and to a place where she had been raped.)  No one in the labour
Party of NZ ever visited or communicated with Ahmed Zaoi but member of  The
Green Party (who share power with Labour did - in particular Keith Locke).

It is clear that the Military dictatorship of Algeria working with French
and US Secret Services  had informed the NZ Secret Service - the SIS as  a
document by them - never revealed - was cited as provng he was threat to
NZ's National Security  (if he is a threat to anyone so is my cat a threat
to National Security)- it is NZ's Guantanamo Bay - Zaoui is free and part of
the suprt that helped free him came from NZ Poets - in fact a friend of
mine )(Editor of 'Brief' -  publised a poem by Zaoui written while in jail
and tarnslated by an Auckland poet Riemke Ensing with help form people who
know Arabic.

Ahmed Zaoui was a member of parliament or FIS, a Moslem party, which was
democratically elected then supressed by a military regime now in Algeria -
his life wasin danger - but reagrlesof al that he should have had a trial -
to date he hasnt been accusedonof anything - as also have none of those in
Guantanamo.

The lies of Bush about the war, Abu Graib (uncoverd by the journalist who
also revealed the Mai Lai massacre), other atrocities, the conspicous
reluctance to try Suddam Hussein (famously seen shaking Rumsford's hand),
the obvious non - desire to "capture" Osama bin Laden - the use of napalm on
civilians in Iraq - the fear mongering and attempts to suppress what people
read - the US and other countrues are heading toward fascism.

As the liberal Germans found one morning - they woke up to No Rights and
their Jewish friends had disappeared - no trial date was set for them.

Things are bad indeed if in my loal newspaper, the "Times Useless" of
Albany NY (a basic right wing Hearst paper -- we have refused to let
its ink blacken our doorstep since it jubilantly welcomed the return of
the death penalty in NY state a few years back -- tho I picked up a

bleeding liberal editorial re freedom of expression like the one this

  "The Treasury Department bars publishing books by dissidents without a
license

  First published: Tuesday, December 14, 2004

  In better times, the odd notion of a book banned in the United States
would come about, perhaps, because of an unenlightened school board or
a rash group of public library trustees. They'd back down, often
enough. Even if they didn't, their authority would be narrow enough
that few people, if any at all, could actually be kept from reading
"Catcher in the Rye," "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," or just
whatever the inappropriate book of the moment was. Instead, all that
attention had a way of making such treasures of literature more popular
than ever.

Censorship on that scale suddenly seems quaint by the standards of the
federal government's grotesque interpretation and troubling enforcement
of the World War I era "Trading With the Enemy Act."

  The Treasury Department has taken to barring American companies from
publishing works by dissident writers in countries on a government
blacklist -- Iran, Sudan, Cuba, North Korea and, until recently, Iraq
-- without first obtaining special approval. That means books banned in
the very sort of totalitarian countries where that's an accepted
practice are effectively banned as well in the United States, which is
supposed to be where the world's standard is set for free expression.

The reasoning, flawed as it is, goes like this. Even the publication of
a candid account of life in these countries, of the sort that never
would be permitted there, would somehow benefit an enemy regime.

One reporter, Scott Martelle of The Associated Press, has suggested
that if such a legal atmosphere had prevailed a half-century ago, Boris
Pasternak's book, "Doctor Zhivago," exposing the evils of Stalinism
would have been banned by the Americans after it was banned by the
Soviets.

As Ellen Goodman says in an article on the facing page, this misguided
policy has among its recent casualties Shirin Ebadi of Iran, the 2003
Nobel Peace Prize winner. Her story of persevering through Iran's
Islamic revolution and then defending human rights in its courts can't
be published or distributed here, at least not without a special
license.

Yes, a license -- to have a book published. Apparently no one at the
Treasury Department understands either the irony or redundancy here.
Permission to publish a book is guaranteed under the First Amendment to
the Constitution. That, at least, will always be our reading of it --
as long, that is, as the Constitution itself doesn't end up on some
banned book list.

And no, Ms. Ebadi isn't about to apply for such a license. She is,
however, suing the Treasury Department in federal court. Imagine if she
wins, and we then can all read about it.

This is a law that can't be allowed to stand."

The octogenerian in question was udnoubtedly a ocnsiderable poet but he had
had his innings - quite a knock - he (Monsieur Jackons Maclow (sounds like
an abstract expressionist Macdonald burger!!) was a card carrying language
poet August and I found his poems from memory rather dry - interesting i
suppose but not sure he was very talented  - which is not to imply that the
language poets were all "dry", or untalented.

 Some of your work is better than Jackson MacLow's - his idea was
"controlled chance operatons" which was similar to Cage's - I just looked at
some of his stuff and he was probably/or possibly very talented (I saw
photo of him  a few years back and he looked more dead than a live - like
death beginning to be heated up -....bit of a "worry") - but Corbett and
others should take an interest in poets who are writing now such as yourself
and Ian and Steven Dalchinsky etc and give encouragement - it takes courage
to speak out and ask questions - inane or other.

The better approach is to enter into the spirit of things  - Alan is
paranoid about anti-Semitismn  and probably thinks that  "A Man of Letters"
is a code for a Nazi!  (Just joking)...

Trouble with the Langpos and their descendents is not that they are not
often quite brilliant but that  - with some healthy exceptions - they are
mostly terribly dour and humourless.

Life is to be lived and poetry and art and letters are just things to be
consumed or done from time to time - life matters - art is irrelevant. If we
cant live together and extend compassion to each other poetry is useless.
Corbett is wrong - a poet is hard  - very hard - to separate from his/her
work. In some cases they become their work - or they check out and become
mad or arrogant.  They forget to love themlselves or others.

This is for some a difficult question to answer substantially.

Croggon gave an answer that went in a gender direction, where it began to
morph into a diatribe, while she could have simply added "women of letters"

Andrews gave a humourous/silly answer

Saliby gave a pedagogic answer, focusing on the singular/plural
inconsistencies in my email instead of the substance of the questions
themselves

Corbett writes that my question is "inane" and sites some "authorities".

Not too civilized or sophisticated.

This is very interesting.


I wonder if it's possible for someone on this list to answer these questions
seriously without being critical of the way that I asked them or using
judgemental adjectives.

I would say that from what I have learned so far is that a man of letters
does not stray from the question, or make it frivolous, or criticize the
grammar of the question or use judgemental, pejorative adjectives toward the
questioner.

Dalachinsky gave me the simplest and most direct answer, which has given me
more to reflect about.

I believe that a man/woman of letters is someone who not only is a
professional in his/her work but also in his/her discourse.

Someone who is never too busy to answer questions that are motivated by a
sincere desire to understand.

Not to busy with promoting a new book or a book signing. Someone who gives
equal importance to answering the sincere questions of a young writer as
much as he gives importance to posting the obit of an octogenerian writer
whose name was rarely if at all mentioned on this list while he was still
alive.

I am very curious to see how this journey in understanding, this search for
clear answers from a man/woman of letters pans out.

Thanks Richard, I appreciated your courage, humor, and irreverence.
Straightforward and simple are a neat way to communicate. When I hear the  expression
"man of letters" I think of kabbalism. When someone says art and/vs.  living I
feel like those are words that can't even be defined. The dissection of
sentences and words into abstractions and word play is driven by the fact that
language as a whole is inadequate for expression much of the time. So to
continue using the words as art, the poet breaks them down into components until
we're looking at electrons and quanta, not the interaction and connection of
wholeness. As communicators and translators we should be striving for more
cognizance, not veering away from it. Art is not restrictive, but whether or not
we're actually trying to communicate something or creating art for art's sake
is  the secret of the artist. But is it language? I know an unknown poet who
does  nothing but try to find the most precise and concise words to convey
meaning.  The meaning always flows; but since words have been so hexed, unsalted,
and  perverted, he has to put them back together like a spell or enchantment.
He'll most likely remain obscure for that very reason. Laura Riding abandoned
 poetry precisely for it's lack of precision and ability to convey meaning.
Some  writers do the opposite. Others give up and create art.  Mary

Well it was Michael Rothenberg's house that burned down.  Do you think

Maybe he doesn't want more stuff but books are books: windows and doors.
His temporary address is below if anyone would like to use it.

Ironically, I believe Michael is on the Board of "Poets In Need" - which, as
much as I can, I am always happy to make a contribution. I believe Leslie
Scalapino, Norman Fisher and Lyn Hejinian are also on the Board. Leslie, I
believe is on this list, and I will copy this note Lyn. I am sure they will
be happy to post information as to who folks can make a contribution there.

I like Mairead's "send" a book to Michael idea - to help replace his
Library. I suspect we should wait to hear to see when Michael can take in
any new tangibles - given a burnt house.

Greetings,

My new book of poems, Cleavage is out from Roof Books
and available from Small Press Distribution at
http://www.spdbooks.org/ and/or directly from the
publisher at http://www.roofbooks.com/

Structured like an ABC, Cleavage is an homage and
celebration of modern femininity.  No altar pieces to
enshrine us; instead an alphabet of rapturous, comical
and scandalous voices.  From Laure to Tristessa, Nadja
to Justine, en passant par the riot and diva girls and
more.  Check it out!

peace,
Chris Tysh

I guess we can add "Hush" Medals to "Hush" Money as standard operating
procedure with Bush & Co. One can only imagine that both Bremer (Coalition
Authority!) and Tenet (CIA??) were being offered huge book, etc. contracts
to spell the beans on the story of the disaster in Iraq.

Such a clever way to cut off their tongues with high Medals for their
contributions to this glorious victory in Iraq. Those awards must have
stopped them in their tracks with each one of them on their way to Random
House to collect $10 mil advances,

Now did Rove come up with this solution, or Cheney, or Rumsfeld or
Wolfolitz? Each one of them has a lot to hide.

I just had an idea that if I was a soldier in Falujeh, I would start sending
these gentlemen stones - from demolished mosques, shops, homes and schools -
individually packaged in body bags. Direct to the White House and Pentagon.

It's all really scandalous and disgusting. Who can believe this stuff,
anywhere? Wow.

O Canada? Separating myth from reality
<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    In one of the more violent confrontations with the police around the
    Fine Arts Museum - the police were using pepper spray and batons to
    beat
    down protestors trying to push back the barricades -, a disturbing
    rendition of Canada's national anthem was initiated by a few people in
    the crowd and soon spread like wildfire. These protestors belted out
    the tunes of O Canada, while some even simultaneously placed their
    hands
    over their hearts evoking their "true patriot love". Presumably, the
    intent was to impute "Canadian-ness" to the protestors, implying
    that the police were behaving in a "non-Canadian" manner. The irony,
    of course, is that many on the front lines battling against the
    police have little sympathy for the Canadian state (or its police
    forces), as it is this state which has consistently sought to
    marginalise and criminalise their dissent....Black people who have
    either recently arrived to Canada or those who can trace their
    ancestry back many generations within Canada can readily attest to
    the systemic and institutional racism that characterises Canadian
    society. ......Black people in Canada continue to be removed from
    the historical and cultural landscape. They do appear as a blip on
    the radar screen when they are used to display Canada's role in
    facilitating their escape from American slavery through the
    Underground Railway.

transgress

you in your universe
me in  mine
at the border
that can never be crossed
we speak we write
for  peace or war
if we want to know
we stay
go deep
yet never violate  the onlyness
skin & words . . .
we can't or won't
cover one  another
out in the cold
we cut and slash
with swords of both  kinds
then turn the blade upon ourselves
in from the cold
but  comfortably numb
loitering at warm boundaries
looking back at the outpost  campfires
drifting
closer to the edge . . .

The party moved round to other houses and apartments. The music played.
Fuchx was walking down the street and was going to sit by the centre. He
sat up on the bench en remember the high en low victims voices thét ran
through his head. The ill dope plan. He lookt out ova to the track field
en played wiph the Was. The duppy had told it en foretold it. Maybe More

to boot for them. He get a smoke or 2 from it, maybe, a beer. So most
time he think he got lots of friends. Not one of them was his age.

    The room had an ol dude layin on the couch wiph More sittin at his
feet. It was a room somewhere on..., in some house, somewhere, thét look
like it all normal on the outside en cracktout on the in. More waited
wiph Lil Burg.  Those dudes soon come to come out from behind this iron
door hiding two dudes en hella stuff. [Go run en pick up again. ...en
again en...] Some hopped up ol wore-out  ho, wiph connects from the old
dayes, was stressin ova shit. Figured she take a cab en hook up some
other place.
    Some other kids were watchin Veteranos en Gone in 60 Seconds on two
different sets as Loc to the Brain played, kinda low, from a Sony
portable. They blah'd en yah'd en suckt back yai en bud as they blew

    ...en some young pretty hardass bitches stood roun not breakin a
smile en could match the deadmen, dead for dead, in the maddoggin
showdown.  [en some got put on track] Then there were one or two olders
wiph no fashion sense holdin a bad odor who seem to run everythin. It
seemed the higher you climbed up the worse you had to look.
    The door opened en a big caveman  comeout  followin Løcel.  Løcel
stept up to the two waddys,
-You got to go meet them at the Micky D's jus ova down the street. They

Mr. Wirth


Mr. Wirth, I said, a penny for your thoughts.

Wirth slowly turned in my direction, his face blank, whiskey in hand.

Aye, that you should know less than that, he replied. Some things let to
quieten, I believe.

I couldn't answer. Ever since Wirth appeared in the midst of our little group,
things hadn't been the same. It was difficult to figure precisely what the
matter was, or to be sure, what the matter was with Wirth, but there was matter
to be sure.

I murmured something about the weather, only to be met, once again, by silence.

And silence ruled the little bar on the heights overlooking the sea, until I
shuffed my chair about, and left the premises. The long path home beckoned me,
and I would be at the worries, once again.

Hi,

Michael asked me to type that as a board member of Poets in Need, he
cannot receive any funds given to that organization. If you'd like to

hey who wrote hiawatha  anyway?  was it a man of letters?
sorry for messin this up mary jo


undress

you in your verse
me in  mine
at the border of distress
that crossed its t's
& dotted its g's
we speak we whine
by the shores of gichi gumi
by the somethin or other waters
there lived a chief named hiawatha
and his 2 half naked daughters
if we want to know
we say   we want to know
tho must of us just act like we already know
go deep  but not really deep enough
more like surfing
and pretending we're scubba diving
yet always violate  the onlyness
skin & words . . .
we can't or won't
cover one  another
out in the cold like pocahontas
we cut and slash
with q-tips
then turn the swabs upon ourselves
in from the cold
but  comfortably dumb
loitering at warm    bindings
looking back at the outpost  campfires
drifting
closer to the edge . . .beads of light on our  croak  us'
even the  horizon  winces
but now
the world is ours

There's a lot of unjust laws that we can't do anything about,
but I sincerely hope the other board members of this organization
will consider either changing their laws, or making an exception
in such a case of obvious need as this.

if i were a man
of letters     or woman
or what     i could be
all mixed up
with a funny walk
or limp


Seriously, I just finished a 26-poem sequence about the alphabet or I'm not
sure if it's about the alphabet or, rather, inspired by the alphabet, but I
think I qualify, nonetheless.

Last night I spoke with Michael. He wanted me to tell you that he's very
touched by the concern and generosity of the people on the List who have
offered to help him. He was particularly thrilled about receiving books
because the fire destroyed his library. As a co-founder and board member of
Poets in Need, Michael can't receive funds from the organization without
creating an appearance of conflict of interest. Although I don't know Suzi
Winson, I'm sure that people will be able to donate funds to Michael without
doing it through Poets in Need. I don't know Suzi
Winson, but will try to reach her for more information and either she or I
will forward it to the list

As Jonathan Penton wrote, Suzi Winson is the contact person for
contributions to Michael. I'll repeat her e-mail address:

fishdrum@earthlink.net

Michael told me that he is receiving a lot of community support. The fire
was a major event in Pacifica. Local officials appear to be sympathetic to
his situation and some people are organizing benefits for him. Obviously,
his own manuscripts and Whalen materials are irreplaceable, but books will
help rebuild his library and money will offset his financial losses and the
accumulating expenses of living in a hotel instead of a home.

If you'd like to help Michael, contact Suzi Winson. I'll try to reach her to
get more information and post it to the List. Perhaps Jonathan Penton, my
"partner in crime" and in helping a good friend, will also gather some
information to pass along to you.

At this moment, events supporting Michael in California are taking shape.
The organizing process will take some time. I'll do my best to keep you
informed.

in this forest
primely evil
mumbling whine-os &  prozac
hides
a blue rose
indistinct in the twilight . . .
polluted  lake erie
for hiawatha
no head dress
black robes covered that  song
for evangeline
no haut couture
only widows weeds
for my hill  daddy
no bagpipes
for cherokee
only trail of tears
for catholic  frauline
luthers & hitlers the true believers
threw them all
into  the dumpster
but pieces of eight
hang out at
alchemical  borders
bloody peaces of success
these stones of little worth
blue  beads . . .
only
fathomless
non-plundered
nonplussed
under the  moonshine
still warm enough
free from crucifix of wife-hood
free from  marriage-dom crown
a woman of email
the internet is ours
thank the  flesh
blessed transgress

hey  who wrote hiawatha  anyway?  was it a man of letters?
sorry for  messin this up mary jo

undress

you in your verse
me in  mine
at the border of distress
that  crossed its t's
& dotted its g's
we speak we whine
by the shores of  gichi gumi
by the somethin or other waters
there lived a chief named  hiawatha
and his 2 half naked daughters
if we want to know
we  say   we want to know
tho must of us just act like we already  know
go deep  but not really deep enough
more like surfing
and  pretending we're scubba diving
yet always violate  the onlyness
skin  & words . . .
we can't or won't
cover one  another
out in the  cold like pocahontas
we cut and slash
with q-tips
then turn the swabs  upon ourselves
in from the cold
but  comfortably dumb
loitering at  warm    bindings
looking back at the outpost   campfires
drifting
closer to the edge . . .beads of light on our   croak  us'
even the  horizon  winces
but now
the world  is ours

you in your universe
me in mine
at the border
that can never be  crossed
we speak we write
for peace or war
if we want to know
we  stay
go deep
yet never violate the onlyness
skin & words . .  .
we can't or won't
cover one another
out in the cold
we cut and  slash
with swords of both kinds
then turn the blade upon ourselves
in  from the cold
but comfortably numb
loitering at warm boundaries
looking  back at the outpost campfires
drifting
closer to the edge . . .
event  horizon

i know this is probably more work than michael can undertake at this
moment, but are there specific books he really wants replaced,
besides our sending whatever we want/can?

If you're in or around New Orleans this weekend, the place to be is the
Mermaid Lounge, Saturday, 6 - midnight, for a lively festival of video and
art installations and multi-media performances.

I don't have a list of the other performers, but among many others on the
bill will be J. Hammons, a wonderful dancer, who will perform to a reading
of my newest work "The Body is a Mind" and the electronic music of Jeffrey
Harrington.

It should be an extraordinary & fun event, and poignant as well, since very
soon the Mermaid Lounge will be closing its doors forever.

Camille Martin

Saturday, 12/18
6 pm - midnight

Dear Maria and all,

Vernon's post below is very helpful.  I had thought of sending signed
books, or books with dedications.  I don't know if replacement is
possible so I thought: maybe something new.

But the good thing about help is: It can come in many forms.

Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

i know this is probably more work than michael can undertake at this
moment, but are there specific books he really wants replaced,
besides our sending whatever we want/can?

I want to thank UCSD's Archive for New Poetry, which is part of the
Mandeville Special Collections Library, and especially Matthew Peters,
Lynda Claassen, and Rob Melton, who have provided an extraordinary on-line
archive of Hannah Weiner's writing. Patrick Durgen has been the overall
editor of the project, and it is another example of his superb and much
appreciated work on Weiner's papers. Be sure to read his introductory essay.

UCSD has now made available about 500 pages of Weiner's ms, mostly writing
that has not yet been published, but including the ms of her best-known
book, _The Clairvoyant Journal_.

You can view this new digital archive of Weiner's manuscripts at --
http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/m504/5/index.html

This digital initiative is a model of how libraries can make their
one-of-a-kind mss holdings available, a true library without walls. I know
Hannah, if she were alive, would be pleased to be on the cutting edge one
more time.

For those interested in Weiner, be sure to visit her EPC author page:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/weiner
which also includes a link to the UCSD digital mss. In the meantime, I am
planning to complete the e-book publication of the Angel Hair edition of
_The Clairvoyant Journal_ by late Spring (about one-third of the book is
already on-line at the EPC, along with soud files of here performances of
the work).

BREAKING NEWS  |  DECEMBER 16, 2004
TREASURY DEPARTMENT LIFTS PUBLISHING RESTRICTIONS

Dear PEN members and Core Freedoms supporters,

 Yesterday morning, the Treasury Department issued amendments to the Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) regulations that restrict publications from countries under U.S. trade embargo (currently Iran, Cuba, Sudan, and North Korea). As you know, PEN is a party to a lawsuit challenging these restrictions, and on a preliminary review, the changes look very promising.

A brief press release follows this message as well as the article in this morning's New York Times. Feel free to copy and distribute this to anyone you know who is interested in this case.

Under the amended regulations, publishers have been issued a general license to publish information and informational materials originating in those countries, and to do what publishers normally do when they publish: pay advances and royalties, collaborate with authors, market their publications, etc. A general license means that publishers don't have to seek OFAC's permission case by case.

There are some elements of the amended regulations that we need to clarify, and our lawyers will be drawing up a list of questions for the Department of Justice's lawyers to make sure we understand all the details; we of course, want to confirm that all publishing and information exchanges can proceed without restriction or exception. So technically, we are still in litigation and will remain so until our lawyers and the DOJ agree that the suit is settled. There are, as I say, a number of issues to be resolved before that can  happen.

We will probably have additional information by next week and will, of course, send along more details as soon as we have them.

For now, many thanks for your support,

Larry Siems

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

 TREASURY DEPARTMENT RESPONDS TO LAWSUIT BY
CHANGING ITS REGULATIONS TO PERMIT THE PUBLICATION OF
BOOKS AND JOURNALS FROM AUTHORS IN SANCTIONED COUNTRIES

 New York, NY (December 15, 2004)--In September 2004, publishing trade groups and authors’ organizations filed suit in federal court to strike down regulations of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that effectively bar U.S. publishers from publishing books and journal articles originating in countries such as Iran, Cuba and Sudan that are subject to U.S. trade embargoes.  Their effort was joined by Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian author and human rights activist,  in late October.  In response to the suit, OFAC issued new regulations today which explicitly permit Americans to engage in “all transactions necessary and ordinarily incident to the publishing and marketing of manuscripts, books, journals, and newspapers in paper or electronic format.”  This includes substantive editing and marketing of written materials, collaborations between authors, and the payment of advances and royalties.

 The revised regulations are “clearly a step in the right direction, permitting the broad range of publishing activities American publishers and authors must be free to pursue,” according to Edward J. Davis and Linda Steinman of Davis Wright Tremaine, counsel to the Association of American University Presses (AAUP), the Association of American Publishers Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division (AAUP/PSP), PEN American Center (PEN), and Arcade Publishing, the plaintiffs in the case.  “We will continue to examine the regulations in detail, but it is plain that significant obstacles have been removed for American publishers and authors who want to work with authors in Cuba, Iran and Sudan.  Works of critical importance to the advancement of science and our understanding of international affairs can now be published without threat of civil and criminal sanctions.”  The new regulations can be located at http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/js2152.htm

Government Eases Rules on Writers in Sanctioned Nations

By EDWARD WYATT

[]he Treasury Department, under fire for regulations that restricted the publication of works from countries under American economic sanctions, issued broad new rules yesterday that will allow United States publishers to work with authors from those countries as long as they are not government representatives.

The new rules follow the filing of lawsuits recently against the department by publishers and an Iranian winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. The suits argued that the Treasury regulations violated the First Amendment and overstepped the laws intended to restrict economic trade with countries under sanctions.

The countries affected by the regulations currently include Cuba, Iran and Sudan.

Stuart Levey, under secretary for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Treasury Department, said in a statement that the old regulations were "interpreted by some as discouraging the publication of dissident speech from within these oppressive regimes."

"That is the opposite of what we want," Mr. Levey said. "This new policy will ensure those dissident voices and others will be heard without undermining our sanctions policy."

Under the new rules, which are effective immediately, the range of permitted activities include "all transactions necessary and ordinarily incident to the publishing and marketing of manuscripts, books, journals and newspapers" in paper or electronic format, including the commissioning of new works, advance payments, augmenting of already published work with photographs or artwork, editing and publicity.

The rules prohibit publishers from working with government representatives from countries under sanctions, although publishers can work with academic and research institutions and their employees in those countries.

But some activities remain restricted, including the development, production and marketing of software, general marketing activities unrelated to a written publication and the operation of a publishing house or sales outlet in the designated countries.

Lawyers representing the individuals and organizations that sued the Treasury Department said they were pleased with the new rules.

"This looks very good for the publishing industry," said Edward J. Davis, a lawyer who in September filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the Association of American University Presses, the professional and scholarly division of the Association of American Publishers, the PEN American Center and Arcade Publishing Inc.

"I think it's going to give a good deal of comfort to everyone involved with the publication of books, journals, newspapers and online material," Mr. Davis said.

Philip A. Lacovara, who filed suit on behalf of Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights advocate and recipient of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, and the Strothman Agency, a literary agency that sought to commission her memoir, said the new rules "seem to unblock the kind of publication we had sought the right to pursue."

But both he and Mr. Davis said it was unclear as yet whether all of the concerns in their lawsuits had been fully addressed and that it was too early to say whether the lawsuits would be withdrawn.

Mr. Davis noted that the regulations allow publishing activities do so by granting a "general license" for them. The publishing companies contend in their lawsuits that the First Amendment and recent laws make publishing exempt from regulation, thereby requiring no license.

Molly Millerwise, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, said the new regulations were not issued in response to the lawsuits. Rather, she said, the new rules are "more of a clarification" that the department had been considering "since we were first asked how the regulations apply to publishing activities."

In late 2003 and early this year, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued several advisory letters saying that publishers could face legal consequences for almost any editing of manuscripts from the affected countries. Essentially, only camera-ready copies of publications could be published in the United States.

But in April, the Treasury Department revised its ruling, saying that normal style and copy editing procedures were allowed, as was peer review of articles for scholarly publications.

August,

My answer was meant to be funny, too.  Foucault, indeed, is an "authority," which is a patronizing way to discuss his argument.    The word "inane" is harsh, but also direct.    The question is moot--which doesn't mean it has been settled, but that the discussion so much spinning of the wheels.   And I agree with Alison, but only so far:  there is something anti-feminist about its very use.  Don't just put it under erasure--get rid of it.

If you want substance, I suggest looking at people who study the phenomenon (one of whom is Foucault; another is Paul Bove in Intellectuals and Power, and Jonathan Arac, Critical Genealogies).  I wouldn't look for substantial discussion of the issue online, since the very medium itself is opposed to the concept.  (Men of letters need academies to be recognized as such.  If there is online, no one has told me.)  I was quite serious about what I said when I argued that William Gibson had the idea better than Foucault:  we are not specific, but technical, mostly, these days.

I bristle almost as much at the term "professional."  A professional has been professionalized -- "disciplined" to use another of Foucault's terms.  I associate the term with a certain affect and certain kind of distancing, though I also associate it with irony.   I see by your specifications of what you mean that you are suggesting that a person who exercises tact and judgment when being engaged by people who want to talk to them, and that is not something unreasonable to expect.  The reverse of this behavior has been called "mandarin" and sometimes the behaviors of people warrants such abuse.    But again I don't think that writers have any special requirement or capacity to do this.   What you seem to describe has something more to do with teaching and being of concern for others.  I have had the fortunate experience to meet accomplished folks who are generous with their time and knowledge, but not everybody is cut out for that role.  Thankfully the are more ways to get to
  the
 House of Mirth than ones that are prescribed by society or those we ourselves would to like prescribe.

as for civilization, I recall Mark Twain saying something about that.

Shelldance Nursery owners' home destroyed
By Elaine Larsen
A lifetime of original and collected artwook, rare books, poetry and
manuscripts literally went up in smoke when fire broke out late Friday
afternoon at the home of Nancy Davis and Michael Rothenberg - longtime
owners and operators of Shelldance Nursery at the base of Sweeney Ridge in
Vallemar.
The sight of the giant plume of thick black smoke rising high above the
highway on the landmark hill startled many commuters who immediately
realized it was coming from the couple's home, nestled in the trees below
the brightly colored, more visible greenhouses.
Firefighters and Police began getting emergency calls about the giant
structure fire at about 4:05 p.m. The phones at the Police Department were
literally ringing off the hook with callers trying to report the blaze.
























Although six fire trucks from Pacifica, Daly City and San Bruno raced to the
scene as fast as they could, thick after-school traffic clogged the highway
and slowed them down. Police completely stopped northbound traffic so
emergency vehicles could cross over before the divider to reach the
Shelldance driveway, normally only accessible from the northbound lanes.
Other fire trucks came in from the south, with firefighters laying on the
horn to move aside the path of backed-up cars.
Once on the scene, firefighters faced the problem of getting their hoses up
the steep, twisting driveway. While there are some low-pressure water pipes
at the upper greenhouses, there is no hydrant on the grounds.
"One of the problems we had was that the closest fire hydrant is in front of
the police station. We emptied two complete fire truck hose beds, laying out
1,800 total feet of hose from the hydrant to the house," said Pacifica Fire
Marshal Steve Brandvold. "The remoteness of the house and the time it took
to lay that amount of hose made this a tough fire to battle. And the timing
was unbelievable. It couldn't have been worse. By the time we got on scene,
the house was fully involved."
By the time the 29 firefighters could assemble their hoses and gear, the
fire had already done major damage to the house. It took more than 20
minutes before they could get the fire contained and extinguished.
The flames were largely confined to one of the bedrooms, burning off the
roof and down through the floor. However, thick, black, intensely hot smoke
poured through the enclosed house, charring everything in its path and
leaving grimy black residue on the walls, surfaces and windows. Whole
shelves full of books were burned black on the outside, their pages
crumbling with a touch.
The couple's son, Cosmos, 13, and two high school-age buddies had just come
home from school and discovered the fire. Both the youngsters and Cosmos'
two 12-week-old German Shepherd littermate puppies, Blaze and Layla, were
outside when firefighters arrived.
"We pretty much lost everything," said Nancy Davis, stunned by the enormous
loss. The family is staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Rockaway Beach
while sorting out insurance paperwork and conferring with the National Park
Service, which owns the entire property and buildings and leases to the
couple. A close friend has lent them an RV to park on the grounds to give
them a retreat during the day.
"The Park Service extends its sympathy to Nancy and Michael," said Christine
Powell, spokesperson for the Golden Gate National Recreation Service. "Our
staff is extending our sympathy and support. We want to extend any
assistance we can."
An internal Park Service investigation is underway this week, and Powell
said more information was needed "to determine how best to move forward." A
comprehensive General Management Plan for the GGNRA has already begun, and
it will eventually include a long-term determination for the future of
Shelldance Nursery. "We will look at the future of Shelldance," said Powell.
"But right now, we are concerned for the welfare of Nancy and her family and
how best we can care for them."
"Right now, I'm just trying to get my feet stable," said Davis. "I've had a
devastation, but I have a lot of love around me. People have been so
courteous and thoughtful and that has been the most wonderful thing. It's
really helped keep me together."
Davis and Michael Rothenberg have lived in Pacifica for more than 25 years,
taking over the 1940s greenhouses and cultivating it into Shelldance
Nursery. In their early years, they focused on bromeliads and created what
was once the largest private collection in the United States. in 1995, about
a third of the collection - some 30,000 plants - were purchased by the
government of Singapore to form the core of The Royal Botanic Gardens of
Singapore.
Since then, Shelldance has shifted solely to orchids, although it has been
greatly expanded as both an art gallery and rainforest exhibit that draws
visitors every weekend. Davis frequently hosts school tours and
environmental outreach programs. The National Park Service's Mori Ridge
Trailhead leading up to Sweeney Ridge is at the base of the hill next to the
greenhouses which draw people up the Shelldance driveway by car, foot and
bicycle.
Locally, Rothenberg and Davis are known not only for their work at
Shelldance, but also for their environmental activism as core members of
Pacificans For Mori Point, the grassroots group that pushed for the
protection of Mori Point, the coastal hill directly across from Shelldance.
"They were very key players in Mori Point eventually becoming acquired by
the GGNRA," said former Mayor and close friend, Peter Loeb. "What started
the revolution in this community was a plan for 280 condos on Mori Point.
That lead to a referendum, election of a new majority of the City Council
and the grassroots, Pacificans For Mori Point. Michael and Nancy have
certainly been a focal point for the work to expand GGNRA's boundaries to
include Mori Point. And that nursery is a magical place that draws a lot of
visitors."
Likewise, the couple's home reflected their artistic and environmental
sensibilities. The walls of the spacious living room were literally "a
canvas" for their collective artwork - Davis' paintings and Rothenberg's
poetry and other writings. Cosmos lost his treasured bass guitar, video
games and a prized collection of Buddhas, crosses and other religious
artifacts from his travels, including a memento from a trip to Ireland's St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
"I lost early drafts, manuscripts, whole collections of books," said
Rothenberg, who was away at a poetry reading event in New York when he heard
the devastating news. "The whole house was like a canvas - of my words and
Nancy's pictures. This whole thing is surreal, like being in a dream. Losing
your sense of home and place in the world is a real trauma on a primal
subconscious level. I find myself stopping strangers on the street and
telling them 'my house burned down. Can you believe it?' The only thing
that's keeping us going is the response of our friends. I'm grateful to
everyone for being so supportive."
"This just isn't fair. It's a severe blow and they don't deserve it," said
John Curtis, a longtime friend of the couple who works at the nursery on
weekends. "Nancy and Michael have contributed so much to Pacifica over the
years. I hope the community rallies behind them. They will need all the
support they can get to rebuild and maintain Shelldance as the vital and
human face of the National Park to Pacificans and visitors.
"Nancy has created a warm and welcoming environment of rainforest plants and
orchids. She gives tours to elementary classes, senior groups and orchid
clubs. She even built a stage in the events center to host weddings,
birthday parties and special events. Nancy also created an art gallery to
feature local artists that has been a big success. We get visitors from
every state and from countries around the world."
In fact, what happens next is uncertain since the property - including the
house - is owned by the National Park Service. The property's ownership was
transferred many years ago from Caltrans, which had once intended it for an
expansion of Highway 380, to the National Park Service, a complicated
process that took the intervention of state politicians. Rothenberg and
Davis were able to negotiate a lease agreement with the Park Service that
has been in effect since.
"There is a lot of concern that the Park Service do right by these tenants
and not jeopardize their ability to stay in business, both at Shelldance
Nursery and in their stewardship role as well," said good friend, Ann
Edminster. "Everyone feels the same - we need them to stay there. That land
is a real asset to the Park Service and the fact it has not been vandalized
or dumped on unlike Milagra Ridge is because Nancy is there 24/7 as a
caretakers," she said.
"These aren't just your average citizens losing their average home. They
been stewards of a public resource for a long time and have done a
phenomenal job. There's a mutual benefit relationship between the Park
Service, Shelldance and the community."
Edminster said she and others have already begun talking about ways people
can help. Fire Marshal Brandvold estimates a $400,000 loss of building and
another $100,000 property loss.
"We've had a lot of emails from people willing to lend their help and
skills. But even if their insurance covers the contents of the house, how do
you put a dollar amount of rare book, manuscripts, works of art and
collections of a lifetime. All the living creatures are safe, thank God. But
losing a home is like a sudden and unexpected death. Fortunately, people are
very compassionate. That's the good part."
As for Nancy, Michael and Cosmos, Davis said they're all just trying to keep
it simple for now.
"The first thing that ran through my mind is 'Is my son OK?'" she said. "The
most important thing is we all survived. All this outpouring of support is
giving me inspiration and energy. I look down at my hands and think, I'm
still here. I can do another painting. Like the Phoenix, there is life after
the ashes."
Shelldance Nursery continues to remain open for visitors and customers every
weekend. Ann Edminster has offered to match helpers with needs as the family
identifies them. Email Edminster at avedminster@earthlink.net for more
information. Please do not call.

In this process of compounding, two things added together do not make a thi=

Could we liken this to differance? Or is perhaps differance in the interest=

thanks for this, vernon. it's shocking to read about, but it's also a
very beautiful article that does justice, a bit at least, to the
spirit of activism that permeates the lives of those involved, and
decribes the beauty of the place and how loved it and its inhabitants
are.  very inspiring.

I have to read the intro essay, but these Weiner pages are a wonderful

In fact the work made me down write/right homesick for my old Olivetti

Of course Fenollosa did not have a complete understanding of Chinese
ideographs, and his work has long since been refuted by scholars. But his
theories remain fascinating and useful, which brings into play the
importance misreading has to poetry. We see some of Langpo here.

I'm interested in these kinds of questions. I read a lot of Nietzsche
over the last several months, and I'm still trying to figure out where
he situates Buddhism. He makes about 15 references to Buddhism in The
Birth of Tragedy and The Geneology of Morals alone.

Anyway, I discovered this article last fall around the time I wrote the
poem below (not intended as a conflation of eastern thought and
deconstruction mind you). If you can get past the frame it's since been
pulled into, the article is an interesting read.

Subject: Fenollosa and Differance

In contemplating compounding in Chinese ideograms, Fenollosa makes this
statement:

In this process of compounding, two things added together do not make a
third thing but suggest some fundamental relation between them.

Could we liken this to differance? Or is perhaps differance in the
interest of opposites and their de(con)struction?

Here are some sites regarding the link between these two philosophies. I
personally reject nihilistic buddhism. Manifestation of being and language
indicate, to me at least, that we are evolving towards something, not nothing.
Words still aren't making it: they're more like intoxication and  foreplay even
when they express the deepest of sorrows.

I can see Hannah's work (Stephen-Paul Martin's work is another fine =
example)as an attempt to break through the confines of the page as I am =
doing with my visual-literary work.

As Harry Polkinhorn writes about my work:

"Highland found himself more and more constrained by the format of the =
book page. He felt a need to work with the visual dimension of written =
language or texts, leading to the large scale of the works on display in =
the gallery space. These works demand to be viewed rather than read, =
however, even though they take their formal inspiration from letter =
shapes, words, phrases, and the linear conventions of print and =
manuscript culture. Still, these beautiful and intriguing works engage =
the viewer as a participant by virtue of our habit of deciphering =
letters as symbols, conferring meanings upon them even if the meanings =
must remain tentative.."=20

The complete essay is here:
http://www.august-highland.com/essay.html

Some of my visual work is here:
http://www.august-highland.com/

I have had eight shows in California over the past 6 months and have =
appeared in over a dozen online and print journals.

I will be having more shows here and internationally and am interested =
in collaborating with writers.

I will use their text to integrate into my visual-literary works. My =
work has been called Alphanumeric Painting. I like to call it =
Genre-Splicing because I am bridging literature and the visual arts.

I have always been a bridger.

This is what I set out to accomplish with the MAG, and what my new =
editor-in-chief will continue to do. He is fluent in 6 languages and =
will continue to bridge nations through poetry and fiction. My new =
poetry editor is from Iran and she too is multilingual.

This is my attempt to be a man-of-letters.

So if anyone like Jeff Harrison or Richard Tylr and other fine writers =
on this list (I can't accept the work of Sondheim however because of his =
recent emails to my address with virus' attached; and I will also not =
accept work by other unethical or just plain nasty people regardless of =
the merit of their work, because I DO judge a man-of-letters/writer not =
on the basis of their work alone!

Backchannel if you want to work together. That includes you =
women-of-letters too :)

Best,
August Highland

  I want to thank UCSD's Archive for New Poetry, which is part of the
  Mandeville Special Collections Library, and especially Matthew Peters,
  Lynda Claassen, and Rob Melton, who have provided an extraordinary =
on-line
  archive of Hannah Weiner's writing. Patrick Durgen has been the =
overall
  editor of the project, and it is another example of his superb and =
much
  appreciated work on Weiner's papers. Be sure to read his introductory =
essay.

  UCSD has now made available about 500 pages of Weiner's ms, mostly =
writing
  that has not yet been published, but including the ms of her =
best-known
  book, _The Clairvoyant Journal_.

  You can view this new digital archive of Weiner's manuscripts at --
  http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/m504/5/index.html

  This digital initiative is a model of how libraries can make their
  one-of-a-kind mss holdings available, a true library without walls. I =
know
  Hannah, if she were alive, would be pleased to be on the cutting edge =
one
  more time.

  For those interested in Weiner, be sure to visit her EPC author page:
  http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/weiner
  which also includes a link to the UCSD digital mss. In the meantime, I =
am
  planning to complete the e-book publication of the Angel Hair edition =
of
  _The Clairvoyant Journal_ by late Spring (about one-third of the book =
is
  already on-line at the EPC, along with soud files of here performances =
of
  the work).

Mary et al =20

I couldnt get this directly to you so it has (or might have) some =
relevance to the group so here is my response  -a bit delayed - your =
email address rejected my email...
Mary

Thanks - immensely - its great just to know someone is noticing - I had =
my
tongue partly in my cheek (often start my emails seriously then I wobble =
off
into satire of fantasy - you  might have  seen my bogus "quotes"  - I =
was
hoping for some one to say - "he didn't say that!! or "she didn't "or "I
didn't!!" but no one saw or took the bait !!  (or cared) (eg I had Louis
Zukofsky saying: "Politics is what makes us human" (letter to Ezra Pound
1962) as I know Silliman etc worship LZ  (I haven't read enough of him =
to
make much of a judgement )  - there is no such quote - I wrote it in a
poem! -  actually and I have a lot of other bogus stuff mixed into my
letter -emails !!  Just my humour.  "Misquote as Method" by Richard =
Taylor -
hehe!!

"Man of letters is strange " but then August does some strange - and
interesting stuff - I don't know anything about cabals etc  ( I know =
that
Michel Rothenberg would be the person for that - he just recently =
suffered
the fire - tragedy -

Language is inadequate but in fact that is apart of the mystery of
existence -and the power of poetry lies in echoing that ambiguity of
language and the impossibility of ever knowing any absolute truth or
truths - personally I am more concerned about he state of my bank =
statement
than whether language is reflecting truth - I think that in life human
beings frequently fail to develop good communication skills and even if =
we
ever attain an egalitarian world so to speak we have - or would have - =
real
difficulties dealing with communication etc - life is not and will never =
be
easy and those communication problems  - echoed in poetry etc - will =
always
be there (they go beyond spoken language) - there will be no "progress" =
per
se - but standards of living etc - rightly will gradually improve
(possibly)....but the human heart will remain aware of death and loss =
etc
and other, joyful things.

"So to
> continue using the words as art, the poet breaks them down into =
components
until
> we're looking at electrons and quanta, not the interaction and =
connection
of
> wholeness."

This could be the beginning of a poem! But I agree - it can tend that =
way -
this happens maybe more with poets such as Grenier and others of "In The
American Tree" (eg 'Polaroid' by Coolidge is interesting).

As communicators and translators we should be striving for more
> cognisance, not veering away from it.

The "should " I would leave out - if you mean translators of foreign
languages etc and communicators in everyday life could agree I think, =
but as
poets are we such? - not sure...

 Art is not restrictive, but whether or not
> we're actually trying to communicate something or creating art for =
art's
sake
> is  the secret of the artist.

Yes - I often have no idea what my own poems are about I or why I wrote =
them
yet I often feel that I have communicated something - especially when I =
get
a good response at readings (I don't read much (to audiences I mean!)) =
these
days).  (When I started back into poetry at about the age of 40 (lol!) I =
was
looking for poetry of recent poets and found "Houseboat Days" by John
Ashbery - and I took it home and this woman and I (platonic we were
platonic) laughed over it but I was impressed that Ashbery had won the
Pulitzer and from that day I was hooked and thought it was secret that =
very
few others in New Zealand had - but gradually all the writing on Ashbery =
was
revealed - but I still like his work: he is an example of a writer =
working
in a mode I like - he swerves away from and back toward meaning =
constantly -
he pulses between the possible and the completely unknowable - =
personally I
find it is the intense moment of  the apprehension of a perceived =
"meaning"
that is like a discovery as a child discovers a flower or  water for the
first time that is the totality of poetry - no overall meaning per se =
-no
dialogue or 'story' the 'story' is the beautiful mystery of being =
itself.

And yes - we constantly need to abstract - and also to attempt to
"objectify -but I am losing myself a bit here!!

I know those people who zoom in on to language  - they become or can =
become
obsessed with numbers or words as mysterious symbols (which they are I

This is wonderfully put! I agree - it is a dilemma - but we soldier on - =
we
live - a NZ Poet (Kendrick Smithyman) wrote - "If we live we stand in
language" which is enigmatic and maybe out of context... but echoed his
interest in Heidegger (I know not  liked by everyone but an interesting
character - I have only read bits and pieces of his (Hdgr's) writing) =
...

(Also Bernstein talks of this in an essay in "In The American tree " =
which
is an essay that influenced me but more anon - he mentions Riding in =
there)

(By the way I haven't really read anything much by Jackson Maclow - lol =
- he
as probably a great poet  )

All that said I haven't written much for a while myself - but must get =
onto
it. Thanks for your email - I know it was to the poetics list but I have
used up my quota for now !!  Hasta la vista!  keep in touch either on =
the
List or ex.

I have only experienced a garage fire - the fire brigade were close my
place - just down the road but the garage was destroyed - such is the speed
and ferocity of fire - - and the fire threatened to leap to my mother's
house - the effect even of that was rather traumatic because I had a lot of
stuff -  which I had brought over (form a house in another suburb) when my
marriage collapsed -  in my garage (then my mother's)  - it included a
piano - a whole lot of cables and technical stuff I had ( a very good
digital meter
and a good soldering iron etc and power supply I had built ) but it also
had - and some survived - photographs of my children etc and one photograph
I took in the- about 1969 - 73 in B&W :

mostly of people in the protest movement days or after and or my children
and some photographs of myself - now I had taken hundreds of shots of my
children's birthday parties and so on and my children but hardly any of the
handsome young man I was (well perhaps not particularly handsome but at
least I wasn't fat and bald etc) - ok I was no Film Star but I was more or
les acceptable - no baldness  - long black hair - lean - not fat as now -
and so on -  almost a romantic figure - not tall of course - never was man
for women to get too excited about (if at all)  but what I was I couldn't
really remember very much - but it is things like that - and this is a
point - as one gets older you suddently realise -I can never never be seen
as I was! - in a sense the old me is dead! why didn't I take thousands of
photographs of myself - ?? - and inside my house I now have hundreds of
unpublished poems etc - mostly crap of course - but one hangs onto one's
stuff - even books I would find hard to gather together again - and also
there is a (or I imagine there would be  a terrible sense of desolation -
where is everything? - or  for some people -who have never
had much -  perhaps very poor people - to whom the loss of a house often
means nothing - or much less than people such as myself who live very much
inside books etc - and also I don't like being out there "in the great
outdoors " ( I like to check into motels and if I cant afford that -which I
cant these days - I stay home)  - I could - never have been "tough" or
really roughed it for long - always had money somewhere no matter how hard
things have got - never experienced real poverty -

but we - and I include myself -put a great store by things - and there is
nothing by wrong with that - that is what we are we are poets or artists etc
and things do matter (as long as they don't matter more than people or our
own lives):

 but I don't have smoke alarms here in this old house because it has
occurred to me I do value all the junk I have around me as I live alone with
a non -poetic cat and all and I feel I don't have anything much more than
this place and this location and trees, objects, miscellania, things on the
wall etc and if it all burns I would rather die in the place - (stupid
reasoning I know) -

or perhaps the buzz of my life was getting some recognition by some that I
had some talent  (not in forming human relationships which surely are
greatly more important than things and objects - yet we are creatures
that love such things, such objects (I think this links back to how humanity
evolved - we are tool makers, and by accumulating and sorting etc - by being
collectors collators and and makers at one remove - we thus advanced - we
also had doers and accumulators or various compendia fo the two kinds and
/or those in between - recall Columbus had a very large library)).........so

But where is Michael in all l of this you might be "screaming"  - "you are
raving about yourself!" - well that is how we relate to these things we
remember something that happened to ourselves "like it"   - but these
traumatic events are always UNIQUE for each indiviudal  - that said this is
my way of empathising, my response...

..so as I a was saying....there is all my crap and some treasures and things
that are a part of me or
seem to be, poems in various states (many in book at the bottom of drawers),
mostly "crap" probably but... . also my
poems  (or some of them) are thought by some to be good - in any case I
hoard things and I like the idea I wrote them  - it probably doesn't matter
what happens to them when I am dead - into the fire with the lot!! (after
all we are all headed for the final crunch - no?)  ....and there are my
children's pictures and letters they sent to me when I was young - we are
mixed up with where we live (somewhat we are where we live) - I know that
and feel very much for Michael I know he is a very deep man with great
interesting  in modern/postmodernist poetry and indigenous literatures
(something I have neglected  here in NZ ) and I know some of his work and
have the two books he co-authored with Pierre Joris

The burning down of a house can (or could be) as shocking as a death.

Hello,

I have some stamps, envelopes, grease pencils, and paperback books
with their bindings cut off.  Do you?  If so, that'd be great, if not,
I have enough of each to cover for us both.  Would you be interested
in a slow moving (snail mail) collaborative project involving the
creation of poems by the process of removing and altering text from
these pages?  All terms of the scope of the project are negotiable on
an individual basis, of course, but in my mind I'm thinking it would
be simplest to move sequentially through a whole book.  But I'd be
open to having a handful of random pages exchanged, too.  I can do the
even numbered sides of pages, and you can do the odd, or, vice versa.

If you're interested, please back channel me at dwaber@logolalia.com
and let me know what shape you'd want this idea to take in order to
keep being fun for you.

Whee!
Dan

Progress/Under Erasure re-presents in a new edition, with a new preface,=20

 1985,=20
Progress was greeted with enthusiasm and public debate. Its linguistically=

was pitched against the media saturation and political banality of the=20

On its original publication of Progress in 1985, Ron Silliman wrote:=20
=93Deeply pessimistic about the concept of progress itself, the poem is, in=
=20
many ways, a direct descendant of Allen Ginsberg's classic of the =9160s,=20
=91Wichita Vortex Sutra.=92 Although Progress is a much longer work, the=
 range=20
of the two poems, their density and overall sensibility are remarkably=20

RE: Michael Rothenberg

Last Friday, Michael had a catastrophic fire at his home in Pacifica.
Fortunately, no one was home and Nancy and Cosmos were not injured.
A lifetime of books, archives, artwork, and personal possessions were mostly
destroyed.

Michael has Terri Carrion with him who is helping regroup. They are meeting
with insurance parties and lawyers and sorting out what can be done and
making decisions about the next steps.

Hal Bohner, the legal council for Poets In Need is also on hand. A lot of
people have asked how they might help Michael and where to send things:
money, books etc.  At the moment, there is a fund being set up to help
Michael and his family and as soon as there is information to give out, I'll
send another e-mail to this group. Please feel free to forward this e-mail,
or to give out my e-mail address to those who want information as it becomes
available. Some friends have asked about sending money to Poets In Need. As
Michael is on the board of this non-profit organization, it creates a
conflict of interest and although the board members will help Michael out
individually (I'm one of them), it can't actually be done through grant
money.

At the moment, Michael does not have his computer with him as he was on his
way to NYC for a couple of days when this happened and left it in Florida,
so save the e-mails until he's back on line. He has asked me to be a liaison
between his poet friends and himself at the moment since as you can imagine,
he is quite overwhelmed. I speak to him pretty much everyday and will be
happy to pass on messages. Michael is really touched at the response from
his friends and the poetry community.

I'll be keeping in touch. Again, I apologize if you've gotten all this
before, but the next e-mail will be genuine news.

Best regards to all and thank you for your concern about Michael.

Suzi Winson

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Dear August and All,

I have been following this thread with great interest--something I do from
time to time here, which, in the parlance of cyberspace, makes me
a "lurker."  Your questions have been turned over in so many compelling
ways, but I hope that you will not begrudge a latecoming lurker some
additional remarks.

The funniest response is poor Jughead (it's Jughead, right? I don't know
the old comics that well, but Shirow is something else) with his head over
here and his body over there.  So arch!  So macabre!  Perhaps it would
have been even funnier with a caption: "To lose one's head, no longer to
know where one's head is, such is perhaps the effect of dissemination."

Alison Croggon's is undeniably the most damning, the most devastating, of
the replies to your question, August, and the one I've been pondering
most.  Still am.

I wonder if the beginnings of a reply might be found in Robert Corbett's
posts, which show an ear for irony and also echo the very just feminist
suspicion of "universal" subject-positions.  Corbett's reply is my
favorite, and reminded me that what Gibson meant by "technical" is not far
removed from the subject of irony:

"I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of
tennis socks, not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for: If
they think you're crude, go technical; if they think you're technical, go
crude.  I'm a very technical boy.  So I decided to get as crude as
possible.  These days, though, you have to be pretty technical before you
can even aspire to crudeness."

[Digression: Of course the film was very bad. I blame Longo more than
Gibson.  Jones is all wrong.  I've never met Gibson. Has anyone met
Gibson? Is he worth meeting?  Is he keeping himself alive so that all of
his fans can meet him one day?]

I think I know what Robert (if I may) is saying about the resistance of a
medium to reflection on that medium.  But I don't know that we're speaking
entirely the same language, because I don't know that our collective
technical condition makes inter- or even trans-disciplinary work
impossible.  I would certainly like to hear more on these points.

Finally, August, I wonder if I wouldn't ask another question altogether:
what is posthuman literacy?

I know that no one seriously concludes a missive these days with a
militant call to undermine the bourgeoisie, so I'll just say

yrs in gravedigging,

Kevin

I'm trying to track down a poem/book by James Magorian.

A friend copied these lines down in the early 1970s and says he's been
"haunted" by them ever since:
"So many eternities/away from where/quick plovers scamper/across the prayers
of mud."

We'd like to determine which of Magorian's poems they come from, and what
book the poem is in. (Ultimately we'd like to locate a copy of the book.)

I have 6 of Magorian's books here but have come up empty ~

If it rings a bell, we'd be very grateful for any info!

many, many thanks!

cheers ~

Being the knucklehead that doesn't look at what he has before he buys
something that I am, I just bought an extra copy of Michael Palmer's
_Blake's Newton_, & am, thus, offering it up for sale to whomever wants it.

It's a tight copy with a little cover fading. $25 gets it to you via
Priority Mail in the US.

Thanks!

Saraha, a practioner of Mahamudra, and one of the 84 Mahasiddhas of Buddhism,
comments on language as obscurant to practice (from his Treasury of Song):

The whole world is tormented by words
And there is no one who does without words
But in so far as one is free from words
Does one really understand words.

I used to recite [the text] "Let there be success."

There is but one word that I know now,
And of that, my friend, I know not the name.

Ah yes...Words are arbitrary...and yet there are certain sounds, said a
certain way, the invoke power.

In Buddhism, just as with other "metaphysical" philosophies, words
become...The 8-Fold Path discusses this.

I had this feeling that I was
worth loving, and you let me

have it: a month of solid
silence and invisibility, and you've

forgotten me now, I'm sure:
haven't even taken the movies back.
I feel I might've excited you. True,
you said, "You're mischievous,
undermining, it gets you hot
to be bad," with the heroin
of your eyes pushing through me,

"I need all your attention."
Client status: Connected.
In cramped shoes I'm
transparent on milk
ice: sliding over islands, mortar,
crystals lateral with morphine
lapsed into strings,
stillness; my lace.
Cerebral, but rebellious.

The secret to rolling a great joint
is to roll it tight enough to smoke well
but loose enough to let any left-
over stems elude piercing the paper.

I feel it might be exciting
to feel loved. Someone rubs me

until I blossum. Until it

rains on my tongue. This is free.
There are only so many

kinds of sense. One in which
you're thick, surrendered
to golds and reds, wear glasses
and have supper with your
mother. Meanwhile, outside
our encampment, fat
velvet fires rescue air from
almost total transparency.
I suck up files from a remote
location for work. Wake up
with my eyes already sunk,

jerk off: get high. Client status:
Connected. A tartly-intelligent
girl with her hand on my belly.
She says she likes it too much.
She has all my attention.
Character sets legitimize
where the pre-dawn wind
plies from you in heavy draughts
your childhood, your child, rubber
nipples: reading under a passive
milk of electric, not walls.
They hug cattle before they
shoot them in the brain.

I sleep past waking.

Everyone will be infinitely home soon.

I was dreaming in blush sundaes,
before, though: we are the wasps
that would rather sting themselves
to death, if that means we escape
a natural terminal port: we're
those literal motherfuckers
who will not hover, but sparkler
and cackle like it's all that's
holding us down. I hate the royal
we. Dreaming about licking
the heart of red, the pith of gold,
cleaning you of stalwart
impurities. Ever feel

like you're just marking a beat
in a line. Smoke orally
inflates the room. Filtration
flirts with purity the way eightball
chicks glom to money;

it makes them feel loved. Even
common houseplants know
where the sun is, swoon and go
limp when she's gone. I'm still

waiting for that Saturday you promised me
not thinking about me at all not thinking about
you at all not thinking about you at all.

If there is no privileged meaning to the text for any specific reader, that
must needs include the writer of the text as well. The sociological or
cultural  set of the reader and the writer appears to be the prime cause of this, and
that  set must include natural disasters and phenomenon. Changes in
sociological and  or geo-cultural sets change meaning for the reader and writer. This
is nothing  new. Yeats calls it poetry. He is wrong in his mysticism too,
though at least he  recognized the nature of language in a clearer primitive view.
This algorithm is  not properly proposed. If the text in the position it is
presented, has no  privileged meaning for any specific reader including the
writer of the text, it  is the text that is real or not merely proposed, and the
organism that is either  the reader or the writer that is proposed or not
entirely real. The complete  vested unfolding reality of the organism must be the
text. The first meaning of  the organism is the text, and any remaining meaning
of the organism after death  is the text. The text is the only proof of the
proposed reality of the organism  that reads and or writes it. It follows most
sensibly that the text is to prove  the reality of the organism though it
seems to arise from the  organism.

It follows as well that the cause of the organism's existence is the text.
Though the text is in a form mediated by the intrusion of the proposed
organism,  the organism itself must be the hypothesis of a pre-existing, unmediated by
the  proposed organism, form of the text. The hypothesis must be - that the
organism  can exist for provision of, and because of the mediated form of the
text that  will exist because of the intrusion of the proposed organism. The
hypothesis of  the mediated form of the text that we commonly call language is -
that the  organism can exist as long as the text can uphold the meaning of
the  organism.

It follows as well that the pre-existing or unmediated form of the text
could only exist because of a proposed differentiation. It certainly must be  that
the organism is a group proposition of the unmediated form of the text
caused by the proposition of differentiation within a group proposed awareness -
yet to be defined dynamic. A single primordial awareness cannot have proposed
text in any form. The purpose of the proposed existence of the organism must
be  to prove the proposition of the text.

The organism (human being) is independent of the text in interactions of
physical similarity. These physical activities are a matter of selection by a
text oriented intellect independent of text control because of the proposed
physical similarity of the organism by the unmediated form of the text for the
purpose of validation of the proposition of differentiation. Free will gives us
 war and lovemaking and proof of differentiation and potential communication.
It  follows sensibly that the freely acted physical endeavors of the organism

That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I find this text of yerS interesting, however, I'd that the desire-machines are a facto that wreaks havoc at the edgesof what appears to be a textuality without context. That is indeed the criticism made of deconstruction and its infinite text.   But I find what you ahve written very beautiful anyhow, that its rhythm speaks to me as much if not more than what it says. that the litany like forward movement of the ideas that it unfolds allows a grace of song in spite of its hypothetical nature. I.e all of this business of privelige , well it does not really apply to the average unpriviliged writer, or poet. The notion of a privilige in writing always strikes me as something reserverd for a certain class ie. the class of theoreticians and their perpetrators  the professors.  THat being said, these creatures also have their place in the great declamatory chain of signifiers that constitutes the becomings of the immanent flow of language and its real place in bodies and history. O
 ne
 thinks of Milton and his endless production machine of prose on the one hand and poetry on the other. One has always has the sense that the 'If' that often starts a text of this sort predicates the writer's view point on a nothing that exists...

thank you

as Joyce says

Ave Laval my leaves have drifted from

and yes there is an authority in the texts

Subject: Text & Continuous Existence

If there is no privileged meaning to the text for any specific reader, that
must needs include the writer of the text as well. The sociological or
cultural set of the reader and the writer appears to be the prime cause of this, and
that set must include natural disasters and phenomenon. Changes in
sociological and or geo-cultural sets change meaning for the reader and writer. This
is nothing new. Yeats calls it poetry. He is wrong in his mysticism too,
though at least he recognized the nature of language in a clearer primitive view.
This algorithm is not properly proposed. If the text in the position it is
presented, has no privileged meaning for any specific reader including the
writer of the text, it is the text that is real or not merely proposed, and the
organism that is either the reader or the writer that is proposed or not
entirely real. The complete vested unfolding reality of the organism must be the
text. The first meaning of the organism is the text, and any remaining meaning
of the organism after death is the text. The text is the only proof of the
proposed reality of the organism that reads and or writes it. It follows most
sensibly that the text is to prove the reality of the organism though it
seems to arise from the organism.

It follows as well that the cause of the organism's existence is the text.
Though the text is in a form mediated by the intrusion of the proposed
organism, the organism itself must be the hypothesis of a pre-existing, unmediated by
the proposed organism, form of the text. The hypothesis must be - that the
organism can exist for provision of, and because of the mediated form of the
text that will exist because of the intrusion of the proposed organism. The
hypothesis of the mediated form of the text that we commonly call language is -
that the organism can exist as long as the text can uphold the meaning of
the organism.

It follows as well that the pre-existing or unmediated form of the text
could only exist because of a proposed differentiation. It certainly must be that
the organism is a group proposition of the unmediated form of the text
caused by the proposition of differentiation within a group proposed awareness -
yet to be defined dynamic. A single primordial awareness cannot have proposed
text in any form. The purpose of the proposed existence of the organism must
be to prove the proposition of the text.

The organism (human being) is independent of the text in interactions of
physical similarity. These physical activities are a matter of selection by a
text oriented intellect independent of text control because of the proposed
physical similarity of the organism by the unmediated form of the text for the
purpose of validation of the proposition of differentiation. Free will gives us
war and lovemaking and proof of differentiation and potential communication.
It follows sensibly that the freely acted physical endeavors of the organism
with the text oriented intellect must/need produce over time a universal
text of differentiation for any form of awareness and a continuous existence for
the organism as the mediator of the text.

TIME'S MAN OF THE YEAR AWARD, 2004

Take that prisoner to the center of the page,
try him, tie him, and photograph him.
Something must burn the Narcissus. Is it this
strange swimming thing he's doing with his hands,

kind of odd, dangling above the pool
of his own blood? Kierkegaard could use this as an illustration
of Hegel, and "history," as this photograph
I'm holding will show to prove: I read the news.

The passionate will continue to argue, or
agree. They will continue to mispronounce "Moonache."
The looping reel will dutifully throw the rape
back on the walls: from memory, the whole fucking thing.

the streets of unfaithful beauty
like the forest
are meetings of  universes
where people intrude
their own pristine space
in green  sprout ignorance
a stagnant lacking of new manifestation
and brackish  polluted promises
amnesia
we each make our own
breathe separately in  sync
our own air
auto exhaust & pine forests
holding our breath  greedily
hoping to maintain borders
asphyxiate ourselves
so wherever  we

planning for the next holiday
a wilderness picnic
a  block party
a sigh of relief

"Clifford's style of activism was a shade different.  Almost everything I
said sparked him to argue with it on philosophical and pragmatic grounds.
Guilt-tripping was a useless strategy, he said.  Mornings are no time for
demonstrations, when everyone has to get to work and nobody can stick
around to hang out.  Weekly rides are too frequent to draw real crowds.
Raising consciousness among observers and the media doesn't matter, he
said.  What matters is having fun and changing reality for those within
the rides.  And then he started talking about work reduction.  As my
eyes glazed over, I suggested he go to Canada.  They hate it!  The pigs
just hate it!  And I suppose we could probably do without tail-docking if
we gave them more room, because they don't get so crazy and mean when they
have more space.  With enough room, they're actually quite nice animals.
But we can't afford it.  These buildings cost a lot.  Arnie's ideas were
eye-opening.  I had never encountered this particularly California type of
activism.  I had always seen demonstrations as means to an end, not ends
in themselves.  I had always placed utopia in the future, following the
struggle.  Jonkil seemed to be hinting that the struggle itself can be the
utopia.  These slogans moistened to life within me as I imagined hundreds
of cyclists riding together, reclaiming the pavement for life.  What could
anyone do about it?  Maybe it was possible to create the alternative world
now, without waiting for some imaginary revolution.  `How will you know
when the revolution has happened?' my girlfriend at the time liked to
ask."

"As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents,
more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some
great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their
heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by
a downright moron."  -- H.L. Mencken (1880-1956)

"Alan," Azure said, "We can take the lower road."

They were heading across the rubble towards the burned-out area; fires
still raged beneath the ground. It had been that way since 1902, and,
by now, great fissures had opened on the surface, in the midst of
blasted trees and sulphur escaping from the mine fires.

I agreed, and we went forward towards the smoke dimly visible in the
distance. The disturbance was clear, was clearer.

(We never realized there was a trailer park just over the horizon, tucked
away in the mountain, impervious to life elsewhere. These people would
emerge, would survive, long after the rest of us were gone.)

I laughed to myself and thought that it was very amusing. Well, I think took my 'orginal' reply and re-wrote it, or doctored it up , adding and taking away, snipping, snapping , cutting and having fun and stuck it in my blog and fictionalized it.

I was having a look at these Alan.  I hadn't looked at your concepts closely
for some time. I started to when I got a copy of a CD Rom you sent...but got
diverted form it...Hadn't realised (for example) that you were injecting
real people (or their texts etc) into your cyber project.

I had the thought - what would Alan do if the net crashed completely? But I
suppose that's like asking what if the sun exploded tommorrow...

The abacus thing is interesting - your whole whole concept is fascinating -
but it is so vast - the equivalent of 15,000 pages !!  If we think about how
other poets use 'cyber space' (excluding people seriously "into" vispo etc
etc )   - say we look at some one posting poems (although more and more
people posting 'innocent' poems are also involved with some sort of visual
artwork) but most use it just as we use a piece of paper etc - but your
"idea" (if I can talk of one idea) seems to be that you and realiity itself
are being created thru the net thru cyberspace etc (of course something
written on an email is no less "real " than something spoken - just it's a
different experience) - is this to some extent the idea behind Matrix the
film? (I saw part one of that when I didnt have computer))

Potentially the permutations of psychic or intellectual interaction on the
net are near infinite - we go to a site and there is  poem or a discussion
with link taking us to another concept (person idea whatever )  -  a
realisation of the 'infinite chase' perhaps)..certainly on on basic count  -
the interraction between your waves (long and short) and within your
aves  - the long and short and waves and the voices brings in mind the essay
by Bernstein on creating a hyperreality (his essay in "In the American
Tree".... a polyvocal multi modal space - the many voices -of your Nikuko
/Susan etal  (I realise now they are real (or if they arent real - what is
reality etc!!) - so unlike eg Berryman's "voices" they are from "other"
consciouneses - which interests me because before I got computer I wanted to
move this way somehow  (with my "Infinite Poem") - of course why not put a
map of reality right over everything? Put everything in...

Darkness pervades but some of the more conventionally "poetic" things
yousend or are in your project are quite beautiful - or by their use of
linguistic "overkill"  are emotonally evocative or disturbing: especially if
one is aware that just perviously there has been a text that finishes with
rows of zeroes and begins with a discussion on mathematical or arithmetical
operations  on an infinite abacus (not the usual thing we associate with
"pure" poetry!!)  but the interactions are there -

The limitations of it (your project) for me and probably others are or is
the sheer vastness of it and that in my case I have bifocals thus I have to
read a computer screen with my head on an angle  (sounds ridiculous if not
risible but - as one gets older one becomes so - one trips and the young are
ready to laugh - fall and the young dogs tear the old dog's guts out (the
laughter  gives the young permission to annihilate the old (tommorrow I will
think all humanity are potentially sublime! it is not always so!! this
miasma shall lift!!)) - nature does that to us: prepares us for death by
slowly increasing the many malfunctions of the organism seen and unseen))
[rubbish Richard! Rubbish!]- this (reading a computer screen) becomes very
tiring - thus I need a book - ultimately (?) - fascinating as net and vipso
is  - I need a book - but of course if I had a DVD player I could use that
and I do have your (orone of your) CD Rom(s) - so maybe that/those
objections is/are not fair......and the hugeness of it fascinates:

I was moved to spend time looking at your links and so far cant come up with
much that is very "deep" -

I think most people will be baffled by what you are doing - that said that
isn't an objection - people will get more or less from it as they study  it
(that is a  atruism and applies to all creative works - but we need to keep
saying or reaffirming this point - even if one is talkng to oneself - or do
we?).......

And if all this was "pure play" of signifiers etc etc without bodies and
blood and cries - and the various interacting or conflating waves [ a
perfect square wave would consist of an infiinite number of sinusoidal
harmonics - a "fact' to drop into the converstion at the next party you go
to!!] [that in trun reminds me of tehpoem by Frost heen the Professor stays
in a hotel with travlelling salesman who mockes him by saying he is one  of
those "square the circle men' !!)- the voices intruding against the numbers
and signs and computer imperatives - and those components of the waves in
which there are such things as "It is terrible to be alive" or  ::  "All my
children" ..then a series of symbols down the page or screen - "falling
down"  - (was that in fact a ref to Macbeth?: "All my pretty ones - in one
fell swoop?" etc  and is it also something very personal - your children
there  -or your child is your work? (The signs 'falling' are the children of
your creation or- beneath that -? )

The total effect of this symphony is dark - you are a Sibelius not a Gilbert
and Sullivan or ragtime or Hayden!!! - I had some Bartok on my tape -which
was between some Beethoven etc and my daughter said such music (Bartok's)
reminded her of Horror moves - the music they do ( I mean the music group
she is in "The Nudie Suits") is - basically "jolly!! - and is good - (I dont
think I like Bartok either actually - of "serious" composers my favourite is
Charles Ives and the NZr  Psakis) - I think now of Aaron Und Moses by
Schoenberg - and Nudel  - Nudel's threne is dark - he is calling for
Hebron - but how different is his project !! And Celan - (Pierre Joris
writes on him and has just done a book, as you will know ...) (makes me
recall that Sontag says that the Holocaust (via a discussion of Hitler and
Speer and the filmaker..forget her name) is THE subject of the 20th
Century - will it go on gnawing at the 21st?) Looking at a lot of the things
I have written I also note my most creative period was when I was in very
dark 'space' - so  this isn't a criticism - these are only notes arising.

I cant thus complain of "too much" darkness - one is often irritated by what
one sees is a 'fault' in oneself.... Notes arising, notes arising...

Richard Taylor

And beow these lines of links do indeed seem to "thrum" and the links to
your text _become_ your text/project and so the whole project
circulates -spins on itself -no?

The subject line says it all.

For the past year we've been doing most of our 'business' through the catal=
ogue, word of mouth, at readings and on the street (for free, regarding the=
 zines).

I'm looking for any contacts that would take our pamphlets, zines, and othe=
r projects for sale through their own devices or stores or where ever. Simp=
ly, we're looking for wider distribution.

Can someone also tell me about this 'big paper engine' if that's what it'st=
ill called?=20

Thanks much, please back channel me for [d]e-tails

May I ask who is Clifford?

Not the anthropologist, nearly America's own Gregory Bateson--except there can be but one Gregory Bateson (thank god sd. Margaret Mead).  rmc

kmarzahl <kmarzahl@INDIANA.EDU> wrote:
"Clifford's style of activism was a shade different. Almost everything I
said sparked him to argue with it on philosophical and pragmatic grounds.
Guilt-tripping was a useless strategy, he said. Mornings are no time for
demonstrations, when everyone has to get to work and nobody can stick
around to hang out. Weekly rides are too frequent to draw real crowds.
Raising consciousness among observers and the media doesn't matter, he
said. What matters is having fun and changing reality for those within
the rides. And then he started talking about work reduction. As my
eyes glazed over, I suggested he go to Canada. They hate it! The pigs
just hate it! And I suppose we could probably do without tail-docking if
we gave them more room, because they don't get so crazy and mean when they
have more space. With enough room, they're actually quite nice animals.
But we can't afford it. These buildings cost a lot. Arnie's ideas were
eye-opening. I had never encountered this particularly California type of
activism. I had always seen demonstrations as means to an end, not ends
in themselves. I had always placed utopia in the future, following the
struggle. Jonkil seemed to be hinting that the struggle itself can be the
utopia. These slogans moistened to life within me as I imagined hundreds
of cyclists riding together, reclaiming the pavement for life. What could
anyone do about it? Maybe it was possible to create the alternative world
now, without waiting for some imaginary revolution. `How will you know
when the revolution has happened?' my girlfriend at the time liked to
ask."

Yes and thanks Richard. Celan and Bartok both mean a great deal to me
asyou can imagine - as does Jabes, other people like Kathy Acker, Alphonso
Lingis - not so many pots as 'writers' in general - I'd put Derrida in
there was well; he has also published an enormous amount of material.

My work has been parcelled over eleven years at this point, not all at
once; and there are concrete manifestations - performances, video, sound
pieces etc. - it's not all online. But the text does have a cohesiveness
itself I think, and I'm Bjorn has placed it within kunst.no.

You say - I was moved to spend time looking at your links and so far cant
come up with much that is very "deep" - Can you elaborate? Are you talking
about the text as a whole?

Re: Characters - Azure and Foofwa are real; none of the others are,
including 'Alan.'

And yes to your characterization of thrumming...

Lyrically, Iskra are one of the most out-spokenly political and

This is to announce that the homepage of filmmaker and poet Abigail Child is
now live.  Please set your links to help it move up the charts:

http://www.abigailchild.com/

Abigail Child is a film and video maker whose work in montage and
sound/image relations pushes the envelope of film/video with humor and
ephemeral beauty. Her recent work explores mixed genres and strategies for
rewriting narrative, as well as exploring public space through memory and
history.

Child began filmmaking in 1970 as a documentarian, producing seven
independent 16mm documentaries between 1970 and 1976, among them the award
winning Game (1972) and Between Times (1975). In the mid 70s, Child began to
produce experimental work, culminating in her series Is This What You Were
Born For?, which included the films Prefaces (1981), Mutiny (1983), Both
(1988), Perils (1986), Covert Action (1984), Mayhem (1987), and Mercy
(1989).

In the 90s she turned to an investigation of public spaces, with B/side
(1996) and Below The New: A Russian Chronicle (1999) which was shot in St.
Petersburg Russia. Her newest films include Surface Noise (2000), DARK DARK
(2001) and WHERE THE GIRLS ARE (2002), all premiering at respective New York
Film Festivals while the single channel version of CAKE AND STEAK (2004) was
featured at Oberhausen Film Festival this spring. Her works range in length
from 5 to 70 minutes.

Child is, as well, the author of a number of critical articles and several
books of poetry (A Motive for Mayhem, Mob, Scatter Matrix, Artificial Memory
most recently) with a new critical book forthcoming from University of
Alabama Press: THIS IS CALLED MOVING: A Critical Poetics of Film. Both
poetry and critical texts have appeared in a number of anthologies,
including Moving Borders (Talisman Press, 1997), From the Other Side of the
Century (Sun and Moon Press, 1994), and Resurgent: An Anthology of Women's
Writing (Southern Illinois Press, 1992).

Child's films and videos have won many awards and have been shown in
retrospectives in conjunction with the New Museum at Anthology Film Archives
(New York), Torino Film Festival (Italy), ICA (London), Mercer Union Gallery
(Toronto), The Collective For Living Cinema (New York), The San Francisco
Cinematheque and Frameline Film Festival (California). The work has
officially been selected for the Oberhausen Film Festival, Visions du Reel,
Nyon, the London and Rotterdam International Film Festivals, Pesaro Film
Festival (Italy), the New York Film Festival and Video Sidebar, the Latin
American International Short Film Festival (Toronto), and World Wide Video
Festival (Den Haag)-among many others.

Child is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship (Russia), an NEA
Fellowship, a Guggenheim Foundation Grant, a Massachusetts Arts Council
Grant, an AFI Independent Filmmakers Grant, multiple grants from the New
York State Council on the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, the
Jerome Foundation, and the MacDowell Colony (residential studio).

Child studied History & Literature at Radcliffe College (Magna cum laude)
and graduated with an MFA from Yale University School of the Arts (Honors).
She has taught film/video production and history at various schools,
including NYU, Massachusetts College of Art, The Art Institute of San
Francisco, Sarah Lawrence and Hampshire College. Since Jan. 2000, she is
Chair of Film /Animation at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

_______________________


"The Delusional Is No Longer Marginal,"
Bill Moyers, upon receiving the Harvard School of Medicine's Global
Environmental Citizen Award, December 10, 2004

I accept this award on behalf of all the people behind the camera whom=20=

you never see. And for all those scientists, advocates, activists, and=20=

just plain citizens whose stories we have covered in reporting on how=20
environmental change affects our daily lives. We journalists are simply=20=

beachcombers on the shores of other people's knowledge, other people's=20=

experience, and other people's wisdom. We tell their stories. The=20
journalist who truly deserves this award is my friend, Bill McKibben.=20
He enjoys the most conspicuous place in my own pantheon of journalistic=20=

heroes for his pioneer work in writing about the environment. His=20
bestseller The End of Nature carried on where Rachel Carson's Silent=20
Spring left off.

Writing in Mother Jones recently, Bill described how the problems we=20
journalists routinely cover-conventional, manageable programs like=20
budget shortfalls and pollution--may be about to convert to chaotic,=20
unpredictable, unmanageable situations. The most unmanageable of all,=20
he writes, could be the accelerating deterioration of the environment,=20=

creating perils with huge momentum like the greenhouse effect that is=20
causing the melt of the Arctic to release so much fresh water into the=20=

North Atlantic that even the Pentagon is growing alarmed that a=20
weakening Gulf Stream could yield abrupt and overwhelming changes--the=20=

kind of changes that could radically alter civilizations.

  That's one challenge we journalists face=97how to tell such a story=20
without coming across as Cassandras, without turning off the people we=20=

most want to understand what's happening, who must act on what they=20
read and hear. As difficult as it is, however, for journalists to=20
fashion a readable narrative for complex issues without depressing our=20=

readers and viewers, there is an even harder challenge--to pierce the=20
ideology that governs official policy today. One of the biggest changes=20=

in politics in my lifetime is that the delusional is no longer=20
marginal. It has come in from the fringe, to sit in the seat of power=20
in the oval office and in Congress. For the first time in our history,=20=

ideology and theology hold a monopoly of power in Washington. Theology=20=

asserts propositions that cannot be proven true; ideologues hold=20
stoutly to a world view despite being contradicted by what is generally=20=

accepted as reality. When ideology and theology couple, their offspring=20=

are not always bad but they are always blind. And there is the danger:=20=

voters and politicians alike, oblivious to the facts.

  Remember James Watt, President Reagan's first secretary of the=20
interior? My favorite online environmental journal, the ever-engaging=20
Grist, reminded us recently of how James Watt told the U.S. Congress=20
that protecting natural resources was unimportant in light of the=20
imminent return of Jesus Christ. In public testimony he said, "after=20
the last tree is felled, Christ will come back."

Beltway elites snickered. The press corps didn't know what he was=20
talking about. But James Watt was serious. So were his compatriots out=20=

across the country. They are the people who believe the Bible is=20
literally true--1/3 of the American electorate, if a recent Gallup poll=20=

is accurate. In this past election, several million good and decent=20
citizens went to the polls believing in the rapture index. That's=20
right-the rapture index. Google it and you will find that the=20
best-selling books in America today are the 12 volumes of the "Left=20
Behind" series written by the Christian fundamentalist and religious=20
right warrior, Timothy LaHaye. These true believers subscribe to a=20
fantastical theology concocted in the 19th century by a couple of=20
immigrant preachers who took disparate passages from the Bible and wove=20=

them into a narrative that has captivated the imagination of millions=20
of Americans.

Its outline is rather simple, if bizarre (the British writer George=20
Monbiot recently did a brilliant dissection of it and I am indebted to=20=

him for adding to my own understanding): Once Israel has occupied the=20
rest of its 'biblical lands,' legions of the anti-Christ will attack=20
it, triggering a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon. As the=20
Jews who have not been converted are burned, the messiah will return=20
for the rapture. True believers will be lifted out of their clothes and=20=

transported to heaven, where, seated next to the right hand of God,=20
they will watch their political and religious opponents suffer plagues=20=

of boils, sores, locusts, and frogs during the several years of=20
tribulation that follow.

I'm not making this up. Like Monbiot, I've read the literature. I've=20
reported on these people, following some of them from Texas to the West=20=

Bank. They are sincere, serious, and polite as they tell you they feel=20=

called to help bring the rapture on as fulfillment of biblical=20
prophecy. That's why they have declared solidarity with Israel and the=20=

Jewish settlements and backed up their support with money and=20
volunteers. It's why the invasion of Iraq for them was a warm-up act,=20
predicted in the Book of Revelations where four angels 'which are bound=20=

in the great river Euphrates will be released to slay the third part of=20=

man.' A war with Islam in the Middle East is not something to be feared=20=

but welcomed--an essential conflagration on the road to redemption. The=20=

last time I Googled it, the rapture index stood at 144--just one point=20=

below the critical threshold when the whole thing will blow, the son of=20=

God will return, the righteous will enter heaven, and sinners will be=20
condemned to eternal hellfire.

So what does this mean for public policy and the environment? Go to=20
Grist to read a remarkable work of reporting by the journalist Glenn=20
Scherer. Read it and you will see how millions of Christian=20
fundamentalists may believe that environmental destruction is not only=20=

to be disregarded but actually welcomed--even hastened--as a sign of=20
the coming apocalypse. As Grist makes clear, we're not talking about a=20=

handful of fringe lawmakers who hold or are beholden to these beliefs.=20=

Nearly half the U.S. Congress before the recent election=97231=20
legislators in total, more since the election=97are backed by the=20
religious right. Forty-five senators and 186 members of the 108th=20
congress earned 80 to 100 percent approval ratings from the three most=20=

influential Christian right advocacy groups. They include Senate=20
Majority Leader Bill Frist, Assistant Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,=20=

Conference Chair Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Policy Chair Jon Kyl of=20=

Arizona, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, and Majority Whip Roy Blunt.

The only Democrat to score 100 percent with the Christian coalition was=20=

Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia, who recently quoted from the biblical book=20=

of Amos on the Senate floor: "the days will come, sayeth the Lord God,=20=

that I will send a famine in the land." He seemed to be relishing the=20
thought.

And why not? There's a constituency for it. A 2002 TIME/CNN poll found=20=

that 59 percent of Americans believe that the prophecies found in the=20
book of Revelations are going to come true. Nearly one-quarter think=20
the Bible predicted the 9/11 attacks. Drive across the country with=20
your radio tuned to the more than 1,600 Christian radio stations or in=20=

the motel turn some of the 250 Christian TV stations and you can hear=20
some of this end-time gospel. And you will come to understand why=20
people under the spell of such potent prophecies cannot be expected, as=20=

Grist puts it, "to worry about the environment. Why care about the=20
earth when the droughts, floods, famine and pestilence brought by=20
ecological collapse are signs of the apocalypse foretold in the Bible?=20=

Why care about global climate change when you and yours will be rescued=20=

in the rapture? And why care about converting from oil to solar when=20
the same God who performed the miracle of the loaves and fishes can=20
whip up a few billion barrels of light crude with a word?"

Because these people believe that until Christ does return, the Lord=20
will provide. One of their texts is a high school history book,=20
America's providential history. You'll find there these words: "the=20
secular or socialist has a limited resource mentality and views the=20
world as a pie...that needs to be cut up so everyone can get a piece.'=20=

however, "[t]he Christian knows that the potential in God is unlimited=20=

and that there is no shortage of resources in god's earth......while=20
many secularists view the world as overpopulated, Christians know that=20=

god has made the earth sufficiently large with plenty of resources to=20
accommodate all of the people." No wonder Karl Rove goes around the=20
White House whistling that militant hymn, "Onward Christian Soldiers."=20=

He turned out millions of the foot soldiers on November 2, including=20
many who have made the apocalypse a powerful driving force in modern=20
American politics.

I can see in the looks on your faces just how hard it is for the=20
journalist to report a story like this with any credibility. So let me=20=

put it on a personal level. I myself don't know how to be in this world=20=

without expecting a confident future and getting up every morning to do=20=

what I can to bring it about. So I have always been an optimist. Now,=20
however, I think of my friend on Wall Street whom I once asked: "What=20
do you think of the market?" "I'm optimistic," he answered. "Then why=20
do you look so worried?" And he answered: "Because I am not sure my=20
optimism is justified."

I'm not, either. Once upon a time I agreed with the Eric Chivian and=20
the Center for Health and the Global Environment that people will=20
protect the natural environment when they realize its importance to=20
their health and to the health and lives of their children. Now I am=20
not so sure. It's not that I don't want to believe that--it's just that=20=

I read the news and connect the dots:

I read that the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection=20
Agency has declared the election a mandate for President Bush on the=20
environment. This for an administration that wants to rewrite the Clean=20=

Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act protecting=20=

rare plant and animal species and their habitats, as well as the=20
National Environmental Policy Act that requires the government to judge=20=

beforehand if actions might damage natural resources. This for an=20
administration:

  * That wants to relax pollution limits for ozone; eliminate vehicle=20
tailpipe inspections; and ease pollution standards for cars, sports=20
utility vehicles and diesel-powered big trucks and heavy equipment.

  * That wants a new international audit law to allow corporations to=20
keep certain information about environmental problems secret from the=20
public.

  * That wants to drop all its new-source review suits against polluting=20=

coal-fired power plans and weaken consent decrees reached earlier with=20=

coal companies.

  * That wants to open the artic wildlife refuge to drilling and=20
increase drilling in Padre Island National Seashore, the longest=20
stretch of undeveloped barrier island in the world and the last great=20
coastal wild land in America.

I read the news just this week and learned how the Environmental=20
Protection Agency had planned to spend nine million dollars--$2 million=20=

of it from the administration's friends at the American Chemistry=20
Council-to pay poor families to continue to use pesticides in their=20
homes. These pesticides have been linked to neurological damage in=20
children, but instead of ordering an end to their use, the government=20
and the industry were going to offer the families $970 each, as well as=20=

a camcorder and children's clothing, to serve as guinea pigs for the=20
study.

I read all this in the news.

I read the news just last night and learned that the administration's=20
friends at the international policy network, which is supported by=20
Exxon Mobil and others of like mind, have issued a new report that=20
climate change is 'a myth,' sea levels are not rising, scientists who=20
believe catastrophe is possible are 'an embarrassment.'

I not only read the news but the fine print of the recent=20
appropriations bill passed by Congress, with the obscure (and obscene)=20=

riders attached to it: a clause removing all endangered species=20
protections from pesticides; language prohibiting judicial review for a=20=

forest in Oregon; a waiver of environmental review for grazing permits=20=

on public lands; a rider pressed by developers to weaken protection for=20=

crucial habitats in California.

I read all this and looked up at the pictures on my desk, next to the=20
computer-pictures of my grandchildren: Henry, age 12; of Thomas, age=20
10; of Nancy, 7; Jassie, 3; Sara Jane, nine months. I see the future=20
looking back at me from those photographs and I say, "Father, forgive=20
us, for we know now what we do." And then I am stopped short by the=20
thought: "That's not right. We do know what we are doing. We are=20
stealing their future. Betraying their trust. Despoiling their world."

And I ask myself: Why? Is it because we don't care? Because we are=20
greedy? Because we have lost our capacity for outrage, our ability to=20
sustain indignation at injustice?

What has happened to our moral imagination? On the heath, Lear asks=20
Gloucester: "'How do you see the world?" And Gloucester, who is blind,=20=

answers: "I see it feelingly." I see it feelingly.

  The news is not good these days. I can tell you, though, that as a=20
journalist I know the news is never the end of the story. The news can=20=

be the truth that sets us free-not only to feel but to fight for the=20
future we want. And the will to fight is the antidote to despair, the=20
cure for cynicism, and the answer to those faces looking back at me=20
from those photographs on my desk. What we need to match the science of=20=

human health is what the ancient Israelites called 'hocma' --the=20
science of the heart.....the capacity to see....to feel....and then to=20=

act...as if the future depended on you. Believe me, it does.

Hi, I'm wondering if anyone reads my work at this point, or, as Richard
says, does it just appear as an incomprensible mass? Of course some of you
do read it, maybe once every few days, maybe once a month, but most of you
at this point might have me in spam/delete/kill or otherwise files - and
then, just as absent students in a class - there's no reply, since this
message won't reach you; if something's wrong, I won't hear about it, if
even this message is too much or not enough, it will have vanished in
/dev/null or other 'recycle/trash' bin forever... Of course there might be
rumors; this or that Poetics subscriber might have had a tidbit from some-
where, a murmur or a whisper that I'm still around, but there's no way to
know it.

I feel guilty as charged, hating spam, junk mail, am on phone-lists for
phone-spam removal, official lists, lists sanctioned by the government,
fines imposed for unsolicited calls, and then doing it myself; even though
there are no sales involved, there is still time which for some equals
money as well.

Ah well..

Hi Alan,

Is it a real question or part of a text? With you, I don't quite know. If it
is a real question I do read your work. i cannot say i read all of it
because there are days when I just delete everything that gets into my
mailbox, excluding personal mail that requires a reply. I even have an Alan
Sondheim folder in my home email program, right after the Sasha folder (my
daughter). I keep there some of the stuff that I guess I want to keep.

Hi Alan,

Yes, I read these, I didn't read the entire one of G_d but I don't have your
messages in some kill file and I do read them in their entirety more than now
and again, once every few days? but that periodic reading is true of messages
from others too. So anyway I wouldn't take silence from me anyway as an
indication to 'shut up', and happy holidays!

Best,

Thanks to the people who replied, of course those who didn't may not have
received this.

Someone asked if the query was a piece - it's not, it's an honest
question.

Victoria SWAG Selling Sixty $10.00 Memberships

    Victoria Status Women Action Group Needs Your Immediate Support.They
    need sixty people to buy one ten dollar membership to help them pay
    for their rent. They Do have a web address. All you have to do is
    type in Status Women Action Group Victoria

A Short Story Written by Debbie Beach

Leaving behind nights of terror & fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise...
I rise
I rise
I rise."
Now Will Victoria Status Women's Action Contiune To Do The Same???

There is something about Christmas that makes our hearts skip a beat and
hold still for a second.
There is magic at this time of year all things just for one moment in
time are possible. The door is open and all we need to do is step in and
find our answer to eternal love, hope, and peace.

I hope that our community can spare some of their love for Victoria's
own Status Women Action Group has been in existance for over thirty-four
years. We have been able to produce research data on Garenteed Livable
Income, offer numourous support to all women who have come through our
doors and have support various community organizations.

We created a program called the Good Food Box that is still in existance
and is providing nutrious and affordable food to multiple low income
families. Pracitum students from bothe University and Community Colleges
have helped us out in the past and used our material is key note
research for their studies.

The volunteer staff are very worried about whether they will be able to
stay open after Dec.31/04 due to the lack of funding.
As the core group is getting on in age, and many of them are losing
their jobs they are turning to V-SWAG for support but are not able to
finicial pay for services. We do have a website
What we as volunteers are asking for is the communities support so that
we can continue doing our job. To pay for our rent and telephone bill
all we need is sixty people to buy a memebership at ten dollars per card.

All We need is $600.00 to pay for January's Rent!

    "It was at this point that several witnesses report seeing what
    appeared to be excessive physical violence done to Anthany by police
    officer(s): "When I saw him being punched it made me feel sick." It
    is alleged an officer said, "When I tell you to roll over, you
    fuckin roll over." Witnesses also say police appeared to be joking
    and laughing as they stood behind the ambulance once Anthany had
    been put inside."

Hey Alan:

I read every one and find them varied and valuable
on many levels... and I agree with Rebecca: my silence
should in no way propell your dummy-up.

Dear Friends,

The BROOKLYN RAIL PRESENTS
An evening reading to celebrate the Winter Solstice --

Please join us at Cheryl Pelavin Fine Arts for a Winter Solstice celebration
with readings from these highly regarded poets and writers. There will be
drinks, snacks, and lots of atmosphere (Tamara Gonzales' show will be up
with a few added touches).

You are encouraged to wear a funny hat!

6 - 8 PM - Tuesday - December 21, 2004

The Egyptian and Persian traditions of celebrating the return of the sun
merged in ancient Rome in a festival to the ancient god of seed-time,
Saturn.

The people gave themselves up to wild joy. The usual order of the year was
suspended:  grudges and quarrels forgotten, wars interrupted or postponed.
Rich and poor were equal, masters served slaves, children headed the family.
Cross-dressing and masquerades, merriment of all kinds prevailed.  A mock
king -- the Lord of Misrule -- was crowned.  Candles and lamps chased away
the spirits of darkness.

Dear Alan,

I read your poetry sometimes.  As you know, I've been reading your
poetry sometimes about 8 years now.  Every year or so I send you a
message saying, "I liked that!"

The reason I'm writing to you now is that I'm replying.  I saw a little
thread and traced it back to you.  I was slightly surprised.

Poetry doesn't solicit response.  In fact, poetry doesn't seem to
welcome the reader or make any real space.  Is the reader a mirror?  Is
the reader the writer's own breath on a snowy morning?

I have been thinking about this question of poetry and audience.

People like to respond, especially to someone they know, especially when
that someone solicits response.  What's up with poetry that it closes
this exchange down?

Mairead

Hi, I'm wondering if anyone reads my work at this point, or, as Richard
says, does it just appear as an incomprensible mass? Of course some of
you
do read it, maybe once every few days, maybe once a month, but most of
you
at this point might have me in spam/delete/kill or otherwise files - and
then, just as absent students in a class - there's no reply, since this
message won't reach you; if something's wrong, I won't hear about it, if
even this message is too much or not enough, it will have vanished in
/dev/null or other 'recycle/trash' bin forever... Of course there might
be
rumors; this or that Poetics subscriber might have had a tidbit from
some-
where, a murmur or a whisper that I'm still around, but there's no way
to
know it.

I feel guilty as charged, hating spam, junk mail, am on phone-lists for
phone-spam removal, official lists, lists sanctioned by the government,
fines imposed for unsolicited calls, and then doing it myself; even
though
there are no sales involved, there is still time which for some equals
money as well.

Ah well..

Well, Alan, since it appears that you can actually put words together
in English to make sense, and even express fellow-feeling with
others, why do you do what you do? What's the theory or purpose
behind posting an incomprehensible mass of unintelligibility day
after day?

here comes  the sun
barely
a few seconds more
than any  other
knowing big fusion
lights up my sky brain
so hemispheric
atmospheric vodka
vitamin d tonic
ozoning  toxic
you are my  sunshine
relatively eternal
my only sunshine
you make me happy
and  burn my retinas
sun spot less mind
photosynthetic greening
my equator  desert
my paramour panting

I  hear you coming

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

To Juan at the Winter Solstice

There is one story and one story only
That will prove worth your  telling,
Whether as learned bard or gifted child;
To it all lines or  lesser gauds belong
That startle with their shining
Such common stories  as they stray into.

Is it of trees you tell, their months and virtues,
Or strange beasts  that beset you,
Of birds that croak at you the Triple will?
Or of the  Zodiac and how slow it turns
Below the Boreal Crown,
Prison of all true  kings that ever reigned?

Water to water, ark again to ark,
From woman back to woman:
So each  new victim treads unfalteringly
The never altered circuit of his fate,
Bringing twelve peers as witness
Both to his starry rise and starry  fall.

Or is it of the Virgin's silver beauty,
All fish below the thighs?
She in her left hand bears a leafy quince;
When, with her right she  crooks a finger smiling,
How may the King hold back?
Royally then he  barters life for love.

Or of the undying snake from chaos hatched,
Whose coils contain the  ocean,
Into whose chops with naked sword he springs,
Then in black  water, tangled by the reeds,
Battles three days and nights,
To be spewed  up beside her scalloped shore?

Much snow is falling, winds roar hollowly,
The owl hoots from the  elder,
Fear in your heart cries to the loving-cup:
Sorrow to sorrow as  the sparks fly upward.
The log groans and confesses
There is one story  and one story only.

Dwell on her graciousness, dwell on her smiling,
Do not forget what  flowers
The great boar trampled down in ivy time.
Her brow was creamy as  the crested wave,
Her sea-blue eyes were wild
But nothing promised that  is not performed.

Robert Graves

Art as Falsehood

Art by its nature is about the significant. To the extent that art is an
expression of the artist's being, it expresses what the artist thinks and
feels to be significant. To the extent that art is an act of communication,
it is a statement to an audience of what the artist thinks and feels to be
important. When an artist decides to devote a week, a month, or a year or
more of her life to creating This rather than That - she is saying that This
is worth his time and effort. When the artist presents the results of his
efforts to an audience, he is telling them that his creation is worthy of
the time and effort of their contemplation. We do not waste our time on the
insignificant or ask others to waste theirs - unless we wish to express the
significant belief that nothing is significant.

Dear Alan,

I'm going to tailgate on Mairead's response to your query
because I very much like what she said and the lovely way she put it.

Although I don't always have time as much time as I would like to to read or
examine all your work as thoroughly as I feel I really ought to, most of the
time when I do I admire it, and frequently it stimulates
me to think or inspires me to take the time for imaginative reverie.

Your impressive ongoing (daily)  commitment to creative productivity-and
publication!- makes me think of a favorite maxim: "Perhaps a great love is
never returned." (Dag Hammarskjold)


Best wishes,
Nick

Charles,

Is the "Ian Tyson" referred to in this obituary really the "country singer
Ian Tyson" as the article claims -- or is it the British artist (including
book artist) Ian Tyson, with whom Jackson collaborated with on a few occasions?

In response to Charles Alexander's question about which Ian Tyson: that's a
funny mistake in the Guardain review.

It's not Ian Tyson, the Canadian folk singer from "Ian and Sylvia" (aka
Mitch of "Mitch & Mickey" in *A Mighty Wind*?), but Ian Tyson the British
book artist (see, e.g.,
http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/arts/IanTyson.asp) who had collaborated
with Jackson.

A non sequitur, unless you are accusing Alan of _posting an incomprehensible
mass of unintelligibility day
after day?_

In which case I'd like to see it demonstrated; and I mean something more
than your finding it incomprehensible and unintelligible - slight redundancy
in your expression there, I feel - because just finding a text
unintelligible may be the result of an individual's cerebral dysfunction

And if you do find it incomprehensible and unintelligible and are as hostile
to it as you clearly are, based on this message of yours, why read it? And
you must be reading it to have answered

Perhaps you are trying to understand. In which case, less hostility might
help Alan to help you

all best

Well, Alan, since it appears that you can actually put words together
in English to make sense, and even express fellow-feeling with
others, why do you do what you do? What's the theory or purpose

Hello all:

Please join us for what promises to be a very exciting event. If you
are in the Bay Area for the holidays, we bring you a Buffalo embrace
of joy! AND, this event marks the release of Drabman's new chap, _the
ground running_, newly sewed and ready for your rabid consumption. If
that weren't enough, Tanya Brolaski will be squarly sandwiched
inbetween, dropping science from her _Daily Usonian_.

From Kelly Holt:

Dear Friends,
It wouldn't be December without a house reading
situated between holidays! Situate yourself in my
house and come see Michael Cross, who'll be in from
Buffalo, and celebrate with him the beautiful ATTICUS
FINCH chapbook series, featuring Tanya Brolaski's THE
DAILY USONIAN and Eli Drabman's THE GROUND RUNNING.

Festivities begin with potluck at 6:30. Reading starts
at 7:30.
Tuesday, December 28

San Francisco
@Irving/ Parnassus
Like BART? take it to Civic Center, then get off and
take the N outbound. It stops at 4th & Irving.
Don't like BART? get off the freeway at either Duboce/
Mission or Civic Center. Duboce: Follow Duboce to
Market, turn left on Market then go up 17th St. when
Market hits Castro (be in right lane). Follow 17th
over the hill to Stanyan, turn left on Parnassus, turn
right on 4th.
The real miracle of Xmas is that parking lightens up
significantly in my neighborhood, as all the med
students are home doing their laundry.

Please forward!
Love, Kelly

didn't save them (meantime my computer crashed) - but clearly you have a

came  "back" into literature late in life and have a lot of catching up to
do (I'm kind of "going backwards " and filling in gaps in my
reading...catching up...)- although sometimes  I think that is just an
excuse not to publish (or to send work out) -
I delete quite a lot of stuff but I intend eg to go back trough the files
you have and the CD - later I might purchase some more books of you - I wish
I could have permission to send some examples and an intro etc to Jack Ross
for the next Brief in NZ  ( local "innovative " magazine)- the DVD he is
probably not so not so interested in just yet -  (Jack may be interested -
but I think will have to get one after Xmas) may get tat after Xmas but I
think for a start more people in NZ should know something of what you re
doing and - as much as possible (where you are "coming from") -there are
problems there of course, as the language used by Derrida (and others) I and
maybe others find very difficult - but Jack Ross is in fact au fait with all
those guys (Barthes, Derrida etc etc - he has a PhD in literature and
translates Old French poetry, French, Spanish and so on and has translated
some of Pound (The "Fascist Cantos") and is the kind of person  (see below
hi interest in Acker  - but his interests includes popular culture - he is
viciously well read and well informed) who would be interested in what you
are doing as but as I mention below he doesn't use the internet as much as
he uses books and other and other media (at least I don't think so ) - but
wee my previous reply to you on this reply as we only have 2 emails a day -
and Brief mag is still getting to a reasonable;y wide audience of informed
and some very bright & innovative writers (actually Charles Bernstein
contributed to it when it was edited by Alan Looney and later I got Chris
Stroffolino to publish there -

The main problem Jack has is funding - cash shortage  -literally it is hard
to fund - it docile fold I then he ahs to subsidise it as certain academics
(who often have a lot of fee money) don't pay very quickly - they seem to
live in worked where money just appears as of a kind of right and they hate
paying for much - have hardly ever been poor  -- but I am generalising - I
mean certain kinds of academics)) and that will  be a bit sad (if it folds)
as it is and has been perhaps the only significantly alternative of
innovative lit. mag in New Zealand - I don't know about Australia  I see you
are there on Amy Ballardini's site - that's good.

If stuff gets deleted or not read or read sporadically that is because we
all have only so much time in the day - that isn't a crit of you - you can
guarantee for every person who deletes all your work there is - well there
is probably about 2 out of ten who are following you project closely (and
even if its one in 100 you are doing brilliantly  I thnk motor what I write
of send have sent out has been either rejected or met with deafening
silence! You are not alone in not getting a response Alan!! Even the
negative responses might show you're having an effect...maybe. But I think
people are out there  thinking about what you are doing  - they are at least
INTERESTED - and of course on here there are  writers such as August, Mary,
Ian Van Huesen and Steve Dalachinsky and Nudel (and  number of others) who
are courageously also doing things and putting them on line (put your self
on the line - feed me  line -  up and be counted )...(there's a poem
somewhere about lines by Burns (the langpo Burns not the Scotsman!) and Jeff
Harrison ( and others who are online and other who are doing Blogs etc) and
some I forget at the moment - I have sent things - sometimes get a
response - mostly a blast of white noise!!) - now that is pretty good to get
any response - I think of things going on that I know of and yours is one of
the most extraordinary projects (I am aware of -obviously there has to be a
lot of other stuff happening - there is so much) -  I know: as to finding it
incomprehensible - I find a lot of work so - maybe not incomprehensible -
maybe to see hard to see large works such as yours in any entirety (or even
in much of an outline at this stage) (after all its a kind of work in
progress? - crappy term I know -)  I think I get a lot of it, it's just find
it hard to say or express how it affects me or what I think you are doing -
but ontologically I think I understand a lot of what you are sending out - I
also find a lot of it strange  - but strange is ok - and so on - hard to get
the time to do so (give it justice) - and sometimes difficult to get a
handle on what is being done - but I think Eliot's point that a great or a
majorly significant work is first engaged before it is comprehended
(totally - if it ever is such) is true in your case (ok Eliot is the arch
enemy of many on here but he was great critics and a great poet - but I
think that Olson and so on would also have appreciated what you are doing -
is there any critical writing on your work Alan by the way?)  also it could
be said that a lot of major work baffles and repels initially  (sometimes
we have to give strong attention to a work or suspend subjective responses
or superficial reactions..) - there is no immediate engagement (necessarily)
but there is an immediate interest - key word - interest - your work
disturbs and sometimes repels or is bothersome etc but it is always
intriguing - or I feel it is... As to relative evaluation etc that is up to
the critics - people much more astute than me (or people who  use lots of
long words and sound astuter than me! And some who use lots of long words an
d ARE astuter!!) and they of course can all be wrong!!

Alan - this may be an insulting question - but are you always a serious
person? Probably not - clearly you are passionately driven in this your
project - but it helps to laugh at things now and then, chill out , not to
stop though! onto to becomes "undark" - but I don't mean (laugh) at yourself
too much  - and I'm not laughing at you.

I think I know somewhat know what you are doing - considering I haven't read
as much of the texts etc as I want to yet -I think I kind of "know" it
ontologically (the term used by Scroggins writing on Zukofsky re difficulty
based on an essay by Steiner which I actually had read some time ago - its
is a way into the question of "difficulty" btw)
  - or I know 'in my bones' or  "get" what your are doing  - I "dig it" - if
obliquely - for now.

[Don't ask me about my struggle with the works of Alan Brunton of New
Zealand!! One of his books - "Moonshine - that I tried to critique or
parse -is like a Universe of references etc and ideas!! It nearly drove me
crazy tat book ---) - but more of him anon ..there is some reference to him
on the NZEPC online]

You may not know of the comedians Dudley Moore and Pert Cook but tin their
very crazy (originally illicit) tapes CDs I remember D M as Derek in "Derek
and Clive" suddenly shouting: " They're all cunts out there!"  (Tongue in
cheek - but many a truth is said in in jest !! If its all getting you down
sometime Alan do some screaming to that effect around your house - as long
as no one is around - it works wonders!!

My belief is growing that you are doing "something extraordinary" even if
just now haven't or can't see it all as I would like to do - for the reasons
above - below I have put my original reply to you. So this is Part One!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------
Of those I have read nothing of Kathy Acker but a friend (Jack Ross ) of NZ
has (he says) been very influenced by her novels - his writing is very
interesting but he isn't interested in cyber writing per se I don't think -
so it would be hard to get you to see his work (unless you buy some of his
books) - but it impressed me one day when he made a strong emphasis  (in a
small group of us who used to meet to discuss poetry etc) that he wanted to
do something very original and he mentioned Kathy Acker (as an influence or
a model) - re Celan I hadn't heard of until a friend apprised me of his work
(around 1994) - I looked at the European poets and Trakl was the poet I
liked the most - but I cant read any languages (well I can if I have
translation can sort of get a feel for it then) so I rely on
translations to read Celan etc- I was fascinated by Pierre Joris's
translation of one of his poems -and his reference to his connection to
Heidegger.

The Bartok was between some Beethoven and Bach and while one of my daughters
likes classical and other the other daughter (Dionne) is not so keen - and
the particular piece is a but dark I must concede...what do you think of
Charles Ives's work and Copeland?  I know Ives's work better and I like his
ideas - in fact the ideas came also via his father who "detuned " pianos
before Cage did.... i like the ideas of Cage bringing sounds into music and
a degree of partcipation by listeners into music/concepts etc I like the way
Ives mixes harmonies until they beocome dsiharmonies  - has references to
Brahms and a popular song etc

Auster talks about "The Book of Changes" by Jabes but I couldn't really get
much from that book.  Some phrases etc - the idea  of it is interesting
though.

Obviously you have read a lot into (and out of) the various philosophers and
critics  - I have read some of them (some of Barthes and so on ) but Derrida
only second hand - that's my reference to the chase of signifiers: I have a
book by him - I opened it - read the first line  - copied the line into a
book I have of phrases, passages etc  - and closed it! Not because I thought
it was nonsense or anything - I just was diverted onto reading other stuff -
I keep doing that - moving from writer to writer - I'll be half way through
a book and a reference comes up so I start reading that writer - the
infinite chase in action! Or the finite chase....

I meant I hadn't had time to assess the work in any overall or integral
way - simply for time reasons - but also I don't know if I had anything
original to say about what you have done - its certainly challenging: but it
requires a young man's energy to write intelligently or critically - Don't
think I have enough knowledge of cyber space or Philosohy or even poetics -
I can only evaluate by my feeling about your work - my more or less
immediate responses - but I think about what you are doing quite a lot...as
I say there is so much of your and other work - this could be one reason you
have not got as much "recognition" maybe as you deserve - also it difficult
to assess - ro think carefully or critically about something "in progress" -
my feeling is that something extraordinary is going on - but I haven't seen
perhaps as much of other works - clearly others are doing projects etc -
yours (in the form it is and of this length) seems to me to be unique - but
I don't know  - ie of these works that also utilise the
internet and the visual - it isn't a criticism - one can't say of what you
are doing - this is just "bad"  - that's not even meaningful - or even to
say "it's brilliant " - that registers enthusiasm but doesn't say much - I
will have to have a good look - I'm also struggling through the poetry of a
rather different writer Kendrick Smithyman of New Zealand - who did no cyber
stuff - but who wrote a huge amount of poetry...

I find it hard to read a lot of poetics and philosophy but I like reading
art critcism and then I kind of "deconstruct it"  (although I was doing that
before I knew what deconstructon meant exactly - not sure if I do now) - as
I
say have only read (most of the philosophers such as Derrida via critics who
mention them) - art has a big influence on what I do...(or has done -don't
write much just now).

I know that your work is not just "in cyberland" and in fact is basically
inclusive of all media - maybe includes all aspects of human consciousness?

More anon - no need to tell you to keep on!

Cheers, Richard.

The Literary World System

by WILLIAM DERESIEWICZ

The World Republic of Letters
by Pascale Casanova; M.B. DeBevoise, trans.

[from the January 3, 2005 issue]

What are you doing? I mean, right now. You're reading a book review. A
review of a book that, as it happens, is almost certain to become
quite famous among intellectuals around the world over the next few
years. And the reason it will become so famous is, in part, because of
reviews like this one. After all, Perry Anderson, writing in the
London Review of Books, has proclaimed that La R=E9publique mondiale des
lettres "is likely to have the same sort of liberating impact...as
Said's Orientalism, with which it stands comparison"--a prophecy that,
because it is by Perry Anderson, and because it is the London Review
of Books, is, to an extent, self-fulfilling. So by reading this
review--becoming one of the people who've heard of the book, who've
begun to form an opinion about it, who might even buy it, read it,
discuss it, cite it--you're not only learning about its impending
fame, you're becoming part of the process by which that fame is
established, a process the book itself calls "legitimation."
(Translation, the act that has turned La R=E9publique mondiale des
lettres into The World Republic of Letters, is another step in that
process.) And this is perfectly apt, because the mechanisms of
legitimation--the global economy of prestige that ushers some authors
into the international literary sphere while keeping others shut
out--is exactly what Pascale Casanova's brilliant, groundbreaking book
is all about.

To understand why it's groundbreaking, it helps to know how the
international literary sphere is usually thought about--or rather, not
thought about. Academic departments, literary academies, histories and
reference works, honors and prizes: The institutions of literary life
almost invariably partition the world of literature into discrete,
autonomous national traditions--English over here, American over
there; Italian in this classroom, Spanish in that; German Romanticism,
French Symbolism, the Russian novel. Even the Nobel Prize, our one
global literary honor, makes a point of emphasizing the national
provenance of its laureates, so that it is understood that it is often
a country as much as an author that is being recognized, and that the
consecration of, say, a Saramago, shuts the door on all other
Portuguese writers for the foreseeable future. As for the books that
enter our national literary space from the outside (especially from
outside the English-speaking world), do we ever think about why some
reach us and not others? Where do translated writers "come from"? Are
they simply the most celebrated authors in their own countries? (In
fact, they often aren't.) If we think about these questions at all, we
probably assume that the writers we become aware of are just better
than the ones we don't. (But "better" according to what criteria,
enforced by whom?) In other words, we've bought into the myth of an
international literary meritocracy, or, in Casanova's words, "the
fable of an enchanted world...where universality reigns through
liberty and equality...the notion of literature as something pure,
free, and universal."

Casanova's work amounts to a radical remapping of global literary
space--which means, first of all, the recognition that there is a
global literary space. Her insights build on world systems theory, the
idea, developed by Fernand Braudel and Immanuel Wallerstein, that the
capitalist economy that has emerged since about 1500 must be
understood as a single global system of interlinked national
economies. Some of these economies belong to the ruling "core," others
to the dependent "periphery," but none can coherently be studied as a
discrete entity. Casanova, a scholar at the Center for Research in
Arts and Language in Paris, argues, convincingly, that an analogous
literary system, a "world republic of letters," has gradually taken
shape since around the same time. In her analysis, a core group of
nations--France, England and the founders of other "major" European
literatures--having built up large reserves of "literary capital" over
the past several centuries, control the means of cultural legitimation
for the countries of the global literary periphery--a region that, as
in the capitalist world system, has grown ever larger over the past
two centuries with, first, the rise of European nationalism and,
second, decolonization, as nations without previous literary standing,
and writers from those nations, have sought international validation.
And the capital of the world republic of letters, the place to which
even other countries of the core must look for ultimate consecration
and the global reputation it brings, is Paris.

That last idea might damage the English speaker's amour-propre, but
our self-esteem should be diminished even more by the evidence
Casanova marshals to support her thesis. For it is an ongoing source
of shame that so many of the finest exponents even of our own
literature were acclaimed in Paris while still virtually unknown in
London and New York. Faulkner, without a name in the United States
until just three years before winning the 1949 Nobel Prize, was
celebrated in France from as early as 1931. Joyce, though already
recognized within the avant-garde, was unable to find a publisher for
Ulysses until the book was taken up by the great French translator
Valery Larbaud. In later years, Tropic of Cancer, Lolita and Naked
Lunch would join the list of pathbreaking English-language novels
first published in Paris. It was also through France that much of
English literature found an international audience. Casanova lists
Shakespeare, Scott, Byron and Poe among the authors whose works were
long read in French translation, or translations based on the French,
throughout Europe and Latin America. This isn't true just of English
literature, of course, but of all literature, which is why Paris has
been the capital of literary exiles for the past two centuries. And it
is also why Paris is the answer to the question of where translated
writers "come from." Borges and Kundera are just two of the many
authors who became known in the English-speaking world--and the world
in general--only after being consecrated by Paris.

How did this state of affairs come about? Casanova traces the
emergence of an international literary sphere to Joachim du Bellay's
1549 essay "The Defense and Illustration of the French Language,"
which amounted, as she puts it, to a "declaration of war against the
domination of Latin."Over the ensuing century and a half, France built
up its "literary assets" through, among other means, the translation
and imitation of classical models, linguistic standardization and
purification, and the refinement of poetic forms and meters, so that
by the reign of Louis XIV--the age of Pascal, Moli=E8re and
Racine--French had accomplished the unthinkable, displacing Latin as
the language of literary classicism. As a consequence, Casanova
claims, English and other national literary identities emerged in
competition with France. Finally, with the awakening to consciousness
of nations like Germany--nations that, unlike England, Spain or Italy,
had no literary heritage such as would allow them to compete with
France on its own, classical terms--a new means of accumulating
literary assets emerged. This was the path first articulated by
Herder, the eighteenth-century German philosopher and great champion
of folk culture: Instead of deriving from classical antiquity,
literary capital would now originate in a nation's unique soul or
"genius," as expressed in its traditional oral culture--an idea that
would prove crucial not only for the emerging nations of Europe during
the nineteenth century but for the postcolonial world today.

Whatever the terms under which it was conducted, however, it was this
rivalry among national literatures that led to the creation of an
international literary space. Indeed, it led, one might say, to the
creation of literature itself--literature as an autonomous realm--for
it was, paradoxically, through this same struggle that literary values
were asserted independently of national political and moral agendas.
By constituting a transnational sphere in which literature could be
judged on its own terms, this rivalry enabled writers to appeal beyond
their national publics, with their invariably conservative values. It
made possible, in other words, the creation of an avant-garde. (And it
is because of its unique hospitality to the avant-garde that Paris has
endured as the world's literary center.) Here is where Casanova parts
company with the historicism that has swept literary studies over the
past two decades. Rather than tying literary phenomena to underlying
social and political developments, she charts an autonomous history
for literature itself. The world republic of letters is governed by
its own rules, keeps time by its own historical clock, partitions the
world according to its own map and features its own economics, its own
inequalities and its own forms of violence.

Casanova devotes the second half of her book to exploring the means by
which writers from the literary periphery have sought to break into
the center--a myriad of struggles whose existence has heretofore been
concealed by "the fable of an enchanted world...where universality
reigns through liberty and equality." The breadth of her scholarship
here is staggering: from South America to North Africa, Eastern Europe
to East Asia; from the emergent Modernism of Ibsen and Yeats to the
most recent postcolonial hybridities; from "assimilationists" like
Naipaul and Cioran to "rebels" like Neruda and Achebe.

Aside from the uncanny consistency of these strategies across time and
space--a consistency the recognition of which ought to have a
liberating effect on writers working in the loneliness of peripheral
obscurity--two overriding ideas emerge. First, that for well over a
century literary innovation has been driven almost exclusively by the
hunger of marginalized writers for international acceptance. Ibsen,
Joyce, Faulkner, Beckett, Borges, Garc=EDa M=E1rquez, Rushdie: By making
themselves even more modern than Paris, the "Greenwich meridian" of
literary modernity, these great revolutionaries remade the center in
their own image, setting the standards of avant-garde practice for
writers the world over. Second, that for all the inequalities of its
imperial structure, the international literary sphere itself plays a
liberating as much as a dominating role. Even as it forces writers
from marginalized countries to submit to its norms as the price of
recognition, it also frees them from domination by their countries'
own nation-building projects and moral and aesthetic prejudices. Ibsen
appealed to Paris and London in his struggle against Christiania;
Joyce leveraged Paris against both Dublin and London.

Casanova's reluctance to acknowledge the positive dimensions of the
international literary sphere is one of the book's flaws. That
reluctance is ultimately a failure to come to terms with her own
ambivalence, a failure that smacks of political correctness. On the
one hand, she seeks, admirably, to serve the world's marginalized
writers by restoring the "political and historical specificity" of
their work, thus debunking the notion of literary universality as a
product of the "inherent blindnesses of the consecrating authorities."
On the other hand, equally to her credit, she clearly cherishes the
notion of literary universality, of literary values that transcend
political and historical particulars. Granted that her ultimate goal
is "a new literary universality," rejecting her own impulses leads her
to sequester some important truths. First, that writers at the center
are also capable of revolutionary innovation; Modernism began in
France, after all, and Frenchmen like Proust and Robbe-Grillet
continued to play important roles throughout most of the twentieth
century. Second, that peripheral innovation "liberates" the center as
much as it does the rest of the world; only in a footnote does she
admit, for example, that Claude Simon was as much Faulkner's disciple
as was Garc=EDa M=E1rquez. A less doctrinaire, more dialectical
understanding of relations between center and periphery is clearly
needed.

Casanova is also surprisingly enamored of the great-man model of
historical causation. Without du Bellay and Herder, apparently,
literary history would have been completely different. Indeed, her
whole account of the initial emergence of the international literary
sphere, from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, is
sketchy and dubious. Her Francocentrism requires her to minimize
Dante's De vulgari eloquentia, a defense of the vernacular that
preceded du Bellay by two and a half centuries, as well as to obscure
the monumental achievements of sixteenth-century Italian
literature--Ariosto, Tasso, Machiavelli, Castiglione--that ultimately
flowed from it. And far from English literary identity's emerging in
competition with France during the eighteenth century (if anything,
cultural admiration traveled the other way at the time), we already
find the language being defended as equal to Latin, Spanish, French
and Italian around the time of du Bellay--a truer picture of the
international literary space that had already begun to emerge during
the Renaissance. Indeed, for all her remarkable knowledge of global
literary developments, Casanova is surprisingly, even laughably,
ignorant of the English literary scene, asserting at one point that
Shakespeare had not yet become canonical by the turn of the twentieth
century (about two centuries too late) because he was considered
"subversive." Given that Britain has been France's great rival for
literary pre-eminence over the past 400 years, this ignorance is
rather too perfectly ironic.

Still, the main thrust of Casanova's argument, which covers roughly
the last century and a half, is unimpeachable. She has created a map
of global literary power relations where none had existed, and she has
raised a host of further questions. What exactly are the mechanisms
and institutions of legitimation? Just how important, for example, are
book reviewers like me and readers like you? How applicable is her
model to power relations within individual countries? What kinds of
self-betrayals, for example, does New York exact, and what kinds of
resistance does it provoke, from writers from the American hinterland?
How relevant is her model to the other arts? (Undoubtedly, very much
so.) Most important, how relevant is it to the world of today?
Casanova herself acknowledges, in a brief chapter that feels like a
late insertion, that the system of literary internationalism governed
from Paris may have already given way to one of commercial
globalization controlled by mostly American publishing conglomerates.
With the development of mass-produced, globally marketed literary
product that mimics, as Casanova puts it, the style of Modernism--she
mentions "world fiction" like the novels of Umberto Eco and David
Lodge, to which one might add the many books that piggyback on
established literary "brands" (The Dante Club, The Jane Austen Book
Club, Anna in the Tropics, etc.)--true literature, like everything
else of any value, may be on its way to being replaced by a clever
simulacrum of itself.

But the most important question her book raises, for me at least, is
simply this: Why are we so lame? Why is American culture, and the
American intelligentsia in particular, so closed off from what's
happening in the rest of the world? Why do we still need Paris to tell
us what's going on (if we still even listen to it)? If anything, the
situation is more dire than it used to be, when instability or
repression in Europe supplied us with a steady stream of =E9migr=E9s who
acted as a bridge back to their former world. Susan Sontag used to
play a similar role, but she no longer does, and no one's taken her
place. The more we impose our image on the world, it seems, the more
foreign the world becomes.

I want to thank people who have replied.

There _is_ something inert, a quietude or silence, I think - Mairead's
'Poetry doesn't solicit response.  In fact, poetry doesn't seem to
welcome the reader or make any real space.'
- which perhaps separates the poetic, even the call of the poetic, from
the call of everyday speech, the utterance which establishes a framework
for action or communication.
The welcoming must cross the wall of formality, the rhyme or alliteration,
the confluence of tropes. One must give oneself over to the poem.

          [Processing filter "Filter Rule"     ]of "literary capital" over

As far as the mass of incomprehensible unintelligibility, one might say that
of Joyce, of Stein, of a computer program, of any foreign language, of any
risk or wager in language. It may not be too much to expect anyone today
in the humanities to be somewhat familiar with computers, even with the
basics of one or another language or protocol - at least with search
strategies, which, after all, are part or parcel of our everyday behavior.

I can honestly say, from within the interior of my writing, nothing is
incomprehensible; there are reasons for everything, and it is much more
calculated than it might appear. It is not automated or generated in the
sense of a Mozart or Maclow; it may be shaped by program fragments, but it
is shaped for a purpose (i.e. within a sememe I'm concerned about, to the
detriment perhaps of syntactical autonomy). I think of it in some sense as
a break in fluidity and a breaking of the bones of language which we take
for granted; we are witnesses in Solzhenitsyn's sense, but we must make
the language anew, against the sign of capital which corrupts everything
we do. Hence innumerable avant-gardes with their magazines and
institutions of production, quite acceptable, hardly bothering anyone,
perhaps not avant-gardes at all.

There has been critical writing on my work by Maria Damon, among others;
it's not that easily accessible. Sandy Baldwin has also written some, and
there have been a few interviews. I am forgetting as well, for which
apologies. And all of us deserve a Boswell.

More (trying to answer what I remember) - I'm consistently concerned with
meaning, not with stochastic processes. I don't use language generation
devices (although I wrote some programs years ago which did such); I think
constantly of _perception_ and _wonder_ in relation to the real (such as
it is or is not), and how these con/figure language.

I am currently reading - and this plays into my work - Bayle's Various
Thoughts on the Occasion of a Comet; Windows XP Annoyances for Geeks;
Allison/de Olveira/Roberts/Weiss's anthology Psychosis and Sexual Identity
(on Schreber), Thorstein Veblen on the Jews, Dorothy Hayden's A Field
Guide to Sprawl, Kristi Yamaguchi's Figure Skating for Dummies; and
watching http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d310/status.html and
http://www.boeing.com/news/feature/livewebcast/d4_heavy_webcast.htm . Now
some of these works use specialized vocabulary; even the livewebcast is
full of acronyms. It's a learning process and I'm still learning here. By
the way, I recommend the Yamaguchi, Bayle, and Hayden in particular.

Every book such as those mentioned, but every book, is a world, a
psychosis itself, closed, fortified, defended. Every variation is a final
text, every one a production involving energy, labor, language, process.
In at least one sense, every book is equivalent to every other - in this
sense of worlding, the diegetic process opening to the reader.

My work concerns the bones: of the book, of language, of the substructure
that conveys these particular words to you, as if they 'came' from me.

To ignore these basic issues of electronic distributivity is to write on
the surface of water. The issues: protocols, codes, codework, intellectual
property, spam, noise, dissolution, cohesion, variation, transitive
processes of all sorts that modify, redeploy, destroy, reconstruct,
recuperate, wound, heal, ignore, procure, what might have passed for the
words or worry-words of the author.

I honestly believe my work is as incomprehensible as the world we're
living in - with its deep incoherencies, clashes of epistemes and even
ontologies. In other words, both require pathing, studying, and certainly
not returning to a fundamentalism of literature, genre, religion, or any
other. That way lies disaster.

As perhaps does the thickness of my own writing and its continuation.

Now the reason for the query, this writing in absolute silence - I don't
have the luxury of teaching or institution; what I do, I do clumsily on my
own, in relative isolation in Brooklyn. There is little discussion with my
friends. The writing is a solitude which splits, Pessoa. It is also a
noise which coalesces, Siratori. I beg for feedback, hopefully
constructive. For my own sanity, I have to send to /dev/null the rest, the
condition of my kill file.

Why every day? Because this is what I do, what shapes the work. And no,
it's not just turned out randomly or at speed; everything is gone over,
over and over again, and a lot of material is scrapped. If I don't write,
I don't sleep, don't function. I wrote once to the effect that I write
myself into existence; I write myself out of existence - such as it is.
The existence is a fetal bubble, nothing more.

     over "cover-up" that may leave F.B.I. "holding theive strong attention
to a
21771 q6 R+   0:00.00
     bag" for abuses.

Hi Alan - and Listers

I want to emphasize that I in no way felt it was "an incomprehensible
mass" - your (Alan's) work has a  density and complexity that is
incredible - and I have always been fascinated by what you (Alan) are doing
(while sometimes exasperated and sometimes baffled  and sometimes too tired
to read a particular post - BUT I don't agree with someone who said "why do
it .." that question is really "why write poetry ..."  - it is one of those
questions which is ok  (but asks a lot of other question such as "what is
poetry?"
 -nothing wrong with that but its going off onto another subject - although
it could be argued that Alan's work asks just that : what indeed, is a poem?
A text etc? A modern work? and so on..) but coupled with: "incomprehensible
mass" - such as question or allegation is ambiguous -

Steve Dalachinsky asks whether or why it is an issue - well the reason or
prompt that motivated my first email on this was that I was reading through
your (Alan's) posts (the work done this year) and making a big effort to get
onto them - I was suggesting that some people might feel that way - I was in
fact giving feedback.  I felt that that was good way to make a response -
its not good enough fro me to say "this is a lovely poem" and so on - what
you are doing requires real work from the reader I feel (we owe it to all
poets to give close attention to their work and give them respect -as far as
possible)

And why is it an issue? - It is an issue -it is a very human thing - nearly
a vital thing to need and respond to feedback (and to give feedback )  to
what one is doing or to one's communications - how could a singer feel
without an audience? I mean a professional  singer - eg  a concert of any
music (of whatever style or genre) requires and audience and often immediate
feedback - the feedback can in turn energise the performer/creator).

And I think that it is important that though we write partly for ourselves -
that writing or any creative activity is always on one level for our own
creative enjoyment and fulfilment - we, as humans in a social world  - we
are social beings - always want feed back (its almost a genetic necessity) -
imagine talking to a group of people (who you were or are friends with) and
suddenly no one answers - the silent treatment is terrible - its maybe
shouldn't be - but it is -  we need feedback.
Sure - we can be capable of driving on regardless and that is good - but
Emily Dickinson did that - went there.  Alan's project is one that needs
feedback and even participation.

I think that we are seeing an extraordinary work unfolding here which has
great significance for 20./21st Century Literature

I started a poem up the other day and named it "The Sondheim Effect" - it
shows the influence of Alan on here...

Alan Sondheim in my book has gone way past the Language poets while
incorporating concepts generated from that movement - he is immensely
talented even as a "pure poet".  It is as if we had been privileged to
witness the making of Finnegan's Wake - or the writing of King Lear.

My work concerns the bones: of the book, of language, of the substructure
that conveys these particular words to you, as if they 'came' from me.
<snip>

Yes. That feels exactly right.

As does this:

<snip>
There _is_ something inert, a quietude or silence, I think - Mairead's
'Poetry doesn't solicit response.  In fact, poetry doesn't seem to
welcome the reader or make any real space.'
<snip>

Except that I'd probably substitute 'impassive' for 'inert'. It's how the
bones behave when the flesh falls away.

I too read your work quite regularly, if not always on this List.

Alan, I always read the ones with words in them, and every once in a
while I love one and send it on to friends--same with your occasional
reading reports. The computer stuff I scroll through, considering it
a form of vis-po or graphics. When you do so much you can't expect
strokes every time--we're all overloaded, not by you particularly.
Keep your spirits up--the days are getting longer now. Sylvester

" ...all that's left of my body. . .

"it's been nothing nothing since the beginning of the game" - is an
exquisite something something which i recognize, connect with, the  track on your cd
"i thought it was the end of the world then the end of the  world happened
again".

steve, would you be so kind as to post at Poetics or send to me - the words
for this poem.
and thanks for kenneth patchen, "when we were here together". he's from
wisconsin, my state of origin, but wouldn't have heard of him, being uneducated
and all. it has a good connection for me. i'lll visit lorca next. and who
couldn't love "the wor(l)ds more full of weeping" ?

you're one of the warm poets here, thanks

The next issue of _moria_ (www.moriapoetry.com) is online.  It contains
poetry, theory articles, and reviews by:

bill lavender   jordan stempleman
eric elshtain   thomas fink
tracey gagne'   diana magallon
jennifer chapis neil oney
guatam verma    shin yu pai
sally ann mcintyre
william james austin
bruna mori              michael lohr
van g garett.

As usual I'm looking for poetry, theory articles, and reviews for future
issues.  I am especially interested in receiving more theory articles on
"experiemental" poetry for the next issue.

We're in the midst of our first winter snowstorm here in Forest, Ohio, but
I'm stocked up on wine and children. Here are some great ways to stay
connected:

Download from xpressed some of our list poets, particularly Alan, Vernon  &
Steve
_http://www.xpressed.org/_ (http://www.xpressed.org/)

Or how about Vernon's Song of the Baobab, Slam, or Sex Queen of the Berlin
Turnpike; or Steve's incomplete directions and i thought it was the end  ...

Great stuff. Thanks, guys for your warm words and encouragement. You all
prove that spontaneity can be art. Afterall, the words only flow from warm
bodies, which are living, which words create in the first place. Right words in
the right place at the right time. Not writing, not philosophy, not ideas,  just
alive.

That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Hello all,

Here's an update regarding Michael Rothenberg.

SNAIL MAIL:

The nursery in Pacifica is operational and receiving mail as usual. Any
letters or donations for Michael or Nancy can be sent to that address. It
might be smart to earmark anything sent if you want it to go to something or
someone specifically. Nancy and Cosmos are moving into a rental house in the
next days. No address on that yet.

Address in Pacifica:
 c/o Shelldance, 2000 Highway One, Pacifica CA 94044

BOOKS:

Some people have asked if they could send books to Michael, since much of
his library is gone. As Michael is returning to Florida around the beginning
of the year, it would be best to hold off on that gesture, maybe better to
send him a short e-mail on what you would like to send and then follow
through when he settles back home. Michael is planning to move from the
Florida residence in 2005, most likely back West although that's not been
decided. I'm collecting Philip's 40-some-odd books of poetry for Michael and
will send them to him when he moves next year. There are similar efforts
among his friends to help build up what was a spectacular library.

E-MAIL:
Michael's got his computer now, although he's not been able to answer much
of the slew of incoming e-mail. He says he'll catch up when he gets back to
Florida and he is buoyed by the outpouring of cyber support. That's not an
exact quote, but you get the idea...


That's it for now.

Thanks for your kindness and
happy holidays to those who celebrate.

Best Regards,
Suzi Winson

Gated Community Gives Bums Rush To Nativity Scene:
Residents Say Holy Family 'Too Arab; Too Poor':
By JEFFEY LUBE


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Just wanted to let folks know I'll be in Philly during the MLA
and I would love to (re)connect with anybody visiting, or living there,
while I'm there. I'm told my conversational abilities can be
entertain(t)ing.

Feel free to call me at 415-260-7535 as I won't be able to access email
after tomorrow.
Thanks, Chris

Credo or The Writing in Quantity

The texts are written by a dead man.
To miss or waste a single day or hour, is to succumb to death.
Every text is an epitaph.
The body of writing is a collocation of epitaphs.
The body of writing is the epitaphic written body.
Writing decays into the semblance of a corpse.
Quantity topples quantity.
Of the talisman, there is nothing to be said.

What is Next-Gen Nanopoetics

This is a genre of literature that uses truncated textstrings or =
abbreviated phrases for lines of "verse". Each group of lines make up a =
stanza. The lines follow a pattern like ABCABC which would look like =
this:

hello my name is
 the farmer milks
   san diego grocer
hello my name is
 the farmer milks
   san diego grocer



The patterns can be very long like ABCABCABC and complex like ABCDABEF =
or ABACDCABCD and so on.

Now for the text in this series called "Biospheres and Sacred Grooves" I =
have used as a text source the keywords that people have used to find =
one of my websites (over 35)

I truncate the keyword strings and sequence them using a tool I =
developed that is pretty simple and versatile and fast.



The following two pieces follow an ABCDABEF pattern. The two pieces are =
actually excerpts from a 1,000-page volume titled "Biospheres and Sacred =
Grooves #0001". There are 1,000 volumes. As many of you know, I am =
interested very much in producing massive quantities of literary =
material.

A Black Panther education: An inner-view with Akua Njeri

Part 1

by Ra'shida

Khadijah (left) stands with her grandmother, Akua, her father, Young
Chairman Fred Hampton Jr., and Mrs. Walker, the mother of Michael
Walker, the unarmed victim of holice terrorist murder on Oct. 11, 2002,
in the Cabrini Green projects in Chicago. This picture was taken on
National Revolutionary Day, Dec. 4, 2002, on the site where Chairman
Fred Hampton Sr. and Defense Capt. Mark Clark of the Illinois chapter of
the Black Panther Party were assassinated on Dec. 4, 1969


She is an example for Black people and other oppressed races of people
to follow while the many bombs that the Ammerklan government has dropped
on her throughout her life have not run her away or stopped her from
fighting for her people. She shows us that you have to come back with a
stronger revolutionary spirit after each time this white supremacist
imperialist police nation drops a bomb to kill you.

Through her battles, we see how and why we must continue to fight
against anti-African terrorism even harder despite the vicious attacks
and murders committed against our sisters, brothers, parents and
children to stop our fight for freedom. Her life shows us that a true
revolutionary stands by the people and for the people at all times. We
appreciate this Black Warrior Goddess for her true and unyielding
commitment and passion to liberate African people.

Take a moment to hear about her life in the struggle.

Ra'shida: What influenced you to join the Black Panther Party?

Akua: I was 17 years old when I joined the Black Panther Party. Police
terrorism was rampant in Black communities across this country. The
Black community was under attack on all fronts: housing issues in the
community with slumlords charging exorbitant rents for life threatening
housing situations; avaricious, greedy, businessmen exploiting our
communities selling inferior products. Our people were under attack on
every front. I believed in the 10-point platform of the Party. My
brother brought home a flier saying "The Black Panthers Are Here" with a
picture of a Black Panther that appeared to be walking across the page.
I heard about the Panthers in Chicago taking over classrooms at city
college campuses like Kennedy King (then Wilson Junior College) and
demanding "an education that teaches us our true history and our role in
present day society."

Ra'shida: What were some of your duties as a young Panther?

Akua: Panthers had to sell 250 papers every week. Now that was not that
hard to do. The Black Panther Newspaper went really fast because the
Panther paper told what was really happening in our communities. Like
Malcolm X said on an occasion, you could go and participate in a
demonstration and by the time you saw that same demonstration on the
television, it don't look like the same demonstration you were in. We
see that today.

In other words, what we get from mainstream media is so far removed from
reality ... For instance, we can look at the information that we are fed
about the "war" - oops, I mean "Operation Iraq Liberation." It is
definitely not the reality of how the people view the U.S. invasion, nor
the massacre of thousands of women and children, who are actually 50
percent of the Iraqi population.

People knew they could get the BPP paper and find out what was going on
in the world. People could see how the pigs were murdering people in not
just their community, but black communities across the country. People
being framed on bogus charges, the foul treatment by slumlords,
avaricious greedy businessmen and politicians. Also, the courageous
resistance of revolutionaries all over the world against capitalism and
U.S. imperialism: all of this could be found in the Black Panther
Newspaper.

Some people had a hard time selling papers. Chairman Fred would go out
in the middle of the busy street on Madison stopping cars and knocking
on windows saying, "Hey, Brother, hey Sister, did you get your Black
Panther Newspaper? I know you heard about the pigs killing one of the
sisters or brothers in the community." Like Minister Huey P. Newton
said, "Observation and Participation." Panthers saw their leadership
working in the trenches with them. The people learned by example.

At 5 a.m., Panthers would go to this schoolyard to drill. We would be
marching and chanting, even in the dead of winter. That would get us on
charge to go out and do our day's activities. We would then hit the "L"
(similar to BART) trains selling the BP Newspaper to the people going to
work in the a.m. rush hour.

Wherever there was space - community centers, churches with kitchens -
the Black Panther Party established the "Free Breakfast for Children
Program." The sites would open at about 7 a.m. Keep in mind that the
Black Panther Party established Breakfast Programs all over the country
before the state had any free breakfast or lunch. The Free Breakfast
Program was based on the 10-point platform as were all the survival
programs put in place by the Party. The Black Panther Party went out and
demanded that the stores in the community give back to the community
through donations to the Breakfast Program.

One of the places we had the Breakfast Program was located in the
Englewood community. A 15- or 16-year-old brother, Walter Johnson, who
was a high school student, was responsible for the Free Breakfast
program at Our Redeemer Church. He was responsible for the work of
section leaders on the whole South Side of Chicago.

The Party attracted Black people from every sector of the community.
Every age level participated, brothers and sisters, people who had
nothing, people who thought they had something. This was a time when
Black Power was the order of the day. People would greet each other with
"Black Power" and "Power to the People."

The Illinois chapter would feed over 3,000 children per week at the
various sites in Chicago. The Free Breakfast Program was not a charity.
It was to organize the people to participate in their own struggle for
liberation. Children would go home telling their parents about the
Panther's Breakfast Program. The parents would go and check out the
sites 'cause they would hear all this negative publicity from the
state's media.

The Panthers were portrayed as a violent gang wanting to kill all the
white people. Parents came down and saw that the centers were clean;
children were being fed and were being politically educated about what
was happening to them in the community. We explained that "We Serve and
Protect" that was emblazoned on the doors of the pig cars had nothing to
do with the pigs serving and protecting the interests of the people. In
fact, the pigs were an occupying army in our community serving and
protecting the interests of the state against the interests of the
people. Beating, shooting and locking the people up is the modus
operandi of this occupying army, not some fluke that just happened.

The Breakfast Program exposed the contradiction of how this government
of the richest country in the world would force children to go to school
to be miseducated on an empty stomach. The Black Panther Party was
educating and feeding the children with the most powerful of all
resources: organizing the people to make "Power to the People" a
reality. Parents, through "observation and participation," would begin
to work in the survival programs and run them.

Look for Part 2 of this inner-view next week. Email Ra'shida at

poets in the United States. She's the author of more than 20 books of
poetry, fiction and essays, and her Selected Poems (2000) was awarded
the prestigious Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize in 2001. Howe's bracing new
poems respond with moving clarity to the contrast between current
political tides and the realities of life lived "on the ground."

In the title poem she writes:

So go away before I ask to know

what you mean about wanting to go

Terrified of being first?

of being dirt?

Of being ambushed or embossed? Personally

I want to batter my way out of this cage of psychology

and get to the longing I really know about

Howe's most distinctive characteristic involves her "intense stations of
belief," and her abiding sense of the spiritual. In an essay titled
"Bewilderment," Howe writes that "one definition of the lyric might be
that it is a method of searching for something that can't be found. It
is an air that blows and buoys and settles. It says, 'Not this, not
this,' instead of, 'I have it.' " In the new poem "Medjugorje," she
writes:

I wish I was Jesus

with baby Mary

a gold string theory

built out of twos!

I wish I was that yellow

strand that dribbled

like spittle

into the people's eyes

because it was a person

without a name

and God roared down

This is the second and last time!

Formally, Howe's main mode is the serial poem (individual sections that
form a larger associative aggregate poem). In that essay "Bewilderment"
Howe writes that "to me, the serial poem is a spiral poem," adding that
"in this poetry circling can take form as sublimations, inversion,
echolalia, digression, glossolalia, and rhymes."

The central question running throughout her writing has to do with how
art takes its place in a life. In her new serial poem "Forged," she
writes:

Did I believe or was it hope

Like a fir tree in a children's nursery

candlelights on thistleballs

at a village called Manningtree

Funny how children continue to call Mummy

to a woman and her law at a table

that she may turn all words back into the prayers

that they once were

"Kneeling Bus" provides yet another example of Howe's private theology:

I'll defy emptiness

instead of dying

I'll follow Jesus onto the M11

with my sack of apples

and smile like the nanny

at 67th and Columbus

in fake fur and dark glasses,

a child's hand in hers.

For Howe, the act of asking questions goes to the heart of a poetics
defined by bewilderment: "The human heart... in a state of bewilderment,
doesn't want to answer questions as much as to lengthen the resonance of
those questions." In a later section of "Kneeling Bus," Howe
emphatically writes:

All this has to happen to everyone without exception.

Now answer these questions:

Why is the messiah dumped in a pit?

Why is the messiah scorned and laughed at?

Why does the messiah wear his heart

on his chest and then point at it?

No answer. That's why.

Her commitment to social justice notwithstanding, Howe's writing does
not directly aspire to convert human nature to a more ideal system.
Confronted with perplexing realities, Howe does not seek to extinguish
them. In "9/11" she writes:

Like winners taking the hit

Like looking down on Utah as if

It was Saudi Arabia or Pakistan

Like war-planes out of Miramar

Like a split cult a jolt of coke New York

Like Mexico in its deep beige couplets

Like this, like that... like Call us all It

Thou It. "Sky to Spirit! Call us all It!"

Howe not only acknowledges bewilderment as an inescapable quality of
life; she also endorses it as an artistic, political and spiritual act.

ah Lawrence, look at this:

This is the Postfix program at host mail.move.it.

I'm sorry to have to inform you that the message returned
below will not be sent to Dante or to his other destinations.

He told me to tell you to leave him alone.
No further assistance will be given.

If you do not do so, you can delete yourself from the face
of the moon, sky and stars, and remember you've been forgotten.

This is quite confusing. I was under the assumption there was a
'pataphyscial imperative that all dead poets achieve immortality by
remaining contactable via email, forever and ever.  This will need to
be brought to the College de 'pataphysics for further examination.

as all of us who've ever organized a reading with a large group of readers
knows, 1/2 stick to the amount of time assigned, 1/4 go up and read one poem
and go way under the assigned time, while a 1/4 read for way more than their
assigned time.

godspeed jena.

What kind of speeding tickets does God give poets?
Particularly if they are going slow in the fast lane?

Happy Yuletide, everyone.
And 'out of Iraq' ASAP, Mr. RumsfeldCheneyWolfolitzetcBush.
& may the MLA'ers have the courage to speak to that.

the pilot light wish list

light as light in subfreezing ripstop ...
light after all this new night that's all unanimously green light ...
light on shortfall can leave in extremely higher surprise ...
light is something bright in aging earthtimes seized a carousel radio
...
light which ended will feature midnight candle's window, soft over
aging peace ...
light in the laser deceleration slightly showing his modest bell
ringer, a name he danced ...
light activity closed for future composite to the pilot light wish list
...
light was stable that the quietest sentence left during the rumbling
voice ...
light directly the (garden) of the square sphere huddled together a
chorus of intelligence ...
light (fireworks) on a smooth, tough gazette spirt behind our stone
wall ...
light will save technologies at the top of a doorway, and you'll have
some match-making ...
light nudges light almost changing on the daily distance in the real ...
light shares festive drift to staring at the dark propelling after
adorned with special meaning ...
light represents a spotlight filled from a touch from results that
rarely ...
light years put us in the top and we'll probably start there next year

theyre back

doctor leopold konninger and nikuko are on the floor of the theater.
theyre naked, theyre always naked. theyre dirty, filthy, rolling around on
the boards, slight cuts, abrasions. theyre impossibly drunk, drugged,
theres an audience. theyre fucking but not cumming. doctor leopold
konningers cock is hard, nikukos labia are swollen. theyre fingering each
other, sucking everything in sight, the site, theyre mouths. they spread
each others asses for the audience, pure exhibition, perfect theater. you
can smell them, anyone can smell them. the dancer comes out then. the
dancers also naked or maybe wears a leotard which he tears off. he dances
around them, circles in on them, takes them over. hes getting erect, his
cock is harder and harder. hes watching them, hes brushing against them.
theyre taking over by not taking over. theyre paying no attention, theyre
the ground, the foundation, the material substrate of the world,
background radiation of the universe. theyre sweaty, slippery, between
solid and liquid, their faces flushed, their limbs groping. the dancers
over them, they're beneath him, incredibly beneath him, all the way down,
the end of the tunnel or funnel. he begins touching himself, hes
pirouetting, theyre circular moving. his cock begins to drip, its swollen,
hes moving faster and faster, hes shuddering, theyre shuddering beneath
him, his feet against them, in between them, around them. his toes enter
them, hes dancing furiously, theyre oblivious, theyre in their own world,
their mouths wider and wider, sucking, inhaling, eating, drinking, every
hole, every limb. hes cumming now, hes cumming on them, he aims his cock
down at them, theyre coated in him, they rub the cum in, rub it around
them, between them, in their mouths, eyes, holes, the cock of doctor
leopold konninger, the cunt of nikuko. the dancer might shudder and halt,
he might leave, he might stay to see what happens, he might remain above
them, he might move to the side. nikukos cunt is spread wide and open for
the audience, she spreads doctor leopold konningers asshole for the
audience, she puts some of the dancers cum inside her, doctor leopold
konninger licks it out, places some in his asshole. theyre moving faster
and faster, the dancer is forgotten, the dancer disappears, theyre
bruised, abrasions, then also where the dancer pressed against them, where
his feet entered them. theyre feeling nothing and everything, the floors
slippery with their skin, with cum, feces, urine, saliva, sweat, theyre
the color of earth, color of the floor, hysteric, delirious, theyre out of
their minds. the lights go down, theyve cum or not cum, theyve finished or
not finished, the smells thick with the audience, they love the dancing,
love the dancer, his movement they think was masterful, theyd never seen
such good dancing, it was most wonderful dancing, incredible, amazing.
theyre wet, theyve cum in their seats, their minds remembering the perfect
evening, they leave, doctor leopold konninger and nikuko are swollen,
theyre biting each other, theres blood, theres no one around, theyre at
it, they continue at it, theyre in the dark, theyre on the other side of
the curtain, theyre on the other side of the world, theyre doing it,
theyre never stopping, theyre chafed, theyre torn, theyre bleeding, theyre
going on.

Summary: Rumsfeld's Aura Terrifies Troops in Iraq

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Administration Overhauls Rules for U.S. Forests

December 23, 2004
  By FELICITY BARRINGER





Correction Appended

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 - The Bush administration issued broad
new rules Wednesday overhauling the guidelines for managing
the nation's 155 national forests and making it easier for
regional forest managers to decide whether to allow
logging, drilling or off-road vehicles.

The long-awaited rules relax longstanding provisions on
environmental reviews and the protection of wildlife on 191
million acres of national forest and grasslands. They also
cut back on requirements for public participation in forest
planning decisions.

Forest Service officials said the rules were intended to
give local foresters more flexibility to respond to
scientific advances and threats like intensifying wildfires
and invasive species. They say the regulations will also
speed up decisions, ending what some public and private
foresters see as a legal and regulatory gridlock that has
delayed forest plans for years because of litigation and
requirements for time-consuming studies.

"You're trying to manage towards how we want the forest to
look and be in the future," said Rick D. Cables, the Forest
Service's regional forester for the Rocky Mountain region.

The rules give the nation's regional forest managers and
the Forest Service increased autonomy to decide whether to
allow logging roads or cellphone towers, mining activity or
new ski areas.

Environmental groups said the new rules pared down
protection for native animals and plants to the point of
irrelevance. These protections were a hallmark of the 1976
National Forest Management Act.

"The new planning regulations offer little in the way of
planning and nothing in the way of regulation," the
conservation group Trout Unlimited said in a statement.

Martin Hayden, a lawyer with Earthjustice, a law firm
affiliated with the Sierra Club, accused the administration
of watering down protections "that are about fish and
wildlife, that are about public participation, or about
forcing the agency to do anything other than what the
agency wants to do."

"What you are left with is things that are geared toward
getting the sticks out," Ms. Hayden said.

The original 1976 law on forest management was intended to
ensure that regional managers showed environmental
sensitivity in decisions on how the national forests would
be used. During the 1990's, the Clinton administration
sought major revisions in the rules governing how the act
was carried out. But the Clinton-era regulation was not
completed in time to take effect before President Bush
assumed office.

The new rules incorporate an approach that has gained favor
in private industries from electronics to medical device
manufacturing. The practice, used by companies like Apple
Computer, allows businesses to set their own environmental
goals and practices and then subjects them to an outside
audit that judges their success.

These procedures are called environmental management
systems. When the Forest Service started investigating
these systems, said Fred Norbury, a deputy associate chief
at the Forest Service, "what we discovered to our surprise
is that the U.S. is a little behind the rest of the world
and we in government are a little behind the curve."

In the case of the Forest Service, the supervisors of the
individual forests and grasslands will shape forest
management plans, and the effects of those will be subject
to independent audits.

The auditors the Forest Service chooses could range from
other Forest Service employees to outsiders, said Sally
Collins, an associate chief at the Forest Service. She said
the auditors could come from an environmental group or an
industry group like timber "or a ski area, local citizens
or a private contractor."

Forest supervisors are appointed by the Forest Service to
manage national forests and report to regional managers.
Some are more supportive of pro-timber policies, while
others are more steeped in the environmental ethos.

One of the ways the new rules give forest supervisors more
power is that they are allowed to approve plans more
quickly for any particular forest use - ranging from
recreation to logging to grazing - and to adjust plans with
less oversight.

For instance, an existing requirement to keep all fish and
wildlife species from becoming threatened or endangered is
jettisoned. In its place is a requirement that managers
consider the best available science to protect all natural
resources when they are making decisions.

Michael D. Ferrucci, a partner in the Connecticut
consulting firm Interforest and a former forest manager who
now performs audits for private industry and state
governments, said Wednesday: "I personally think the
flexibility implied in this approach is terrific. It will
help to unlock the power and creativity of a lot of good
people."

He added: "Most environmentalists and most scientists who
follow forestry understand that more flexibility is needed.
But there is a risk of making some of the mistakes we made
20 and 25 years ago. The mistake we made was to be a little
too narrowly focused on the timber side." In the 1980's,
extensive logging took place in places like the Tongass
National Forest in Alaska and Oregon's old growth forests.

But Chris Wood, the vice president for conservation at
Trout Unlimited, warned that the new approach would require
a heavy financial commitment to ensure enough people could
monitor the impact of regulations and alert managers to
problems.

Amy Mall, a forestry specialist at the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group, said in a
statement: "The rule is illegal. It rips the guts out of
National Forest management plans. It doesn't ensure that
the Forest Service provides the necessary resources to
implement plans."

The final rule requires forest managers to comply with the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, the
cornerstone of the current environmental regulations on
government and industry.

But an accompanying proposal - which is open to public
comment for 60 days - gives managers new discretion on what
kind of environmental review constitutes compliance.

Mr. Norbury of the Forest Service said that under this
proposal, the forest supervisor would be making the call as
to whether a particular plan must undergo a full
environmental impact statement, a more modest review or no
formal review.

In Congress, where partisan divisions over environmental
protections have grown more acute in recent years, the new
rules were greeted with enthusiasm by Republican leaders
and anger by Democrats.

Representative Richard W. Pombo, the chairman of the
Republican-controlled House Resources Committee, hailed the
change, saying that currently "the process is so burdensome
and time consuming that the plans are obsolete before they
are finished."

But Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Agriculture Committee, said, "The Bush
administration's new plan threatens to derail decades of
progress in that direction by backing away from
longstanding, bipartisan commitments to nontimber resources
like wildlife, public involvement and scientific review."

Correction: December 24, 2004, Friday:

Because of an
editing error, a front-page article yesterday about new
rules for managing the national forests referred
incorrectly in some copies to a representative of
Earthjustice who criticized the plan. The representative is
a man, Martin Hayden. The article also misstated his title
and, because of another editing error, described
Earthjustice incorrectly. Mr. Hayden is the organization's
legislative director but is not a lawyer. Earthjustice is
an environmental law firm, not affiliated with the Sierra
Club.

in grading papers i came across a batch of poems i'd asked my
students rather spontaneously to write, with the subject header as
the title: election day blues.  one anonymous stroke of genius reads
thus:
one state
two state
red state
two state
this one has a stupid star
this one has a stupid car
say, what a lot of stupid states there are

hi all,

shiv mirabito, who edits Shivastan Publishing and organizes readings in
Woodstock, is looking for a subletter for his cabin there (info below).

best,
david

--------

subletter wanted for cozy cabin in woodstock ny:

i am making my annual pilgrimage to india/nepal from january 9th to april
9th & still have not found the perfect caring person to live in my pad- it
is a big studio with lots of light, plants, video-dvd-stereo, cozy furniture
& a warm open fire soapstone stove. it is right in the center of woodstock
(3 minute walking distance to bus stop, cafes, bars, sushi, etc). the sublet
is for 3 months- $700 a month everything included (no electric, phone or
heating bills) & will be the perfect place for someone (or a couple) wanting
to get out of the city, write, make art, meditate (great tibetan monastary
in town), etc. please email me at shivastan@hotmail.com asap if you are
interested- namaste, shiv mirabito

... if I published the entire list of email addresses on the Poets'
Corner under _emails_ quoting the author of each one, do you think it
is a good idea? If anybody does not like it, just let me know, you can
b/c, I will never tell the others it was you...
I'll say I have a strong headache, which is what I have, and mine will

The aim of the poet is to awaken emotions in the soul, not to gather admirers.

Miekal, I like this reply! So many calls I get are rootless and, if not
rootless, like old Sam Beckett, I get left on "Call Waiting."

Better to stoke what stuff you have in real time ('root your own')seems the
implied message.  Still, it wd be nice to get the news from beyond. I guess
we will have to stay in with the records, books, and other remaining
fingerprints.=20

Unless, Miekal, you are willing to give us your secret line.

Dear friends:

Please don't forget to join us on Tuesday, 12/28 for an Atticus/Finch
showcase (see below for details). Headlining: Eli Drabman in support
of his chap, _the ground running_. Tanya Brolaski will read from her
_The Daily Usonian_, and I will read from something. There promises to
be some manner of honkey-tonk music following.

+++++++++++++++++
Dear Friends,
It wouldn't be December without a house reading
situated between holidays! Situate yourself in my
house and come see Michael Cross, who'll be in from
Buffalo, and celebrate with him the beautiful ATTICUS
FINCH chapbook series, featuring Tanya Brolaski's THE
DAILY USONIAN and Eli Drabman's THE GROUND RUNNING.

Festivities begin with potluck at 6:30. Reading starts
at 7:30.
Tuesday, December 28
1336 4th Avenue
San Francisco
@Irving/ Parnassus
Like BART? take it to Civic Center, then get off and
take the N outbound. It stops at 4th & Irving.
Don't like BART? get off the freeway at either Duboce/
Mission or Civic Center. Duboce: Follow Duboce to
Market, turn left on Market then go up 17th St. when
Market hits Castro (be in right lane). Follow 17th
over the hill to Stanyan, turn left on Parnassus, turn
right on 4th.
The real miracle of Xmas is that parking lightens up
significantly in my neighborhood, as all the med
students are home doing their laundry.

Please forward!
Love, Kelly

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

              Axial Stones & Works on Paper
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

Happily the show will go to a seventh week, ending on Jan. 6th --
holidays excepted  (might be best to call to confirm days -- 212-242-4519).


Baumgartner Gallery is pleased to announce its inaugural exhibition at
the new 522 West 24th Street location, presenting a selection of John
Cage's celebrated New River Watercolors and George Quasha's new Axial
Stones & Drawings.
November 19, 2004  -  January 6th, 2005


Revolutionary composer, poet/writer, and artist, John Cage made a series
of watercolors in 1988 at the Mountain Lake Workshop in Virginia; he
used stones from New River, which were arranged systematically with art
materials (colors, papers, brushes & feathers, etc.) and employed
according to I Ching-based chance operations. These visual works
represent a high point in Cage's famous displacement of "choice" from
the level of taste, personal emotion, and aesthetic judgment to that of
a non-personalist modality of engaging materials and process. "My
choices," he said "consist in choosing what questions to ask."  The work
on paper preserves the traces of an event, an energy field of material
expression, where things speak for themselves in unforeseen ways and
retain their freshness year after year.

In his mid 20s George Quasha met John Cage and felt his own work as poet
and artist "reoriented," although he himself never embraced systematic
chance operations.  (Later his Station Hill Press published Cage's
Themes & Variations.)  Quasha's sense of the axial, as the principle
pervading all of his work (whether sculpture, drawing, video, language,
or performance), offers a parallel to Cage's intention to discover
uniqueness and radical newness in each instance of composition, whatever
the medium.

Quasha's axial stones are the result of subtle attractions and unique
acts of balance.  He discovers individual stones, usually in or near
rivers, and, according to the artist, "waits (minutes, days, years)
until they discover each other"; he then "performs their act of union
through radical balance, without changing the stones in any way and
without any kind of stickum."  He "works them, on an invisible axis,
toward their most precarious point, the optimal statement of apparent
impossibility"; this is the point where "a stone seems on the verge of
switching elements, a liminality of earth and air."   They "remain on
edge, pre-climactic, impermanent, yet well seated in their perilous
retention."

The axial drawings present a related event in the medium of graphite on
paper.  "The axial does not suggest a method or style but a principle,
which, unlike the conceptual, can have no definitive expression; instead
it generates ever new instances of itself."  A "state of free moving
intentionality, it finds formal integrity on the fly." Despite a
sometimes surprising elegance in the drawing, it is in fact an
unrepeatable event -- a skill-defying act that restores the artist to
"zero point" -- a momentary innocence rather than mastery.  What appears
is an "integrating energy" that is neither abstract nor figurative, but
configurative -- "a site of possible figuration with no hold on formal
consistency."  Axial drawing here means "graphite exciting paper to open
its aperture to an other side."


beauty = precarious x optimal

George Quasha's work in installation and video includes "art is:
Speaking Portraits (in the performative indicative"), an ongoing project
exhibited at White Box, November 16 through 27 (525 West 26th Street);
it is currently audible on WPS1, the all-art internet station of
PS1/MoMA.  (Details of the work at www.artis-online.net.)   "art is" has
previously been exhibited at the Snite Museum of Art, the International
Media Art  Biennale WRO 03 (Wroclaw), 10th Biennial of Moving Images
(Saint-Gervais, Geneva), Bunkier Sztuki (Krakow), World Social Forum 04
(Bombay), etc.  His thirteen books include: art writing (four books and
nine catalogues on artist Gary Hill, including Tall Ships, HanD
HearD/liminal objects, Viewer, and Language Willing),  poetry (five
books, including Ainu Dreams and forthcoming The Preverbs of Tell), and
anthologies  (America a Prophecy, Open Poetry, and The Station Hill
Blanchot Reader). His Axial Stones will be published by North Atlantic
Books.  He continues his twenty year performance and video/language
collaboration with Gary Hill and Charles Stein, most recently in
performing "mind on the line" in Poland (Wroclaw, Lodz, and Posnan) and
the Czech Republic (Prague), December 1-10.

That is a beautiful way to put it - I have never seen snow fall - as in
Auckland - New Zealand  it never snows - but I have seen snow fall in movies
etc

I have seen snow - but only three times in my life - (of course it snows a
lot further south and so on ..but I am not a great traveller)

Have a great Xmas season - and all others

to understand what things meant would be tragic. A failure=20

of nervousness. I cant gesticulate enough. Ape me you. Thus I.

Disastrous. A bolt. About this time the green and blue music

entered on harrying tip toe to a grandstand cacophony=20

as if a nation had been slaughtered. Reality kept on: we=20

couldnt fix that, but there were pressing intrusions. I want you: you

want. He wants, she wants, they want. Everyone wants. There is a =
heaviness

blacks the land. What is it with you? It's...Christ it's getting hot. =
Plant something. Are they caming?  Will they be caming? What's that? =
Who's this? And so on as a thousand vermilion vermin settled in. Ours of =
course to laud and chuckle over as the chairs rock unattended and vacant =
of personas. The wind, apropos of nowt, whips the air and all become =
involved in the drama with the chilling fingers and maybe the Laocoon. =
The death that young men yearn for. They keep wandering. A hundred =
thousand died last week and things are everywhere. And they flash or =
wink in a violent opposition of clangs, bangs, and clashes of =
shatter-light. All this and more: and still more, setting store and we =
are thus bereft to consider the clammy cells and the days of April: the =
days of yore when petrol pingle pangled out of Big Tree Cans until you =
fucked with various heads, fucker.=20

=20

But all this is much more than it is. In fact it is much more than more =
than what it is. Much much more you whore. All this being more: I being =
you and you seeking me and us as we seek you and indeed ever shall into =
endless edges. The great sea turns white. And why shouldnt it?  Nothing =
is. And yet the Thing playing about his frontage had sleight. Some sort =
of lusty legerdemain. Les Main Sales. They are. It all started with: =
"You dirty boy." The house leaked like a palindrome; but never =
completely as if a savage and incomprehensible music (nationality or =
race unknown or irrelevant) was and did deep-guide her quick hand, and =
the subject of gluttony shifted, till one, flicking back a strand of =
hair, scraped back her chair and vanished by virtue of defaulted =
surprise. We linguists. I, by the way, am that to be and verify.

I'd just like to say a few words in support of all my friends gathered in
Philadelphia for this year's MLA convention. Don't despair, friends! Do
your best to appear cheerful and knowledgeable! Remember how much
discouragement you've had to absorb along the way to where you are --a few
more days of it won't kill you! Sorry I can't be there as I am
celebrating the Christian High Holidays with my parents Brenda and
Charlie. But I hoping to make it next year, so I can share the crying jags
and exorbitant bar tabs with you all!

Love,
David

L asked:
..|  what do you mean by new in this context?


So for Alan, I think, this can only mean one thing: giving up his
project of self-aggrandizement.

I think if Alan became more aware of his whole environment, abandoning a
lifestyle of producing so many references pointing to 'him' (the 2+
daily posts we have suffered for over 8 years), he would become less
self-centered and experience more direct contact with the world.

Nonterritoriality is a direction Alan has never considered going, but, I
think, when you exist without matrices and ruts, nothing to work with,
no lines to follow; when there's nothing to hold on to, no 'projects',
no Calvin-like zeal, no personal gain (sans-capitalization); in short,
when you have no ulterior motives, no Amway-like pyramid to uphold and
maintain, then are you more open to potential, to the world, and things
become new to you.

And I'm not talking about a purge and polluting the world with a bunch
of leftovers. I'm talking about examining things and making use of them.
That's not a reformation -- it's renewal and discovery.

I don't believe discovery is possible until one stops to look: automata
do not sense themselves.

If that's the case (2+ daily posts), Alan really should get a blog.
Then he would never have to ask whether people want to read his stuff;
they would go and read it if they wanted to read it. And whether it is
two people a year or two thousand people a day, Alan would know
exactly who does (or doesn't) want to read his stuff.

So if the answer is 'no' to your original 'query' you don't want to hear it?
I remember reading, several years ago, a poet from around here named Dorothy
Livesay who said "poetry is like bread." 'Yes, Dorothy; but would you
believe that, nowadays, poetry is becoming a bit like spam and spam is
becoming a bit like poetry?' Normally I don't get email from spammers who
call those who don't read their spam idiots. There's one for the spleen
section of the spam record book.

By the way, in answer to another post, the CBC recommended
http://redcross.ca
http://unicef.ca
http://worldvision.ca
concerning donations to the tsunami aide effort.

New Thoughts


I am in the best form I have ever been in this very day.
I am in full contemporary command of my emotions and psychology.
My use of language has never been better than it is today.
I have full concentration to accomplish many things this day.
This day I am at my happiest I have ever been.
I understand difficult concepts and have a fantastic memory now.
Right this moment I am focused more than ever.
Language extends itself contemporaneously in my exciting styles.
Right now I love writing more than ever.
Today I am thinking more calmly than ever.
This perfect moment I am in full health and complete command.
I love working on these texts from day to day.
Here I am doing what I love best.
This day which is my happiest I am writing new and unheard-of thoughts.
Right now I have no stress and am at my calmest and most productive.
I feel best about myself and have good advice to offer anyone.
I am a good person and what I do turns out right and is appreciated now.
I am a fun person and am worthwhile to get to know.
Right now I am writing at the very top of forms.
My abilities are limitless and exciting today and have no bounds.
These are perfect times for being alive and everything I appreciate.
I love where I live and I love my partner and my work.
Our natural beauty in our home is lovely and growing now and continues.
I am more incisive and clear-headed than ever.
In this moment today I am fun and exciting to know.
My health could not be better than it is nowadays.
My days and nights are amazingly productive as in evidence this moment.
Right this moment I am intensely interested in everything about me.
I am an island of stability in the middle of wonderful chaos right now.
My sense of humor is perfected and I am a generous person.

I think the two posts a day is what Alan needs - this debate has occurred
several times - my original point was by way of a comment - I also commented
privately to Alan and also to Lawrence Upton and August and Ian van Heusen
and others (whose work I found interesting or challenging) I like to give
feedback myself - now Alan - if he was on a Blog  (that's well and good) but
his project (I feel) needs to be online and going out there even if one
person of a 100 looks at it and - yes - in a certain way it shouldn't matter
if there are no responses (+ve or -ve)  - BUT in another sense it does
matter - that is  he needs feedback as a professional poet - not as an
egotist - of course there is a bit of both - we all like to be
cknowledged  - that said, it, Alan's short "survey", was prompted (partly by
an enquiry/comment I sent Alan back channel) - its a good idea to get a kind
of survey of who is watching - but Alan - I always am aware that if (when I
used to give readings more) that if I got say one even out of ten or even
less interested I was doing ok - and it didn't have to be James Joyce or
Charles Professor von Bernstein I was impressing - of course one likes to
think that "famous " people like your (one's) work but ultimately it doesn't
matter (mostly they are only interested in promulgating their own heads -
which is the way things are - lets face it - its a fact - poets are
egotists - myself included - or we couldn't hardly write anything...) - it
is how one feels in one's own heart - drive on Alan;drive on - but we all
have times of doubt and dark of course -- I think what Alan is doing will be
looked with great interest and enthusiasm in time by intelligent writers and
critics  - that some don't look means often that they just don't have time
(and even if they think its no good  - well so be it - that's life Alan (and
others)) - g b I suspect if a great deleter - nothing wrong with that: and I
put stuff on myself and responses are very rare. One gets hardened to that.
It's a bit disconcerting but its the way things are.

It's good to see this project of Alan's - even if I haven't got my head
around it all - but it's good he is doing this - also I know he needs this
way of promulgating his work - its merits are unclear just now  perhaps -
but my instinct is that something extraordinary is occurring here - I feel
we should pay attention to what he is doing on here  - not wait till he is
dead...like MacLow etc

Once a poet is dead they are dead - let's give some attention to the
living - the langpos seem obsessed with a whole lot of dead white men!!

g b deletes but he never "hazards a poem"  (Johnson on Swift: "The rogue
never hazards a metaphor."

I'd forgotten I asked that; and now I wish that I hadn't, because you've
just used it as a reason to attack AS again.

I didn't ask *why you said what you said, that was clear enough, I feel, the
desire to say something against the man. (Had I doubts about his method, I'd
be inclined not to voice them where the focus is on the man and accusations
of his moral intent rather than the work because I don't want to feed the
animosity.)

I asked what you meant *by _new_, the word; and you haven't
really told me. I've heard all this before. I should have kept quiet and I
apologise to Alan.

One thing I can say about Alan Sondheim is that he is nearly always trying
to do something that is new. In my clumsy way that was what I was seeking to
emphasise, forgetting how inventive the urge to defame can be.

That his manner of distribution of what he makes is a _project of
self-aggrandizement_ is not a view I share; and is not only undemonstrated
by you but, as an unusual tendency, possibly undemonstrable - this isn't
exactly an arena for the humble, as your own post makes very clear.

I have never detected malice in Alan. Think about that. Try something new.

Yes - but I've been  to many - it was great to be able to read at the
Nuyorican - it gives one a buzz  - I read in the slam there in 1993 but
didnt do very well but some people thought I was something else - dont know
who they were - they called me "The Kiwi" !  (I suppose I WAS someone
else!)Great place the Lower East Side.

Readings!- for a moment -when one reads in public, one is something
(someone!!)(even if that something (someone) is something else!), one is
outputting, not just watching the Simpsons. Good or bad it fulfils a deep
need - in addition to music.  Everyone has a need to be heard at times (to
let the child in us out for a tumble).Open poetry readings are better than
bombing people.

there" - its not a good trip - but I used to drink a lot (mainly in social
situations) - very heavily at poetry readings -in fact it was the only way I
could get started - to get pissed before the reading.... and I had some
standing ovations even when I was drunk - the readings were great - - up to
about 5 pints then I degenerated - but dont want to 'go there' again - dont
reccommend it (better to read without if you can) -blackness accompanies
booze...especially the next day...

Have something called "Translations" (something like that) he, Jackson, is
talking in there about how he composed his "French Sonnets " by using a
French (Old French?) dictionary and for each word of say a Shakespearian
sonnet he would find a word in French - either at random or by the first
letter of the word - so a kind of chance operation "controlled " chance is
maybe best.....apart from that dont know much about J Mac. Seems he was a
good old stick - and if he was seeing hearing and feeling words and language
he was onto it!

The NY Times is like old copies of similar "mainstream" mags or reviews -
they are fascinating when read several years after the original date that

New Thoughts


I am in the best form I have ever been in this very day.
I am in full contemporary command of my emotions and psychology.
My use of language has never been better than it is today.
I have full concentration to accomplish many things this day.
This day I am at my happiest I have ever been.
I understand difficult concepts and have a fantastic memory now.
Right this moment I am focused more than ever.
Language extends itself contemporaneously in my exciting styles.
Right now I love writing more than ever.
Today I am thinking more calmly than ever.
This perfect moment I am in full health and complete command.
I love working on these texts from day to day.
Here I am doing what I love best.
This day which is my happiest I am writing new and unheard-of thoughts.
Right now I have no stress and am at my calmest and most productive.
I feel best about myself and have good advice to offer anyone.
I am a good person and what I do turns out right and is appreciated now.
I am a fun person and am worthwhile to get to know.
Right now I am writing at the very top of forms.
My abilities are limitless and exciting today and have no bounds.
These are perfect times for being alive and everything I appreciate.
I love where I live and I love my partner and my work.
Our natural beauty in our home is lovely and growing now and continues.
I am more incisive and clear-headed than ever.
In this moment today I am fun and exciting to know.
My health could not be better than it is nowadays.
My days and nights are amazingly productive as in evidence this moment.
Right this moment I am intensely interested in everything about me.
I am an island of stability in the middle of wonderful chaos right now.
My sense of humor is perfected and I am a generous person.

Hi All,

In anticipation of the publication of my first book, a translation of
selections from the 13th century Persian classic, Saadi's Gulistan, I have
created a website, www.richardjnewman.com, where you can get information
about me and my work. I am sending you this message to invite you to visit
richardjnewman.com. If you do, please let me know what you think.

"Selections from Saadi's Gulistan" will be the first in a series of five
translations I will be doing for Global Scholarly Publications (GSP) and the
International Society for Iranian Culture (ISIC), which will publish the
books as part of their Farsi Heritage Series. In addition to information
about my translations, you will find selections from my poems and essays, an
online copy of my CV, my blog, an ongoing project I call a "Self-Portrait in
Quotes" and more. As I said, I hope you will visit and let me know what you
think.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope you have a happy and a
healthy New Year.

Rich Newman

Alan, this piece seems so bitter. I am not sure what you want from a reader.
To me this comes off as a false gesture - mock bitter or real bitter. I feel
something like spit come into my mouth. I spit it out quickly.

There are - and you have given variously (obviously with the inconsistency
of any of us) much more interesting work.

Humbly,

Stephen V

Stephen,

Pardon my stepping in on this one. This may have been a "work," but I
perceived it as something different. Many years ago I wrote something like
this during a period when my feelings were exactly the opposite: a gesture
of (perhaps exaggerated) confidence to try to offset my own extreme
self-doubt. Alan appears to be experiencing a lot of doubt right now, and I
would guess, personal frustration, neither of which is uncommon in our
calling. I consider his statement an affirmation made by a person who
shouldn't need to make one, given his talents. I don't think it's a "work"
because it doesn't threaten to burst through the edge the way Alan's work
does. Consider it in the context of the dynamic involving Alan's questioning
his own work and the value of posting it on the list. Simply put, I think
Alan is going through a difficult time and is trying to make himself feel
better about his life. Every now and then we need to do something just to
get ourselves through the night, so to speak. This strikes me as one of
those efforts. I think he needs kindness right now, not criticism of this
piece. I hope you understand where I'm coming from.

Best,

Vernon

Hi,

Your website is being censored in Ga public libraries...

Here's what comes up when a Ga public library patron attempts to
visit
http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj :

Forbidden, this page (
http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column2.html ) is categorized
as:
Sex.

This censorware is called (irony alert) "Smartfilter" and the company
that sells is called "Secure Computing".

http://www.securecomputing.com/

Sucks, eh?

J

No, just not smart but dumb. There is no sex in
http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column2.html . Just drugs and
rock and roll.

Best, Al Aronowitz

I think Doctors without Borders does a very good job, Alan.

www.doctorswithoutborders.org

They have lots of activity on their website, but they have a siimple
page with reportage of what they are doing in the afflicted areas.
That's where Laura and I plan to donate.

I did.

At least that's one aspect of what it is.


But I too have been guilty at times of jeopardizing
this aspect of the list in order to strut by like an
asshole. Perhaps you'll do better next time.

It doesn't take much to be a caustic dink and in my
experience the  pleasure gained thereby is paltry.
I've never done myself well by doing doing others
poorly.


As for the piece itself, I think it’s a complex one:
by hairpin turns  --  fine turns as if on the ledge a
single eyelash, turns so sharp the thing is a pretzel

Subject:      SUBTEXT Seattle Reading Series - Matlin/Rowan
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
David MATLIN & Lou ROWAN at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, January 5,
2005.
Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of the
performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

DAVID MATLIN is a novelist, poet, and essayist. His collections of poetry
and
prose include the books _China Beach_, _Dressed In Protective Fashion_, and
_Fontana's Mirror_. His first novel _How the Night is Divided_ (McPherson &

International, Poetry New York, and FLASHPOINT.

His book length essay _Vernooykill Creek: The Crisis of Prisons in America_
(San
Diego State Univ Press, 1997) is based on ten years of teaching in one of
the
oldest Prison Education Programs in the nation in New York State. This essay
discusses the crisis of prisons, the invention of surplus populations, and
how
America has been mining its own civil disintegrations for at least two
decades.
The book was widely reviewed and continues to receive strong critical
acclaim. A
new publication of the book with a more extensive introduction is
forthcoming
from North Atlantic Books.

From 1986 through 1989, Matlin was the Curator of Poetry and Literature at

LOU ROWAN currently writes fiction and essays. He's at work on a novel about
the
losing of the American West, and he has completed a book of short stories,
_Except My Life_, a satirical novel narrated by a superhero, and a
collection of
poems. His fiction currently appears in Prague Literary Review, and his
stories,
essays and poetry have appeared in a wide variety of journals. He began
writing
in New York City, and participated in many of the literary experiments
around
St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery. He has earned his living as a businessman
and
as an educator, and now edits Golden Handcuffs Review and works in
residential
real estate in Seattle.

Toothless Tiger





There is a new animal that is patrolling the halls of our nation.

Irretrievable would be the fear this beast once wrought on our =
corporations.

Ronnie Ray-Gun started the beast in a downward spiraling motion.

When he screwed the air traffic controllers from behind, without the use =
of lotion.



The once great cat has been declawed.



This action should have caused an outcry big enough to rock every =
foundation.

But greed and corruption were taking over, and kept a tight lid on the =
situation.

Benefits and bonuses that at one time came to be expected,

Were now management's tools to beat the workers into subjection.



The once great cat sleeps quietly in the corner.



As our jobs get shipped abroad, while politicians do absolutely nothing.

The powerless unions could no longer protect us from just this sort of =
thing.

I believe it's to late to save the beast, that many gave their lives =
for.

The neutered tiger standing numbly by, has just become an eyesore.



The once great cat slips off to extinction.

Alan has every right to post as much as he wants to any list anywhere.
We also have the right to be bored by just about anything he posts.
What's new about any of this?  Nothing.  Alan is not going to stop
posting, although--by jing--it looks like he has taken to posting links
instead of epics (thanks Alan!), and we're not going to stop being
bored, unless Alan creates something totally un-Alan-like.  I'd call
that a Mexican stand-off. The big news is that absolutely none of this
matters.  I'd much rather be bored by Alan in the safety of my own
home, than swept away by the Tsunami that has probably drowned at least
two of my students and one of my associates, so I guess it's all in the
way you look at it.  I'm still wondering when the Big One is coming to
Tokyo, but in the meantime, Alan, feel free.  The Ages are looking on.

I recently posted this to another list, but no one responded, so I'll post
it here.

I have been reading _Oliver Twist_ and wondering, along the way, about the
characterization of Fagin, who is most often referred to as "the Jew": isn't
he a bit of a stereotype, with the filching, the hording, the crooked nose,
etc?  There is a similar character in _The Great Gatsby_, if you'll recall,
named Meyer Wolfsheim. Wolfsheim is a racketeer who has helped Gatsby create
an illegal fortune and then is too selfish even to attend his funeral at the
end. Anyway, I just got to the following passage in Dickens, and I'm
wondering, why does T. S. Eliot always get hell for his Phonecian sailor
when there is so much obvious anti-semitism in literature from this period?
Where else does Eliot portray Jews negatively?

Aaron


+ + + + + + +

It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat
tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so
as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den.
He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and
having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating
footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he
could.

The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighbourhood of
Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street;
and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the
direction of Spitalfields.

The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets;
the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the
touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to
be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of
the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome
reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved:
crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.

        "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar"

eg:

      But this or such was Bleistein's way:
        A saggy bending of the knees
      And elbows, with the palms turned out,
        Chicago Semite Viennese.

Nineteenth and early 20thC British writing (not to go back to Marlowe and
Shakespeare, leave alone Chaucer's Abbess's Tale) is riddled with
antisemitism.

The one exception that I can think of is (George) Eliot's _Daniel Deronda_.

Disraeli, I suppose too, but I don't know his novels.  And he was passing.

Trollope, from this period, is I think more sympathetic to Jews than is
Dickens, but I've had that thrown back in my face.

To me, the wierdest case is Edgar Wallace's Sanders novels, which on the
face of it are [obviously] racist, but in an odd way are even worse for the
*covert* antisemitism.

Fagin is a cliché -- there are worse things around from that period.

RH.

(Incidentally, Phlebas was a Phoenician, which while it makes him semitic,
puts him in a racial class not simply with Jews but almost anyone who lived
in the Middle East.

R again.)

Hey, there's Malamud's short story, "The Jew-Bird" -- *that*s the way to do
it, wind the bastards up.

Yes and check out Edgar Rosenberg, From Shylock to Svengali, Jewish

Alan - thanks for the reference.

Robin - I had forgotten about Eliot's Bleistein, but i think there's a big
difference between the stanza you quote and Dickens' portrayal of Fagin:
theiving, miserly, and compared to a lizard!   It's the animal comparison
that sends off the loudest alarm for me.

I am not saying there isn't a touch of anti-semitism in Eliot's poetry, but
just to say that it seems a lot more palatable than what's in Dickens, and
you never hear people screaming about Dickens.  Perhaps it's Eliot's
connection to Pound that gets him in trouble.

It makes me terribly angry that there is so much anti-semitism in such a
rich body of literature.   It's like a beautiful athlete with cancer or
something!

Oddly, Fagin doesn't bother me that much -- it's simply such a raving
nonsense cartoon that it's impossible to take seriously.

But there's something seriously wrong about *all* of Eliot's rhymed
octosyllabic quatrain poems from that period -- Sweeney Among the
Nightingales, mate?

people won't be lost to corruption.  -  It came just like a river.

be ... such devastation.  -  Children in emergency wards were killed.
Soldier patients suffering from malaria helped to evacuate other
patients.  -  I need baby food as well ... no aid has come to us yet.
-  No contact makes us fearful. We're trying to send helicopters there.
  -  Where is the military? They're just taking care of their families.
There is no war in Aceh now, why don't they help pick up the bodies in
the street?

This was the only thing we could do. It was a desperate solution. The
bodies were rotting. We gave them a decent burial.  -  Police told us
to come and have a look at this collection of ID cards.  -  We met in
university. Is this the fate that we hoped for? My darling, you were
the only hope for me.

Dead: they are dead, my cousins, their children, many of my husband's
family. There are too many funerals, he has to stay to help them.  -
She went under a car, it just went over the top of her. I just got
picked up and chucked against a wall. I was a lucky one: we cheated
death.  -  Then all of a sudden we saw what looked like a wave surge
into the garden ... at one point I had to scramble up bamboo trees to
avoid the rising water.

I hope and pray that we can at least find their bodies so that we can
see them one last time and give them a decent burial.  -  Information
reaching here suggests facilities at Kalpakkam nuclear station may have
been affected by the tidal waves.  -  We don't have confirmed data =8A  -
  The TV, everything gone.  -  I've got calls from people down south who
need clothes to bury their dead. They have none.

This is tricky territory, one HAS to have the mind of a cultural historian of the first rank to even begin to discuss it, which I
quite freely confess I do not have. But let's make an attempt. The term 'anti-semitism' would have been meaningless to Elizabethans
like Marlowe or Shakespeare, that Marlowe's 'Jew of Malta' relies on a stereotype, which was quite typical of European culture for
centuries, and Islamic culture too, where Jews were those allowed to raise interest, unlike the supposedly pure Christians or
Moslems, who happily indulged in the slave trade, Moslems first, then Christians, after a hiatus, with the assistance of African
chiefs. Marlowe and Shakespeare knew next to nothing about Jews, but Shakespeare characteristically turned the simple equations on
their head by giving the greatest speech in the play to the devilish Shylock, 'The Merchant of Venice', as Kenneth Tynan said, is a
broken-backed play, the messages it gives out are ambiguous, does WS really side with the Merchants who are as rapacious as Shylock
or does he side with a man who was as so concerned with daughters as WS seemed to be himself? Well, of course, in typical WS style,
he ain't telling you. The play's the thing.
Dickens cardboard cut-out Fagin is of course a piece of Victorian stage villainy, altho' Ron Moody's immortal performance in the
musical goes way beyond that , but would anyone be mad enough to suggest that Dickens' characterisation of Bill Sykes was prejudiced
against the English? I am sick of stereotypes being thrown against stereotypes, and historically unaware statements being brandished
like rusty swords. One has to be aware of the modes of communication and understanding between the cultures of the past - it's not
that we now are any better, we're probably worse, and by we I mean right across the developed world, from the US right through to
Japan via France etc. The people of the further past had even less idea of other cultures than we do, and the limits of 'our'  ideas
are shown with horrible vividness by the bungling by the US-led coalition in occupied Iraq. The bit that is nasty is the deliberate
anti-semitism that is so evident in the modernist hero Pound, I'll never forget his comments about Isaac Rosenberg in an letter they
are unrepeatable, , and in an icier, colder, more heartless way, in the more limited but greater poet Eliot. They knew better.
Racism is everywhere, Jamaicans and Barbadians are prejudiced against each other, in a general sense, I don't mean every individual
feels like that, China and India are full of ethnic discrimination, even talking about this is just touching the tip of what waited
for the Titanic, none of us have the right to assume moral superiority, I damn well know I don't. Cheap thrills to make one feel
somehow better.

Alan - thanks for the reference.

Robin - I had forgotten about Eliot's Bleistein, but i think there's a big
difference between the stanza you quote and Dickens' portrayal of Fagin:
theiving, miserly, and compared to a lizard!   It's the animal comparison
that sends off the loudest alarm for me.

I am not saying there isn't a touch of anti-semitism in Eliot's poetry, but
just to say that it seems a lot more palatable than what's in Dickens, and
you never hear people screaming about Dickens.  Perhaps it's Eliot's
connection to Pound that gets him in trouble.

It makes me terribly angry that there is so much anti-semitism in such a
rich body of literature.   It's like a beautiful athlete with cancer or
something!

In that wonderful speech Shylock in making his claim to humanity catalogues
what were considered the baser human attributes. No mention of the soul or
the "higher" emotions attached to it. This is entirely in keeping with the
standard stereotype. My guess is that the audience, with no more knowledge
of actual Jews than Shakespeare (altho there was a small community of
foreign Jewish merchants in London) would have responded, "yeah, that's
what Jews are like," and Shakespeare asks for that response by having
Portia remind them that "The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth
as the gentle rain from heaven." Like grace, to which the Jew is immune.

Disreali was Jewish - but Eliot also has "The Jew squats in his estaminet".
Fagin couldn't be done again - but Dickens is still a great writer - Dickens
probably met such types .... the East End of London still has  a certain
number of Jewish gangsters (of course  not all gangsters in the East end are
Jewish!!) - but theother day in thelocal some old pommy bloke was raving
about Isreal and how all the big busineses were run by Jews - he was some
old working class character)....but Eliot and all those guys were anti
semitic we have to make sure we avoid it in future.  Now I come across
people who are both anti semitic and rave against Arabs - not literary
people as far as I know though...we have to try to be more enlightened  I
suppose.

But we dnt want to get to PC about it all - there will probably always be
racists and nutters around in this mad world.

What about writers who wrote against anti-semitism etc?

Why not obsess about the fact that the USA was founded with a profound Anti
Catholic and Anti Immigrant bias?

Or the fact that 30 million people died in the African slave trade?

or that 50 million native Americans died when the Europeans arrived?

Or any number of the hundreds of racisms, sexism, homophobisms that exist
around the world?

How about the fact that the early Feminists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
Abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison and Ralph Waldo Emerson thought
the Irish were subhuman?

I think WOP stereotypes would would great and as a WOP I give my permission,
and if you want to use the words DAGO, or MOBSTER or GUINEA fine with this
WOP.

The fact that 100 years after the Italians arrived in the USA and after we
produced Frank Stella, Joseph Ceravolo, Enrico Fermi,Diane Di Prima, Lee
Iacocca and Joe DiMaggio, and many other great and good people all we hear
about in the popular Media is that we are MAFIA and that any Italian
American who has made must "have a friend with a cut nose", go right ahead.
Just think about this for a moment what if the Sopranos was a show about
Jewish Moneylenders do you think that show would win EMMYs?

No there would be riots

Most people are sensitive to the oppression that has been foisted on the
Jews it was always wrong
we are all against this evil-

- ENOUGH OVERSENSITIVITY WE ALL HAVE STORIES OF OPPRESSION AND BIGOTRY AND
NO ONE ON THE BUFFALO LIST CONDONES OR ENDORSES THESE THINGS WE WOULD HOPE

No one here is denigrating the Holocaust and if there is an Anti Semite on
the list shame on you for being stupid and ignorant-

You know we have a role as poets in this society of ours and that is to
oppose the Fascist state that is developing in our nation right now where
are our poets-where is our Akhmatova? our Neruda? our Thomas Mann?

We all, especially on this list, need to be wary of those who treat
racial accusations as guilty until proven innocent, actively seek-out
such accusations, and treat multiple accusations as proof of guilt.
These people seek to rule by terror and behave in a predatory manner.

We all need to clear the cobwebs out of our heads and realize that every
racially-conscious group or person is up-to-no-good.

Raymond-  You are surely missing my point. I'm not trying to get PC on your
wop ass.

I was just wondering: if Dickens had a pronounced anti-Jewish
predisposition, why do we bother so much about folks like Eliot? Robin's
answer was spot on.  There's more to Eliot than I had remembered, especially
in the Sweeney set. The "murderous paws," etc. "Apeneck Sweeney."    Yikes.

Case closed.

Chicago Postmodern Poetry --- hmm....   Will you come see me read at Myopic

    The conversation among writers that takes place in the last 20 years
    is for the most part just like the conversation of any other
    professional people on the make. They could just as well be
    advertising executives or businesspeople, or anything else. They
    talk about income and they talk about the comforts or lack of
    comforts of their personal lives, and -- but that's a kind of -- if
    I think back on my own life, the single most amazing phenomenon is
    the discrediting of idealism.

Hi Mark


Although I'm not sure whether the Shylock speech alludes to the 'baser human attributes' I do agree with you that WS and his
audience would not have known much about Jews, however, one does have to add a proviso that London, unlike the rest of England, had
long been host to immigrant communities, one of the lesser known aspects of the Peasants Revolt was that it was triggered in Kent by
the believed economic power of Flemings in London. These things get muckier the more one looks into them. One of the, forensically,
as it were, aspects of the MOV, is its projection of characteristics that would have been well known to WS & audience onto Shylock
that really belonged to the gentleman proto-capitalists of the London 'Change. They were the ones who really wanted a pound of
flesh. I'm very wary of saying anything about WS himself might have felt, the phrase was the thing I reckon as far he was concerned,
he wrote to please whoever he was writing for, I'd tentatively suggest a certain sensitivity about daughters and an unease about
crowds turning into mobs. Significant facts about WS tend include what didn't happen, for instance, the use of a revival of RII as a
signal for the failed Essex rebellion is indisputable, most of players were hauled before the authorities, and treated very badly,
while Essex was beheaded and Southampton was thrown in gaol, but who was questioned, hassled, interrogated at all? Why, none other
than Ws, the author of the play. He was an evasive touch-me-not so-and-so whatever else he was.

All the Best

In that wonderful speech Shylock in making his claim to humanity catalogues
what were considered the baser human attributes. No mention of the soul or
the "higher" emotions attached to it. This is entirely in keeping with the
standard stereotype. My guess is that the audience, with no more knowledge
of actual Jews than Shakespeare (altho there was a small community of
foreign Jewish merchants in London) would have responded, "yeah, that's
what Jews are like," and Shakespeare asks for that response by having
Portia remind them that "The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth
as the gentle rain from heaven." Like grace, to which the Jew is immune.

Steve,

As a Scottish-American, I must take exception to your inaccurate
stereotyping. We are not "almost as cheap as," etc. WE ARE CHEAPER!
Everybody needs something to feel proud about. Your post disturbed me so
greatly that instead of writing I'm going to spend my morning counting the
pennies under my mattress.

The question of why we treat different writers differently when it comes to
how we respond to the less-than-savory values they hold, i.e., the original
question raised by Aaron Belz, is a good one and it applies to writers other
than poets and to other genres as well. I have, for example, been reading
the Harry Potter series to my son and I am continually struck by the obvious
and conventional and male dominant gender stereotypes woven through the
narrative--everything from Hermione Granger's
goody-two-shoes-good-student-ness (and yes I am aware that she is more
complex than that; I would, however, argue that overall she fits a very
clear and obvious female/feminine stereotype) to the Weasley's marriage--and
I have wondered if, amidst all the gushing about the series and how
wonderful its influence on kids' reading habits has been, anyone has
bothered to point out that it also reinforces ideas about masculinity and
femininity and what it means for us to be men and women that are blatantly
sexist.

Perhaps they have and I just haven't read it, but my point is that all the
writing we do is infused with the values of the time and place we live in
and to ask questions about that, and about our critical responses, personal
and institutional, to those values and how they are expressed in writing, is
not, by definition, to obsess about them. It is to try to be responsible and
accountable for and to the world(s) that words create, as well as the world
those words come out of. And we all have blind spots precisely because we
all have identities that are shaped by the specifics of who we are, where
and when we have lived, whom we have known and so on, specific which will,
by definition, have excluded whole areas of human experience from our fields
of vision. To be conscious of those identities in reading and writing, as
well as the identities of those who write what we read, is one of the ways
of broadening what we know about the world and ourselves.

It is worth asking, for example, why when T. S. Eliot is taught to
undergraduates in introductory literature classes, and perhaps even in
courses in modern poetry meant for English majors, his anti-Semitism tends
to be rendered invisible--and I should add that it was rendered invisible
when I was a graduate student as well. And it's worth asking this not to
denigrate T. S. Eliot, or to say that he was less of a poet than he was, or
even to accuse those who do not mention T. S. Eliot's anti-Semitism of being
anti-Semitic themselves. It is worth asking because if we really believe
that writing matters, that it is of value in the world, that it is political
in broadest possible sense of that term, then we also have to admit that the
choices we make in terms of what we read and teach to whom, where, when and
why are also political and bespeak the values of the moment no less strongly
than the writers we are teaching. (And I would add that the same point could
and should be made about all isms, not just anti-Semitism; I've focused on
that only because it's where this discussion started.)

To refuse the validity of this kind of inquiry is to condemn ourselves to
what I can only characterize as a "nice white liberal color blindness" that
in fact masks the underlying privilege of the dominant group in this
culture, which is overwhelming white and Christian--precisely because it is
to suggest that this kind of color blindness is not at one and the same time
a kind of race consciousness in itself. (There is a wonderful book that
deals with this question in much larger and more complex terms than I can
possible do here: White, by Richard Dyer.)

We all need to be honest with ourselves about the isms we cannot help but
harbor. Being married to an Iranian Muslim has, over the years, opened my
eyes to all kinds of misconceptions I didn't know I had that are deeply
rooted in the anti-Arab racism of the west, and learning about these has
changed the way I read and the kinds of questions I ask about what I read.
And I could tell story after story about the same thing happening to me at
different points in my life. I wish people on this list were willing to be a
little more vulnerable about issues like this, and more honest. It would,
for me, raise the level of discussion in the dialogues that cycle through
the list every so often about an aspect of making literature that we, or at
least I believe that we, cannot escape.

And I wish you all a happy and healthy New Year!

Richard

This is one reason why publishing on your own web site, and not as a book,
is so worthwhile. Unlike with a book, I'm able to correct and revise my
texts even after they've been initially announced and read. Here a text is
in a continuous process of revision, which makes it a body of work that's
always alive and kicking. This is not to say that books aren't important.
I'm forever reading books. But for the writer, publishing on paper has a
finality that could be deadly.

curious.  in this obsession in ferretting out anti-semitism in Shakespeare/Dickens/Eliot, which is either moot or a subject you can debate until the cows come home, take up knitting and have hot toddies, there is no acknowledgement of anti-arabism that exists in the same texts.  or rather, anti-semitism, since the distinction is not genetic, but linguistic (semitic languages, including Arabic and Hebrew).  do you really believe that medieval peasants could distinguish between one inconoclastic mideastern monotheism from the other, particularly when the dietary rules were so similar, the attitudes towards scholarship, and other signifiers of that nothingness, race.  yet the delusion persists.  Othello is always thought of a black, i.e. of African origin, in common thought, but he is of course a Moor and is Muslim and probably of Arabic descent.

finally, Shakespeare always deals from both sides of the deck, and therefore is relatively free of responsibility.  it is Dickens and Eliot, esp., who are blamable, and who should have known better.  for chrissakes, the best prime minister of the 19th century was of Jewish descent, and his father came up with evolution without doing the leg work.  (and waged propaganda for the Tories in the 1790s, too, but nobody is perfect).

I'm not sure what you're advocating. That one ignore the entire issue?
Perhaps easier for a non-Jew to say.

But it's of course not a question of ferretting out. One would have to be
willfully blind not to see the tradition of antisemitism at work in English
and American culture and European culture generally and in the literature
they produced.

As to the supposed confusion of muslims and jews, hogwash. Read some
history. It wasn't confused peasants who expelled Jews from England, and it
wasn't peasants who preached the pogrom that began the first crusade, any
more than it was peasants who destroyed the Albigensians. In countries that
did have moslem populations, like Spain, there also seems to have been no
confusion: Jews and Moslems were treated terribly, but differently. Moslems
were infidels, but they hadn't killed Christ. Jews were expelled or forced
to convert in 1492. A separate set of laws forced the same choice on
Muslims in various parts of Spain between 1502 and 1526.

Disraeli wasn't of Jewish descent. Until his pro forma (and legally
necessary) conversion he was Jewish.

Your little joke by the way is in bad taste in too many ways to unpack.
Maybe you're unaware that "new york jew" continues to be an epithet in this
country, and not just in Spicer.

Robert,

On the light side of this discussion, several people I knew formed the
Scottish Power movement in a bar in Palo Alto in 1968. I forget what number
pitcher we were on when one of the group declared that we were "one of the
lost tribes of Israel." In my condo complex, whose population includes many
Jewish people from the Bronx, I haven't detected anything resembling the
brogue. As soon as I hear somebody bellow "Aye, laddie!" I'll be sure to let
you know.

Allen's break down/in of "tsunami" connects with an experience this morning
on my blog where indeed I have a poem entitled "Tsunami/ A Poem" that thoug=
h
it is an attempt, successful or not, to deal with the consequences of the
dead in this disaster, I purposely named the poem "Tsunami/ A Poem", knowin=
g
that it would register as such in the land of search engines and it would b=
e
curious to see how many visits (4 so far) that these engines would bring my
way (instead of my usual list of poet familiars), and indeed, when I
followed the search engines back, I found a list of other Tsunami poems, al=
l
of which had been written before the event (in fact a book of poems exists
with that name), and, in all the cases in which I looked a little further,
"Tsunami" was most frequently used, as 'one might imagine', as a metaphor
for some turbulent romantic relationship, or metaphor for some other x, y &
z, and it was kind of weird - in light of all this incredible death and
destruction from "a real tsunami" to see the way in which a kind of poetry
of metaphor may become so detached from actual natural facts (not to say
that couples, for example, don=B9t have real turbulent relationships from
which some die) but in the light of "the real" it was kind of embarrassing,
or sometimes, as it is, even embarrassing to tell anyone in general that yo=
u
are poet because they may well be thinking that what you write is filled
with some kind of dreamy-assed metaphors to which they may be attracted, or
have embraced "as poetry", a metaphor such as a "tsunami" with no coherence
whatsoever with the object or event to which it is seemingly or "poetically=
"
yoked.   Just the facts, m'am.

A fair enough point, given what I understand the history of the term
anti-Semitism to be, and it is worth thinking about what it means to apply a
term like anti-Semitism, which I think was coined in the 19th century
(though I could be wrong), retroactively by at least several centuries. And
it is worth, as well, thinking about how we use that term now that anti-Arab
racism is emerging more and more virulently and violently. Most of the Jews
in the US, after all, are ethnically not Semitic, while Arabs, pretty much
by definition, are. (I know that there is evidence that Jews from just about
anywhere in Europe have more genetically in common with, say, an Arab Iraqi
than their non-Jewish European counterparts, but a genetic identity is not
the same thing as an ethnic one.) For me, when talking about ideas about
Jews before the 19th century, it is much more accurate and descriptive to
use the expression Jew-hatred, and I am coming to think, though I am not yet
entirely convinced, that I like the term a whole lot better than
anti-Semitism in general. At the very least, the expression Jew-hatred makes
it harder to use Robert's linguistic question/assertion to do this to get
around having to confront the phenomenon of Jew-hatred on its own
terms--and, Robert, just to be clear about this, because I don't want to get
into an argument here, I am not suggesting you made the point about language
in order to avoid anything. I am merely pointing out that the point you made
is one that people do in fact use to avoid having to deal with Jew-hating,
whether their own or someone else's.

Almost all of language is "etymologically challenged," which is why we
generally follow customary meanings.

Western European Rom would be surprised in the extreme to learn that they
are muslems, who north of the Iberian peninsula were virtually non-existent
by the 10th century except for diplomats and the occasional exotic visitor
or castaway sailor. Which doesn't mean that they ceased to play a role in
the popular imagination. But imaginary muslims were rarely burned at the
stake. Jews weren't so lucky.

There are lots of reasons to fear for the world. Until those reasons pass
away you might instead fear being misunderstood as a racist. I know
something about this: when I first visited my inlaws in North Carolina I
made a few joking references to hillbillies. In my world the term is
harmless, just fun, not at all like trailer-trash. Not so in theirs, as
they were quick to inform me, despite their middle-to-upper class
credentials. It would be foolish of me to argue for the term with those who
experience it as a slap in the face. I'd suggest the same to you.

The peasantry in Andalusia spoke each other's languages. They knew which
language to use according to the ethnicity of the people they spoke to. But
attendance at mosques vs synagogues, and the use of prayer rugs, and myriad
other identifying traits would have told them who was who. This is not a
matter of my belief, it's fact, whether you have faith in it or not. I'd
suggest you test your faith by doing some reading. Remember, these people
lived in very close proximity. The same, by the way, was true in Poland and
the rest of the pale of settlement--Christians knew that the guys across
the street or down the road were Jews and not Muslims. If the various
ethnicities look alike to you I'd be concerned.

Said is taken seriously as a historian primarily by literary types. Most
historians think he distorts for polemic purposes.

I wasn't aware that the discussion was about who was more bigotted. Perhaps
I missed that.

One reason Dickens maybe gets more slack is he was writing a hundred years
earlier than Eliot. Oliver Twist was first published in 1837, Eliot was
writing/publishing in the 1930s. A hundred years is a long time. Consider
the difference in commmonly held views of African Americans by European
Americans in a hundred years, say 1880 to 1980. Racism of every stripe gets
less defensible the farther on in time we go. Also, I think some of Eliot's
reputation as an anti-semite is from biographical material as well as the
writing, testimony from those who knew him.

Mark: are you saying that anti-Semitism is essentially different from other
kinds of racism?

The first European progroms, in I think 12thC France (?), were against both
Jews and lepers.  Both were blamed for the Plague, and similar libels and
murderous actions were taken against both.  The issue there was scapegoating
identifiably other communities.  I'm not saying there are not distinctive
histories of bigotry, but all these social bigotries and exclusions
continuously seem to have similar attributes, up to the present day.

Hi Rich

I've looked up my source, so can be a little more specific.  In his book
Ecstasies, a tracing of the witches Sabbath, Carlo Ginsburg has a most
interesting chapter on Lepers, Muslims and Jews, and the  progroms in 1321
France.  The libel used against the lepers was that these people, "diseased
in body and soul", were conspiring to poison water supplies to spread their
sickness through the community.  As a result, lepers were arrested and
burned, or populations boarded them in their houses and burned the houses
down, and sweeping laws were approved by Phillip V for their segregation an=
d
confinement in ghettos and prisons.  Ginsburg says: "This was the first tim=
e
in the history of Europe that such a huge program of segregation was
undertaken.  In succeeding centuries other protagonists would take the
lepers' places: the mad, the poor, criminals and Jews.  But the lepers led
the way."

Jews were quickly added to this conspiracy through confessions from lepers
that Jews had corrupted them with money and given poison to scatter in
various wells.  The ingredients, significantly, were human blood, urine,
three herbs and a consecrated host.  Consequently Jews were massacred.  But
it seemed, in this particular conspiracy, the Jews were instigated by the
Muslim King of Granada, who was in turn inspired by Satan.

The accounts of this conspiracy are intricate and contradictory, but links
are constantly made between Jews, lepers and Muslims.  Jews were blamed for
bringing the Plague to Europe by poisoning water supplies.  Beggars and
paupers and witches were also accused of the same crime.

The blood libel - the killing of children for religious rituals - was used
against Christians in the first and second centuries by Romans as a reason
to persecute Christians (a misunderstanding of the Eucharist). In the
Mandean scripture, Christians are accused of killing Jewish babies.  In the
first century, Jews were supposed to kill Muslim and Christian babies to
make passover matzohs, which has been a durable libel through the centuries=
.
The blood libel turns up famously in Norwich in 1144, when it was used
against Jews. It was also one of the major accusations against witches,
Knights Templar, Cathars, wiccans, heretics, Roma, neopagans, Druids and
even Protestant missionaries.  And so on.  It's by no means an exclusively
Jewish libel. =20

There were numerous pogroms in western Europe specifically targeting Jews=20
throughout the 11th century, climaxing in the wholesale slaughter in the=20
Rhineland at the outset of the first crusade, in 1096. No lepers were=20
involved, and no muslims within Europe (tho plenty were slaughtered, along=
=20
with Jews and Eastern Christians, after Jerusalem was taken). It's at this=
=20
period that expulsions and ghettoization begin. Note that when the Jews=20
were expelled from England and briefly from France in the 12th century=20
there was nary a mention of muslims or lepers.

I'm not claiming that antisemitism is different, tho as Rich points out it=
=20
was in some ways (no Muslims were ever killed for allegedly mistreating the=
=20
sacramental wafer, for instance) but that it's a separate phenomenon=20
through most of its history in Europe, even tho it sometimes comes into=20
play as part of a larger hysteria.

This is not to claim any special virtue--there are slaughters enough to go=
=20
around. But it has been a pervasive blight in Europe.

Ginsburg apparently doesn't think that mass expulsions count as=20
separations. Ghettoization of Jews begins somewhat later, although it was=20
mandated by the church in 1179.

The blood libel isn't exclusively applied to Jews, just in an overwhelming=
=20
majority of cases. What's your point?

Mark

A Sri Lankan student of mine named T.V. Cruz and his Chinese lover
informed me that they would be spending the Christmas holidays at Mr.
Cruz's family home.  In addition, Bob Baxter, his Japanese wife, and
their wonderful seven year old son did this year what they do every
year--go to one of the smaller Thai islands, rent a bungalo right on the
beach, and celebrate the holidays.  Bob is an American residing in
Japan.  I doubt if the Sri Lankan or Chinese lists would be available to
anyone reading this.  So far the Japanese government is not releasing
any names.  If anyone does come across these names please let me know
back-channel.  Thanks, Jesse

You might even find some insensitive remarks in 19th Century

My point is that the patterns of bigotry against minority communities -
lepers, Roma, heretics - contain similar patterns.  It seems to me that that
it might be more profitable to examine phenomena like anti-Semitism by
looking at in a larger context, rather than in isolation as as a bigotry
that only happens to Jews.  It's very often said that the Blood Libel only
applies to Jews, and that's incorrect.  It's not even an exclusively
Christian lie.  That's why I asked whether you were saying anti-Semitism was
essentially different from other kinds of racism.

Thanks for the correction, Pierre.  It's too hot here for my brain to work

Damn.  Let down by my syntax yet again.  Of course anti-Semitism is about
Jew Hatred, as Richard (?) succintly put it.  But anti-Semitism is one
manifestation of larger social pathologies, which have identifiable
similarities. =20

Anyway, a connected if sideways thing - I read this today and it made me
feel ill.

Why the Japanese internment still matters

By Daniel Pipes=20

Middle East Forum=20


For years, it has been my position that the threat of radical Islam implies
an imperative to focus security measures on Muslims. If searching for
rapists, one looks only at the male population. Similarly, if searching for
Islamists (adherents of radical Islam), one looks at the Muslim population.

And so, I was encouraged by a just-released Cornell University opinion
survey that finds nearly half the U.S. population agreeing with this
proposition.=20

Specifically, 44 percent of Americans believe that government authorities
should direct special attention toward Muslims living in the United States,
either by registering their whereabouts, profiling them, monitoring their
mosques or infiltrating their organizations.

That's the good news; the bad news is the near-universal disapproval of thi=
s
realism. Leftist and Islamist organizations have so successfully influenced
public opinion that polite society shies away from endorsing a focus on
Muslims.=20

In the United States, this intimidation results in large part from a
revisionist interpretation of the evacuation, relocation and internment of
ethnic Japanese during World War II.

Denying that the treatment of ethnic Japanese resulted from legitimate
national security concerns, this lobby has established that it resulted
solely from a combination of "wartime hysteria" and "racial prejudice."

As radical groups like the American Civil Liberties Union wield this
interpretation, in the words of columnist Michelle Malkin, "like a bludgeon
over the War on Terror debate," they pre-empt efforts to build an effective
defense against today's Islamist enemy.

The intrepid Malkin, a specialist on immigration, has re-opened the
internment file.=20

Her recently published book, bearing the provocative title In Defense of
Internment: The Case for Racial Profiling in World War II and the War on
Terror (Regnery), starts with the unarguable premise that in time of war,
"the survival of the nation comes first." From there, she draws the
corollary that "Civil liberties are not sacrosanct."

She then reviews the historical record of the early 1940s and finds that:

=80=A0 Within hours of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, two U.S. citizens of
Japanese ancestry, with no history of anti-Americanism, shockingly
collaborated with a Japanese soldier against their fellow Hawaiians.

=80=A0 The Japanese government had established "an extensive espionage network
within the United States" believed to include hundreds of agents.

=80=A0 In contrast to loose talk about "American concentration camps," the
relocation camps for Japanese were "Spartan facilities that were for the
most part administered humanely." As proof, she notes that more than 200
individuals voluntarily chose to move into the camps.

=80=A0 The relocation process itself won praise from Carey McWilliams, a
contemporary leftist critic (and future editor of The Nation ), for taking
place "without a hitch."

=80=A0 A federal panel that reviewed these issues in 1981-83, the Commission on
Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, was, Malkin explains,
"Stacked with left-leaning lawyers, politicians, and civil rights activists
-- but not a single military officer or intelligence expert."

=80=A0 The apology for internment by Ronald Reagan in 1988, plus the nearly
$1.65 billion in reparations paid to former internees, was premised on
faulty scholarship. In particular, it largely ignored the top-secret
decoding of Japanese diplomatic traffic, codenamed the MAGIC messages, whic=
h
revealed Tokyo's plans to exploit Japanese-Americans.

Malkin has done the singular service of breaking the academic single-note
scholarship on a critical subject, cutting through a shabby, stultifying
consensus to reveal how, "given what was known and not known at the time,"
FDR and his staff did the right thing.

She correctly concludes that, especially in time of war, governments should
take into account nationality, ethnicity, and religious affiliation in thei=
r
homeland security policies and engage in what she calls "threat profiling."

These steps may entail bothersome or offensive measures but, she argues,
they are preferable to "being incinerated at your office desk by a flaming
hijacked plane."=20

since everyone on the list wants to talk about this I think it is important
to have some long term perspective-

Exclusivist Religion

exclusivist religion is a creation of Israelite theology see the Torah.
Starting with Moses through Joshua the Prophets and down to the centuries
after Christ Jews had a religion and a world-view unlike their Roman
neighbors of exclusivity one God one and a chosen people.

Christianity and Judahism were Rivals in the Roman Empure

When Christianity arose Judahism and Christianity were rivals for
marketshare for this exclusivity so to speak and a series of events occured
that colored the future and these events were not motivated by Anti-Semitism
but by competition for converts. First off during the two Jewish uprisings
of 70 CE and 135 CE Christians sided more or less with the Romans- they did
not support the Jewish rebellion and they used the Destruction of the Temple
as a way of obtaining converts, St Paul in fact in his letters always sides
with the Romans and against the Jewish authorities.

The New Testament is a Retort to Judahism

The New Testament was written expressly as a retort and a mission document
to contrast Christianity from Judahism. The anti Jewish statements in the
New Testament are expressly written for the purpose of showing that
Christianity has surpassed Judahism. These were not Anti Semitic statements
in the sense we have today but they did plant the seeds for future Anti
Semitism.

Jamna and the Rabbis

At Jamna after the fall of the Temple in 73 CE in Palestine Johannan Ben
Zakkai began the work of saving Judahism (not Judaism which arose from the
Rabbi's) during this time and later Christians were expelled from
Synagogues.  This competition continued with Christians and Jews; both
missionary religions at this time competing for converts. Both sides used
language that today would be viewed as "Anti Semitic" and "anti Christian" .
After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE Jews inside the Roman Empire
retained special status, they did not have to sacrifice to the gods or serve
in the military.

The Persecution of the Christians

Christians because most were gentiles did not and when Christians were
persecuted Jews like the Christians before them during the rebellions stood
by and did nothing.  Thus at the moment of Christianity's triumph under
Constantine in 330 Jews and Christians had been competing more or less
equally for 300 years. This all changed during the Constantine-Theodosius
period. Pagans, Gnostic Christians, and Jews were persectuted by Christians.

Jews Sided with Pagans

But during this period when Pagans regained control the Jews sided with them
for example during the period of Julian the Apostate when he persecuted the
Christians the Jews sided with him. Then again during the Persian invasion
period in the 560's the Jews sided with the Zoroastrians. So the original
Anti-Jewish sentiment of Christianity did not arise from a Racial
issue but a religious competition that Christianity won.  It is interesting
to think what would have happened if the Jews had won the competition for
converts?  would be discussing 2000 years of Anti-Christian Pogroms? Just a
question to ponder.

Origins of the Blood Libel

This is the ground on which Christian anti-semitism is based the original
hatred for the Jews was not borne from the whole "christ killer" mindset but
out of a competition for souls and conversion in the Roman period.  So where
does the tradition Jew Hating Christian  come from? - I would argue that it
comes from the fact that in the 700-800 period half of the Christian world
fell to the Muslims- there were no Muslims in France or Italy at that time
and the only "other" were Jews and they had contacts with Muslims and other
Jews and thus were easy to hate.

True Anti Semitism

The first true Anti Semitic act in the contemporary sense event occured in
Mainz in 1000's when the Crusaders killed that towns Jewish community. The
first person to legitimize the Blood Libel was Bernard of Clairvaux who in
1105 called on Christians to attack the Jews it was Bernard who legitimized
this. We also have dear Saint Bernard to thank for the whole Madonna/Whore
paradigm that has done so much for our world and also for some great poetry
so I guess he is kind of the Ezra Pound of his age?

I think that it is important to realize that all that I have written about
led to later Anti Semitism but that until the Crusader period Anti Semitism
was not the cancer that is later became. Also I think it is important to
realize that looking at historical events from our perspective-with our
sensibilities is often not useful since we cannot truly understand what was
happening to a pre-industrial culture that is very unlike our own.

Having said that I wonder what people 500 years from now will think when
they read that 150,000 died and millions were homeless from a Tidal Wave in
Asia and the US is spending less on that distaster than it is spending on
the Inauguration of its Faux president? Will they think us bigoted and
stupid?

He was publishing in the 30s, but some of what has been talked here about
was published more than 20 years before. Prufrock was ? 08 ? 09? By the 30s
he was well on the way to being a pillar of the British constipation

There's a general assumption that dickens was in some way wholesome, I think
& he tells stories with beginnings and middles and often nice ends. All of
this will endear him. Dickens is a thing you say to yourself, in many
quarters, without necessarily reading him - over here we have roast beef of
old england (fading more than a bit), Dunkirk, Churchill, Queen Mother
(irreplaceable, quite irreplaceable), bits of Princess Di (there is a
joke there but I won't make it) & Dickens can be part of that in a kittens
and mittens way

T S Eliot, or Toilets as he has been known, doesn't get to tap into this. So
he suffers from the attitude which might say I always suspected he might be
because he's a bit difficult, isn't he; whereas Dickens means God bless us
everyone and Uncle Pumblechooks's pork pie rather than sponteneous human
combustion, dust heaps etc. Though of course that - the dust heaps and so
on - is just where the person was perhaps least pro demonisation. Both
gentlemen were complex and dealing with complex responses

What we now condemn, in the midst of its continuance, was not theirs alone;
they were giving voice to what was abroad

Can you say more about Judahism / Judaism? Or can you point me to a source
where I can read about it? I know I don't grasp what you are saying. Maybe
this is something I forgot?

>The New Testament was written expressly as a retort and a mission document

Do you infer that the NT was written for that purpose?

 These were not Anti Semitic statements

I am trying to think of anything in the NT which could be the *seeds of
anti-semitism; but my memory of NT isnt that good. If you have any readily
to mind, could you say so I can understand?

NB I am taking you literally on seeds. Of course I accept that things were
distorted - the crusades would be one example of that

Mark wrote:

>>[I]maginary muslims were rarely burned at the
stake. Jews weren't so lucky.<<

This is a point that has been running implicitly through Mark's posts in
this thread that needs to be underlined again and again. The Jews who were
the objects of European Jew-hatred in Shakespeare's time, and for centuries
before and centuries after, were real people with real bodies that were bent
and broken and burned, and with real lives that were ruined, financially and
otherwise, at the whim of whomever happened to have the power to ruin them
at the moment. And even as late as the 19th century, when conversion to
whichever form of Christianity held sway was the only way for Jews to
advance professionally in just about any field they chose to enter, it was
real people who were made to choose between their faith and the lives they
wanted to lead. And these facts deserve our respect when we talk about
Jew-hatred/anti-Semitism in historical, literary, sociological or other
terms, because these facts are always, cannot help but be, a subtext of
Jew-hatred wherever and however it is expressed.

This is not to single Jew-hatred/anti-Semitism out as somehow different from
any of the other isms--sexism, racism, etc. To talk about racism in the
United States without being accountable to the fact that slavery happened to
real people or the fact of, say, the systemic racial bias of how the death
penalty is applied, or to talk about the witch burnings, or about marital
rape, or reproductive rights, or about all of the ways in which women have
been oppressed, without being accountable to the fact that this oppression
was visited upon real women with real bodies, is a travesty. The same holds
true now, as it did not in Europe at the time of Shakespeare, when we talk
about anti-Arab racism. There are Arabs, in Palestine and elsewhere, who are
being oppressed and killed simply because they are Arab, and to talk now
about this particular manifestation of racism without being accountable to
that fact is simply wrong.

And it is important to remember this precisely because we are having this
conversation in a "space" where language is all we have, where we don't have
each other's bodies to react to, where it is so easy to retreat into the
images and symbols and values in our cultural imaginary and forget that they
are not now and never were all equal in how they apply to the physical world
in which we live.

As writers we play with words--a very serious kind of play, but it is play
nonetheless--which means we play with ideas, and at the level of play all
words/ideas *are* in some sense equal. The parallels between and among how
Jews, Muslims, Blacks, Asians, women, Latinos are treated in the cultural
imaginations of the White Christian west are important and worthy of study,
but the symbols, images, words that represent those groups in the cultural
imagination have specific histories and to avoid dealing with those
histories, to deny them, is an expression, to return to a point I made in an
earlier post, of a white (male) (Christian) liberal privilege that only ends
up preserving the status quo.

And it would seem to me that this concern expressed by Mark, which I have
taken in my own direction, would be central to those of us who are writers
precisely because we understand how powerful language is and how utterly
deadly language can be when it is used to hide truths and misrepresent
facts.

It will be New Year's Eve when you all receive this. Have a good one!

In the first few centuries CE there was no clear distinction between
Jews and Christians, who were considered a sect of Jews.  So it
doesn't really work to say that the blood libel in the first century
CE was applied to "both" xians and jews.

Yes, exactly.  As Shelley said (and this I badly recall) all artists participate in their errors of their and their art reflects as through a distorting mirror the dim reality of that which is this life on earth.

There's a general assumption that dickens was in some way wholesome, I think
& he tells stories with beginnings and middles and often nice ends. All of
this will endear him. Dickens is a thing you say to yourself, in many
quarters, without necessarily reading him - over here we have roast beef of
old england (fading more than a bit), Dunkirk, Churchill, Queen Mother
(irreplaceable, quite irreplaceable), bits of Princess Di (there is a
joke there but I won't make it) & Dickens can be part of that in a kittens
and mittens way

T S Eliot, or Toilets as he has been known, doesn't get to tap into this. So
he suffers from the attitude which might say I always suspected he might be
because he's a bit difficult, isn't he; whereas Dickens means God bless us
everyone and Uncle Pumblechooks's pork pie rather than sponteneous human
combustion, dust heaps etc. Though of course that - the dust heaps and so
on - is just where the person was perhaps least pro demonisation. Both
gentlemen were complex and dealing with complex responses

What we now condemn, in the midst of its continuance, was not theirs alone;
they were giving voice to what was abroad

The Baudelaire of the Piedmont

DAN COLEMAN Columnist
Chapel Hill Herald (NC)
Saturday, December 25, 2004
Final Edition
Editorial Section
Page 2


Through all the focus on state and national political matters over the
past few months, an important event in the life of Carrboro received
inadequate attention. I refer to the August (and august) reappointment
of Carrboro's poet laureate, Patrick Herron.

With all the decidedly non-lyrical voices coming over the TV and radio
during election season and its aftermath, it's refreshing to be able to
step back and reflect on the significance of poetry to our lives and
culture.

Although we often don't credit it today, poetry has been a key factor in
marking the changes that accompanied what we consider the development of
modern society.

One seminal work in defining that relationship was the French poet
Baudelaire's 1865 prose poem "Loss of a Halo." Given Carrboro's current
focus on downtown traffic flow, it is appropriate to consider
Baudelaire's poetic look at a prominent poet who has crossed one of what
were then the still recently constructed boulevards of Paris.

"I made a sudden move and my halo slipped off my head and fell into the
mire of the macadam. I was much too scared to pick is up ... Now I can
walk around incognito, do low things, throw myself into every kind of
filth just like ordinary mortals."

Surely, it is this loss of the halo that adorned the gentlemen poets of
an earlier era that opened the door for the poets who described the 20th
century. Without that loss, it would hardly have been possible for
William Butler Yeats to warn of a "rough beast slouching toward
Bethlehem," for T.S. Eliot to wonder "should I then presume," for Allen
Ginsberg to howl about "the best minds of my generation destroyed by
madness," or for Maya Angelou to stand at Bill Clinton's inauguration
and remind us of a time "Before cynicism was a bloody sear across
your/Brow and when you yet knew you still/Knew nothing."

In 2002, the town of Carrboro picked the halo out of the mud, dusted it
off, and handed it to its first poet laureate, Kate Lovelady. Last year,
Lovelady named Patrick Herron as her successor and this year, at
Herron's suggestion, the term of office was extend to two years, with
Herron continuing on.

Herron explained last summer that he felt that the longer term was
necessary for the laureate to be effective, and should perhaps be as
long as four years. "In a town so small, there are simply not that many
poets who are willing to work hard as a an ambassador of poetry," he
said.

I asked Herron why he thought Carrboro in particular was a town with a
poet laureate. "We support the arts," he said, "and look to artists for
new ways of looking at things and for adding new dimensions to our
lives, whether those dimensions are decorative, intellectual or
emotional."

Herron also believes that Carrboro's political culture is connected to
its embracing the arts. "Politics in Carrboro is a rather open and
participatory enterprise," he said. "We're welcome to participate and
are encouraged to do so. The 'tyranny of the majority' in Carrboro is
made up of interests that are of the American minority: progressives,
African-Americans, intellectuals, Latinos, GLBTs, artists,
environmentalists, activists and so on."

Herron believes that poetry is challenged in our society by an
orientation toward the visual and an anti-intellectualism fostered by
the right wing. Potential poetry readers, he said, are lost through "the
systematic destruction of the public school system by the misanthropic
right."

The contemporary media has largely lost touch with poetry. A century
ago, Edwin Markham's "The Man with the Hoe" was printed on the front
page of newspapers across the country. Today, a poem fragment might
appear in the book review section if at all. Too few of us are familiar
with the poetry of the U.S. Poet Laureate Ted Kooser. Is it beyond the
pale to imagine the poetry of Kooser, Sharon Olds or Galway Kinnell
enlivening an episode of "Friends"?

Herron tells me that for every person who reads poetry there are 10 who
write it. I would guess that anyone who writes poetry also reads it, and
there are more than 5 million poets noted at poetry.com. But that's
still a lot less than watch "Desperate Housewives" each week.

But last June's first-ever Carrboro Poetry Festival drew 40 poets and
standing-room crowds. Herron would like to see more poets who write in a
way that both interacts with the austere concerns of other poets and
speaks to the hearts and minds of a broader audience.

Although that is a fine objective, I asked Herron his top goal as poet
laureate. "To find a replacement!" he replied.

A Friend of a friend (you know how that is), Ken Waldman aka "Alaska's
Fiddling Poet" will be in town for two gigs at the children's Museum in
Garden City on 2/12 and 2/13.
They're trying to find an evening gig for him on Sat. 2/12 and possibly
Sunday evening 2/13. Does anyone have suggestions for possible venus/opening
gigs/appearances?

there is a very good book called Surpassing Wonder I do not remember the
author but he writes about the Talmud and the New Testament and his
argument-whic his persuasive is that the origin of Christianity and Judaism
is Second Temple Judahism which is focused on temple worship and the
sacrifice of animals in the temple- this book is a great start to answer
this

yes the New Testament is a missionary document that was written to convert
people and to depricate the existing Monotheism Judaism- just read the
comments put in Jesus's mouth in the gospel of John

All of Paul's letters while not anti semitic have anti semitic seeds. teh
famous blood libel- "let his death be on us and our children" for example
from the gospels is an example;

I think that Mark is saying that what is a joke to one person at one time is
offensive to another person at another time (or of a different cultural or
world view) - I have made stupid jokes and (or not stupid perhaps if one
knows the kind of humour I was referring to - but out of context I suppose)
and the response by people has been varied (my daughters don't let me off
anything too much!! A man needs daughters!!) one has to be wary of what one
says to whom - but  a joke about the Scots is probably harmless on here as
we all know it is not meant too literally - if people go on making Scottish
jokes or Irish jokes I call a halt (I usually sense an antipathy) - and
similarly I have seen jokes by and about Jews by Jews and on Jews and have
found them funny but the humour wears thin the more it is used - a fellow I
used to by beer books, oddments etc from on the street (where I had book
stall/market) was from Bulgaria and he told me how terrible the Gypsies were
and the "Tukkus" as he called them - they were all criminals he said - I
didn't bother arguing as he was clearly totally convinced - I have met a lot
of people like that - one person I was trying to sell a book to got into
rave mode one the phone and according to him NZ was dangerously overloaded
with Asians and  people from the Middle East etc (this is common racial view
here especially amongst working class people -although it is cross -
class/religion and so on )  ..so Alison is right in her view that racism has
continued to until today (it may have declined somewhat but it continues
perhaps as strongly as in Dickens's time - but I don't think that Dickens
portrayal of Fagan is bad - don't see anything wrong with it) -  but we do
need to be vigilant about racism: without becoming too PC or Po-faced  - but
racism is still a real danger -  the Holocaust was so coldly deliberate that
there is a tendency to focus on ant-Semitism but racism is always stupid,
always ugly.

And as to pogroms etc - in Britain one of the Kings (who went on campaigns
slaughtering the Welsh etc(!)) ran out of money - supplied to a large extent
by Jewish financiers (this by a British/Jewish historian) and then proceeded
to put yellow stars on Jews in London and killed many, thousands I think -
he carried out a kind of pogrom/repression eerily like that of Goebbels an
Hitler's persecutions to come.

But in literature is not Bloom as the central character in Ulysses(Odysseus)
an example of positive view of Jewish? Joyce identified Odysseus/Bloom I
believe - though I'm not as familiar with that book as I maybe should be ( I
read it once but it is a book requires a lot of re-reads I think).

Is this a positive view by Joyce and are there other or what examples of
good or interesting view so people are there? I suppose eventually - in an
ideal world people would be defined by their personalities and personal or
individual attributes not any general class of attributes.  Meantime we have
a great number of different cultures/religions etc.

 I try to see each individual as he /she is right  in front of me - like
everyone of course I make erroneous and/or/ "vaguely true" generalisations
and tongue slips - but person to person I try to deal with the individual
herself or himself - whoever

Yes anti semitism is a part of a wider phenomena of racism in lterature and
life and we havent got the depths of where it comes from - it comes
ultimately from - fear I suppose - some Freudian complex or
omething  -someone has probably looked at (written about) it - and  yes, we
need to be aware and or research/discuss his phenomenom  - but we all need
to keep thinking about it  - it may always be with us this fear or this
paranoia -  its part of a world wide phenomena and a part of what we are -
we are all more or less "racist" or paranoid - whatever - hard to say
exactly what I mean here. But whatever it is this racism - it is ugly  -
and we wont give in to it.

Happy New Year ot Everyone.   ( I said Happy New Year to my cat but it gave
no comment -what is wrong with it?)

Yup, Rob, and I don't demur from how they feel about it - I used to like York, going round the walls, ogling at the Minster, having
tea at Mrs Bridges, admiring Mallard at the Railway Museum, staying by the Rowntrees factory with the smell of chocolate wafting on
the air, UNTIL I found out about that fact you allude to, of which I was ignorant, I can't go to the place anymore, I hadn't thought
about this for a while but you've reminded me that I really have a block on that and why.

It may have happened as long ago as 1190, but the Jews, like the Scots and
the Irish, have long memories.

        There are still McDonalds who won't sit beside a Campbell on a bus.

I'm not sure whether this is admirable or appalling or simply baffling, but

            I think that law may still be on the statute-books.

Does it count that the McGregors were a sept of the clan Campbell, and
"Campbell" {as in Robin Roy McGregor Campbell, a.k.a. Rob Roy McGregor} was
a passing name?)

Yeah, Rob, long memories do count. I'm not sure whether I have one or not, I certainly don't have a clan kind of thing, but all true
Brummies like me recall the fact that Prince Rupert's cavalry slaughtered the Parliamentarian Brummies in the Battle of Camp Hill.
for instance. I'd observe though that the kind of particularism you and I joke about must be immensely puzzling to some of our US
friends, the international middle class, which includes a lot of so-called writers, are blithely unaware of this stuff, as they
don't see it, in between airport departure lounges, you know as echt Glasgie as I know as echt Brum the other side of things, my
little vixen pulls my leg about my accent as she's from Nottingham but I get let off the hook as my grandparents came from Eastwood
(yeah, DHL territory) I know you don't do English variations whereas I have a slight sense of Scots differennces, but, to be
specific, just as you have a phobia about things Edinburgh the one and only prejudice I have is against people from Wolverhampton.
It is a shared feeling: Brummies can't stand Wulfronians and vice-versa. I don't have a problem with Yammers, (that's people from
the Black Country in Between Brum and Wolves), I certainly am ok with the surviving rustics in Warwicks ( after all, altho' raised
in Brum I was born in the county, so I'm technically a yokel myself) and can even tolerate the Chizzits of Leicester that I live
among these days but I can't stay in the same room with a anyone from Wolverhampton ( I've tried)

Hope our dear Yankees aren't too puzzled by this, I like them a lot.


All the Best
