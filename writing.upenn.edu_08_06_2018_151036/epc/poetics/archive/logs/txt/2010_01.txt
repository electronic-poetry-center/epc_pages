So glad you mentioned Bolano, David: I'm reading him at the moment and
finding him revelatory.

This is a bit of a sidejump from Catherine's comments, but I think
relevant. I've been spending a bit of time, for admittedly low-grade
voyeuristic amusement, lurking around fanfic communities.  What
strikes me forcibly is the parallels between online fan communities
and poetry communities: both are non-mainstream (even if mostly
derivative from mass culture, fanfic is feral) cultural communities
passionate, often one-eyed, about their concerns. You get very
familiar-looking flame wars, a dizzying number of cliques rallying
around each other and fighting others, usually over "canon", the same
struggling for notice and influence, the same arguments about
criticism (what they call, bless them, "concrit"), and exactly the
same discussions about whether reviews ought to be honest or nice, or
whether they just follow lines of community influence, and how
"supportive" criticism is bad for the writing community as a whole,
etc etc etc. You even get the same kinds of trollings which are then
explained, like some of Kent Johnson's shenanigans, as "social
experiment" (once they've got the whole community outraged and
spitting acronyms and everybody has resigned/been banned/given up).
They've got the lot in terms of discourse - it runs the whole gamut
from lolcats and loony abuse to serious and thoughtful discussion.

Admittedly, the spelling can be out-there mediaeval and the grammar
often uncertain (although often it isn't); but in some ways the ethics
of some of the more intelligent communities are way ahead of many
poetry communities, especially in terms of gender/queer politics and
various discussions of privilege (abled, gendered, race). But that is
by the bye.

It occurs to me that the (endless) discussions about criticism might
be an inevitable spinoff of passionate and self-focused communities
gathering volubly online, with the crossover that happens online
between what were once more clearly cut amateur and professional
divisions. Poetry has always been a little fuzzy on this one, because
it's relied on small presses for the distribution of new work. Lucid
and disinterested criticism or reviewing can help in sorting out the
more rewarding work from the plethora of stuff available, which is why
it's important; but because of the social structures of communities -
various loyalties, collations of belief, clique rules, tunnel-vision
focus etc it becomes harder and harder to find in the thickets.

What's clear in any case is that calling for negative criticism as a
corrective to fanboy lurv is, as Catherine says, the other side of the
same coin. Excellent criticism is often positive. Negative criticism
is often as thoughtless as a puff piece. Maybe we should just be
looking for "useful criticism"?

It is true that you live on this rock
And in it. It is wholly you.

It is true that there are thoughts
That move in the air as large as air,

That are almost not our own, but thoughts
To which we are related,

In an association like yours
With the rock and mine with you.

I liked your take, Alison. A side point, but I don't think you need to be so
critical of your interest in the fan community -- after all they are people
who are learning to write in a genre, and/or expressing their love of books
in their genre.

My take on negative reviews is related to what Jonathan Gold says about
reviewing restaurants -- there are so many good books out there that deserve
attention/readers, why waste time on reviewing books that one dislikes. This
doesn't preclude situating the book in a stream of poetry, and pointing out
over-reliance on conventions of one type or another. But I guess, outside of
a college class, I don't understand why anyone would want to read or write
reviews of books they feel no sympathy with.

Happy New Year,
Carol

Dear Alison and Catherine:

"Useful criticism"--yes to this!--

Re Bolano:  the novella *Chile By Night *is the stream of consciousness
deathbed confession of a Priest-critic-poet, Father Ibanache, whose name &
self appear in other Bolano works, most notably *Distant Star*, itself an
"expansion" of the final entry in* Nazi Literature of the Americas. *The
Father's story takes place primarily during the Pinochet years, with the
good Priest acting as a representative and go-between among the Institutions
of the dictatorship, the Church and Chilean Literature; the poet-critic is
sent by the State on a mission to Europe to discover how the deterioration
of monasteries anc chruches due to bird shit is being handled so
efficiently, as well as at one point being asked to be the Regime's Inner
Circle's tutor in a seminar in Marxism. Among the torture chambers, there
dwells, fittingly a Black, Gallows Humor--

And, literally, just upstairs from the torture chambers in a household run
by an American agent and his would-be novelist Chilean wife, is a famous
Literary Salon--based on a "true story" of the times; the house where the
salon was held is under consideration as a National Museum----at which are
gathered al the shining lights of Chilean writing--poetry ,drama, criticism,
belles-lettres, etc. It is to this house that Fr. Ibanache returns near the
very end of his journey into the night, vi sting the now shamed, deserted
wife and the closed down Salon haunted by rumors, ghosts, screams--and it is
here that the now barely surviving woman remarks that Chilean literature is
made out of this--that it emerges from torture hidden in the basements of
the cozy literary worlds, mingling with the State, torturers, American
agents and various "intellectual" military types. Driving away from the
almost palpable horrors screaming in his head, the Father wonders if, after
all, it is not al literature which is now emerging from just such chambers
of horrors, concealed neatly beneath the rituals of the literary world.
       The world of Bolano's post 9/11/73 Chile is now the world of post
9/11/2001 USA, where a world-wide network of secret torture prisons, of Abu
Ghraibs and Guantanamos as well as the horrors of domestic detention
centers, is the "sub (terranean) text"of an American writing which is
tremendously productive of  writing from which al such horrors are
expunged.  As Pierre Vidal-Naquet, in the book of his i previously
cited, *Torture
Cancer of Democracy*--remarks, what began as a police mission, developed
into a military operation and became, finally, a clandestine institution.(As
Vidal-Naquet notes, the seeming contradictory nature of "clandestine
institution" in itself is a sign of the forced equivalencies of meaning, of
terms--)  At the very heart of the torturing State's language lie the
tortured bodies of its various and ever more abundant "enemy combatants," as
well as an ever increasing number of "undesireds" and "disappeareds" on the
domestic scene.

 In order for language to handle the contradictions which are exposed, like
Poe's Purloined Letter, in plain site/sight/cite, it is necessary for it to
function as the Orwellian unity, the "equals signs," of War=Peace and so
on--not unlike President Obama's Nobel Peace Prize Speech which was a
justification for the ramping up of his "right war" in Afghanistan and areas
of Pakistan and now Yemen. The President himself is a walking example of the
Orwellian Newspeak in that he is a Black President supportive of the
Apartheid of the USA's number one ally. Rather than "taking sides' on these
issues--which would be much about denying or "softening" them--I think, like
Bolano, one  might find such events interesting and useful as a way to open
investigations into the writing of poetry as well as criticism.  That is,
what is writing in such a situation, what forms of critique of a useful
nature may be made not only of works but of the language itself used by
them? What is the para-critical, meta-critical nature of such discourse?
What is the relationship of not only silence, "sins of omission" to existing
and possible, potential writing and criticism, essays, but also what is
their relationship with what a Russian artist has said re language--that it
is a fascism in that it is not silence which stifles, which censors, but  a
"being forced to speak," which is the objective of torture--not to elicit
"the truth" so much as to force a speaking from the subject, regardless of
its content--to force a formal construction--a "confession,"
"intelligence"--which as "language material" exists as "proof" that
something has been articulated which recognizes and affirms, "proves," the
"rightness" of the State, its wars, its language, its Institutions--

As Vidal-Naquet might point out yet again--the very nature of the
clandestine has become Instiutionalized, hidden in plain
site/sight/cite--and so--invisible--taekn to be "things as they are" to such
an extent that to point out their actual existence as something troubling in
itself is considered "wrong," "perverse," and so forth--

I am suggesting that this is one possible set of tools with which to work in
writing re writing, in working with a method of "criticism;"  itis by no
means "the only way" or even particularly the "right way"--the words "right
war" have led one to wonder after all, what is a "right" war--so one wonders
if there is any such thing as a "right" criticism or reviewing or writing of
poetry itself--rather than embracing what is often accepted almost without
question whatever way is being taken to be "the right one." That is, a
"useful and interesting" critique is not "aimed at" producing yet more texts
conforming to the "norms' or "resistances" already on the tbale, but to go
outside, beyond these either/or battles and find many other ways of
considering the actions of lanaguge in relation with what they think they
are--or intend to--be thinking, "saying," "doing."
The original meaning of the term avant-garde was a military one--today,
there is wha is called the "avant," the "post-avant" --a cutting in half of
the original term, so that what is left is an idea of "avant" as a form of
"forward"/"before"/"post/after before"--with the military overtones "left
behind."  Yet the early avant-gardes such as Italian Futurism  (Pro) and
Dada (anti) confronted directly war and the military aspects of the arts as
expressed in speed, design, shattering of grammar, syntax, punctuations, the
uses of sound and noise, of technologies or crude, non-technologies as ways
of examining what the actions of art are in relation with the military in
times of war. In this sense, ":avant" in itself signals perhaps a turning
away from any such confrontation, making it easier to turn away from other
related issues such as torture, Apartheid, mass murder, ethnic
cleansing--while at the same time preserving a sense of "moving forward,"
"being progressive"--"coming after"--a useful question: are "avant" or "post
avant" on their own "progressive"--or "reactionary"--or--?? the assumptionis
that they are "progressive'--wheras what Bolano examines is the possiblities
equally of politically "reactionary" avant-gardes--which of course, are well
known to exist throughout the 20th Century and into the current one--)

One might find even such seemingly slight shifts as this--"avant-garde" to
"avant"--very useful as "can openers' so to speak for the opening of
discussions which have become perhaps overly "canned."  I think that one
finds in Bolnao's works just such an investigation going on, into the
military nature of militant avant-gardes, or--"anti-militant" avants,
or--militant avants-- such as the ones Alison writes of so brilliantly among
the incredibly vast variety of communities of discussion--and forms of
discussion-- on line--

Besides, isn't there something unimaginative,"non-challenging" in countering
"too much positivity" with massive doses of negativity?" Isn't this just
another way of "balancing the equals sign"--?  If one wrote reviews as an
unsigned reviewer--would it change one's writing as such, let alone one's
ways of thinking positively or negatively of the work being reviewed?  After
all, the unsigned *faits divers* of Felix Feneon today are read and enjoyed
so much because they are expressive of Feneon's style and his methods of
thinking, his ideological points of view.  Feneon did not think of these
unsigned pieces as being somehow ""not mine" but as "writing at a
distance"--that is at a distance from the signed name--which might possibly
be a way of distancing oneself from--what more--that is the interesting
situation which the writer is posing--consider, after al, that Feneon wrote
under various pseudonyms, and depending on the nature of the journal,
adopted his style, his vocabulary, to that demanded either directly or
indirectly by the journal's editors.  (For example, one journal he wrote for
required its Anarchist based articles be written in working people's slang
rather than in a bourgeois mode of expression--just as one writes
differently for say a daily paper than from a specialized journal--)

As Bolano's work demonstrates and that of Poe,  Borges and many
others--criticism need not be limited to a form of "non-fiction," but may be
part of  a fictional context also.
 These are just a few suggestions suggesting hopefully how many many more
one may continaully open up--and with that Happy New Year to all!

Responding to Catherine Daly's precision: "part of the problem seems to be =
the conflation of criticism and reviewing"

I posted this in another note=2C but here it is again: reconfigurations.blo=
gspot.com (section titled "Review Review")

"the true nature of the problem=2C which few of the [Mayday] roundtable par=
ticipants engaged except obliquely": that was more or less my thinking
in gathering the Reconfigurations gathering.  See my introduction=2C or pre=
face=2C I can't remember=2C it addresses this directly.

Part of the problem seems to be the conflation of criticism and
reviewing=2C or a practice of criticism rising up from=2C being abstracted
from=2C reviews.
=20
So what is the difference between a negative review and criticism
which uncovers and / or discusses serious flaws in a work?  Isn't the
latter more interesting?  We can recognise the difference between a
puff piece and a review which finds a lot -- even everything -- to
praise in a work.  But do we think of positive reviews as criticism?
Do we think of them as puff pieces=2C especially when the writer has a
motive to praise?
=20
Now that so many more books are being published=2C on micropresses=2C do
we still have the idea that a book which doesn't receive a review is
so bad no one could praise it?  What about all the books published
which are only reviewed -- raved -- by friends of the author=2C because
the author wasn't able to access "real" reviewers for whatever reason?
=20
Which is part of what Poe was writing and part of what I feel is the
true nature of the problem=2C which few of the roundtable participants
engaged except obliquely. And as these are some of the most fluent
reviewers -- well=2C one has to read between the lines of the roundtable
just as one reads between the lines of reviews.

First to Allen, thanks to for the extra kick along to read more of your
writings which I had already hoped to do, but I ordered Liz Grosz's book
first. (A shortage of money thing...) Your suggestions of cheating in SL
has me thinking again of difficulties that can be encountered by
following Luce Irigaray's strategies of jamming the mechanism. By
jamming in this way one may encounter something far more terrible and
intolerable then that from which escape is sought. Anyway, I am
interested in reading your thoughts on this before I can make further
comments.

Jim, by your own reckoning I did my first degree at a quaint and
outmoded place known as an institute of technology. Essential to passing
this degree was the ability to understand the media you are working with
which includes knowing the history of the technology and understanding
the poetics and aesthetics problems involved on top of being able to
think critically and come up with original thought and ideas. The
problems of interactivity is fairly old hat stuff here, last heard of
about twenty or thirty years ago from my memory.

If you are going to call on the naming logos god and claim the authority
of an early media critic such as Marshall McLuhan who says the medium is
the message then it would be a good idea to actually read him. Here you
will find that McLuhan is actually referring to and using the earlier
writings of Kant and the actual aesthetic problems of mechanism which
Kant did write about some centuries ago. Interactivity and programming
is actually a Kantian mechanism, prior to his more important and famous
book with its passages on the sublime.

I was being factually accurate when I wrote that using a monorail view
camera and silver gelatin was a newer technology then computer code by
around two centuries. To be more precise as to the history of computer
coding technology we would have to go back further to Leibniz. But then
I graduated from an old fashion out of date technology institute, so
what do I know about computers.

As for your mythical future metaphysical world that would prove you
right, may I suggest you read Aristotle. And coding such a world is a
trivial matter. It has been done many times on Sony and Xbox computer
games. While we are with Aristotle it would also be a good idea to have
a look at Plato and the problems of transitivity with regard to poetics.

With best wishes, Chris Jones.

reading between the lines? that's exhausting/double guessing & ... ambiguity is a damn sight better than dogmatic anything, but why should reviews involve so much hair splitting? Harold Bloom is easy enough to understand. But he's a scholar. Maybe we need more scholars reviewing books.

Subject: Re: Edgar Allan Poe & Negative Reviews

Part of the problem seems to be the conflation of criticism and
reviewing, or a practice of criticism rising up from, being abstracted
from, reviews.

So what is the difference between a negative review and criticism
which uncovers and / or discusses serious flaws in a work?  Isn't the
latter more interesting?  We can recognise the difference between a
puff piece and a review which finds a lot -- even everything -- to
praise in a work.  But do we think of positive reviews as criticism?
Do we think of them as puff pieces, especially when the writer has a
motive to praise?

Now that so many more books are being published, on micropresses, do
we still have the idea that a book which doesn't receive a review is
so bad no one could praise it?  What about all the books published
which are only reviewed -- raved -- by friends of the author, because
the author wasn't able to access "real" reviewers for whatever reason?

Which is part of what Poe was writing and part of what I feel is the
true nature of the problem, which few of the roundtable participants
engaged except obliquely. And as these are some of the most fluent
reviewers -- well, one has to read between the lines of the roundtable
just as one reads between the lines of reviews.

what's the difference between a scholar reviewing, an academic
reviewing, and a would-be academic reviewing?  one would hope,
nothing.  however, there is a big difference in the  relationship to
literature and to teaching and to source of income/employment.

one of the things that drew me toward criticism and reviewing is that
it is the last bastion of the self-appointed amateur; it is not as
though I can really do philosophy or paint without being an
outsider/never getting "in", but not only can I be a self-appointed
critic, being somewhat outside is good for that.

if reviewing has mostly become a way for less experienced writers --
or those still in school -- to engage more accomplished
writers/published writing and the writing community, aren't reviews
peculiarly anonymous, in that the majority of reviews aren't written
by "names"?

have any reviewers found many blurbs and flap copy / liner notes *not*
to be helpful, or prejudicial, or whatever, even if only because they
are written by "names" and/or the author?

what is the difference between "going negative" -- which has
quasi-political overtones -- and describing what seems to the reviewer
to be bad and giving reasons?

while dogma vs. ambiguity -- maybe it is just a choice, I would rather
have a clear argument to consider -- to investigate by reading and
thinking -- than a pile of grey slush.

Hi all - Just to be clear, I wasn't arguing against negative
criticism. "Useful" reviews/criticism can of course be negative
(criticism that is negative isn't by that virtue "useful", is all).
And the other thing I think about "useful" criticism - this with my
theatre critic hat on, in which guise I've thought a lot about this
question - is that there needs to be a lot of it; maybe what's most
crucial about a healthy critical community, aside from a disinterest
inflected through a common passion, is its diversity of viewpoint.
It's pretty easy to know what useful criticism is, I think: it's
informed, well written, seriously attends to the art in question, is
conscious of context, genealogy etc. And for my money is felt as well
as smart.

To answer your question seriously for a moment, Jared, I've been
thinking alot lately about ethics and art in relation to the question
of the "good", which I agree is a box of worms that always has to be
open. I don't believe in criticism "leading" anywhere - I can't see
art and progress in the same sentence - but the question of ethics has
been getting more urgent for me over the past few years, which doesn't
mean I've reached any conclusions. Maybe a useful criticism is one
that is aware of ethics; David has a good example of that kind of
searching. I guess I'm speaking more about a constantly evolving
process than any result. The aim might be, if you need one, to be more
conscious, to be part of a stimulating discourse.

Carol, I wasn't being critical so much as honest about my fascination
with fanfic. Fan communities in all their glorious weirdness and
variety can be hilarious (to those who are part of them as well as the
outsider voyeur) as well as fascinating. I discovered them when fanfic
started being written from my own genre novels, so I can't claim that
I am not, however tangentially, implicated in that community myself or
that I am in any way "above" it.  One thing: like poetry, it's very
difficult to generalise: fandom is a huge subculture, ranging from
Harry Potter and Twilight through obscure animes and comics to
seriously brilliant writing and graphic novels.

Jared, I'm sorry I missed class in my list of privilege, although
given the social status of genre culture v literature, there's
actually a lot of class discussion. I remember eg a fair bit of class
indignation a few years ago when Harold Bloom attacked the awarding of
Stephen King with a major literary prize, bemoaning it as the end of
literature. Genre/mass culture fandom includes people of extremely
various classes, abledness, education, sexuality (furries omg) and so
on (and a lot of geeky autodidacts) - by its nature it trawls a wider
net than poetry. It's self-policing, in a brutal way, because stupid
or straight-out misogynist/racist/homophobic/snobby statements will
result in a lot of merciless mockery. But on its wilder fringes, it is
pretty lawless.

My points about the parallels are maybe crude, but all the same, KJ
would unambiguously be called a troll if he turned up in Harry Potter
fandom, which seems to attract a great number of very similar
"experiments": sockpuppets, invented identities, etc - with similar
results to what happened years ago on the British poetry list, eg (and
even the same kinds of discussions about intellectual ownership). Not
wanting to open old scars here, I hasten to say, just making an
observation. And there are certainly communities of self-identified
capslock trolls who proudly go around setting flames. Whatever, I'm
not personally interested in "controlling" anything; although I find
some things more interesting than others.

xA

Anyone remember the E. V. Griffith School of Criticism (was it in
Poetry Now?)? When he came upon a poetry collection he enjoyed,
he'd display in a box in his mag a poem or two or maybe three. That
was it: no slush, no mush, no bother.

the 'game' aspect of the literary is nowhere so evident as in such matters
as canon, awards, grants, and so forth. the main rules are know the judges
but, first and foremost, validate the world view of the judges. especially
the ones with money.

yet, for all that, yes, there are writers/poets who deserve to be widely
read and recognized.

art is a rigged game.

there are two types of power. there's power that others confer on you. and
there's your own power and strength as a person and an artist. it's
important to work on the latter. to be able to really enjoy life and art and
pursue new things with passion and intensity. we cultivate the former at our
own risk. what would you rather play? snakes and ladders or a game where the
goal is not so much winning or losing as pursuit of the meaning of life?

but we are always embroiled in both, aren't we? the enigmas of fortune and
life.

Because of the various distinctions within literary theory that=20

orientation, politics etc., I think the days of a single universally=20

Or talk to people with whom one feels no sympathy, etc.? There's the
risk stepping outside one's boundaries that they may expand.

Most of the reviews I've done have been requested by editors. Should
I have declines to review books that I discover I don't like?

What does one do when a friend asks for a review and you don't like
the book? In the past I've begged out by telling the friend as much,
risking the friendship. I owe too much to the craft to which I've

The usefulness of a negative review for the critic is the examination
it requires of what one considers the limits of form or taste. Not a
bad thing to do. The usefulness for the reader is the opportunity to
consider those boundaries.

The usefulness of a bad restaurant review is the warning about
wasting money and time (not to mention food poisoning).

Herb, there is NOTHING simple about WANTING TO NOT be cynical when
voting.  My grandmother used to sing a song when I was a kid with the
line, "The cynic and the killer waltz together."  I allow that line to
haunt my decisions, keep me in check.

You say it is "simply a sign" about me though.  Not so simple, and
you're incorrect as I was paying close attention.  And what you say is
being said all day long on the news to anyone who makes their voices
heard against Obama's decision to increase the war machine.  We're
being told that we "weren't paying attention."  It's not new what
you're saying.  It's a game to make people like you feel GREAT because
you get to say you were paying attention, and point a finger at people
like me to make us feel stupid, it's a game of Simon Says Tell Them
How Stupid They Are.  And you do it, and feel great.

You must recall how Obama humiliated Hilary Clinton about her vote for
the invasion of Iraq?  In doing so he pointed a finger at her to call
her, in front of MILLIONS of viewers, The War President To Be.  He did
that to her to rally the anti-war vote.  He took her down and smeared
her face in it.

And yes I was paying close attention to Obama talk about the
differences he saw in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but he NEVER ONCE
SAID that he intended to increase the war.  He talked about
reallocation of troops, and he spoke an awful lot about What Would
Obama Do, if Obama had been in the White House at the time.  He even
spoke quite frankly about Pakistan, and what he thinks should have
been done there.  But he DID NOT say "Oh, and when I am president I
PROMISE to send EXTRA troops, MORE TROOPS, in fact 30,000 in my first
year."  No, he did not.

Herb, you should write to the Nobel Prize committee while you're at
it, tell them what you tell me.  The saddest thing about the decision
for that prize is that no one had the courage to say to him when he
arrived to receive it, "OH NO YOU DON'T, WE MADE A MISTAKE!"

Herb, please think about how it's NOT simple the next time you point
your finger at someone like me who desperately wanted peace, wanted
the killing in their name to STOP.  People like me, who has thousands
of dead bodies filled with bullets coming in the near future, paid for
with votes and taxes.

I'm never voting for another president, at least not a Democrat.  Let
the voters taste the blood by themselves next time.

A shout out to those who cannot sleep at night for what we have done,
I'm with you,

What gives you the impression that I haven't read McLuhan? I wrote something
about him at http://vispo.com/writings/essays/mcluhana.htm that is widely
read. I read McLuhan when I was producing a literary radio show in the
eighties. And read him again when I started learning HTML in 1995.

As for Kant, I expect you're right that McLuhan knew and used Kant. But
McLuhan's ideas on media are probably about as strongly indebted to Kant as
the development of the computer is to Leibniz.

Leibniz is considered quite important concerning computing, yes. But he
never built anything like a computer. He envisioned (but never built) a
logic machine that would be an aide to human reason, so that when heads of
state sat down to solve the problems of the world, they would say 'Now let
us calculate!' and wheel in Leibniz's envisioned aide to reason. He
envisioned a language of symbolic logic and a machine that could be used to
generate true propositions in that language. And he always maintained that
if only he could set aside five years to this project, it would be a truly
wonderful thing. But between his original mathematical work and the demands
of Mr. Hanover, his boss, with whom he was employed to write the family
history (did he ever finish that?), he just never got those five years.

There's a genuinely important book by Martin Davis called 'Engines of Logic'
which looks at the life and work of Leibniz, Boole, Frege, Cantor, Hilbert,
Godel, and Turing concerning the development of symbolic logic and the
computer. The development of symbolic logic and the computer had quite a way
to go from Leibniz to Turing, Chris. Leibniz was on the (real) job, and was
closer to building a computer than my childhood dreams of building a rocket
ship from wood in the back yard but, well, it never happened. I'm still
here. 2010 beyond a space odyssey. But still not down to earth.

I highly recommend Martin Davis's book. Davis himself is quite a renowned
logician. So the book is top notch in the 'history of ideas' vein, but it's
also terrific in its biographical sketches of these men, these paragons of
reason. Godel starved himself to death out of paranoia that his food was
being poisoned. Cantor was in and out of sanitoria and his work was never
properly recognized in his lifetime. Many considered his work deeply flawed.
Turing (probably) committed suicide. Frege was apparently an anti-Semite.

In any case, the book gives one some sense of the distance between Leibniz
and Turing concerning the development of symbolic logic and the computer.

What gives you the impression that I think badly of institutes of
technology? I never said a word about it. Or is that just a way of telling
me that you studied both literature and technology?

Oh I've read Aristotle and Plato, Chris. Long ago. But perhaps I will
re-read them some day. They're always generative for me.

Concerning interactivity and computers, I think we still have a long way to
go with them, as artists. Domic Lopes's claim, in his book 'A Philosophy of
Computer Art', that computer art is a new art form is still true, though
computers and computer art have been around since the second half of the
last century. Compared with other art forms, which generally have a much
longer history, it's new. And it's still new also in the range of unexplored
possibilities. And in the general lack of understanding of what it is all
about.  There is a great deal of ignorance about computers and,
correspondingly, a great deal of fear and suspicion about them. And hence
about computer art.

But it is obvious that computers are becoming more ubiquitous in society and
also the devices they are part of are proliferating and will continue to do
so. We need to come to grips with them, and computer art is, I think, an
important part of that process. We need to come to grips with them like we
need to come to grips with pen and paper. Computer art shows us what it
means to be computer literate in the same way that reading poetry is part of
becoming literate in the usual sense. And a sense of interactivity, its
conventions and protocols, its possibilities and its possible human
connection, is important to that literacy.

Shortly before Christmas, we received some excellent news from the =20
Humanities in the European Research Area (HERA) review panel. Our =20
project =93Electronic Literature as a Model of Creativity and Innovation =
=20
in Practice=94 has been recommended for funding, pending final contract =20=

negotiations with the European Science Foundation to be completed in =20
January 2010. Scott Rettberg, of the University of Bergen Linguistic, =20=

Literary, and Aesthetic department=92s Digital Culture Group, will be =20=

the Project Leader. The total budget for the project as a whole will =20
be just under 1.000.000 Euros.

=93Electronic Literature as a Model of Creativity and Innovation in =20
Practice=94 (ELMCIP) is a 3-year collaborative research project which =20=

will run from 2010-2013.=0B The project will be funded under HERA joint =20=

research project theme: =0B=92Humanities as a Source of Creativity and =20=

Innovation=92.

ELMCIP involves seven European academic research partners and one non-=20=

academic partner who will investigate how creative communities of =20
practitioners form within a transnational and transcultural context =0B=20=

in a globalized and distributed communication environment. Focusing on =20=

the electronic literature community in Europe as a model of networked =20=

creativity and innovation in practice, ELMCIP is intended both to =20
study the formation and interactions of that community and also to =20
further electronic literature research and practice in Europe.

The partners include: The University of Bergen, Norway (PL Scott =20
Rettberg, Co-I Jill Walker Rettberg), the Edinburgh College of Art, =20
Scotland (PI Simon Biggs, Co-I Penny Travlou), Blekinge Institute of =20
Technology, Sweden (PI Maria Engberg, Co-I Talan Memmott), The =20
University of Amsterdam, Netherlands (PI Yra Van Dijk), The University =20=

of Ljubljana, Slovenia (PI Janez Strechovec), The University of =20
Jyv=E4skyl=E4, Finland (PI Raine Koskimaa), and Univerity College =
Falmouth =20
at Dartington, England (PI Jerome Fletcher), and New Media Scotland.

The project will fund three post-docs and one PhD. The positions that =20=

will be advertised include: a 20-month post-doc in electronic =20
literature bibliography at the University of Bergen, a 12-month post-=20
doc focused on electronic literature publication and education at =20
Blekinge Institute of Technology, and a three year PhD in electronic =20
literature and design at the Edinburgh College of Art. The project =20
also funds a three-year post-doc in ethnography of digital culture at =20=

the Edinburgh College of Art (Penny Travlou).

The research outcomes of the project will include: a series of case =20
studies and research papers on electronic literature, a series of =20
public seminars on electronic literature in different cultural =20
contexts, the production of an extensive online knowledge including =20
papers and presentations from the seminars, project information and =20
bibliographic records of works of electronic literature, a workshop on =20=

electronic literature and education and a companion anthology of =20
electronic literature including pedagogical materials, a major =20
international conference, a public exhibition of electronic literature =20=

artworks and performances. All publications resulting from the =20
project, including conference proceedings, exhibition catalog, project =20=

documentation and the DVD anthology, will be made available on an open =20=

access basis.

As the lead partner, the University of Bergen will be responsible for =20=

overall project administration, for research and a seminar on =20
electronic literature communities to take place in 2010, for the =20
production of the project=92s online knowledge base, and for the =20
production of the project=92s final report. UiB=92s share of the project =
=20
budget, pending ESF approval, is 298.625 Euros.

More information, including a website for the project, details of =20
planned public events, and calls for projects and positions associated =20=

with ELMCIP, will be forthcoming soon.

Chris,

Thank you for bringing the discussion on the computer as a medium out of the
confines of the self-reflecting and uncritical love of its own "newness" and
showing how the ideas expounded in it constitute a continuum with earlier
ideas going back for centuries. I have been trying to do that with Jim to no
avail.

Ciao,

Murat

Ursula K Le Guin has accused the Authors Guild of selling authors "down the river" in the Google settlement and has resigned from the US writers' body in protest after almost 40 years' membership.

In a strongly-worded letter of resignation the award-winning science fiction and fantasy author said the Guild's decision to support Google in its plans to digitise millions of books meant she could no longer countenance being a member.

"You decided to deal with the devil, as it were, and have presented your arguments for doing so. I wish I could accept them. I can't," Le Guin wrote. "There are principles involved, above all the whole concept of copyright; and these you have seen fit to abandon to a corporation, on their terms, without a struggle."

there are two types of power. there's power that others confer on you.
and there's your own power and strength as a person and an artist. it's
important to work on the latter. to be able to really enjoy life and
art and pursue new things with passion and intensity. we cultivate the
former at our own risk. what would you rather play? snakes and ladders
or a game where the goal is not so much winning or losing as pursuit of
the meaning of life?

Wise...

the 'game' aspect of the literary is nowhere so evident as in such matters as canon, awards, grants, and so forth. the main rules are know the judges but, first and foremost, validate the world view of the judges. especially the ones with money.

yet, for all that, yes, there are writers/poets who deserve to be widely read and recognized.

art is a rigged game.


but we are always embroiled in both, aren't we? the enigmas of fortune and life.

what's the difference between a scholar reviewing, an academic
reviewing, and a would-be academic reviewing?  one would hope,
nothing.  however, there is a big difference in the  relationship to
literature and to teaching and to source of income/employment.

one of the things that drew me toward criticism and reviewing is that
it is the last bastion of the self-appointed amateur; it is not as
though I can really do philosophy or paint without being an
outsider/never getting "in", but not only can I be a self-appointed
critic, being somewhat outside is good for that.

if reviewing has mostly become a way for less experienced writers --
or those still in school -- to engage more accomplished
writers/published writing and the writing community, aren't reviews
peculiarly anonymous, in that the majority of reviews aren't written
by "names"?

have any reviewers found many blurbs and flap copy / liner notes *not*
to be helpful, or prejudicial, or whatever, even if only because they
are written by "names" and/or the author?

what is the difference between "going negative" -- which has
quasi-political overtones -- and describing what seems to the reviewer
to be bad and giving reasons?

while dogma vs. ambiguity -- maybe it is just a choice, I would rather
have a clear argument to consider -- to investigate by reading and
thinking -- than a pile of grey slush.

I would be really interested in looking at a list of works that don't
belong in any sort of canon, or, perhaps, 20th century - current books
of poetry which shouldn't be considered standard, recognized,
"sacred," or perhaps even be acknowledged.

Poetry must have something in it
that is barbaric, vast and wild.
-- D. Diderot

=20

In the spirit of an experimental and visionary romanticism that links =
closely with the experimental modernisms of where we are right now, =
McClure, Rothenberg and Scalapino will read from and discuss the works =
of acknowledged Romantics and postromantics like Blake, Shelley, Goethe, =
Hugo, Whitman, Dickinson, and Rimbaud, as well as poems of their own in =
the newest and oldest of romantic traditions.  The reading will also =
include works outside of conventional literatures and national =
boundaries, sound poems and non-sense poems, prose poems and visual =
poems, journal poems and fragment poems, outsider poems and aboriginal =
poems, shouted poems and whispered poems.  The evening will let new =
ideas fly from the poems, the audience, and the readers.=20


Michael McClure's next two books are Of Indigo and Saffron from UC =
Press, and Mysteriosos and other poems from New Directions. McClure =
performed on December 8th with The Charles Lloyd Quartet in Los Angeles =
at Disney Hall.

Jerome Rothenberg is the author of over seventy books of his own poetry =
(thirteen from New Directions) and major assemblages of experimental and =
traditional poetry such as Technicians of the Sacred and Poems for the =
Millennium, the third volume of which is a no-holds barred anthology of =
romantic and postromantic poetry.

Leslie Scalapino is the author of thirty books of poetry, fiction, =
essays, and poem-plays, the most recent being: Day Ocean State of Stars' =
Night published by Green Integer; and It's go in horizontal, Selected =
Poems 1974-2006 published by UC Press, Berkeley, 2007.

SEXUAL HEALING: A new play by Jonathan Leaf and produced by Rattapallax. http://www.sexualhealingplay.com

SEXUAL HEALING details the taboo experimentation and practices of a renowned sex researcher who conducted scientific research into human sexuality and oversaw the filming of hundreds of couples having intercourse thousands of times. Intellectually explicit, SEXUAL HEALING spotlights the role sex played in divorce and the disintegration of the family unit. It tells the story of the development of various techniques for sexual arousal, the employment of surrogate wives, impotence and the "reprogramming" of homosexual men, prior to the American Psychological Association's decision to re-classify homosexuality from being a mental disorder. The play includes nudity and adult themes concerning the treating of male sexual dysfunction. -- broadwayworld.com

=93Though Waterhouse evokes experience he does not resort to narrative, =20=

I would be really interested in looking at a list of works that don't
belong in any sort of canon, or, perhaps, 20th century - current books
of poetry which shouldn't be considered standard, recognized,
"sacred," or perhaps even be acknowledged.

Life is too short to read bad literature. That is why we have the canon. Th=
e canon is nothing more or less than what great artists have consistently b=
een influenced by. It is the list of works most have been able to reread wi=
th profit. No conspiacy is needed -- just an understanding of how real soci=
al systems and networks work.=20

I like this - perhaps - my sense is we have given up our power - the means of power - how we get our juice - namely, how we heat ourselves, get water and food to eat - which compromises at the get-go the other power - enjoin life, new things (meetings), passion - though I like the question of meaning of life - which is for me a life of meaning - of meaning here as measuring - and there are many ways, including language.

Yeah, because the canon is ironclad-objective goodness all around.  Nothing biased or politically-motivated there.  Read without question. "Profit" indeed.

Life is too short to read bad literature. That is why we have the canon. The canon is nothing more or less than what great artists have consistently been influenced by. It is the list of works most have been able to reread with profit. No conspiacy is needed -- just an understanding of how real social systems and networks work.

I would be really interested in looking at a list of works that don't
belong in any sort of canon, or, perhaps, 20th century - current books
of poetry which shouldn't be considered standard, recognized,
"sacred," or perhaps even be acknowledged.

I would guess that -- like it or not -- such a list would include pretty much all poetry being written today, for starters. And therefore most of what we all read anyway, i hope.

Has anyone else noticed that when people speak of the current
irrelevancy of poetry, they're using the word "poetry" synonymously with
"the canon and its direct descendants?"

That is simple-minded and naive.

If you get involved in contemporary art of any consequence, you see many
factors at work in the selection process of what gets recognized either via
grants or awards or being taught in the classroom enough to be considered
canonical. And the quality of the work is but one of several considerations.
A relatively small consideration.

Regionalism is always at play, for instance. Work by people who are
connected in the larger cities such as (and especially) New York has its
advantages. Nationalism is also a factor.

'Schools' also have a certain influence above the work simply of
individuals. Because real social systems are indeed *systems* where power is
not simply a matter of the quality of an individual's work but a function of
the coordinated power of the group.

Additionally, we have seen how, in previous eras, the work of very few women
was considered canonical. Their historical exclusion reflects formation of
canon upon social position, not quality of work or "what great artists have
consistently been influenced by".

The operation of "real social systems and networks" is indeed important in
the manufacture of canon. But their operation is predicated less on
disinterested assessment of the quality and relevance of art as it is on the
promotion of those involved in those systems and networks.

And this is just the way of the world, the way of  "real social systems and
networks" and individuals working in them to survive and prosper with their
friends. As Paul Simon said, "A man sees what he wants to see and disregards
the rest."

It takes a special sort of a person to try to approach unknown work and
artists with an open mind. We are used to our art being carefully framed
toward foregone conclusions.

Agredd. And to add... isn't canon constantly being
recast by those (of us) who cast canons?

Gerald Schwartz

Life is too short to read bad literature. That is why we have the canon. The
canon is nothing more or less than what great artists have consistently been
influenced by. It is the list of works most have been able to reread with
profit. No conspiacy is needed -- just an understanding of how real social
systems and networks work.

I would be really interested in looking at a list of works that don't
belong in any sort of canon, or, perhaps, 20th century - current books
of poetry which shouldn't be considered standard, recognized,
"sacred," or perhaps even be acknowledged.

What canon? Are we talking about all the books that Harold Bloom loves? A=
ll
the books that are still regularly taught? All the books that could possi=
bly
be used to furnish clues for the New York Times crossword puzzle?

Take, just for example, the works of the poet F. T. Prince. Are his poems=

part of the canon? I believe his collected is still in print. But I don't=

recall ever seeing his work mentioned outside an essay by Ashbery I read
years ago. Auden admired him, too. He published a pamphlet with New
Directions sixty or seventy years ago, so James Laughlin must've thought =
he

I don't see this at all.  In fact, quite the opposite.  It is both =
canonical texts and highly traditional notions of literature that are =
very often mobilized in defense of, say, literary education in the =
schools.  Accusations or proclamations about the "irrelevance" of poetry =
are much more likely to point to contemporary, innovative, marginal --  =
"weird" -- poetic practices, at least in my experience.  The challenge =
(and the responsibility I feel as an educator), is to argue for and =
demonstrate the relevance of poetry (canonical and not) as a practice in =
the world.  The general public is often ready to hear that Shakespeare =
or Keats or Yeats are "relevant" in an old-fashioned kind of way; Susan =
Howe or Nate Mackey or Kevin Davies or Kasey Mohammad....not so much.  =
I, of course, seek to demonstrate the relevance of such poets in many of =
my courses; but that is a persuasive challenge very different from what =
I face when I teach a course on the Romantics, for instance.
=20
On a side-note, but related to a practical sense of how/why canonicity =
is perpetuated. When I was teaching in Chicago, I worked with a suburban =
highschool on a program to incorporate poetry into their curriculum.  =
This was a high school in a wealthy suburb with a real desire to do =
something along these lines; they even have (had?) a full-time faculty =
member whose entire job revolved around their poetry-performance groups, =
much like a varsity coach.  So, they had the resources and the will.  =
What they didn't have was the time.  Even the most interested teachers =
are seriously constrained because of the pressures of testing and =
assessment.  If they teach poetry at all, which even the best/most =
committed rarely do, it is most often as an easily digestible kernel =
related to a thematic/historical unit.  It took us forever just to =
manipulate the schedule in such a way as to dedicate 1 day to poetry as =
such.  In these circumstances, it's much easier for a teacher to turn to =
the "tried and true" -- easier to persuade administrators, parents, =
students, even themselves.  I was astonished to see the effects of =
testing pressures on the curriculum, and disheartened.  These teachers =
were good, smart, committed people who simply have no time in the day.  =
It felt like a different planet from when I was in school.  My sense of =
poetry was fundamentally shaped by the experience of reading a lot of =
Gary Snyder in my middle-school English class -- it stuck with me partly =
because I grew up in Southern Oregon and I knew those mountains and =
forests, my grandfather was a logger in many of the same areas Snyder =
worked, and I hunted elk and deer in those same valleys.  So, to me, =
poetry was a part of, a means of knowing that place. I would like to =
think that students today have similar opportunities, but they rarely =
do. If they don't have the chance to see poetry as an activity in the =
world, they are left to think they should know it (if indeed they =
should) just because it's something they should know...it might be on =
the test.
=20
Ok, now I'm depressing myself.

Musings and Involuntaries 1.6
January 21 . January 23 at 8:00pm, January 24 at 3:00pm
Post show discussion moderated by Nancy Dalva on January 21st

The efforts of Foofwa d'Imobilite and collaborators Alan Sondheim and
Azure Carter result in Involuntaries 1.6, a world premiere that saunters
along the edge of reason. The US premiere, Musings, is a collaboration
with lighting designer Jonathan O.Hear and reflects on the ideas of icons;
John Cage and the late Merce Cunningham. The performance will also include
the screening of videos by Foofwa d'Imobilite and Alan Sondheim.

Musings should have been a duet and will bear the mark and weight of
absences, hence its subtitle: "solitary duet." The piece is structured in
a succession of several "musings," separated by nothingness.

The title implies the notions of "daydreams," "meditations," "reflec-
tions," "studies" and "introspections." Each "musing" includes a moment of
meditative study around some of Merce Cunningham.s and John Cage's ideas -
independence of dance and music, using chance as a way to make artistic
decisions and Zen Buddhist philosophy applied to theatrical art = adding a
curious and lively look to it. - Foofwa d'Imobilite

Alan Sondheim


For the DNA performance, we are screening several videotapes illustrating
body performance in real and virtual worlds.

One of the things that has been most important for us has been the bridges
between "real" and "virtual" worlds. The two are intertwined, and I
believe that the "real" body is a cultural production, virtual in a way as
well. Foofwa moves among any number of worlds, as do my avatars and online
work; at times it is difficult to know where virtual worlds begin and the
real ones (for there are more than one) end. We have been able to explore
these issues, as well as those of "technological" and "natural" movements,
consistently throughout our projects.



Foofwa d'Imobilite

Born Fredric Gafner in Geneva in 1969 from parents in dance and
photography, Foofwa d'Imobilite studied at the Ecole de Danse de Genve and
was a member of the Geneva-based Ballet Junior. He danced professionally
with the Stuttgart Ballet in Germany (1987-1990) and with the Merce
Cunningham Dance Company, in New-York (1991-1998). In 1998, he started his
own work with solos and duets. Basing himself in Geneva, he founded
Neopost Ahrrrt in 2000 and created : Media Vice Versa (2002), on media and
digital images, Perform.dancerun.2 (2003), on the relations between dance
and sport, and Injuria (2004), on the precariousness of dancers.
conditions. He collaborated on three pieces with French choreographer
Thomas Lebrun: Le Show (2001), Un-Twomen-Show (2004) and MIMESIX (2005)
and toured throughout Europe with them. He created also Benjamin de
Bouillis (2005), a solo about out-of-body experiences, Live & Dance,
(2005) a piece for 8 dancers or non-dancers, Incidences (2006), a
multi-media and indeterminate piece about rituals and primitivity,
BodyToys (2007), a trio about the manipulated bodies of the entertainment
business, and The Making of Spectacles (2008), a quartet asking the
audience to construct the dance by voting in a public, democratic process.
Foofwa made numerous dance videos and collaborated with artists such as
Alan Sondheim, Nicolas Rieben, Christian Marclay and Antoine Lengo and has
had large group pieces commisioned by the Nederlands Dans Theater 2, the
Bern Ballet and the Ballet Junior. He won several international dance
competitions, among them, a bronze medal at the 1986 International Dance
Competition in Jackson, Mississipi, a 1987 Prix Professionnel at the Prix
de Lausanne, a 1995 New York Bessie Award and the 2006 Swiss Prize for
dance and choreography. He is a recepient of a 1999 Swiss-based Fondation
Leenaards cultural grant, and a 2009 individual grant from the New
York-based Foundation for Contemporary Arts.

A couple of things to take issue with here, or at least to propose amendments.

Although we most of us have lists of contemporary poets we tend to
follow or return to, canons are really about the past, and, whatever
their other costs and benefits, a necessity for the classroom, since
there's only so much time. It's not a bad idea for students to learn
what's been considered important, no matter how the list was
compiled. As long as it's understood that the syllabus is a starting
point--for those interested the Countess of Pembroke should lead to
her brother Phillip Sidney and vice versa.


>Regionalism is always at play, for instance. Work by people who are

>its advantages. Nationalism is also a factor.

It depends on a canon of what, and also what's meant by "in the
larger cities." Large cities have been centers of everything except
farm production until very recently, and those interested in careers
in or education about poetry or the company of poets have tended to
congregate in them. So, the New York School was a gathering of poets
from elsewhere who would have had a hard time connecting with each
other if they'd stayed at home. The internet is changing this, and in
the US the academicization of poetry and, increasingly, poetry
publishing, has meant increasing decentralization.

It's worth remembering that a lot of the regionalists have spent long
periods living outside their regions. Faulkner isn't unique in his
generation for staying close to home, but almost so. Quintessentially
midwestern writers like Hamlin Garland, Willa Cather and Mark
Twain  lived and wrote in Boston and New York. Has anybody
investigated the influence of the city on their work?

Whatever form canons take, they need to evolve, and we've seen this
happening. We've also seen the formation of parallel canons (this is
primarily a US phenomenon), probably a good thing except that
increasingly it has meant mutual exclusion: students tend to learn
one and not the other.

One educational benefits of canons has been that poetry difficult
because the culture and the language have changed has continued to be
taught. Otherwise few students would have the chance to learn from
Shakespeare, Milton, Donne, etc.

Presumably you can't "discover" them without "reading" them. Are there,
then, two kinds of "reading"? Would you explain the difference please?

I would be really interested in looking at a list of works that don't
belong in any sort of canon, or, perhaps, 20th century - current books
of poetry which shouldn't be considered standard, recognized,

that has been discussed. I do know and I have read that the canon is consid=

a freshman college comp. professor who wrote about how his students lack so=

bout Thoreau when I=A0started as=A0a=A0first year=A0in college student, alt=

problem is simply that our students don't read enough unless they are told =

I have stayed away from science fiction, simply because it did not sound ve=

A couple of things to take issue with here, or at least to propose amendmen=
ts.

At 04:13 AM 1/6/2010, you wrote:

 The canon is nothing more or less than what great artists have consistentl=
y been influenced by. It is the list of works most have been able to reread=
 with profit. No conspiacy is needed -- just an understanding of how real s=
ocial systems and networks work.

factors at work in the selection process of what gets recognized either via=
 grants or awards or being taught in the classroom enough to be considered =
canonical. And the quality of the work is but one of several considerations=
. A relatively small consideration.

Although we most of us have lists of contemporary poets we tend to follow o=
r return to, canons are really about the past, and, whatever their other co=
sts and benefits, a necessity for the classroom, since there's only so much=
 time. It's not a bad idea for students to learn what's been considered imp=
ortant, no matter how the list was compiled. As long as it's understood tha=
t the syllabus is a starting point--for those interested the Countess of Pe=
mbroke should lead to her brother Phillip Sidney and vice versa.


> Regionalism is always at play, for instance. Work by people who are conne=
cted in the larger cities such as (and especially) New York has its advanta=
ges. Nationalism is also a factor.

It depends on a canon of what, and also what's meant by "in the larger citi=
es." Large cities have been centers of everything except farm production un=
til very recently, and those interested in careers in or education about po=
etry or the company of poets have tended to congregate in them. So, the New=
 York School was a gathering of poets from elsewhere who would have had a h=
ard time connecting with each other if they'd stayed at home. The internet =
is changing this, and in the US the academicization of poetry and, increasi=
ngly, poetry publishing, has meant increasing decentralization.

It's worth remembering that a lot of the regionalists have spent long perio=
ds living outside their regions. Faulkner isn't unique in his generation fo=
r staying close to home, but almost so. Quintessentially midwestern writers=
 like Hamlin Garland, Willa Cather and Mark Twain=A0 lived and wrote in Bos=
ton and New York. Has anybody investigated the influence of the city on the=
ir work?


> 'Schools' also have a certain influence above the work simply of individu=
als. Because real social systems are indeed *systems* where power is not si=
mply a matter of the quality of an individual's work but a function of the =
coordinated power of the group.
>=20
> Additionally, we have seen how, in previous eras, the work of very few wo=
men was considered canonical. Their historical exclusion reflects formation=
 of canon upon social position, not quality of work or "what great artists =

Whatever form canons take, they need to evolve, and we've seen this happeni=
ng. We've also seen the formation of parallel canons (this is primarily a U=
S phenomenon), probably a good thing except that increasingly it has meant =
mutual exclusion: students tend to learn one and not the other.

One educational benefits of canons has been that poetry difficult because t=
he culture and the language have changed has continued to be taught. Otherw=

I think that the idea of a canon exists so that the humanities can create a
coherent narrative of literature to teach college students--it's an academic
creation that unfortunately simplifies and smooths out what is actually
complicated and sticky. And so works that fit into that narrative, whatever
narrative it might be, get put there. I guess it's necessary to simplify for
academic purposes, but the trouble is that academia sometimes forgets to
tell students that this is just one story, one way of understanding things,
and that there are infinite ways that any particular story can be told.

I went to a fairly conservative college that taught a "western civilization"
course where we read Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, romantic poets, Stephen
Crane, All Quiet on the Western Front, Edith Wharton, some Camus, some
Kafka, and strangely, Barbara Kingsolver. Obviously, tons of things were
left out, but what was put there was put specifically to tell a particular
story about Western culture and the progression from a Christian-based
worldview to a postmodern worldview (with romanticism, positivism,
existentialism, and a dash of civil rights movement lit in between). We
didn't read anything more "experimental" than a James Joyce short story and
glbt work, as well as most feminist and African American lit, were
completely left out. After T.S. Eliot, poetry was pretty much irrelevant.
Those kinds of books didn't fit the neat narrative that was being told.

But now I think those ideas of the canon are pretty much dead outside of
universities. Now each particular school of lit or genre of writing has its
own canon of "books you have to read" in order to be a real
whatever-it-is-you-are-trying-to-be.

yes, in classrooms there is only so much time and grant committees only have
so much money and, generally, decisions need to be made.

but let's not pretend that they are selections of 'the best' artists. that's
insufferable hogwash. it negates what it affirms: any notion of quality in
thinking or art.

not that that's your claim, Mark. i agree with you that canon arise out of
the finitude of time and resources and the necessity to make selections and
justify them.

but they are usually accompanied with rhetoric of bestness. which is
pernicious nonsense that masks reality rather than uncovering it.

bestness of canon is a gamey cloak (win/lose) over the veil of illusion.

Nope.  That could apply to a lot of minor, interesting, worthy writers --
say Edgell Rickworth or Norman Cameron [who, come to think of it, would be a
better candidate for any canon that thought of getting round to including
F.T.Prince].

<<
 If it isn't, is it enough to get him on the
anti-canon list? If not, why?
>>

For exactly the reasons that Troy Camplin pointed too, and promptly
generated a whole cascade of vitrol and misunderstandings.

Interesting to see the descriptivist/prescriptivist debate played out yet
once more, with the prescriptivists howling for a revised canon.

(Hell, I'd love to see Anne Bradstreet and Lady Mary Wortly Montague
incorporated as part of the canon, but unfortunately wishing don't make it
so.  Nor even does serious editorial scrutiny, such as Roger Lonsdale
performed.  Or individual poetic enthusiasms, as Berryman did for
Bradstreet.  The bottom line of making the work available is necessary, but
this isn't ever sufficient, even for poets of great merit.)

This is poetry from within an international concrete-typographic tradition
to which it pays respect as a means of placing itself precisely in its own
distinct take on language. Gide said most good writers have their own
specific sense of irony, and that=92s one of the things nick-e melville sho=
ws
in the work here. But by irony is not meant that commonplace smart-arsednes=
s
of British literary middleclass detachment and defence; on the contrary thi=
s
is a way of viewing and engaging that is basic, delicate, and political. =
=97 *Tom
Leonard*



What nick-e melville creates within *selections and dissections *is text as
experience, presenting us with different ways to look at visual language,
different ways to understand the ubiquitous textscapes of daily living. The
pages of this book are filled with games, but games of the most serious
kind, games about the act of being sentient textual beings. Melville, a
textual imagineer, examines the spaces between letters, the negative spaces
between lines of text, and even the halftone atoms of printing, always
looking for the surprise in the printed text. To read this book is to
experience these acts of textual imagination as cinema, as vibrant and
moving sequences of thought. =97 *Geof Huth*

Why
he should be excluded, however, seems to be more obvious to you than to m=

My post was trying to get at an answer to Catherine Daly's --what, I
thought, could an anti-canon list possibly look like? If it excludes writ=

like F. T. Prince or Unica Zurn or John Heywood or William Hope Hodgson o=

Richard Griffin -to make a crazy miscellany- then it must be very long

Good luck with this, Obododimma.  I'll be interested to see how the journal comes together for you.

Cheers,
Scott

p.s. I'll have the rest of your collection published in one or two days.  I've had a health crisis at home to deal with.  My son was in hospital for a week and is now home recovering.

The canon, any canon, is merely a starting point for serious dialogue.
The difficulty is in preventing the canon from becoming an endpoint, that
is, a terminus for dialogue.
The canon consists of markers to the other.
The canon changes depending upon what you wish to speak about and to whom.
Know thy other.
It establishes your bona fides; if you have read (that is, have thought
upon) what you need to have read in order to carry on a dialogue with
someone of your choosing, then you have mastered the necessary canon.
How much you need to have read varies according to interpersonal factors,
and according to the purpose of the dialogue.
Assuming you wish to be taken seriously, experience has proven that it is
quite helpful when you can demonstrate by competent familiarity with the
canon that you are taking the other person in the dialogue seriously.
The dialogue you carry on may be actual, virtual, imaginary, hypothetical,
or solipsistical.
The other may be merely another part of yourself. Taken seriously.
You determine the use value of the canon according to your psychological
desire and capacity for dialogue.
The canon does not exist outside or beyond your willingness to accredit its
value for dialogue.
There is no canon. You are the canon.

I am under the impression that Anne Bradstreet is definitely"in", as
are Marie de France, Sor Juana, and Sappho, of poets.

I think we can remove Tennyson from the list.  But we can't get rid of
all the verse that went out of fashion, can we? .

Can we remove genre fiction?  I've been reading some YA novels in
verse.  The boom in YA lit has led to college age kids moving from
Encyclopedia Brown and whatnot not to canonical works like
Frankenstein or the Brontes or Russian novels, or even to war novels
and genre fiction, but to new commercial fiction written for kids.
And YA novels in verse about hookers, vampires, and drugs.  Parading
as "issues."

But I'm not thinking about some lit survey course or the readings for
comp., courses that no one at a top tier college or university would
have to take anyway; I'm thinking about the list of books which do get
taught in poetry courses.  For example, Adrienne Rich is still "in",
but Galway Kinnell isn't, of books I was taught.  At the same time, I
wonder if Plath, Lowell, Sexton, Berryman have made it in, or if Laux
& Olds are still subbing in as confessionals who didn't commit
suicide.  I still wonder why Dylan Thomas never made it in.  So it is
not really "canon"/

But as for the Prince question, is Laforgue in?  I think not.  So then
not Prince.

so how many folks on this list particularly those involved in this
discussion believe they are or will be part of the canon , please don't
blush and put aside yer egos... - whichever canon we're discussing here
-  yeats keats  li po  lorca  we forget alot of non- english
speaking/writing poets saktaro hagiwara basho  we tend to limit canon to
our particular tastes needs prejudices knowledge and requirements tho of
course there are stalwarts (sp?) within the canon / whatever happend to
merrick gther ye rose buds had to learn that in 5th grade i think it wa
never forgot it been a rock for me to lean upon ditto homer   HEY ROBERT
HOW COME YO NEVER GOT THOSE BOOKS AND CDS from ME speaking of canons the
3 folks you mention have been foisted by academia into the modern canon
where will they/we be in the time - worn cliche scenario a hundred years
from now ????

I've tried to send the announcement below to the list serve previously, but
I didn't see it posted. I'm not sure if it violates a policy of the group,
but I don't think so. In any case, I thought that some of the Illinois- and
Wisconsin-area subscribers might be interested...


THE BATHROOM LAUNCHES CHAPBOOK SERIES WITH TWO MIDWEST READINGS*
*

The Bathroom officially kicks off its first annual Bathroom Reading
Materials series with two outstanding manuscripts by Steve Timm and Ryan
Philip Kulefsky. Both chapbooks are available for free (as in beer) as PDFs

r
chapbooks=92 publication, Kulefsky and Timm will be giving free readings in
Racine, WI (1/30/10) and Chicago, IL (2/2/10), where the 26 signed &
lettered print copies will be available for purchase while supplies last.

The first event is at the Racine Arts
Council<http://www.racineartscouncil.org/>,
Saturday, January 30th 2010. Doors will open at 6:30 and the reading will
start at 7:00. Light refreshments will be served, and the event is free.
(Donations for The Bathroom and the Racine Arts Council gladly accepted!).

The second reading is at Tuesday Funk <http://tuesdayfunk.blogspot.com/> (@

available soon and The Bathroom #6 comes out in February, so check back wit=
h
The Bathroom <http://bathroommagazine.wordpress.com/> in the coming weeks.

Ryan Philip Kulefsky lives in Chicago, IL and holds an MFA from Bard. He
teaches English writing & rhetoric along with literature at Columbia Colleg=

Catherine:

>I am under the impression that Anne Bradstreet is definitely "in" ...

In one sense, in that most (?literate? whatever; poetry reading) people have
at least heard of her.  A revaluation that probably occured in the wake of
Berryman's "Homage to Anne Bradstreet".  But when I was teaching her, as
late as the late eighties, at least, it was much more difficult to give the
students easy access to a reasonably-sized selection of her work than any
comparable writer.  (I used to fit her in as the fourth of the Metaphysical
Poets, after Donne, Marvell, and George Herbert, though I personally think
her work is more interesting than Herbert's.)

But, as far as I know, there still isn't a full-scale annotated edition,
complete with textual discussions, etc.  So OK, this isn't necessary for the
general reader, but it's pretty much necessary as a foundation for a
Reader's Text.

But see:

http://books.google.com/books?id=25frNwTkO6gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=anne+bradstreet&ei=N5NGS-GqGoiGlQSI8fz5DQ&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false
    -- 1867 Edition

http://books.google.com/books?id=eb85OZVGAeUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=anne+bradstreet&ei=N5NGS-GqGoiGlQSI8fz5DQ&cd=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false
    -- 1897

The Internet Archive also has various 19thC editions.  But nothing in
Project Gutenberg, which is beginning to approximate to an Internet Canon,
as the first port of call.

The Brown Corpus of Woman's Writing has (I think) transcribed her poems, but
I'm not sure how available that is.

Then, if you have institutional access to EEBO (or happen on a back door to
it), the best thing would be to look at the original 17thC editions.

But it shouldn't be *necessary to go to that trouble to access a writer of
Bradstreet's worth and importance, and it makes teaching her incredibly more
difficult than it should be.

Basically, if you're seriously interested in canon-busting, you have to get
down and dirty to basic textual editing.  When I started working on what
might be called the canon of English cant poetry a few years ago, I assumed
that some texts would be missing or not easily available.  What I didn't
realise was that I'd have to re-edit *every bloody text I was working with
that was written before maybe 1850.  That's three hundred years ...  And
that included quasi-canonical writers like Thomas Dekker -- once you get
typecast as "writing in cant," it seems that the usual scholarly principles
no longer apply.

And that's *before we get to texts and writers who are ignored, writers who
are misrepresented (the typical dismissive term for cant poetry is to
characterise it as "doggerel"), don't start me ...

As a result, I'm slightly out of sympathy for generalised discussions of the
nature of the canon that don't get down to specifics.  <g>

Best,

Robin

PS --  Lots of interesting points, here, but I've said enough for the
moment.

 this crazy minor writers thing bears thought, as some of the
"different cultures" (Like Dante, Shakey, and Kingsolver) "in english
and not" "race" and "women" writers have been first seen as merely
minor and then who becomes major (but I think Bradstreet does, and
also stands for ever more less culturally and educationally
interesting Puritan writers)

so I wonder who minor white male authors can be the anti canon?  and
who are THEY?

Here's a few thoughts.

Since there have been more things to read than time to read them
there's been a canon. Much of what was in the canon before printing
no longer exists, and if we go back to antiquity what survives is
largely an accident, though it certainly helped a book's chances if
there were more manuscripts to begin with. The canon was somewhat
fixed for a long time, or at least changed very slowly. It's always
been dicey when talking about contemporaries.

Tennyson is very much a part of the canon if one is interested in
Victorian poetry, though not many are. But all of these
determinations are also impacted by the very new--post
WWII--phenomenon of the industrialization of higher education.
There's a Tennyson Industry, a Plath industry, etc., with hundreds or
thousands of employees in each, all with a vested interest in
maintaining the brand name. So canon formation and evolution has been
somewhat distorted.

Canons often consist of works that support the values of a class in
power, but not in detail. They don't have to. Both the Iliad and
pastorals were a part of the canon that an upper class Roman was
supposed to have mastered, and so were Sappho and Ovid, and it's a
stretch to see them as supportive of a narrow set of values. The use
of a canon, regardless of its content, is often to define a class of
people as distinct from other classes of people--the washed have read
it, the unwashed not. If this weren't so those who teach literature
would be out of jobs and universities would teach only skills
directly useful in the job market.

Which has nothing to do with the generally high quality of canonical
works and their usefulness for those of us who write. Hell, anyone
who writes in English should read Pilgrim's Progress, which used to
be in everyone's canon, once Bunyan and his kind were no longer being
routinely arrested. And the same is true for most of what's in anybody's canon.

Best,

Mark

don't always have the time to write thoughtfully... or be terribly coherent.
should have said I read what i consider to be 1st rate.
which implies that the selection has already been made.

same with discover/new writers -- which is mostly from random reading.
i don't discover writers as i might a quarter or wallet on the street.

Presumably you can't "discover" them without "reading" them. Are there,
then, two kinds of "reading"? Would you explain the difference please?

I would be really interested in looking at a list of works that don't
belong in any sort of canon, or, perhaps, 20th century - current books
of poetry which shouldn't be considered standard, recognized,
"sacred," or perhaps even be acknowledged.

signed first edition I am too frightened to break the spine or crimp
pages, but based on what I have read this is a great first collection.

This is what I had hoped future books of queer poetry would be like. I
will stick my neck out and say this is a very important collection of
queer poetry.

I have a hard back copy of Dennis Cooper, Dream Police, along side of
which I will put Deviant Propulsion on my shelves. These two are
important queer poetry, of that I am very confident.

Best wishes, Chris Jones.

I'm looking at a single bookcase in my study... Here's a very brief list of
dead white male authors, most poets, excluded from the official canon but
not from mine:

Ivor Gurney
Thomas Lovell Beddoes
David Schubert
Charles Tennyson (much more interesting than his brother)
F. T. Prince
William Barnes
Walter de la Mare (for a couple dozen poems, as many stories, and the
magnificent MEMOIRS OF A MIDGET)
Edward Dahlberg
James Clarence Mangan
James Thomson (The City of Dreadful Night)
William Morris

I could also add D. H. Lawrence's poetry, which doesn't seem to have made
the cut.

But I guess I'm not really sure who's in and who's out these days... Ralegh?
Campion? Fulke Greville? Crabbe? Gascoigne? D.G. Rossetti? All in my canon!

This really gets to a central issue. There really is no official
canon, except in schools organized around Great Books. A canon may be
what gets taught  schoolroom, or it might be what's included in the
standard histories of literature. Parse it further. Taught to whom in
the schoolroom? Is the canon what gets taught in survey classes? In
which case it's a pretty small lot, often selected primarily for
"relevance" and perceived teachability. If it's what's taught to
those specializing in contemporary in universities that no longer
expect much education beyond the field it's pretty limited. For those
in older fields Beddoes, de la Mare, Mangan, Thomson and Morris are
very much in the canon, tho less prominently than some of their
contemporaries, as, for instance, Surrey is in comparison to Wyatt.
The others have cults of devoted readers or are read, like Dahlerg,
as much for their associations as for themselves.

In an earlier post I spoke of the canon as a device for separating
the washed from the unwashed. That sort of canon is supposed to be
limited, and it includes none of these. But there's also the canon
that curious readers know they will never fully master and that
serves as a jumping-off point for still wider reading. A love of
Shakespeare's plays leads to seeking out his predecessors,
contemporaries and those who came after, at least into the 18th
century, not all of whom were in that initial canon, tho they may
once have been (everybody should read Thomas Otway, for instance).
Maybe another way to conceive it is that a canon is the beginning of
a body of knowledge.

Best,

Mark

> What gives you the impression that I haven't read McLuhan?

Thanks for this reply and apologies for delayed response. Like a lot of
artists toward the ends of a large project I seem to overwork. However
your response is interesting. Part of my wish was to put my foot down on
the rhetorical gas pedal since rhetoric is what you seemed to be putting
forward which addressed me as a reader presumed ignorant of technology
rather the more concrete arguments in this latest post. If you read back
perhaps you may see how I could readily read this as an hostile attack,
and hence also my response.

My other concern is that simply claiming McLuhan as a supporter of
computer based interactive art doesn't seem to fit in with McLuhan's
writings since he is hostile to technology and says as much; opposed to
change and opposed to technology. If we follow his writings The
Mechanical Bride lays out a Leavisite reading of technology as a student
of FR Leavis. This gets further developed into notions such as
anti-environment which includes use of a method from Bergson and
readings of Freud on the unconscious and dreams. Again this will take us
back to early Kant and the claim that the pure empty form of space is
sufficient ground for art. For computer art, or any recent arts which
work with some technique or idea of interaction and feedback this is not
reality since space is already completely saturated with media images.
This is also a problem which arises if interaction is seen as what is
already given as different. Another problem that arises is that time
then becomes elided into space the way it does with Hegel which
effectively short circuits sensations and the aesthetic potential of
interactivity. What gets left out is art. For that reason my main
argument is that we need to begin with art first and like most artists,
this requires study and thinking art which includes art history, of
course.

The other problem with thinking computer art as essentially interaction
which sets up this pure empty form and using a defence of enigma and
mystery is it ignores the saturation of rhetorical links which pose
interaction as the body of women upon which programming and interaction
takes place. This is the exchange of women which not only supports
misogynist rape fantasy but also is a universalising force which
structures homophobia. For art today this is vital for historic reasons.

The other problem with only interaction is it ignores what can be done
with application of photographic textures in various graphics apps such
as Blender (and from what I understand, Mayo, although I have not used
Mayo.) This cannot be done any other way. The question of doubling and
interaction is another problem that is also something recent art
encounters and to exclude it on mechanical grounds avoids interacting
with the solutions it may offer. Another problem with interaction
appears when it gets reduced to computer interaction only as a category
or productive faculty in which case this would make computer art
impossible.

My own solution to the problem of intervening in a saturated media
environment is absolute deviation which places us inside time, but I
don't expect others to follow this. With best wishes, Chris Jones.

I didn't claim McLuhan was "a supporter of computer based interactive art".
I brought him up concerning the importance of understanding media. Computer
based interactive art existed when he was alive, but not with the prominence
it has now. It is something that mainly comes after McLuhan, though many of
his writings are relevant to the effects of computer media, which is partly
why he is still as widely read as he is.

Your other point also is off. To characterize McLuhan as "opposed to change
and opposed to technology" is simplistic. He was ambivalent about the
effects of electronic media. He realized that it brings big changes to the
way we perceive and think about ourselves and the world. It changes our
notion of literacy. But he also saw some advantages to technologies. As to
being "opposed to change", well, we all resist it, to a certain extent, but
we recognize it is better to bend than to break in the wind. Same with
McLuhan.

Don't start with anything first. Look at what is in front of your nose and
go from there.

Again, I have no idea what this means, Chris. You're packing too much into
each sentence.

I think you mean Maya. Mayo is a condiment. Maya is software for creating 3D
figures.

Interactive work can use Maya, ie, interactive work can use 3D figures.
Computer games use a lot of them.

Again, Chris, this requires a great deal of unpacking.

Interactive work is time-based. Yet, in our minds, we go back and forth in
time, typically, in non-linear ways.

One Armed Man Productions Newsletter

[http://cts.vresp.com/c/?OneArmedManInc./e67b5afd00/TEST/5daf2e0123]


Next Wednesday, as part of Subjective Theatre Company's Play Reading
Series, One Armed Man will be assistant co-producer of Joel Chace's
Fundamentalism, a racy meditation on lust, self-knowledge and the
fundamentals of perception on January 13, 2010 at 7pm at Under St.
Marks (94 St. Marks Place). Admission is FREE, and seating is general
admission at the door.

In Fundamentalism, a woman picks up a man in a bar for a one night
stand, and she finds an ex-boyfriend - and his new lover - in her
house. Sexual couplings and triplings ensue, until the man who
stumbled into the free-for-all discovers that the three strangers have
been sent on a highly lucrative mission to derail his life and alter
his perceptions.

The cast includes Dan Cozzens, Sarah Koestner, Chris Keogh, Yesim Ak
and Diana Sheivprasad.

I first met playwright Joel Chace when his play Triptych was presented
in Amphibian Productions' play reading series at Manhattan's ArcLight
Theatre in April 2004. Triptych told the story with continuous action
on a stage divided into thirds, and I was immediately impressed with
his unique vision, sense of experimentation and imaginative use of a
stage. Fundamentalism will be his second play to receive a staged
reading. =A0Although primarily renowned as a poet, he also is a
playwright to watch. His other plays include To the Thieves and
Decorative Hermits.

As a poet, Chace has been published in 6ix, Tomorrow, Lost and Found
Times, Coracle, xStream, and Jacket. For many years, Chace has been
Poetry Editor for the experimental electronic magazine 5_Trope.

This is the first reading that I will be directing since my production
of the Mark Twain docudrama The Report of My Death, which recently
premiered aboard the Steamship Lilac last summer. And this is the
first time my theater company One Armed Man has collaborated with The
Subjective Theatre
Company, whose mission follows the legacy of Joe Papp: To produce
politically and socially relevant theatre for at no cost to the
public.

We hope to see you at the show.

All my best,

Adam Klasfeld
Artistic Director, One Armed Man

Archive Index Text


here's a list of all the digital work I have done online from 1994-pres-
ent, in tree form, assembled for archiving. it also includes files from my
collaborations (with Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure Carter, others), and
various other files, texts, etc. it's longer than I thought it would be.

http://www.alansondheim.org/archex.txt
http://www.alansondheim.org/archelim.txt (gross eliminate of duplicate
names)

2000-3000 videos (different)
28000 images (around, different)
900 sound/music (different)
1400 texts, programs, digital obj files etc. (different)

it's weirdly interesting. it doesn't include iso files, Second Life full
.avi video files, personal stuff. it runs about 830 gigabytes, would be
larger w/ the additions.

Marcel Duchamp Interviewed by Russell Connor
Museum of Fine Arts Boston in association with WGBH-TV
1964, 29:02 min, b&w, sound

Russell Connor interviews Marcel Duchamp on the occasion of the Boston Museum of Fine Art's exhibition of the work of Duchamp's brother, "Impressionist-Cubist" Jacques Villon (formerly Gaston Duchamp). Connor first introduces paintings, etchings, sculpture and lithographs by Villon, and is then joined by Duchamp, who discusses Villon's work and contributes his thoughts on art in general. This fascinating document gives the viewer a rare opportunity to hear the legendary Dadaist as he reveals observations on the state of art in the 1960's.


Presented by Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in association with WGBH-TV, Boston and the Livell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council. Director: Allan Hinderstein. Lighting Director: Linda Beth Hepler. Video: Al Potter. Audio: Will Morton. Recordist: Pat Kane. Associate Producer: Thalia Kennedy. Executive Producer: Patricea Barnard.

the threat and promise of virtualization is that its nature will have

Here is a writer/artist who is thinking about the nature of the internet as
a medium and its relation to the "human." Jim, Alan's statement is fully
relevant to the question I raised about "the spiritual life of replicant,"
an issue you found technically too far into the future, therefore, not wort=
h
discussion or dealing with -whereas, as Alan's observation implies, the
relation of the human to the machine, in this specific case to the virtual,
is something full of relevance to our present condition.

I've been blogging on dementia this past week, and will return to literary
endeavors soon on http://tinfisheditor.blogspot.com

aloha, Susan

Xerolage 44 - "proviles encouragolage" by musicmaster

from the introduction:

Now, I=92d like to say you=92re seeing the results of my one-day art
binge, of my subjugation to the shackles of art rules, art impulses,
art battles =96 the pretty angel on my left shoulder whispering Make
something nice and upbeat, it doesn=92t have to contain bad language or
crazy lines, and the little red devil on my right shoulder whispering
Buy her a drink and shut her up; if she knew what she was talking
about she wouldn=92t be working for you. I=92d like to say you=92re holding
proof that I=92m mad. But alas, that=92s not the case. Only 21 pages of
this publication contain content written/drawn/mutated on April 1st,
so technically I might be 64% mad. Originally I had 24 pages wrapped
and emailed to mIEKAL on April 2 after scanning and positioning a few
pieces I finished before midnight on the 1st. But then mIEKAL replied
that I was supposed to do 28 pages and in black & white only. Of
course I had forgotten. When I had agreed to the task in October, my
mind was basking in the idea of the vacation time I had allowed my
self during the 1000 Drawings project. Remember? Sure you do. But how
can one remember all the days of the week when so many are named the
same! How can this wretch be expected to know that in the
anything-possible-world-of-visual-poetry and calamitous invention that
page count is thuggish and that black & white is colorless?

So I sighed about failing to do Xerolage 44 on one day and figured
hell, I=92ll go nuts for real, which equals 64% mad, and spend a few
more days tidying up where I=92d rushed things and adding 4 more pages.
I don=92t know to whom I apologize for not meeting the unnecessary
challenge (except to mIEKAL who should be thankful I=92m not apologizing
for considerably more), but I=92m sorry that I didn=92t. I wanted at least
the ridiculous part of the great idea to have credibility.

I'm looking at a single bookcase in my study... Here's a very brief list of
dead white male authors, most poets, excluded from the official canon but
not from mine:

Ivor Gurney
Thomas Lovell Beddoes
David Schubert
Charles Tennyson (much more interesting than his brother)
F. T. Prince
William Barnes
Walter de la Mare (for a couple dozen poems, as many stories, and the
magnificent MEMOIRS OF A MIDGET)
Edward Dahlberg
James Clarence Mangan
James Thomson (The City of Dreadful Night)
William Morris

I could also add D. H. Lawrence's poetry, which doesn't seem to have made
the cut.

But I guess I'm not really sure who's in and who's out these days... Ralegh?
Campion? Fulke Greville? Crabbe? Gascoigne? D.G. Rossetti? All in my canon!

Xerolage 45 - "d wwhy dddd EElio" by Andy Martrich

from the introduction:

d wwhy dddd EElio initially began as a stencil project=97 taking the
shape of The Waste Land as governed by each page of the 75th
Anniversary Harvest Book Edition and using it to carve content from
online essays, analysis, cheat sheets, comment streams, copyright
information, etc. This was done as an exploration into Creeley and
Olson=92s idea that =93form is never more than an extension of content=94
=97an inquiry into the privileging of content over context. This
opposition is particularly noticeable in digital recreations of
writing where form is completely disregarded as an inessential side
effect of content (as in The Waste Land at Project Gutenberg, where
the original shape of the poem is distorted, or as with Kindle, which
houses the content of a novel regardless of whether its content was
created specifically for the context of the book-form).

    d wwhy dddd EElio leaves Eliot=92s The Waste Land in the last
century, for this, as a communion of working artists, we are most
grateful and filled with glee. On this rubble Andy Martrich builds a
new proposal using the frame of the page as a unit of composition, all
angular as the culture of the computer suggests, and it is in the
frames of this narrative concrete poetry that our living poetry
manifests. His geometric forms veil and obliterate our heritage yet
acknowledge that our poetry is derivative. It is a derivation,
however, that refuses repeating the successes of thepast and the
past=92s failures. As an emergence in our time, the poetry becomes an
alive art by involving our common mass language and the languages of
mass advertising and information delivery. Martrich, the poet, expends
this harvest to include pictures. As we read all the world today
everywhere images are a facet of our dictionary. They are read like
the letters of the alphabet and they are literary aural images. The
poet says, read. I read: go beyond and underneath and above our
mundane flatness. The Waste Land, as much as it is at times a worthy
monument, is here washed, cleansed, and forgiven, and now as literary
molecule matriculates with Andy Martrich literary intelligence into a
poetry that is a procession into our future poetry, the wish land.

    =97Michael Basinski

    Brothers and sisters, is there hope for the up-to-the-eyeballs
deluge of lit-crit detritus that attends a pedagogical work-horse like
The Waste Land?  And for that matter, is there hope for the iconic
poem itself? Believe it or not, yes.  But only as meta-critically
repurposed by visual poet Andy Martrich, whose ecological intervention
into the trashbin of Waste-Landia transforms it into swirling,
primitive letter-scapes that return language to the grimy, inventive
freshness it deserves.  Reborn from a conservative bastion of pulpitry
into a vibrating field of shapes, images and implied sounds, this poem
lives again in the undoing of its =93character armor.=94

    =97Maria Damon

    Martrich graciously guides us thru the 'apocalypse' of the
book-object in its supposed death throes=97historically savvy,
absolutely contemporary, the lesson is that there is energy in what we
thought was leaving, that fewer things are dead than we might think. A
familiar investigation is suddenly invigorated, & we are fortunate
enough to be along for a ride which is at turns elegant, radiant,
occasionally grotesque & always entertaining.

In the future, presuming there will be a future, programmerly works of net
art that need artificial intelligence will get feeds from web services that
offer different types of intelligence. A web service is such that you send

We can see a bit of this already in the chat bots that chat with you (see
http://www.google.ca/search?q=chat+bots ). Some of these support
customization, and advertise that you can customize the 'personality' of the
chat bot for your site. The idea is that the chat bot is
something/(somebody) on your web site. The 'brain' of the bot is via a feed
from the chat bot company. The 'personality' is via custom files stored on
your site.

We can generalize this to imagine an artificial intelligence cobbled
together from multiple feeds from multiple companies offering different
types of intelligence. Perhaps one feed is for detecting allusion in user
remarks. Perhaps another is for accessing a database of poetry. Yet another
may offer ontologies. Perhaps another is to let the bot play chess with the
user while they chat. And so forth.

We can generalize this further to observe that web services can be not just
for getting intelligence feeds, but feeds of all sorts. dbCinema uses Google
image search. That is a web service. The user types stuff into dbCinema;
dbCinema sends that stuff to Google image search, and gets back a list of
URLs of images somehow related to what the user typed in.

This is 'intelligence' in a broad sense, like spooks use the word. Future
programmerly works of net art will use feeds to gather intelligence from
around the net that let the work of art respond meaningfully to the user.

But, of course, this is not the be-all-and-end-all of computer art. For the
life of art is not so much in artificial intelligence or artificial life as
in the liveliness we associate with art.

And that liveliness is not so much a matter of autonomous intelligence, on
the part of the work of art, as it is in engaging the liveliness of the
audience. The life of art is in this double liveliness: its and ours.

This may be a bit off-topic. I have a soft spot for Lawrence's poetry
and short stories. But I really find it hard to look past his
misogyny, repellent racism and straight-out bizarre ideas about
sexuality. His novels are infuriating: he can turn in the space of one
sentence from genius lyricism to some of the worst badfic I've ever
read between covers. A man of great talent, I think, and a wonderful
writer of landscape, but he had almost no taste at all.

Today we release episode 27 of the PoemTalk series. Jeffrey Robinson,
Charles Bernstein, Jerome Rothenberg and I discuss Robert Duncan's
poem, "Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow," which served as
the prologue-poem to Duncan's 1960 book, The Opening of the Field.

Comrade poet!

Since Parliament has been prorogued, you're probably just sitting on your
hands, bereft. But things are looking up!

Canadian poets are invited to submit a poem for consideration for a new
anthology to be published by Mansfield Press just in time for the
reconvening of Parliament
on March 3.

The collection is titled Rogue Stimulus: The Stephen Harper Holiday
Anthology for a Prorogued Parliament. We're looking for poems of up to 75
lines: your tender musings on Stephen Harper.

We have to move fast. The deadline is midnight on Tuesday, January 19.
Payment for your contribution is one copy of the anthology. It's gonna look
good and it's gonna be full of good poems.

The editors of Rogue Stimulus are Ottawa poet Stephen Brockwell and
Toronto/Cobourg poet Stuart Ross. Denis De Klerck, publisher of Toronto
literary house Mansfield Press, is oiling up the machinery for quick action,
to ensure the anthology's timely release.

Please email your poem (preferably as a Word attachment) to:
harper@mansfieldpress.net

We look forward to hearing from you.

Stephen and Stuart

Amy, if you're interested & if it's related to what you're thinking
about there have been a number of studies and articles published in
the Chronicle about how few women there are after the Associate
Professor level - here's one: Not Moving On Up: Why Women Get Stuck at
Associate Professor
(http://chronicle.com/article/Not-Moving-On-Up-Why-Women/47213). Here
at CU Boulder is stunning, really, miniscule percentage of women at
the higher levels.

yes, it's a national problem in academia. a clear signal that women are
considered service horses and not true scholars worthy of compensation
for their intellectual labor.

Hi--

You might be interested in looking at the report from MLA "Standing Still: =
The Associate Professor Survey"- published in the last _Profession_ -it =
looks into why women don't move out of the associate level as fast as men. =
Some of the main reasons were many more hours spent in child-care, poor =
mentoring, and more time spent grading, mentoring students (nurturing), =
etc.=20

Gerald,

Good question. Black Mountain was influenced greatly by the breakthroughs in science (quantum physics, field theory) that have not yet fully manifested in culture. Though this science is an evolution from the mechanistic, mainstream culture is, by and large, still there. In fact, the actions of the Bush administration (preemptive war/Guantanamo/Abu Ghraib, &c) and the Obama administration's extension of much of that approach indicate that we're more mechanistic than ever.

The possibilities of Projective Verse have not fully been explored, although Michael McClure and Nate Mackey seem to be the main ones (most popular anyway) utilizing that method. Although I see little on this list about McClure's use of the method.

I wonder how much living in such a pervasive hyper-capitalist and Industry-Generated-Culture addles engagement with a writing method that involves

the HEAD, by way of the EAR, to the SYLLABLE and especially
the HEART, by way of the BREATH, to the LINE

as well as "a use of speech at its least careless and least logical."

When practiced for a long enough time, this method does lead one to a deeper "stance toward reality" that is likely world-centric.

The Tools of the Sacred conference this May in Brussels will likely get into some of this.http://www.ulb.ac.be/philo/dll/colloques/tools_of_the_sacred/

Ciao,

Paul

P.S. Anyone go to the McClure, Rothenberg, Scalapino reading at City Lights last night?

An Irish poet and his lady will be visiting New York March 13 to 21
and are looking for a place to stay. Totally reliable. Anybody going
to be out of town and willing to rent to them? Totally reliable.
Please b/c and I'll give details.

Very sad news to report: the Baltimore poet David Franks was found dead in
his Fells Point apartment early Thursday, after his brother had been unable
to contact him over the previous two days.  In recent years, David=B9s health
had declined due to his battle with cancer and other complications. A cause
of death has not been released at this point.

David was a much-loved figure in the Baltimore poetry scene for his amazing
public performances and readings, as well as his unwavering support of the
writing community and the work of younger poets. A memorial service is in
the works and will be posted to this list.

Thanks.

Ruth,

McClure's introduction to his book Three Poems is the best statement about PV since the actual essay, now 60 years old. (Copies available here: http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=McClure&sts=t&tn=Three+Poems&x=38&y=14)

Jeffrey Side was kind enough to publish my essay on McClure on the Argotist website: http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Nelson%20essay.htm

I am working on something for the Brussels conference as well.

But Olson used Alfred North Whitehead's work as a prime source. Robin Blaser's essay "The Violets" and Shahar Bram's book, written in Hebrew and translated into English, is an excellent source: "Charles Olson and Alfred North Whitehead: An Essay on Poetry."


William Carlos Williams hinted at how Field Theory should be applied to poetry in 1948 ("The Poem as a Field of Action") and, of course, there's Duncan's "The Opening of the Field."

WCW was searching for a new measure throughout his life. I think "The Variable Foot" was a kind of awkward attempt to state the notion that, after Einstein's Theory of Relativity, a more relative (open) approach to structuring the poetic line was necessary. Olson sub-titled Projective Verse "Composition by Field" and while that applies to the page itself, the field of composition being much like the canvas of a Pollock painting, it also relates to the fields of energy one enacts as they write projectively. Olson said the process leads to "dimensions larger than the man."

I think one aspect of quantum physics which is most interesting to contemplate as we see that line, is the notion of "non-locality." What is MIND? Is it brain, or does it extend, in prayer for example, from Seattle (my location) to Haiti, or to Reading, Brussels, New Zealand, Cuba, Mars? If mind is non-local, then we ARE connected as one organism, making war akin to shooting at yr foot.

McClure was influenced greatly by the Hua Yen school of Buddhism, which predates Whitehead by quite a bit, but is quite similar. (Some scholars trace Whitehead's ideas back to ancient China.) With Olson, inspired by Whitehead, reality is deeper than objects. It is an "occasion of experience." Train yourself to fully immerse your consciousness in that occasion of experience and revision is unnecessary. Perhaps some fine-tuning as Gary Snyder put it, but there is intelligence in the language of the moment that supersedes the individual ego.

Francis Cook's "The Jewel Net of Indra" helps get these points across.

Also, more here: http://organicpoetry.org/essays.html

Thanks for asking.

That was fast! Many thanks, Paul, & I--and am sure others--will read all
this with care.
Best,
Ruth
I have The Jewel Net. Was used to thinking of McClure's sound poems
primarily. Olson & Whitehead, huh. Relation to non-revision interesting--of
course it makes sense.

I would venture that the temper of the time is against "poet's study"
of topics like Mayan culture or a la Alice Fulton and fractals, or
even Brenda Hillman and neo-gnosticism.

I also think that looking at new metaphors in physics (for example) to
apply in poetry, for example, functions differently now than
previously, now we realize more completely that these metaphors are
often distractions, that they might get us knowledge, but the
metaphors also enforce themselves, shape that knowledge in a way.  In
other words, I'm with Mairead.  Major adjustments in world view, like
feminism, probably a lot more expansive.

A footnote to Paul:

Looking through the index of a secondary bibliography of Creeley, Dorn, =
and
Duncan (G.K. Hall, 1989) I find the following:

Steven Carter wrote a diss. finished in 1985 titled "Epistemological =
Models
Shared by American Projectivist Poetry and Quantum Physics" at Univ. of
Arizona. (This presumably is both Olson and Duncan, Duncan with about 20
pages.)

In an interview by George Bowering and Robert Hogg with Duncan in =
_Robert
Duncan: An Interview_ (Toronto: Coach House/Beaver Kosmos, 1971), Duncan
discusses his sense of particle physics.

In a Romanian essay ("Pietre in cimpul lui Robert Duncan" in _Steaua_ =
25.3,
1974) Loring Taylor discusses note the use of the field as a symbol in =
_The
Opening of the Field_, noting its relationship to relativistic physics,
field composition, linguistic fields, fields of self and poetry,
experimental fields, and the field of memory, especially childhood =
memory.
It sounds provocative, but the article is very brief.

Ruth,

McClure's introduction to his book Three Poems is the best statement =
about
PV since the actual essay, now 60 years old. (Copies available here:
http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=3DMcClure&sts=3Dt&tn=3DT=
hree+Poem
s&x=3D38&y=3D14)

Jeffrey Side was kind enough to publish my essay on McClure on the =
Argotist
website: http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Nelson%20essay.htm=20

I am working on something for the Brussels conference as well.

But Olson used Alfred North Whitehead's work as a prime source. Robin
Blaser's essay "The Violets" and Shahar Bram's book, written in Hebrew =
and
translated into English, is an excellent source: "Charles Olson and =
Alfred
North Whitehead: An Essay on Poetry."


William Carlos Williams hinted at how Field Theory should be applied to
poetry in 1948 ("The Poem as a Field of Action") and, of course, there's
Duncan's "The Opening of the Field."=20

WCW was searching for a new measure throughout his life. I think "The
Variable Foot" was a kind of awkward attempt to state the notion that, =
after
Einstein's Theory of Relativity, a more relative (open) approach to
structuring the poetic line was necessary. Olson sub-titled Projective =
Verse
"Composition by Field" and while that applies to the page itself, the =
field
of composition being much like the canvas of a Pollock painting, it also
relates to the fields of energy one enacts as they write projectively. =
Olson
said the process leads to "dimensions larger than the man."=20

I think one aspect of quantum physics which is most interesting to
contemplate as we see that line, is the notion of "non-locality." What =
is
MIND? Is it brain, or does it extend, in prayer for example, from =
Seattle
(my location) to Haiti, or to Reading, Brussels, New Zealand, Cuba, =
Mars? If
mind is non-local, then we ARE connected as one organism, making war =
akin to
shooting at yr foot.=20

McClure was influenced greatly by the Hua Yen school of Buddhism, which
predates Whitehead by quite a bit, but is quite similar. (Some scholars
trace Whitehead's ideas back to ancient China.) With Olson, inspired by
Whitehead, reality is deeper than objects. It is an "occasion of
experience." Train yourself to fully immerse your consciousness in that
occasion of experience and revision is unnecessary. Perhaps some =
fine-tuning
as Gary Snyder put it, but there is intelligence in the language of the
moment that supersedes the individual ego.

Francis Cook's "The Jewel Net of Indra" helps get these points across.

Gerald,

I second Paul's thought: good question. And Steve makes a good point, too.
While I'm not a defeatist, the horizon indeed seems very limited. Since the
historical moment of Black Mountain can't be recreated, I suspect that
anything akin to the school itself will never happen again.

That said, the principles are still alive, however. Paul makes a number of
very good points, although I'm a bit wary of Bram's study, if only because
it relies a bit too much on Whitehead to read Olson.

If you haven't done so already, I suggest you take a look at the ten volume
set of_Olson: The Journal of the Charles Olson Archives_, especially volume
two, which includes Olson's notes on the college (e.g., "A Draft of a Plan
for the College," "Black Mountain Courses of Instruction, 1954," and so
forth.) A great resource. Here is the opening paragraph from Olson's "The
Act of Writing in the Context of Postmodern Man," a course description that
appeared in the college bulletin in 1952:

"The effort is definitely non-literary. Neither is the reading in
'literature', like they say, nor is the writing 'composition'. The amount of
either is not at all the question. The idea is to enable the person to
achieve the beginnings of a disposition toward reality now, by which he or
she can bring himself or herself to bear as value."

Interesting, no? I've modeled my upper-level creative writing courses on
this description, in fact, so spaces of Black Mt. can indeed be opened up
within the larger landscape of "neo this/that," as Steve rightly says.

As for Olson's interest in the sciences, Ruth, a fantastic primer is Ann
Charters' dated but still informative book_Olson / Melville: A Study in
Affinity_, which includes the postscript "Charles Olson at Black Mountain
College 1953-56." I tend to call this postscript the "Whitehead lecture,"
since Olson discusses Whitehead at length.

Some of the important books for Olson while at Black Mt. include not only
Norbert Wiener's_Cybernetics: or Control and Communication in the Animal and
Machine_, but also Hermann Weyl's_Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural
Science_. While Whitehead is often rightly cited as the source of Olson's
knowledge of physics, he was actively reading Weyl while at Black Mt. He
also took a course on mathematics at the school, the details about which
escape me at the moment.

Obviously, though, Riemann and the non-Euclidean geometers influenced
Olson's thought, as well as Heisenberg.

Anyway, I could keep going, but this is getting long. I hope some of the
info here is useful.

Bests,
Chris

they hired artists, primarily, to teach, didn't they?

and they stressed interdisciplinarity/multidisciplinarity, didn't they?

ya, what a concept.

i looked into doing a doctorate recently but i don't have an m.a. so they
turned me away, and this was a program affiliated with digital writing,
about which i am rumoured to know something.

has less to do with art than professional certification, apparently.

i think we're supposed to do it on our own, starve, die, and hand it over to
a u.

I'm with Mairead.  It's also terribly white/Anglocentric. I suppose it
depends who the "we" are in that phrase "our possibilities".

the HEAD, by way of the EAR, to the SYLLABLE and especially
the HEART, by way of the BREATH, to the LINE

is actually my favourite quote of Oslon's, and I guess you get
something like that with Saul Williams et al.

Thanks, Cassandra, Maria and everyone for your comments on women in
academia, and at CUNY in particular.  Your comments are sadly accurate.  I
can report here of my personal experience with that institution.

I was hired approximately 19 years ago by CUNY (at the original branch, the
City College of New York), to teach feminist theory and women's contemporary
literature -- like Maria, I had a Stanford Ph.D.  I was hired by a then
fairly forward-looking dean.  But, although I was one of two professors in
my department in 10 years during the late '80's and 1990s to have a book
coming out during the tenure process (SUNY Press), and although men in my
department had been and would be tenured without any book publications and
only a smattering of articles, I would be denied tenure by CIty College, and
forced to fight through a byzantine system of appeals over months and months
-- to keep my job.  The men running my department and division at that time,
in short, tried to fire me.  They didn't like what I wrote or what I stood
for.  They also didn't like the fact that I complained about their gender
harassment, which occurred regularly enough to wear me down.  So, yes, I
spoke up; I asked them not to do it any more.

Having won tenure, at long last, through a lengthy Affirmative Action
investigation, wouldn't you think that the people involved would be
dismissed? It is true that some of the "perpetrators" "disappeared" (through
various interventions, including special retirement packages)  from my
immediate radar screen.  But then other men replaced these guys and
continued some of the same harrassments I had already experience. I fought
the same battles over and over again for Associate level, then for Full
Professor -- in spite of having as many or more publications than most of my
"generation" of faculty in the department.  I should remark that
occasionally there were men at my university who supported my case,
especially through my union; and occasionally some women who worked closely
with the CCNY administration fought to keep me from progressing at my job.
Still, it was a gender-discrimination fight -- as perceived by a federal
judge.  And, two years ago, I won a Civil Rights lawsuit -- that is, a
modest settlement that equaled lost wages for two years of non-promotion
when clearly I was qualified by CUNY standards for that position.

Why did I force the issue and fight for my own job promotion?  I know some
people would rather not.  I could have remained a perennial (and well
published) Assistant prof.  But, for me, it was the right thing to do -- to
fight.   To NOT do it was to kow-tow to illegal discrimination.

Yet it wasn't that simple. We have a Distinguished Professor of
feminist-scholar fame, Professor Jane Marcus, in my department.  The same
power structure that attempted to fire and then not promote me attempted to
demote her from a DP three years ago, after she provided sworn testimony for
my Civil Rights case.  A letter campaign to our CUNY chancellor helped turn
that case around; Professor Marcus remains a D.P.  Again, we fought -- hard,
both alone and together.  Certainly, my own reputation has been sullied at
my university.  I am often cut off when speaking in turn in open meetings
(by male chairmen).  I am given little ability to make policy in my
department.  But I have the hard-won luxury of job protection now; and I use
that to teach my courses with passion.

If you are still reading this story:  it is not a cautionary tale.  It is a
story of the reality of academe, and certainly the CUNY I know and have
experienced.   I do not regret a single minute of fighting for my rights --
or those of several other colleagues as Civil Rights problems at my college
unabashedly continue.  Because my rights and their individual rights are all
of our rights, whether you work for CUNY, or even a university, it has been
worth my frustration and pain -- and a time-consuming process.  The Civil
Rights laws in America make the plaintiff out to be a victim.  And we are
forced to fight -- a mostly individualized battle.   Yet, in truth, the
Ivory Tower is neither ivory nor lofty.  It is full of people who -- like
all industries -- often use power for petty and self-promoting purposes.
It's the same struggle everywhere.  Did I lose writing time due to this
struggle?  Of course.  But my writing, too, is motivated and has been
transformed by this struggle.  It grew (and I grew, in spite of myself)
through this hard work.

But I doubt I'll ever put in an application for Distinguished Professor at
CUNY.

more than feminism

beyond bland humanism

maybe a sort of eco/survivalism,
something that unites man & beast

I would venture that the temper of the time is against "poet's study"
of topics like Mayan culture or a la Alice Fulton and fractals, or
even Brenda Hillman and neo-gnosticism.

I also think that looking at new metaphors in physics (for example) to
apply in poetry, for example, functions differently now than
previously, now we realize more completely that these metaphors are
often distractions, that they might get us knowledge, but the
metaphors also enforce themselves, shape that knowledge in a way.  In
other words, I'm with Mairead.  Major adjustments in world view, like
feminism, probably a lot more expansive.

Beyond metaphors, Catherine, is experience. An experience of process at the level of Whitehead's prehension. A world view that goes beyond gender differences, broader (no pun intended) to a world-centric view. This is what interests me. I still think a study of Mayan culture would be useful, especially given the significance they attached to 2012 and the perspective they brought to their study. Beyond a world view, theirs was more of how to relate to the galaxy. Have we exhausted the possibilities of this? Probably not.

The quest for a sacred feminine, sure. I am for a restoration and recognition of that and practice it in my own way. Perhaps deepening our perception and capacity for compassion (still seen as a feminine trait) is the task. I think Olson's process points us in this direction, toward a poetics as cosmology. Certainly this was Robin Blaser's view in his essay The Violets.

This is just incredible -- I'm very glad you fought and won!  And yet, I'm sure, as you note, that many just give up, "learn their lessons" and save their energies.  I'm so sorry to read these details, and yet, the details need to be better known; otherwise people reduce feminist thought to something abstractly "just for women" - as though changing the entire structure isn't good for everyone.  Thanks for posting your story, Laura.



MS: IT COMES DOWN TO ASKING PEOPLE TO RECONSTRUCT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF GENDER ROLES AND THEIR WHOLE SYSTEM OF VALUES.
GS: Right. In a way, what happens to men is called "politics" and what happens to women is called "culture". We've taken one giant step forward by convincing the majority of the country that women can do what men can do. But the next step is convincing the country that men can do what women can do. So far, we don't believe it ourselves.

MS: HOW CAN A MAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT? YOU SAID EARLIER THAT MEN CAN BE FEMINISTS - IS THERE A MISCONCEPTION THAT TO BE A PART OF THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT YOU HAVE TO BE A WOMAN?
GS: If you think about the racial parallel it gets more clear. I'm white and you're white but we can work for racial equality. We become very good workers for racial equality only once we realize that we're also being ghettoized. We're being culturally deprived. We're stuck in a white ghetto. Once men realize that they are also deprived - not as much as women, just as whites are not as deprived as blacks - but there is a full circle of human qualities we all have a right to. And they're confined to the "masculine" ones, which are seventy percent of all of them, and we're confined to the "feminine" ones, which are thirty percent. We're missing more, but they're still missing a lot. If a man fights to be his whole self, to be creative, to express emotions men are not supposed to express, do jobs men are not supposed to do, take care of his own children - all of these things are part of the feminist movement.

Professor -- in spite of having as many or more publications than most of my
"generation" of faculty in the department.  I should remark that
occasionally there were men at my university who supported my case,
especially through my union; and occasionally some women who worked closely
with the CCNY administration fought to keep me from progressing at my job.
Still, it was a gender-discrimination fight -- as perceived by a federal
judge.  And, two years ago, I won a Civil Rights lawsuit -- that is, a
modest settlement that equaled lost wages for two years of non-promotion
when clearly I was qualified by CUNY standards for that position.

Why did I force the issue and fight for my own job promotion?  I know some
people would rather not.  I could have remained a perennial (and well
published) Assistant prof.  But, for me, it was the right thing to do -- to
fight.   To NOT do it was to kow-tow to illegal discrimination.

Yet it wasn't that simple. We have a Distinguished Professor of
feminist-scholar fame, Professor Jane Marcus, in my department.  The same
power structure that attempted to fire and then not promote me attempted to
demote her from a DP three years ago, after she provided sworn testimony for
my Civil Rights case.  A letter campaign to our CUNY chancellor helped turn
that case around; Professor Marcus remains a D.P.  Again, we fought -- hard,
both alone and together.  Certainly, my own reputation has been sullied at
my university.  I am often cut off when speaking in turn in open meetings
(by male chairmen).  I am given little ability to make policy in my
department.  But I have the hard-won luxury of job protection now; and I use
that to teach my courses with passion.

If you are still reading this story:  it is not a cautionary tale.  It is a
story of the reality of academe, and certainly the CUNY I know and have
experienced.   I do not regret a single minute of fighting for my rights --
or those of several other colleagues as Civil Rights problems at my college
unabashedly continue.  Because my rights and their individual rights are all
of our rights, whether you work for CUNY, or even a university, it has been
worth my frustration and pain -- and a time-consuming process.  The Civil
Rights laws in America make the plaintiff out to be a victim.  And we are
forced to fight -- a mostly individualized battle.   Yet, in truth, the
Ivory Tower is neither ivory nor lofty.  It is full of people who -- like
all industries -- often use power for petty and self-promoting purposes.
It's the same struggle everywhere.  Did I lose writing time due to this
struggle?  Of course.  But my writing, too, is motivated and has been
transformed by this struggle.  It grew (and I grew, in spite of myself)
through this hard work.

But I doubt I'll ever put in an application for Distinguished Professor at
CUNY.

I was sorry to hear that David Franks has died. Here's a poem by David
published in Angel Hair Magazine #6, edited by Anne Waldman and Lewis
Warsh, 1969.


THE FOUNTAIN

I walked two times around the fountain
and I watched the branches full of green leaves
double in the still water the light around

and I sat down on the green bench in the middle
and my eyes fixed on the only lite window in the
tenement across the street from where I sat and it
was awhile until I focused my sight and I saw cut
through the blinds a man wearing a white undershirt
washing in a sink I couldn't see and then I thought
no there are lovers there, not a man washing, and
I saw that for awhile and I saw them draw the blinds,
but I don't think they actually did and then it
was the man wearing a white undershirt again shaving
for awhile over the sink I couldn't see the "Hot"
faucet was turned on all the way and he forced it and
then I saw the man glancing at me;

and I wondered if he saw me; I unfocused my eyes
again and thought and turned away and heard sirens
and I began to feel cold and I remembered that
it was after 2 o'clock Wednesday morning and
I wondered if that was too late to be where I was;

then I looked up at the window and the man
wearing the white undershirt and the lovers who
drew the blinds were watching me and then they weren't
and they were -- and then they weren't and then they were --
and they they weren't and then -- finally i said, leaning
forward pointing emphatically in the direction of the
mailbox across the street on the corner:

								"Fuck it! If the police
come -- I'll be pissed off!"
							
						    But I felt gentle

and then I got afraid and I walked two times
around the fountain and I watched the branches
full of green leaves double in the still water
the light around -- and I walked away from that place

to tell you about it
but you weren't there
and then you came
and you were.

Laura Hinton,

THANKS for posting this to the Poetics Listserv.

As I told you in my personal email to you after I read it, before I was
done reading it, I was crying like a freedom fighter.  I have written to  this
list in the past that my own "fight" for promotion wasn't even one.  I  was
outside the bureaucracy and up against "life" as the discouraging  force.
I was a fellowship-winner twice in creative writing at prestigious
programs, published nationally early, but managed to find adjunct composition
positions afterward that paid only $3,000 a year.  I filed b'cy related to  two
years' lost earnings and went on medical welfare; moved away from my new
family of writers and poets in Houston -- left the state -- to live at my
mother's house in MN.  That amazing woman, Florence, let me live there,  write
(and think).  In a culture where people are trained, she was not  supposed to
be "the safety net"; we are supposed to be that.  Our trainings  must not
be regarded as useless, as not leading to sufficient incomes.  Our  keen
knowledge -- our vast reading and our writing practices -- must be  transmitted
to one another and to next generations.

As you transmit it in teaching with passion.

Ann Bogle

Laura, thank you for posting this in public -- I think many women (both who
win and lose) in these battles, are afraid of putting the discrimination
cases out there. There was a noted case at UC Berkeley (Jenny Harrison) in
mathematics, that she finally won after 8 years.

Well put, Catherine.

----- Original Message ----
From: Catherine Daly

I would venture that the temper of the time is against "poet's study"
of topics like Mayan culture or a la Alice Fulton and fractals, or
even Brenda Hillman and neo-gnosticism.

I also think that looking at new metaphors in physics (for example) to
apply in poetry, for example, functions differently now than
previously, now we realize more completely that these metaphors are
often distractions, that they might get us knowledge, but the
metaphors also enforce themselves, shape that knowledge in a way.  In
other words, I'm with Mairead.  Major adjustments in world view, like
feminism, probably a lot more expansive.

All best,

mathematicians & my father also a physicist--they wd have enjoyed this

Comments about Depleted Burden Down and the poetry of Deborah Meadows:

"Deborah Meadows=92 Depleted Burden Down begins its work in the space =
where your critical-poetic home used to be. In the midst of the rubble, =
which is also and nevertheless an ambiguously inflected =93clearing=94 =
(with its estranged =93beautiful=94 scraps of once-familiar meaning), =
Meadows asks who-in-relation writes or speaks of where we have gotten =
to, and in what language of. =93This folding knife, this toad-stabber =
and father-killer was distributed to all veterans of World War II in =
bivouacs and colleges=85forced to thought.=94 At the head in our hearts, =
the question whither the secular democratic critical project, our texts =
that aspire from its raging fires and somber halls. To start: lift off, =
burden down, scavenge parts for new lodgings in this gritty, smart =
book."  =96 Laura Elrick=20

"If it were possible to speak of speech as a shimmering =93landscape=94 =
(an endless shifting of refraction angles, =93Indra=92s veil=94), =
slipping away from the perspective of =93seeing/knowing,=94 then the =
poetry of Deborah Meadows seems to me a thorough and perilous =
investigation of a border region between experience and description=97=93<=
=85> How we can see // a creature and not know // what it is <=85>=94 =
=97that is, at the floating point that is always =93beside the point,=94 =
has no =93space=94 and yet is an all-convex system of knowledge in =
ignorance (=93but if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time =
when the change occurs there will be no knowledge=85=94 =97 Cratylus). =
The poem =93After H=F6lderlin=94 (from her collection, Goodbye Tissues) =
says this directly as though vision yet again stumbled on a bothersome =
footnote to a welltrodden route. That which poetry can be, to Deborah =
Meadows, takes place precisely in this aporia. And not so much =93takes =
place=94 as takes place in transition. There are no dharmas: they are =
mere reflections of one another."  =96 Arkadii Dragomoshchenko (tr. E. =
Pavloff)

 My father is a theoretical physicist and worked and taught also in
bio-chemistry and bio-physics,  back in the mid 1970's he was teaching
multi-media courses which made use of overhead projection, taped readings b=
y
a variety of persons of the writings of poets, philosophers, scientists,
Marxists, Situationists, Derrida, etc and also videos, slides, contemporary
music among which Free jazz played large part--he was investigating the
interrelationships of all branches of culture and knowledge in ways not
unlike that of Olson and his range of students, followers, those influenced=
,
inspired by him=97


My brother Dr Paul Harris (Loyola Marymount University in LA) has taken up
the torch for some time and is a President of the Society for Time, an
organizer of yearly events which encompass music, writing, Oulipo--he has
written a lot on this and uses Oulipo as a teaching device--and is a good
friend of among others involved with the Time Society, (international
Society for the Study of Tim=97forgive me, I often confuse the actual
name--)-Michel Serres whose books I would highly recommend as they are vast
studies in their  interrelationships of the arts and sciences is a good
friend of his, are others in this field around the world.

 To indulge myself in some brotherly respect=97and =93nepotism??--!!=97chec=
k out
Paul Harris=92 site---found by searching Paul Andre Harris--)



  Perhaps it is the narrowness=97the narrowing down of focus--in since the
times of Olson et alia--a turning away from broader so to speak as Paul
Nelson phrased it, concerns, and more inward inrelationwith language, so
that language has for sometime n may quarters eschewed the kinds of
interrelationships with the world and word in favor of the word itself, and
as a consequence has taken a turn ever more towards a Formalism not so far
distant from the New Formalism might be supposed.



(On the other hand, one might examine this narrowing down in terms of
Isidore Isou's Lettriste theories of the development of Poetry especially,
in terms of periods of =93Amplitude=94 followed by those of =93Chiseling=94=
--)



=93It is not the elements themselves which are new, but the order of their
arrangement,=94 writes  Pascal (an influence on Robert Smithson=97fitting f=
or an
artist ,theoretician, critic, reviewer, essayist concerned with
Earthworks--) and so re =93the temper of our times,=94 one may be =93absolu=
tely
modern=94 as Rimbaud wrote=97and still  make use of any forms, no matter ho=
w
=93Old=94 =93out of date, of fashion, hors de mode au lieu de hors=97ou deh=
ors-- de
monde=94--) of study outside "poetics" which, both being in the world, exis=
t
simultaneously, may be studied together in order to enlarge the spheres of
awareness in relation with language.  One might say that Olson himself is
not so much "new" even in his own time, as he himself well knew and pointed
out--but is/was  an extension further of developments going on in Modernism
let alone with American writing itself since the times of Poe, Emerson ,
Whitman, Thoreau, Dickinson Melville et alia, in which  the large world is
taken to be a direct participant with language in the investigation of the
world as it exits and as existed through time, whether in terms of ecology,
or of cosmologies, or, as Melville shows, in the history itself the Whaling
Industry which involves world wide voyaging and trade not only of goods but
also of information ,a data about the physical world in terms of navigation
flora, fauna (the Voyage of the Beagle for example--and, in
fiction/literature and later, science fiction-itself an influence and tool
used by Smithson--- mixing fact and fiction--of the travel Literatures of
the period 1680-1800)--the influence of Von Humboldt on painting as depicte=

in the novella by Cesar Aira An Episode in the Life of a Landscape
Painter  (preface
by Roberto Bolano) re a landscape painter from Germany roving, painting and

Olson called himself an =93Archeologist of Morning=94=97an Archeologist of =

poetry, culture, the world =93itself=94=97so that, as with Smithson=97=93th=
e present .
. . must go into the places where remote futures meet remote pasts=94=97



One might think of Smithson himself=97and Poe, whose Pym Smithson writes of
(in A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects=94)-as =93seem(ing) to me
excellent art criticism and prototype for rigorous =93non site=94
investigations.=94  Smithson and Poe may both be thought of=97I=92ve writte=
n on
this elsewhere=97as Archeologists of Mourning=97and of the =93Work of Mourn=

Freud calls it.  Indeed, one may read Poe=92s =93Morning on the Wissihican=
=94 in
terms both of Olson=92s =93Archeologist of Morning=94 and Freud=92s Work, g=
iving one
the =93Mourning on the Wissihican=94=97And note that Smithson=92s comments =
on Poe=92s
Pym end with the final lines of that narrative and its =93epilogue=94=97=93=
=94I have
graven it within the hills and my vengeance upon the dust wit in the rock=
=94=97



(For a long time=97 at my blog for example, I call myself and my work =96an
Anarkeyologist, doing the work of Anarkeyology--)


Olson saw himself indeed as part of a tradition extending back in time to
Herodotus, in terms of "istorin, to find out for oneself"--and developed hi=
s
ideas in terms of tectonic shifts changes in climate and types of animals
and flora found through the world as well as specifically within
Gloucester--his studies, like Robert Smithson=92s Earthworks projects
involving Sites and non-Sites mapping a correlation between the micro and
macro cosmism not only on the surface of the earth, but deep below it--and
also under the oceans--and into space (the figure of the aircraft carriers
at the conclusion of Call me Ishmael, which unbeknownst to Olson at the
time, had been completed the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima--thus
ushering in the Space and Atomic Ages, the Cold War=97and, according to som=
e
definitions, claims, among many-- that postmodern of which Olson was alread=
y
writing in 1950--

The Brakage Issue of Film Culture (Fall 1963) concludes with B's letters to
Jane re his visit with Olson and their discussions about focal points and a=
l
the various meanings of the rod "vision."

This was entering into roughly the same years in which Jerome Rothenberg wa=
s
putting forth in his colossally influential (and to this day)  book
Technicians of the Scared, which opened up new "open fields' not only in
terms of ethno poetics, but for myself, something my father had long taught
me of using the Alhambra as an actual site example--the interconnection
among the technologies of writing, as both of and as of mathematics, and
poetry, language--and i turn, the interrelationship is of these with the
philosophers of the time in which the Alhambra was built, a time perhaps
unique in human history n the West, win which the Moslem Christian and
Jewish cultures were all working together on a similar and often overlappin=
g
as well as directly connected project--a time in which the spiritual and
philosophical teachings of these cultures were--working together--a part of
each other rather than apart from each other=97

 (See Jerome Rothenberg's superb Anthologies-in-Progress blog:

poemsandpoetics.*blogspot*.com <http://poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com>

 Re the work of Jerry Rothenberg, I think that his Anthologies themselves
have revolutionized not only the contexts, histories, cultures, technologie=
s
of poetry and poetics-in terms of the Western tradition=97(I=92m not qualif=
ied
to venture writing of this in re the eastern traditions--) not only of the
texts which one is given to work with being immensely expanded, but also in
terms of reconceiving the Anthology itself=97which, considering the vast
stretches of time and space, of ranges of poetries and poetics, Rothenberg
has  brought into a continually emerging and enlarging frame=97(both Olson=
=97as
Creeley so brilliantly pointed out re O=92s =93we are inside limits=94 bein=
g also
the opening out of immense possibilities--  and Smithson agree on the need
for, as Smithson puts it, a container, for the ocean Experience of art,
poetry and the making of it require that =93for there to be art, it must ha=
ve
a container=94=97as=97not only a =93container=94 with immense possibilities=
=97but
Rothenberg, for me at any rate, has created of the Anthology itself, and in
turn, of his series with his collaborators, of a LONG POEM=97a LONG POEM
encompassing all these texts from all their various epochs and
understandings, their own contexts and those supplied by later times and
critiques, understandings=97and also in terms of a continually expanding
awareness of poetry as a form of investigation and exploration indeed into
Smithson=92s =93remote future meets remote pasts=94=97which allow for the s=
orts of
=93ruins in reverse=94 and =93reverse engineering=94 of which Smithson, and=

hidden, like Poe=92s Purloined Letter=97in plain sight, to which I add also
=93site=94 and =93cite=94=97



I think of Jerry=92s project as being at once present, a LONG POEM, a libra=

an anthology of =93containers=94 each pointing to myriads of never ending

(When Robin Blaser was here in Milwaukee  few years go he spoke a bit about
the Alhambra n during the break sitting out front of Woodland  Pattern Book
Center, having our smokes, we discussed this much further, and told him of
what my father had shown me at the Alhambra--)

Juts because the "temper of the times" may seem to work against the
openings, possibilities and uses of such approaches with poetry and
poetics--does not mean one need to conform--which, unfortunately has been
greatly the "scene' for some time, an unquestioning following of various
dogmas and in turn a consequent contraction and constriction of what are
considered the "concerns" of poetry and poetics. All too often ,one finds
various approaches, questions, issues, examples, dismissed out of hand
simply because they do not "fit in" with a conformity with the 'temper of
the times" in re what language is concerned with what ways on may
investigate its lives and effects, its histories, its uses, its ways of
working as poetical language rather than continually coming across a
separation like so many Walls between the "poetic" and anything hauling wit=
h
it the dross of the world, be it politics, history, other cultures
languages, etc--

Dear Friends and Colleagues;

Here are the first thirty pages of "The Gateless Gate-New Series":
http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate-R/Cover-R.htm

These thirty pages--which begin past the introduction--consist of 15 =
pages of text and 15 facing pages of images that don't resemble, but =
rather echo each other on various levels of consciousness.=20
Those of you who read the original texts, which I withdrew from the =
internet this morning, will recognize them, although there's been some =
rewriting, repositioning, deletions and additions. The images, however, =
are all new, their code still wet.

Thank you for your participation in this project that opens one way of =
writing, designing and presenting literature made on and for the =
Internet, one that seeks a continuum to the tradition of books and other =
printed media, while using the tools and avenues of the newer medium.

If you want your name removed for this mailing list, please let me know.
Your feedback and critique is always welcome and taken seriously. =20

-Joel Weishaus

Class and Race Fear
The Rescue Operation's Priorities in Haiti
By NELSON P. VALDÃ‰S

   "The contempt we have been taught to entertain for blacks, make us fear many
things that are founded neither in reason nor experience."

   - Alexander Hamilton in letter to John Hay, 1799.

   "Only those who hate the black population, see hatred in blacks"

   - JosÃ© MartÃ­, Montecristi Manifesto, 1895

The recent earthquakes that have demolished the city of Port au Prince and its
surroundings has left Haiti stateless, ever poorer, desperate and in need of
long term global assistance. A world-wide rescue operation has been initiated.
But, it is questionable to what extent the best interests of the people of
Haiti have been and will be considered, in the long run.

First, the foreign aid teams "rescued" and took out of the country the
non-Haitians, particularly the Europeans, Americans and assorted other
tourists. The Voice of America on Jan. 16 reported: "In the last day or so the
United States and French governments have started running passenger flights out
of the country [Haiti] for evacuees from those countries.  People line up and
wait for a plane to arrive so they can leave Haiti and leave behind what is a
very difficult, traumatic experience for many." [1]

Second, five days have gone by without any real significant distribution of
medical supplies, food or water to the neediest people.

The facts indicate clear priorities: the Haitians are not first in line. In
fact, the rescuers seem to have a widespread fear of the poor and desperate
Haitians. A Scottish reporter said, "aid workers in Haiti today called for more
security amid fears of attacks by increasingly desperate earthquake survivors."
[2]

Yet, the Haitians have been extraordinarily patient despite the fact that their
world has collapsed around them.

The assistance teams seem reluctant to distribute until they feel secure. Thus,
the US government sent troops to bring aid and the Haitian government
dispatched police to provide "security," and respond to the exaggerated rumors
of "looting." Indeed, there have been reports that the security squads moved
the aid providers to "secure" places. [3]

The Haitian people who wait for basic needs have not been mobilized to work on
their own behalf. Rather, the "humanitarians" treat them as children, with no
thought to providing them with the tools to help themselves. One Haitian consul
to Brazil, George Samuel Antoine declared two days ago that any country that
happens to have Africans is cursed! [4] Shades of Pat Robertson  and David
Brooks.

Seemingly, the outsiders coming to help the people don't trust the natives,
despite the fact that the Haitians are dying, hungry, thirsty, sick, homeless,
and with most of their families gone or lost. The Haitian chief of police, like
most people in positions of authority, is a foreigner appointed by the United
Nations.

Meanwhile, the twice elected and twice removed political leader of the Haitians
- Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not permitted to enter his own country. In fact,
President Obama appointed one of those who ousted him  - George W. Bush - to
help  "supervise" the "reconstruction" of Haiti. Bush merited his appointment
presumably because of the wonderful job he did supervising the post Katrina aid
program. Meanwhile, for all intent and purposes there is no longer, except
symbolically, a Haitian government.

Perhaps it is too harsh but it appears as if  those in charge think that a few
thousand more Haitians dead would make it easier to control the situation.  USA
Today has reported, "Rescuers pulled a dehydrated but otherwise uninjured woman
from the ruins of a luxury hotel in the Haitian capital early Sunday, drawing
applause from onlookers who have seen little to cheer as the body count
continued to rise from Tuesday's earthquake."

They expect Haitians to remain patient, without food or water or aid to rescue
their friends and relatives. Haitians are not even informed as to what to
expect or when.

Some US tv channels have begun broadcasting about vodou burials. The US mass
media has turned the whole tragedy into another narcissistic story about how
Americans handle disasters. Thus, Hillary at one end, and Bill on the other
travel going to Haiti to see for themselves! [5] As if such voyages have
inherently curative powers!

Ironically, US and NATO can quickly deliver death from the air, but, apparently
won't unleash their technology and resources to quickly save lives. United
Nations tanks have been sent to different locations throughout what remains of
the city, particularly the poorer neighborhoods such as CitÃ© Soleil. [6] A poor
substitute for food and water.

In Afghanistan drones fire at will with no one at the Pentagon expressing
minimal concern, yet, in the Haitian case dropping food and water has been
avoided "for fear of riots." Apparently no one has figured that people will
riot because of the absence of drinking water or food; unless they have to go
without either for enough time so that the Haitians experience a Caribbean
version of the final solution.

On January 15th, the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs issued a report stating, "Haiti is currently at UN
Security Phase 3. This will implicate ongoing operations in terms of limiting
the ability to move around the city and work at night (which is also hindered
by the lack of electricity). Patrols reported that the situation is calm in
general, but there are reports of stone throwing at passing vehicles, looting
and acts of vandalism. ICRC has inspected several prisons. The central prison
was completely destroyed, meaning up to 4,000 prisoners have escaped." [7]
Under Security Phase III all international staff and families are relocated
inside or outside the country.

It is unclear who is directing what. Rear Admiral Ted Branch, the most senior
military official aboard the USS Carl Vinson stated,  "We have lift, we have
communications, we have some command and control, but we don't have much relief
supplies to offer.We have no supplies at the airport that we have access to.
There are other supplies there that are under the control of other agencies,
other organizations and we haven't yet coordinated together to make those
supplies available for anyone to deliver." [8] The United Nations and the US
authorities on the ground, are telling those who directly want to deliver help
not to do so because they might be attacked by "hungry mobs." [9] Two cargo
planes from Doctors Without Borders have been forced to land in the Dominican
Republic because the shipments have to be accompanied within Port au Prince by
US military escort, according to the US command. [10]

One American on the ground summed up the situation: "For the aid to work and
the teams of search and rescue workers to be able to do their job there is
going to need to be a major effort of all people to lay down their own fear and
personal need and allow the help to get to the worst off. Pray that people will
think of others as best they can and that relief will begin to get to the
places it is needed most." [11]  Such fears, created and nurtured in colonial
times, have been reproduced for over two hundred years.  Alexander Hamilton and
JosÃ© MartÃ­ recognized the humanity of the former black slaves  turned
revolutionaries and told us to put our fears aside.   As Linda Polman writes in
The Times of  London class and racial fear by the rescue teams is costing the
lives of thousands in Haiti. [12]

Kenning Editions proudly announces THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF POETS
THEATER: 1945-1985, edited by Kevin Killian and David Brazil.

With new interest in poetry as a performative art, and with prewar
experiments much in mind, the young poets of postwar America infused the
stage with the rhythms and shocks of their poetry. From the
multidisciplinary nexus of Black Mountain, to the Harvard-based
Cambridge Poets Theatre, to the West Coast Beats and San Francisco
Renaissance, these energies manifested themselves all at once, and
through the decades have continued to grow and mutate, innovating a form
of writing that defies boundaries of genre. THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF
POETS THEATER: 1945-1985 documents the emergence, growth, and varied
fortunes of the form over decades of American literary history, with a
focus on key regional movements. The largest and most comprehensive
anthology of its kind yet assembled, the volume collects classics of
poets theater as well as rarities long out of print and texts from
unpublished manuscripts and archives. It will be an indispensable
reference for students of postwar American poetry and avant-garde theater.

Among the poets featured in THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF POETS THEATER are
Charles Olson, John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, Russell Atkins, Gregory
Corso, Helen Adam, Michael McClure, James Broughton, Kenneth Koch,
Jackson Mac Low, Lorenzo Thomas, Anne Waldman, ruth weiss, Hannah
Weiner, Lew Welch, Sonia Sanchez, Joe Brainard, Bruce Andrews, Keith
Waldrop, Rosmarie Waldrop, Bob Holman and Bob Rosenthal, Steve Benson,
Ted Greenwald, Carla Harryman, Ntozake Shange, Bob Perelman, Kit
Robinson, Robert Grenier, Alan Bernheimer, Charles Bernstein, Stephen
Rodefer, Fiona Templeton, Kenward Elmslie, and Leslie Scalapino. Also
included are previously unpublished plays by Jack Spicer, V.R. "Bunny"
Lang, James Schuyler, Robert Duncan, Madeline Gleason, Diane di Prima,
Barbara Guest, Ron Padgett, James Keilty, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Johanna
Drucker, and Nada Gordon. The editors provide informative and
provocative prefatory matter, including extensive notes on each play, as
well as several that fall within the purview of the book but, for one
reason or another, were omitted, as with Pedro Pietri's The Masses Are
Asses or Jessica Hagedorn's Tenement Lover. Rounding out the book are
contemporary classics, such as LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka's Dutchman and
Kathy Acker's The Birth of the Poet.

This is a great book! Here are the poets, the great modern poets who
have given us our language, our imagery, our style---Judith Malina /
Don't be fooled by the sober title. This wonderful volume cannot but
delight anyone who likes their plays served in the raw and the cooked of
poetry.---Caroline Bergvall / This is a major contribution to poetics
and performance studies.---Michael Davidson

Thursday, January 21, 9:00 PM.  Luggage Store Gallery -- 1007 Market St. at 6th in San Francisco

A workshop production of "Terrible Things Will Happen But It Will Be Okay:  A Donner Party Opera."

Music by Guillermo Galindo, libretto by Hugh Behm-Steinberg.

From
the distant future, where God has merged with the Walt Disney
Corporation, a group of tourists come on a pilgrimage to witness the
last days of the Donner Party and to meet the Great Bear of California.

This will be a staged reading/singing of the libretto with an electronic musical background.

For those in the bay area, hope you can stop by and see us!

Dear Poetics friends in San Diego:

One of our great grad students is coming to San Diego to do some work with
the Reznikoff papers March 1-5 (see below).

If anybody can help with housing, or a lead on housing, please let me know
backchannel.

Thanks,
Aldon



Hi Aldon--

I will be in San Diego to look at the Reznikoff Papers from March 1-5.  I'll
be arriving at 11:19am on 3/1, so that won't be a full day of research --
I'll probably go to the Mandeville Special Collections to fill out some
paper work that day.  The full days of research will be March 2-4.  I'll be
leaving San Diego at 8:00am on March 5.

Have a great weekend,
Julius

This is the sorriest funniest most possibliest book I've ever read.  Brian,
you're holding a mirror up to life as it is lived, pinning the chaos with
whatever language can be trafficked.  Move over Conceptual Poetry, this is
Actual Poetry.  You are not alone!

WHY THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED AN ANNIE WARHOL OR A FRANCINE BACON by Germaine
Greer

In May last year, the Centre Pompidou consigned to storage nearly all its
works by male artists and rehung its permanent collection to show only work=
s
by women. Camille Morineau, the curator of elles@centrepompidou, said the
show was "going to be dramatic in a big way". It wasn't. The art press
simply ignored it. The Guardian was one of few newspapers to ask itself the
question: "Is the art world finally taking work created by women seriously?=
"

British galleries are less, not more, interested in women's work than Frenc=
h
ones. The National Gallery owns paintings by only 10 women, of whom only
four have been deemed worthy of representation in the main galleries, where
you will find one Rachel Ruysch, one Berthe Morisot, and two paintings each
by Vig=E9e-Le Brun and Catherina van Hemessen. The rest, with the exception=
 of
Rosa Bonheur, can be found in Room A, the study collection, which is open
for three and a half hours on Wednesday afternoons.

The Centre Pompidou, popularly known as Beaubourg and officially as the
Mus=E9e National d'Art Moderne, houses works dating from 1905. -Morineau wa=
s
quoted as saying that until now there were not enough works by women in the
collection to have been able to mount anything on the scale of
elles@centrepompidou. After five years of a deliberate policy of spending
40% of the acquisitions budget on them, works by women now account for 17%
of the permanent collection. This -compares with the 13% of female artists
in the Tate collections.

The exhibition takes up the fourth floor of the vast building, plus odd
rooms on the fifth. The entrance is signalled by a purple panel, on which
have been mounted large buttons of different colours; 11 bear the feminised
name of a well-known male artist, Annie Warhol, Francine Bacon etc. The 12t=
h
bears the name Louis Bourgeois. Though this jeu d'esprit, by Agn=E8s
Thurnauer, has its admirers, it is after all feeble. Does anyone really
think that Martin Kippenberger could have been Martine Kippenberger?

The storm of words that accompanies the exhibition stresses that its
intention is to restore women to their rightful place in art history, as if
there was a vast mass of wonderful work by women artists just waiting to be
brought to light. The exhibition has been treated as a journey of discovery
of works that have been forgotten or lost, but many, including the best of
them, are stupefyingly familiar. Some major artists have been sampled in a
fashion that seems positively flippant. Jenny Holzer's 26 Inflammatory
Essays have been reduced to eight, replicated and mounted on a partition in
uniform stripes from ceiling to floor, like cheap wallpaper.

Eva Hesse is represented by Untitled (1970), a seven-part sculpture made of
fibreglass and polyester resin over polyethylene sheeting and aluminium
wire. When it was made, the 34-year-old artist was dying. She never saw the
finished work, which differs significantly from her model. The book
published to accompany the exhibition claims that the piece was bought by
the Centre Pompidou in 1986, other sources that it was presented to the
museum by Mr and Mrs W Ganz. Time and poor conservation have reduced it to =
a
sticky mess.

Some of the younger women artists in the show may turn out to be
-discoveries, but too many of them are making the kinds of female body art
that have been doing the rounds for years. Innocents may be excited by
Sigalit Landau's Barbed Hula of 2001, a video showing her full-frontal nake=
d
doing the hula with a hoop made of barbed wire, but only if they were too
young to see Marina Abramowic=B4 slicing into her naked belly in the 1970s,=
 or
Orlan on the operating table in the 1990s. Later this year, Abramowic=B4 wi=
ll
be performing throughout her planned retrospective at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York. The life's work of Nancy Spero, poorly represented in this
exhibition, will be celebrated at the Centre Pompidou. Both shows will be
more rewarding experiences than elles@centrepompidou.
The effect of offering a sampler of the work of 200 women is to diminish th=
e
achievement of all of them. By lumping the major with the minor, and by
showing only minor works of major figures, elles@centrepompidou managed to
convince too many visitors to the exhibition that there was such a thing as
women's art and that women artists were going nowhere. Wrong, on both
counts._Guardian

Good use of your web-poet expertise,  Brian!  Who says poetry isn't
practical, and can't make a political difference? (Auden?)

I've wanted to leave Bank of America for years. They definitely do tricky
maneuvers that manipulate funds and screw their customers.  The banking
monopolies -- my own smaller and more decent bank was long ago swallowed by
Bank of America -- are to blame. We have no place to go, as Amy points out.
(I had until recently considered HSBC, which is in my neighborhood.)

Good luck with this book!
Laura

& dark matter.
forgot that.

not enough actual mass in universe, but the damn thing still expands ... since physics isn't really advancing in any but a few way-out-there conceptual ways, poets might as well get in on the act.

One of my favorite Einstein Quotes: There's only 2 things that are infinite. The Universe and human stupidy. And I'm not so sure about the universe.

& it seems Uncle Al made an incorrect call concerning the universe.

I'm wondering about those physics metaphors & its possible femine component.
Where's the singularity? The self...
The inflationary universe? Society

A BLACK HOLE ... Sleep ... -- marish sleep?

Physics/metanarratives ... on & on ...
survivalism, identity, the baffling single minded pronoun: "I."

& I recently picked up a feminisst book that may oust Kant/foundational metaphysics -- 'tho that's 2 centuries old.

: book: The Madwoman's Reason:
blurb:

"Nancy Holland draws on the work of Heidegger and Derrida to formulate a concept of appropriate action that can address bothe extraorinary ethical problems with particular cultural tradition and moral conflict between different cultures. Her feminist reappropriation of the concept of the appropriate is then further developed by reference to Aristotle and Kant,whose ethical theories, she argues, are independent of their metaphysics ...

As an example of the application of her theory, Holland examines the problem of ordaining women in the Roman Catholic Church and then goes on to compare her approach with that of other philosophers working in virtue theory, postmodern ethics, and feminism.

Virtue theory!!!!!!!!!!!!
Vice has glamour on his side to tempt
but virtue is most lovely.

----- Original Message ----
From: Catherine Daly

I would venture that the temper of the time is against "poet's study"
of topics like Mayan culture or a la Alice Fulton and fractals, or
even Brenda Hillman and neo-gnosticism.

I also think that looking at new metaphors in physics (for example) to
apply in poetry, for example, functions differently now than
previously, now we realize more completely that these metaphors are
often distractions, that they might get us knowledge, but the
metaphors also enforce themselves, shape that knowledge in a way.  In
other words, I'm with Mairead.  Major adjustments in world view, like
feminism, probably a lot more expansive.

Mary, try this, which the Post put on its Twitter page:

http://u.nu/9ajj4

It works for me. If all else fails just go to the main Post site:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/

and put "Loden" in the search box on the upper left. The article comes right
up.

Thanks so much for wanting to read it!

the universe can be finite from the perspective of an added dimension yet
infinite in extent to the inhabitants. this is basically a consequence of
the ability to conceive of eternity in an hour and infinity in a grain of
sand.

here's a poem (in rhyming couplets) i wrote called alice in flatland that
explores it: http://vispo.com/writings/poems/alice.htm . this is one of the
first pages i put on my web site.

way back when i was writing poemy poems!

a mathematician/physicist friend of mine says "physics is over". for now,
anyway, perhaps.

From: "Nikhil Aziz, Grassroots International" <listmanager@grassrootsonline.org>

Since Haiti suffered a massive earthquake on January 12, the vastness of
the devastation has become increasingly apparent. Some news reports
estimate between 100,000 and 200,000 dead, and ten times that number
displaced.

https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5123/t/6631/shop/custom.jsp?donate_page_KEY=1694

For 20 years, Grassroots International has worked with our partners in
Haiti and will continue to support them in this challenging time. 100% of
donations to Grassroots International's Earthquake Response Fund for Haiti
will support our partners and meet the urgent and long-term rebuilding
needs of the population. Grassroots International works with four main
groups in Haiti:

     * Haitian Platform to Advocate Alternative Development (PAPDA)
     * National Congress of Papaye Peasant Movement (MPNKP)
     * Peasant Movement of Papaye (MPP)
     * Platform of Haitian Human Rights Organizations (POHDH)

Our partner Camille Chalmers of PAPDA informed us, "The situation is
dramatic. Three million homeless. An entire country crying. Over 100,000
dead. Hundreds of thousands injured and dead bodies everywhere. The entire
population is sleeping in the streets and waiting for replies to their
pleas and more blows?"

https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5123/t/6631/shop/custom.jsp?donate_page_KEY=1694

Despite their own personal losses - homes and family members - and the
loss of office buildings in the city, our partners are helping to
coordinate relief efforts by establishing relief centers in what remains
of their office spaces and sourcing food and other supplies from within
Haiti. They are in a key position to assess the damage and rebuild in the
wake of disaster As Haitians, they are intimately connected to the
individual needs of their local communities.  As advocates of resource
rights and food sovereignty, they know how to make aid work from the
bottom up.

Direct support to local Haitian organizations is especially critical as
the US military and US Agency for International Development (USAID) have
actually restricted the flow and distribution of material aid in Haiti
throughout the past week, which flies in the face of the enormous
outpouring of generosity by ordinary Americans responding to the
devastation. (Read more at
http://www.cepr.net/index.php/press-releases/press-releases/ngos-relief-groups-call-for-distribution-of-water-aid-supplies/).

To make a donation and read updates on the situation, please visit
www.grassrootsonline.org/Haiti.  With your help, we hope to provide our
partners and their communities with real and lasting solutions to this
catastrophe.

Sincerely,

Nikhil Aziz
Executive Director

Ruthless 24/7 Careerism: How You Can Become The Most Important Poet In
America *Overnight* (A Talk By Jim Behrle)

The poet is a social animal above all else: the poet=E2=80=99s art comes second t=
o
the types of important connections the poet can make not just with readers
and an audience, but with editors, curators and people in positions of
institutional power. The poet owes it to the art and to themselves to look
out for #1 at all times. This talk will focus on the kinds of important
community-building activities that are at the heart of all things poetic.
People can be manipulated much like a line of poetry, and a poet must have
complete control of those around them. Jim Behrle will discuss the kinds of
behavior that can help a poet stand out amid the babbling rabble. Poetry ca=
n
be the loneliest journey: we=E2=80=99ll discuss how to feel the warmest bosoms of
constant embrace. Jim Behrle is the author of She=E2=80=99s My Best Friend (Press=

I need an interviewer to interview David Meltzer about his and Michael=20=

Rothenberg's Rockpile poetry and music tour project:

http://www.bigbridge.org/rockpile/?page_id=3D25

An initial pre-tour interview with David has already been done here:

http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/David%20Meltzer.htm

I need another interview (a post-tour one), this time slightly more in-
depth.

Anyone interested?

the universe can be finite from the perspective of an added dimension yet infinite in extent to the inhabitants. this is basically a consequence of the ability to conceive of eternity in an hour and infinity in a grain of sand.

here's a poem (in rhyming couplets) i wrote called alice in flatland that explores it: http://vispo.com/writings/poems/alice.htm . this is one of the first pages i put on my web site.

way back when i was writing poemy poems!

> to quote pope John Paul Satre: Hell is rhyming couplets.

rhyming couplets are an ancient technology. and like any technology of
language, they shape possibilities of language. they open up some
possibilities you wouldn't normally consider and exclude other
possibilities.

they're interesting, as a form of speech and writing, because they're
lively, or can be, if you live with them long enough and share your blood
with them. their liveliness is musical, aphoristic, quickly pointed, sharply
pointed, among other things...they are close to the very form of wit, as it
were. they are a dance of language. a dance is a formal constraint to free
the liveliness of the body into expression within its moves. and gives them
meaning in its language, which is of both how it looks and means as symbol,
body as glyph, and how we know the body feels to dance it.

sarte said hell is other people. hell is not other people. hell is of our
own making. in our relationships with other people. "hell is other people"
is humourous because it makes it easy to blame other people for our own
little hell. which is how we create it.

Some thoughts on dbc's long posts.

What I am interested in is 1) some sort of way to distinguish
different types of relationship to knowledge, experience, source, and
etc. in poetry

and 2) to depreciate the reading of Pound through his misreading of
Fenollosa (though approved by the literary estate, etc. etc.), Olson /
Whitehead, Fulton / whoever.  Not as though I haven't taught these.
Also, to be a little more dismayed about poetics statements and
manifesti, as we are now become our own critics, which is an
interesting thing, I think, but important to remember how weird that
is, and how weird it was even when the author of The Practice of
Outside wrote on Olson and Whitehead.

Some of my most favorite books are offbeat poet's nonfiction (and
fiction), but notably, these are generally about writers and writing:
Z on Shakes., Duncan on HD, Olson on Melville come to mind first.
Some poets' writings for pay, like Ronald Johnson's cookbooks, also
occur to me.

I know, because I'm a writer, that working at the edge of one's
knowledge can be more exciting than chewing over old shoe leather --
although this may not be a position shared by writers with more of a
sense of respect, or "the sacred," or tradition, or whatnot than I
have.  The feminine my eye (true, but...).

But it seems to me that there is a certain approach to poets'
knowledge that gets perpetuated, mostly in academia, and it goes
something like this:  poet x read an essay by scholar y and "ran with"
it, and so everyone who wants to study this poet has to read this
essay.  Rather than actually considering what the poet is doing and
how and why, we end up trying to figure out a bunch of sheer nuttiness
that has nothing to do with anything.

Some things bouncing around about WOMPO and I think New Poetry (thanks
Amy) have been about militarism and the academy and feminism, etc.
And I think looking at Black Mountain that is important too.  The GI
Bill after World War II changed American higher education
dramatically.  Black Mountain was founded, and Harvard got Frank
O'Hara!  But there were not very many female veterans of World War II
who didn't already have postsecondary education in nursing or
aviation, etc., and the state schools expanded, and those originally
for teacher training changed focus, and ...

Very small corrective to your last paragraph, which is I think
exactly right (as is the rest, imho): Black Mountain was founded in
1933. It was strongly influential on the rest of the culture well
before the GI Bill. If anything, decline began to set in after the
war. The Black Mountain that many of us look back to was only its
last several years, when it rarely had more than a hundred students.

Once/If one accepts the idea of a rhyme scheme in poetry, there are a
limited number of ways one can go. The first distinction, it seems to me, is
whether the rhyme structure is conceived within stanzaic units, as in the
sonnet or Provencal song forms, sestinas, etc., or serially, as in the
heroic couplet or the gazel. What a serial rhyming structure does is to
weaken, making more ambiguous, the idea of an ending. The English speakers
usually associate the heroic couplet with its epigrammatic, 18th century,
particularly Popean incarnation. In English, the heroic couplet starts with
Chaucer, who used it first (I think) in *Canterbury Tales* to create a
series of long narratives -basically, "non-poem" poems. The heroic couplet
becomes a means of opening up a poem, away from the concept of a song. One
can regard, in some way, blank verse -the prosody starting with The
Elizabethan Drama- as heroic couplet which has gotten rid of its rhymes.
Interestingly, in *Hamlet *the play within the play is enacted in a
particularly stilted version of heroic couplets creating the illusion of
distance.

The gazel form tentatively deals with the ambiguity, the absence of clear
ending by making the rhyme scheme of the first couplet in a gazel (aa)
different from the rest (ba, ca, da, etc.) and by having the last couplet
mention the poet's name ("I, Hafiz...," etc.) -these devices interjecting,
in Jason's terms," a partly artificial, arbitrary frame. The gazels of many
poets can be recombined, provided they use the same rhyme.

These are a few random thoughts.

ha. that also is humourous in its reworking of "repent". not as in 'get
(our) religion' but as in 'take responsibility' and/or 'live and let live'
and so forth. which is a more reasonable and useful repentance, i'd say.

"hell is other people" is interesting in where it takes us. it doesn't seem
to be meant as a simple statement of fact but as something that's meant to
be questioned. literary statements are sometimes this way. they're often not
so much statements of fact but initiate questioning and following the
possible meanings. often toward deeper understanding of the meaning of the
words used. in this case, humour is in realizing the circuit of the meaning
and what must have been meant but is not, on the face of it, evident. and in
the hidden meaning's agreement with deeper meanings of the words.

this is probably part of what william carlos williams meant when he said "a
poem is a machine made out of words".

three references to sartre, three spellings. the philosopher gets it right,
finally. good to hear from you, jason. it's been a while.

yes, they can be "arbitrary", and usually they do seem a little off, or a
best of bad fit, or simply an unfortunate hijacking of the writer's brain.
but they also can sometimes be almost miraculously just so, a mysterious
gift.

THE IMPERFECT by George Tysh

Drawings by Janet Hamrick      92 pages

$14.00        ISBN 0-935992-33-2

George Tysh co-edited Blue Pig Magazine, with David Ball, in the
1960s. From 1980-91 he directed LINES: New Writing at the Detroit
Institute of Arts. He is also co-editor, with Chris Tysh, of In
Camera, a project devoted to works of the sexual imaginary. The
Imperfect completes a sequence that includes Ovals (In Camera) and
Echolalia (United Artists Books). He currently teaches at the Roeper
School in Birmingham, Michigan.

"Somewhere between taking stock and stocking up these words impinge.
Caught up once more in the eternal return of What can be said? What
not? The scalar groove of all that? Restless, the troubling beauty of
the still unfinished."
Clark Coolidge

"The nine-line poems, the four-line poems, the three-line poems--
though all of them sparkle, it is not for his mastery of form that we
value George Tysh's poetry. Rather we do so in response to his
empathy, almost the single pulse of a muscle, the "dictum to rectum"
effect he writes of in a lovely poem. He knows as much about the way
things look as he does about the needs that went into their making and
abeyance. The poems of THE IMPERFECT are written in Detroit, a "motor
city" outside of which "methyl walls perspire" and "black men and
white men/ walk the streets"--yet they insinuate themselves into the
brains of the feeling everywhere around the earth. I'm a sucker for
this sort of thing. It's like Grace Jones used to say, George Tysh
isn't perfect, but he's perfect for me."

A few correctives. Not every couplet is a heroic couplet. Heroic
couplets don't enjamb, Chaucer's frequently do. All of his poetry,
with the exception of a few lyrics, are in couplets.

I don't know the origin of blank verse, but it's not likely to have
been the couplet, as the unit is a single line. Often enjambed.

It's good to be heard, Jim. Law school has not only eaten my brain but
also my internet social life. My new years resolution was to try to
undo that a bit.

But yes, interesting in relation to WCW on machines is Umberto Eco's
"machina pigra" view of how a text works vis a vis the death of the
author debate. Not only are all poems machines, all texts are
machines, but they are lazy machines that require energy from the
reader, probably poems more so than a lot of other texts. One of the
things that's always bothered me about end rhyme is that it seems to
encourage that laziness transfer from the machine to the reader. You
hit these magic words at the end and in noting them, there's a sense
that the biggest chunk of the work has been done particularly given
the semantic weight that rhyme and positioning at the end of the line
gives, it can make for truly ludicrous composition (see the limerick)
which I think is why ham handed use of form always strikes me as so
unintentionally funny.

I've always thought tho that internal rhyme could be much more fully
developed formally, and I think the arbitrariness of end rhyme in
couplets is really just an artifact of what you're tallking about in
doing it in stanzaic units.

that having been said, I've read a number of free verse translations
of Hafiz in particular that abandoned the attempt to shoehorn the
english into the strict gazel rhyme scheme and I still found them
fairly compelling, although not as good as the truly excellent ones
that manage to preserve form and meaning. That having been said I
think the ghazal is an interesting example of one of those forms
that's hard for native English speakers to cope with. Like Haiku
there's a lot more going on formally than just the prosodic components
what with the requirements about nightengales and other specific
images, or the various content related formal structures in haiku
being about seasons and whatnot.

it's interesting because I don't know that there's much in English
that has a similar requirement. Maybe Limericks, because there usually
has to be a place name. Or Villanelle's with the full repeated line.
One form I've always found really fascinating in this sense is the
lushi because the form is in the intonation not the syllable or meter
so much. I've had some fun trying to do the same thing in English, but
again, it loses something because the (ultimately arbitrary) rules of
the home language simply don't have the same semantic meaning in the
new one.

Mark,

One specifies that heroic couplets must not enjamb because our idea of a
heroic couplet is determined by its 18th century examples. My point is
different, that, within its historical content in English poetry, as opposed
to stanzaic rhyme schemes, Chaucer's iambic pentameter couplets led to
opener forms -very much as in our poetry today we are exploring extended
forms, rather than "well-made," well-crafted poems. My description of blank
verse as heroic couplets stripped of its rhymes -obviously an "unorthodox"
defintion- was to point how the blank verse is an extension of the idea of a
longer, "opener" poetry into drama. Chaucer, it seems to me, establishes the
iambic pentameter as a basic English poetic line. Elizabethan and Jacobean
sonnets (Sydney, Shakespeare, Donne), *Paradise Lost*, *The Prelude*, etc.,
are in iambic pentameter. What interested with in Chaucer's "heroic
couplets" is that they free the English poem from the restraints of a short
lyric. This is important to me because I am interested in the idea of a book
as a single poem -not as a collection of lyrics- how such a poem could be
put together even though, by necessity, it may be constituted by a
convergence of fragments -how the fragment as a poetic unit is completely
different from a "poem." Of course, blank verse or the iambic pentameter
have nor relevance to the labguage of an American poem.


Jason,

I agree with you completely about the problems with the free verse
translations of Hafiz. I have quite a withering review of Daniel Landinky's
"translations" of Hafiz in *The Gift. I* can speak Persian a bit but can not
read it. My understanding of him is through the way a Turkish poet like
Ahmet Hasim uses him or through some excellent Turkish translations. It
seems to me Hafiz is basically a serialist poet with stunning gaps -arcs,
jumps- in the development of his images. I know quite a few Iranians who are
very familiar with his work. The seem to have a peculiar way of reading him.
They just "dip" into his texts, which seems like an ocean, and pick a few
lines. The idea of individual gazels does not seem to exist, a quality I
like a lot. Over the years, I did attempt to do one or two Hafiz
translations into English from their Turkish versions, trying to project
that sense of gap, arcing jumps. You are right. The paucity of rhmes in
English is a big issue, but nevertheless the sound pattern of the gazel
implies a vision in Hafiz's poetry that the translation, I think, needs to
preserve. Here is one of my attempts:

Get up, before your skull is dust ridden
fill up your glass before your grave is sodden

Since since the last motel is the valley of silence
scream to the sky now, before the night is in

Please my sylvan beauty, on your being
do not leave my dust be, before your shadow has been

let the sparkle of the glass tinder existence
the deed of your plot will not before your sin

Reader, don't forget Hafiz's words
take a bath in your tears, then on beauty sing! beauty's wing

Discussing the lushi, by "intonation" do you mean "cadence"? Discussing the
peculiarity of the Turkish syntax, its agglutinative nature, in the
introduction to my *Eda* anthology of Turkish poetry, I do discuss
cadence/the motion of that cadence being the underlying structure of the
music of Turkish poetry.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Catherine:

re Black Mountain there is Martin Duberman's great history  *Black Mountain
An Experiment in Community* which is still in print--

Many many thanks for your thoughts and suggestions/examples re readings.

Basically, I say a big Yes to all you write=97and really thank you=97

I wrote this reply in two sections really as the ideas and examples tumble
forth too fast to keep up=97I thought it interesting that in this discussio=
n
itself, you and I are writing in one direction while others are off on
another=97which in itself might indicate that there=92s a similarity of
interests and thoughts in our thinking with these things-and hence the sens=
e
of an agreement=97

As my reply, I suggest some different ways of thinking abt poetry and Visua=
l
Poetry that I work with.  I don=92t remotely advocate them as being =93the =
way=94
anyone else need do anything=97my main objective is just to present example=
s
of ways different from those you refute in your letter, not to be =93agains=
t
them,=94 but to suggest that there a myriad ways of thinking yet to be
found=97so why only rely on a few--

I apologize if my reply is long, but one needs to cite some examples to sho=
w
how one works, rather than making some statements =93about it.=94 The too
prevalent manifesti you note, perhaps, might be that in place of examples,
one wishes to state something which is =93not yet there=94 but is =93to
come=94=97prophecies=97one might then examine manifesti in terms of  =93pro=
phetic
works,=94 or =93science fictions=94=97or =91speculative fictions=94 and so =
create
another form of thinking abt the manifesti=97the manifesto as a limbo betwe=
en
=93appearance=94 and =93disappearance=94 (manifesti always wanting some thi=
ngs to be
gotten rid of , to be sure!!--)

To =93discover again=94 the futures of the past=97as fictions which can be
examined in terms of being =93documentaries=94 of their own time periods--


I agree very much with you--being an artist/writer, Visual/Sound poet etc--=
i
look to the writings of other poets and artists for ideas, rather than
turning to philosophy etc.  When an artist looks at philosophy, or i shd sa=
y
as this artist looks at it, it is more material  to work with, more words,
phrases, letters, images which one may or not find of use and; lug off as
one does items found in  the streets to be placed into that vast heap of
rubble known as the artists' workshop--basically the same indoors and out,
like Smithson=92s Sites and Non-sites--so on a rainy or sub zero day one ca=
n
continue working "outside" inside=97

This is part of why I love Heraclitus=92 work so much: =93The most beautifu=
l
world is a heap of rubble tossed down in confusion/at random.=94

In another section below I write that Fear is perhaps part of why persons
turn elsewhere than relying on the poems and paintings etc to have ideas in
them.  In a sense, this devalues the respect for the work itself, the
artist, as well as for one=92s own thinking=97the main fear being to go out=
 on a
limb alone=97hence one finds in a time of such endlessly propagandized fear=
 as
this one, an ever greater fear not to conform, or not to refer to some
outside form of =93Authority=94 in thinking re a line in a poem or that gre=
at
blotch in a painting or Visual Poem. For is not a blotch itself a way of
thinking in space and time on what seeing itself is in relation with a
thinking=97perhaps to present as it were some knot, some gnarled impediment
obstinately refusing to =93con-form=94 and so just being =93outside=94
=93interpretation.=94

I am working on several series of Visual Poems re the Cinema Fantome, the
Cinema of Disappearance (name of a book published in France of some of my
works)=97How does one present the ghost of no one?=97(a question from a
forthcoming essay at Jerome Rothenberg=92s Poets and Poetics blog=97re  Non=
writing
and the Unwritten--) Appearance and Disappearance=97in the virtual, in the
actual, in the poem, in the image, in time---in the rubble--

Often  what a "critical' or "philosophic point of view" approaching art may
be doing  is looking for evidences of something outside the art--that is,
some form of system by which to "understand" and "map" the coordinates
within the work. That something "outside" may be an ideology, a philosophy,
a spiritual approach--a historical materialist one, and so forth.  Of
course, to some extent, this method of searching reveals basically only
those things it is able to see in its own terms. What is sought for are not
openings but =91proofs=94 of that particular way of seeing and thinking=92s
=93validity.=94 Validity=97=93value=94=97in all its glory is also part of t=
his quest for
El Dorado. These methods often find very interesting things within the work
of art or poem, while at the same time to some extent they also
"disappear"--by "necessity"--other elements in the process.  What interests
me are the relationships among that those elements  used to create the
"appearance" of the work in terms of the critic's or philosophy=92s
terminologies and what does not appear, what is =93disappeared.=94   Often =
the
part that does not appear is, from an artist's point of view, precisely
where the art or poetry is--between the lines--between the lettres between
the colors and forms--it is out of this seeming blank to others that an
artist works--this "disappeared" area where an actual "resistance" exists.
Resistance because it continually changes=97is =93fugitive.=94

One may, in turn, if thinking in some ways that I do, think of that area
itself as something which in order to remain blank as it were,
in-between--is that it cannot be captured and imprisoned as it were within =
a
doxology of terminology dependent upon a System of thinking or seeing. . It
is something which like Time flows--changes=97=93the basis of art is change=
 in
the universe=94 as the Japanese poet Basho puts it in "learn from the Pine.=
"
       In the Intro to his book Junkie, William S. Burroughs writes that a
Glossary cannot be made the words of Junkie slang, which change from moment
to moment and place to place, because one cannot create a permanent set of
definitions for =93words whose intentions are fugitive.=94

Actually i read much the way you do--artists/poets re others who work in th=
e
same or a different art medium.  For example, lately I have been writing re
the Literature of the No.  Very little exists on this--a handful of texts,
which are part fiction and part non-fiction about other fictions.  The
"founder" of this form of writing being, after all, Bartleby the Scrivener,
who , unlike today's American 'conceptual" poets, stops copying and--"would
prefer not to."
      Also, the issue of "disappearance" in re Non-writing (which is not th=
e
same as the Unwritten)--in terms of both the virtual and the non-reporting
of actual events, vanishing them. Returning to the originary meanings of
avant-garde, which are military, -- war viewed by the early avant-gardes as
Pro by Italian Futurism and Ant- by Dada--a lotof the work i do is with the
direct analogies between the military in terms of technology and  language
with what is being used and done in writing, poetry, Non-writing, the
Unwritten ("The Real War Will Not Get into the Books"--"the real, the
unwritten War" as Whitman writes in *Specimen Days* of the US Civil War).

However, in terms of the Avant-Garde, one finds really that the precedent i=
s
not as an analogy with the military=97but as poetry and war combined in the
same person, the great poet Archilocus, the inventor of so many forms and
genres of poetry and also a paid soldier, a mercenary, really=97who writes
that his two muses are the gods of War and of the Arts, of Poetry=97

In Archilocus one finds an opening into the questions re poetry and war=97j=
ust
as the military invents new technologies for the soldier, so this
soldier-poet invents new techniques for poetry=97including within lyric poe=
try
(the iambic pentameter for example)=97and the satiric, the epigram the
epitaph=97

d
about Mallarme (via bios and letters)  and his ideas re the Book, that grea=

 a
great deal.  Is it itself part of the =93Unwritten=94=97or of =93something =
else=94=97or,
really, of both--  Re the Unfinished there are areas of perception in poetr=
y
and painting both in which, at the very edges of the media,  Mallarme and
Cezanne, working in the same time period,  ultimately found an area where
color and words disappear and what is left are the blank white spaces of th=
e
Unwritten, the Unpainted.  ("my voice goes after what my eyes can't
reach"--Whitman)-These areas, nevertheless are by the poet and painter know=
n
to exist=97they are NOT a =93nothingness=94 ,or  =93a mere failure of perce=
ption=94)  As
George Steiner in his *My Unwritten Books* notes, the unwritten is: =93not =
a
void."

That same area of white might be the White Whale, or the white figure,
immense, which arises among the snows and the near white-out blizzards and
ices of Poe's *The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.
*         I find the most interesting writing re writing is in writing by
writers and other artists. (duh!, in a sense  Inside poems, novels, short
stories, essays, letters, one finds these various pieces which point in
similar directions, are asking similar questions--and, often occurring in
the same time period. , Also, for the current reader/writer--within the
frame work of the current fast shifting technological "visions" of the
world=97there is still the question of what is "vision" itself in terms of
writing as a form of seeing, of hearing, of the tactile, Haptic elements of
existence . . . what it is to see with and in and through words=97and to se=
e
without them=97or with and without light (why I work often literally in the
dark with visual poetry---to teach the hands to see--)
         Time is another element i am working with in the sense of writing
being a form of space/time travel.  For example, i write often of the
"reverse engineering" which occurs in writing and poetry--there is also the
Oulipo concept of this in their concept of a current work, phrase, and
example in the present having often a previous antecedent--which, in turn,
makes of the antecedent a kind of anticipatory plagiarism!
             Emily Dickinson writes of incredible speeds:  "To shut the eye=
s
is travel."  "I have but to cross the room to be in the Spice
Islands,"--this would be perhaps taken as just flights of fancy--rather tha=
n
of the imagination--(an issue Poe argued with Coleridge about)--and, in a
sense of the technology itself of poetry--to join in one small space two
things physically "apparently" immensely distant from each other, by means,
as Emily notes very accurately, of "crossing"--crossing borders into that
poetic imagination in which such travel is a "daily exercise."  A similar
visions is found in Celine's little opening "intro" to Voyage au bout de la
nuit (Journey to the End of the Night)--to shut the eyes, one sees life fro=
m
the other side--and that the imagination is travel.  (That which functions
in terms of Whitman's aching desire in writing--"My voice goes after what m=
y
eyes can't reach"--like a person buried in the rubble of Gaza or Haiti
crying out for days to an unseen world --somewhere--for help--for respite
from not only death but the ultimate loneliness of the solitarily confined)=
.
          Re speeds of writing, think of the famously fast-typing Kerouac,
raving about the fast driving of Neal Cassidy--and what is the ultimate
speed:  "Writing is silent meditation going a hundred miles an hour."
            The first time the daguerreotype and one of its makers appears
in fiction is in Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables--and, for the
first time in a fiction, there is a meditation on the differences between
painting and photography.  The period of time when the scientific
methodologies are first encountering those of painting (vision) and poetry,
writing, and in re travel--is studied today by the Argentinean writer Cesar
Aira via his Humboldt influenced and inspired traveling German painter
investigating the wilds of Southern landscapes in Episode in the Life of
landscape Painter.
          It=92s often presented that there is some kind of dramatic break
between WCW's "Only the imagination is real" in Spring and All and "No idea=
s
but in things, Mr." in Paterson.  If one examines writing actually, the two
are working together simultaneously far more often than one might at first
consider.  The examples i cite of conjunction of the fictional and new
technologies--are those areas where the encounters among the Unwritten and
the Nonwritten occur, the areas of a listening and voice that goes beyond
sight--etc--al these things involve technologies and at the same time the
work of the imagination itself as a form of techne, a technique, for
increasing speeds, time and space traveling etc--its these conjunctions of
the imagination and memory, dream and the actual the Situationists in their
derives encounter in the Paris streets--not a "surrealism" but instead the
actualities found also in the writings of, for the Situationists, Marx.
        I think al of these things may be studied without the need for the
turn to philosophies so often advocated today, which in a way may signal an
anti-imaginative thrust, in that one doesn=92t look into the text itself fo=
r
the evidences of its thought, but elsewhere, which is to say, as Olson--and
Rimbaud--so vigorously argued--"after the fact," as is al Western poetry
following the dictates of Aristotle re metaphor, for example.  In a sense i=
t
is like Emerson's (I paraphrase) "The blank and ruin we see in Nature is
within our own eye."  The blank and ruin seen in texts is in the reader's
eyes, in a sense, in that what is there remains hidden in plain
site/sight/cite, which is another issue i work to address in writing and
visual works--the Unseen before one's very eyes--the Purloined
letter--which, as Leonardo Sciascia points out in using this text in the
Moro Affair--is found by Dupin when he retires to think in absolute
darkness, as with the eyes shut, in order to see that which in broad
daylight is hidden in plain sight.  In a way, the eye needs "development "
in the darkroom of being shut or ensconced in darkness, in order to
"produce" that image in which what is in sharp relief is indeed the
Purloined letter.
         Sciascia's Moro book--and, in the in-print NYRB edition it is
followed by this book--the Disappearance of Majoranna--Sciascia is using
methods from poetry and writing to examine the texts of the letters of
Italian Prime minister Aldo Moro, kidnapped  prisoner of the Red Brigades.
What emerges from these "fictional" approaches to studying "actual texts" i=
s
the "actual story" of Moro's hideous adventure--to the discovery that his
own "friends" have betrayed him and are going to allow him to be executed.
The exposition of what indeed is the "actuality" of these "real events"
emerges by processes taken from fictional precedents.
        What Moro is demonstrating--and he does, again, in amazing ways in
the Disappearance of Majoranna--is the interconnections among not so much
fictions as fictions, but as actualities which converge with those "in
reality" and so "bring to light" those things hidden in plain
site/sight/cite from the "reporters" and from the straight forward "really
true" "sorts of fictions treated as realities in the likes of sheer fiction
or in the mock-docs and mini-docs etc of TV and the Cinema.
         That is, what Sciascia is presenting is a way of working with
methods taken from fiction to examine texts which have actually occurred in
the production of "real historical events."  The letters of Moro examined i=
n
this way "show forth" al that had been "overlooked, turned a blind eye to"
by the daily press, the government, the examining authorities, all of them
shown to be complicit in the very letters they work so hard to ignore and
discredit.  (By implying and then announcing openly that as Moro's letters
change intone, this is "evidence" of his being drugged etc and thus "no
longer Moro" as "we knew and loved him.)
        What started the Iraq War after al but forged letters, the testimon=
y
hallucinated and made up using on line images by an alcoholic Iraqi defecto=
r
in Germany whom the Americans never met, nor saw his actual texts "in
person, in the originals."  All these third rate second hand hearings of
"realities" which become more tainted with each line of demarcation they
cross and ultimately shown to the world as "artists conceptions" rather tha=
n
photographs of "evidences" by Colin Powell in his disastrous speech at the
UN three months before Shock and Awe rained down on the innocent people of
Iraq.  here, the Bush administration makes use of handy "fictional" "made
up" forged and faked elements to instruct a narrative to go to War, making
it impossible any more for anyone to know if the 'evidences" for example of
the nuclear threat in Iran are "real" or "fictional."
          Years ago i recall dimly reading at Ron Silliman=92s blog a mocki=
ng
of persons who believe in the characters of fiction as though they are 'rea=
l
persons."  yet, the "reality" is that for actual "problems, questions"
existing in "reality" it turns out that a character like Dupin aides the
Minister/journalist/friction writer Sciascia--oneof the members of a
committee set up to review the evidences of the Moro case by a govt that
does not want to hear what Sciascia comes up with--_un finding what is
hidden in plain site/sight/cite in Moro's letters--down to the clues as to
his whereabouts with in them, while al the time the Italians have mounted
the largest man hunt in their history, to a degree almost comic-opera--to
find--nothing, no one--
            My point being, again that if one uses the texts of poems and
writings  such as the fictions, essays and letters of poets, artists, there
one finds more than enough ideas to use to think on not only "poetry and
art" as being separate from "reality" but "in reality" part of the fabric o=
f
"actuality."  The appearance of the camera in the 19th century and its
effects in poetry and painting in terms of ways of seeing with in a poem a
story, a painting, as told by the writers, poets, artists themselves, is
just as much real as what are after all the complete fictions which one
studies in Benjamin'
s writings as though his "documents" and "Baudelaire" are more "real" than
the actualities themselves. That is, one need look inside Baudelaire himsel=
f
to find what is it Baudelaire saw, where as instead one is guided by a
figure of fiction--"Benjamin's Baudelaire" to act as a guide.  Here, then
does not the fictional nature of =91reality=92 begins to eat away at the
"documentary" as arranged by the sociologist/philosopher? And yet, though i=
t
is a great work of fiction, one employs Benjamin's "Arcades" as "more real"
than Baudelaire=92s poetry or the poet's own writings re the city and artis=
ts
and the way of seeing within his own time.  I think if one began to treat
Benjamin=92s works as fictions they would began to provide many very amazin=
g
projects for "art" and poetry so to speak. Not to mention a way of seeing
how a German bourgeois thinker of Benjamin=92s time might be essaying to
reconstruct his own Utopian City within the Paris of another time, just as
Joseph Cornell of utopia Drive in new jersey used French posters and journa=
l
images as ways to travel to his utopian Frances with their various 'French
elements" ";literal" and literarily embodied within the boxes he puts them
as "evidences of time and Space travel, objects brought back from "lines of
flight of the imagination."



            I wonder at times if it is not that one might fear addressing
text on its own terms, so it is one reaches for some other text or texts
outside the work to =93explicate it=94 in such a manner that one oneself mi=
ght
then write a text on what so and so and her or his system of thought means
to the poem or painting in question.  That is, one evades or avoids the
tools which are given within the text, and via the artist=92s own writings,
further ideas which one may use to examine the text itself.

It is as though one is not reading the artist=92s thinking seriously at all
unless it is presented in terms of the Great So and So, author of Such and
Such,  In fact, it is as though no only taking the artist=92s own thinking
seriously on their own, but one=92s also. In the current debate re reviewin=
g
there is a similar issue=97of fear=97fear of accountability=97fear of being
=93wrong=94 as compared to the great Pooh Bah=92s dictates etc=97to be agai=
nst the
grain, though so much bruited about and written on and endorsed
rhetorically, is in actuality never much of a good proposition it would see=
m
when judging by the evidences one is presented with.

And=97isn=92t this fear itself not bound up with the Culture of Fear of the
current Surveillance/Security State one lives in? Of what is called abroad
the =93New McCarthyism=94 that exists in the USA today?  Fear generated by
economic insecurity?=97And what fear leads to is Conformity=97to =93speak o=
ut=94 or
=93be against the grain=94 isn=92t so cool anymore perhaps unless being don=
e
rhetorically, in a safe place, far from the fields of struggle which are
before one=92s very eyes. (And before one=92s Virtual eyes so to speak also=
--)
Yet even in supposedly safe places if any actually do exist (ironically I
live in a place actually called this=97A Safe Place=97which of course is
situated in an Unsafe Area--) there is always the fear of =93being found ou=
t=94
to some degree, outed as some secret monster, if one does not go along with
the general line of things.

            Duchamp noted that when he began to real work at his art after =
a
certain point it was to prove wrong the then common saying =93Bete comme un
painter=94=97=93stupid like a painter.=94 The idea being=97the painter pain=
ts but
cannot express in words what it is he does=97therefore, not being in words,
his thought does not exist and therefore he is stupid.

           This is not unlike the saying often found in Offices for the
Social Services systems, to be a warning=97ironically enough, even to the
illiterate=97that =93If it is not in writing it does not exist.=94

           The fear then in reviewing or in writings re poetry, is that eve=
n
the artist must be a dummy re their won art=97so one turns to the
critic-philosopher to find the =93answers, clues=94 and =93secrets=94 of th=
is
wordless presentation.  Ironically the same situation applies to poetry in
that one turns elsewhere to find a system by which to =93interpret=94 the p=
oems,
which in a way implies that the poet themselves did not have ideas
themselves,  and in away, is caught up with an idea that unless in writing
as it were, the poet had no ideas at al but composed as though impregnated
by the Aether. Which in itself is a very interesting issue is it
not=97impregnation by the Aether, or, via the Ear by the Holy Spirit=97lead=
ing
to the =93speaking in tongues=94 aspects of Zaum poetry, andother forms Sou=
nd
Poetry=97with the Aether perhaps being the technological Aether as Joe Milu=
tis
brilliantly writes of it=97=93working it the ideas that were in the air at =
the
time=94=97

Things change if one examines the documentary in terms of fictions and the
fictional itself a form of documentary.  The Walls of separation between
things, peoples, ideas, poems, arts, exist only as much as one in effect
ones them to be there.  If one doesn=92t then one works in ways to undermin=
e
them and doesn=92t bother with their Separations which are a form of dividi=
ng
things up to give one of these precedence or hierarchical =93value=94 over
another.

The great Fear really is that, as Duchamp pointed out, people do not want t=
o
be stupid like painters so they look to others to speak for them re the art=
.
Duchamp setout to show that painting already is thinking in itself. In a
rather bizarre way, he wasn=92t doing this for other artists and poets, but
for the critics, making art even more involving and co-dependent upon
criticism, philosophy und so weiter to =93explain it.=94  How many volumes =
do
not exist re the occult in Duchamp=92s works alone!=97His thought being tur=
ned
into Mysticism in order to again in away prove that painters don=92t think =
but
are =93mystics, alchemists.=94  Part of the reason that Rimbaud leaves poet=
ry is
that he found out to his mortification that in fact poetry was NOT the
=93alchemy of words=94 he had wanted to believe it was.  He had thought by =
this
alchemy to reach the Ultimate Realities=97which, he realizes, are, sadly, w=
hat
is there right before his eyes: the need to get work in a France shipping
its young people out to the colonies for its own Imperialist efforts
following the defeat and humiliation of the Prussian War and the nightmare
terrors opened by the Commune and the use of the State Terror to suppress
it.



Rimbaud had already written the reality of his own life and the reality of
the new Imperialist France in his poetry.  His letters after he stops
writing poetry present phrases and actual landscapes already found years
earlier ii the poems.  This proved one of Rimbaud=92s ideas to actually
=93work=94=97that it is that the poetry of the Future must PRECEDE action r=
ather
than following it.  In Olson this issue comes up again very much, except
that Olson wants to be =93equal to the Real itself.=94 That is poetry is th=
e
action in the Present--not unlike Action Painting-- Rimbaud wants much
speedier form that=97taking after the Greeks in forms=97will write of thing=
s
before they happen.

It is this time element and its use of speeds in writing that is one of the
myriad things that interst me with writing=97and the space to find the
examples and thinking is in the works of poets.

Perhaps the fear is to have not only writing re poetry but a poetry itself
which might be accountable in some manner to anything other than  within th=
e
confines of the page.

Some of my most favorite books are offbeat poet's nonfiction (and

essay.  Rather than actually considering what the poet is doing and
how and why, we end up trying to figure out a bunch of sheer nuttiness
that has nothing to do with anything.

Some things bouncing around about WOMPO and I think New Poetry (thanks
Amy) have been about militarism and the academy and feminism, etc.
And I think looking at Black Mountain that is important too.  The GI
Bill after World War II changed American higher education
dramatically.  Black Mountain was founded, and Harvard got Frank

perhaps understanding that  "a poem is a machine made out of words" or "not
only are all poems machines, all texts are machines" is a useful step toward
understanding that if they are machines, then they are so in the sense that
a piece of software can be a machine. perhaps interesting writing is as
software and simple matter-of-fact writing is simply as data that is not
software but is interpreted by the software of the mind. whereas interesting
writing, such as "hell is other people", which comes to us in the guise of
matter-of-fact writing, actually requires something different from what "my
name is jim" requires to understand it. both require a mind to parse and
interpret them. but "hell is other people" also requires the mind to
understand that hell is not other people and to not stop there, at the
falsification, but to uncover the humour. it is lively writing. lively
writing is not simply data that is meant to surrender to simple
interpretation but, instead, has its own circuits of logic that give us the
mind within a mind thing, ie, we sense the writer's mind in our mind. the
program within a program.

texts are parsed, interpreted, engaged, and, as it were, played, run, or
executed in our minds. the texts are deeply encoded with all the knowledge
of language and the world that the poet has at his/her disposal. they don't
play quite the same in two different minds because semantics is usually
dependent on the mind doing the interpretation.

simple-minded writing that rhymes is ludicrous because it seems to us that
the form is doing the talking, not the writer. bergson's theory of comedy
involved the idea that we feel ok to laugh at somebody when they act like a
machine. when they are not thinking for themselves in the manner we
associate with sentient beings but are on auto-pilot, as it were.

cool that you're going to law school, Jason. it won't eat your brain. though
it may require your attention.

This is a terminological issue.  Mark's right here -- as I know to my cost,
having been smacked over the wrist once for saying what Murat does above.

The heroic couplet is very specifically the rhymed iambic pentameter couplet
*as used by the Augustans* -- Dryden to Sam Johnson -- with several
specifics which distinguish it from earlier and later uses, not just in
Chaucer but  Marlowe, Jonson, Donne, etc., and also say Keats in Endymion,
Hyperion, etc.  Chaucer's couplet line almost ends with him, due mostly to
the loss of the final unaccented 'e', with the iambic pentameter (mostly,
though generally all syllable accent forms) being redefined by Wyatt, on,
and reaching a point of balance in Sidney.  When the Augustans take it up
(from Jonson possibly), they impose their own sets of strictures on
particularly the rhymed iambic pentameter couplet.

If you want a bite-it-and-see example, look at Pope's "translations" of
Donne's Satires.

Dropping this specific meaning of "heroic couplet" diminishes our range of
meaninbgful terms.

Mark is however wrong about the origins of blank verse -- the earliest
example in English is found in Surrey's translation of the Aeneid -- and he
does *that by simply knocking the rhymes off Gavin Douglas's earlier rhymed
couplet version!

Shame that such an act of artistic vandalism should have had such a
productive result.  Surrey's own blank verse may be shit, but I suppose one
has to allow that it lies behind Marlowe, etc.

Robin

i'm not always so sure when i'm actually thinking for myself.
the self is also in  many ways a poem made of words, a selfish machine fearing death and rejection and groping about in a world with this language software it didn't install but can't help but use and manipulate.

the ego often seems to be sawing off the branch on which it is sitting, getting more and more anxious about the coming crash.

by its very definition, the form, in rhyming couplets, is doing the talking. or maybe not so much Doing the talking, but the form seems to determine what it is that can be said.  the constraints seem too limiting.

Hi Robin.

More light to shed? I was thinking (and backchanneling with Murat)
about the larger background. The lacunae in my knowledge will be
immediately apparent. Care to fill some of these holes?

"Got me thinking. Iambic pentameter couplets did become the method of
choice, tho there were contenders. In English pre-conquest narrative
poems were written in unrhymed alliterative verse, which persisted
even into Chaucer's time--Langland was an almost exact
contemporary--but also in intricate continental stanza patterns, as
in the work of the Pearl Poet. Narratives written in rhymed couplets
in tetrameter predate Chaucer by at least a generation--I'm thinking
of Sir Orfeo, a personal favorite. Marie de France was writing in
rhymed tetrameter couplets in French at the English court at least a
hundred years before Chaucer, and Chaucer knew her lais by heart,
apparently. On the continent narrative was often written in elaborate
stanza patterns--Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parsifal. I don't remember
what form Chretien de Troyes used--would be good to know--big
influence on Chaucer. Boccaccio wrote his Filostrato, the source of
Chaucer's Troilus, in stanzas.

None of these were as flexible as Chaucer's rhymed pentameter. The
only competitor in that regard must be Dante's terza rima, but it
didn't catch on, even in Italy, as far as I know."

Best,

Mark

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

My new blog, "Poetica: Critiques & Reviews of Poetry & Poetics," =
features a review of Frances Presley's recent book of poems, "Lines of =
Sight." (Shearsman Books. Exeter UK, 2009.) The blog also contains links =
to my past reviews and critiques.

I began this blog because newspapers, where I've published reviews over =
the years, are allowing less space for serious book reviews. As for =
journals, where I've also published over the years, my work now usually =
falls in-between their niches, or is too long for the space they assign =
to reviews. Thus, I've decided to periodically publish a review, or =
critique a poem, in the format of a blog.

Even though I do respect, and admire, the self-publication of poetry, =
because I have a limited amount of time, and there are so many books =
being published, I can only consider those sent to me by  publishers; =
e.g., books that have gone through the process of outside readers and =
independent editorial decisions.

yes, well, that is an understandable perspective. perhaps rhyming couplets
are to poetry what the straight jacket is to fashion. but then there are the
houdinis of rhyming couplets. or you could think of them as being unto a new
pair of jeans, to loosen up a bit. at first they're stiff and you almost
walk like a cardboard cutout and worry about your manhood. but they do
eventually loosen up and perhaps the fit is good. it takes a while, though.
and it takes longer with rhyming couplets.

not that it's my thing, but i think poets who experiment with different
constraints may come to see the er logic in bondage. perhaps bondage is to
sexuality what constraint is to poetry. it gives it a particular form,
different from the usual. it can have a certain drama to it.  it limits
possibilities and opens up some other ones. i wouldn't think that even
afficionados of bondage would take it as a steady diet, though. and so with
rhyming couplets.

Some thoughts on dbc's long posts...

and how weird it was even when the author of The Practice of
Outside wrote on Olson and Whitehead.

I know, because I'm a writer, that working at the edge of one's
knowledge can be more exciting than chewing over old shoe leather --
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think Blaser's essay on Olson/Whitehead is quite useful in understanding what Olson got from Whitehead and how we may use it ourselves and move forward into new realms previously unoccupied or even charted.

Like Fred Wah does, as related in http://www.wlupress.wlu.ca/press/Catalog/cabri.shtml

Far from chewing old shoe leather, I think this shows that Canadians generally have a leg up on innovation over their South-of-the-Border counterparts and have done much more with poetics that started here, but were not fully understood or acted upon.

Maybe it was in some movie    maybe it
was in a dream but I seem to remember
Howard Zinn as tour guide on a double-decker
bus crusing our country our world    speaking
on how "Columbus was met by Arawah
men and women, naked, tawny, full of wonder...
just look, will you, at what happened..."
"Down this way we have," he'd tell us, "To the
Empire and its people... To Teddy Roosevelt
welcoming any war  any war at all   anywhere"
Then we'd continue through "CarterReaganBush
that consensus protecting corporate interests
in any place in any where at all time any old
right-wing tyranny abroad..."        And
just when the prospect for our times of turmoil
also seemed an insurmountable struggle... Howard
Zinn, microphone in hand beamed through
the tour bus's P.A.    "There's still inspiration,
I'm still inspired!"

if a rhyming couplet didn't exist, would it be necessary to invent one?

i'm not always so sure when i'm actually thinking for myself.
the self is also in  many ways a poem made of words, a selfish machine fearing death and rejection and groping about in a world with this language software it didn't install but can't help but use and manipulate.

the ego often seems to be sawing off the branch on which it is sitting, getting more and more anxious about the coming crash.

by its very definition, the form, in rhyming couplets, is doing the talking. or maybe not so much Doing the talking, but the form seems to determine what it is that can be said.  the constraints seem too limiting.

perhaps understanding that  "a poem is a machine made out of words" or "not only are all poems machines, all texts are machines" is a useful step toward understanding that if they are machines, then they are so in the sense that a piece of software can be a machine. perhaps interesting writing is as software and simple matter-of-fact writing is simply as data that is not software but is interpreted by the software of the mind. whereas interesting writing, such as "hell is other people", which comes to us in the guise of matter-of-fact writing, actually requires something different from what "my name is jim" requires to understand it. both require a mind to parse and interpret them. but "hell is other people" also requires the mind to understand that hell is not other people and to not stop there, at the falsification, but to uncover the humour. it is lively writing. lively writing is not simply data that is meant to surrender to simple interpretation
but, instead, has its own circuits of logic that give us the mind within a mind thing, ie, we sense the writer's mind in our mind. the program within a program.

texts are parsed, interpreted, engaged, and, as it were, played, run, or executed in our minds. the texts are deeply encoded with all the knowledge of language and the world that the poet has at his/her disposal. they don't play quite the same in two different minds because semantics is usually dependent on the mind doing the interpretation.

simple-minded writing that rhymes is ludicrous because it seems to us that the form is doing the talking, not the writer. bergson's theory of comedy involved the idea that we feel ok to laugh at somebody when they act like a machine. when they are not thinking for themselves in the manner we associate with sentient beings but are on auto-pilot, as it were.

cool that you're going to law school, Jason. it won't eat your brain. though it may require your attention.

on BrownPaperTickets.com
as of MONDAY, FEBRUARY 1, AT 1 PM

The events will happen at Unity Temple April 17, 2010

Poet/Activist Sam Hamill at Unity Temple in Oak Park, IL
Saturday, April 17 for Workshop (2-4 pm) and Reading (8 pm)

“An Evening of Poetry with Sam Hamill”-- Poet, Publisher, Translator,
Founder of Poets Against War, at the 3rd Saturday Coffeehouse, April 17.
Doors open 7:30; program begins at 8 ($9).

***For this very Special 3rd Saturday Coffeehouse—there will be no open
mic in April***

At 2 – 4 p.m. that same day we are proud to present “The Practice of
Poetry:  an intimate discussion/workshop with Sam Hamill,” an intimate
conversation/workshop ($20--limited enrollment).

This is a unique opportunity to spend time with one of the major poets and
cultural forces of our time. Sam Hamill is the author of more than forty
books, including fifteen volumes of original poetry (most recently
Measured by Stone and Almost Paradise: New & Selected Poems &
Translations); four collections of literary essays, including A Poet’s
Work and Avocations: On Poetry & Poets; and some of the most distinguished
translations of ancient Chinese and Japanese classics of the last
half-century. He co-founded, and for thirty-two years was editor, at
Copper Canyon Press. He taught in prisons for fourteen years and has
worked extensively with battered women and children.

Mr. Hamill was invited to the White House by Laura Bush in 2003 for an
evening celebrating American poetry on the eve of the invasion of Iraq,
the president having just outlined his plans for “shock and awe.” Hamill
declined the invitation and extended his own invitation to fellow poets to
“speak for the conscience of our country.” The result was Poets Against
War, www.poetsagainstwar.net and the compilation of over 20,000 poems in
opposition to war.
Both the afternoon and evening events will be held at Unity Temple, 875 W.
Lake St. in downtown Oak Park.

Tickets are available from Brown Paper Tickets online starting Monday,
2/1/20 at 1 pm.
It is advisable to acquire tickets early as SEATING IS LIMITED.

Sorry, we cannot take reservations, make refunds or hold tickets for
either event.  For more information: 708-660-9376.  This event is funded
in part by Poets & Writers, Inc. and the Social Mission Committee of the

There's bondage and bondage. For a lot of the leather crowd it is a
steady diet--the only way they can get off. Same may be said for
rhyme--most of us probably do it sometimes, but for some it's the
only way they can get off. Which is no reflection, in either arm of
this odd analogy, on the resultant quality.

Mark,

I think you can make a case for the ballad form (iambic tetrameter, abcb quatrains) as the most durable of rivals in English to rhymed pentameter couplets.

Hi Robin.

More light to shed? I was thinking (and backchanneling with Murat) about the larger background. The lacunae in my knowledge will be immediately apparent. Care to fill some of these holes?

"Got me thinking. Iambic pentameter couplets did become the method of choice, tho there were contenders. In English pre-conquest narrative poems were written in unrhymed alliterative verse, which persisted even into Chaucer's time--Langland was an almost exact contemporary--but also in intricate continental stanza patterns, as in the work of the Pearl Poet. Narratives written in rhymed couplets in tetrameter predate Chaucer by at least a generation--I'm thinking of Sir Orfeo, a personal favorite. Marie de France was writing in rhymed tetrameter couplets in French at the English court at least a hundred years before Chaucer, and Chaucer knew her lais by heart, apparently. On the continent narrative was often written in elaborate stanza patterns--Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parsifal. I don't remember what form Chretien de Troyes used--would be good to know--big influence on Chaucer. Boccaccio wrote his Filostrato, the source of Chaucer's Troilus, in stanzas.

None of these were as flexible as Chaucer's rhymed pentameter. The only competitor in that regard must be Dante's terza rima, but it didn't catch on, even in Italy, as far as I know."

Best,

Mark

When the Augustans take it up (from Jonson possibly), they impose their own sets of strictures on particularly the rhymed iambic pentameter couplet.

interesting:

bondage & rhyming couplets
work well together.

they seem to enjoy their constraints.
very interesting.

hmmm.

yes, well, that is an understandable perspective. perhaps rhyming couplets are to poetry what the straight jacket is to fashion. but then there are the houdinis of rhyming couplets. or you could think of them as being unto a new pair of jeans, to loosen up a bit. at first they're stiff and you almost walk like a cardboard cutout and worry about your manhood. but they do eventually loosen up and perhaps the fit is good. it takes a while, though. and it takes longer with rhyming couplets.

not that it's my thing, but i think poets who experiment with different constraints may come to see the er logic in bondage. perhaps bondage is to sexuality what constraint is to poetry. it gives it a particular form, different from the usual. it can have a certain drama to it.  it limits possibilities and opens up some other ones. i wouldn't think that even afficionados of bondage would take it as a steady diet, though. and so with rhyming couplets.

Dunno about filling in, but I'll add some comments to what you said to Murat
below.  We really need the Birk in on this, but I don't think he does
Buffpo.

This shows the late 14thC has a three-way split -- Chaucer writing in London
in syllable-accent metre, Langland arrived from the East Midlands and
writing in London for a (different?) London audience, in 'loose'
alliterative stress metre (from Aelfric rather than Beowulf?  Or is this
just my own daft idea?), and the Gawain Poet writing in the West Midlands
for a local courtly audience in 'strict' alliterative stress metre.

Historically, the Gawain Poet dead ends -- only one extant MS (there are
something like 60+ for both Piers Plowman, counting all four [if you accept
the Z-text as independent] versions, and the Canterbury Tales].  Except in
Scotland, where the alliterative body interspersed by the bob-and-wheel
stanza persists till oh I suppose the 15thC.  (I can't be more specific in
terms of texts, as none ever caught my interest, but I think there are at
least ten to fifteen.)  But stress-alliterative metre generally lasted *much
longer in Scotland than in England as a viable form -- think Dunbar's
"Tretis of the Twa Meriit Wemen and the Wedo" in the early fifteenth
century.

> Narratives written in rhymed couplets in tetrameter predate Chaucer by at

The earliest would be The Owl and the Nightingale, late 12th/early 13thC, in
eight syllable couplets:

(From WIKI, where I just went to check the date:

"The poem is rhymed octosyllabic couplets (generally iambic tetrameter, with
most verses ending with a ninth unstressed syllable). This form shows the
influence of Old French poetry and precociously anticipates the graces of
Chaucer." )

This makes sense, as you'd think the older four-beat stress line would
translate more easily into an octosyllabic rather than a pentameter
(couplet) line.

But the four-beat stress line vs. the five beat syllable-accent line was
still a problem as late as Wyatt.  One way of looking at his first version
of the sonnet "Farewell, Love, and all thy laws forever," "Now farewell love
and thy laws forever" in Devonshire, is to see the earlier text as a mix of
four-stress lines and pentameter lines, with all the four-stress lines being
revised out (with the exception of "Hath taught me to set / in trifles no
store" which only gets postumously revised by Grimald or whoever prints the
poem in Tottel's Miscellany) by the time it's nicely written down in
Egerton.

Dunno about Italy, but terza rima is virtually impossible to write
successfully in English -- Wyatt succeeded in his Psalms translations and
the Satires,  but Gascoigne only manages it by (so to speak) cheating.  (I
loathe Shelley so much that I'm going to pretend his Triumphi translations
didn't exist.)  Not enough rhymes in English, so terza rima can function as
an open ended (continuous)/narrative form (in Dante, as you point out) in
Italian but not in English, where we're down to either the pentameter line,
rhymed or unrhymed, OR the four-beat alliterative stress line.

When it comes to the latter 'today', there's the unsuccessful example of
Auden in _The Age of Anxiety_, and its more recent successful use by Francis
Berry in "Morant Bay" and _Ghosts of Greenland_.  Oh and of course Pound in
Canto 1.

(Leaving aside translation, usually Beowulf, of course.  Edwin Morgan to
Seamus Heaney ...)

That ignores stanzaic forms, where obviously the ballad would figure
largely.  And the various spins of taking a chopped sonnet and using it as
the stanza form of a longer text -- Greville does this in the various
Treatises, using the last quatrain + couplet of the sonnet as his basic
stanza, and Keats sort-of similarly in the Odes.

Enough.  Was trying to find where I'd put the file of an attempt to
construct a variorum text of "The Black Procession" (on the principle that
cant texts deserve to be treated with the same scholarly responsibility as
canonical texts) when I noticed this, and felt obliged to respond.  <g>

I think Murat was talking about flexibility for verse narrative.
There have certainly been some pretty long narrative ballads--The
Ancient Mariner, for one. To put words in his mouth, the form because
of its greater structural demands constrains the manner in which the
story is told more than couplets or blank verse. Or so imaginary Murat thinks.

Ooops!!!  -- early SIXTEENTH century, of course.

Yet once more I trip up over calling the period 1500-1599 by the wrong name.
Am I the only person who finds calling the fifteen hundreds "the sixteenth
century" counter-intuitive?

awesome.

a postmodern moment which is lyrical.

Recently, I've become interested in writing poetic responses to contemporary
dance performances I've attended. Knowing that there is a word, 'ekprasic',
for poetry written in response to visual art, is there a word for poetry
written in response to the art of movement?

=93AND THERE IN THE DISTANCE,
nothing./A line of houses one can hardly
make out/through the white of snow and
sun.=94 These lines from =93The Fog,=94 by the
Cuban poet Eugenio Florit, could double as
a sketch of the view from the north, and from
within Cuba itself, of recent Cuban literature.
The US embargo has corrupted our
view of the island, and Castro=92s censors have
stifled the publication of writing that departs
from state-sanctioned optimismo. I found
=93The Fog=94 in The Whole Island: Six Decades of
Cuban Poetry, edited by Mark Weiss (California;
paper $29.95). Not since the 1982 publication
of Paul Auster=92s Random House Book
of Twentieth Century French Poetry has a bilingual
anthology so effectively broadened
the sense of poetic terrain outside the United
States and also created a superb collection
of foreign poems in English. There is
nothing else like it. Weiss presents generous
selections of work by fifty-five poets from
Cuba and its diaspora; though ostensibly an
anthology, The Whole Island is a gathering of
individual voices (among them those of the
twenty-two translators who contributed to
the project). In =93On Three Photos of Mella,=94
Francisco de Ora=E1 offers a riposte to Julio
Mella, a founder of Cuba=92s Communist Party
and a disapproving superego: =93I only know
that, deep down, I would have wanted to be
let loose in the garden,/and that the garden
would grow and become the whole world.=94
Seeing through the fog (what Damaris Calder=F3n
calls this =93sad business/this playing at
being perfect=94), Weiss has located the whole
island=92s many imaginary gardens.

Ekphrastic is the right word for a poem reponding to a painting.

I am preparing a critical bibliography for John Wieners.  If you're
aware of any texts -- from the peer-reviewed academic article, to
send-ups by friends in ephemeral small magazines -- can you please
back-channel citations?  I am aware of a few things (by Andrea Brady,
Bruce Andrews), but would like to be as comprehensive as possible.

Thanks,
Robert Dewhurst

Recently, I've become interested in writing poetic responses to contemporary
dance performances I've attended. Knowing that there is a word, 'ekprasic',
for poetry written in response to visual art, is there a word for poetry
written in response to the art of movement?

Mark, Robin,

I just went back to re-read parts of "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." What
I noticed is that the stanza structure and the rhyme scheme are very loose.
Stanzas are four, five and sometimes six lines. Also the rhymes are very
irregular. It seems to me Coleridge is attempting to create in this poem
also an archaic or distant tone (many of his contempraries complained about
it) what he calls in *The Biographica* "the supernatural." In fact, it seems
(here I am relying on Wiki) "The Rime" was part of a project conducted by
Coleridge and Wordsworth together. Coleridge was going to write a poem after
the supernatural ("the shades of the imagination") and Worsdworth's
experiment was going to focus on "everyday life."

It seems Wordsworth (and the majority of his contemporaries) did not
particularly like "The Rime" though he partly changed his opinion later on.
He considered Coleridge's stanzaic form in "The Rime" "unsuitable for a long
poem."

It seems by Wordsworth and Coleridge's time complicated stanza forms
-particularly in a long poem- looking to the past or to the supernatural
(the sublime) represented -to paraphrase Jim- the S&M of English poetry,
whereas the line coming from Chaucer became the straight sex (I wonder which
sex is using more the straight jacket?).

When Pound creates another pivotal change in English poetry, particularly
with his translation of "The Seafarer," he is looking back to earlier than
Chaucer, to alliterative verse, as Mark mentions, to "the road not taken."
Alliteration is built on consonants. The "natural" music of Victorian poetry
is built around assonance, in other words, vowels. Pound shifts the focus,
consequently, what poetic sound/music is.

Also, the discontinuity implicit complicated stanza forms makes it a fertile
ground for long poems at least partly built around the idea of collage -the
underlying unity among discontinuities which a long poem suggests.

Ciao,

Murat

>Peter Ganick said:
*chalk editions* – usually poetry attempts to conquer time and insert an
immortality-factor to its texts – this possibility has reverted against
itself recently – the physical book is a dinosaur – we, at chalk editions,
don’t like this event, however, it is the reality of a *now*, almost into
the second decade of the 21st decade – hardcopy books are expensive to
produce and purchase, soon, hardcopy books will be the present tense for
either the rich elite, or collectors – digital *paper and ink* are improving
as we speak, the quality of reading on a computer screen [such as amazon’s
kindle device] is improving – screen technology [for computers] is improving
as well
*we are poets: we come and go with the wind. free.*

i note that you are doing POD (print on demand) with your Blue Lion Books.
And that your criterion for publishing a Blue Lion POD book includes that it
be over 250 pages. could you elaborate on this, please? what sort of
decisions do you make in whether to keep it digital or offer it in POD? is
it just the size of the book or are there other considerations?

certainly a 250 page ebook, on contemporary monitors, is completely
unreadable. but is a 100 page ebook any more readable? well, yes, by 150
pages. but, still, reading 100 pages of a book from a monitor is not
something any of us would regard as an enjoyable experience.

i don't see books as dinosaurical, really. POD seems like a fairly
cost-effective way to publish paper books for small publishers, doesn't it?
you've been involved in POD, so you should be an authority on this one.

perhaps devices such as the Kindle will replace books if they are pleasantly
readable, which i hear they are, and if they are as easily browsable as a
book is and if you can get any book you want on them quite easily. all of
which seems doable. the hardest part has apparently been getting the screen
to be readable, which monitors barely are. readable literary sites mix it
up. they offer a variety of media. words, pictures, sounds, interactive
works, processes, activities. too much reading on a monitor is just a grind.
we need to understand media. readable literary web sites take writing in
directions it hasn't been able to go, formally, before. they use what is
really engaging about the computer experience. not just sitting in front of
a monitor reading a hundred pages of type trying to pretend it's a book.

what is displayable on a Kindle? just type? or type and pictures? how about
sounds? animation? video? interactivity?

From: Alan Sondheim <sondheim@panix.com>
To: dance@nytimes.com
Subject: To the Editor: (in response to Macaulay's review 1/22/10)


To the Editor:


I'm writing to respond to Alastair Macaulay's review of our performances,
in the January 22 Dance Section.

I've never responded to a review, negative or positive, before, but
Macaulay's demands it. The review is a diatribe, neither a description,
nor an analysis. No one reading it would have the slightest idea of the
evenings themselves. We deserve better.

Macaulay's dismisses the music/song as follows: "Meanwhile, he is
accompanied by two colleagues. Alan Sondheim plays a variety of stringed
instruments; Azure Carter sings her own songs in a series of pretty frocks
and petticoats, and even dances a little. Both are entirely trivial." This
is sexist and obviously insulting. He may not have liked the music, but
this says nothing. (I should mention that there were dancers, musicians,
and choreographers in the audience - some quite well known, etc. - and
none of them had this reaction; far from it. We also played to large
houses, in spite of the review.)

Macaulay also dismisses Foofwa d'Imobilite's name as follows: "Mr.
d'Imobilite has provided several pages of accompanying literature. These
cover his 'conceptual libretto' for 'Musings,' the wordplay within its
title and his own name, his methodology and the inspiration behind
'Involuntaries.' It's all clever, but, like his name, damnably arch and
contrived." This is stupid and ad hominem. The "several pages" were
written by d'Imobilite, Carter, and myself, by the way - Macaulay
apparently paid no attention to the distinction.

He likewise paid no attention to the half-hour video, intended as an
introduction to Involuntaries; he paid no attention to the lighting of
Musings, which was computer-controled and designed as a dance performance
in itself; and he apparently paid no attention to the details of
Involuntaries itself. He thinks otherwise: "Mr. d'Imobilite's choreography
for himself consists almost entirely of spasms." I've seen spasms, and
this is as nonsensical as saying that Michael Jackson's choreography is
just prancing about. In fact, the sections of Involuntaries are quite
distinct from each other, as the audience understood.

I don't know Macaulay, and don't want to, but he appears to favor an ugly
form of connoisseurship I've seen far too often. Rather than attempting to
understand the work (reading the program notes? watching the video?
watching the performance itself?), the performance is used as an excuse
for yet another agenda - in this case, I assume, a return to ballet or
traditional Cunningham. The readers of the Times deserve far better than
this. The Times stands alone, in a sense, and for better or worse,
functions as an arbiter, if not of taste, at least of what one might see
of an evening. And for that, we need analysis and care, and at least
someone who loves downtown dance, someone who understands it, to review
these occasions. It's difficult enough to work on a kind of edge without
being slammed by relatively unresponsive critics in the Times.

Thank you.

Sincerely Yours,

Alan Sondheim sondheim@panix.com 718-813-3285

The Last Word: First Blurts on John Wieners

=20

TWO PROPOSALS FOR A TALK ON=2C AND STANDING IN FOR "A STATEMENT" ON=2C THE =
LATER POETIC WORK OF JOHN WIENERS

1

The Switch from the Extensive and Causal=2C to Permissions Toward the Penet=
rant and Creatively Received: Transformation from Romantic Expression of De=
sire's Movement to the Classical Proportionality of Proposing Presence and =
Allowing Apparition=2C Intuition and Disguise in the Later Work of John Wie=
ners

Active distinctions made via Dionysian individuated causality in the person=
al lyric as extending to=2C yet in contradistinction with=2C the interpenet=
ration of all objects and persons Orphically=2C evolve from a plethora of r=
eceived names=2C through dream and memory=2C as these become motivations to=
ward persistent shifts of more ordinal identity=2C your legal person=2C pas=
sport stamp=2C nationality=2C the brass rails of your neighborhood barroom =
and standard city hall=2C

and these literal and constant shifts constitute the inversion in the poeti=
c work of John Wieners=2C from the testamental and experiential lyric opera=
tions constituting verse composed upon feeling=2C waylaid by verb forms tha=
t give authenticity to the Self mutated by its own active yet inadequate at=
tempts at definition=2C where there is otherwise in the later work=2C an am=
ply transmuted disposal

less the result of an individuated and active disposition toward The Real=
=2C but an on-going receivership=2C to be left open to penetrant desire=2C =
in poetic disposition=2C not revelent spirit alone=2C but that sexual insti=
nct be included throughout bus station=2C spare east coast New England sing=
le rooms and pacings out upon the Fens in perfectly empty hunger toward req=
uition. So it is with Mister Wieners' later

auto-de-fe in heresy=2C the persistent brand-mark of his sexuality=2C remar=
king the desired stain upon his face in four-dollar blow-jobs=2C and associ=
ational instances of being in wont of=2C more lately=2C in their aftermath=
=2C Dante Sweeting Watching Upon Virgin Appearances of Virgil's Beatrice=2C=
 the guide of "feminine phenomenological apprehension" modally=2C as named =
references to equal parts glamour and mundanity=2C inter-penetrant and tran=
sitory=2C out of Hollywood and high society=2C Miss Barbara Hutton=2C Dr Ja=
cqueline Onassis=2C or in Duke of Windsor Inaugural Dawn Acceptance Speech =
whispered as stars blink out over Islip State=2C in long nights=2C incarcer=
ated upon Long Island.

So the "talk" I would give=2C related to the above circumambulations=2C is =
in the nature of revealing the shift from individuated lyric to collagist t=
actics against any final settlement upon frontiers of what Wieners denotes =
as income=2C desire=2C security and truth - as well the perpetual ennui the=
se each imply - the Final Identity through which to enquire upon jealousy's=
 lifetime attenuations=2C stolen as these are from the likes of Marx=2C Ein=
stein=2C Darwin and Freud=2C the shift from Dionysos to Apollo's Nine notwi=
thstanding.

Consequent texts will primarily include Wieners' post-1970 collagist work=
=2C as well as=2C by compare=2C more ordinal lyric work from the 1960s. The=
 above is an addendum and extention of a paper proposed for a previous Conf=
erence=2C unfinished and undelivered=2C provisionally titled:

"Singular Conviction Parallel Sunset Boulevard upon Limbic Rise=2C Clairvoy=
ant and/or Crestfallen=2C Animates Boston=2C Bavaria and Babylon in terms o=
f 4000 Ladies-In-Waiting=2C or=2C The Integral Life: Notes Regarding John W=
ieners' Magna Carta=2C Behind The State Capitol=2C or=2C Cincinnati Pike=2C=
 and Related Works."

For Wieners' life's work=2C continuous attentions and jeu de mots in addend=
um=2C ignotum per ignotius=2C is of the essence=2C as necessities of menial=
 repetition=2C independence=2C and hotel legerdemain.


2

The initial impetus to John Wieners' poetics can in part be located in his =
own statement about it - "Address of the Watchman to the Night" - in The Ma=
gazine for Further Studies (Buffalo 1965). In it he says that the prostitut=
e=2C dope addict=2C thief and pervert were the heroes of his world=2C and t=
hat he had to become each in turn until he knew them all.

Yet this is mere topical fancy=2C what his poems are to be initially "about=
". The more commensurate and sensible source of Wieners' lyric voice is the=
 attitude within this material that maintains a heat otherwise specific to =
the terms of the lyric itself=2C rather than the "night people" it so desir=
ously probes.

In this=2C the primum mobile is love=2C which=2C first=2C obtains to the co=
ndition of the whole of space=2C the void=2C the ultimate=2C circular=2C cu=
rving rhythm of human experience that comprises a rearward time vector=2C b=
ack to the past=2C and then projects it forward multi-directionally=2C the =
vectors extending until they go completely circular=2C which concludes the =
lyric voice and opens the possibility of myth and its attending sense of co=
smos and its expression as epic. So that these persons

become the flanks and withers of a very old sense of animals in their movem=
ents as being causal of the music of the spheres. In this=2C love would be =
to epic as home is to the domestic=2C living in the ethic of desire. Wiener=
s' early work=2C the lyric of pathos=2C seems in hindsight preparation for =
his magnum opus=2C Behind the State Capitol=2C or Cincinnati Pike=2C in whi=
ch sensible lyric has been supplanted by Dionysian frenzy=2C to burn with s=
uch heat that the attending sense of cosmos remains forever single=2C that =
it participates in a whole. That it holds=2C unto itself=2C without requiri=
ng a determining "center".

In this=2C Wieners allows himself=2C especially in the later work=2C to be =
penetrated by the magic of others' experience and identity=2C as for exampl=
e=2C Blake arranging for his own demonic possession by Milton. And=2C inter=
estingly=2C throughout the later work there are extraordinary congestions o=
f person=2C place and thing related to this unlikely genetic interchange=2C=
 especially with critical and appreciative views to Hollywood stardom=2C cu=
ltural status and political repute.

This alone=2C along with the often stiffly-driven formality of Wieners' lan=
guage=2C would lead one to the conclusion that as his poetic career progres=
sed=2C the work became increasingly complex. But I would propose otherwise =
that it simply becomes more animated=2C that the lyric "continuous metaphor=
 for a feeling" in fact does encircle an emotional condition which then ope=
ns into the possibility of a universe conceived as simple and whole=2C as i=
t may be expressed and determined by the wholeness of language's capacity f=
or love. And Wieners seems predestinarian in that sense - that it is an ind=
ividual's destiny to fulfill the universe's capacity for love.

Depends what you mean by reading.  I get the feeling with ebooks that
scanning might be a more appropriate concept & I think there is a lot
scanning going on.  Personally I'm not able to read more than 4 or 5
pages of text in a row on the screen before my eyes go buggy.

I'm not exactly sure what buggy eyes are, mIEKAL, but I read quite a bit
more
onscreen than off- nowadays, and my eyes definitely benefit from my being
able
to enlarge onscreen type, not to mention being able to darken or lighten the
screen as needed. Maybe you're not old enough to have your hands cramp up
while holding magazines, newspaper, even some books. Of course, a little
more
heat in the house might help with that, but . . .

the first time I met john wieners he asked, Are you a Medici?
No? Did I meet you at Georgia O'Keefe's house? He was sweet & I was thrilled
bec I had loved his poetry; instead of my praising him, he complimented me.

Clearance Sale.

Go to: http://poeticks.com/the-runaway-spoon-press-catalogue-2/

Top of the Page.

25 titles, some dating back before 1990, for only $50 (payable through Paypal or by mail).  Each is about 4' by 3".  Saddle-stitched.  Some are a little faded (but readable); some, I'm sure, must be collectors' items by now, or eventually will be.  Good quick course in what's been going on in the Otherstream over the past two decades.

None ever won a prize!

As a poet who draws greatly from my dance background, I sometimes use
the word somapoetics. Soma and somatics draw from an internal sense of
motion, not from watching it on stage.
