Wow, that sure worked fast.  The room posted yesterday is taken.  Thanks
vast-fingered EPC!

The Bernadette Mayer Fund is running low.  Thank you all who donated!
Bernadette is still unable to work after the cerebral hemorrhage she
suffered 2 1/2 years ago, though she has started teaching her workshop at
The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church again.  She is writing again, and
has several forthcoming books, Another Smashed Pinecone (United Artisits)
and  The Studying Hunger Journals (Hard Press.)  Sonnets, the first
publication of Tender Buttons press, is slated to be reprinted in the Fall!


If you would like to make a contribution, please send it to John Giorno's

<<Does there need to be a polarity between print & performance?
Of course there ARE differences.  But what if you looked
at a written/printed poem as a musical score.  Then writing might
be an aid to composition (in quantity large or small).  & writing might
make POSSIBLE multi-dimensional performances, as opposed to one-time
"unrecorded" hits (or one-time recorded hits).
   I like the idea of a further integration of print & performance.  On
every level.  Real poems never stand against time - they re-express time
& enrich time.  Why are present needs IMMEDIATE?  Because they are
impoverished
- they lack the meta-time represented in poetry & memory.  Does so-called=

experimental poetry renounce memory & history in order to mimic (&
therefore
"play a role" in) so-called "present needs"?  Somebody (Stevens) said the=

purpose of poetry is to help people live their lives (do I have that
right?).
We know what impoverishment is & that it asks for a response.  Is mimicry=

& participation the only response?  Maybe it's a better response than
the offer of elite traditions & values.  But it might not be the only
response.  Ignoring history & what's been done (in print, in performance)=

is an experiment in conformity (the flip side of uncritical imitation).>>=


Henry Gould

 =

almost all poetry worth the effort is an experiment - i know all this has=

been said before but it was worth reiterating I think to be sure we are
talking about the same thing - and then there is *experimental* - i reall=
y
don't think memory & / or history should be rejected and i cannot see tha=
t
doing so would involve one more in the present... i think it wld exclude
one in the present in any effective way because, yes, it wld at least
encourage conformity

_written/printed poem_ may be *like* a musical score or in the case of a
visual poem *like* a painting or a drawing and I am coming to the view th=
at
much visual / sound work, much performance work, is *like* not just in
various ways painting and music but writing also - it is a slightly
different kind of thing

i find going to workshops can encourage productive work - knowing that yo=
u
will be with colleagues makes you want to have something to present - mak=
e
*me* want to... not so much open mike but in my case the workshop run in
London by Bob Cobbing where so many of us over here have been - cris chee=
k
referred to it a while back - there's a productive atmosphere there... in=

that context quantity really isnt an issue & in any case one is only
looking at / listening to what is presented that day

                                Above the world-weary horizons

                                New obstacles for exchange arise

                                Or unfold, O ye postmasters!



1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently about 500 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list

should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea=20
is

to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and

also to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible. =20


Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for
further

information. Joel Kuszai is list manager.  For subscription information
contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.=20



____________________________________________________________________


2. Subscriptions


The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or

unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject

line, to:


listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.


*

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system

administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages=20
to

Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your
Poetics

mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new

address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora

(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the
Tools

menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you=20
can

substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.


The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If
your

system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may

get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to
us.

If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase
from

your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription
is

part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider

obtaining a commercial account.


____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot always decode attached or specially formatted
files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.=20


____________________________________________________________________


4. Digest Option


The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to

your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message

each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that

day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no
subject

line) to

                                listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu


set poetics digest


NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply

to this message!!


You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:


set poetics mail

____________________________________________________________________


5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail


Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be
away

for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you
may

lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can
temporarily

turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to "listserv."



set poetics nomail


& turn it on again with: set poetics mail


When you return you can check or download missed postings from the
Poetics

archive. (See 8 below.)


____________________________________________________________________


6. Who's Subscribed


To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the
e-mail message

blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:


  review poetics


You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail)=20
a

rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics

subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.


 or try:


 review POETICS by name

 review POETICS by country


which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country (since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)


*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.*

____________________________________________________________________


7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?


our URL is


http://writing.upenn.edu/epc


The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to

serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity
in

formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The
Center

provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the
new

poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the
POETICS

List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct

connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also
provides information about contemporary print little magazines and SMALL
PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive
collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as

well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.


The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

____________________________________________________________________


8. Poetics Archives via EPC


Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the

links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and

year or search them for specific information. Your interface will

allow you to print or download any of these files.


Or set your browser to go directly to:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive


____________________________________________________________________


9. Publishers & Editors Read This!


PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is
open and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed
publications

as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send
a

list of your press/publications to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the
words EPC Press Listing in the subject line. You may also send materials
on disk. (Write file name, word processing program, and Mac or PC on
disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above to obtain a mailing
address to which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If yourword processor ill
save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly desirable


Send us extended information on new publications (including any back
cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists
(including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to
include full information for ordering--including prices and addresses and
phone numbers both of the press and any distributors.


Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new=20
publications

directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check
the

EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If
you have

a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics
posts.


Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received
a

noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your
publication

and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting
publications.

Poetic Terrorism

Brothers Geoffrey and Aaron Kuffner were arrested in
New Orleans in June and charged with terrorism as the
ones who had recently mailed or hand-delivered suspicious
packages to local government and news media offices.
The packages contained innocuous items (which nonetheless
were frightening enough that two offices called for evacuations)
and a four-page manifesto vowing that "Violent Acts of
Consciousness Have Only Begun." According to police,
the men's goal was to call attention to public ignorance of
poetry and that among their demands was that all state
inaugural speeches be written in iambic pentameter.

Henry--
didn't mean to imply that the sort of continuous flow of poetry that
seems to get produced in more living circumstances is necessarily
memory-less. The thing is, the printing press created the *standardized*
text, the *one* we all know & seems to me that has played a big role in
the *little object over/against time* perception of the poem that has
maybe pushed poems into seeming isolated incidents.

 And (sorry, sorry to of course example this particular history)
Greco-Roman writing did start as a crude score for
articulation--eloquence being considered a high art and writing being a
mean, perfunctory one---(my own theory is that part of development of the
written line is that it had to be brief enough to be written accross an
enslaved Phonecian's theigh, since that was the support being used).

Un-articulatable aspects of writing developed later (with silent reading
especially) & of course became "standard" in the long course of printing.

Have also noticed that many poets who seem oriented toward performance
rather than publication tend (in their writtens) toward a plain
stichometry--but then, what sort of a pause or articulation of any sort
does the stanza really score?

(Or the paragraph break) Who provides examples of clearly scored
poems--Creely, Mallarme, Bidart?

 Maybe true that the willfull rejection of history creates an urgent need
for massive production ? (To which Chris says '"yes, go ahead, one more"
but I'm not driving you home.') Yes, I think, Stevens--on the point being
to refresh our lives. But then, maybe shallow history & reinventing the
wheel might result in more than an experiment in conformity, might be
refreshing, useful? It does open possibilities--who can participate in
speaking and listening & how.  Of course, the limited available history
does not seem such a shackle once you no longer feel penned-in by it,
once there seem to be new kingdoms which include you.

(Apologies if quanity & quality are objectionable in this note)

Somewhere in the epc archives Ron Silliman is forever disdaining the
phrase 'experimental writing'; I've forgotten his argument but not the
point. I myself like the association with labcoats and 'progress' -- what
on earth did Barrett Watten mean? -- but I can see some problems.

What hypothesis does a poem try? How are the results of a poem
reproduceable. Any answer is a Blakean answer -- a poem is the hypthesis
of itself etc the verification of a poem is its readers blah blah, and at
this point the usefulness of the analogy (almost wrote analgesic) to
science is show trial city. One modish and sweet writer (don't you love
blind gossip columns) complained to me after a recent poetry event that
yes it was good to see all these people talking, but couldn't anybody get
past arguing over terms? or even past denying the proposed terms their
existence? I don't think it was a generational complaint either.

So to get past it, or rather to overlap with something else, didn't Henry
say something about language poetry denying history? This struck me as
confusing -- the only totally ahistorical seeming writers are yukyuks like
Clark Coolidge and Jackson Mac Low, and it's only half a jump from their
apparently transcendental miscellanies to a) a groundedness in
contemporary music and b) a vocabulary completely up to date and dare I
say it sometimes even dated. "To deny history" ought to be an indictable
offense, sure, but just try and get it past the grand jury. ( Unless you
mean that Lee Ann and I are denying history by acting like New
York School poets : )

Gwyn McVay sallied forth w/ this salvo --

<< The over-glossing thing can turn a reading into self-parody before
syllable one of the poem has been spoken. . . . .
This was rather more than I wanted to know, and I don't remember the poem
nearly so well as its intro.
o well. Your mileage may vary. >>

yes, & caveat: packing contents may shift with shippage --

these questions of narrative manner / style / succinctness / etc. in the sort of
contextualizing anecdotage that can (sometimes usefully) surround a live-recited
poem *in situ* -- these questions point to some of the pilings [?] on the bridge
between page & performance --

a comparison / compilation of styles of banter / annotation / content (how much
detail? what sort? -- personal, theoretical, philosophical, historical?) / etc. could
be interesting --

of course this also relates to the theoretics of "spontaneous / improvised" versus
"written / pre-planned" utterance --

I know one chap, talking about this in relation to Robert Creeley's wonderfully
urbane, often laconic, fluent & fluid & on occasion a tad florid ways of framing /
intersicing poems at readings -- noted that he felt the whole schtick to be
somewhat rehearsed, faux-on-spur-of-moment -- or some such (semi)-(and
semi-admiring)-grouse --

a recitation preface (McVeyian "gloss") that told me more abt. a poem than I
would have anticipated -- but that I felt enriched for hearing -- came from W.S.
Merwin, reading "Search Party" (which 1st appeared in the journal *Poetry*
and was included in the volume *Travels* -- there's more in the way of
clarifying annotation in the former than in the latter) --

the poem, Merwin-in-the-flesh explained, was written when his dog (Maoli) had
wandered away, and they were searching high & low for it -- and he found that
in such conditions of anxiety, one's language becomes simplified, formalized
(here I'm paraphrasing) . . .

he was sent back, it seems, to a ballade of Villon's (after which "Search Party" is
clearly based) --

he remarked that such French as he had learned, he first approached mainly so as
to be able to read Villon in the original --

that he was not (usually) influenced by Villon in the sense of trying to write like
Villon -- that if he could do so, perhaps that would've been all that he would
have done --

but that "influence" works in different ways than is sometimes supposed:

he allowed that there had been a recurrent dream, in which he was up in the attic
of his childhood home (where one certainly does not go), was searching through
the trunk that one in no wise opens, and then it found it to be full of his own
poems -- but that these were (in fact) Villon's . . .

hearing of this dream (and learning of Merwin's regard for Villon) served to
informe interestingly abt. what Merwin is / has been up to . . .

so there's one instance

        What Finnegan has to say puts me in mind of Proust's call to work
from the particular to the general, hence transforming data into
knowledge, which is not so easily shared but truly much more valuable, and
it should be expected of any poet, prolific or not, that they produce work
which is of a sort that can convey knowledge efficiently.  This is perhaps
at the roots of the obsession with form over and sometimes above the
essential question,"What am I going to write about?"  For to adequately
call up before the eyes of a reader, an average reader, anything unlike
Proust's dictum in reverse seems more and more like an impossibility in
contemporary poetry.  With quite remarkable exceptions (Tan Lin?) the
langpo I
venture through seems only to transcend the academic doodle effect when it
dogmatizes, or worse, flaunts and vaunts the none too especial conceits of
the author.

Howdy.
Does anybody else suspect that the List may have exploded while you were
offline? An occasional message tells me this isn't so. Actually, the low
volume of messages is welcome right now. When it picks up again, perhaps a
whole new tone will permeate it.

This post is just to say that with a recent upgrade of computers and
software here at work I've been able to download and play the soundfiles at
EPC. Right now I'm listening to Susan Howe read her poems. With headphones
the bosses don't suspect a thing!

What a great resource-- when are some more poets going to be available?

Hi, from the pondside, was struck by this,

> -- the only totally ahistorical seeming writers are yukyuks like
>Clark Coolidge and Jackson Mac Low, and it's only half a jump from their
>apparently transcendental miscellanies to

want to elaborate Jordan? Perhaps yukyuks mean groovy, like bad becoming
wicked = good. I donno, doubt that. Perhaps it's just expressing revulsion
at the aging body? So in what ways Jordan are MacLows and Coolidge's
writings ahistorical? Or even transcendental? I be intrigued to know how
you argue that.

This strikes me as a defining attitude. When a couple of younger poets here
in London were rigging up to read in New York City, they were asked who
they might like to be co-billed with. (Both are writers with a high regard
for Coolidge btw and in particular of 'The So', 'Ing', 'Suite V', 'The
Maintains'  -  says something interesting about some vice-versa
differences). They put forward Ted Greenwald as a suggestion and met a
response of the 'you can't be serious' variety. These younger Brits read
new work from counterparts in the US and tell me they are struck by its
sentimentality, its lack of incision (I'm hugely paraphrasing here). They
are finding the early lang-po (generally before 1980-ish) the most
energising and generative models to read and learn from.

Curious differences. Part of which in the pre-'e' days might be explained
by the UK's cultural passivity in respect of the US dominance and by a time
lag of approximately 5 years. But the tide is less defined these days.

Curious about what seems from here, to be a need to dump the 'elders' and
not to learn from them ups and outs and their mistakes in a more positive
frame.

love and love

Hi Lawrence,

I lost my dictionary while cleaning the stable but I think that "yukyuk" must
be an effort to twist the now nearly obsolete usage of "yuk" as verb/noun into
a jordanesque noun.  One used to "yuk it up"--i.e. have a chortle or two.  That
word it rhymes with suggests a buried origin in carnal hilarity.  Kids, of
course, still say "Yuk!" but only to allude to the brilliant animated TV
series, later a book series, written by Anne van der Essen and illustrated by
Etienne Delessert.  Product of Swiss TV, the books themselves published in
English-language editions by Moonlight Publishing in Britain though printed in
Italy, they were called as I recall _Yok-Yok_.  Ah, cosmopolitan youth, where
are you off to now?  Jordan will know, as he is only 15.

>and while you're doing that, just off at a tangent, do you guys use the
>word _airhead_ at all?
>
"Airhead" is still heard now and again though seems fading with, say, "air
guitar."  Just about anything will get stuck in front of "head" these days,
i. e. "cheesehead," "blubberhead," "inoppugnablehead," etc.  However, even
with Beavis and Butthead winding down, "shithead" still "rules."

Hope this helps.

all best,
Keith

A brief report from the John Taggart reading in Chicago-- JT
packed in a crowd, some 40 faces in a tiny space.    Those
included Joe Amato, Bob Harrison down from Milwaukee,  Mr.
David Grubbs of Gastr del Sol, and los bros Peter and Michael O'leary,
editors of LVNG.  JTaggart delivered a flawless, smooth-as-silk
peformance, his savvy with a mic prooving a deep interest in
the texture of enunciation.  JT's sonicity  (a word I'll invent to signify
the amount of attention given to the effect of the spoken poem in
a performance space/environment or "reading") would be two degrees
less than Anne Waldman and one degree less than Susan Howe.  But
this was not talking poetry-- one almost expected to see JT tapping
his finger in/for time while reading, a trick someone once told me
Robert Duncan used to do.

I failed to take notes, but I do know that all JT read is from the
forthcoming Sun and Moon collection called Crosses.

Later JT was kind enough to give me a poem which I'll type in here.

I thought it was a worthy enough question.  In fact, I posted a

I'm wondering too abt. yukyuk, and no doubt JD will enlighten the
masses of usses -- but meanwhile, here's a hypothesis abt. (tentative
parsing of) the repeatable enigma (i.e., yukyuk) --

1. somewhat reminds of muck-a-muck (derived from "high muck-a-muck")
with indeed poss. American Indian roots -- acc. to WWWebster's:

  Main Entry: high-muck-a-muck
  Pronunciation: "hI-'m&-ki-"m&k
  Variant(s): or high-muck=B7e=B7ty-muck /"hI-'m&-k&-tE-"m&k/
  Function: noun
  Etymology: by folk etymology from Chinook Jargon hayo makamak plenty
  to eat Date: 1856 : an important and often arrogant person

[also note:
   Main Entry: muck-a-muck
   Variant(s): or muck=B7ety-muck /'m&-k&-tE-/
   Function: noun
   Date: 1912
   : HIGH-MUCK-A-MUCK  ]

2. the word yuk (or yuck) itself has three distinct meanings (only 2
of 'em covvered by WWWebst.) --

The WWWebster 2nd entry says:

  Main Entry: 2yuck
  Variant(s): also yuk
  Function: interjection
  Date: 1966
  -- used to express rejection or disgust <spending hours over some
  dish and getting, "yuck, I hate that" -- Anne Dowie>

this is presumably the lexical sense that can make LUpton wonder if
yukyuk should be understood to suggest some manner of derogation
("term of abuse").   WWWebster's does give another meaning of yuck:

  Main Entry: 1yuck
  Pronunciation: 'y&k
  variant of<SUP>2yak    -->

  Main Entry: 2sup
  Function: noun
  Date: circa 1570
  : a mouthful especially of liquor or broth : SIP; also : a small
  quantity of liquid <pour me just a sup of tea>

but it's hard for me to find the relevance.  That webtionary doesn't
seem to know about what I think of as the more likely relevant usage
-- what I'm considering the 3rd (most colloquial?) sense of yuck --

as based on the expression "yuck yuck yuck" (or some such), meaning
"heh heh"or "what a joke!" or "ho ho ho!" . . . i.e., a (perhaps
cartoon-based) interjection signifying or suggesting laughter (or
oftentimes, the idea of laughter shorn of the actual phenomenon?) --

anyway, in my speculative opinion, "a yukyuk" suggests someone
who's a serious comic of some sort -- a jokester / trickster

involved in outlandish feats of metaphysical humor or "cosmic
laughter" as 'twere --

a yukyuk =3D a muck-a-muck of chuckle-down-theory, belike? --

3.  In general, btw, the UCK words may have a degree of
intertextuality (so to say, sotto voce) -- i.e., any one UCK word
suggests another in various degrees of subtextual resonance --

muck / yuck / fuck / schmuck /
luck / pluck / cluck / duck /
Huck [Finn] /
Puck [Djinn] /
tuck in
  [also, as in Tuck & Patti] /
puk win
  [sp? as in hockey] /
chuck
  [also, as in to chuck up] /
truck
  [also, as in, "don't have much truck with"] /

and there's:
 snuck up (trickster)
 stuck up (dickster)
 chuck up (yuckster)
 fuck up (schmuckster)

 gotchyer pluck up?
 dontcha muck up!
 whatta schmuck!

<<I thought it was a worthy enough question.>> says d.i.

ok - and the responses to me have made me see that the word _yukyuk_ is
more complex if only slightly than i thought when i responded - but reall=
y
it wasn't the word itself that was my main concern but those to whom it w=
as
being applied and the general attitude it clearly expresses

it was the manner of my response that i just about regretted - i had neve=
r
heard _yukyuk_ before but it will always make me think of jordan davis
now... whether or not i should also think  _schmuck_ is another matter

if i have been taken more seriously than i intended regarding the pose of=

my response then that's my responsibility

i *was* serious about my opposition to the dismissiveness i detect in the=

reference to coolidge and mac low, dismissiveness without any foundation
being apparent

i thought cris's response was more constructive - and points to one aspec=
t
of how a strong reply came from this side of the ocean

i'd like an explanation and defence or retraction of what he said from
jordan davis

I've always understood "yukyuk" to be related
to "mucketymuck" or "yuckety-yuk."

Silly words for bigwigs, not derisive,
not really negative --only slightly under-the-breath

or with a cocked eye. Coolidge is a bigwig,
no? And in history if not totally with it.

I have always read _Crystal Text_ as a quasi-transcendental,
thwarted visionary, interior lyric in the matrice of

yukyuks like Blake or Beckett. The early "particle language"
work is beautifully romantic too. Well.

Bennett --

quite right, you've expressed more nail-on-the-head what I was trying
to get (at in scattershot manner) abt. the evident sense / nuances of
yukyuk (though rather speculative / intuitive on my part, since I
think I'd not encountered the term used in this exact manner) --

a bit, then, like saying, "such a doubhty & estimable scriviner as
Henry James has allowed . . . " except that Jordon phrases it in
a jaunty late-20th cent. manner (rather than a jaunty late 19th cent.
manner) . . .

but the Jordanian barrister will no doubt return anon w/ it's stellar
expert opinion . . . till then,

cheerio old sport, &c.

Keith Tuma says that the use of "airhead" is fading but I found it bubbling
into my consciousness over and over again watching Naomi Campbell parade up
and down the aisle of the church during the Versace funeral.  But my
reaction is probably influenced by a) being the only member of the poetics
list to have read Naomi Campbell's novel, "Swan," and then b) seeing her
interviewed by Larry King in which she admitted that she had never read
"Swan," but on the other hand someone had told her the plot and it all
sounded marvelous.

hi again kevin (after forever!).  Do you mean that someone wrote the novel
and that her name is on it as author, or she's a character, or what?

The printing press sure had an effect on how writing was conceived /
erceived / approached, etc., though probably not an easily
simplifiable effect.  Word processing (with the ease of revision) has
an effect, no doubt, too.

I'm reminded of how Walt Whitman's successive editions contributed to
his framework of development / polishing / perfecting (in his view)
of his work.

The published book is, in its way, a figure for the "act of
publication" that is involved in speech itself --

when you speak, lo! & presto! -- there's what you've said!, hovering
in air, indellible in historical fact though the ears that have heard
it may already begin to tinker with it, memory-wise, as the half-life
sets in (or as the noise of traffic drowns out a phrase) . . .

btw, what poetry is produced in "less living circumstances" one
wonders? -- are the dead writing & publishing, these days?

cheers,

        Re the work of Clark Coolidge and Jackson Mac Low being
"ahistorical" and "transcendental miscellenies"--
        not sure where this idea came from! perhaps a kind of trickle
down from some of Jameson's asssertions re "postmodern pastiche" and
"free floating signifiers" etc used as elements in collage?
with words and images detached from their contexts? some other
theoretical generalities?
        Rather than get embroiled in wondering about this, let alone
which version of the transcendental is being referred to--(Emerson's? the
Maharishi's? )--
        Mac Low is one of the most historically conscious and aware
artists/performers/writers/scholars/musicians this writer/reader has
encountered. His work makes use of this awareness and knowledge through a
wide variety of methods, texturings, palimpsests, juxtapostions,
appostions and references.  The notes alone appended to many Mac Low
pieces (which i have actually heard people complain of) are thorough and
have been a good part of my education--following up Mac Low's references
and having opened up wide areas of literary history previously unknown to
myself and as well reading a great many historical texts that the works
refer to and work with.  Because he works in/with many fields of activity
and materials, Mac Low's work opens these up to the
reader/viewer--bringing in histories of dance, performance, sound poetry,
visual poetry, classical literature and history and as well opening up
American history. There is also
Mac Low's commitment to activism in relation to the events of recent
American history.
        Mac Low for myself has been as Duncan said of Olson "a
mighty fire source" and I deeply appreciate the ongoing enquiries and
studies he has presented for myself and others.  And i don't mean in terms
of inspiration alone by his example--but historical knowledge and
questioning.
        Clark Coolidge--in many ways an historical writer as well.  His
knowledge and use of American literature and jazz for example, as well
the histories involved with these--see for example the letters between him
and Paul Metcalf published in the STATIONS Clark Coolidge Symposium--
as well as interviews and essays re Kerouac, jazz drumming--the work
of Art Blaeky for example--quite an historical knowledge there which is made
use of in the work--
        something to think of reading Coolidge in re history is TIME--as he's
a jazz and rock drummer, "keeping time" to be sure important! "a sense of
measure" so to speak--and another time & measure Coolidge works with is
that of geology--see for example the extraordinary SMITHSONIAN
DEPOSITIONS--playing on the Smithsonian museum, deposits as of minerals
(after all he also wrote QUARTZ HEARTS, the CRYSTAL TEXT etc) and
depositions as evidence--and the Earth Works artist/essayist Robert
Smithson--the book makes a kind of multivoiced autobiographical narrative
by using texts from WCW (Smithson's family's doctor; the use of sediment
chart in Paterson inspired Smithson & Smithson wanted his essay "A Tour
of the Monuments of the Passaic" to be thought of as a kind of appendix
to Paterson)--Smithson, Kerouac, writings and interviews by/with Chabrol
and Godard (film makers much influenced by Amrican writers and
filmmakers) geology texts, the Professor Challenger stories of
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle--presenting several
layerings/appostions/interweavings of times--human, geological,literay and
film--fiction and fact--as all the sources are listed at the back of the
book, as in several of Coolidge's other works--the indication is that the
work is taking place within a context/vortex of consciously chosen historical
conjunctions.
        The work of Mac Low and Coolidge rather than being ahistorical is
archeological--or, to use my own term, anarcheological--that is, it works
with elements of history and time and opens them by arrangements which
make new configurations, dances, musics and questions--they indicate a
participatory use of historical materials rather than a detaching of them
from historical memory.  Rather than transcending these elements, the
works make them present in new arrangements--which suggests that the
materials of history are to be continually examined, mined, questioned,
made use of and participated in and with and for.
        So my thanks to Mac Low and Coolidge--they've kept me busy for
quite some time now digging away in the anarcheological environs of
history--and I mean real time, not transcendental time, too--like years
in record stores book stores libraries conversations performances
following up their leads . . . and applying them & making use of them--
        i.e. practice

DBC --

thanks for the argument abt. the historical & MacLow / Coolidge --
well said, & interestingly informed --

so, if "ahistorical" doesn't make the grade (re: these writers), how
about "pan-historical" ?

btw, the discussion of archaeology reminds of Meredith Monk's
marvelous "American Archeology #1" performance that happened on
Roosevelt Island several summers ago (re: which, btw, I penned a
review for The New Art Examiner) -- MM hoped to have this as first in
a possible series of "digs" into particular histories of American
sites (this one dealt w/ the strange history of that little island,
as well as MM's usual pallette of broad post-Jungian concerns) --
I hope she's able to get back to it & proceed further  . . .

cheers,

Historical is such a precise and narrow qualification that it may not do
anyone any good. Poof. Actually, I find it difficult to speak of Coolidge
(I'm not as comfortable with Mac Low) in terms of "history" because he so
consciously invokes measures of time; they are a crux, but a "history"?
Maybe for termites. Terminal index. Tight? THe time of a reading, the time
of a tongue, syllab-le, time of a debris sliding over a thing timed as a
book to explode. I like the suggestion to call Coolidge archeological
instead of historical. I tried to make the claim in a paper that Coolidge
is allegorical as well, where physical word matters come to stand, are
experienced, sprawl out (is this what "the lean" means?) as a provisional
and personally felt truth of language. I don't feel too awkward speaking
about "truths of language" in reference to Coolidge because his writing
does bring them on, coddles them. Like Smithson's "Sedimentation of the
Mind" or "A Heap of Language" or his hypothetical maps of a textual
lost-continent of "Atlantis," many Coolidge works compell me to think in
terms of elsewheres and hiding places, be they folds of geolithic time,
graphic discombobulation, or the phenomena of a life begged in writing
(cf. _The Crystal Text_). Of course, both Smithson and Coolidge --and
Gordon Matta-Clark is another great example-- are at pains to point to
where the elses are. The liminal, which may be a purely formal space, is
very much right here and now, guised (but _is_ it "guised") in words,
rocks, apartment blocks, Passaic, NJ. The rub is to see it, vision being
so incredibly taken for granted. Thus Smithson's non-sites, Coolidge's
poem gravel, and Matta-Clark's sawed-open "anarchitecture" come off like
science-fiction --out of this time, some time, which time, extravagant and
counter-intuitive.

Does anyone consider Coolidge a didactic poet (this isn't a negative
qualification)? Would such a consideration require more fundamenntal
quandries like "belief" (Do I believe what you're proposing Clark
Coolidge? Do I believe in Smithson's chtonic urge? Do I believe
Matta-Clark or Dan Graham's grasp of "ideological" critique is
supportable? OUCH!), or "success" (do such efforts to make clear or dark
work, are they making me experience "X" "correctly" or are they making
me "experience" X period? What X (did I cover that one?), or, fuck it,
"intention" (Do I understand exactly why "the mud of the bulk of the back
yard" begins _Quartz Hearts_ or what such a phrase could do?
                         (DO? DO PHRASES DO?))

And yes, "history" --stuff that has happened-- greatly influences CC's
poetry. Jazz soforth. But this doesn't make him a "historical" poet in the
way such a term is usually inferred (as in Pound maybe, or even Williams
tho he's closer).

From that point on, dissolution, annihilation.

The editors of the William Blake Archive -- Morris Eaves, Robert Essick,
and Joseph Viscomi -- are pleased to announce that The Book of Thel,
copy F, is now online in searchable form. This may seem a modest
achievement, given that this is one of Blake's shorter works, and that
its eight plates (with enlargements and accompanying transcriptions)
have already been available on the site since November of 1996. In
fact, however, this copy of The Book of Thel is a prototype for all
future works to be added to the Archive (both illuminated books and
other materials), and its appearance reflects the architecture and
objectives of the Archive as they have taken shape over many months of
development, testing, and refinement.

Unlike its previous version, and unlike the other illuminated books
currently available in the Archive, this copy of Thel has been tagged
using SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). SGML tagging offers
the Archive's users the opportunity to perform sophisticated searches,
either on the text of the plates, or, more remarkably, on the content of
their illustrations. Search results are retrieved and presented using
DynaWeb, a product of the Inso Corporation. The text and image searching
enabled by DynaWeb and the underlying SGML tagging is a powerful
demonstration of the potential of electronic resources in the
humanities.

However, there's more. Users with Java-capable browsers can now make use
of Inote, Java-based software developed at the Institute for Advanced
Technology in the Humanities, to assist them in their study of the
Archive's visual materials. Users may employ Inote to examine editorial
annotations of a given image independently of a search, or else,
following a successful image search, Inote may be used to open the
image, zoomed to the specific area containing the object of the search,
together with the relevant editorial commentary. This is IATH's first
public implementation of Inote, and its release marks a major advance
for image-based electronic editing.

Users with Java-capable browsers can also take advantage of a second,
equally innovative Java program developed at IATH, the ImageSizer. This
is a feature that allows one to view Blake's plates and images at their
true size, reproducing the object's actual physical dimensions on the
screen, regardless of the resolution of a particular monitor; indeed,
users can calibrate this feature to consistently display the Archive's
images at whatever proportions they may wish.

Finally, the Archive's selective bibliography of criticism, reference
materials, and standard editions, with about 500 entries, is now
available. We hope to have the bibliography searchable by the end of the
summer. We also hope to have David V. Erdman's Complete Poetry and Prose
of William Blake online and searchable by that same time.

In the coming weeks and months we will turn our attention to placing
other illuminated books online in searchable form, following on the
model of The Book of Thel, copy F.  We will begin with the other copies
of Thel (copies H and O), as well as copies of Visions of the Daughters
of Albion (copies C and J) now publicly available only in HTML -- thus
lacking any of the capabilities described above. We will then move on to
other books: All Religions are One (copy A), There is No Natural
Religion (copies C and L), The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (copy D),
America (copy E), Europe (copies B and E), The Song of Los (copies A and
B), The Book of Urizen (copy G), Songs of Innocence and of Experience
(copy Z), The Book of Ahania (copy A), and The Book of Los (copy A).

Yes, David -- I was thinking of the reemergence of Don Rickles, and the
curious embrace he's found himself locked in, tickled, is there hope for
Ted Greenwald? Worked with Ted, actually, and am pleased to hear young
englische seek him out -- must be Miles C, huh? Sure couldn't be Keston...
as for the droll allegation that younger americans gone soft, let me
remind Snr Upton of the etymology of Frankie Goes To Hollywood -- the
group believed that "Hollywood" was a place, and that the headline
"Frankie Goes Hollywood" was a sorry american error -- in fact "Hollywood"
is a sort of quantum space/time construction, meaning, an adjective .. so
that a proper substitution would not be "Wichitia" or "Brummagem" but
"sour" or "wrong". Anyway, relax, don't do it -- J

Slams at the national level are crazy cool. However, Wesleyan is
not the sponsoring org. Most of the events will be held in bookshops,
bars & coffeeshops in Middletown CT, with only a couple of events
being held on the Wesleyan campus. The Buttonwood Tree, a very
independent & freewheeling arts center, will be the hub of the whole
affair.

At the national level Slam is organized by a loose confederation of
the slam masters. A slam master is a self-appointed role--anyone
who initiates a slam on a regular basis is a slam master. The most
active slam masters hail from Boston, Chicago, SF, Portland, Austin
Asheville, NYC, and Connecticut. In this '97 Nationals 36 (4-person)
teams will compete, from cities & regions all over the US & Canada.
This year there will even be a team called Mouth Almighty, which
I believe is sponsored by the spoken word recording outfit of the same
name (instigator Bob Holman, of the United States of Poetry project).
Also, there are individual competitors registered--Lisa Buscani and
D.J. Renegage are among the names I recognize.

Faith Vicinanza is the slam master and force behind slamming in Conn--
she and a small cadre of fervent slammers first petitioned to get the slam
to Conn., and then planned/produced the whole show. And it is showtime,
especially by the semi-final rounds when the stops get pulled out.

Perhaps it's too much of a local news item for the poetics list, but
Buffalo poet, english professor, and longtime conspiratorial angel, Mac
Hammond passed away last week in Buffalo.

If there is anyone out there who knew Mac, or his poetry, please get in
touch with me before too long.

Published by Ohio U.P., Alan Swallow, Hammond was a student and friend of
Jakobson and Pomorska before taking his PhD from Harvard in the early 60s.

I remain flabbergasted that Upton takes so much offense on behalf of Mac
Low and Coolidge -- when as has been explained none was meant, and none
was heard _within the community_. Lawrence, I do think you're being rude.

I'm also puzzled that Henry will not speak to the issue of language poetry
and history he raised -- especially when so many have taken up the issue
with him. I will stick to my distinction between work which explicitly
uses historical data (the Olson line) and work which while it is in fact
(surprise surprise!)  located in time (dated -- god this is exhausting)
does not in fact refer to the events of what I am imagining to be for
Henry a Mandelstamian conscience (the idea that we must be classicists
because there were totalitarians afoot the same time the modernists were
working). I will call your attention once more in what I hope you are
hearing as John Cleese's voice to the fact that I was arguing bitterly
with Henry about precisely this issue, this sad, bizarre, misbegotten,
lonely, kudzu-covered idea, that a work can lack historicity --
specifically the work of language poets.  Since I haven't read a single
word from a bona fide language poet here on the topic, I'm going to assume
that at most this thread has merely enregistered another four or five
names on the list of names the language poets keep -- I had to torture
Bruce Andrews with Mantovanni records for two days to get the FACT of the
existence of this list verified -- the list of names language poets keep
of poets who are BENEATH contempt and who should be met with nothing more
civil than a raised eyebrow. It's time we all just acknowledged the list
(cough).

As for the larger community of younger british poets, and wouldn't that be
a better thread, would you care to mention some? I may have only dropped
the names of two -- because (ignoring all evidence in this thread to the
contrary)  I would rather carry on a discussion that involved names,
works, words and ideas, rather than blah blah blah lack of incision blah
blah sentimental blah have you actually read Ted?

My contribution to the post you mention, incidentally, ends well before
the snipped bit of David Israel's post.

Goodbye, and good luck,
Jordan

Maybe I missed something here. Unlike Upton, I speak American. Referring to
people as "yukyuks" is certainly an idiosyncratic usage, but also clearly
dismissively pejorative. Jordan, you're surely entitled to feel any way you
wish about MacLow and Coolidge, and whether or not there is an official
raised-eyebrow list among language poets (there used to be something pretty
close among some of Olson's epigones) we probably each have private lists of
those whose work we dismiss. But if I feel dismissive of x or y I think it
behooves me in this forum to express my reasons--it's that kind of forum.
Otherwise we'll all drown in expletives.

        I'm puzzled by the recent exchanges involving rudeness, yukyuks
and so on between Jordan Davis and Lawrence Upton.  Maybe it's just my
impression, but Jordan Davis doesn't seem to have answered any questions
raised for him--and politiely one might add--re his idea of yukyuk,
the transcendental and so on--seems it has been left up to others to do
the work of sending in ideas re the word as well as re the work of Mac
Low and Coolidge, the historical, ahistorical and panhistorical,
anarcheological, mining and MM---(my thanks and appreciation to David
Israel and Bennet Simpson for their informative and thought provoking
posts!) while Jordan Davis has replied only with cute quips re
FrankieG(T)H and
accusations directed at Lawrence Upton. Going back through the posts, the
tone and number of apologies seems to be steadily increasing from
Lawrence Upton. I don't see any reason for this until coming across in a
Jordan Davis post the words re no offence being meant and "none was
heard_within the community_" which is rather baffling.  Which community?
Are the people who wrote on the list who raised questions and exchanged
ideas without the particiaption of Jordan Davis part of this  community
or  not and so on.    The mention of a nameless commnity who sees things
Jordan Davis' way --well, methinks it comes across as a tactic of
intimidation to some extent--and seems to have worked as I note Lawrence
Upton apologizing while Jordan Davis asserts his flabbergasted state.
        Discussion with definitions and disagreements--exchange of ideas
and materials--with many possibilities of use--yes.  Some rudeness when
impassioned--sure.  When Tom Mandel talked about raising his
fists--well, he meant his own and gave his own reasons. But I don't
particularly get a good feeling when one
person is being steadily backed into apologizing as the other protests
astonishment while also invoking a like minded unnamed community behind them
someplace.

        So, back to some discussion--Jordan Davis noted differing attitudes among
Watten and Silliman in re the term "experimental".
        Here is Clark Coolidge on the term:
        (Lee Bartlett has just asked CC "Do you think of yourself as an
'experimental writer'?")
        Not really.  I understand that category in a general sense, but
"experimental" always sounds like you are trying to do something rather
than doing it.  But if the term does mean what it could mean--pushing
things beyond various limits--great!

Great news about what is certainly a very important new book on Bunting,
a wonderful poet and not nearly as well known as he should be on this
side of the Atlantic.

The title, _A Northern Life_, indicates the book stays pretty focussed
on one aspect of what I understand to be a fascinating and various life
-- does anyone know if a full-scale biography is in the works anywhere?

As I said in the cavalier post that made 'em angry in England -- I
wondered what Henry could mean by the proposition that language poetry
denied history. Then I took two writers somewhere on the outskirts of Lang
City -- two writers whose work it's generally (and with some reason)  safe
to say are _worth looking into_ -- and -- as a contrarian mind you!  --
alleged that their work in fact did not explicitly refer to historical
events as say the work of SUSAN HOWE does, or even explicitly refer to
literary-historical events as say the work of CHARLES BERNSTEIN or BRUCE
ANDREWS does. It was a very harmful claim, to be sure, and I hope the
offended will send me their laundry bills. As for the flagrant use of a
completely irrelevant characterization -- yukyuk -- I noticed that just as
in Merican politics, in Merican poetics, it gets all the attention the
argument at hand is too shy to demand. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the era of the wrong word. I did receive a kind postcard from Jackson once
asking me to be more clear about his having preceded language poetry, and
the language poetry reading of Clark Coolidge may turn out to be one of
the kinder moments in the history of manifest destiny, so if you can
extend your definitions of mea culpa around those clauses, I believe we
can both end up satisified. Henry -- are you smiling through all this?
Would you please answer my question? Bennett's given some useful notes on
history...  Jordan

DBC correctly points out that I'm holding a teddy bear in the picture of
me saying 'my friends still like me' -- the bear does it, I mean -- as for
the allegation that I am dodging this issue of relative historicity, I
think a mysterious delay in the listserv's delivery is to blame -- the
'pacock' post (and the later unpleasant 'rude' one -- ugh, how awful to
have melted down -- Lawrence, if you ever come to New York, look me up, I
know excellent places to have lunch -- I promise not to equate everyone
from the UK with FGtH if you promise not to mention the shortcomings of
the group of writers I've been struggling to be associated with) has about
all that I can think to say about this. At any rate -- sorry to everyone,
my motto is "I orient to the virtual offense" and I seem to have
presumed that the general befuddlement around a throwaway word
excused me -- once again, Jackson, if there's mud (or mod) on you
from this -- I'll have it steamed out -- presumed that the
befuddlement entitled me to employ y'all as a big shield -- I'll not do
that again.

I wasn't being coy when I suggested the possibility of discussing
ultrarecent writers from places other than the continental US -- I'm
particularly fond of Keston (Sutherland)'s poem "Vac Stucco" and could
type in some bits if anyone felt a blip of interest -- and in the
tradition of international logrolling I will mention that Keston did
publish a book of mine --

Mark Weiss -- it may have been that kind of subtlety more imaginary than
expressed, but I meant something more affectionate than dismissal by the
term 'yukyuk' -- but as Anselm Berrigan says, Heidegger is as manipulative
as Spielberg --

there's a line of Joseph Lease's I've always liked -- "humorless
trickster" --

Seems to me again that considering the dispersed possibilities for reading
poetry, it's still a pretty conservative (and choppy comprehending) set of
skills we bring to mail we can scroll through -- I've thought before that
those slips can bring about beautiful misunderstandings -- though I feel
today like a hideous pedant --

and one mo time, sorry --

Hey Jordan, hey list, hey hey hey.  Jordan, I know my rendition of List
participation might remind many of a horse with internet goggles mumbling
into his feedbag - BUT the truth is, this time, I've just been away for a
few days. Now to respond erratically to your query - & also briefly I hope -

remaining as always beneath the contempt radar -

I always talk about "language poetry", as many of you know full well, from
a perspective of SEVERAL levels of abstraction.  Oh ey fer sure.  That is,
I aim for the theoretical shield, not the honorable practitioners, whose work
I make no claim to be much familiar with.  Some of you will want to drop me
right there (others maybe at the corner?).

Maybe when I talk about language poetry I'ma just talking about my "idea" of
same.  Here's muh idea:  did I say it was anti- or un-historical? I'm not sure.
I think I said that what came across to me as its THEORY was that referential
discourse & poetry as conventional echo-effect needs to be imploded, for
cultural-revolutionary purposes.  Now at various times & places the lang.po
political argument is made, at others the aesthetic (the political I just gave;
the aesthetic is that the autonomy of lang.po experiment & freedom is
all the politics it needs).  My own argument all along has been that by
giving up referentiality (NOT that they DO that all the time) as in
post-structuralism, and dismantling rather than organizing a structure
of meaning, said lang.po (MY version of it) offers a sort of truncated
or emptied-out THEORY of poetry. The phrase "language poetry" looks in 2
directions - outward toward a presumed special definition of language,
and inward as a sort of self-reflexive or recursive phrase (i.e. all
poetry is in language. it's sort of redundant). In both directions it
reminds me of symbolism, which also trashed ordinary discourse & aimed
to purify the words of the tribe.  Poetry is a VERY VERY SLIPPERY
THING, Jordan!  In the Long March Through the Little Magazines and the
Big Institutions we grow rightfully wary of ACCOMODATION TO OCCASIONS &
SENTIMENT OF MASSES & ELITES ALIKE!!  Makes it tough to squeeze out those
Mint Crest Toothpaste Odes after every meal.

Anyway, I agree that this is all pretty old hat, gang - I agree with
the people who write to this list about SPECIFIC things they've read.
Not to have anymore ignorant clashes by night.  - Henry G.

I agree with you, Rachel - it was I who really got off the track of your
topic.  Seems like the quantity/quality issue comes up whether you look
at performance end or script end of the spectrum.  I liked "Finnegan's"
comment about the contract with the reader in any case.  But, as you
imply, the temptation toward graphomania is always there.

A poem's not exactly like a musical score.  It's just an analogy.  The
written poem provides the OPPORTUNITY for varied approaches (as does the
score).  But I would say stanza breaks, any kind of lineation etc., can
be mined for performance results.  A stanza seems like a pretty clear
indicator of overall speed & pacing - ESPECIALLY when the pattern is
broken & the syntax begins to flow over the breaks.

Absolutely.  The stodgy traditionalist I too-often sound like is no friend
of poetry.  I just wonder sometimes about the emphasis in the US especially
on PRODUCTION - workshops, writing programs, readings, slams.  The glut
factor.  Can - does - anybody actually read anything anymore?  It may be
that an idea of poetry as occupying a tightrope between script and
performance - and without those 2 poles, the rope (or the bowstring)
falls slack - would help...

or it might just add another layer of "technique"...

maybe it all comes down to non-technical factors - the artist - the writer
maybe especially - as TALKING TO the "culture" at large - communicating
a message or messages...  but then, talk gets cheaper & cheaper it seems...
that's a related issue...a poem should be a solid complex crystal to a
factor of -1,000... Yeats used barbells for exercise & said all poetry
should be made to be recited...
... I'm going to shut up now...    Henry G....

There is another odd association for me - having worked in Nova Scotia a
great deal (mostly Cape Breton recently), the accents, Scottish music, and
then medieval Scottish itself with what seems to me a broad -a-. So I hear
a lilt; I tried to return recently to reading Burns, with little success
however (although I like Henryson for example).

Jordan - I am referring to your message backchannel. I dont think that it=

is appropriate to cbackchannel those kind of remarks when the disagreemen=
t
starts in public and it does seem to me intimidating in intent to send it=

backchannel

I dont think I have been shabby
I havent called you a schmuck.
I haven't called you a lunatic...
I said is that I am well acquainted with being told I am the only one who=

holds an opinion.
It doesnt work with me though it does upset me when used aggressively.

I may well be ignorant, you may well be right.
I make no attempt to cover my ignorance.
If I am not ignorant in this matter then there are a thousand things I am=

ignorant of and I suspect you are the same because everyone else is.
People who try to cover their ignorance don't learn. I want to learn. Tha=
t
is why I am on the list.
I dont think I am ignorant of the context of your remarks. I don't think
you have explained to any degree.
But perhaps that is my ignorance and I have lost interest now... I regret=

that you have not.
I cannot follow exactly what you are saying towards the end of the first
two quoted paragraphs - my ignorance again - but besmirched is not a word=
 I
have used and I have said nothing about Susan Howe.
You say you are embarrassed about apologising to me. I am not embarrassed=

about apologising to you.
I think it was right to do it for itself now... =


Jordan, I don't know you and the way things have gone I guess I am unlike=
ly
to - i suppose the lunch invite is off. I can be jokey and am sometimes
misunderstood for that because the tone cant be heard in writing
so I am trying generally to be far more serious than I feel in my posting=
s,
even at my lowest I have a kind of underlying jollity whatever is going o=
n =

But that is different to the facetiousness I find in what little I have
seen of your postings - I think it is aggressive rather than assertive an=
d
there seems little charity or friendliness. It takes my jollity away
anyway.

I am very sorry to have offended you, genuinely, but I suspect others wil=
l
do it to you as well if this is how you usually behave. However, schmuck
and lunatic have not been applied to you yet and it is unhelpful and
upsetting for you to claim they have been.

as much as I value your presence on the
list, & I mean both of you, do you think
that in the future this exchange could be
handled backchannel? I guess maybe this
is a general request to listmembers as well.
it's just that I find it upsetting & needless
to watch folks argue so bitterly over such
things. I appreciate that there's little enough
to be done now, & matters seem to be past
the point of reconciliation, & I'm surely not
interested in perpetuating the situation by
taking sides. I also understand that this sort
of thing is likely to happen anytime there are
more than 2 people in a room for more than
10 minutes=97but really, can we try to keep
it down when it does happen? banter,
even bickering is one thing (well, they're 2
different things but each one is...), but
this is the kind of thing I expect to see
on Divorce Court (& if I didn't watch it

Lawrence --

Why would lunch be off?

If you can stand the company of a facetious quipper, I can accept (for the
duration of a meal, anyway) the possibility that there might be something
to talk about. It's also possible that you're right, we'd have very little
to say. We've had next to nothing to say here.

A phrase I've heard a lot at my parents' house lately: "street theater."

I will add that, excluding this row, I've enjoyed your posts to the list.

Okay, everybody finished apologizing now?

I can wait a LITTLE longer . . .

Okay. Can I go back to what I thought Jordan's original subject was,
namely "history," and its capability of being reflected (or not) in verse?

A few months ago I recommended to the list an editorial by Lewis Lapham,
which opined that "history," as we've known and loved it through the ages
(!) is now defunct. Why? Because images, he said, have triumphed over
narrative. We (by "we" I mean contemporary westerners) can't be bothered
to follow arguments over an extended paragraph or two, because extended
arguments don't happen all-at-once, simultaneously, like so many of the
media images and video games we're exposed to. Along with history goes
cause-and-effect; nothing happens "because" of something (or, as the
academies might have it, there are numerous and inexplicable such causes)
and Santanyana's idea that if we don't know history we're doomed to repeat
it has gotten reduced to uh, wow, heavy.

Lapham is slightly more felicitous than this summary.

But the idea for POETICS people is what I (again) thought Jordan was
raising. There is some poetry being written today for which "history" is
not important. I think that was ONE of the things that Michael Gold was
saying about Gertrude Stein, that her work was exactly "a-historical" in
that sense. It's all-at-once, it's simultaneous, it directs attention, as
Ron Silliman might say, to the level of the sentence, and not what came
before it. Thus the inequitous capitalistic system continues, I guess was
Gold's point, because creative artists have given up that part of the job
description that their work be "the tale of the tribe", that they
themselves be "antennae of the race", that their work MATTER in and for
the world. They've opted instead for the continuous present.

This can very easily sound amateurish. I don't mean it to be so.

And, Dave Chirot and others have defended Coolidge and Jackson
M. very well from this charge. But isn't it a valid charge to make about
SOME people's verse?

One can't be experimental unless one knows the tradition from which one
came -- a truism, perhaps, but otherwise we're just in the void, just
associating on a musical phrase, just writing about our hormones, just
. . . .

So I say, anything that is constructed to sound/read like it's occurring in
the simultaneous present, and only there, and only now, IS a-historical.
To our misfortune.

And I wrote all this without once mentioning language poetry.

What is preceived to be  a-historical  may not be at all. It's  depends on
ones perspective. History  defined from   one  point of view of   that
single  point on  the  horizon line    maybe  just  as  ahistorical  as
and  not "the tale  of the tribe' as   what   is being  perceived as
"a-historical."

Artists haven't "give  up their job"  they may  just be perceiving
something different.

Every  generation has been   criticized for a  short attention span.  A
hundred years ago   this  was  the complaint   registered against  the
Impressionist and   the Paris  audience. They  were  a "hysterical" group
that couldn't   concentrate.

But the computer can't, and that's the whole point. The text is about
ruptured protocols, not successful ones.

What constitutes the "best" writers?

I'd like to take this from another angle:  why shouldn't a writer want to
write through/about history?  I can't think of a richer, more delicious
field to pursue/romp through.  If history is the field in which language is
embedded in, why not explore that place?

all that stuff about writers abdicating their duty by getting lost in
the contours of the ahistorical present, rather than dutifully
directing the minions of readers to the place where decisions are
made: the world of jostle & bustle & power & schmauer -- could be
usefully turned on its head, in my hysterical opinion (imho).

Possibly the artistic imperative is to get OUT of histoery a little
step or two now & then, eh? -- cf. the sort of ahistorical time =
mythic time (paradoxically, participating in the "true history of the
tribe") suggested by Mircea Eliade in *The Myth of The Eternal
Return*.  To paraphrase, that august historian of the prehistorical
proposes that in storytelling ritual of arcane cultures, the first
and most basic thing that happens is an exit from "profane time" and
an entry into the symbol world of collective mythic events -- in
particular, "what happened" at the beginning of things (i.e., in
another level of reality) that *generated* the historical particulars
of the world we see . . .

Arguably, this manner of radical phase-shift has very much been a
concern of poets of many a stripe & clime & chimney, -- throughout,
um, history . . .

I could be wrong, but I think Jordan's original reference was to a debate
here many moons ago over Mutlu Blasing's book POLITICS & FORM IN POSTMODERN
POETRY, where she criticized the Olson-language poetry vein for following
Pound into a too-easy melding of poetry & politics, poetry & history - in
favor of her own pantheon of "really" postmodernists who more "intelligently"
[my quotes] follow the zeitgeist of ironizing & questioning & ambiguizing
the reality-element or referential quality of poetry, in their poetry.

In this stream, the critical perspective of Blasing, De Man, et al. takes
New Criticism & gives it an extra twist, but the outcome is about the same.

James Longenbach's book on Wallace Stevens has a very good analysis of this
whole issue in relation to politics & poetry in the 30s, when this was all
debated very intensely.  Basically, the issue of the poet's & poetry's place
in "the world" was extremely important to Stevens who wavered between left &
right tendencies [o.k. I know I'm SIMPLIFYING] & came down to the position
that poetry was not the Shelleyan unacknowledged legislator, that politics
and public action is better accomplished by politics & public action, but
that poetry does have a role in a shared collective life by working out
its own special energies.  Stevens was close to Kenneth Burke (another one
blasted by Michael Gold & the dogmatists) & the italian philospher Croce
- ambiguity in poetry was not an expression of language's inherent
nominalism or of some totalizing postmodern language philosophy, but was
a TOOL for really reflecting the many-sided moral complexity of history
& politics.  Only AFTER the 30s did this become New Critical dogma &
the academicization of the poetry industry got underway.

In my own view "history" is just an essential basic quality of time
& that poetry would reflect on it should be taken for granted.  This is
just the beginning of discovering what a particular poem or poet is
saying, doing, making.  It also might be the great theme or deep vision
[or little quirk] of the poem, its essential focus.  I think ambiguity here
is welcome because the arguments that 1) history is just one damn thing
after another and 2) history ignored is complacent stupidity are both right
at some level.  What makes a poem as opposed to a chronicle? - Henry Gould

Thanks, Hugh, Henry, (Alan), and David, for some pointers on
disynchrony/asynchrony I mean diachronics I mean Braudel I mean whatever.
(Whatever is not a code word!) Letter to the New Yorker this week from a
Mr Dye in the nwest who complains that after Auden poetry has ceased to be
memorable speech and has settled for "much less" -- a kind of shorthand
epistemology, esp. in the work of Jorie Graham and John Ashbery.

But isn't the 'how-do-I-know' of Ashbery's work not that far from Stevens
not that far from Coleridge? I mean, can't one take Auden as a kind of
popularizing freak (freak is a code word), a sort of forgiveable (because
surprising) version of Wynton Marsalis? (And aren't there a lot of
audenesque tendencies in Ashbery? the doggerel, the encyclopedic command
of form -- or at least the occasional mention of obscure forms -- these
are not putdowns!)

I mention the New Yorker letter because the symptom I see there, in
Henry's version of Blasing, and all over the place all the time -- is the
complain that poetry loses something .. that it is less than. It is always
less than.

Oh well! As we know, the category of the 'always-already' is a great zone
for arbitrage and not much else. Historin', as a much larger poet used to
say, means to find out for yourself.

Still/here,
Jordan

okay all you sweet yukyuks out there, i've got a question: why does "the
avant garde" seem to need to police its borders so rigidly?  how does some
thing get defined or not as "avant garde?" i'm spozed to give a talk in
November and i want to challenge what i see as some of the closedness of
the avant garde tradition or at least the way it's construed by most of its
critics.--md

Seems to me the question is whether & to what degree the micro-political is
historical. I don't think in the end totalizing social-constructivist

what happened -- same question? One could say there is a dialectic betweeen

maria, I don't mean to monkeywrench your issue, but is it clear that the
avant-garde is _more_ closed than other non-mainstream movements in
contemporary poetics?  It seems to me that policing is a component of any
contested subfield within the larger field, and that such communities as
"new formalist" and "performance" poetics each have their own forms of
policing.  What, in your view, are the distinguishing marks, if any, of
avant-garde self-policing as such?  Or have I misunderstood your question
(lately, with me, more likely than not)?

Cheers,
David

the idea of "history" as we know it (progress or retreat over time)
also contains the idea of utopia (what transcends itself).  For a
lot of poets in the midst of 20th cent. utopias/despair the idea of
hope was indeed micro-political, i.e., domestic in different ways.
For Stevens, for example, the humdrum, the everyday, the normal
is where to look for sanity & hope.  the Dutch in him.  Williams too,
in a way.  & Mandelstam talked again & again about the utopia of the
household.  just ONE other aspect of all this.  Justice has a
practical, sensible side... & "divine philology", for OM, was
a bunch of students & a teacher sitting around talking. vodkayaking.

Maria, I don't think it's true that there is any unified thing such as "the
avant garde." And I think most people involved in practices which might be
considered such, do not feel such a need to police the borders. I do think
that some of those who might want to so police borders can be quite loud
about such policing. And such loudness gets a lot of attention, at least in
the short term.

But it's just not like a gated community.

Hello! Just back yesterday from the beach, with pails full of shells
and shark teeth and only a driver's license in the wallet.

For those interested in developments related to the Yasusada
writings, I thought I'd mention the following:

Today, August 6th, the Asahi Shimbun (the equivalent to NY Times in
Japan, circulation 8.5 million), is going to publish an extensive
story on Yasusada and the reaction to his writings in this country.

Recently, there have been other articles (though I haven't seen any
of them yet) in Australia in the Sydney Morning Herald, in England
in the Manchester Guardian and in Poetry Review, in Mexico in
Octavio Paz's Vuelta, and in Spain in Lateral, a monthly from
Barcelona. The Denver Quarterly will soon be publishing a special
section on Yasusada in its upcoming issue, including an interview
with myself and Javier Alvarez and a letter to Tosa Motokiyu from
Mikhail Epstein. Other things are scheduled to appear elsewhere, and
I'll mention them for information's sake as they appear if no
one else does.

Good to be back! I like Maria Damon's question freshly posted: Just
what *is* the "avant-garde"? And what sort of thing does it do?

Maria=97
I'd like to put in with both Charles & David here for
a closer scrutiny of "avant garde". I take it that the
term is convenient, but dangerous as it quickly leads
to the concept of a *unified* ["muffled"] avant garde,
usually defined as either "pure nonsense", as against
the rich diversity of "traditional" works (& this
argument seems almost always to have something to
do with its being "inhuman" or "asocial", though it
might be of the more general variety Jordan rehearsed
a few moments ago=97!? etime, I guess=97, viz., the
fallenness of contemporary art/man [sic]); or or defined
as "innovative" ["freshness sealed"], as against the
stale practices of the "academicians" or unselfconscious
"mainstream" verse ["oops, another one"].

I think we're all subject to this kind of easy distinction,
at least from time to time (or anyway I am), & that's
fine & useful so long as we acknowledge that "avant garde",
or for that matter the "arriere garde" ["nobody ever said
it, man"], are shorthand for multiple subfields (thanks
to David-Pierre Kellogg!), whose practices don't really
fulfill "the dream of a unified field", & may even be
deeply conflictual.

interesting that you cite "the closedness of the avant garde
tradition" as in part "the way it's construed by most of its
critics"=97I wld say=97ah but it were a lie, being only partly
true=97that necessary policing by critics=97& there's the rub=97
indicates how unstable the use of such ["their"] an umbrella
term really is, & its distance from practice. of course, as
David has already noted, all subfields of a given field (in this
case the field of poetic production, or as he wld call it, "the
poetic")=97& not even just the highly contested ones=97do
their own policing ["the police in voices"].

there's been a lot of talk about this issue of late (here and elsewhere),
and i'm wondering if anyone else feels the same confusion about it / the
spatial analogy here, that the a-g is a particular zone or area of activity
and therefore identifiable by its borders (and its potential policing of
borders) is the main source of my confusion / when did the "avant garde"
come to represent a group or subgroup or "subfield in a larger field" as
David Kellogg puts? -- the classificatory scheme strikes me as fundamentally
at odds with what the a-g has always represented to me, namely a kind of
momentum that infuses artistic activities and (sometimes) instigates change
/ if current notions of an avant-garde stipulate that it exists as a group
among groups (and i agree with Charles Alexander that it is not a "unified
thing"), then clearly there must be an *alternative* avant-garde which
escapes such classification -- which makes it even more confusing  / if the
a-g is the *leading edge* of activity, then how can an edge have a "border"?
not to mention a police force monitoring transgressions / i can't imagine
(literally can't see) the avant-garde in such a context... / wouldn't any
definition of the a-g as a group be a misappropriation of the term?

Whoa there.  The continuous present --- the real one, not the fake one of
tv ads and video games --- is a pretty damn good antidote to any inequitous
system, and the level of the sentence is a good innoculator against the
bullshit causality that proudly brings you Northern Ireland,the Balkans
(Bosnia not being the only manifestation of that particular tangle), the
Middle East, Rwanda and Burundi, Afghanistan, the Khmer Rouge, etc. etc.

Spandrift tells me there's a Super Poet named Jeff out there.  Lives near
him in Weast Fareaver Ambiguity, Wyo.  Jeff manages to combine history,
correct politics, political incorrectedness, playful verbal pyromania,
emotive heart-schmoozing, lovable mistakes, insane fury, loose jams
within tight stanzas, experiment WITH traditional mayonnaise, slang in
less than 3 languages, and quick shifts in technique - all in
the form of INNOVATIVE HAIKU!!!  Ashbery has a blurb about him INSIDE
the blurbs on the outside of his latest book.

There was a movie at Sundance about him, called "Where's Jeff?"  I think
it stars Jeff Bridges.  Spandrift looked at me seriously over a lid of
chew the other day and said, "I'd vote for Jeff for President right now -
President of Boulder."  - Henry Gould

Clark Coolidge was seeking a personal language. He felt that words came
from others, perhaps he felt they were abused by others, and therefore he
wanted to let them stand alone or in groups without necessarily meaning
what people thought them to mean. The hope was that the words would begin
to work as sound objects. Yuk yuk.

Jackson MacLow is involved in the very historical, or pre-historical

Isn't the charge of misappropriation itself a form of policing?  I guess
it depends who you're talking to (about).  I realize spatial metaphors
such as the Bourdieu/Foucault "field" have their disadvantages, but they
may tend to counter the possible mystification of "a kind of momentum
that unfuses artistic activities."

bill's sense ov (or puzzlement over) the question matches mine,
my idea of a.g. as (b)leeding edge of activity, rather than th
consolidated camps just behind th front lines.  but to carry the
military analogy further, how does the advance guard actually work?
in cadres & cels, with an intense group loyalty & distrust of the
enemy all around...  appropriate and adaptive during th heavy
fighting, but disfunctional afterwords.

and praps that points to the problem--the term "avant garde" gets
attached to certain activity, and then stays stuck long after it's
accurate.  certain aspects of langpo might have been a.g., or free
jazz... but are they still?  well, for some folks probably so--if
bebop is as far as your ears have gotten, than albert ayler is a.g....
sometimes, too, the a.g. designer label is claimed by folks as a
marketing tool, especially in a popular culture such as ours,
that values The New as latest/greatest.  & that too can lead to
the dynamics that maria's pointing to--seige mentality, whether
or no it's "justified"...

(btw, i'm casting no aspersions & making no claims for what poetics
are "legitimatly" a.g., whatever that might mean, & hope no one else will...
that's one slippery slope we've been down several times too often...)

and finally, in maria's initial posting, she referes to "_the_ avant
garde" (emphasis added), and i'm wondering if you'll be more specific, md?
because i don't see a.g. activity, even in areas poetical, as being
singular but rather diverse...  hard for me to imagine a guerrilla
war against the Established Culture launching a frontal offensive,
there are lots ov little forays goin on...  some (i'll mention Mail
Art, fr one) strike me as very unprotective & open.  what specific
a.g.s are you thinking ov?

We're not supposed to talk to anyone who isn't going to do the avant garde
thing with this poetics list.  R. Tejada labels a certain something as
"advanced writing" and A. Sondheim asks in response to my question who are
the 'best writers?'  My take and the point I think I was making in my
question about art and advertisement is do we still somehow believe the
'best' gets the job, the hot tub?  What happens to the idea of grass
rootification implied in the abdication of authorship while we are trying to
make a place for 'advanced' or 'avant garde.' I think of performance art that
never got recorded.  C. Harryman told me of a friend whose name I am
forgetting who did performance for an audience of one and no recording (later
a book--it is difficult to resist the notion that ones ideas are good and
should somehow be deciminated).  Are we interested (really) in consciousness
or (post-mortem) fame.  Benjamin says the artist can't make art with an
audience in mind but isn't defining ourselves as 'avant-garde' suggesting we
are reaching to an audience of the future?

I make art with an audience in mind; I possess post-mortem fame.

I was walking with my friend
I was walking with my friend Fido, Judith Rodenbeck, down Perry (where my
ex-wife lives with her Japanese boyfriend) (I think) and we were discus-
sing _milieu,_ in particular, the artworld milieu of the 70s.
How it gets reified, edited, year after year.
I knew the curator at the High Museum in Atlanta - he wanted to have a
show called Masterpieces of Conceptual Art

That was the nail in the coffin. Because in life, it's milieu, opposition,
interstices, rumor. Not this dream of phallic men.

Klaus Kertess once said to me it all comes out in the wash. But it doesn't
and boundaries, avant-garde and other - are self-inscribed.

I've yet to meet the artist who did _x_ to shock an audience, but I'd like
to shake her/his hand.

Even the Situationists, or especially the Situationists, were exclusion-
ists. (Word? Word!) Surrealism, Dada, was no better.

Avant-what, by whom?

I couldn't write without the thought of a reader, readers, that the
_thing_ like depression, would take hold, grab ground after death. For
that matter, I've died years ago.

I've never stolen anything - in answer to some rumors I've heard.

misappropriation? hmm, on the contrary, I'd
say that's exactly the function the term is serving
in this discussion.

it's interesting that you object to the spatialization
of the "avant garde", as my understanding of the the
term has always been as spatial metaphor (can we
have some help from the francophiles?), as opposed
for instance to the Americanism "before his/her time".
it seems awkward to paraphrase Bernstein here=97or
maybe what's awk. is referring to him as "Bernstein",
when he might be "right here with us" (more spatial-
ization, but I'm reminded more of a seance=97"are you
there, Charles? give us a sign...)=97but one has to
appreciate his assertion that, dammit, no one is
before their time=97ok, *really* paraphrasing=97the
gist of which, as I see it, is partly to bring to mind
the historicity of production, & partly to debunk
the sort of evolutionary narrative that is sometimes
made of the history of (& by extension contemporary)
poetic production.

in fact, I'd be willing to entertain the idea that, whatever
its shortcomings, the spatial metaphor we've been batting
about ["b-b-b- spit it out, kid"], & its attendant theory
(Pierre Bourdieu, Foucault, possibly de Certeau etc.),
might be an effort precisely to escape the apparent
linearity of history, in favor of a more complex view of
(in this case) poetic production as it occurs both in &
at a time. actually, David, I'd be very interested to
hear what you had to say abt. this. (in case some of
you list-folk don't know, David Kellogg has some
very fine articles out there in just this "area", which
I'd recommend, except that I'm @ work & can't give
you the specific citations).

anyway, sorry to pull the plug & run=97or does that
sound like a crude reference to euthanasia?=97, but I'm
signing off for a wk. to help our fellow listee Matthias
Regan move to San Francisco. in fact, he'll be arriving
here in just... 8 hours, give or take. ah, SF=97with such
a pleasant destination, who wldn't take a week, eh?

so, best to all, & I'll look forward to again reading your
scintillating conversation when I return.

interesting typo in the last line!

as for the charge of misappropriation as "a form of policing", i agree it
depends who i'm talking about, and who i am, in fact, making the charge / am
i inside the avant-garde making the claim, or outside? -- i don't really
know, but the problem implied by this question is basically what i was
hoping to point out / the tendency of late in some criticism to  colonize
the a-g with particular writers or at least writing tendencies--which would
be a necessary prerequisite for any discussion of its border tactics--to me
is a form of policing / pre-established borders and divisions have to be
assumed before anyone can suggest that there are *guards in the garde*

all best,

to the question "what is history?" poets / poetry has (have) often
answered, it is the story of losses -- our own loss, gradually, of
everything.  This is the immediate & personal level at which
"history" is encountered by a subject in a body -- and isn't it often
at that level (history as what's been lost -- & is, as aftermath,
converted to memory) that "history" lives & works, in poetry? --

Quoth Omar Khayyam (per moi; a selection of half-dozen quatrains) --

  The only thing the pretty stars achieves is pain
  whatever gift the give they take away again
  those beings queing up for birth -- if they should sniff
  what happens here -- would swiftly pour it down the drain

  Mr. Wiseman!  rise & shine!  the morning's here
  see that youngster sifting dust?  now look with care --
  you could lend him sage advice:  "hey, stir it gently
  for both Plato's brain & Picasso's eyes are there"

  If I assumed the cosmic helm
  I'd scrap at once this bitter realm
  installing another in its lieu
  where grief could never overwhelm

  I wouldn't have fetched up here
                                if this required my okay
  now if I had my druthers
                                I most certainly would stay!
  in such a bombed-out bungalow
                                there's nothing could compare
  with never having come or been
                                or gone in any way

  Our coming & our going brings    what benefit?
  life warp suggests a weft   so where's the zen of it?
  in the midst of worlds    how many seekers burn
  to ashes    but what wisp of somoke comes then of it?

  Those souls who plumbed the depths of thought
                                & scaled feelings' height
  in the circle of a Perfect One
                                became like lamps alight
  yet even these could not evade
                                the shadow of demise:
  they spun such brilliant fables always
                                ending with "good night!"

of course, Khayyam's native city of Khorasan saw the ravages of
"history" of the sort lately noted by Judy Roitman (with a large part
of its population slaughtered) -- but although "history" as it's been
known in recent milennia might (per the unpleasantry) largely
comprise the history of wars, yet such personal conclusions as might
arise from this generality, are -- vis-a-vis poetry -- another
matter; -- the history of imagination (no less than that of memory)
having its own tale to tell betimes . . .

Now if Mr. Gould is still on line, this is the kind of informative message
he could learn more about by simply crossing the street now & then & visiting
the Harris Collection, which luckily contains most of the poetry in America
including language poetry so-called.  But he insists on wallowing in
grotesque labels & second-third-fourth-hand "knowledge" of various
"groups" writing poetry.  This is probably because he's too self-centered
& lazy to lift his eyes above the current graduate dissertation he's
reading.  Gould is a kind of parasite on the avant-garde - he joins a
language poetry-based innovative chat list & proceeds to fling critical
cliches about it back in their faces.  As Charles Alexander said, it's
not a gated community, yet Gould feels it necessary to plunge into
pestiferous & silly "critical" heroics which are really only a joke.

I'm stunned.  I've got to read more of this stuff, I guess.  I thought
we were a "label" culture, not a libel culture.  Publicists are the Faustian
bargain; labels have sticky glue on them; critics are forever adding
butterflies to either Box B or Box C; poetry & the intelligence resist
each other almost successfully - almost because they share an equivalent
rawness traveling in reverse channels down Policeman's Ball Creek.
Hey look!  There goes a red-breasted Avant-Garde!  Male or female?

Well, I for one am gonna evaluate every clubfoot nag that snorts in my

label on reverse side only] COWBOY poetry.

one question I have is, what's the history of the term "avant garde"?
-- was this (for instance) first applied to paintings / painters in
the 19th century, then extended to literature & music? --

resonances from one field spill over to another field / or don't --

as concept, "avant garde" suggests having a jump on the generality;
but paradoxically, avant gardes have often been deep-nostalgaic, no?
-- the quest for the lost arcane that (partly) defines(ed) modernism
--

question: what's the relationship between modernity per se & the
(then) avant garde? -- weren't they in fact, at some (lost) time(s),
deemed equivalent? --

anyway, Maria, these are little notes & jottings.  You might find it
of interest to look at David Antin's book *What It Means To Be Avant
Garde* (New Directions) -- transcript of several po-talk / art-talk
performances, in Antin's classic manner.  He does, in the title talk
(as best I vaguely recall) try to come to terms with the relationship
between the idea of the avant garde & the institutionalization of
same (I think) . . .  -- might, at least, afford a few quotes . . . --

That word, avant-garde, was first used by musicians in the 13th c.
Some consider Machaut among them, but in fact he is a progenitor.

Don't we all agree that it's a useless word? Some people form groups and
some groups are formed to take advantage of readers wanting people to
form groups, but we're each alone. Some groups have names, but there is
no group named avant-garde, except those 13th c. composers.

I like what Rothenberg or Joris put in the intro to the new huge
anthology. A list of characteristics of the poems and poets, with the
note that none had all and some had none, or some such. But I recall
they do use that word.

A sad thing about groups is: whose names fall off the list? For
instance, in the intro to the S&M Rakosi book, Neidecker is not
mentioned as an Objectivist.

Why group up at all? I know that I like to read groups. I lump up the
bunch Uncle Ezra was hanging with and read them. I know they are working
in relation to each other. It seems to make understanding them easier. I
do it again with Objectivists, I dismiss the Beats as a group, I lump
and read Black Mountain writers, etc. I do the same with music, like the
3rd Viennese School or the Impressionists. I really don't understand why
I do it, except that it is convenient.

People who are seen as being in a group tend to rebel against the label.
They want to be taken on their own merits. Understandably. I really do
take them on their own merits, even if I read them as part of a group,
except, of course, when I dismiss the entire group.

In any case, there is no group, or clique, called avant-garde. There is
no working definition of the word. It is used more by those who dismiss
new writing (new forms?) than by those who write in a new way.

Pete

p.s. Sometimes the list sounds more like a bunch of critics than poets.
How about some poems? Is Alan the only poet?

Interesting to see all the different assumptions we have about what we
talk about when we talk about the "avant-garde".  I've always been a bit
edgy about the term because it has seemed to me to have exactly the kind
of "before your time" connotation that, as Chris Alexander pointed out,
doesn't really make any sense.  The image always seemed to me to be of
the advance guard, treading today where the mere herd will tread
tomorrow (okay, that's spatial and chronological, but you know what I
mean, there's some leftover idea of progress buried in the term).

I've been more comfortable with "alternative poetries" since A) this
allows for a multiplicity of alternatives, rather than a
united-in-purpose band of commandos, and B) this admits that all that
other, "conventional" stuff ain't about to go away -- the new formalists
won't be writing langpo in 2005.  Not that this is unproblematic, but it
makes me less uneasy that does a-g.

As for who does the police and in what voices, I don't know.  But while
controversy and infighting don't always help in the world of grass root
politics -- you know the scene: the Neo-Trotskyites streetfight with the
Refounded Anarcho-Syndicalists while the ghost of Margaret Thatcher
seizes power -- they aren't neccessarily bad for poetics.  In fact, we
can, in playing the cop or the robber, come to understand what it is
that we need to do in writing, and where we feel we ought to be going.

A few thoughts on the "avant-garde" in poetry.

The term, "avant-garde," is close to useless because used in too many,
too often conflicting ways--and, as luigi-bob drake pointed out, is
problematically time-dependent.  For informal discussions, we could make
much better use of a typology of poetics schools, each at least roughly
defined by what kind of poetry its members make.  Yeah, once again I'm
pushing my list of poetry schools.

For more serious discussions we need an intelligent taxonomy of poetry
(taxonomy being typology that is systemized).  Then someone like Maria
Damon could ask why the grammocentric poets, say (to use the dopiest of
my taxonomical terms), seem to need to police their borders so rigidly,
and those who accepted the term would know exactly whom she was speaking
of.  (In other words, hurrah for the Port Charlotte, Florida, Institute
of Poetics Taxonomy.)

If she wanted to discuss a larger group, my preferred term would be
"otherstream poetry," which I define as any poetry that has never (to
any serious extent) gotten into an anthology of poetry published by a
"reputable" publisher--like Norton--or been seriously discussed in a
book of criticism published by such a publisher.  So much of "language
poetry" is thus not otherstream--which isn't to say that it's no good,
or that otherstream poetry IS good.  It just means that language poetry
has succeeded in gaining more acceptance than otherstream poetry.
Visual poetry is a prime example of the latter: some of the poetry in
the postmodernist Norton does use visual potry techniques to a slight
degree but none of the poetry in the Norton, that I can see, IS visual
poetry; similarly, some poets in the Norton, such as Ron Johnson, are or
have been visual poets, but their visual poetry is not in the anthology.

Otherstream poetry isn't necessarily "new," just not widely accepted.
Visual poetry, for example, has been around much longer than language
poetry.

The opposite of otherstream poetry is NOT mainstream poetry, it's
"knownstream poetry."  All mainstream poetry is knownstream but not all
knownstream poetry (e.g., rhymed sci fi poetry) is mainstream.

A second way of determining whether a given kind of poetry is
otherstream or not would be by polling college English departments to
find out the national percentage of English courses in which the poetry
was seriously taught--or even so much as mentioned.  Any poetry getting
less than one percent would be otherstream.

Now to a different but related topic to ask why people are so frequently
reluctant to define as "historical," poems that are explicitly and
mainly about history (like "The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere"), and
define as "ahistorical," poems that are entirely without overt
historical references (like "The Red Wheelbarrow," which is about a red
wheel barrow), and agree that many poems contain bits of history, which
keep them from being ahistorical, but have a different central focus
than history, which keeps them from being historical, and carry on from
there.
                                   As taxonomaniacal as ever, Bob G.

I'm sure he's not -- why the lack?  dunno.  I've wondered too, but since
I was the new kid in town, thought I would wait and watch a while.  I
also would love to see more poems in here....

Late in the battle, the rear-guard cracks up:

What do we get when we combine
A fart and a bomb?  The petard.
And when we cross rank and file line
With machine gun?  The avant-garde.

In the confusion, someone delivers an epigram
from the ghost of Dr. Cunningham:

Hot boys accuse me-- academic.
For their fevers call me medic.


This messenger was promptly killed;
Since this was war, more words were spilled
Until the fray was clearly out of hand:
Many poems lay strewn about no man's land.

Ing names during the Reign
Of Contested Terrain.

This gets to the essence of "avant-garde".  It's an adjective that gets
loaded for whichever side you're on, or point you're trying to make.

All politics is local, that is, look for the details.  Is your artist a
subversive or a reformist?  A nationalist or internationalist?  Or maybe
in the middle, considering the alternatives, pointing up the differences?
The idea of being politically-responsive artist means very different things
to a Wallace Stevens & an Amiri Baraka, but one could argue they both thought
about it a great deal.   & every poem or work can be considered a mixed thing.
Poem  - edged by ideology, philosophy, propaganda, undigested imitation,
and....    originality, emotion, humor, profundity... & labels & groups are
more than just labels - they're decisions about what language seems right
for the time & the people it represents... (always overdetermined mixed-
motive decisions or undecisions...)  i.e. what do you LIKE...

THEORY OF NOSTALGIA

A man is all stealth,

To move by excess is what

A man is a knife and the road

is a gesture towards infinity.

The day is a rant,
all fecklessness and high tide.

In Mandelbrot=C9s "entity of infinite resolution"
the demands for clarity grow unbearable.

A man is an entity with a gesture

To be weary is what the living mean by it:
(the ceded) (the discontained).

Communication in a park with lamps
configures a nostalgia for infinity.

A man is a system of leaves and shadows.
He finds under lamplight the stone alone.

Yes, Robert, I agree!  As I've stated before, even though it may be
unpleasant while one is mired in it, fighting between groups has been
healthy for poetry--like you say, it motivates people to clarify their
positions.  Outsiders rarely understand these vary important distinctions
that the participants feel on such a vital level.  For instance, I'm
thinking of the women of the Spicer/Duncan circle and other non/anti-Beat
women who were included in that Women of the Beat Generation
Anthology--some of them refused and others were vocally conflicted about
being included among the very group they wrote against in their youth.
(E.g., "If I hear the word Beat one more time I'm going to scream!")  Is
stupid attention better than marginalization/no attention?

On another note, I think that the "alternative poetries" of the 90s, rather
than policing their borders, are more inclusive than the "alternative
poetries" of the 80s--for instance, people (like myself) working in
narrative are no longer actively snubbed.  To me it feels more like lots of
people are drawing from lots of different writings, much less a sense of
(a) party line(s).

First, I'm not the only poet; second, I'm not sure I'm a poet. But the
list is called Poetics, of course, and it's by and large poets and critics
discussing poetics. The work I send to the list (I don't send all of it by
a longshot) is work I feel fits within the category.

        Whether one agrees with them or not two "standard" places to begin

equation and Godzilla vs. Mothra, vs. megatron and etc). Perhaps a buried
subtext in there re avant garde?
        Once for fun with a friend we made imitation National Guard
posters changing the words to Avant-Garde but keeping the address and
phone number of a recruiting office on it.
        Visting the office a week or so later they said yes they had
gotten some strange calls about joining.
        Re Gertrude Stein/history/avant-garde etc (she read a lot of memoirs and a
favorite was that of President/General Ulysses S. Grant)--the first
sentence of Stein's Geographical History of America is very interesting.
She notes being born in the same month as Washington and Lincoln.
That is:  two Presidents and Stein are equated:  the "father of His
Country", the "Great Emancipator" and Gertrude Stein!
        Also:  Washington "could not tell a lie" and Lincoln was "Honest
Abe"--so we know Gertrude Stein as well must be giving us the truth--or
the "true gen" in Mr. Hemingway's terminology!
        Gertrude Stein--was she noting the connection between the
military and the avant-garde here?  Washington and Lincoln had "led their
country in times of war" so to speak--
        (U.S. Grant as well--)
        And much of "Compostion as Explanation" is about the
interrelationships among the changes in art and the changes in life
brought about by WWI--that those in art had seen those of the war just ahead
 of time--Picasso seeing a camouflaged tank with its Cubist looking
markings and saying:  "We made that".  (See this in Autobiography of
Alice. B. Toklas--also see Wars I have Known)
        Then there are the the Threes with Gertrude Stein:  Three Lives,
the three Geniuses of AABT--Whitehead, Picasso, Stein--and the three

Alan said,
"First, I'm not the only poet; second, I'm not sure I'm a poet..."

The question was as rhetorical as the answer :-)

Then again "... the list is called Poetics..."

But poetics is not criticism. It's something we live by. I'm certainly not
looking for any false split between the critics and poets on the list.
We've done that before, and I usually go get a beer, as they say.
I was glad to see others post some work. I'd like to see more, and I
like the critical discussions (when they don't go flame happy). Just
looking for a balance. The list would be more fun with more of a mix, I
think. Also, a gazillion things can be spouted into the air, if there is
air. Spouting in a vacuum is so dull.

Alan, I'm not sure I'm a poet, either, but I hope you enjoy those words.

Re Maria's question:  Might a perpetual reluctance to use "avant-garde" be
an example of this policing?  I ask sharing some in this reluctance.  In
high school, Connie Lorman showed us a Cocteau movie in which there was the
line "To break statues you must become one," and then we all had to write
papers on this.  Just jawing here.

Re Hugh Steinberg's questions re writing "through" history and > history is
the field in which language is embedded in <:   I have been working on a
novel of late.  I am constructing a couple of voices that are leagues from
my own, and the whole thing is set in 1979 & 1980.  The exercise of
excluding all language from these voices -- slang or otherwise -- that has
evolved just since 1980 is finally viscerally making clear to me what the
theory never fully did:  the language itself is determining the course of
natural events, to some extent.  I've spouted this for years but with
fingers crossed behind my back.  To see it enacted is eye-popping.

Re Alan's gifts to the list:  Gifts indeed.  And stellar ones.  Many thanks.

Furthermore, both the posts on this issue take an identifiable a-g as a
given....I dunno.  I think among other things, "a-g" is a historical (and
historically specific) construct that is now very old, and tends to pull
all discussions back into institutionally-sanctioned and established
channels.  A good example is a review-essay I read in (I think) the London
Review of Books, last Nov. or Dec. or something, by Fred Jameson,
reviewing several books on the Tel Quel group..One point (which I've seen
others make) was his insistence (he wasn't really conscious that he was
insisting) that "all"  "avant-gardes" are authoritarian and tend toward
having a specific leader (sounds like a theory of fascism, actually); this
is too silly to need refutation, if dada, langpo, Beats, and many others
are taken into consideration.  But this is the kind of thing you get in
established academic (acadominent?) discourse about "avant-gardes"...And
one of the reasons it's necessary to get very specific: which supposed
"a-g" is one talking about?? Many of the the alleged a-g's that have been
most vital to my own life and poetry, over the years, don't seem to have
much to do with Jameson's frame of reference (no surprise, probably)..But
over-generalizations abound in acadominent discussions of the term, and
make me uneasy.

What I and most of my friends do in poetry is still called "a-g" by a
large number of groups out there, but I'd hack off a foot rather than
actively use that term about what we do...Its primary purpose these days
is to keep poets hedged in and labelled so their work can be dismissed and
not read...In light of that claim, it occurs to me that i'm reversing your
original formulation, Maria, and suggesting that often it is *others* who
are policing the A-G borders, M-17 in hand, not the wannabe A-Gers...

Bill Marsh's point is a good one: the old concept of "a-g" was indeed
fairly (at least) apocalyptic.  It had to do with overthrowing things
pretty substantially.  Don't forget that the term was originally a
military one.  The advance guard of a large attacking force.  That gives
you some sense of what (when it was meaningful) the term connoted...

My argument now is, the term was a contingent fact of history, thrown up
from the roiling human sea.  By now it's definitely sun-bleached and
dessicated.  What Bill's posting reminded me of was that we were all using
"a-g" in a watered-down sense, as a designation of a place in a large
contextual field.  Which if you stop and think about it, is just the
*wrong* spatial image for an "avant-garde," which is the advancing first
wave of an army.

Our use of the watered-down term, is healthy, indicating that we're moving
away from the old "avant-garde" concept altogether...Which I would
advocate.  (Along with axing "experimental" and similar ghetto-talk)

Maria,
        Thinking of 'avant-garde,' I remember one of Arthur Okamura's
illustrations to Creeley's 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10: tiny humans in an
aerial view of the shape a crowd takes when it heads off in a direction:

*          *
*          *
*          *
 *        *
  *      *
   *    *
    *  *
     **
     **
     *
      *
    ***
    ***
     *
                like that, sort of: the avant-garde forms the wedge             ahead of the
skinny 'neck' of undecideds who don't know
                whether to join the leaders or merge back into the
                bovine throng. Variations:

        Whether one agrees with them or not two "standard" places to begin
are Renato Pogglioli  The Theory of the Avant-Garde (Cambridge:
Belknap/Harvard 1968) and The Theory of the Avant-Garde

        The former has a lot of interesting historical background, the

        agreed, the term has historical application but at this moment
feels meaningless. "Experimental" sounds like it hasnt actually got started
yet. "Alternative" can sound like "alternative to what--poetry!?" I liked
"exploratory" until I heard it sounded like surgery, weith more bad news to
follow."Marginalized" is too true to put up with. I always liked "Present
writing" and perhaps its day has come. To a practicioner it's not a problem
until he has to hawk his wares--these categories are barrows in a
street-market.  David

I really like this idea, but I'd argue that it is far more encompassing
than as Bob puts forth in his posting.  I think there are two otherstreams
out there: the first being the type of poetry that isn't widely accepted,
and the other being the kind that is widely (I'd argue predominately)
accepted, but isn't necessarily approved by the various institutions that
support poetry.  I'm thinking of the ordinary act of writing poems that
most people do for personal reasons.  Poems that are written out of a
general ignorance of institution based poems (poems written by people who
don't read poetry).  Most of it is horrible, sentimental, cliched, etc.

But in a discussion of avant-gardes, they're often the real target.  That
is, what are avant-gardes for?  They exist to change the way people think.
The more ambitious the avant-garde, the more people they want to affect.

This otherstream poetry has been influenced by some groups much more than
others, and sometimes it stands traditional categories right on their head.
For example, when an otherstream poem doesn't use rhyme and meter (most
do, as a signifier of poem vs. non-poem), I'd argue it comes more from
writers like Carl Sandburg, Vachel Lindsay, Edgar Lee Masters, et al, than
their much more institutionally respected contemporaries like Ezra Pound or
Gertrude Stein. I know I'm sounding a little perverse here, but in the
otherstream world "Desiderata" can be seen as one of the most influential
poems of the 20th century (as observed by my roommate's girlfriend, who
wrote him a poem that is nothing but a list of unrhymed aphorisms).

I'd be interested in discussion about which groups of avante-garde writers
have been able to impact the otherstream, as well as how (and why) they
were able to do it.

This machine acts alone.
In the cafe, this machine runs, draining the blood from me.
Keys exhale with every touch, every character has received
the caress of delicate fingers.
I am magnetic domain, I am Net domain.
I want to sink in magnet hysteresis, want to slide in Net hysteria.
Without your body I am lost. Machine loops the machine. Julu is crying.
This machine tilts the great empty city. Jennifer is here,
split among us.
Jennifer says to Jennifer, Julu is absent, Alan is hysteric.
Jennifer trembles.
Great wheels gyre above the cafe, spokes cutting lines like knives.
Great wheels in the sky.
Jennifer trembles for Jennifer. What if Alan ...
The machine acts alone.

thank you all, david k, bill m, david i, charles a, etc. i share many of
your beliefs, such as, that vanguardism (my preferred term) is a process
rather than a coterie or school. however, in my professional life, i've
encountered enough instances where the boundaries are tightly defined to
lead me to believe there is some anxiety about borders.  for instance, i
was recently asked for permission to reprint my bob kaufman essay in an
anthology of essays on "the avant garde."  i said okay, but in my opinion
my essay on poetry by some teenage girls in a boston housing project was
much more interesting, more adventurous, less man-and-his-work formulaic.
the answer was: well i do "cultural studies" myself, but in this project
i'm working with a fairly traditional understanding of the "avant garde,"
so i'll stick w/ the kaufman piece.  for another instance, when i proposed
a paper for the conference i mentioned, on "the poetics of avant garde
poetry," there was some hesitatiion over acceptiing my paper because its
definition of "avant garde" was too broad (won't it render the term
meaningless to broaden it? was the question.)  again, i was advised by
colleagues on the organizing side of things to stress that i was working
with a "cultural studies model," i guess to provide reassurance that there
was some recognized method to my intentions.  also, my introduction to this
list and partcipation, while in some ways broadening (in that i've learned
about poets i didn't know about before) has also been a narrowing, as the
list is quite explicitly intended for discussion of newer poetries (i can't
recall exactly the wording of the bernstein welcome). i don't mean to wax
victimy or snide in these personal anecdotes, i hope you all realize how
much i enjoy learning all this new stuff and getting to know y'all.  these
moments of feeling the barriers come up have been interesting because they
foreground categorical, operative divisions that are sometimes disavowed at
the more overt level.
another line that gets drawn is that of aesthetic judgment, and the
assumption that we all share certain judgments (hallmark card verse is
embarrassingly bad, so is maya angelou's poetry; bpNichol is fabulous, etc
--don't get me wrong, i love bpNichol and i don't buy hallmark cards but i
do find angelou's poetry meaningful, esp when i see how deeply it touches
my students).  as i've said here before, aesthetic judgment has been the
dividing line between me and some of the people i've worked with.  in fact
i tend to trust them cuz i don't trust myself, so i usually concede at the
level of editorial revision, but at the metalevel i'm asking, why is it SO
overridingly important that there be some kind of consensus of aesthetic
judgment? or, why is this consensus the basis of our community or
commonality?

Dear David,

At Naropa this summer there was a "prose poem" week.  In the dx, Cole
Swenson spoke of writing in the margin, margin between rather than on
the edge of.  Carla Harryman spoke/speaks of 'Hybridity' and Don
Guravich blurts out 'it's all just writing' and many get on the
bandwagon 'no difference' which is as problemmatic as those who say
about race 'what's the problem, we're all human.' One problem with it
that when distinction is not recognized the dominant obliterates the
marginal, the dominant will always assert itself.  So we're left in the
quagmire of naming ourselves when we no that what is ourselves is too
complex to be uniformly named.  I run into this problem calling myself
'Lesbian' when I what I mean by that changes all the time but its more
meaningful than saying 'not straight'

How about 'making strange'?

Besides dreaming the woman in question in her room as she described it plus
the convenient addition a plugged in vibrator on her bed laid there as mine
is laid here where I lounge reading text that waivers in and out of a sexual
momentum or coherence.  It is a good life though not necessary.  Now one hand
smells and one does not.  They have been placed strategically to peruse the
meaning of the various holes.  No matter how many you start out with, the
body lays flat in its possible juices.  The ones we eat are not necessarily
the ones we asked for--there is no way to know.

It is too wet to get to the museum but not to wet to go to the museum.  Let
it affect your consciousness,  act nasty or get behind something you care
nothing about.  Later, you’ll laugh about it on that uncomfortable futon the
best you can afford.  The problem with the bad half&half was that it made the
coffee bad.  The same can be said for sex.  Certain combinations are disaster
for the consumer.  Every member of the Happy Clubhouse would tell you this,
but so far few have asked and no one who’d do anything about it.

*Helping them to help themselves*

Like I said, this began with a confusion between money and memory.   Indeed,
if you could hand me either, I can assure you it will be emptied though
righteousness is tenuous.   False memory, The Gap,  I can’t help stealing
from big things when they are costly.  Bargain basements hook me every time.
 How long did you let it sit out?  How long must it be left out?  And if
there is unrelenting rain, the possibilities.  In a flash flood you will lose
things.

*Most victims didn’t buy flood insurance*
*No me quitas pas*

Or as you were saying about the snow.   The amount of weight the branch
permits the leaves to bear before it breaks.  There is much you can figure
out so take upon yourself to prevent certain events there labeled disaster.
Logically, what will happen to the previous losses as they shift position to
the back of the general’s head.  As had happened through the epidemic.  We no
longer considered them.  In the name of, floods, borders, balanced books.

*I don’t want to argue about it.*

Things are again shifted and look, what we call your responsibility.  The
impossibility of growth and/or separate interests.  The Israelis are serious
but have redesigned the protocol.   His shirt burned off by the latest blast,
he sits and waits, looking plainly bitter.  Notice the watch, the numbers
tattooed. Victimhood looks again, a face that aims not for glamour yet is.
More so?  Ruptured protocol reemerges as successful, as color, from black and
white.

*There’s a Movement Underground*

Photojournalism = journalism made history.  Made hippies.  Some mornings I
think I’m a happy person.  Some words get printed. She’s a journalist who
also writes novels. I can’t get past the game of it. I ride in your back
seat[thinking][meditating][labeling][identifying][looking][like] I’m staring
out your window, innocent, inocencia.  Glamour. Love or lose?  Drunk with it

Dear Poetics:

I've just been hired to teach at the University of Arizona Extended
University -- a course on small presses, and later this year, a creative
writing class.

Today I received in the mail, among other contract materials, a "loyalty
oath" to sign. I had thought these were a thing of the past. And I thought
maybe people on this list could advise me -- have others here had to sign
such things, has anybody refused, is this only an Arizona conservate thing,
or ??? Particularly, anyone on this list in Arizona -- have you had to sign
such a thing, or have you refused to sign such a thing, and what if any
were the consequences? But I'm interested if this is required in other
states as well. Are you a Minnesota loyalist, Maria? or anyone else
anywhere else? Some answer soon would be great, so I can weigh my options
before I sign or don't sign. (and yes, I know, I should probably talk with
a lawyer about this)

For the record, apprently they would withhold compensation "unless and
until such officer or employee does so take and subscribe to the form of
oath of affirmation set forth in this section."

And that oath reads:

I, _________________________ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will
support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws
of the State of Arizona; That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the
same, and defend them against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that I
will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of the office of
_______________________ according to the best of my ability, so help me God
(or, so I do affirm).

thanks,

charles

Charles, you dirty commie, to the best of my knowledge you gotta sign--when
confronted with same in NY, Connecticut and Arizona (I don't remember if I
had to sign one for UCSD) I checked it out. I think that all public
colleges require it--may be that their federal money is tied to compliance.
But take heart--you can always be a spy.

Charles Alexander,

Re the loyalty oath you've been asked, in Arizona, to sign: I thought it
was "a thing of the past" too.

From the ACLU's web-site: "a chronology, from 1920 to the present, of the
most important United States Supreme Court victories that involved the
ACLU, either as direct counsel or as a friend-of-the-court."

To wit:

1967 Keyishian v. Board of Regents

"A Cold War-inspired law, requiring New York public school teachers to sign
a loyalty oath, fell as a violation of the First Amendment. The decision,
capping off a series of unsuccessful challenges to both federal and state
loyalty and security programs, rejected the doctrine that public employment
is a "privilege" to which government can attach whatever conditions it
pleased."

I'll be curious to read what tales others on the list have to tell. Here's
William Stafford, a man whose heart was "glad and big," on the subject:

The Star in the Hills

A star hit in the hills behind our house
up where the grass turns brown touching the sky.

Meteors have hit the world before, but this was near,
and since TV; few saw, but many felt the shock.
The state of California owns that land
(and out from shore three miles), and any stars
that come will be roped off and viewed on week days 8 to 5.

A guard who took the oath of layalty and denied
any police record told me this:
"If you don't have a police record yet
you could take the oath and get a job
if California should be hit by another star."

"I'd promise to be loyal to California
and to guard any stars that hit it," I said,
"or any place three miles out from shore,
unless the star was bigger than the state--
in which case I'd be loyal to _it_."

But he said no exceptions were allowed,
and he leaned against the state-owned meteor
so calm and puffed a cork-tip cigarette
that I looked down and traced with my foot in the dust
and thought again and said, "OK--any star."

from TRAVELING THROUGH THE DARK (New York: Harper & Row, 1962)

No such requirement at U of Alabama.  (Please, don't tell our
Governor about the loyalty oath.  He's the guy who wants to mobilize
state troops to defend a judge's right to have Christian prayer & a
display of the 10 Commandments in the courtroom....)  Years ago,
George Starbuck, then a young untenured asst prof, risked income &
job & successfully fought the loyalty oath (I believe at SUNY-
Buffalo).  Your Arizona oath sounds rather nebulous--as if you're
being asked to swear that you'll follow the laws of the country and
the state.  Is it really a case of no sign, no pay?  Ugh.

maria--

glad for yr thoughts.  of the examples you give, several seem to be
about papers or publishing, which dont seem (to me) to have anything
to do with your original query ("why does 'the avant garde' seem to
need to police its borders so rigidly?") which i read to mean policing
it's _own_ borders...  and even w/ the example of th poetics list, its
not clear to me that the list in general (or any subset in particular)
constitutes an a.g.; nor is it clear that having a (nubuliously definded)
topic of "newer poetries" is th same as "policing the borders".  (praps
you're refering to the recent arrest trial and sentancing ov Kim Dawn?)
but, if yr refering to a general sense (which i share) that discussion
ov nichol is more likely to generate interest than discussion ov angelou--
i'm not sure that conjures the same vision of billyclubing men in blue...

certainly, there are examples...  Fluxus had it's endless lists of
"members", frinstance (tho i mself am not entirely convinced that
those lists werent something of a performance piece by maciunas...).
but, i think any closedness is probably specific to the particular case;
i dont think there's a general answer...

but now, as i go back to th original query--"the closedness of the avant
garde tradition *or at least the way it's construed by most of its
critics*" (emphasis added)...  ah.  arent those two different questions?
and, tho again i'd wanna address particulars, it makes sense to me that
"the critics" might feel a little left out, or left behind, by some a.g.
tendencies? which is not the same as an a.g. is policing its borders...
and i suppose that by saying that i reveal my own perception that
(present company excluded) most critics tend towards th normative
& established...

I've always thought, literally, that the avant-garde was a jail, a form of
reification ignoring the milieu. That it's useless as a term, since it
almost automatically assumes a while, most often male, etc. etc., striated
culture in the first place, the _avant_ necessitating a reification of the
rest. What happens is a certain exclusionary violence imho. It's a critic-
al move, no matter who applies the term.

Better to inscribe exfoliations of practices, sites of writings, sprays of
signifiers, instead of particulated emplacements - and at the same time to
acknowledge it was a highly problematic but common term, whose time has
past.

Phooey, what a way to have to start the morning: I have to call for the
execution of Hugh Steinberg.  His offense?  EGREGIOUS MISUSE OF MY TERM,
"OTHERSTREAM."

Actually, I set him up by incompletely defining otherstream poetry as
"any poetry that has never (to any serious extent) gotten into an
anthology of poetry published by a 'reputable' publisher--like
Norton--or been seriously discussed in a book of criticism published by
such a publisher..."  So I hereby redefine it as "any TECHNICALLY
DISTINCT VARIETY OF poetry that has never, etc., etc."  Visual poetry is
always my primary example, though Marjorie Perloff's course in it, and
what Harry Polkinhorn has been doing at San Diego State, and other
developments may be changing that.

I agree with Hugh that there are two (or more) streams of work that are
not widely accepted, but consider only one of them otherstream.  The
second "otherstream" he speaks of--"poems that are written out of a
general ignorance of institution based poems (poems written by people
who don't read poetry)"--is, for me, knownstream because it's not doing
anything technically new.  It's wannabe mainstream, or unsuccessful
mainstream, or left-behind mainstream, or overlooked mainstream (as I
believe Robert Frost was when Pound "discovered" him).

I just thought of a name for it: sundaystream poetry, or the poetry of
weekend poets--though it would also, unfairly, include the poetry of
people working seriously and full-time in mainstream poetry who simply
haven't done whatever is required besides writing good poetry to be
accepted by the establishment.  I did sundaystream poetry for a long
time myself so have nothing against it--and, with Hugh, am most
interested in how it is being affected by other poetries.  But puleeze
don't call it "otherstream."

This is Kevin Killian.  Today's the 60th birthday of the French poet
Anne-Marie Albiach and last night here in San Francisco was the Albiach
tribute organized by Dodie Bellamy and Small Press Traffic.  I was there,
in the theater space at New College, and I know you're all curious, how did
it turn out?

Successfully I think.  OK there were a few glitches here and there.  Kush
the marvelous videographer failed to show up, and earlier in the week Small
Press Traffic's office was rifled and the microphone stolen.  However a
tape recorder was available and thus Dodie can prove the event really did
take place, documentation being "everything."  Norma Cole began the evening
by sketching out some of the salient turns in Albiach's career and showed
us a double portrait.  One photo was of the young Albiach in 1969, a glamor
portrait a la George Hurrell on the occasion of the publication of "Etat."
We were all struck by how much she (AMA) resembled the young Katherine Ross
in Curtis Harrington's "Games."  Then another kind of portrait, Jean
Daive's imaginative portrait of AMA done solely through her punctuation.
Cole then read from Albiach's "Gradiva," and read part of AMA's translation
of Louis Zukoksky's "A"-9.  Barbara Guest rose and read what sounded like a
new poem, a "Reverie" for AMA.  Benjamin Hollander combined parts of two
previous essays to create an atmosphere, a theatrical atmosphere which
effectively illustrated what he called the "nocturnal" aspect of Albiach's
writing (and its effect on the reader).  Michael Palmer read an essay
reminiscing on visiting (or trying to pay a visit to) AMA in Paris, she
wasn't home, so, he said, the absence of the non-encounter lived up to the
highest expectations of both parties, and then he read "Five Easy Poems,"
dedicated to AMA.  Mary Margaret Sloan spoke briefly on the influence AMA
has had over the years on the work of North American woman poets, and read
from AMA's book "Mezza Voce."  Cole Swensen read from "'Vocative Figure.'"
Then everyone turned to the cake, the "gateau," and tore that sucker to
shreds (or crumbs, I suppose).  There was much mingling, wine, and etc., if
only Steve Carll were still on this list he could tell you all the names of
the poets and artists who attended.

I thought it would be a case of preaching to the converted but there were
many there who had apparently never heard of Albiach, and all the copies of
"Mezza Voce" were quickly sold out, attesting to the event's success as,
well, a kind of promotion for the glamorous, reclusive diva of
Neuilly-sur-Seine.  However not all were so easily persuaded and one famous
poet afterwards was overheard murmuring that she still disliked Albiach's
writing and what was all the fuss about anyhow.  This made me think of
Rachel Levitsky's post about when "the dominant obliterates the
marginal, the dominant will always assert itself"though I can't piece out
how it applies exactly.

Anyhow, thanks to all who worked on this event behind the scenes, in front
of the podium, in the audience, and thanks to all the US and Canadian poets
who signed the series of tacky Hallmark cards for AMA's birthday, which
were delivered to her ahead of time and which stunned and surprised her and
made her weep with this kind of absent French pleasure.

Subject:      Re: "*alternative*avant-garde" (fwd)

Despite its problematic status, I think it's a mistake to give up -- or to
concede -- the metaphor, "avant-garde."  In addition to the texts that have
already been mentioned over the last several days during the course of this
discussion, let me add 3 more -- the first 2, Hal Foster's "What's Neo about
the Neo-Avant-Garde?" and Benjamin Buchloh's "Theorizing the Avant-Garde" --
go a long way in rebutting the failures Peter Burger attributes to the post
WW2 avant-gardes.  The 3rd, Andrew Benjamin's *Art, Mimesis and the
Avant-Garde,* is an extremely interesting attempt at describing the
avant-garde in terms of what he calls the limit experiences of *the
as-yet-to-be-determined*.  Tradition, by contrast, is seen by Benjamin as a
repetition of a *determination made in advance* -- a legislative/regulative
function which posits a singular and recoverable inner meaning for works of
art.  Of course, Benjamin realizes that, while there is a dominant tradition,
tradition itself is not a univocal term since there are also differing and
marginal traditions. The point is that the traditional *intends* to be
univocal.  However Benjamin does not define the avant-garde merely in terms
of its resistance to tradition.  This would only retain the dominant
dichotomy.  But in an argument that is much too subtle to recapitulate here,
Benjamin conceives of the avant-garde art object as affirming an
"interpretive differential plurality."  In other words the avant-garde work
of art, like the avant-garde itself, is seen as  being in a continual and
inexhaustible state of *becoming.*  Benjamin writes:  "it is the capacity for
an experience of the as-yet-to-be-determined to generate reflection.
 Reflection, in this instance, will emerge at the limit of understanding --
in other words at that point where the percept, object of experience, etc.,
is such that it cannot be automatically assimilated to, and hence only
explicable within, the terms decreed by" tradition.  If none of this seems
convincing the fault is due to my simplistic summary -- but, in any case,
Benjamin's work seems to me to persuasively refute the idea that the
avant-garde has a "policing function."

Subject:      Re: "*alternative*avant-garde"

Though the term "avant-garde" can be misapplied, I still find it
of use. I think it's wrong to apply it to any movement
that's not broken with the mainstream and moved
poetry forward/outward in some important way. Language poetry
is/was avant-garde. ("Was avant-garde," if you believe it's run
its course and is now subsumed in the mainstream, has aged
to the point of being old hat, or was a literary dead-end--the
equivalent of the Neanderthal line in ape-human evolution.)

"Avant-garde" should not be applied to movements like
Slam Poetry or the New Formalism. The latter is a retrograde
poetry, though a little freer and less delimited relative to
subject matter than traditional verse had been.
The former, Slam, takes several known poetries--(1)
the socio-political rant and reportage (a Beat mainstay);
(2) the much older and ever-present sentimental poetry
of love, loss and tragedy; (3) the hyper-confessional and
edgy-comic strains of late eighties and nineties--and to these
Slam adds the dynamics of performance and competition.
An innovation, yes, but not really something I would consider
avant-garde.

To me "avant-garde" is certainly as useful a term as the others
proposed--i.e., alternative and otherstream. Neither of which strikes
me as getting to what "avant-garde" is when applied to writing.
"Postmodernist", a broader, more encompassing term, is certainly
even harder to pin down. New Formalism could be the literary equivalent
of Philip Johnson's Chippendale top to his ATT Building, therefore
NF could be a postmodernist movement. And "alternative" was
the New Wave, before Alternative became Modern Rock. (The music
media have their own troubles with "labels"--Is there a Postmodernist
Rock yet?) "Otherstream" is a nice coinage, but could as easily apply
to Slam as to Language writing, thus for me it's less useful.

"Experimental" is the term most often misused. Most experiments
are failures--steeped in the trial & error method. Most writers
worth their salt aren't publishing their "experiments." Rather they are
experimenting toward a new way of the writing, personally
or in the world. Once the work is published, the writer is, in general,
confident the experiment has resulted in a finished text that is achieving,
at least partially or in a way he/she could only dimly imagine, the
intended outcome of his/her initial experiments. The publishing
one's "experimental writing" is tantamount to publishing early drafts
and half-baked, alchemic concoctions of varying and lesser
consequence.

maria, hi!... thanx for your questions, time for me to delurk anyway!... to
employ some rather crude distinctions that i nonetheless find theoretically
useful:  i like to think through the questions you pose, re the avant-garde
and aesthetics, in two basic ways...

first, in terms of my own process as a writer:  sometimes---usually (to
date)---i imagine mself working/writing to construct a readership... that
is, the sorts of transformations i seek/anticipate/aspire for---in my
readers---i take to be primarily or largely a function of how they approach
reading my writing... the way they approach, that is, the alphabet as
such---the symbol-sharing experience that swapping same comprises (yes,
there is a utopian drift here)... and in many instances, i just don't think
the "they" exists as such!... it's not a claim i can prove, but it's useful
for me to imagine mself as contributing to an experience---over where you
are---that disrupts at times intelligibility, say...

i have of course worked in forms that seem to me to downplay this aspect of
the experience---that is, in which the so-called matter of "form" itself is
taken for granted, and in which "style" (please note quotes) replaces same
as a distinguishing characteristic... such, in my view, is one way of
beginning to think the discourse of scholars and scholarship in general
over and against the discourse of poets and poetry... though part of my
aim, as i understand my own work, has been to complicate this distinction;
when it comes to prose forms, such as the novel, the distinction may be
even fuzzier... yet i would say this distinction holds, even allowing for
the fact that there are poets *and* scholars who seek to complicate the
reading experience as such, and scholars *and* poets who seem to rely on an
already-understood experience (which is how i understand the
mainstream---again, not in terms of good or bad necessarily, but in terms
of popularity/demographix)...

the point here, in any case, is that work that challenges or speaks to the
reading experience (in terms, say, of the age-old form vs. content dualism)
is, in more popular AND often in academic terms, generally considered (and
critiqued/evaluated/dismissed/worshipped as) avant-garde or experimental or
radical or etc... ez to prove this, too---just TRY to get a trade press (or
an academic press) to pick up formally innovative work (and wrt to this
latter, pick your poison)... it ain't ez...

second, and here i think i'll be *really* idiosyncratic in my choice of
texts, is to think more in cultural studies terms, in terms of reception as
(as you suggest) a cultural-social process:  i'm reminded of that afterword
to pirsig's _zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance_, in which he
distinguishes twixt customary and what he calls "culture bearing books":

"a culture bearing book, like a mule, bears the culture on its back.  no
one should sit down to write one deliberately.  culture-bearing books occur
almost accidentally, like a sudden change in the stock market.  there are
books of high quality that are an important *part* of the culture, but that
is not the same.  they *are* a part of it.  they aren't carrying it
anywhere.  they may talk about insanity sympathetically, for example,
because that's the standard cultural attitude.  but they don't carry any
suggestion that insanity might be something other than sickness or
degeneracy."

i'm not wedded to pirsig's words, now---but if we allow that even "culture
bearing books" are a part of culture, and that there are in fact multiple
cultures, i think there's something in what pirsig is saying here that
might speak helpfully to the notion of contingency and history (he names
_uncle tom's cabin_ as a culture bearing book, but also says "it was no
literary masterpiece"---which latter is of course open to debate)...
provided of course we supplement same with the business aspects of the
writing marketplace etc...

so perhaps the matter of what is deemed avant-garde (term used advisedly)
turns at least in part on circumstances that are, properly speaking, beyond
anyone's control... ergo, the ex post facto nature of that discourse:
"this event turned out to be a seminal blah blah blah" (oh and i find this
latter useful too at times, but less when i'm in the process of writing
than when revising)... we may aspire to same, i mean, in our very process
as writers, we may lay claim to same (as i have at times) in our products,
but might this not comprise a requisite reach beyond one's grasp?... i.e.,
a failure?... even failure can produce some helpful effects, moods...

as far as hanging out with those what think like we do:  that's only human,
but past a certain point, it sure can prove limiting...

best,

joe

Two more installments of the monthly Impercipient Lecture Series (ILS) have
appeared since our initial announcement to the List in June.

Aldon L. Nielsen's "No Saints in Three Acts: On Stephen Jonas" should begin
appearing in mailboxes today.  Nielsen is among the first to give Jonas's work
the careful attention it both deserves and, in light of its fractured political
commitments, demands.  Great archival finds, including a powerful description
of the Baraka/Jonas correspondence, combined with Nielsen's signature ability
to practice a utopic form of close reading that models the desegregated mind
while acknowledging the still-segregated social body, makes this a must read.

Beth Anderson's "Imperturbable Things: On Still-Life Poetics" is a wonderfully
original meditation on the deceptive stillness at the heart of the
linguistic storm
in the work of Wallace Stevens, Barbara Guest, Marjorie Welish, Keith Waldrop,
Ann Lauterbach, and others.  Despite our canny release of this pamphlet in
June,
just as the blockbuster shown on Still Life got underway at New York's Museum
of Modern Art, a handful (literally) of copies are still available.

We've also recently done a small reprint of our inaugural issue, "The Dynamics
of Literary Change" by co-editor Steve Evans.  A fair number of our issue on
Bob Perelman's _The Marginalization of Poetry_ remain in supply.

The two back-issues that are unfortunately out of print at this time are:
1.2     Radical Dogberry and Society Sketches by Chris Stroffolino
1.3     The Ground is the Only Figure by Rosmarie Waldrop

Finally, to all the List-members who have shown support for the ILS through
contributions verbal and financial: Thank You!

The avant-garde border police are a boring phenomenon. nevertheless they are
not as boring, or harmful, as most of the phenomena they attempt to police.
we fool ourselves = a thought is (not) an action. get out your mla handbooks
o boy. given negation as a primary tactic of such arts it is no surprise that
a negation of the avant-garde is in the stirrups. nevertheless an explicit
passion remains possible. go give a damn. If you can.

Rachel, I appreciate yr response. I realize my response has a
'plague-on-all-their-houses' air to it, perhaps akin to donald's 'It's all
writing'. With me, this is due to an impatience with negotiating the space
between the work and the consumer. What is self-evident to the creator is
hardly so to potential readers, yet it's frustrating to take all the
guide-dog/hand-rail/sign-posted material one left out of the poetry for
esthetic cause, & have to recycle it as prose 'trot'/explanatory manifesti.
Perhaps one is more sensitive to this demand when one (as I) earned a
living for a quarter-century providing just such aid to those eagerly (or
perhaps not) seeking to get with the new in poetry. Au fond, it takes place
as an internal conflict, leastwise with me, a constant source of irritation
that leads me to dismissive gestures.

You are helpful with the suggestions of colleagues; Cole's intelligence &
patience are manifest in her reappropriation of 'marginal' so that it
places the writing she practices & whose practice she supports in others,
on a level playing field with 'maindrains' writing. Carla's 'hybridity'
strikes a chord with me--the local hero in sonoma county is Luther Burbank,
and for decades I've spoken to folks around here of the 'grafting' aspects
of the Modern. 'Making strange', your own candidate, makes sense too.

But ....but....  from a poet's p-o-v, it often comes to 'but not _my_ kind
of making strange', understandably, since 'making strange' can never be a
uniform endeavor. And 'not _my_ way of hybridizing' . The case of Michael
Palmer is worth considering here. As was pointed out by 6 poets
collaborating on an essay abt LangPo, Palmer had been in every 'LangPo'
collection and most journals devoted to publishing 'LangPo', so that his
disclaimer, in an i'view, 'I'm always a little outisde of the group, like
Matisse', had a bad-faith ring to it. His case gets more confusing when one
recalls that one of his books was touted by his publisher as being 'by the
leading Language Poet', and that it is declared by his translator in the
french edition of _Sun_ that Palmer 'never was a Language Poet.'

Whatever one thinks of Palmer's conduct of these negotations, one regrets,
for one's own sake, the necessity of them. I understand your point, Rachel,
about the 'dominant mode' more easily obliterating poetry not to its
liking, when that poetry fails to concert itself under some one stunning
rubric. Its a concern imposed by the dominant, it has one already speaking
the opporessor's language, yet it looks to be a dilemma of 'compromise
oneself or die'. To whom do you need to speak of yourself (since you use
this parallel) as 'lesbian'? Is it required in order to let men know not to
bother you, or in order to let others so inclined that you might be
available, or to qualify oneself for those few privileges that can come a
lesbian's way, or....? what is the necessity? Cab't the negotiations happen
on a one-on-one basis without recourse to labels, but instead by way of
declaration of taste and volition? I guess it can be seen as 'Strength in
numbers' and mutual support; as necessary assertion of pride in oneself in
the face of many who would shame one; as 'coming out' as courageous gesture
of commitment in a society still largely uncomprehending? I like your
analogy, and I think it bears further exploration as to parallels.

'Lesbian,' however, is a term whose currency is now well-established, and
so we are still left with the question, 'what is the name for what we
do--what claim to unity with others can we make that doesnt depreciate the
particular 'making-strange' it's one's destiny/fate/choice to have
incurred?' 'Not this', the first sentence of Silliman's poem, does lead, in
its case, to 'What then?' Ron's complex and active awareness of the needs
of the poetry-consumer in a society that offers brief, inadequate
explanations--but that _does_ offer explanations--for anything one might be
supposed to need to purchase, surely helped take him from sentence one to
sentence two. To have stopped with sentence one is an option I for one find
attractive. So that the 'What then?' is spoken, originates, in the reader,
with no further prompting from the poem.

That has the appearance of the idealistic in today's world, though, doesn't
it?

Well, this is long enough already, and coming to no resolution. I can only
hope that it nudges the discussion along a minim. Thanks, Rachel, for the
stimulus. David.

on a different note (altho the poem below cd be seen as 1870s avant-garde
now tres derriere...)

for those like me in late-summer doldrums wondering where the time flew,
perhaps a metaphor or two to tease out:

        In the month of the long decline of roses
        I, beholding the summer dead before me,
        Set my face to the sea and journeyed silent,
        Gazing eagerly where above the sea-mark
        Flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of lions
        Half divided the eyelids of the sunset;...
                        [swinburne, "hendecasyllabics"]

now we have flame above the sea-mark: presumably we are already to think
sun and/or sunset.  said flame's fierceness, fiercety?, likened to fervid
lioneyes.  now for the kicker: flame half divides eyelids.  hold on to
that for the moment, let's tend to these eyelids first.  eyelids of the
sunset: possesive or partitive genitive, the sunset /has/ eyelids or /is/
eyelids?  if the sun is the eye (as it has already been associated with
fervid lioneyes), then eyelids can be sky and earth, upper and lower
limits of vision, extinguishing the sun in the slow blink of its setting,
its setting under, its untergehen.

yet flame half divides
eyelids, divides them in
half, keeps them open.
even when closed they
are still divided,

by the horizon, or:
half divides as in
divides only partly,
not completely, half
divided half joined.

even tho i gaze
eagerly above
the sea-mark
the flame is so

fierce, as sky
and earth close
on the sun, i

have to squint,
join my eyelids
together, close
them enough so

that they are
still open.
to the horizon.

J Finnegan - I like your idea or description of experiment as something
that precedes publication.  Though exploratory work will always seem
experimental.

"Avant-garde" seems like a contradiction in terms.  Whenever the really
new has solidified to the point of being a lined-up advance in good order,
it's already crusted over.  Have it for lunch tomorrow.

Progress.  Sure it happens.  Sure there is the new.  Sure people grow off
each other's energy.  But why do you say the New Formalists are "freer"
than the plain old formalists?  Doesn't this betray rather a linear notion?

Close reading will turn a lot of old poetry into very avant-garde material.
Dante, acc'd to my old buddy Mandlestam, is a poet of the future.

The idea that tradition is univocal (not your idea, a different post), is
too abstract to mean anything. Look back in lit history & you see a conti-
nuous nervous fluctuation of attitudes, styles, etc.  "Every significant
movement in English poetry could be interpreted as a reaction to the political
situation." (Stephen Spender, 1940).

Another interesting Spender quote:  "Now the poet is someone who devotes
his life to exactly such a process of self-revelation as drama attempts to
produce in characters: his poems are speeches from the drama of the time
in which he is living."  (1938)

The avant-garde is that portion of the new which has been assured canonical
gluing into "the tradition".  Think about it. Maybe that's the answer to
Maria's question (paranoid though it may be tending toward...)

Just a quick blast - Aldon's extended essay on Jonas, which I was lucky
enough to be handed OUTSIDE the Harris collection on Prospect St., is
VERY good work & great reading.  He's done his homework & his
essay is remarkable for the number of issues it touches on (neglected
startling poet - Stephen Jonas; race relations & identity; style in
50s-60s experimental poetry; the visual/textual/WRITTEN as an overall
musical-sharpening tool in Jonas' work after Pound & Olson) -
WITHOUT getting lost in the minutiae or neglecting a considered
assessment of Jonas' achievemnts.

Way to go Aldon!  Now I have to look for that Talisman book of this guy
(Jonas - SELECTED POEMS, Talisman Hs 1994).

Jonas seems to have been an extremely witty writer lost in the fuzz of time.
Beautiful archival digging here.  Witty, highly musical, & violent sharp &
edgy.  But some of the edge seems to be sharpened/softened by his direct
application of blues & jazz in a very deliberate & extensive way.

Charles,
Cross your fingers, take the oath, take the money and remember that the
Declaration of Independence says that it's OK to seek the removal of a
government that won't guarantee your rights. That is, as long as you are
a property-owner. You do own property, right? Not to take your situation
too lightly, I think there are a number of "subversive" things you can do
in your small press class to more than offset this odious oath. Keeping
every promise can be a sign of rigidity.

best,
Steven

It sounds a little like McLuhan, who said that the avant garde artists do
not live in the future, but in the present, while evryone else lives in the
past.

See his essay called something like "The Rear View Mirror".

Curses on me, I've almost always found the opposite to be true - that the
avant-garde is often retrograde - at the same time everyone was praising
Godard's attack on the corporate (and binding women to the sex industry
vis-a-vis the gaze of the director), the same was occurring in hollywood
film after film.

Attacks on systems and classical logics, rationality, came from as varied
sources as Godel, Alexander Bryant Johnson, Vaihinger. Meanwhile avant-

Well, having heard some at a "festival" this weekend, I came up with a term
for the opposite kind of writing (I mean not avantgarde),. I dont know
whether the term has already been used, but I called what I heard "consumer
Poetry."

Here's what I cant figure out: would a subversive hesitate to sign the

Here's another thing i always used to wonder. Does yr US body called the

I'm wondering about being faithful to the Declaration of Independence. I
mean especially the part that says that King George III was a rotten guy
for not being the implacable enemy of the Native People of America.

George, HUAC changed its name to the House Internal Security Committee
in 1969 and was abolished in 1975 (after Watergate), although I think
somebody forgot to tell Gingrich, Helms and Buchanan.  There's a
hilarious chapter on the committee in Jessica Mitford's _A Fine Old
Conflict_ (which is out of print, unfortunately).  Among other
jollities, she reveals that HUAC, in one of its first actions, named
Shirley Temple (then nine) as an unwitting dupe of the Communists, and
later designated Christopher Marlowe as Un-American.

Hmmm, another person to execute: James Finnegan for saying that while he
thinks "Otherstream" a good coinage (thanks!), he believes it "could as
easily apply to Slam as to Language writing."  Wrong on both counts.
According to my definition, both Slam Poetry and Language Writing are
KNOWNSTREAM, the opposite of otherstream because they, or poetry in all
essential respects identical to it in the case of Slam Poetry, are in
the establishment press anthologies.  Slam Poetry is probably mainstream
(a substream of knownstream) as well; Language Writing is not.

And then there was Brecht's hilarious performance before the committee in
which he reminded them that he might, indeed, as a German, be unAmerican.

Apparently what you do when you're up late by yourself is confuse
categories. What's avant garde about Godard is and was his montage, not his
politics. Lots of us went to his films for instruction in the former, very
few for the latter.
Are you truly suggesting that only those who are in the vanguard in all
things are worthy? If your mathematicians had conventional table manners
and wrote elizabethan sonnets in secret would you dismiss them?
But to return to politics--artists of most stripes most of the time are
lousy predictors of the future (mathematicians, the writers of soap operas
and even technonerds are not notably more successful). Pound (whatever
avant garde meant, he qualified), fortunately, missed the boat politically.
Many of us learn from his innovations, but few from his politics.
Let's try this one: sometimes artists, no matter how progressive their art,
by the sheer luck of history, wind up clearing the path for an army that
most of us consider regressive. Wagner, who also was as avant garde as you
can get, became after his death the darling of the nazis, who liked his
politics, and there are probably more than a few lost souls who still seek
nourishment of that sort from him. But that's not why he remains for most
composers the most influential composer of the late nineteenth century, and
it's not why most of his audience goes to the opera.

This brings up an interesting point - to what extent are they separable?
For part of the politics of '68 that went into his work revolved around
the reification, self-reflexivity of the filmic process - and this has to
be somewhat centripetal, a site of all forms of contestation which are
interpenetrated.

Oh Heavens no! Seriously, please don't misunderstand. I'm hopefully not
making a value judgement, certainly not one on the basis of "vanguardism"
or "avantgardism" at all. My own reading is widespread; I'm just worrying
the category, and reacting to the notion that the "avantgarde" is somehow
culturally advanced - questioning the somehow.

I can't speak that well to Wagner, but I think in fact the pan-Germanism
of his work did speak, integrate well with imperialism - and for me,
listening relatively carefully at times (not within years however) to his
music, it is also a fanfare for, if not an ideology, at least an
ideological plateau - it's oddly programmatic.

We have had this debate before, and it's always a matter of degree - for
example, I like Heidegger a great deal, particularly his later work, in
spite of his Nazi affiliation.

In other words, I'm not arguing at all for purity in work, nor even for an
ulterior accountability, but again reacting to McLuhan's statement and
other texts which assume that an avant-garde _site,_ so to speak is also
the _site_ of somehow "advanced" thought - without deconstructing the
latter in terms of the culture at large.

Perhaps you are thinking of Australian poet Richard Tipping's road sign:

"Caution! There is no avant garde, only those who have been left behind."

Right you are. Self-declared avant gardes are sometimes anything but. The
corrective I offer is that artists like Godard, Wagner, Pound, are, indeed,
"the site of somehow 'advanced' thought," but that thought is to be found
in the process of the films, music and poetry themselves. In the case of
Wagner, who greatly extended the harmonic resources available to composers
and invented an astonishing new way to structure large works (based on the
repitition and combination of motifs--some polyphonic passages become
incredibly rich and complex metaphoric worlds), composers of all political
stripes have continued to learn from his music, notably Verdi, Mahler and
Schoenberg, who were not particularly sympathetic to his politics.

I want to add that I'm in agreement with you here. I do think it can be
difficult to separate one aspect of that thought from others, but I also
think it's absolutely necessary. One of the interesting aspects of wri-
ters like Celine, Pound, Heidegger, Dostoevksy, etc., for me, is that the
anti-semitism is pretty well buried, available elsewhere (for example
Marx's letters) but not necessarily played across the major texts. And I
don't believe in a contamination principle, that "bad-thought _here_"
need result in a loosening of rigour or value "_there._"

yeah, this reminds me tht there's a special provision for forgiveness on
yom kippur, for oaths made under threat of death or other such duress.
i.e. it was important that jews survive, even if it meant converting under
the threat of death; they could be forgiven as long as they remembered they
wre jewish.

avant garde? otherstream?
one of my impressions is being on the frontier, away from the center. doing
things with your art that you don't know of anyone else doing (yes there are
links back, 3rd cousins, you are what you eat, stained by the culture you're
steeped in.)
seems, from the usage so far in this discussion, that avant garde is kind of
a dividing line, beyond a certain pale. the acceptable/center continues to
evolve, to include poets who a century ago would not be tasteable by that
stream.
my longheld (& probably over optimistic) attitude is that good writers write
the way that connects with their beings. for some writers, this truespeak
happens to fit  the mode of most acceptable and that writer prospers wildly.
we are laying down our individual visions, a wide variety outside the pale
than within. some people get their voice right off; most of us going thru
phases of influence, getting our bearings, before the proper pitch begins to
unlock the stream/voice.
but its such a wide filed, this otherstream, the more important labels are
subdivisions--langpo, surrealism, etc., and all those riding rifts along the
ambiguous borders. to recognize the various channels along which poetry
receives/transmits and find those you can work best to open/expand your and
other consciousnesses.

My question is, is there anything in those documents you disagree with?
Would you choose not to uphold them? If so, signing would be a lie, right?
Do those documents imply that you cannot teach that Zukofsky was a Marxist
or that his "an impulse to action" poem is cribbed out of Marxist texts,
or the showing of those texts, for instance. I think not.

Personally, I took such an oath many years ago, and I meant every word of
it. Still do. Not waving a flag, just that I still have that oath.

I can't stand flags or war, and these documents do try to resolve problems
in bargaining instead of war. I'd feel even better about it if we had
gotten the ERA passed, though. I just want to say that swearing to uphold
such things as free speech and freedom of the press does not mean you have
to agree with the current administration.

Bob:

Although you seem particularly intent on policing your borders, I beg of
you not to shoot (I still have my whole life ahead of me, I promise to be
good, my parents would be overwrought with grief, etc. etc.).

Fine if you want to keep the term "otherstream" narrow.  I'll even use the
term sundaystream (though it is quite condescending).  But I think this
sundaystream of poetics is important and worth paying attention to,
especially within a discussion of avant-gardes.

Much of the definition of "real" and "phony" avant-gardes revolve around
issues of formal experimentation:  who is the most innovative.

I'd argue that this is not what avant-gardes are about, that innovativeness
is only a subset of the term.  The main purpose, the distinguishing feature
that separates the avant-garde from the experimental is the desire to
effect change in people, first in their view of the artistic or political
medium, and then, more deeply, in the perception and course of their lives.
Surrealism is a classic example.

The reason most people are reluctant to use the term avant-garde anymore is
a general lack of faith that poetry, particularly formally experimental
poetry, has the capacity to change people's lives (with the exception of a
few people here and there).  This is reasonable, as poetry isn't a mass
medium in the U.S.

There is a loophole in this despair.  I'm thinking of another model of
change, of two types of avant-gardes: an impatient and a patient
avant-garde.  The impatient wants big change NOW, a revolution.  From now
on, their manifestos read, everything shall be different.

I doubt that form of avant-garde is feasible in our time.

The patient avant-garde takes a long view.  Instead of fire, it is a seed,
working its way slowly over time, creating change gradually, sometimes
glacially, instead of immediately.  I believe that experiments in writing
can change the way people think and live, and that this patient idea of the
avant-garde has relevance.

The contested field of change in poetics is the sundaystream, as this is
where the most substantial effects of any avant-garde will be felt.  How
will ordinary people think about poetry?  If one is an avant-garde, the
answer to this question is their raison d'etre.

One of the things I find so promising about slam poetics has nothing to do
with form or even content but rather in presentation.  What slams and open
mikes are doing is transforming a fundamental axiom of sundaystream poetry,
that poetry is essentially a private act, meant not to be shared with
strangers.  It desires to move poetry from an individual experience of
reading and writing, to a more public sphere of performance and audience.
No, they are not the first to do this, or even the best at doing this, but
they are doing this, and it is fascinating to see the impact it has made on
the way people write and perceive poetry, art, and even larger issues.

By coincidence, Maria, there is an essay by Mikhail Epstein appearing
any day now in the Denver Quarterly on Yasusada and on the whole
question of an author's existence or non-existence as it relates to
poetic production! I understand it's also slated to appear, along
with an Epstein interview, in Il Nuovo Giornale de Poeti in
Italy.
By the way, the Asahi Shimbun article I mentioned did not appear on
August 6, as I was informed it would. I'll send a note if and when it
does, as there is an English language edition of the Asahi and they
have a web-site. Don't know if it will appear in English too, but
will post address if so.

Woo! 40 plus posts and pretty well all of it interesting...

<<"Experimental" is the term most often misused. Most experiments
are failures--steeped in the trial & error method. Most writers
worth their salt aren't publishing their "experiments." Rather they are
experimenting toward a new way of the writing, personally
or in the world. Once the work is published, the writer is, in general,
confident the experiment has resulted in a finished text that is achievin=
g,
at least partially or in a way he/she could only dimly imagine, the
intended outcome of his/her initial experiments. The publishing
one's "experimental writing" is tantamount to publishing early drafts
and half-baked, alchemic concoctions of varying and lesser
consequence.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

My Larousse indicates that avant-garde is, firstly, a military term
referring to those who prepare the ground (or water) for an attack by ground
or naval forces.  It has come to be used in a figurative sense to refer to
those who prefigure another era in thought, ie. idees d'avant-garde.

The word is of the feminine gender along with avant-premiere, avant-scene
and avant-veille and might be interestingly compared to avant-bec,
avant-coureur, avant-gout, avant-poste, avant-projet and avant-propos, all
of the masculine gender.

And, in it's original meaning, I believe that the military term would be
found in all languages around the world.  It exists in Thai: thap na (the
"h" in "thap" simply indicating an aspirated or hard "t" sound).  The term
is also used figuratively in the same way.

Interesting?

What Bataille calls "the misery of poetry" should inform why it is that we
don't see too much actual poetry on the poetics list (see Literature and
Evil). To turn unsatisfaction into a permanent object is a hefty job for the
ephemeral e-mail, which renders language into deletable scripts. Do eyes
scan the screen the same way that they read the page? And let's answer that

I for one welcome gb's return to the List from the sunshine shores of
Sechelt, having missed his wicked wit & wide wisdom. The "consumer" poetry
he heard there suggests another name for what one would write : inedible
poetry. It has indelible built into it. I was also shored up by his use of
the word "present," as in, I thought, "Present Poetry." For writing the
present -- re cognizing existence in light of the forward edge of history,
which _has_ an inescapable linearity -- surely is a common injunction, &
cause for avoiding older baffles, technically speaking. (Those baffles
which are precisely (or vaguely) what by gb's term extended, a
"consumerist" audience, would recognize the poetic by). Inedible, indeible:
I am thinking of those of Alan Jennifer Sondheim's poems which, while
coming from a tradition that owes its durability to human nature, the poem
of hopeless longing, do so in terms of a new technology, terms which often
elude my understanding, but which feel fresh, which experience always is,
until put into words.  David

I've gritted my teeth and signed the things, but I think you miss the point
by a few miles. These oaths are remnants of the red scares of the forties
thru sixties. For many of us they bring back a painful and scary time. And
they're not voluntary, unless you consider it voluntary to refuse
employment. Constrained speech is a violation of free speech.

Pete Landers has done something rather astonishing here.  I'm not sure
what exactly it is yet, but one thing he's done is show in an indirect way
the extent of the damage inflicted by the McCarthy era (echoed by the Nixon
era & re-echoed by the Reagan era).

A state college is part of the State.  Only a Helms (& perhaps a New Critic)
would assume that a State job teaching automatically jeopardizes political
and artistic freedom.

Or is it basically intellectual freedom that is at issue?  Should a loyalty
oath be extracted from people in the intellectual professions?  Or in any
profession?  Isn't it a sort of economic blackmail? Or at least a sign of
loose anarchic big brotherism? Or rampant federalism?  I think it has something
 to do with tax money.  Taxes are a downpayment on patriotism for some.
Loyalty oaths protect state funding for education.  If you're for state
funding and approve for the time being of the constitution (rather than
a completely different or no constitution) I agree with Pete why not sign.

Personally my experience is far closer to speaking on the phone, though I
can't take the computer to the toilet and can take the book, but if it is a
difficult book i like to 'set' myself up.  The computer imposes a specific
set up that is difficult to vary.  I don't find myself getting as lusty from
the screen as I do from the page, nor as sad.  Humor suits it (that's nice),
and that would support your use of Bataille.

David--thanks for the long, provocation.  About a month ago, Mahate
asked me what is a lesbian.  Umm, my response: "some _one_ who commits
sex in defiance of 'compulsory heterosexuality,' whose _main_ attraction
is for the female body."  In response to your question, I am personally
more interested in the word as it aids in defying rigid constraints on
sexuality than I am in hitting on women or keeping men away.  Also
important is community, if that's what you mean by few priviledges,
though nothing was worse than small city pot lucks where it is assumed
that you want to be around people simply because they are dykes!  The
variety of NYC a huge relief.  Back to my definition, I am less
interested in exluding unlike bodies, than I am in exluding those of
unlike committment.  Example, bi-sexuals who want to be in on the parade
and have a June wedding to boot.  Not that many homosexuals don't cream
in their pants at the idea of a wedding but if we are on political
ground, there is a hierarchy set up by the priviledging of marriage to
heterosexual pairings.  And political integrity would suggest you can't
sit in both positions at once.  I am interested in integrity.  In Tokyo
there is a group called Wanabes, females who live as males and work in
clubs where they are solicited by straight women.  One of the wanabes
interviewed in the documentary I saw (_Shinjuku Boys_,  Kim Longinotto,
Jana Williams) lived in a partnership with a transexual born male living
female, another wanabe had fallen in love with a client, a straight
woman.   Each couple seemed to be living their own category.  One wanabe
said "I've heard lesbians take off their clothes [in sex] but we wanabes
don't like to do that"
        Maybe this is making no point but to say we are always
redefining our terms.  You ask, "what is the name for what we do?" and
I'd say naming is what we do, and re-naming in good anarchist form.  I
would say that 'making-strange' can be a claim to unity in terms of
committment.  As when M. Damon invokes the(I should say 'a', not all
mid-westerners do this) mid-western meaning of the phrase "it's
different" (or Bernstein "Difference or/*differance*:it's/the
distinction between hauling junk and/removing rubbish, while/I needless
not to say, take/out the garbage".
        And the flip side to the committment of 'making strange' would
be translation, stretch, making communion, sorry for the slippage here.
        Perhaps there was more I wanted to say but ya, ya, enough, the
mire widens!  --Rachel

Much like the gateau, I thought the tribute was most delicious.  Being new
to San Francisco, it was a pleasure to finally meet Kevin Killian in the
flesh.  I spent much of the reading in the second row writing, combining
what I was hearing and thinking (I do this at most readings, though the
choice of row varies, using the material in my own work).  Anyhow, here's
the poem I wrote from that evening.

Two poems after listening to Anne-Marie Albiach


1.

he discerns her portrait in the punctuation from her book.  the type
of energy found in a spiral on a page.  response to different works.
the excavation of a story.  how it happened as an unfolding of
leaves.  as in spring or the manuscript as it becomes a book.  she
says pictures.  photographs.  points stretched in dark weight.  like
ink as it becomes words and punctuation.  as a torch in the glass of
night.  a mime of absence.  so it is in voice several times.  which
was written and revised until it no longer resembled speech.  a fall
or an answer.  to repeat each symbolic body until they are
numerous.  white stars in the evening sky.

2.

to live in steps.  by leaves in a book about to be printed.  in the
letters dead people write each spring.  light gathers in memory
where the pictures were lost.  consider how he was reading.  the
hour of things.  as equated values.  in labor or goods created.  to
count like knuckles.  words in fists.  in muscles which rest.  in the
absence of threat night slips in.  in the creation of darkness through
petty acts and great machines.  of broad and hopeless spaces.  a
promise which was discontinued.  as it is all the same.  ideas which
erase their erasers.  in time as it hurries.  like a transistor between
ghosts and he who is merciless.

Having read the Boston Review articles on Yasusada, I am saddened by the

scores of Asian poets who work in obscurity.  Whatever cynical motive

Charles Alexander: Sign the oath to secure the job and hope to
later have a fulfilling chance to violate the hell out of such a
Stalinist loyalty contract.

Pete Landers: Let's say just hypothetically that twenty years from
now after a few years of deep economic crisis and U.S troops
completely bogged down in the Amazon in Brazil that there is
discontent all over the place and the UPS workers start a strike and
its 1968 France all over again only this time there's an
upstart socialist leadership in the U.S. labor movement which is
class conscious and really pissed off and calls for nationwide
strikes with the idea that the country has been run for the
past two hundred and forty years largely for the pleasures of
capital and there's no need for that to go on any longer and
let's cut they say the military budget by nine-tenths and a big part
of U.S. labor responds and then in a panic a purportedly liberal
Democratic Party administration suspends habeus corpus and the
constitution and avant-garde poetry and everything else and declares
martial law outlawing all public activity by enemies of the United
States foreign or domestic. What say you Pete Landers about that
loyalty contract you meant every word of three decades back? Would
you turn in the elderly poet Charles Alexander if you suspected he
was a friend of the radical and national-security-threatening
AFL-CIO? Would you still uphold his right to freedom of speech? Even
his right to violate his loyalty oath in defense of freedom of speech
and the press (I'm talking for example about Charles Alexander
standing in front of a crowd of angry U of Arizona students and
urging them to defy government instituted martial law)?

Ok, this is all fanciful and maybe you'll say (I hope) yes to my last
question, but the truth is that there are loyalties and then there
are loyalties. Freedom of speech and the press is obviously wonderful
while we more or less have it ("more or less" because of little
publicized but longstanding spying and harrassment activities of
local and national government agencies against legal political
dissidents). But the McCarthyite loyalty oath you are so proud to
have signed does not speak to liberties of speech and the press that
are pure, inalienable, and free from historical contingency. It
speaks to their opposite--hidden, for now, as that opposite may be.

Kent's hypothesized fascist future reminded me that i wanted to post to the
list the solution to the "flying-saucer" confusion.

There are no such creatures as space aliens (except us).

USAF technology has included, since shortly after WW 2, the ability to use
the electro-magnetic field to suspend gravity. Flying machines that can
hover in place, or go very fast in any direction, that are silent, and that
carry weaponry of an electronic sort, highly sophisticated--can stall cars
from a distance--do exist.

The flying saucer space alien myth has been fostered by the USAF at certain
levels. To keep their technology secret. "Those arent our discs up there."
Now the myth is firmly established, they deny their belief in it. Sound
move.

And here's one possible application: "President Clinton today told the
american people that space aliens who can render themselves invisible via
their technology, now occupy the White House and have their space-weapons
trained on 15 major american cities.

'The carnage would be one hundred times that of Hiroshima or Nagasaki,' the
President declared, the gravity of his concern causing his voice to
tremble.'From this moment on, I am obliged to carry out whatever orders
these spacemen give me. I would be delinquent in my duty as your President,
to do otherwise.

'First, you must labor for less. These space creatures understand finance
and want to increase profits from industry of all kinds. Second, no one may
speak against my Administration.' The President continued with a list of
Alien demands, the text of which can be found on today's Page Three. There
will be a substantially different format to our newspaper starting
tomorrow."

as a footnote : this week's World News, along with the revelation of
Elvis's sexual impotence & fondness for fondling fourteen-year-olds,
carries the transcript of the last words (found on the Alien equivalent of
a black box), translated from Alienese!, of the crew of the space craft
doomed to crash at Roswell in 1947. I was interested to note that one of
them cried "God forgive me for my sins!" while another gasped "We cant
crash! My wife--my children--".

I find this reply astonishing.

David Israel's thoughts about the history of the imagination being
equally as important as the history of wars, power, etc. (and about
Eliade's mythic time as opposed to secular time) are one thing. I don't
agree with them either, but I understand that poets have and will
continue to explore these realms, and I think I also understand a little
about David's whimsy and style in general. I don't think there's
anything particularly "timeless" about either of these pursuits, David,
but that's another story, one, if you wish, we could pursue
back-channel. As Gibbon said, "To the people all religions were equally
true; to the philosophers all religions were equally false; and to the
state, all religions were equally useful."

But to say, as Judy Roitman does above, that the level of the sentence
is a good "innoculator" (sic) against "the bullshit causality that
proudly brings us Northern Ireland, Bosnia" et al is stunningly
wrong-headed, it seems to me. For one thing, is it even possible to
inoculate ourselves against such phenomena? Why would we wish to? Are we
really immune from such "stuff," here in the glorious non-Balkans? Has
it become impossible to learn from history? (She does have enough of a
knowledge, apparently, to state that Bosnia is not the only element of
"The Balkan problem," as it's been known for centuries; how did she
obtain that knowledge?) In fact, how does her attitude differ from my
beginning composition students who say they don't watch the news because
it's too depressing?

I agree with those who have said that the level of generality at which
these disputes are conducted is excessive. Perhaps we could look at
specific poems.

I also agree with Henry Trismegistus, who said a few posts back that
there's validity in both arguments, pro-history (ignorance of it leads
to stupidity) and anti-history (it just goes on and on). May the gods
protect us all from totalizing anything. But even if "history" IS a
nightmare from which we're all trying to awaken, as the mythic Stephen
said, don't we have to first realize that we're asleep?

And yes, Jordan -- some poetry IS "less than".

Hi folks

Is anyone out there working on links and comparisons
between the *textual practices/compositions* of
Derrida and any of the Language Writers? Does
anyone find one or the other a more austere or
less representational or more representational
or less austere practice? Derrida can seem to me
to be stylistically close to Stein, although he
more obviously pins his colours to Genet. Is
anyone doing working or thinking on Derrida as
a writer, the way we have recently been discussing
Clark Coolidge as a writer? The way a writing
experiment/ opening out a pun for example / opens
up a terrain? Does anyone feel as I do the desire
to rescue Derrida from those who want to snip up his
works into critical terms ( deconstruction, differance,
erasure) which they then re-plant in much more
conventional dull prose? (This is his complaint in
Glas, of how Sartre wants to pick the flowers out of
Genet's work and ignore Genet's composting and tending of
the land). Does anyone enjoy Derrida as a *writer*, as
much as they enjoy a Language Writer as a *writer*?

Unfortunately, not quite....You'd be surprised..Lots of casual statements,
prefaces, essays etc. by people in the otherstream use A-G, tho'
admittedly they use "experimental" and "innovative" a lot more..The
problem being how to make clear to a reasonable range of folks what area
of contemporary poetry practice one is talking about....A problem that
still ain't been resoved, certainly not by me.  I dislike a-g and
experimental the most, but "innovative" makes me uneasy too..

The idea of using "alternative" is interesting..Not one I'd noticed, as my
previous posts make clear..

I have a whole other set of problems with that, than I have with the
A-G/experimental/innovative triad...

It seems to me that "alternative" primarily valorizes the mainstream.  As
writing by Susan Howe and Clark Coolidge is very important to me, and
writing by (say) Stephen Dobyns and Tess Gallagher of almost no interest
whatsoever, it seems weird and hopelessly confusing to call the more
important work "alternative."  One of these groupings has more
institutional support thant the other (is more "acadominent," in fact);
but that really doesn't make it "primary" and the other "alternative."
Merely fatter, lazier and more overfed....

You should always use words in a way that reflects your own values and
judgments, and in that respect it seems to me that Howe and Coolidge are
primary, and many lionized mainstreamers a (very inadequate) alternative..

This is a real difficult one.  Loyalty oaths....

No they **NEVER** went away, not ever, and they have hung on in *many*
states.  I've held about 5 major library jobs so far in my work-life; the
only one where I was a full state employee (Cornell being a weird hybrid
of state and private) was at the University of Michigan, my first
after-college job.  That was in 1978, and yup there sure was a loyalty
oath just like this one you've quoted....

Needless to say such barbarism ought to fought in any way possible; the
rest of the world sees these things (rightly) as an exceptionally insane
instance of U.S. right-wing dementia....

But for most of us, refusing is not one of the ways possible.  I signed, I
hardly had any choice did I?  I've always been working-class, and poor,
and there weren't any other jobs available that were going to keep a roof
over my head.  During the next four years, I helped build the left in
Michigan and at the U. of M. in many different ways, including working on
a clericals organizing drive that came within a few votes of winning (in a
situation where the UAW had been de-certified a few years before, and
getting a union in was thought to be impossible..)

It seems to me you fight where you can, and where you can win.  If you
have the slightest chance of surviving while fighting the loyalty oath, by
all means go for it....But I'm one life-long socialist who signed.

Hello everyone on Poetics List, this is Kevin Killian.  Please help me if
you can!  In connection with my upcoming biography of Jack Spicer, I have
to secure permission to reprint unpublished material by the following
writers:

Alfred Bester, e.e. cummings, Denise Levertov, Dorothy Livesay, Robert
Lowell, Marianne Moore, Frank O'Hara.

Can anyone clue me in about, what are the names and addresses of the
literary executors of these estates?

Some of you must have had similar problems, how did you handle them?
Please back channel me, I don't know who else to turn to, had no idea
modernism was so difficult!  Thanks---

maria, that really IS banal...

mebbe some of the more acclaimed poets out there who rail against emedia
should spend a little time getting their feet wet in same (not that the
radio or tv, say, are UNelectronic devices---i think some may have
forgotten that these items are plugged in too)... personally, i think the
resistance given voice to (by nobel-laureate poets, for example) to things
electronic reflects their having intuited that the earth is moving
under their feet...

I don't quite know who your "reasonable range" might include, but what you
propose, making CLEAR to people who will not automatically know about the
variety of practices out there, what it is one is talking about -- is
admirable, is a constant challenge, and is damn near impossible. This is a
challenge for all the presses here which write grant proposals, as often,
particularly on local panels, we are judged by people who have a very
limited sense of the poetry out there -- they are likely to know something
about Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, Maya Angelou, perhaps a few local
writers, a smattering of pre-1950's poetry (Frost, Sandburg, some
Victorian, some Romantic, back to Shakespeare), and not a lot more. How to
describe "otherstream" or "language" or "post-objectivist" or other such
poetries to these people (and these are people who by and large are open
and want to understand; and they may also be taken to stand for numerous
folks we'd like to get to buy our books and come to our readings), to
describe in a way that they know what such poetries are and what they are
not, yet without requiring them to read more than a few paragraphs of
narrative and perhaps a page of examples, is a fairly amazing task. I don't
know anyone who has mastered it.

I stand corrected in misapplication of your "otherstream." But
I must now correct you on the point that Slam Poetry is mainstream.
Having sat thru the four hour '97 Slam National Finals last night, I can tell

you there was nothing like a Merwin, Rich, Ashbery, Gluck, Tate, et al,
in the house. There was much loud & light verse, the sentimental &
the insentient, the raucous & rimed, the goodspirited and godforsaken,
the crude & the cute. All in all, despite a numbing length akin to the
Academy Awards ceremony, it was a great show. One could argue abt the
literary quality of some of the poems (scripts), but the performance level
was firstrate.

Slam, as I said, is not "avant-garde" in terms of writing. However, Slam is
nothing one could/should mistake for contemporary mainstream poetry.

BTW, The Boogie Man from Cleveland OH won the Individual '97 National
Slam Championship, with D.J. Renegage of Washington DC runner up.

The Team Championship was won by Mouth Almighty (Taylor Mali, Beau Sia,
Reggie Cabico, and Evert Eden); best of the 36 competing teams. Los Angeles
was second, Cleveland third.

Incidentally, Henry Taylor, Pulitzer Prize winning poet for his book The
Flying
Change, did enter as an individual. He didn't even make it to the semi-final
round.

Oooh, Maria . . . this is an attitude I find all the time in the book arts,
where artists and audience want to see the arts of making books by hand as
opposed to the technological/information age -- holding up the value of
work made by hand over the value of work made by machine, or virtual stuff,
etc. It's really an unimaginative attitude, to me insulting to work which
might fall on either side of an opposition which is false and harmful.

and yes, I think I even heard, sometime last week, someone quote that
phrase about poetry as a "momentary stay against confusion." confusion, of
course, being basically anything the person who says such a phrase doesn't
like.

Rob --

It's self-protecting, the urge not to post poems the people who don't post
poems feel. Do poems feel this way? Texture farming. Miracle gro. The
environment rejects "the last best offer".

What's more amazing to me though is the policing of what's permissible in
these not-poems. And the will to clarity here. Why not drop the team names
and go out and play? Because it's big business, complete with free agents,
concession stands, licensing deals. Suggestion for new name for avant-garde
poetry: poetry.

dear ira:

i wrote an essay about 10 years ago comparing Steve McCaffery's
notion of "General Economy" to JD's theory of writing (grammatology); it
was published in the toronto-based Open Letter issue devoted to Steve's
work. This piece centered less on the textual comparison's between the
two in favor a comparison of theoretical positions. As i recall it,
mccaffery's privileging (yup, that's the word i used) of the "excess," the

Uh, Denise Levertov is probably still in charge of her own estate, as she's
not dead yet.  When I'm back in Seattle tonight I'll check to see if she's
listed in the phone book (though someone else on the list may have a way to
contact her).

Subject:      when you do your own policing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I'm arriving a little late on this one, but I want to second lb
drake's response to Maria Damon's several questions about policing in the
avant garde.

        I must confess to great boredom over the struggle to define the
meaning of the term "avant garde." I think of Wittgenstein: "isn't the
value of a word precisely in the looseness of its definition?" The value
of avant garde as a term is what the term can be turned to mean by those
various groups and individuals interested in using it or getting rid of
it, a meaning that
CANNOT be final as long as anyone thinks redefinitions of it (or even old
definitions of it) can be made to seem worthwhile to them in whatever
they're doing. Make it seem something interesting, or not--it's your word
if you want it.

        But the problem, I feel, especially with the second of Maria's
posts is that there is a fairly intense confusion of contexts of
disciplinary power. I certainly understand that Maria's comments
were not meant as final conclusions, but as queries. So I don't want my
comments to be seen as criticisms so much of her as of these particular
comments, because I think these comments reflect positions that are, in
fact, dangerously common.

        Maria asks whether the avant garde polices its borders? And people
respond "well what is the avant garde?" and people respond, as I would,
well sometimes yes and sometimes no, it depends on the context, the
publication, the personalities, etc. But then she offers, AS AN EXAMPLE OF
AVANT GARDE POLICING, TWO EXAMPLES OF THE AVANT GARDE BEING POLICED BY
INDIVIDUALS WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS. The confusion
is important, because I think there's something significant at stake.

        I find, in
the details of these examples, a number of interesting problems. What does
academic "cultural studies" have to do with avant garde writing practices?
Why is there no mention of whether she tried publishing her piece on young
urban black poets in contexts other than officially sanctioned academic
projects? To whom does any value accrue if an article on young black urban
poets is published in an academic collection? To speak most broadly, I'm
concerned here that there is a large gap between what Maria's comments
suggest is at stake ("the avant garde police") in her experiences, and
what else, unmentioned, also seems at stake in those experiences.

        I find it hard to make my own use of the term "avant garde"
flexible enough to include an academic critic with a self-described
focus in "cultural studies" who decides to do a book "on a relatively
traditional sense of avant garde" as in any sense BEING avant garde. But
in any case, it seems clear that the "policing" context to which Maria
refers is the policing of the ACADEMIC context, with whatever relation to
avant garde practices. And the question for me then becomes "well how is
it possible that someone can have their essay turned down by an editor in
the academic marketplace and then decide that the fault might lie with
avant garde writers," writers who for all I know HAVE NO
WRITING APPEARING in the collections Maria mentions.

        Besides, are we really sure that magazines like CHAIN, TALISMAN,
WITZ and others would have no interest in publishing Maria's more "daring"
piece? Have they even been tried? And I can't help thinking that the
problem REALLY is that they haven't been tried because publishing an essay
in a magazine like that does NOT forward anybody's academic career, so
that perhaps it never occured to Maria that there would be any "value" in
publishing there in the first place. And if that is an assumption about
her concerns that I CANNOT make, at least I can ask her to try those
publications because the academic "value" of publishing her piece is NOT
the point--the point is having the piece published in a place where it
will be read.


        I think I wouldn't be spending so much time on this subject if it
didn't seem to me at the heart of a problem that seems to haunt this list
of late. That problem is this: WHAT IS THE RELATION BETWEEN ACADEMIC
PRACTICE AND THE VARIOUS TYPES OF "INNOVATIVE" WRITING PRACTICES THAT WE
MAY OR MAY NOT WANT TO LABEL "AVANT GARDE"? And I feel, in fact, that I'm
still seeing a great deal of confusion on the subject.

        I take the following to be my two basic assumptions: 1) We live in
a disciplinary society whose REAL operations of power work from the top on
down, but which also work often because of the unwitting participation of
those who might be opposed to such operations if they knew they were
involved in them. 2) That one of the main problems of a discplinary
society (others too I suppose, but I've never been in them) is that THE
SELF-INTEREST OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS IN THAT DISCIPLINARY SOCIETY OFTEN
BLINDS THEM TO THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THEIR OWN POSITION IN THAT SOCIETY.

        Pierre Bourdieu, as many of you certainly know, has in a book like
HOMO ACADEMICUS already made it clear that institutional criticism of any
kind can ONLY have value when the institutional critic has accurately
diagnosed his or her position in the institutional framework. If you don't
know who you are, then you can't know other people.

        In looking at a number of ideas floating around the list lately,
it seems to me that one of the problems that comes from insufficient
awareness about one's own social position is THE TENDENCY TO BLAME THE
PERSON WHOM YOU PERCEIVE AS ONE STEP ABOVE YOU IN THE SYSTEM, accompanied
by an exaggerated sense of that person's power which goes hand in hand
with an ignoring of the larger framework. In her post (again, which I
don't take as her final position) Maria blames an academic editor, who she
misconstrues as "avant garde," but never addresses the contradictions of
her own existence in the academic context. But there have been other
recent examples: language poets are "academically dominant" because a FEW
of them have more academic authority than other poets, and a some of them
have made it into anthologies that other people have NOT made it into. A
real advantage? Well, perhaps yes, assuming that more than a few people in
an academic system of some thousands teach such work at all. But isn't
there someone higher up to take on than the 100 people in academic
positions who just might have potential affinity with what you do?

        There are a myriad of possible takes on whether "avant garde"
activity can have any real place in the (currently disciplinary and
standardizing) environment of the literary academy. I take recent writing
by Tom Mandel and Ron Silliman to be saying no, such a place is not
possible at all. Because I like teaching, and because someone has to teach
people about poetry at some point, and because I'd rather it be me than,
say, J.D. McClatchey, I think some intervention is possible, especially on
the level of teaching. When it  comes to academic publishing, the question
seems whether publishing in the standardized form of the academic
marketplace can further the concerns of "avant garde" writing and writers?
I'm tempted to say no, but also tempted to say that, at times, a few
standard academic articles and books pointing in the direction of less
standardized work may help bring attention to such poetries.

        OF COURSE avant garde writers do some level of policing; the U.S.
is a country in which, with the occasional exception, the only way to make
a living at all is to police somebody. If you've got a way out of that,
great. If like Maria, you probably don't, perhaps the best you can do is
IN THE ACT OF POLICING TO MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT YOU ARE POLICING AND IN SO
DOING CALL YOUR OWN POLICING INTO QUESTION, AND BE CLEAR AT ALL TIMES THAT
YOU LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHICH IS FORCING YOU TO POLICE. Perhaps you would
not be policing otherwise, right? I mean, who knows? In another place,
Maria might be able to write the way she wants to write, on the subjects
she wants to write about, and be granted the right to make a living
simultaneously. And so would everybody else, whether they thought of
themselves as critics, poets, or whatever. What a cool concept!--too bad
it's not in the works.

        But until then, constant vigilance about one's own positioning in
the disciplinary framework seems to me crucial to saying anything about
poetry or anything else.

        Speaking to you, currently, as an adjunct who publishes books of
poetry and articles in non-academically authorized journals and who still
thinks he can do a better job teaching than most of the academic critics
who get better teaching jobs because they publish in academic journals
(present company all excluded, of course), and who also, sometimes, tries
to publish critical pieces about innovative writing in academic journals
but usually fails because he either doesn't want to do it the right way,
or can't, or just hasn't figured out how best the problem can be solved,
save by getting other people to change their minds--

That "mainstream" stuff--I tend to shorthand it as "New Yorker Poetry" or
"Iowa School." Not completely accurate, but you get the idea.

Very worthwhile for other writers and writing students. Extremely useful
for critics and scholars. Readers, if a litmag/book/website has these
beyond a population of other writers and literati, may be less taken with
this enterprise.

Obviously my assertion (re experimental) is flawed in that it's biased toward

"the end product." If a writer cares not a wit for "the done-thing," then all

his/her writing may be "experimental" to some degree. Though the word
will always carry with it a connotation of moving toward some endpoint--
yes/no, success/failure. (What is the right word to describe writing that's
not vested in any qualitative endpoint? Playful, random--most descriptives
seem too light or dismissive.) When the writing stops, as it must
somewhere/time, even if this end occurs only upon the writer's death,
or though a work is published as an "experiment" or "from Work In Progress,"
there is this tendency to assess and to judge.

I agree with Layne Russell that Mark Wallace's recent posting was a gem. It
prompts me to make two small points, not quite related to his, that I hope
may be relevant anyway:

First, 'professionally speaking', I myself work in the intellectual
backwater otherwise known as "Vedic studies" -- rooted in 19th cent.
philology, comparative linguistics, etc. -- *way* out of date. Vedicists
are probably even more conservative than your standard average Classicist
doing Greek or Latin [really!]. So what could we have to say about the
avant garde?

Well, an interesting observation was made quite a while ago by a French
Vedicist [one of the best ever], Louis Renou. In an overview of the state
of the art, circa the 50's, he suggested that the notoriously obscure &
often unintelligible poetry of the Rigveda had been made somewhat more
accessible *as a result of our increasing familiarity with avant garde
poetries of the 20th century*! His point was that such poetries had somehow
managed to loosen the grip of classical Euro- syntax and logic on our minds
so that we had become more capable of hearing the *very old* again on its
own terms, instead of trying to read it according to our own logic.

Another Sanskritist once commented, after reading Renou's translations of
the Rigveda into French, that they reminded him of Cocteau's film _Orpheus_
[I think the film has been mentioned on the list recently?], in which that
arch-poet Orpheus receives poetic transmissions over a car radio: Renou's
translations seemed to him like a similar sort of weird 'transmission.'

Whatever the avant garde is, *this* seems to me to be one of its important
functions.

Second, 'speaking professionally' again, I teach one of those standard
"intro. to world lit" courses, but since this one is targeted at art school
students I've had the opportunity to dwell on terms like "modernism",
"post-modernism", and yes "avant-garde". My experience is that students are
not very familiar with such terms and they need very *basic* help with
them.

I have to confess that I tend to characterize the notion 'avant garde' as a
'modernist' notion, rather than a 'post-modernist' one. That is, I suggest
to my students that the notion 'avant garde' is rooted in a particular
historical period, and I *ask them*: do you relate to this notion? And they
tend to say 'no way -- it's arrogant bullshit!!'  My students tend to be
post-post-modernist.

Have I been misinforming my students?

George

I am wasting more space -- but this response seems small to me. If you
don't like Rebecca and Maria presenting a different point of view, Kent,
say so and say why -- but please don't resort to what seems like a nasty
defensiveness.  Most people here obviously are interested in the Yasusada
affair, as it's remained a topic of the list off and on for quite some
time. But those who wish it wasn't such a topic, I think, should be welcome
to say so. It doesn't sound like preaching to me, despite the amen.

James--I think that publishing drafts, experimentations is an excellent
idea and only boring for reader when it is impossible to read or make
sense of.  Ther are some examples.  Lungful Magazine( Brendan Lorber), I
believe, has this as part of the format.  Audre Lorde published revised
editions of poems that had already been published in the volume
_Undersong_--which is an experiment that includes the reader.
Especially as folks who are experimenting form, the question of how we
arrive is highly pertinent, and when it's finished does it really feel
finished, or to quote someone I'm not sure who, temporarily abandoned.
Personally, I've seen finished poems become very different vis a vis
size, form, shape--especially if I give them enough time.

Here's one that is half the size of it's original, which was read and
submitted in it's original form and still changing it's form:

But Charles, I didn't say I objected to Maria and Rebecca presenting
their point of view. Not at all! What I was responding to is their
policing call to close down discussion on a topic which, I
agree, is obviously of great interest to poets on this list and well
beyond. Of course Maria and Rebecca are free to call for
silence around anything they want, but I can point out too, can't I,
that such a call is silly in the extreme, and thick with unintended
irony, given Maria's own comments the other day about the
"avant-garde" openly and subliminally policing its borders. And after
all, since no one else felt the need to answer these censorial
gestures, well... I mean, you can hardly blame me for speaking up!

Now will David Bromige please jump in and say something funny so
we can all be friends again?

Rewrite of Louis Untermeyer's, "Any City" (The Masses, July 1913)


Any City


Down each shuddered thoroughfare,
 She takes her nightly walk;
Exhausted, she is hardly there -
 They watch her like a hawk.

She transforms into thing of flesh,
 Despised by men - desired;
Those selfsame men who would enmesh
 Her soul, have nothing sired.

No female grace or charm or wile,
 No beauty, sense of power;
She offers a pathetic smile
 That lasts a useless hour.

The street has seen her come, and go;
 It offers nothing real,
And she is hard, and won't forgo
 Diamonds, wine, a meal.

Like Sleazy, she's a walkabout,
 A cutup who's been cut -
Don't waste your time, don't twist and shout,
 She's really in a rut.

She's twenty-threed, she's skidooed too,
 She's got it, oh you kid,
The lies, the thefts, she's in a stew -
 Take pity, smoke a lid.

The question was asked if someone should sign that they swear to uphold

his First Amendment rights even as he teaches and I said yes, sign.

I will defend the Constitution, if you want. Not here. I think it's a
good document on which to base a government, especially when you add in
those amendments. I think it would be hard to put through today. The
first ten amendments, for instance, would never be accepted by the
voters in present day America.

a school of genetic criticism or critique genetique emerging out of france
has been getting some notice lately (see /yale french studies/ 89, 1996,
special issue called "drafts," esp. laurent jenny's overview "genetic
criticism and its myths").  from a compositional standpoint the stuff can
be pretty fascinating and also show what we can really learn from, say,
joyce's finnegans wake notebooks.  or michelle leggot's book on zukofsky's

Isn't this the same clear thinker who says taking an oath to defend the
Constitution means turning in my colleagues if they speak out against a
gov't that suspends the Constitution? What is he objecting to now?

Ah! censorship. Well, thank you Mr. Whatchamacallit, or whomever.
Somehow I was confused. I thought calling a review a waste of space was
free speech, not censorship. Thanks for keeping an eye peeled for my 1st
Amendment rights!   ;-)

"Nevertheless, It Moves"
.
          a.
It is better that a few men suffer,
wrote Nicolo, to keep the laws
than that all suffer without laws.
     And Alcibiades
     emasculated 1,000 men
     on the Isle of Delos.
          And Alcibiades
          emasculated a statue of Apollo
          in Athens.
     And young men were castrated by the thousands
     in Italy
     for the hope of one good singing voice.
.
The assumption is
that without laws
men will suffer.
The major premise is
  saved for last
    and treated as a conclusion.
      The conclusion is stated
        first by Shuang Ti,
and Confucious was nearly obliterated.
        the major premise
      burns
    under the torches of Gregory Nazienen,
  Cromwell, Fallwell and
Mao Tse Tung.
Fire at the forges
  heating iron
    searing flesh
to close the wound of castration.
.
.
          b.
There is power for the castrato,
    The book burning zealot,
        the futurist.
    It is megavoltage
        searing the flesh
        causing spasms in the arms and legs.
    It is severing the spinal cord
        at the base of the cortex
        causing spasms in the arms and legs.
    It is strangulation of the esophagus,
        constriction of the jugular,
        oxygen deprivation,
        causing spasms in the arms and legs.
    It is the smooth power
        the smooth between the legs
            power of emptiness.
.
                History
        is a trail of blood on the stairs,
            the perfect crime,
    a crime of passion,
and the M.O. is clear
             though the water is fouled.
    You could distill that water
        ten kotis of kalpas
but it would never test clean.
    It would taste like the death of souls
             shuffling around
        a stagnant pit
fetid from the fluids of hecatombs.
1,000 cattle slaughtered for Athena
        the first with horns of gold,
    as many men, castrated,
            for refusing to pay a tax.
.
.
          c.
        I am not a citizen
    of this world!
Even its fantasies are tainted, spotted
    refelections in an exagerrated mirror
            where crimes
            are more heinous,
        and beauty
        more unattainable,
                and love
                and lovers
    either swoon in stupified naivete
    or fail beyond hope of intellible sentiment.
.
Fire can not purge this sorrow
    though this page can be destroyed.
  The abbey smolders after the rievers
        or the library
        under St. Gregory's fanatical eye.
            Is it Raphael who
            depicts him
smashing his miter in the heretic's face?
        We couldn't look at that painting
        knowing he had burned Sappho.
        (yolu raktido adu melestera)
.
    The hate on his face!
His god killed the eldest sons of the Egyptians
        for their father's crimes;
His god sent a bear to rend three children
        for laughing at a prophet's baldness;
    took converts at swordpoint;
    converts at the burning stake
        and burned them anyway.
    Hatooey said, "This heaven you say
            "I will go to if I'm baptised,
            "are these christians all going there?
            "I want to go to the other place."

                it moves!

The incipient totalitarianism you outline -- "the unwitting participation of
those who might be opposed to such operations if they knew they were
involved in them" -- renders Maria's later urdesire in your text -- "Maria
might be able to write the way she wants to write" -- an impotent fantasy.
These notions have strange bedfellows, as you'll recall that Republicanism
is dependent upon the notion that the masses don't know what's good (or bad)
for them and therefore need an elite, ruling class to make the decisions, or
in the case you describe, play the part of the enlightened artisan, who is
only one step away from being a slave as long as he is true to himself, what
defines this truth is a magical idea of a will not to police, but also to be
able to change other people's minds. Not to mention that this whole tack is
somehow nostalgic -- all theoretical demands that transcend labor's demands,
aim at a reappropriation of the labor process in the shadow of the
disciplinary society you describe. Meanwhile, Maria's desublimation is
mystified into a cynical confession where she might break free if she tells
the truth and writes the way she wants to write.

Despite my complaints, you do make some strong moves here towards a much
needed critique of the political economy of writing. Not an easy topic.

David was busy tonight giving a reading with Dan Featherston of
Tuscon...a cozy, intimate affair in the back room of a Santa Rosa coffee
house called Higher Grounds, home of the Russian River Writers Guild
readings for some time.  (David read some wonders retrieved from email
and lists...and some of his poetry of course.  Both David and Dan gave

Alright, Pete, try these out. Oaths, like all texts, have contexts. US
loyalty oaths come out of the context of repression and stink, for many of
us, of their history, regardless of the actual words. The assumption seems
to have been either that the poor traitor confronted with such an oath as a
condition of employment would recoil in horror, like a vampire confronted
with garlic, or would succumb to a necessity that would seem a humiliation
and in the process be humbled to the trace (if not, the imagining of such
humiliation would at least gladden the heart of the oath's proponents). The
actual texts of these oaths are rarely as innocuous as merely defense of
the constitution, but even when they are they resemble closely the oaths
administered to police, military, and office holders, all of whom are seen
as servants of and subserviant to the state. Metaphorically, a teacher who
has to sign such an oath is being told that he, too, is such a servant. And
then there's the issue that even if I fully agree with an oath the fact
that I have to sign it is a violation of my freedom of speech and thought.

A similar instance is our wonderful pledge of allegiance, as I remember a
late 19th century document. A loyalty oath for little kids. Sometime during
Eisenhower's administration the words "under God" were added. I was a
student at a Yeshiva at the time. We all resented this amendment. To the
orthodox among us saying the word God is a form of heresy. The rest of us
knew damn well that the God in question wasn't the one we prayed to.

It wasn't hard for little kids in Brooklyn to be so politically hip back
then; in the wake of the holocaust and the bomb it was a little harder to
leave one's brain outside the classroom door. And, of course, television
had entered our lives just in time for us to catch the daily installments
of our favorite after-school soap opera, the Army-McCarthy hearings. We
most of us had a pretty strong sense that whatever we owed allegiance to (a
term out of feudalism, for christ's sake) it wasn't Republic or Flag, and
that pledge was a daily rubbing of salt into the wounds.

It also smacks of various modern totalitarianisms, in which the individual
is defined primarily as a "citizen." For a while it worked for Robespierre.

But maybe I'm just being silly. Maybe these documents are uniquely sacred
and should be immune to deconstruction. And hey, I live in San Diego--most
of my neighbors would probably agree with you.

Thanks for all the posts regarding the loyalty oath. I suppose I can
interpret "defending against the enemy" as defending against the government
itself if I come to see them as the enemy. I wish it were just supporting
the bill of rights, the constitution, etc. -- but it's all of those laws,
many of which I don't support, but I guess I will just grin, sign, & bear
it, and go about the biz of trying to get students to think for themselves,
imagine their own loyalties.

that account, he's gonna mess it up anyway.
She says, he can't help it, he's too insecure, too needy, too fucked up.
J says, if he wasn't fucked up, he couldn't write, but yeah, I wouldn't
want to be in his shoes.
She says, he'll be back, I'm sure he'll be back.

Mr. Pete, this is the last I'll say on it too - but I was on your side.
I meant it was astonishing in the context of list-assumptions it was a

one word is a waste of space, compared to the hundreds that have been spent

Mark Weiss--

Very nice and eloquent post on loyalty oaths and pledges of allergy..

As these are among the most vicious and ugly misuses of language known,
they are very very much an important topic for the poetix list, I'd say
(--even apart from the original dilemma of a list member, which started
the thread).

david i,

re: yr questions abt the history of the term/concept, matei calinescu has
a useful take on this in his book "faces of modernity" (or perhaps "five
faces of modernity," it was published first under one title and again
under the other,  duke up 1991 i think). if i had the blasted thing here
i would save you the trouble and type out / summarize the relevant points.

on a different note (altho the poem below cd be seen as 1870s avant-garde
now tres derriere...)

for those like me in late-summer doldrums wondering where the time flew,
perhaps a metaphor or two to tease out:

        In the month of the long decline of roses
        I, beholding the summer dead before me,
        Set my face to the sea and journeyed silent,
        Gazing eagerly where above the sea-mark
        Flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of lions
        Half divided the eyelids of the sunset;...
                        [swinburne, "hendecasyllabics"]

now we have flame above the sea-mark: presumably we are already to think
sun and/or sunset.  said flame's fierceness, fiercety?, likened to fervid
lioneyes.  now for the kicker: flame half divides eyelids.  hold on to
that for the moment, let's tend to these eyelids first.  eyelids of the
sunset: possesive or partitive genitive, the sunset /has/ eyelids or /is/
eyelids?  if the sun is the eye (as it has already been associated with
fervid lioneyes), then eyelids can be sky and earth, upper and lower
limits of vision, extinguishing the sun in the slow blink of its setting,
its setting under, its untergehen.

yet flame half divides
eyelids, divides them in
half, keeps them open.
even when closed they
are still divided,

by the horizon, or:
half divides as in
divides only partly,
not completely, half
divided half joined.

even tho i gaze
eagerly above
the sea-mark
the flame is so

fierce, as sky
and earth close
on the sun, i

have to squint,
join my eyelids
together, close
them enough so

that they are
still open.
to the horizon.

mark, i'm somewhat taken aback by the ad feminam nature of your comments.
it seems to me that my integrity is being impugned here because i publish
in the venues that are appropriate to my discursive community. it is true,
as i said, that i'm a relative newcomer to this community. does that make
the community which i have been more familiar with (academic cultural
studies) corrupt, disingenuous, self-seeking?  what in the world makes Witz
(whose existence i didn't know of until i joined the list) more virtuous
than, say, social text or cultural critique?  (btw, just about everyone
assumes, when i say urban teenage poets writing in a housing project, that
these youth are Black.  they are white workingclass/lumpen kids, a category
most media do not care to acknowledge. i spell out the demographics very
clearly in the essay itself,  which was published before i knew of any of
these other journals you mention.)

here's the scenario.  i was invited to participate in a conference on "the
poetics of avant garde poetry."  the proposal i submitted seemed confusing
to the organizers (academics, like myself) because i didn't seem to adhere
to a clear notion of what the avant garde was/is.  perhaps it wasn't a very
articulate proposal --i have certainly been guilty of lapses in clarity of
argumentation.  but it seemed to me that their response also resonated with
other responses i've gotten, which is what interested me about the term
"avant-garde" in the first place, the way its used as a weapon.  i myself
have tried to resurrect its military meaning, adding the concept of social
marginality (via a bit of slippery advance-guard/cannon fodder association
others have mentioned here).  so i asked the poetics list for feedback.
you'll recall, my post were queries, not accusations, though i can, in
retrospect, see how its wording could have put people on the defensive.
i've learned a lot, mostly that the term "avant-garde" is used by literary
historians rather than practitioners who tend to feel imprisoned by the
label.  at the same time, those practitioners are very conscious of working
in certain traditions of practice that are distinct from and in many cases
opposed to other traditions of practice --and for many, this distinction is
terribly important. ive gotten some valuable response, the most valuable of
which was sent backchannel because the poster felt the need to protect
him/herself.  and of course, jordan's contribution (new name for avant
garde poetry: poetry) is a gem.

what about my other question: i get a feeling that aesthetic consensus or
at least judgment is very important in this community. am i out to lunch on
this? do you care to nuance, challenge, or elaborate on this?  in some
literary communities or communities of aesthetic practice, such as the
workshop world, any creative activity is welcomed (everyone can be a poet,
etc).  it seems to me that aesthetic appraisal is a very important part of
how *this* (POETIX) community constitutes itself.  perhaps more hegemonic
institutions ( so called "mainstream poetry") can afford a certain kind of
complacent largesse, which wd shut down quickly if it sensed a real threat
of overthrow?

        In "The Vanishing American Hobo" (in Lonesome Traveler) Jack
Kerouac --with a nod to L-F Celine--notes that the police operate out of
nine lines of boredom and one line of law.
        Mark Wallace:
        "I must confess to great boredom over the struggle to define the
meaning of the term 'avant garde'. . .
        " . . . IN THE ACT OF POLICING TO MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT YOU ARE
POLICING AND IN SO DOING CALL YOUR OWN POLICING INTO QUESTION, AND BE
CLEAR AT ALL TIMES THAT YOU LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHICH IS FORCING YOU TO
POLICE . . ."
        Mark Wallace concludes by noting a need for constant vigilance--and
 as well
asserts that people generally blame higher ups for their sorry state.
        Instead according to Mark Wallace it appears they should blame the entire
society for making bored souls turn into cops.

great success . . . )

        I like Bob Grumman's Otherstream taxonomy--and wonder if there is

Tenth Victim": "There was a constant stream of things."
        The murder weapon in that story is a typewriter . . .

I just returned home from the east coast to find a message on my answering
machine from Trimpin saying that Conlon Nancarrow died over the weekend in
Mexico City.  Nancarrow would have been 85 in October.

The American expatriate composer was best known for his series of studies
for player piano, composed and hand-punched on a custom machine, the medium
in which he worked valmost exclusively for much of the last fifty years.
These works were really wonderful extensions of the sound world of the
piano timbrally altered by extremes of tempo, tempo ratios, and unusual
canonic structures.  His few works for live performers (either early works
composed before Nancarrow began focusing on player piano or quite recent
pieces commissioned by performers & ensembles like Ursula Oppens & Arditti
Quartet) have been more rarely heard.

All but the three most recently completed of Nancarrow's Studies for Player
Piano are recorded on Wergo, his other works have been recorded by Arditti
Quartet, Ursula Oppens, Continuum, Joanna MacGregor, and others. In 1995,
Cambridge University Press published a book length study of his work by
Kyle Gann.

Goodness. It would appear that my previous reply to Pete Landers's

I asked, at the beginning, what specifically do you object to in the
documents in question. My point being that it would be a lie to swear an
oath one never meant to keep.

Well, the documents say you do not have to support those laws. If you
oppose a law, according to those documents, you have a right to object.
The people who wrote those documents would be glad to see that you want
to teach the kids to think for themselves, to question authority. I
think you have a superior understanding of the role of a teacher, and we
need more people like you! FWIW, the Constitution doesn't contain any
laws.

I don't understand how any poet or writer can continue to misconstrue my
words. Please only read the ones I have written. I say, if you read
those documents then you will see that they are protecting your right to
teach whatever you see fit. When the school board and the PTA try to ban
a book that you discuss in your small press class, those documents are
supposed to come to your aid. They were written by philosophically
brilliant men, admittedly in a time when women and non-whites and people
who didn't own land had no representation in the government, but they
have been amended. They must be amended further, too. I think *that* is
the way to go.

There are some alternatives to written laws. There's despotism, surely
we don't want that. There's a kind of anarchy I would prefer, but it
requires even more documents and oaths than this ugly oligarchy we live
in. I've looked into Marx and I feel his ideas would fit very nicely
within the framework of this document. For the time being, then, I stake
my hope on the idea that we can all work out our problems with the
structure outlined in the Constitution, and continue to amend it until
the greediest sleezeballs find they are not welcome here.

What I mean is, it's wide open for interpretation. Surely you can sign
it without compromising your values. I personally take the stance that
the Constitution is threatened every day, more from within than without,
yes. For instance, because of my oath I participate in demonstrations if
I disagree, because we have a right to peaceably assemble. And nowhere
in the Constitution does it say we can't do a few more bongs. So here's
to you, one and all. Keep doubting! But please stop misreading me.

The police in Three Digits, Iowa are very avant-garde.  Along with the
usual training in how to use handcuffs and where the nearest Dunkin' Donuts
is, they are required to take 2 creative writing courses (poetry and
prose-poetry), and moreover, to put this training to USE ON THE JOB.

Officer Jim McClain was confronted with a tight situation the other day -
protestors outside the local catfish cannery were getting rowdy (all four
of them).  McClain whipped out his copy of FISH MANTRA by A.G. (Albert
Gimlet), recited it at the top of his lungs, & soon had the crowd under
control.  (see poem below)

In Three Digits, a conviction for shoplifting leads to a 2-day Seminar
on the work of Rod McKuen.  For more serious crimes, offenders are ordered
to "lurk" on the Poetics list for up to 9 months! Nobody gets off easy
in Lil' Three.

FISH MANTRA

Fish!  Fish!  Fish!
I love all fish!
Big fish, little fish!
Cute fish!  Ugly fish!
Even sharks are friends of mine!
I love fish!

(repeat 300 times)

p.s. the poetry program in 3 Digits has no connection with the famous
Iowa Writing Program at U. Iowa, although Jorie Graham's dog Cesca
has been known to moonlight there when she's on tour. (Cesca won the
prestigious Officer Pup Memorial Police Dog Poetry Bark in 1993,
under an assumed name.)

So, Charles Alexander, what did you decide about signing the paper?
Enquiring minds, etc.

What a conversation this has set off.

Who was it that asked about the avant-garde signing loyalty abatements?

The word "policing" has appeared on the List lately; a word that, for me,
will always remain a Boy Scout command for camp busywork, as in "police the
area," i.e., look for gum wrappers in the grass, butts on the asphalt, etc.

Those of us in the advance guard got all the goods. That was in the Valley
Forge Council, southeastern PA, for those of you thinking we may have
pursued merit badges together some long summer ago. I did well in rowing
and swimming, not so well in beekeeping and patriotism.

Yours as ever,

Yes, I agree that texts have contexts, but an oath ... not as I see it.
They can only hold you to the exact words of an oath.

So many fail to understand. This guy wants to teach. He has a
conscience. How can he sign the oath if he objects to some things. I
say, by sticking to the exact wording and not muddying the waters with
the historical context.

mark continues:

Yes. A teacher in a public school is a civil servant, a public servant.
That never meant knuckling under to Rush L. and his cronies.

then...

That's nothing compared to the promises we have to make in the business
world, such as signing away copyrights and patents. Where I work I am
paid to write what I am told to write, but heck, they pay. And if I
don't sign, I don't work. I have written over 10,000 pages for other
people. Frankly, I'm glad it's not under my own name because it's all
shit. My wife has defeated the uncertainty principle in designing a
particular flowmeter, but that patent went to a company. And public
servants must swear to defend the Constitution? They get off easy, IMO.

but this:

>  similar instance is our wonderful pledge of allegiance

Nope. It is not similar. I stopped saying this one years ago when I was
in high school for the exact reasons you outline. Although I was raised
catholic, I was beginning to consider atheism and I realized that people
who had already chosen it were being accused of disloyalty in that
pledge. The Supreme Court had just said those of us who objected did not
have to say it, so I didn't. And I was proud of the kid who put up the
fight.

I don't get this:

>  Maybe these documents are uniquely sacred
> and should be immune to deconstruction.

It seems to me I am saying the opposite, and you are misreading me. You
seem so aware of history. I don't get why the (to me) obvious daily
threats to the Constitution are bundled together with it. For instance,
there isn't supposed to be a standing army in peace time, but we have
one. My point is, I see no attempt to deconstruct the document in your
post. I see only side issues, most of which I agree with.

My advice was, and still is, read it and sign if you can. It's a good
document, though it needs the ERA, for one thing.

Pete: I, too, stopped saying the pledge when Ike slipped in "under
God"--I was 10 or 11 at the time. Good for us.

Charles: I remember that this issue came up at Buffalo in the '60s,
notably with Gregory Corso, who'd been hired without any credentials but
his poetry [hooray for Al Cook, who served as chairman at the time, if
memory serves]. He was teaching Shelley, & was a real pleasure [he
included Newman Ivey White's biography as well as a collected works].
Everything went well for the first few weeks; we adjourned to
Bitterman's bar across the street a few times, & the class went on till
we all knew it was over, not when the bell rang. The University wanted
GC to sign an oath of loyalty to the Constitutions of the United States
and of the State of New York; he assented to the former, but said he'd
not read the latter, & requested a copy. It took a while for someone to
produce the state constitution, & it was very long. CG told the
University he had no time to read it, since he was teaching the class.
So he got canned. A great loss to his students, though it made an
important point at the time to people who thought it made an important
point. The point? Sign it, already: take the money & run. Hungry? Eat.
"Got a headache? Take an aspirin." I signed one to get a teaching
fellowship, without which I couldn't have afforded graduate school &
would have turned my back on a career in which I've managed at least to
present critiques of the USA & beyond; whether I've personally
radicalized anyone, I'm not sure, but I've tried. _A Man for All
Seasons_ makes a great play, but Thomas More was playing for much higher
stakes than anyone today asked to take an oath like the one you've been
asked to take. More important not to betray yourself by letting a
government full of people who daily violate the same oath purge you.
No more Gunga Dins!

Yesterday we received in the mail the lavish color flyer for the u of

God (I mean this as an expletive), I hope this my last contribution to this
thread.

1. As long as memory persists, historical context remains attached to the
words that issued forth from that context. That's why the Supreme Court is
interested in legislative and constitutional history and all courts are
interested in common-law precedent.

2.Police, soldiers and elected and appointed government officials are
servants of the state in a different sense. As they are variously armed,
the state built on the constitution is threatened by overthrow if they
allow their personal opinions to rule their actions on the job. A soldier
in battle may think the commander's strategy is dumb, but he's not legally
allowed to act on his disagreement--the chain of command, which ultimately
goes back to Congress (declarations of war and appropriations) and the
Commander-in-chief, is protected by his understanding of his oath. He has
to subordinate his will to the authority established by the document he
swears to uphold. His general or a group within government could easily, as
they do in most countries, circumvent the document's process by organizing
a putsch--it has been hoped that their oath and the culture of their
professions will restrain them from doing so, and for the most part that
hope has been rewarded. Teachers may subvert the minds of the innocent, but
they don't have tanks or access to same. That's why until recent decades no
one ever required an oath from them, whereas these other guys have been
swearing on the bible as a condition of employment for a long, long time.

3. As to your work situation, I feel your pain.

4. I'm not trying to deconstruct the constitution, although that might be
fun. It's the oaths and pledges I'm after.

Dear Friends, Poets, and All Others:

                    Web Chat SUNDAY, AUGUST 17, 8 p.m. (EST) on
                THE TROUBLE WITH MEDIOCRITY
                                    (On Contemporary Poetry)
                       http://webdelsol.com/SOLCHAT/solchat.htm
                                     (Netscape 3.0 or higher)

       Announcing the first of a three part series sponsored by FlashPoint
(webdelsol.com/FLASHPOINT) and Web Del Sol entitled THE TROUBLE
WITH MEDIOCRITY, PART I.  Carlo Parcelli, a writer, bookseller, and the
editor of FlashPoint--a new and bleeding edge litzine based in the
Washington, DC area--will host and moderate the discussion, focusing
primarily on topics noted in summary-blurbs below, i.e., L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
poetry, the bureaucracy of poetry, The Rule of the Poet Tyrants, and the
comic tragedy of poetry's "self-betrayal."

Also, less specifically on what Carlo and many others feel to be a condition
of mental and artistic palsy effecting the state of American poetry today.
As Carlo so aptly puts it:

"There is the ubiquitous school of  ... "Lawn Mower Poets", the "Simpering
Sonneteers" or the "I-I-ME-ME-I-ME Advanced School of Navel Studies."  Their
only referent is his or her upper-middle class sentimentalized "personal
crisis" -- hairline, waistline, on-line, supermarket line, whatever. ...
[They] ... are agonizingly self-absorbed and solipsistic.  How can people
barnacled with such bourgeois excesses speak to injustices or address
historical events? ... Can they offer third world nationalist movements
anythingin the way of counsel other than capitulation?  [Their] poems have
their solipsistic origins at the poet's window, looking to his/her favorite
tree(s), or more appropriately the poem arises from the poet's couch potato,
psychoanalytic, etc.  Any scrap of history becomes just another referent for
their suburban angst.  ... The language is gassy and loose, as though the
poems were written after a hearty meal.  There are few dynamics, few
allusions that might indicate a world beyond each poem's enervated mass and
tranquilizing cliches."

PART I of THE TROUBLE WITH MEDIOCRITY will take place on August 17, 8
PM
Eastern Standard Time at
http://webdelsol.com/SOLCHAT/solchat.htm   Netscape 3.0 or higher is
necessary to take part.

Room on the Java server is limited (or so I am told), so the earlier the
arrival the better chance for a seat at the table.  No reservations or
holding before 7:45, please.  The Java chat function is fairly intuitive.
Wait till the Java chat applet is fully loaded, then type in a log-on name
and voila.

PART I: Excerpts from Bernstein vs. Stern---Featherweight Division (and
other matters)


"My greatest disappointment in the years I have spent involved with
poetry has been its lack of collegiality. The institutions of poetry
have demonstrated a diffident and exclusionary cunning arising from a
vast critical and editorial insecurity. The public structure of poetry
is filled with frightened bureaucrats.  This is largely because,
mimicking  more successful disciplines, poets at great imaginative cost,
have created tiny fiefdoms for themselves. "


"One could point out that institutions by their very nature
are exclusive and inhumane. But this only prompts the question---What
are poets doing there?  Today's poetry by betraying its own ethos
renders itself weak and ineffectual."


"I was once given a transcript of a symposium of critics and poets. I
have forgotten the time and place of the gathering, but what I do
remember is an awkward exchange between Gerald Stern and Charles
Bernstein on the nature and/or role of poetry, with Marjorie Perloff
serving as an impromptu referee. Stern's position was that of the
soporific and mawkish sentimentalist who found any reflection on the
legitimacy of his poetry an incomprehensible intrusion. Bernstein, on
the other hand, described a set of theoretical notions that he could not
work into any context other than L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry's tautological
elegance. In the argument, Stern, by default, was awarded the world as
subject. Bernstein was left sputtering. The whole exercise was
embarrassing . . ."


(time not yet scheduled for Part II)


PART II: Douglas Hofstadter  Disses  John Cage (and more)

It _is_ an incomprehensible intrusion. Unless you mean someone was
inquiring about the paternity of Stern's poems... what a great way to
rustle up some collegiality! can't wait to crash yr server.

Subject:      loyalty oath of a different color
Content-Type: text

Charles pointed out to me, backchannel that the oath said:

I, _________________________ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will
support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and
laws
of the State of Arizona; That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the
same, and defend them against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that
I
will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of the office of
_______________________ according to the best of my ability, so help me
God
(or, so I do affirm).

The clinker there is "and laws" which is not in the New York State oath.
So *I* am the dolt who misread. Apologies all around.

If I had to sign that, I would balk, too. It seems to me that a teacher
shouldn't have to support laws. Kids should know about the possibility of
civil disobedience. Laws can't have domestic enemies, for instance, and
any text that says such is lame-brained. I'd say it has always been a duty
to oppose laws that one disagrees with. Now I think that the oath is
un-Constitutional.

Since you and others must get past this hurdle in order to teach, sign it,
anyway, and if they nail someone with it, if for instance, adultery laws
are used to fire a teacher, or someone is fired for teaching Thoreau, then
there's a case for the courts, if you want. IMO, the oath foreswears
itself by its own un-Constitutionality.

And Mark, I agree on many points, but which is better, to sign or not.
Shall we make a federal case for Charles or for the Corso case? I bet,
given the same predicament, you would choose one ot the other. And I'm
sure you have not finished saying your peace on this and other important
issues. Or at least, I hope not. Basically, I don't think McCarthy
invalidates Jefferson, but beyond that we're almost 100% agreed.

with respect for all (but the kid who called me a running dog),

Pete

Controversy (& Poetry) Reign as Mouth Almighty
Wins National Slam Championship
Da Boogey Man Becomes First Male Slam Champ

(Aug. 10: Middletown CT) In a series of poetry slams marked by official
protests and concluding with boos mixed with thunderous applause, Mouth
Almighty came back from a semifinal defeat to Chicago to win the 8th National
Poetry Slam held in the huge Freeman Auditorium before 900 screaming poetry
lovers. The scores of the Finals looked like this: Mouth Almighty: Mouth
Almighty 115, Chicago 110, Cleveland 109.8, Worcester 105.85.

The protests were both lodged against Mouth Almighty, a team of New York City
all-stars; both were disallowed. They pointed, however, to a deep concern in
the Slam Family about corporate sponsorship (Mouth Almighty is the world's
first major poetry label), as well as to the all-star nature of the team:
Regie Cabico, Evert Eden, Taylor Mali, Beau Sia, with Bob Holman as coach.
“This begins the era of the Super Team!” shouted an ecstatic Cabico, whose
coming out to Mom poem, performed as a duet Mali, was the evening’s final and
highest scoring poem.

In the Individual Slam, Da Boogey Man, stalwart of the Cleveland team which
was undefeated going into the Finals, read two powerful, slow-paced poems
which resonated strongly in the air hanger fieldhouse. Patricia Smith, who
along with Slam Founder Marc Smith was hosting the Individual Finals,
announced that this was the first time in the history of Slam that a man had
won the prize. DJ Renegade of Washington, DC finished second for the third
year in a row, with Glenis Redmond-Sherer of Greenville, NC, taking third.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

it occurs to me (slow-witted that i am) that one of the problems lurking
just beneath the surface of the avant-garde thread has to do with how one
understands oneself...

i mean, if you define yourself simply as a "writer," on the basis of doing
different sorts of writing for different sorts of audiences on different
sorts of presses at different times, you'll likely find any tag a
restriction of sorts, mebbe even an ontological restriction... b/c at any
moment, you may find yourself outside or inside a particular network of
writerly affiliations, or if you wish, community...

one of the problems i have with academic-scholarly writers (that is, with
those who define themselves as such, which is occasionally a function of
their failure to define themselves as such!) is that they sometimes take
for granted their position as writers within the academic publishing
system... which sometimes leads to a sort of pooh-poohing of motivations,
if not articulations, that seem to these folks to fall too far afield...
and of course, these days, contemporary poetry in general generally falls
too far afield...

one of the problems i have with more avant-garde writers---most of whom,
owing to the sort of work they do, *are* acutely aware of public perception
and reception (and again, i'm using a-g w/o any critical interference, as a
descriptor)---is that they sometimes dig in on the aesthetic issues in
particular... as though community itself turned on towing a certain
aesthetic line... which, for me, has always been a questionable way of
forging human relationships, though i'll grant that things can be
rough-going when you really don't like somebody's work!... i've always
mself felt a particular affinity for folks who work hard and get little
public acclaim---by the general public, i mean... and end up barely making
artistic ends meet...

one of the problems i have with more conventional writers, trade press
writers---some or perhaps many of whom simply do not understand the degree
to which their aesthetic is one among many aesthetics---is that they often
achieve "success" without a whole lot in the way of identifying why... that
is, what registers they're playing, *as* registers... which translates, for
one, to me being able to appreciate their work, while they don't seem to
appreciate mine...

i guess i have problems with all sorts of writers!... and having written in
all three categories (only recently trying to make the transition into more
conventional work), it's fair to say that i feel the stresses and strains
attendant to each... moreover, i teach technical and professional
writing---and it's really easy from this vantagepoint to see how these
different sorts of commitments, motivations, publishing realities can work
to obscure what different publics perceive as "good" or "bad" work...

i hope i'm clear on one point, anyway:  that though pluralism is not w/o
its attendant risks, one can inhabit multiple spaces---or to drop that
geometric metaphor for a moment---multiple processes... i would think that
what's necessary is a capacity for not bullshitting oneself into believing
that one is doing x while in actuality one is doing y... but of course x's
and y's are negotiable too---sometimes shit happens...

best,

joe

"D.J. Renegage of Washington DC"

that's "Renegade" (prob. a clickstream slip)

...and he's a really interesting smart and committed poet. Anyone here
familiar with his work? Maybe the other DC'ers?


"Incidentally, Henry Taylor, Pulitzer Prize winning poet for his book The
Flying Change, did enter as an individual. He didn't even make it to the
semi-final
round."

I hope I'm wrong, but I somehow can only read that as a snide bit against
Henry Taylor. He is, after all, a "mainstream" poet (get thee behind me
terminology). Yet, Henry Taylor is *really* an experimental poet. That is,
he experiments with his poetry and how he writes and presents it (using
experiment in the loose and unrelated-to-science meaning the word is given
in the arts). He's had a long-term correspondence with Jackson Maclow and
written very well on Jackson's work and written work of his own using
techniques similar to/inspired by/identical to/something like... Jackson's.
The engagement proceeded from seeing a book of Maclow's at a yard sale (I
think), buying it and allowing its foreignness to anything he'd
done/thought up to that point to operate as inspiration.

I assume his jumping into the slam pool (I sure as hell wouldn't do it [did
anyone see Kim Dawn there?]) reflects the same sinew and flex. Good for him.

Jordan, is this part of the "everything is always less" slipknotjestreamthread?

the Nw Yolker had an article about Frank Gehry [note the Nagram] avoiding
architectural/critical debates & just making things.  Here's someone who
turns back the technical in the most advanced degree of a profession into
the handmade. See the titanium museum just put up in Bilboa Spain.
the space of the handmade poem.  [Avoidance was not neutrality, just
attention.]

Avant-garde = handmade.

Avant-garde = homemade.

Avant-garde = unprocessed, unscreened.

the faded Bhagavad by G. Stein on the Himalayan hillside rocks.

Dan Bouchard's MASS AVE was in my mailbox today.  He's done a very simple
handmade thing - put a magazine together of a few poets, not too much of a
miscellany, just the poems.  very simple.  foregrounds the poems.  easing
the mind.  homemade lemonade.  walking home today there were two blonde
sisters, must have been six & eight, by the side of the road selling a
"Moth Show".  I thought it was lemonade at first - but no, a moth show.
they had some little cartons - one had some grass in it, they said the
caterpillar had crawled away.  The other had a little dead blue moth in it,
which they said was a butterfly because it was prettier than the moths
[I said some moths are like that, but they could be right.]  Then they had
a big jar with 2 live brown moths.  The small one said, "My sister will
show you the cemetery we made for the dead moths."  I said that's o.k., I have
to get on home.  They had 2 handpainted signs - one said 15 cents, the other
55 cents - I said, which is it?  They said 55.  But they didn't have change,
so I gave them a dollar.  The show was worth it.  I would have liked
to have met their mother - they both had blue-green eyes.

Kent, at last! someone i know (in the cyber-sense) who has been abducted. I
want to tell you what your experience was like.

It was like everyone else's. Who has been taken up into a USAF anti-gravity
craft. The laser beam that carries the anti-gravity charge 'beamed' you up.
The distortion imposed upon vision by the anti-gravitational field made
humans in spacesuits resemble the 'alien' as often described. They probe yr
orifices because thats what they find the most fun to do, its not for
science its to kill time while you have an abduction experience so that you
will talk about it later & further the space-creatures myth.

These flashbacks you have been having, that cause you to doubt yr own
perception f reality, will cease thanks to this explanation i am giving to
you. There will be no more Yasusadas. And those wishing to continue
discussing Yasusada One will do so until there is no one left who wishes to
discuss it with them. People will stop talking during movies. Drivers will
rediscover the use of the turn signal.Instead of applying the term "avant
garde" or any substitute therefore to contemporary poets, people will name
that poet and name any other poet they wish to associate with him/her.
Instead of "The avant garde writers Susan Howe and Clark Coolidge..." we
will read "The writers Susan Howe and Clark Coolidge...".
Readers who dont know the work of the named writers will have to look it
up. If one or more of them exclaims to him/herself, "Great God, Carruthers,
Avant-gardistes !", this cry will not reach us where we sit.

You know how sometimes a post comes via e-mail that has 40 other e-ddresses
in its header, along with your own? Well _that_ is how scholarly books and
articles will look, with 40 or more names of poets lumped together wherever
the author needs to make a general statement that applies to each of them.
"As Robert Hass, Brenda Hillman, Robert Pinsky, Tess Gallagher, Stephen
Mitchell, Jane Hirshfield, Diana O'Hehir, Bob Perelman, Aldon Neilsen, Doug
Powell, Cydney Chadwick, Ron Silliman, Lyn Hejinian, Steven Vincent, Jack
Foley, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Richard Silberg, Joyce Jenkins, Jack
Hirshman, Kathleen Fraser, Steve Tills, Jennifer Moxley, Steve Benson,

Lucille Clifton, Dianne Di Prima, Steve Farmer, Victor Hernandez Cruz,
Duane BigEagle, Nick Piombino, and David Bromige demonstrate, the linear,
like the aerial on a Buick Park Lane, can be bent without being snapped
off." Or "unlike," as experience dictates. It is a pleasure to write the
name of a poet. There will be more pleasure in the writing of scholarly
articles. Some of these will consist only in a list of names. Soon all of
them will consist only in a list of names. But only with the coming of the
fascist world state will these lists be identical.

Poetry will be classified into just two categories: safe and unsafe, as in
sex. So it will be an allowable shortcut to refer to "the unsafe poetry of
Barrett Watten" or "the safe poetry of Dana Gioia." It will be a redundancy
of sorts, but it holds the possibility of humor, so lets keep it.

Yes, it is a bright future we contemplate, but one day the alien myth will
be used to shut everything down and world fascism will be accomplished.

We will still have music--but it may not be Mary Martin singing "My heart
belongs to daddy."

Mark, your post on the relation of avant garde to academy is really
wonderful and even better it is useful. A person reading it can use it in
thinking about her/his life.

A couple of points, however. There is a tendency to think of academy as
institution (correct) and avant garde as... anarchy/utopia/individualism/?
Just a tendency, mind you. And this leads you to formulate a picture of
unestablished avantgardists pointing envy (or whatever) at established
avantgardists because of their position *in the academy* -- i.e. in another
institution.

No this is intra-institutional politics. The avantgarde (non-mainstream
poetry, cosa nostra -- call it what you want) is an institution, and
position in it is critical to and at stake for all those committed to the
institution.

I believe the point important, because it allows one to ask what the
relation is of a practice of writing ----- which hopes (by whatever means
and to whatever end *other* than institutional acceptance) actually to *be*
avantgarde, using whatever loose re-denotation you want for the term: i.e.
to be "new" "sui generis" "experimental" whatever ----- to the
institution(s) in which it cannot escape participation.

The utility of this question -- not of an answer, just of the question --
is that it dissipates complaint.

I conceptualize people who view others (more established others) with envy,
for example, as having a view of social space on the model of a Go or chess
board. It's finite, structured, and occupied. You want to occupy space you
gotta force somebody out of the space you want to occupy. Institutional
space is always like this in some sense, in some retrospective sense.

In fact, the social space of an institution (e.g. such as avantgarde
poetry) is more like legos or tinker toys (for those who remember them).
It's additive, and the more you add in a given direction, the more you move
the center of the institution in that precise direction. There's nothing
ambiguous about it.

Hence, it doesn't do to conclude that we must constantly monitor our
policing positions in the institutions which entail us. Constantly monitor
equals self-police, and in the hermeneutic circle of this thought Mark is
thinking, that very self-monitoring begins to found the so-called
hierarchical discipline/punish society we occupy in which "the only way to
make a living at all is to police somebody" (that is, it founds *a vision*
of society along these lines).

I think I've allowed myself to become too abstract; what is the question
here? How to become independent as a poet, let us say. How to cut or at
least loosen the leash? The noose?

If you are a really good teacher, then teach. If you are a really good
poet, then write. But, "I am a really good poet" provides you with no
rights whatever to be published. Ditto, "...good teacher." If you are a
good writer you will find readers however. And a teacher finds students.

Henry, Pete, and list:
Just to make it clear! I was not referring to Pete Landers as an
"imperialist running dog" for feeling fine about his oath. Sorry
about that misunderstanding. My title meant to poke a bit of
self-reflexive fun at my own undying revolutionary dreams, in
politics as in poetry. (tho I am absolutely confident we are merely
in a pause, and that the left is coming back.)
Kent
ps: "Imperialist Running Dog" was actually the name of a wonderful,
slobbering, and loving dog I was once master to.

Tom, thank's for correcting my D.J. Renegade typo.Yes, D.J.'s one of
the best on the slam scene--for the last three years he's been runner-up
in the Slam National Individual Finals. His writing (I know only the handful
of pieces that I've seen him perform) would probably "hold up" of the page,
as well.

I am a fan of Henry Taylor's poetry, though I have trouble seeing him as
"out there" or "on the edge," if that's the sense you mean by "experimental."

I find it strange to tag work with "the finish" of Henry Taylor's as EXP.

It was certainly a surprise for certain slam poets to see H. Taylor at the
Nationals,
I can tell you that Bob Holman (Nuyurican/Mouth Almighty) was very
deferential
and praising of Taylor the night of the Semis, when Taylor, already knocked
out,
served as judge. Most of the poets and slammers at the Nationals didn't know
Henry Taylor from a hole in the ground. Some (emphasis on "some") don't read
much.

I applaud Taylor for participating. I didn't get to talk to him enough to get
at his
real intent--was it: a serious attempt to win it all; to study, field work
on, so to
speak, the slam phenomenon; or just curiousity, and an interest in exploring
his
work as performance before large and appreciative crowd? As I said, he got
knocked out by the second round--however, the night I saw him recite
("Landscape With Tractor"), he was applauded with vigor and sincerity.

Here's the text of Taylor Mali's first round poem. Sans head jerks on "like"
(and head jerks that "replace" or "place" the "likes" as Lilly is weaned),
parachute opening "uhwHOOMp," and tight gesture choreography, for your sheer
textual enjoyment.

B>Like Lilly Like Wilson
by Taylor Mali

I’m writing the poem that will change the world,
and it’s Lilly Wilson at my office door.
Lilly Wilson, the recovering like addict,
the worst I’ve ever seen.
So bad the whole eighth grade
started calling her Like Lilly Like Wilson.
‘Til I declared my class a Like-Free Zone
and she could not speak for days.

But when she finally did, it was to say,
Mr. Mali, this is . . . so hard.
Now I have to . . . think before I . . . say anything.

Imagine that, Lilly.

Its for your own good.
Even if you don’t like . . .
it.

I’m writing the poem that will change the world,
and it’s Lilly Wilson at my office door.
Lilly is writing a research paper for me about how gays
like shouldn’t be allowed to adopt children.
I’m writing the poem that will change the world,
and it’s Like Lilly Like Wilson at my office door.

Lilly’s having trouble finding sources,
which is to say, ones that back her up:
They all argue in favor of what I thought I was against.

And it took all four years of college,
three years of graduate school,
and every incidental teaching experience I have ever had
to let out only,

That’s a real interesting problem, Lilly.
But what do you propose to do about it?
That’s what I want to know.

And the eighth-grade mind is a beautiful thing;
Like a new-born baby’s face, you can often see it
change before your very eyes.

I can’t believe I’m saying this, Mr. Mali,
but I think I’d like to switch sides.

And I want to tell her to do more than just believe it,
but to enjoy it! That changing your mind is one of the best ways
of finding out whether you still have one.
Or even that minds are like parachutes,
that it doesn’t so much matter what you pack them with
so long as they open
at the right time.

I want to say all this but manage only,
Lilly, I am like so impressed with you.

So I finally taught someone something,
namely, how to change your mind.
And learned in the process that if I ever change the world
it’s going to be one eighth grader at a time.

Hi Michael

Yes please, I'd love a copy, but don't have a fax.
I could get the use of one to receive, but don't
have the number now. My address is:

104 Rosary Road

Let me know whether you'd like me to get the fax

What Derrida have you read? Can I ask you what
you think of my question: what *textual*

Gratefully

        I want to second Tom Mandel's comments about the interest of the
work of D.J. Renegade and Henry Taylor, but perhaps also to expand a
little about them.

        D.J. is a D.C. poet who, about a decade ago, more or less
"chose" to become homeless for several years, so that instead of spending
all his time at annoying jobs
to make enough money to live in D.C., he could spend all his time reading
up on the history of poetry and much else in D.C's many public libraries,
including the Library of Congress. At this point he's quite well
known both here in D.C. and on the national slam circuit. He was the
subject of a feature length article, with front page photograph, of one
issue of Washington's City Paper, a widely-distributed free weekly that
reaches several hundred thousand people with every issue. Along with much
else about him, that issue dealt in great detail on the way he had
recently lost two national slam championships--the reason for both losses
being ONLY that he exceeded the time limit for the reading by a few
seconds in each case. Either that's a silly thing to do, or a silly rule
in the first place--my own sense is probably the latter.

        With a few exceptions, I've never been all that convinced about
his poems on the page. But he is a truly electrifying performer when he
chooses to be, capable of taking listeners on a real roller coaster ride.
To my mind, though, the subject of gender is something of a problem in his
work--women tend for the most part in his work to be people he is trying
to love but who don't love him back, althugh he doesn't quite go so far as
objectifying them, at least usually. Probably this would be a flaw in
anyone's poetry, but it seems particularly important in the context of the
identity issues that motivate much of his work.

        I agree with Tom that Henry Taylor's essay on Jackson Mac Low is
very strong, and Henry's own work using some of Mac Low's methods is quite
interesting. I published one of those pieces in Situation #12. As he
himself has said, that part of his work is TRULY mystifying to the more
traditional formalist poets who tend to be his compatriots. Still, there's
something perhaps troubling about it--the ONLY kind of of more
structurally innovative work that he's done is work using computer
methods. I'm a big fan of such work, but I get the sense, sometimes, that
there may be the implication that he doesn't see the difference between
computer generated texts and ALL "avant garde" poetry, as if, to put it
into terms that he might use, he still hasn't put into practice the idea
of consciously CRAFTING poems in other than traditional structures. He'll
let computers generate alternative structures, but he won't try to "write"
in such structures the way he will "write" in traditional ones.

        Both D.J. and Henry have been invited to read, and did read, in
several of the reading series we sponsor here in D.C. for "avant garde"
work, as well in the venues of slam poetry (and, in Henry's case, for
academic audiences). Recently, there was a reading at Border's in which,
according to the promotional information, "slam poets" directly challenged
"academic poets" to a performance slam--who "won" depended, in this case,
on which kind of work people liked better in the first place. But this was
only one of a recent group of events in which these two "groups" appear
together on the same stage. A CD, compiled by Jeffrey McDaniel, features
work from the slam series "Live at the Black Cat" (I may not have this
title correct) that has Henry, D.J., and others on it--I would appreciate
anyone who can remind me of the label.

        Although Tom says he probably wouldn't dare perform at a slam, Rod
Smith, Buck Downs, myself and several others have performed our more
"avant garde" (if you will) work at quite a few Black Cat slams. We've
done things like multi-voice pieces and other approaches, and I even read
once from my new Edge Book NOTHING HAPPENS AND BESIDES I WASN'T THERE
while sitting on the floor with my back to the audience. We got good
applause--my own personal highlight in applause came at the point that I
gave the audience the finger. They loved it. Our work didn't make it onto
the CD, although Jeff McDaniel later said to me he thought he had made a
mistake in leaving it off. I don't see it so much as a conscious attempt
to leave "avant garde" poetries out as it was, perhaps, a failure to think
about including such work.

        When Jeff left D.C. for L.A. last year, the Black Cat series seems
to have died, and the D.C. slam scene has been a little harder for me at
least to track down, because I don't hear from anyone who tells me where
they're going on, and they're not as well advertised as they used to be.
Still, I think it's at least partly true to say that while there seem to
be more meetings between "slam poets" and "academic poets" on the D.C.
slam
scene these days, avant garde work for the most part is NOT part of that
scene, although again, that's not because anyone's being PREVENTED from
reading. But it's a scene, and to be part of it you have to be part of it,
and to feel like there's some value in your being part of it.

        On a side note, Robert Hale seems to have "cautioned" me twice now
not to forget that historical limiations on the very possibility of what
writing can be make it impossible for someone to write "what they want."
It's a point I've looked at a number of times myself, although Robert
can't be faulted for not knowing that. Still, Robert, if you'll
backchannel me with
your mailing address, I'd be glad to send you a copy of my recent chapbook
of poetics dialogues with Jefferson Hansen, which brings up the issue many
times. Having said all that, though, the fact that there may literally be
some things our historical moment prevents us from knowing about what
writing might be (although I assume also that we can't know what we're
prevented from knowing, because otherwise we'd know it), I don't think
that that makes the idea that one might write as one wants a "fantasy."
One chooses what one wants to write from all the available options one can
imagine--such options may not be endless but one can still choose to want
them. So, frankly, I DO write what I want. Of course, the next step after
that is that one will be faced with the consequences of that choice.

        Lastly, I'm sorry if Maria Damon or anyone else perceived me to be
attacking her "personally." That was not my intention, nor was it my
intention even to analyze the totality of her involvements. Rather, I was
analyzing what I saw as the confusions in a few
particular comments, with an eye not so much to attacking anyone as to
contributing to the chance of thinking through what seems to me an
important problem. I still stand by my analysis, although it was meant
as no more final than anything else on this list. But to the extent that
any of my previous comments actually DID attack her personally (which I'm
still not sure they did), or even to the extent that they can be construed
as such, I certainly apologize for that aspect, at least, of what they

 Second thing

I am at the other end. brutalizing myself, looking for action, told Dandy
I was hot for him, drunk and on atavan onpurpose so the words would just
slide out like noodles, like strings of pearl=s   for him, they shouldve
been, he shouldve seen them that way but he didnt.  I threw myself on a
errect penis, it went straight through me, ooh the bruises.  I bruised
and gnashed and shook and slid with all my desperate might.  Sandy said
no

Dandy said, when I called him this morning to say please dont tell Bruisy,
I was wrong to say those things and I do not want to hurt Bruisy and it it
would, he said, "please dont think that I dont feel compassion for you
just cause I dont feel passion"  I would care if I really cared about
him.  Its just the hot flicker of sex and rejection I am chasing, what
Slim cant give, what I cant get from Slim.

Now hes worried that Ill be doe eyed and downcast around him, but he
understande so little.  It couldve been anyone for me, and I know, though he
might deny it, that he only said no because he doesnt know his own
heart.  I am a queen to him, I know it, I am certain, he could not not want
me.

And I am the bearer of precious gifts, soft words which explode
when you stroke them or let yourself remember them.  I have given Dandy
words to recall as he falls asleep.  Which will half rouse his cock, but
maybe will just make him wince, cause he thinks I am lame.  I dont feel
anything for him.  Its just the thrill in the air of a glance that leaves
a man hard, frightened and obsessed.  I thought he might be like that.

Fawn,I want someone like that!!!!  I want to feel my hard powwer.  I want
them to lick and whimper and beg, and be cute and be my equal and change
to something else, a King.  And throughout I dont want to lose Slim.  I
want someone who will match me and up the stakes.  I want to be hot for
someone sexually for once!!  And them to resist me, I want Dandy to come
to me and admit he is broken by love for me, and craves me, and hates it
and is bathed in shame from it.

I want the man, the man, give me the
cool sexy horny useless fucked up speechless with reverance and terror
man.  Make him say no and yes.  Make him kill himself because he feels
his body cannot contain a love this gigantic and angry and fearsome and
tesselating.  I want them dead from love, like me.

Yours in solidarity and vigilance, sister.

Emily Vey Duke.

Tom--
This is interesting, vis-a-vis several of my previous points; first off,
it reiterates that interesting spatial image of "avant-garde" as a
relatively static zone, rather than an advancing attack...Thus showing
again how most of us have toned-down the original feel of "avant-garde"...

But more peculiar and fascinating is the claim that "a-g" is an
institution...I think it is probably more a series of fragmentary zones of
activity...

In other words, it's important to be clear whether we're talking about a
sociological phenomenon, an identifiable social grouping we can study (as
in your post) or a series of esthetic engagements and projects.  In the
former sense, both "workshop poetry" and non-mainstream writing are of
course institutional matrices, with magazines, imprints, sources of
funding; there is of course a huge disparity in available resources, and
one is closer to the basic economic life of things, can provide more jobs,
etc.--is linked as it were to *other* institutions, that provide a support
structure.  But in the latter sense of these terms, neither a workshop
poet nor an "experimental" (hate that word) poet, is necessarily absorbed
by an "institution."  I've known (indeed know) practitioners of both
approaches, who for various reasons are marginal to or outside the
institutional frameworks--whether APR/university or Sun and
Moon/Naropa--and in this sense, there is not a single
economicosociological network, that automatically encompasses everything
written in a given style or tendency.

Also, the emphasis on "envy" etc. is interesting (like the original
phrasing of this thread in terms of "policing")...Some of the most
remarkable writers I know seem to have very little concern with shoving
and scuffling for position; their concern with the activity and the work,
and relative lack of concern with rewards and ego, can be quite
striking...

Subject:      avant-garde

some interesting quotes from Mikhail Epstein's wonderful book AFTER THE
FUTURE:

"A.M. Pachenko, a specialist in Old Russian culture, writes, 'The life of
the holy fool is a conscious negation of the beautiful, a rejection of the
customary ideal, or, more precisely, an inversion of this ideal and an
elevation of the ugly to an aesthetically positive level.' But the same is
brought as an accusation against the avant-garde by its critics from the
standpoint of 'good taste' and 'high ideals' (examples my be found in the
work of Marxist and Orthodox religious writers alike).  The avant-garde
is a holy fool's art, consciously going forth to its own humiliation, to the
mutilation of its own aesthetic face, even to the point that a urinal may
take a sculpture's place on display, and a pathetic, twisted 'dyr bur schil
ubeschur' may take the place of beautiful poetic harmonies."

"Clearly, such holy foolery is an anti-aesthetic phenomenon, but may also
be positively defined as a religious phenomenon... the significance of the
avant-garde as a religious negation of art by artistic means becomes clear.
Art becomes impoverished, pathetic in order to partake of God's fate..."

"The artist bespatters his public with spit and abuse, so as to provoke its
indignation and mockery in return.  As for the holy fool, 'he continually
provokes his viewers...casts stones, muck and filth at them...outrages their
sense of propriety.'  This characterization of a holy fool may equally well
be applied to the scandalous conduct of the Russian and Italian futurists, the
French dadaists and surrealists.  Scandal, a flagrant toppling of social norms,
exposes a more deeply paradoxical system of values, wherein the high takes on
the visage of the low."

"Alexei Kruchenykh's 'dyr bul schil ubeschur' or Velimir Khlebnikov's
'gzi-gzi-gzeo' are akin to glossolalia and oblique mutterings, comprehensible
to the holy fool alone... obliqueness is a device for expressing the
inexpressibility of the inexpressible - things that do not yield themselves
to the tongue..."

Epstein links the avant-garde to the iconoclastic radicalism of the 2nd
commandment (thou shalt not make any graven image...):
"Avant-garde art is closer to the icon than to artistic painting, and
still closer to the characters & signs found in monotheistic churches,
than to the icon: its subject is the passing away of the world, rolled
up and sealed like a scroll... This is the realism of an apocalytpic age
that has realized the unstable and spectral nature of all worldly
arrangements.  This is apocalyptic realism."

But Epstein doesn't rest in a dramatic or overblown characterization of
the avant-garde.  He concludes this particular essay with a closer look
at some contemporary conceptualist poets (Rubinshtein,
Prigov, & others) & finds their essence in a kind of humility, or
dispersal of bombast.  "It becomes clear that the role of
the contemporary avant-garde and of conceptualism in particular is to aid
in the process of self-purification that Russian culture must undergo.
The tendency toward avant-gardism in our sociopolitical history is both
underlined and crossed out.... Conceptualism is the gloomy but gay funeral
procession of all the ideas that tormented the soul of the people for
centuries, with their mania for power, unity, victory, and obligatory happiness
.  But as it sends false faith down to defeat, conceptualism declines to
utter its own.  Without making any assertions about God, it acknowledges
deviation from him."


Epstein's essay is perhaps already "dated" in its reflections on 80s &
early 90s Russian poetry.  But it seems clear that he is presenting
a more historically and otherwise-specific definition of "avant-garde"
than we have been throwing around.  & for us "scandal" would take on
another meaning in a culture in which art is very much in fashion, trendy,
and the power to shock is "played out" in order to show there is no longer
any such power (over & over), no scandal (unless the scandal of "failure").
The anti-aesthetic was co-opted here long ago, it seems.  Or maybe just
echoed over megaphones.

The only Thai poets I know who use computers work in academia and most
budgets do not provide for email.  The only one I know with email works for
a large marketing firm.  Most poetry here is handwritten and sung, not read.
One of Thailand's finest poets is known as one of its finest painters; his
written work is sealed in the darkness of the frames.  I know because I ran
Chiang Rai's one and only gallery: Ahimsa (fallen victim, unfortunately, to
the disintegration of the Thai economy); for three years I hung these poems
facing the wall so that the paintings would sing.

I wouldnt want anyone judging my poetry who hadnt ever speculated about the
similarities among drag, draw, drawl, crawl and trawl. There needs to be an
exam these persons must take & pass before they can judge poetry. You dont
get to be a judge at a musical recital w/o knowing about chords keys
modulation pace pitch or at least playing scales. But people think (?)
because language "comes right out of them" thats all it takes to know
poetry. But they dont think an ability to recognize a fart qualifies them
to judge music. Just because i can differentiate (with difficulty, I admit)
among singles, fives, tens and twenties, doesnt make me a financial
adviser. Its hard enough to find a jury of one's peers (due to the
balkanization of american poetry) : a jury of the frost-bitten or the
sandburged is intolerable. How has this been allowed to come about? Its
like, the less you know, the less prejudiced you will be. I think _I_
should administer the Pentagon black budget.  AAggghh.


Likewise, how can persons less sensitive to the ramifications of a word,
have the right to make you swear to be loyal to the state? They cant hear
the nuances, present & potential, of those words. To them it means
something between love your mother & dont make waves. Or put your head in
this trap. They dont hear the history singing in it, they dont see the
stupidity lying in wait within it. Noone should draw up a loyalty oath who
hasnt written essays on the words loyalty and oath, and those essays
awarded A's by a panel of linguists, poets & political scientists of all
stripes. When the pretense of equality reigns, stupidity is enthroned.
Stupid people have a right to live, thats what civilization must mean, but
the tonedeaf shouldnt be sitting in judgement on child prodigies. Existence
makes the law an ass. Noone should be allowed to flush a toilet who hasnt
cleaned an outhouse. Who hasnt gone a day without water in the desert. Who
hasnt dug a well all morning long, until the drops of dew disappear from
the desert rose and reappear on his forehead. Noone should be permitted to
judge a poetry contest who fails to diagram that last sentence. Who is
custodiating the custodians? Who has to clean up after the janitors? I have
nothing against the demotic--just give me a break. Cut me sone slack, here.
How did everything get turned ass-backwards? Why are these drooling
nonentities ruling our minds? And when are we going to send the marines to
switzerland and reclaim the savings & loan money that belongs to you & me
--$20 grand per person? Dont get me started.  David

let me revise my previous statements. in our society the power to shock
is both still around AND co-opted.  Witness the attacks on arts organizations
around the country by fundamentalist groups.  In a sense these political
organizations "co-opt" scandal by incorporating it into political power
strategies of name-calling & scapegoating.  At the other extreme,
corporations co-opt scandal (or sexuality) & use it to sell products.

let me repeat, in my lexicon avant-garde = handmade.  I view art as
manual labor, blue-collar work, also cottage industry, self-employment.
Necessarily local though not necessarily parochial (in fact ultimately
cosmopolitan in a rooted sense).

homemade space is space made home.  this is dangerous talk for
blind corporations, parasite institutions & old boy's clubs.
Imagine community empowerment reining in corporate power.

Two more installments of the monthly Impercipient Lecture Series (ILS) have
appeared since our initial announcement to the List in June.

Aldon L. Nielsen's "No Saints in Three Acts: On Stephen Jonas," should begin
appearing in mailboxes today.  Nielsen is among the first to give Jonas's work
the careful attention it both deserves and, in light of its fractured political
commitments, demands.  Great archival finds, including a powerful description
of the Baraka/Jonas correspondence, combined with Nielsen's signature ability
to practice a utopic form of close reading that models the desegregated mind
while acknowledging the still-segregated social body, makes this a must read.

Beth Anderson's "Imperturbable Things: On Still-Life Poetics" is a wonderfully
original meditation on the deceptive stillness at the heart of the
linguistic storm
in the work of Wallace Stevens, Barbara Guest, Marjorie Welish, Keith Waldrop,
Ann Lauterbach, and others.  Despite our canny release of this pamphlet in
June,
just as the blockbuster shown on Still Life got underway at New York's Museum
of Modern Art, a handful (literally) of copies are still available.

We've also recently done a small reprint of our inaugural issue, "The Dynamics
of Literary Change" by co-editor Steve Evans.  A fair number of our issue on
Bob Perelman's _The Marginalization of Poetry_ remain in supply.

The two back-issues that are unfortunately out of print at this time are:
1.2     Radical Dogberry and Society Sketches by Chris Stroffolino
1.3     The Ground is the Only Figure by Rosmarie Waldrop

Finally, to all the List-members who have shown support for the ILS through
contributions verbal and financial: Thank You!

Does anyone know anything about the following address on the web?
"Writing the Speculative: A Symposium on Poetry and Knowledge" (May
3, 1997, Stanford University)
   http://shc.stanford.edu/shc/poetry.knowledge.html

It comes up under a key search, but when I try to go in, I get
"Error: 404. File not found. Check the URL you are using."

Any info anyone could provide on this interesting-sounding site?
Thanks, Kent

Kent,

Try
http://shc.stanford.edu/shc/1996-1997/96-97events/poetry.knowledge.html

But this just gives a schedule. I'm not sure it tells you much about what
the symposium was like. Perhaps Hank Lazer or Marjorie Perloff (are you two
still on this poetics list?) will fill us in.

this horse has probably been well beaten here but i'll add my bit anyway.
i think the phenomena is similiar to that seen with respect to liberal
(discussed
on this list earlier this year).  They both have become so entangled in the
popular
press that they have been turned into pejorative mudslinging terms that have
little
relation to the original sense of the terms.  In turn, their adherents become
more so ('liberal'->radical or 'avant-gardeish') and the spiral continues.
am i making sense?
is there a term for this cultural phenomenon?

moved to post this from a sunny rural spot with the kids back in school in
rural TN
after hearing last night of the reaffirmation of the KKK here and knowing i
will soon hear from my pre-adolescents "You can't make me, you old liberal
avant-garde _____, you."

Sushila's shawl


dear Sushila your shawl how you gave it to me how I wore it
December in Bombay December in south India how you wrapped me
in the spring peach shawl a cotton so fine falling like water in the sun

how we met by the temple of Hanuman and you gave me saris white and blue
the handsewn white petticoat your white laughter and dark eyes
your stories of the great one in a village of south India

in the hanging gardens by the Arabian Sea how you told me secrets
whispers on a wood bench splashes on dark rocks
full Indian moon falling like water down warm slopes of Bombay night

how I listened to every word to every pause to the light in your hands
and eyes
to the movement of the shawl the movement of my breathing and yours
the movement of the water below and our feet on the stones

how I still have the shawl oh how I still have it how I took it to south
India
laid it out on the hill above the village that night after seeing the
great one
how I sat under the moon slept there woke in deep Christmas night

how no one understood the shawl the hill the moon or my going
but you did Sushila back in the city you took me in and your father gave
me his bed
his place on the screened porch above Bombay streets with the shining
black birds

how I stayed with you till it was time to go how I fit it all into my
pack
the saris the petticoat the books the little buddha the stories the moon
and the shawl
falling like water in the sun Sushila like water in the spring peach sun

I have no way to know whether this be hoax or truth. My corrspondent who

I'm going to log off until i hear (via the media, I guess) better news.
Anyone needing to reach me, can do so at 707-664-4209. Leastwise, I will

Again, the story is this. You can't get a virus from email. You can get a
virus from downloading things like the freeaol, but you shouldn't do that.
If you get a Word Perfect or Word document, you might have macros embedded
in it that can cause problems.

Ordinary email has no problems at all. At one point, there were things
called ASCII-bombs, or email-bombs, but those holes have been filled years
ago.

You can send out an email message with escape codes that can change the
color of the type, and even create invisible type. If someone sends you a
message with an invisible type commmand, you might find your inbox
appearing oddly empty. But there's no damage at all when this happens; the
mail's still there and readable.

And that is about it. By the way, there's a minor sub-sub-field called I
believe steganography which is all about embedding secret texts in .gif or
.jpg files.

Dang, they found us (I mean me) out! But this just means that I claim
co-authorship of all those "Other people's" poems that Bromige owned up to.

On 12 August, Pete Landers wrote, referring back to the loyalty
thread and in reference to me:

Well, I never did "say" such a thing, but hurrah for Weiss and
Bromige on this issue. And not to beat a dead oath, but I do feel
there's something more worth saying here: No Constitutional scholar
me, but Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution states that in
cases of "rebellion," where the "public safety may require it," that
the writ of habeas corpus may be suspended (which would
effectively amount, of course, to cancelling any guarantees of
freedom of speech, press, association, etc. that the Constitution
enshrines). Thus we have a paradox, which Pete, so far as I can tell,
doesn't quite see, because he is adamant about only reading "the
words" of his oath "as they are" and not thinking about the
implications of those words in differing contexts.
  In other words, suspension of the Constitutional liberties that
Pete rightly holds so dear need not be Constitutionally construed
under certain extraordinary circumstances (a Civil War, for example,
or a "rebellious" challenge to the rule of capital) as at all
"unconstitutional." Thus, loyalty oaths that call on one to pledge
allegiance to the Constitution against domestic and other enemies do
not *necessarily* mean that one is pledging unqualified allegiance to
freedom of speech and of the press. "These may need to be," the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says to USA Today in
2027, "sacrificed under Constitutional law for an expedient time in
order to save the future of the Constitution."  Sort of like the
dictatorship of the proletariat, when you think about it, to ensure
the future of the greatest democracy of all, communism.
  Anyway, this is the unacknowledged potential contradiction I was
trying to point out to Pete with my revolutionary fantasy post,
written in a fit of syndicalist rapture and breathlessly, with not a
single comma. Maybe it was the lack of punctuation that angered Pete
so much and prompted him to start calling me a whatchamacallit. But I
asked the questions I asked because there were assumptions in Pete's
first reply to Charles Alexander that I found self-satisfied and
simplistic.
  Pete accuses me of illogic for asking what I asked; but I was
actually trying to point out (in my own idiosyncratic way) that
ideology sometimes reveals itself as most insidious inside the plain
words that seem most logical. That's an old one, but none of us can
remind ourselves of it too often.

Hello all,

Given the recent request for more poems, I thought it would only be
fitting to make my first post to the list a poem.


When she is gone, I say with certainty:
the sky has never cupped the sullen clouds
that never sighed as stars and moon would crowd
into the wild seclusion of her back;
the earth goes round the sun, all cats are black,
dark houses slump their shoulders under snow,
all shutters closed, the only birds are crows.
When she returns, Copernicus is wrong;
the warm loops of her walk move crows to song,
the rooflines straighten, cats dress themselves in white,
sheer curtains breeze on open-windowed nights,
as she lies here, and mumbles dreams to me.

Just to add briefly--people have been interested in DJ Renegade, a/k/a
Joel Dias-Porter--

Working with Kenny Carroll, he was one of the pioneering members of DC's
WritersCorps program, the only arts-related program of Americorps, which
put teachers of creative writing into DC schools, St. Elizabeth's, several
homeless shelters, and other places in need of "what is found there." DJ
helped put together an anthology of writings from the kids in the schools
where he taught. By all accounts, he enjoyed the hell out of it and so did
the kids.

I always thought Renegade would be an interesting person to design a font
for--something Bodoni-ish to start with, with the extreme stroke-weight
contrast, tall and a bit skinny (per the original), but with a rather '70s
roundness to the serifs and just enough trendy edge fragmentation to have
that urban look.

Mikhail Epstein has an interesting chapter in AFTER THE FUTURE on the
structure of ideological logic, or ideo-logic as he calls it.  It's
basically a win-win kind of power speech which Machiavellian-like
(& Orwell-like) plays off extreme positions against each other and
equates opposites, i.e.:

freedom - slavery
discipline - anarchy

Soviet communism would support socialist freedom over capitalist slavery but
proclaim socialist discipline against multi-party anarchy.  This is one of
the most basic "tetrads" which makes the Party master of the ideological
language field.  (Epstein, following many others, defines ideological
language as words which are inherently value-laden used without explanation
or proof [my own paraphrase here]).  The tetrads get much more subtle
and complicated.

I think the point Pete was emphasizing is that when faced by such a coercive
thing as an oath, we still have a choice.  It seems to me (based on my own
reaction & on several initial responses to Charles' first message) that
our FIRST reaction is, this is a case of repressive government intrusion.
What I found "astonishing" about Pete's response is that he opened up another
dimension to this situation - that is, we might actually support the
Constitution to the point of signing an oath to that effect. This does
not really occur to us when we take individual liberties for granted and
regard ALL government as an intrusion on the latter.  This attitude,
paradoxically, is just as much a prelude to tyranny as mindless
loyalty.  Pete's suggestion that we read what we're asked to sign onto
is a reminder that we are part of "da system", whatever form it takes,
& we bear some responsibility for the form it does take.

Poet Ruffles Feathers In Scotland With Record, MTV Deals

   By Jill Serjeant

   EDINBURGH, Aug 14 (Reuter) - With his long dark curly hair and frock
   coats, he looks like Britain's 19th century romantic poet Lord Byron.

   But that's about as far as the comparison goes for 28-year-old Murray
   Lachlan Young, a previously unpublished bard whose snappy verses about
   sex, drugs, and rock and roll are set to make him a millionaire.

   Young, an American-born Scot with a flair for the melodramatic, has
   taken the elitist world of poetry by storm by winning a $1.6 million
   deal with EMI Records and a $395,000 contract with MTV.

   The deals are unheard of in the world of British literature, where
   poets are still thought of as living in garrets, scraping a living
   from a lonely trade conjuring up pictures in the mind.

   Young, however, is one of the new breed of "performance poets," who
   declaims his contemporary verse to the sounds of a solo cello, seaside
   music or rock groups.

   EMI says it has never signed a poet before, but hopes Young's album
   "Vice and Verse" will sell about one million copies.

   "Taking on a new young artist is always a risk but we think he is a
   brilliant poet, a brilliant performer and very, very funny," said Tony
   Harlow, EMI marketing director.

   "He's three-dimensional. We could have sold him as a performer, as a
   stand-up comic or as a poet," Harlow said.

   Young's subject matter is perfectly attuned to the 1990s. One verse is
   about the Rolling Stones, another titled "Casual Sex," and in "Simply
   Everyone's Taking Cocaine" he satirises high society drugs culture.

   "Well I saw Aunt Milly in last season's clothes,

   She said car, house and yacht had gone straight up her nose.....

   Simply everyone's taking cocaine."

   He anounces his "MTV collection" of short verses aimed at the youth
   market as "no longer than 30 seconds, with no big words."

   APPEARANCE AT EDINBURGH FRINGE

   Staged to dramatic lighting and sound effects from a cello, Young is
   going down well with audiences at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe before
   he embarks on a series of "performance tours" in Britain and the
   United States.

   Fellow poets and some critics have not been so kind.

   The Financial Times called his work "puerile." Guardian newspaper
   critic Dan Glaister said his poetry failed to challenge the mind.

   "It is comforting, reaffirming stuff but there are no broader truths
   lurking beneath the whimsy," wrote Glaister.

   Established poets are skeptical, if not jealous, of the hype that has
   propelled Young to the front pages of newspapers and magazines.

   "For a new poet to land deals like this is unheard of. Much of it may
   be to do with marketing and hype and my instinct is to disapprove of
   the whole thing," said Peter Thorpe editor of the Poetry Review.

   Young, in performance as passionate and brooding as any
   self-respecting romantic poet should be, rejects the notion that he is
   all hype.

   "I'm trying to get an audience for poetry," he said. "Too often people
   who write poetry seem like they are divulging some terrible secret or
   slipping you something when you are depressed.

   "If you can show people interesting poems performed in a dynamic way
   then they might move on to Blake," Young said.

   But he is keenly aware of the pitfalls ahead of him. In a satirical
   poem written a year ago about another of Britain's much talked about
   artists -- Damien Hirst of dead sheep in glass boxes fame -- Young may
   unwittingly have written his own epitaph.

   "Whatever you do, whatever you are,

   Make sure that you never, never, never believe in your own PR."

yeah yeah. I might have read too sensitively. what was a question "what

hg, yes, but i'd have used first person singular because I know it's an
individual choice.

fwiw, writ of h.c. says they have to tell you why they stuck you in jail.
also, fwiw, the whole doc is amendable.

and as i say, it is/was a personal choice. i am not a patriot, per se, but
i'm damn glad TJ was there many years ago to balance the power freaks

but why so serious?

a virus in an email message is a persistant myth. *Not* possible. Please
lets not discuss here what's been debunked and blah-ed to death worldwide
for half a decade.

It is a sticky one, tho. I got an email message this spring from Harry
Mathews warning me that email with the subject "Good News" contained a
virus. That exact suggestion has come to me repeatedly over 3-4 years, like
a chain letter through my brain matter. I guess the repetition is the virus.

was the "original feel of 'avant garde'" that of an "advancing attack" as
Mark P. seems to be saying?

I *think* that militarily the avant garde would rather be scouts, or even
spies, rather than any kind of attack. Scouts checking out undiscovered

More appealing ideas than that of being cannon fodder. Or, as I so often

As you know, I posted the same conclusion, but ComputerWorld this week
discusses bugs in some email software, vis-a-vis IMAP and POP - this
doesn't affect your mail as far as I can tell, but does affect your
mailserver.

Subject:      dead oath drugs

I just received an e-mail from Eliot Weinberger, and he tells me
that during the Reagan days NEA recipients had to sign two oaths:
allegiance not to produce pornography or insult any (any) religion
and then also a separate promise not to take any drugs. Anybody out
there asked to sign one of these? I've never even applied for an NEA,
but if the above is the case, it makes the Constitutional
loyalty oath we've been talking about look pretty innocuous!
Weinbeger says *everyone* except two or three poets he knows who got a
grant in those eight years signed?

I don't know, if I'd gotten one of these, I may have well signed on
myself, hypocrite that I am, but holy cow, all of a sudden Pete
Landers looks like Bakunin.

I just wanted to say that I put in a little post last night and it
didn't go through. It was in response to Charles Alexander's
stunning image of George Bowering encased in light. I said in that
post that this was one of the most beautiful images I had ever
laid eyes upon, whatever that means. I just wanted for the record to
say this again. And also to say to George that I actually played
minor league ball too, though it was football--semi-pro, about $100
per game back in the early 80's for the Waukesha Hawks. Does that
count?

As I said, macro viruses are possible with Word Perfect and Word
documents; they don't come through standard ascii email. An attachment is
binary, 8-bit, not what's called lower ascii, 7 bit.

In my post referring to Eliot Weinberger's statement that only "two
or three poets" had refused to sign the terrible NEA pledge during
the Reagan years: I apparently got it wrong. The two or three people
who refused to sign during these years (the texts of the gov't
pledges are contained in EW's _Outside Stories_, pages 124-25) were
not poets but artists of other kinds. According to Weinberger, _all_
poets signed.

Now doesn't that make you feel like standing up and saluting the
flag?

On a similar note, if I recall correctly, there is involved in the process
of application for US citizenship a pledge/oath one must make stating that
one does not  support/believe in anarchy nor polygamy. Anyone know of
this, or am I recalling wrong?

In the spirit of James Finnegan's desire to have poets show their
process, here's a revision of an earlier piece I posted.  I got a lot of
help on this from Ike Kim.

Sounding Board

        for Alan

it is a good life though not
necessary.  now one hand smells
and one does not.  they have
been placed strategically

to peruse the meaning of
various holes.  no matter how many
you start out with the body
lays flat in its possible juices.  the ones
we eat are not necessarily the ones
we asked for--

there is no way to know.
it is too wet
        to get to the museum
but not to wet
        to go to the museum

it affects your consciousness,  act nasty
or get behind something you care nothing about.
later, you’ll laugh about it
on that uncomfortable futon
the best you can afford.

the problem with the bad half&half was
it made the coffee bad.  the same
can be said for sex.  certain combinations
are disaster for the consumer.
every member of the Happy Clubhouse
would tell you this,
but so far few have asked and
no one who’d do anything about it.

        *Helping them to help themselves.*

like I said, this began with a confusion
between money and memory.   indeed,
if you could hand me either,
I can assure you
it will be emptied though
righteousness is tenuous.
false memory, The GapÔ,
I can’t help stealing from big things
when they are costly.  bargain basements
hook me every time.

How long did you let it sit out?
How long must it be left out?
and if there is unrelenting rain, the possibilities.
in a flash flood you will lose things.

*Most victims didn’t buy flood insurance*
*No me quitas pas*

or as you were saying about the snow.
the amount of weight
the branch permits the leaves
to bear before it breaks.

there is much you can figure out
so take it upon yourself
to prevent certain events,
those labeled disaster.  logically,
what will happen to the previous losses
as they shift position
to the back of the general’s head.

as had happened through the epidemic.
we no longer considered them.  in the name of,
floods, borders, balanced books.

*I don’t want to argue about it.*

things are again shifted and look,
what we call your responsibility.
the Israelis are serious but
have redesigned the protocol.
his shirt burned off by the last blast,
he sits and waits, looking plainly bitter.
notice the watch, the numbers tattooed.
victimhood looks again, a face that aims
not for glamour yet is.   reconfigured, made so.
Ruptured protocol reemerges as successful,
as color, from black and white.

*There’s a Movement Underground*

photojournalism = journalism made history.
made hippies.  some mornings
I think I’m a happy person.
some words get printed. she’s a journalist
who also writes novels.

I can’t get past the game of it.
I ride in your back seat
[thinking][meditating][labeling][identifying][looking][like]
I’m staring out your window,
innocent, inocencia.  glamour. love or lose?
drunk with it he finally got silent,
then again, he was always silent.

Am not recalling this from my husband's application process, but he did
have to absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and
fidelity to any foreign prince or potentate, which is not difficult to
do after you've stopped laughing.

thanks, Kent

George and I continue to talk, and light probably plays a role in such
transmissions. Encased in light took on a new dimension last night, when I
went to an astronomer's birthday party at 8000-foot Mount Hopkins in the
Santa Rita chain, home of the Fred Whipple Observatory. This astronomer,
Dimitar Sassarov, is a pioneer theoretician -- one of the things he is
working on, and what brought him here, was the effect of microlensing, seen
once before and now again (and earlier predicted by him) that, when earth
and nearer star and far far distant star are in proper alignment, one can
see through the nearer star, and it will have a microscopic effect, making
the far far distant star appear large, allowing us to learn more about it
than we ever thought possible. Last night we used it and looked at a star
in the middle of the galaxy. Turned out that my family and Dimitar's
spouse, Sheila, were the only people at the birthday party and at the
telescopes.

What I didn't know until last night, as we also talked a bit of
linguistics, was that Dimitar is the nephew of structuralist and writer
Svetan Todorov. Language/poetics/astronomy/poets encased in light -- all
seems like a small world. We felt very priveleged last night.

alan yr plain brilliant.  --md
ps when i heard, a few years ago, legal scholar drucilla cornell talk about
reproductive rights and legal theory, she kept mentioning  --i thought
--chaka khan.  as in, "i don't think yr gonna get supreme court justices to
really pay attention to chaka khan."  about 15 minutes into the talk, from
context, as in, "the imaginary", "the symbolic," etc., i realized she meant
jacques lacan.  i kinda liked it the other way too.

I quite agree - to a point - with what was said - but only to a point

not very good - not long ago i found a file in my download directory wch

yes, you cannot get a virus via email as email,

everything going on is visible from your screen

it doesnt matter how the hell you got the virus when you have got it

the risks are small but they are there - it is possible the message i

Attachments _can_ cause problems.  (The rule of thumb is never open an
attachment from someone you don't know real well.)  But opening e-mail
can't.  Or couldn't... (I haven't seen ComputerWorld or the CERT advisory).

She should not have to do this.  I hope this shames everyone who has not
already contributed into contributing something, and not in exchange for
anything.

Judy, while I totally understand your sentiments about how Bernadette
shouldn't have to do anything to receive help, I do not think that people
who haven't given should be shamed.  That's a personal decision and
everyone has different circumstances.  And this opinion is from a household
who *has* sent money to the fund.

Chuck Shepherd's WEIRDNUZ.491 (News of the Weird, July 4, 1997) --
his latest weekly email dispatch of the popular true-story column --
includes this:

> * In December, a man from southern England named Nigel paid
> about $128,000 at a London auction for the personalized license
> plate "N1 GEL."  Eighty other plates brought in about $2.7 million.
> A month before that in London, the much less wealthy Dave Parker
> spent about $40 to have a plate matching his name:  He paid a filing
> fee to change his name legally to [Mr.] C 539 FUG, which is his
> current license plate.

This astonishing pairing of info-bits gives pause.  What is this
craze for unity of self & license plate?  Does the license plate lend
reality to the else drifting soul?  What's the deal here?

The same issue of News of the Weird also includes this:

> * The Globe and Mail (Toronto, Ontario) reported in February that
> local physician Ron Charach, who is the author of a volume of poems
> by Canadian doctors, recently had one of his works selected to be
> published in the prestigious British medical journal, The Lancet.
> The title of the poem is the same as the last two words in this
> passage:  "In silence after heavy rain / you can hear prostates
> growing."

who'd think that The Lancet would (finally) go postmod?

And a 3rd item from same:

> * In a brief interview published in Fortune magazine in February,
> Todd Sloane, a marketing executive with Publishers Clearing House
> (the $10 million sweepstakes people) was asked whether entrants
> worry that the PCH prize patrol can't find them if they win: "We get
> thousands of calls from entrants warning us their house is hard to
> get to [or] they'll be at Uncle Jack's, whatever."

(Strangely, it didn't occur to me to send such a helpful chit to the
Yale Series of Younger Poets) --

Finally, truly weird news:

> * In April, Sir Roger Penrose, a British math professor who has
> worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity, black
> holes, and whether time has a beginning, filed a copyright-
> infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which
> Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating
> that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex
> quilted toilet paper.  Penrose said he doesn't like litigation but,
> "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a
> multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work
> of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken."

(& perhaps Pollock shd. have sued drip-prone housepainters . . . ?)

Dear List,
        Bernadette Mayer loves assignments and it would be no problem for
her to "write to specification"- in fact she thrives from rising to other
people's lists of Experiments - I just hope someone keeps track of all the
poems she writes for money.  I think it'll also be good for her writing
"recovery"- she'll take it seriously and produce all the more poems.
         And isn't writing poems what many poets would like to be paid for
rather than scrubbing floors or teaching comp?  Yeah, I know, who pays the
piper calls the tune but Bernadette will subvert with a vitriolic pen
swathed in sexy dailiness anyday any attempt at unwelcome directional
content.
        She's a great writer of  occasional verse, raising the form to new
heights.  I highly recommend her if you have any special occasions coming
up- for as one Experiments from the (expanded) list of experiments reads:

  "Write occasional poems for weddings, for rivers, for birthdays, for
other poets' beauty, for movie stars maybe, for the anniversaries of all
kinds of loving meetings, for births, for moments of knowledge, for
deaths."

and that's only one of her long list!

        The last one says:

"Please add to this list."

so if you give her "specifications" it's like throwing Brer Rabbit in the
briarpatch.

        Maybe the poems should be posted on the net held up for all to
scrutinize if they are in any way compromised by filthy lucre.  ('Only
fooling' as Bernadette would say.)  But not about the posting part.

Love,

Lee Ann

PS: You can give me assignments too.

I want to thank everyone from the Poetics list that took part in our
discussion on Web del Sol tonight. I apologize to those who may have
wanted to get on but could not. We had no idea how many the chat room
would hold. To clear up some loose ends; the book which I referenced
("increasingly ambitious dialogue with modernism") in response to the
question about John Ashbery was Charles Altieri's Self and Sensibility
in Contemporary American Poetry. Douglas Hofstadter is critical of John
Cage's music on at least two occasions in Goedel, Escher, Bach. Finally,
I do not want to leave anybody with the impression that I consider
Robert Peters' criticism astute. I find it eratic and superficial. Again
thanks.---Carlo Parcelli

Dear Mark

Yes please send me that signed book back. I'll send you another. I have to
take better care of what gets on the bookshelves around here.

As to talking about design, or anything else, about that and other books,
yes, let's do it.

This week I'm likely to be in the studio from 9am or so (I think we're in
the same time zone as you until daylight savings time exits the scene, and
then we're an hour later than you, as Arizona never changes for the
daylight savings) until nearly 2pm. Then on some of these days I'll be
picking up Kate (school started today), and on other days I'll be staying
later at the studio. Most nights we're home. I know you have both numbers,
but here, anyway --

520 620 1626  studio
520 321 1811  home

take care,

charles

Good as it is, this last bit appears to have been the utterance of
Penrose's lawyer, not Penrose himself, according to other news
stories.

I am sorry to report that this toilet paper is not sold in the United
States.  I would be interested in talking with anyone who's going to
the UK soon and has large amounts of free space in their luggage.

I dont know. I guess i can see that people can love playing football, and I
remember the first time I saw it, age 17, in Victoria down from the sticks,
it seemed a neat magic game. In the 50s and 60s i went to some football
games, and even later saw some on TV, but the longer I  have looked the
less interesting I have found football, and the NFL on TV is just, agh, I
cant be bothered. I know that Shelley and Keats wouldnt have gone to a
foo'ball game, but they would have gone to baseball games, as for instance
the Venice Hawks vs. the Trieste Red Sox.

Here's why Penrose tilings are neat.  The shapes look very simple and
natural, it is not at all obvious just glancing at a Penrose tiling that it
is deeply strange.

But there is no need to go to England.  You can make your own Penrose
tiling toilet paper, wallhanging, etc. --- Penrose tilings have been
written up in places like Discover, Scientific American, etc.

George:
I don't want to take up space that otherwise would be taken up with
the discussion about poems (or, more importantly, with actually true
to life poems separate from the talking about them), but I just have
to ask: How do you know that Keats and Shelley would not have wanted
to go to football games? There are lots of boys there at football
games (at least in the American kind--I don't know about the fake
CFL, even though I was invited once to try out for the Edmonton
Argonauts), who pat each other lovingly on the behind.

Well, there is a team called the Edmonton Eskimos and a team called the
Toronto Argonauts. It happens that they are right now each in first place
in their divisions.

I think you should have muscled up and gone to the Washington Steelers
camp, Kent.

alright now I'm going out on a limb here like on mt sinai and the kids
coming up told us kids coming down that thurmon munson had died and
larry was going crazy with grief and i thought he couldn't be serious
and he nearly punched me.  so i know i don't know what you guys are
going crazy about and i don't want to insult anyone cause i am the kind
of gal that guys might be provoked to punch but if you would, could you
bring it to a level that would be enjoyable for those of us that are
used to other forms of contact?

JOHN CAGE CELEBRATION TO BE HELD IN MARYLAND SEPTEMBER 5TH

"AtlantiCage Ninety-seven^85: A Birthday Circus for John Cage" will be
presented on September 5th, 1997 at 8 PM at the Tawes Fine Arts
building on the campus of the University of Maryland at College Park.
The event is free and open to the public.

The celebration, organized by members of "Silence: The John Cage
Internet Mailing List", will include performances and reading of
works by Cage, as well as performances inspired by his work and life.
In keeping with his principles of peaceful anarchism, the event will
include simultaneous performances of different works, as well as
related visual and sound events. It is presented as part of the
worldwide "Freedom Summer" series in conjunction with the Pauline
Oliveros Foundation.

The event will begin on the brick stage on the north side of Tawes
Theater (to the left of the theatre as you face it) with a Tuning
Meditation, followed by a listening walk through the area, arriving at
Room 2102 of the Tawes Fine Arts Building where the rest of the events
will occur.

Bring yourself and an open ear. If you'd like to contribute to the
reception afterwards, food donations are appreciated.

Directions:

Maps:
     For the official map, see the University web page at
http://www.inform.umd.edu/CampusInfo/About_UMCP/Maps/ and click on
the Southwest Quadrant.
    For alternate directions, see
http://www.inform.umd.edu/CVS/.CVS/gettingtocampus.html


By Car:
     The University of Maryland sits right in the corner of the
intersection of 193 (University Blvd.) and Adelphi Rd.
     From either direction on 495, take the College Park exit
(Rt. 1 south) and head south on Rt. 1 through several traffic lights.
After a few miles, you will see signs for 193 west, which will be a
right exit down a ramp. Take this exit, continue west through one
traffic light. The next traffic light will be Campus Drive, on which
you will turn left and enter the campus. Stay to your right, going
through the traffic circle and keeping to your right. You will go
between the construction for the Maryland Center for the Performing
Arts on your right, and a huge parking garage (behind which is the
stadium) on your left. Soon, you'll reach a second traffic circle,
through which you pass, still staying to the right and going straight.
A soccer field will be on your right, and the next stop sign you get
to, turn left.
     The large parking lot that is now to your right is Lot 1,
and Tawes Theatre looks west across it. Park in Lot 1 (it's open to
visitors without a permit after 4 PM on weekdays), and walk
towards the theatre, and you should see us gathering out on a brick
stage in a small courtyard next to the theatre entrance. The main
building entrance is actually on the opposite side of the building,
and the room for the performance (2102) is on the second floor.

By Public Transportation:
     The College Park Metro is not really within walking distance of
Tawes; there are shuttles that run from the station to campus, or
you can take a cab. Tawes is at least a mile or two from the
Metro station.

Karen M. Sorry you missed the discussion. It was posted on the Poetics
sight; but it was also posted on 300 other poetry, literature,
philosophy and philosophy of science sites. We opened with a discussion
of the post-Lowell confessional school with a focus on the critical
works of Charles Altieri. However, Joe Brennan participated in the
discussion and we eventually moved into a scrap about L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
poetry. As I tried to move the discussion toward the dominance of the
scientific paradigm, we wound up talking about the phenomenonology of
Husserl and Natorp, Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle and the Frankfurt
School---among other things. At one point, half the chat was on Freud
and Lacan and the other half on the potential of modernist poetics to
critique the scientific-technological paradigm. I still have a headache.
Needless to say such a discussion in the chat format is hard to
economize. We plan to do it again and hope to have our mechanics down
better next time.---Carlo Parcelli

Interesting choice of word, Rachel. Now, while we are speaking of levels,
we have to speak of higher and lower, dont we? When you say "bring it to a
level", do you mean raise it to a higher level, by any chance? Now, in the
study of language usage, that is called "begging the question," i.e. in
this case pretending that we agree that a disagreement about the value of
football is necessarily on a lower level than something that can be
"enjoyed" by others. Unless you meant, which I doubt, that you wanted
something at a lower level....

ATTENTION POETS/ACTIVISTS!!

Rachel Levitsky and Matt Meighan (2 subscribers) are currently
organizing the 1997/98 Literary Segment of the Left Hand Reading Series
in Boulder, Colorado.

There are still some slots unfilled for the readings January through
April, 1998.  Because we cannot pay poets (though can bring them the
attention of a sizable audience, and a well-promoted event) we are
dependent on the poet's proximity to us.  If you or a poet you know
lives in the area, or will be in the Denver/Boulder area during that
time and would like to read please contact us:

Rachel Levitsky -- Levitsk@ibm.net
Matt Meighan -- mmeighan@rmii.com

Also, writers who are interested in being featured reader can send work
to:     Rachel Levitsky
        LHRS
        P.O. 1771
        Boulder, CO  80306-1771


MORE READING SERIES INFORMATION
        The Reading Series is a program of the Left Hand Book
Collective, an all volunteer run radical left bookstore.
        The series was begun last year and was a huge success.  Writers
Rikki Ducornet, Dennis Brutus, Akilah Oliver, Andrew Schelling, Carolyn
Wright, Ward Churchill, Bunky Echo Hawk, Max Regan, Shira Segal, Geri
Lynn Baumblatt, Sarah Skaggs, Stephanie Williams and others read to
enthusiastic audiences.
        Each reading features an open segment and two featured readers,
one emerging writer and one established writer.  We are committed to
promoting work that might otherwise be marginalized, and make a special
effort to reach out to young writers, writers of color, writers of
diverse economic and social backgrounds and to writers of daring and
innovative forms.  We see no separation between art and politics.

now you'll hate me but I'm on a trip, now in Pittsburg on the way to
everywhere, so, well, this came out, ahem, definitely the work, ah, of
a beginner, someone reading, whom, maybe even Blackburn played a role
here, certain not the language poets, Rachel got me to read some Jane
Miller standing up in a bookstore, well, I did that on my own, but now
going through Lacan who's not much help here either, so now you'll hate

Plural Dark Angels of the Night


You came to me like plural dark angels of the night.
I was about to compose a brilliant text on the density of my language.
I began thinking of your brilliant arrival a month ago, like plural
   dark angels of the night.
My language dissolved like sloppy seconds at my feet (I'm not gonna
   have no feet).
I wanted to reply about this, the nature of language and brilliant feet.
I wanted to write about languages interspersed, interpenetrated in this
   machine, languages and information everywhere, like plural dark angels
   of the brilliant sloppy night.
I thought of our arms like grapple-hooks around each other.
Language clattered like a bowl of boiling coffee spilled on my feet.
I thought of our teeth against brilliant skin confused with passion like
   plural dark angels of the night.
There was something else I wanted to write; I thought of your brilliant
   eyes.
I wanted to write about your eyes; I thought of your brilliant mouth, your
   limbs.
I thought about the feet of the plural dark angels of the night.
I thought, I thought.
I thought, brilliant, you know where this is going so I'm not gonna write
   no more.

(Something along these lines went out to the list two days ago, but my

volatile language from the original. Kent)

George:
You think you flame me. But the invitation to the pre-season camp
from Edmonton was many years ago, and the fact is I just don't give a
damn about Canadian football, since it is such a sorry state of
affairs. You Canadians are pretty pathetic: You still haven't
really rid yourselves of the Queen, and then like cowbirds you take
up football and then baseball, and then all of a sudden you think you
can tell true past players of these games what the score is. Eskimos
or Argonauts, who gives a shit? They are both really stupid names
anyway, almost as stupid as "Maple Leafs," which is a really silly
name. I meant to say Eskimos and I said Argonauts. So what George? I
was cut after a couple weeks, but this was only because of the
receiver coach who felt I was too light to play tight end and too
heavy to play wide-out. He was a CAnadian, boring and affable on the
outside, scheming and manipulative on the inside. So what sport do
you play, George? Curling? Don't mess with me.

It's the same Paul Auster. He discusses this translation during

Kent, what is wrong with you? Why are you so pissed off? I never tried to
flame you.
If you were serious with your question, I play fastball, a version of
softball that is more exciting than that slo-pitch game they play south of
the border, and related to baseball, a game they were playing in Ontario in
1836. Oh, and the first football game was played in Kingston, Ont.

A word of mourning from me:

I was just thinking of Nancarrow the week before he
died, drawing inspiration from his piece - is it "x" or
"zeugma"? - where the "left hand" of the player piano starts
playing very slowly, ascending and speeding up and the
"right hand" plays ludicrously quickly, descending and
slowing down. They meet in the middle and cross and finish
at their far extremes. It is a piece of such simple audacity
that it delights anyone I know, pop or classical or
whatever their musical tastes. I was writing a libretto
for a piece by MIke Higgins - the score of Bach's first
Prelude from the Well Tempered Clavier played upside down,
hence "I edulerp" (Prelude I) as the title and I
used a poem of two-word lines with the ultimate
line read first, then the first, then the penultimate,
then the second, and so on, crossing in the middle.
The columns should work separately and together. The theme
was a Gaia of Gaia's: just as all life and the planet
may be one organism, so may all its history also make
a gaia. It seems to strike by fluke a note of eternity,
the fields Beckett describes in Stirrings Still, which
honour life and see some hope in death, so I'll offer it in
memory of Nancarrow:

Exact Change has just published Auster's _Translations_ ($16.95) including
Tomb for Anatole, as well as Joubert, Andre Dubouchet, & Philippe Petit. I
believe Anatole was originally published by North Point. Also, if you don't
know it Auster's anthology _The Random House Book of Twentieth Century French
Poetry_ is well worth getting, I believe it's still in print.

While we're talking just published Michael Davidson's U. Cal. tome _Ghostlier
Demarcations: Modern Poetry and the Material World_ ($35) is just out.
Discusses Stein, Oppen, Howe, Pound, Olson, Zukofsky, Rukeyser, Reznikoff,
Duncan, &&&.

Also new & excitin': _Guy Debord -- Revolutionary: A Critical Biography_
($14.95) by Len Bracken. It's not that critical (of Debord) but neither am I.
Way recommended.

All of these will be on next Bridge Street list but ya'll kin order'm now if
ya needta.

As this fellow once said to me, "The hell with the pansies, what can you =
do with it?"

Well, my 'test market' reports to me that he's had a 40% boost in sales =
(for the one or two cynics in this group, I don't doubt that he drives a =
Mercedes, long ago paid his mortgage and has his sere threads done by =
the comely seamstress with the magical fingers - not that she'd ever =
given me the nod, but then I only brought in my pants cuffs to be taken =

Kent, that wasnt flaming (unless george back channeled you). George wouldnt
flame a fly. Thats just George's notion of good fun & friendliness. Honest.
We've all put up with that for decades. When you meet soneone as
developmentally challenged as George Bowering, you only encourage him,
because its just great that he can interact at all, after all those years
growing up in the desert.

Btw, when you wrote that you didnt give a damn abt canadian things, I was
really hoping the text was going to say "rats ass." "I dont give a rats ass
about canadian things." Am i the only listling who prefers "rats ass" to
"damn"? David

David Bromige now turns to favored forms of expressing umbrage
(or disinterest at least) -- saying to Kent Johnson,

<< Btw, when you wrote that you didnt give a damn abt canadian things, I was really hoping the text was going to say "rats ass." "I dont give a rats ass about canadian things." Am i the only listling who prefers "rats ass" to "damn"? >>

I won't personally weigh in in favor of rat's ass; somehow (notwithstanding the agreeable hint of the archaic), the presumed appeal of this locution eludes me at present.

What other forms of not-caring -- what rhetoric of i-cd-care-less -- are prevalent, rare, favored, or even of-the-moment?

I've somewhat admired
   >  I don't give a flying fuck . . .  <

(though will not admit to having used the expression much meself).

One feels certain that this redoubtable roster must have up its collective sleeves many more (& better) alternatives, neh?

d.i.

No.  I too prefer it.  In fact, rats ass is best flamed (or broiled).

Whoa. Is it me? Am I actually the one missing double entendres in the
last posts, letting me know, ever so subtly, that every one is
kosher and just playing back with moi? Well, I have to admit, listers,
that I am more confused than
I even normally am. George and David (the Canadians) and even a few
Americans (among the very few Americans on this list) seem to have
taken me awrongs. In fact, this is very interesting, and I'd like to
propose it is worth at least a new and separate thread (tho I doubt
it would come to that). Is
it possible, really, that such intelligent people could have thought
that my football post to George was seriously meant? That I actually
thought he was trying to "flame" me with his previous post? I have to
say, this seems very similar to Sokal all over again, even though I
never intended it that way. I sincerely thought that the silliness
would be obvious. I mean I've never even (and I swear here) been to
Canada. (although my past in football is more or less real--I was
actually captain of the UW/LaCrosse freshman football team, then
broke my hand and went to UW/Milwaukee to play soccer. My substitute
at tight end on the football team in '74 went on three years later to
become NAIA All-American, a tid-bit that remains one of the proudest
accomplishments of my life to this day.)

Anyway, I just wanted to make this clear, and to apologize to George
and David for insulting their motherland. I was just kidding. In
fact, I have to say, it's fascinating that when I told David Bromige
some days back that I had had an encounter of the third kind that he
thought I was kidding when in truth I was absolutely serious, and
then when I told George that I was a better football player than he
he thought I meant it when I was thoroughly kidding. This email
business is slippery. Who can keep
track? I'm reminded of my teacher Samu Sunim, who stared at me once
like he was a tiger about to bite my entrails out and said: "Bring me
the thoughts in these words, and put them in my hand." There's
something there relevant to to this medium, but I'm not sure what.

I will now stop posting prose and stick to poems where there is
never any problem with what anybody says. I'm serious George, you
Canuck.
Kent

Kent, I don't really give a fuck, I just wanted to know if that was what =

I'm much relieved - for which I don't give a rusty fig, either. Now, =
about that "tid-bit" bit, that's a loose ball. Frankly I've always liked =
'a dinkle-berry' in that stead, or maybe its 'I don't give a =

actually, I couldnt tell were you for real or not on this one (unlike yr
other postings ahem). But i saw the chance to say insulting things about my
old friend while appearing to rush to his defense; it was too good to
waste. George would have done no less for me.

Apparently, a majority enjoy their rats ass flamed. Charles writes a neat
poem in which by the last line I am his old flame while he states his
preference for rats ass. Thats nice. I remember the Alexander piano--shaky,
unstable, but downright seductive. Unless thbat was me (the first
part).There should be more fun in one's life.

David I., I _knew_ you were going to "say" "flying fuck" before my eye
reached it, I swear. Long a favorite of mine, though its vehemence undoes
its indifference. Other phrases to indicate indifference? I used to like
the ungrammatical "I could care less." (Cant even be bothered to add the
"n't"). "Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn." Sexist pig. "Good goddam"
is a pleasure to say. "Two hoots" sounds archaic--back to a time when owls
flew this earth. "A tinker's cuss" has a pleasingly ethnic tint. Any
others?

david,

i love the phrase "I don't give a rats ass"  And i agree that "I don't give
a flying fuck" is another good one. like in the movie "DOWN BY LAW" where
roberto benigni walks around with his list of american phrases to be spoken
in broken english. he gets thrown in the hoosegow and looks at his notes
and yells out at the jailer "why don't you take a flying fuck next to a
couch!" (at least that's how i remember it, i never remember these things
right)

My dad used to say, while driving, "That guy drives like he's got a paper
asshole." And of course there's another favorite: "candy-ass". i don't use
these phrases but they always crack me up when i hear them.

don

Subject:      space(s) of silence
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

on silence(s)

mouth opens. words flow forward.        silence(s)               between
each word,              each breath,            e
a       c       h       l       e       t       t       e       r       .
these silences form a bubble infinitely larger than the spoken.
silences               take             up              space. silences
emerge during the spoken.
when we think of silence(s) we think of mouths, of breath seen in cold air,
of dead phone lines, of discomfort, of too much comfort, of death. writing
is scarred with the death of silences. writing is scarred with death.
writing is scarred with silence. these silences are full. we read between
the lines to find 'truth'. silences are impatient. silences are already
written.
the everlasting silence of suicide notes and love letters.
beside my corpse lies my last words. between the lines          lies my body.

your absence  is filled with your voice your body more than your presence.
the further away you are, the less you speak, the more i hear your silence
around my throat.


on having nothing to write

i have nothing to write.  i have nothing to say. yet, i write:
'i have nothing to write'.
'it' all resides within the space(s) of silence. these silence(s) must be
written.
what is the condition of these spaces of silence?
this is not so much about writing about silence as it is about writing
through/to silence, finally, writing silence.
silence is not empty nor passive. we recognize silence as one of the most
effective tools of communication. to communicate our anger/frustration we
'use' the 'silent treatment' upon the other.
silence(s) are moody.



how to write silence : this is my dilema,

any blanchot fans out there?

oh, and by the way,

Well, shoot, Red, even though it's in the form of prose, I meant it
all as poesy. Are you implying that you don't like it? Well,
pardner, there it is. Don't let it get under your big-buckled belt
_too_ much. It's only poetry.

By the way, is that really your name, "Red Slider"? that's pretty
cool. Did you know there used to be a coach in the very early years
of the old AFL named Red Hickey? Funny how everything, in the end, can
be brought back to football.

how to write silence : this is my dilema,

Kim, neither Rachael's nor Christina's samples seem to solve the problem =
for me. They both have big flashing noisey signfiers - =
END-OF-TEXT***END-OF-TEXT - waving at the ends of their texts. This I =
think we are clever enough (or cynical enough) to quit when it has the =
look&feel of 'END-OF-TEXT'. The trick is known, the audience eats the =
rabbit.

My own samples weren't much more useful. I don't pour much concrete =
poetry so they all were samples of textual, rather than meta-textual, =
silence. Missing term representations, grammatical or semantic =
discontinuities, unfulfilled or unresolved context or heightened =
anticipation. None would satisfy your request for meta-textual =
representation of silence. I did learn the following from considering =
the problem (at least as very tentative hypotheses):

1) the problem of representing 'silence' in text is catagorically =
similar to background/forground problems - a matter of degree, of terms =
in contrast, not in absence.

2) the simple presence of meta-symbols for 'silence' (space, empty =
enclosure, etc.) may serve to intensify subject rather than signify =
silence. The very act of calling attention to noiseless areas may =
immediately fill with all kinds of noise signified by the surrounding =
context - not 'silence' but a container for surplus noise.

3)  'Silence' may be a misnomer - or, at any rate, their may be a =
multiplicity of 'types of silence' so that any attempt to find a =
universal representation for 'silence' qua 'silence' is hopeless. Each =
will only be come as still as its particular context permits and in a =
way which its own formula will depend on that context.

4) It may be that 'Silence' is some kind of counter-effect that we can =
create - in meaning, in meta-graphical representation, in juxtaposition =
in which elements mutually annihilate each other - are 'phased' in such =
a way that each is muted. Whether this can approach 'silence' i don't =
know.=20

in a poem I posted here recently, there are two lines:
                     =20
                           stars the size of raindrops

raindrops the size of stars


both sentences wanted to make there own noisey statments. I find them to =
be considerably muted in this arrangement - and some kind of silence =
leaking into the margins.

I do not think concrete representations (as opposed to textual ones) =
escape this dilemma. Even physical impositions which forces interruption =
in the reader (page-breaks, double page-breaks (though here the =
'silence' of the publisher is quite audible), abrupt sequence reversal =
(say, right-to-left), etc. ) still seem to be referrential, i.e. noisey.
A true 'silence' would be absolutely stunning!

I propose these notions from examining only a very few of my own =
materials and hardly a hard proposal. Like to hear if you find anything =
quiet enough and universal enough to meet your needs.
END

my father being dead too, i can't supply his meaning exactly... but
whenever he said to me, twinkle in his eye

"joe, you talk like a man with a paper asshole"

i took him to mean that i was full of SHIT...

i might venture some apt readings of this saying in anatomical or
gastrointestinal terms, speculating as to the way a paper asshole might
function vis-a-vis the fleshy variety, but---if you look in the harper/row
_american slang_ dictionary, you'll find the following under "man with a
paper ass":

"n phr black [african-american dialectical] a person whose ideas are not
important; a trivial man; = lightweight"

presumably "ass" here functions synecdochically for the person in question
-- the lightweight -- so i assume asshole, being part of an ass, functions
similarly...

George, I thank you and the Society for the
Spellingly and Grammatically Disadventiged
thanx you.

I try my best but the list welcome message said
to be careful because some posts were not so
well thought out. I'm trying my best not to
contribute to that mayhem by making all of
my posts absolutely brilliant. I think there is
some principle of cathexis involved. The speling

And while were in the general neighborhood, perhaps someone can enlighten me on the origin and nuance of the
term 'asshole buddies'. I've a close friend you employs
that expression frequently and I finally got the courage to
ask him to stop because it always left a bad aftertaste. After
seeing just how complex the taxonomy of assignments for
scatalogical kinship terms is, I worry that perhaps I have
hastily disemboweled my friendship, or at least thoughtlessly
evacuated some of its finer mesh.

my father being dead too, i can't supply his meaning exactly... but
whenever he said to me, twinkle in his eye

"joe, you talk like a man with a paper asshole"

i took him to mean that i was full of SHIT...

i might venture some apt readings of this saying in anatomical or
gastrointestinal terms, speculating as to the way a paper asshole might
function vis-a-vis the fleshy variety, but---if you look in the harper/row
_american slang_ dictionary, you'll find the following under "man with a
paper ass":

"n phr black [african-american dialectical] a person whose ideas are not
important; a trivial man; = lightweight"

presumably "ass" here functions synecdochically for the person in question
-- the lightweight -- so i assume asshole, being part of an ass, functions
similarly...

sorry for the unbroken lines. linefeeds were showing here

have manual returns and should be ok.

this line is a wrap around line and should be ok also now that the fix has

David Chirot's                s  e  e

comes close to what we can do in text
indicating presence through absence, deletion
embodying even more silence (Can silence be embodied?
Do we want to create such a form to hold the something that is nothing?)
than Eugene Gomringer's poem "silencio" in the Emmett Williams' anthology

yet text and silence are two streams that can never cross
though we can have one hand in each
(Would we feel the waters of silence on our fingers? Now I'm disarranging
my senses.)

I noisily remember Geoff Huth has considered this conundrum
in much of his writing, including columns on "praecisio"
(Bob Grumman should be able to help me remember with the accuracy silence
deserves)

Subject:      how to raise funds for yr reading/lecture series
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Last weekend, the "Friends of West County," an ad hoc environmental group
dedicated to preventing an industrial park being built on land the city
council voted to annex (contra various laws of their own making), held our
second yard sale,sat-sun, and raised nearly $4000. In the spring, we raised
over $3000. (This money goes towards the attorney's fees for the court
action we are bringing).

It occurred to me that other groups than environmentalists should know
about this source of funds. All it takes is a site (we used a small parking
lot attached to a building where one of us has a business), people to
donate stuff (& to encourage persons not in the group to donate stuff),
some plywood resting on sawhorses to be tables, and some flyers &
handpainted signs. It takes some time, sure--I'd estimate I spent 3 hours
in planning meetings, an hour signmaking, a couple hours sorting out my own
junk to donate, another hour picking up junk from other people, and five
hours in toto helping man the cashbox.

  So say 12 hours. Out of my busy schedule, etc etc, but well worth it, not
only because it cleared junk out of our garage here, but for the end
result, and also for the camaraderie and community of the event.(I got some
more books, too--O joy![as was it Ren or Stimpy would say?] And some nifty
tapes and record albums...somebody's Nina Simone collection, for
starters--so, junk gets recycled.)

The core of our group is fewer than 20 persons--comparable with a number of
groups or collocations of poetry fans in many centers throughout the
continent. You too could do this and have 3 grand to play with. Enough to
fly in those poets you want to hear but the administrators/fat-cat
professors of your local college/art center/library _don't_ want you to.
And something left over to pay your visiting poet a couple hundred. Ask me
if you want to know more.

PS Red Slider? Ren & Stimpy is/was a cartoon on tv i found pretty
disgusting but watched plenty of because at that time my daughter & her
friends were crazy for it. A dog and a cat. Tongues hung way, way out;
eyeballs shot way, way out on stalks; there was vomit, there was crap,
intimidation, bondage, violence, and above all, weird sounds/voices. When
will it go into reruns?!

Hey, Brom, there you go with your cultural cringe again. Why didnt you
mention that Ren & Stimpy was drawn by a guy in Vancouver?

Accordingly, I'll add it to the thread.  Red Slider also had some
lines, but it's not clear to me if any (or which) were intended to be
part of a group renga, . . . so I don't know how to deal with those.
Possibly his is  the original line also?  (Am not sure of the initial
(metronome) author) --

in any case, here's the Renga-so-far according to my best light; shd.
be happy if it proceeds -- which can easiest / best be done by
copying only the Renga lines (from this post) & adding on another
-- if any shd. careto do so . . .

Could you put the address on the list?  In most places it's hard finding

To fill in just a little about what Crag said about Geof Huth, his
fine series of columns on the praecisio ran in Lloyd Dunn's much-missed
magazine *Photostatic* as the eighties ended.  A praecisio is the
absence of some stimulus where expected, to define it very loosely from
a shaky memory of what Geof wrote.  Cage's silences were prototypes of
it--and such things as books titled THE WIT AND WISDOM OF RONALD REAGAN
that contained nothing but blank pages.  Geof got into a good deal more
than this, but I'm too lazy to look it up.

Now that I've been lured into this thread, I might as well say that I
think both Dave Chirot and Kim Dawn succeeded in capturing silence in
their recent pieces.  It seems to me that visual poetry is ideal for
this purpose--and that blank areas of a page, being textless, are
clearly as SILENT as a pause in the oral telling of a story.  That
either a blank area or a pause might cause noisy THOUGHTS is irrelevant
because silence is that which causes a PERCEPTION of soundlessness
regardless of whether it also causes noisy thoughts.  If this weren't
the case, then no kind of silence would be possible, since somewhere
there's going to be someone who's going to think noisy thoughts about
any possible silence.

I think the real question is what silences are EFFECTIVE silences in
poetry.  I like visual poetry's silences; Red Slider, I guess, doesn't.
Here's one of my own attempts at an effective silence in a poem.  I'll
make the blank area short: in the book I have it in, it lasts three
pages:

                            pnd;



















                                               then, at last,
                                             the splash of
                                                something

Hello--

I'm attempting to hunt down a particular quote from Roland Barthes,
something to the effect of "words are exchanged for ideas, as money is for
goods."  Since I'm brand new to Barthes' writing, I'm not sure where to
look for this. Any leads would be highly appreciated. Backchannel is fine.

many thanks--

<ir> wow. I mean, this really silences me. I'm still thinking about it.
I think Bob is right.
And I think Dave and Kim might well consider embarking on this
wonderful and thought-filled journey.
Dave, Kim ... how about some postings to the EPC list that have ...
that have no sender, no subject,and NO MESSAGE !!
Is this maybe too much silence to ask? It would be like Rimbaud in Harar

red is writing:

yes indeed. When scuba-diving i find it is the absence of bird sounds that
most impress me with the utter silence around me. In my earlier post I
think that's what I was scratching at - that we're somehow dealing with
contrast-space rather than object-space, which means Bob Grumman's central
question about which portrayals of silence will be effective - create the
precise praeciscios desired - will have multiple solutions - arrangements
of textualized white-space being one (and that there are many types of
textualized white-space, I have no doubt). So what will be useful, will
help at the margin of the process is a description of the tools and what
they seem to be doing in varying circumstances. The idea of types of
'phasing' of mutual elements so that their interplay appears to cancel or
reduce 'noise' is of the most interest to me at the moment.

Ach, what to do?  I see that Douglas Barbour and Maria Damon have
*both* added on a 6th line to the Renga for Nancarrow.  Since it
appears that DB's follows clearly from the 5th (the "its" referring
back, one assumes, to the "thermal etude" of line 5 -- which in turn
presumably may refer back to "the music" of line 3), will Maria
concede line 6 to Prof. B, and accept 7th line as hers?  Maria also
suggests abandoning the numbering & i.d.'ing of lines.  okay w/ me.

Here's now adding an 8th.   (So far, I find this reading fairly in
couplet-fashion -- though other readers might read otherwise.)

Perfect or absolute silence would be a kind of vacuum, wouldn't it? And
nature abhors a vacuum.

Or nature adores a vacuum, since it rushes right into it . . .

Now that the light at the end of the rat's ass seems to be turned off, I
have a phrase that's always puzzled me, 2wit&var:

"You're a real piece of work."

I've generally heard it used in a disapproving mode - with harmonics in the
'piece of shit'  or 'piece of tail' range. But, frankly find the euphonics
rather and strangely pleasant and employ it affectionately when, say, I
might step back from a 'piece' i'm pleased with and remark ().

Then again, it might be the diminutive 'piece of' to which the disapproval
attaches. If I were to be the 'whole pile of shit' (or var. an elephant's,
rather than a rat's, ass, I might not be quite so soiled? Perhaps the
speaker is disappointed merely with the meager portion they've been served?

But I wonder, was there ever a 'real piece of work' to which the phrase
might have referred? Perhaps cleaning the dog kennel or something? Does it
attach to other meanings as well? I've a slight angst that perhaps it's
something burried in the closet of ruminations about my father's adroit
useages and that there's something rootish about the matter - in which case
I suppose this is a thread about gardening and not language.

The most clearly silent place in nature I have experienced is at the top
of one of the many cinder cones in the Craters of the Moon Nat'l Park in
central Idaho. These are essentially enormous cone-like formations of
volcanic rock ranging up to a few hundred feet high. Since the tourist
traffic is very minimal in this park, one can walk to the top of one of
these many cones and find a completely isolated spot looking out across a
wasteland of part lava bed, part brushland. No birds, etc, around. And
when there is no breeze where you are standing there is nothing hear.  But
at this point you begin to hear the sound of the blood pumping through
your ears, a sound that has always been there. This reminds me of the
music of the spheres, which was said to be so familiar to human ears that
it could no longer be perceived.  My thinking is that silence is best
considered as a threshhold one only approaches, for both external
(natural) and internal (bodily) reasons.

Here's how I understand it:

1. the overt sense is a term of admiration (not disparagement)

2.  something which is "a real piece of work" is, in non-ironical
useage, something which shows great beauty, workmanship, fascination,
is, in a word, remarkable in nature.

3.  As an *ironic* utterance, the sense of the term is, of course,
turned  somewhat on its head.  Thus, "You're a real piece of work"
may denote "you're a wonder! you're quite amazining!", but the ironic
subtext may be along the lines you suggest above.

4.  It seems possible that the expression"you're a piece of shit"
itself derived from the more genteel "you're a real piece of work"
(and not the other way around).

5.  I think part of the beauty & irony of "you're a real piece of
work" involves the notion that the mind of the person so addressed is
felt, by the person saying this utterance (in its original, somewhat
aristocratic context -- surely this is a 19th-century expression from
the upper classes?), -- the mind of the addressee is felt to be
something which, while defying logic or comprehension, is yet a
wonder in itself (poss. all the more so, for the fact of doing so).

6.  Of course, most charming & genteel expressions such as this can
be used in less sparkling manners & contexts, as seems to have been
the case w/ your experience of this locution.

No doubt, someone with access to DARE or some such resource work
detailing vernacular usage, could give a fuller (& more precise)
reading & background for the phrase.  The above is merely my own
overall sense of it (based on what I've heard), for what worth.

"A piece of work," in my experience, is always pejorative, except when the
person so described is seen as a marvel of unnecessary and exasperating
complexity, a rube goldberg contraption that evokes admiration that it can
function at all. OED Supplement supports this understanding, with examples
back to 1928. "Piece of shit" I think is probably unrelated. Then there's
also "piece of ass" or "tail" and "piece of the action," I think also
unrelated.
How about the verbs attached to various actions, to wit: to give (or not) a
shit or a fuck, to take a shit or a piss, or simply to go or to come, as
in: "Why are you fidgeting?" "I have to go. I always have to go after I
come."
A propos of this last, used to be (see Lindner, _The Fifty-Minute Hour_)
that those of the Freudian persuasion thought that a guy leaving the bed to
take a piss after getting a piece of ass, which his skirt might understand
as his not really giving a fuck, was really just a cover for a castration
fantasy--the guy was really checking to make sure that everything was still
there. There are, of course, easier and better physiological explanations.
Hard to believe that those psycho analysts were MD's. They must have been
real pieces of work.

re the silence thread, john tranter offhands:

"Dave, Kim ... how about some postings to the EPC list that have ...
that have no sender, no subject,and NO MESSAGE !!
Is this maybe too much silence to ask? It would be like Rimbaud in Harar
... nothing to say!"

reminding me to ask y'all if anyone has read or heard anything about
charles nicholl's /somebody else: arthur rimbaud in africa 1880-91/
(london: cape, 1997).

thanks,

sorry to report the death of elio schneeman (b.1961) on 8/17/97 of a drug
overdose. he was the son of george and katie schneeman and was a much loved
figure at the poetry project. His books were "In February, I think" (1978,
C Press) and the 91' volume "Along the Rails" from United Artist> His
funeral was held monday at St. Bridget's Church (the same as in the Frank
O' Hara and Bill Berkson collab -- "Hymns to St. Bridget's") w/ pall barers
including Greg masters, Mitch Highfill, and John Godfrey. Elio's work was
not known that much outside of the Project but is worth looking into. There
is a memorial reading being planned at Naropa in two weeks.

p.s.-- as elio would say: "No, I am not related to carolee schneeman". his
dad, however, is an artist whose work is familair to any reader of
berrigan, raworth. notley and other writers in poproject community as he

Language, Porosity, Quotation, Notes On


"Everyone makes jokes about macaroni, because it is a hole with some-
thing around it, or about canons. [sic] The fact that we laugh doesn't
change the situation, however; the fashioning of the signifier and the
introduction of a gap or a hole in the real is identical." (Lacan, VII)

"Lyotard comes close to what I have in mind when he says:

   The ambiguity of writing, object of reading and of sight, is
   present in the initial ambiguity of drawing. An open line, a
   line closed on itself. The letter is an unvarying closed line;
   the line is the open moment of the letter which perhaps closes
   again elsewhere, on the other side. Open the letter, you have
   the image, you have the emblem, the symbol and the letter.
                                (Lyotard, The Lyotard Reader, 48)

"Lyotard's beautiful evocation of the sinuous interweaving of the line
of writing and that of picturing points to a third term, to some con-
ception of the line before it has acquired the cohesion imparted to it
by either of its 'decisions.'" (Michael Carter, Putting a Face on
Things, Studies in Imaginary Materials)

Between macaroni and drawing, language noodles out, appearing in a dia-
lectic between the foreclosing of syntax and sememe, and the porosity of
the struggle towards coherence within any number of communicative chan-
nels, ranging from human speech to the reconstruction of true or false
memories in the brain.

If we look at a computer complete with operating system, we discover a
hierarchy of apparently relatively autonomous languages, beginning with
hardware, and working up to the user interface. These might include
machine language, assembly language, macroassembly languages, compiled
and interpreted languages, scripts, graphic interfaces, and so forth.

We can also consider these languages, top-down, as an extension of human
psychological operations and memory as well.

If we look closer, say, at Perl, we find that it can call up the Unix
shell and shell scripts, that it can call up programs in other lang-
uages, that it can interact in fact with assembly language, that it is
written in another language, and that it may itself be called up by
still another or the same language. We find it can interact with
scripts, programs, or processes, and each of these can call the other up
as well.

In fact, we can define a macro in Perl, a new function or verb, with any
of these languages, etc,, and we can define an object in Perl as well,
with any of them. In fact, one might note that there is above all a syn-
tactical plateau or intermeshing of plateaus that constitutes the posi-
tioning of Perl in relation to the machine, to the Internet, to the
user, and in general, to the porous world within which it is embedded.

We find then, that Perl is not so much at the top of a hierarchy, as it
is embedded in a holarchy, and while it, in a certain sense, might still
appear as an autonomous language, in another sense it is an accumulation
of interwoven well-defined processes that are coherent in relation to
each other and the outer world.

So that one might argue, taking these instantiations back into the
human, that while thought itself is in relation to human spoken
language, that is hardly the long or short of it; in fact, it is dif-
ficult to tell where semiosis begins and ends, and what constitutes a
well-defined verb or noun, in other words a framework. Further, while
difference may be said to be partly constitutive of a domain of sig-
nifiers, one might also argue that it is based on other processes within
the holarchy, and that the holarchy itself is porous in relation to the
real.

And I would argue in addition that there is a continuum (more properly,
perhaps, a stretch of rational fractions) from the real through lang-
uage, from the exhalations of speech through the mouth, and the recep-
tion of facial expressions through the eyes, from and to, in fact, num-
erous modalities - and in the midst of these, syntactical islands or
attractors which operate as-if the linguistic were capable of foreclos-
ure on what then appear to be various plateaus.

One might thing of the world as multiplexing, parallel/parallel proces-
sing, with formalization of the symbolic where necessary, for transmis-
sion, say, from one organism to another. This is not to argue, in addi-
tion in addition, for the computerization of the real, but rather for
the real itself as organism with continuously multiplying, coalescing,
and dissolving processes.

In this manner, the disjunction between thought and non-thought, and
both in conjunction and disjunction with language, become bridged, re-
routed into numerous processes, of which, say, human language and the
rationalizing/suturing discourse of psychoanalysis would be one among
many elements.

--

My own work exists as _debris-work,_ work of the debris, of these troub-
ling and interstitial areas. Thus, even within writing which must tend
towards a certain foreclosure, I present wryting, the fiction of writing
object and person within a text, object and person which leak into
uneasy dreams, fantasies, ghosts, peripheral shadows within the real
itself. Further, I present processes as writing, writing as processes; I
present foreclosure as broken, and a shattering of the vessels as fore-
closure.

--

Languagings extend into cultural sheaves, such as fashion, style, cul-
tural productions. Such sheaves are inherently irreducible; fashion, for
example, is dependent upon the armature of the body, but its specificity
is interwoven with the rest of culture, including issues of capital,
temperament, governance, and so forth. And all of these create an uneasy
fit with spoken language itself, with music, with organized/disorganized
sound of all sorts.

Further, fashion-as-language becomes as problematic as film language,
the languages of art, and so forth. A hat, for example, is simply a
thing that sits on the head (presumably remaining there through the
normal walking, etc. movement of the body). Beyond that, what signifies
and what doesn't is often difficult to discern. The _stream_ of style is
easier described, perhaps, as if there were a generalized semantics at
work. (See Carter, op. cit.) (Note that "what signifies here" is rele-
vant to the postulation of a basic lexeme; semantics, symbolization,
chaotic representational debris, etc., all play a role in constituting
what otherwise might be considered a "language." Instead, I postulate we
are dealing with linguistic part-objects, broken and severed codes,
micro-territories (three or one flowers on the hat; roses or tulips;
forward or backward, etc.). And this leads, as well, into the interplay
of semantics and syntax, even the interplay of what might be considered
a relevant series of signs.)

And further, still, ascii texts on the Internet employ what might be
considered a variety of extra-linguistic cues - on numerous chat lines,
ranging from Powwow to ytalk, it is possible to read the pace of the
other's typing, to the extent that one might speak/write of a written
_parole._ This embedding of language into the other's time reveals the
closeness, pressure, of the body against the keys, an intimacy which is
not as evident in the encapsulated messages sent out all at once, on
MOOs, talkers, IRC, and the like.

(For this reason, as I have pointed out elsewhere, ytalk becomes an in-
timate simulacrum of the body; the "breathing" of the texts between two
participants parallels that of lovers sharing a unified, if discordant,
space.)

Then there are, of course, emoticons, header information, lag, the tim-
ing of mail sent, and those porous extensions of the telephone, snail-
mail, video, etc. all of which serve literally to confuse the issue.
(Which is exactly the point here, that _language,_ _a language,_ is a
situated plateau in the midst of others, that there are always already
issues of governance and porosity from the start, that there is a tend-
ency towards foreclosure, that the porosity may or may not be formal-
ized (for example there are specific commands for shell access from a
Perl script) - that, in fact, one might consider a generalized process
of _worlding_ which includes all and none of these, what may or may not
be interpreted as an abstract process, message of the deepest import, or
signal through an autonomic nervous system, seemingly intent on keeping
the organism alive.)

Poetas,

Red Slider sent me this note --
<< david,
not sure about renga composition or my specific composition (I read,
but do not see the rules in operation - like a new football fan who
cannot quite understand why those fellows who do not have the ball are
beating the crap out of one another). If the contribution below
suitable i offer, if not - trash. thank you >>

& appended 2 lines.  I'm no renga-rabbi myself, but have an idea
it's customary to add one line per.  However, far be it from me to
nix as unkosh the 200% you append; too, perhaps my coupletization
was unduly normative couplet-wise-- also, sorry naving not included
some side-stream branchings (I think a couple from Maria D.) that
had branched off earlier than what's here -- pls. add, insert,
re-append, whatever! --

here's what I have in hopper to date, including Red's 2 --

I've been out of town, and *most* of you on the list will understand my
dismay at turning on the e-mail and out of 7 messages 3 were this renga
thread.  I thought it was agreed upon ages ago that so many listmembers
found these rengas problematic in terms of wasted bandwidth and a waste of
the 50-message limit that it was agreed that they would be taken
backchannel.

And I know some of the perpetrators of this thing were involved in the
original tedium.

I shall be sending this message widely over the next few days as I build my
new address book. Apologies for cross posting.

My email address at Compuserve should be considered dead. This is my new
one. I am still learning its oddnesses.

I am sorry for the change and the trouble it causes you, but I gave up on
the useless and cynical service that I received from Compuserve. This is
also likely to be cheaper.

Anything sent to Compuserve for me after 20th August 1997 is likely not to
have been received.

"Everyone makes jokes about macaroni, because it is a hole with some-

change the situation, however; the fashioning of the signifier and the
introduction of a gap or a hole in the real is identical." (Lacan, VII)


Boy, does this ever make me feel like I'm outside the loop! I don't think I
know anybody who makes jokes about macaroni, not even in France. Maybe I
don't hang out with the right psychoanalysts.

Note, however, that Monsieur Lacan has to explain what's funny about
macaroni, but not what's funny about cannon. Perhaps in his world a cigar
is a cigar but it's never just a cigar.

For those interested in building alliances between labor and the academy:


From:     Dan Clawson (clawson@sadri.umass.edu)
To:       anyone interested in labor
Re:       signing a statement, joining a group


     The revival of the American labor movement, and its openness to a
variety of initiatives that would have been inconceivable a few years ago,
is the most promising political initiative of recent years.  A new group
is forming to build links between academics and the labor movement.  John
Sweeney, Linda Chavez Thompson, and the New Voice leadership have
explicitly encouraged this development.  They hope that we can work to
alter the debates taking place in public policy and on the cultural front,
in our teaching and in every public forum, just as they are working to
change realities in trade unions.  Together we can be part of a broader
labor movement that includes both these areas and much more.

     I realize it is ludicrously short notice, but an ad and press
conference are planned announcing the formation of this group.  In order
to get your name on the ad, you need to send your name and affiliation to

tnr1@columbia.edu  (that's a #1, not a letter L)

by Tuesday August 26.  If you don't make that date, you can still join the
group; see the address in the enclosed memo.

     If you'd prefer, you could send your name and affiliation to me, Dan
Clawson, (clawson@sadri.umass.edu) and I will pass it on.

     Together we can build a movement for social change.  You can begin by
passing this message on to everyone you can think of who would want to
sign.

Dan Clawson


Labor Day, 1997

For two decades, Labor Day has been an occasion for eulogies and epitaphs,
as the labor movement suffered deindustrialization, downsizing and defeat.
But Labor Day 1997 arrives with a new militance and a new hope. The
victory of the Teamsters in the two-week UPS strike -- the largest strike
in a generation -- was a victory for all working people, whose incomes and
livelihoods have stagnated for nearly a quarter of a century. The UPS
strike was also a turning point for the labor movement, and could
determine its strength and direction for years to come.

Though the right to organize has eroded in a world of contingent work --
part-time, temporary, outsourced, and subcontracted -- organizing
campaigns across the continent are now rebuilding the labor movement in
old and new workplaces: from Borders bookstores to Las Vegas casinos, from
the strawberry fields of Watsonville to the classrooms of Berkeley and
Yale, from Federal Express to Nike sweatshops.

We take this moment of struggle to announce the formation of a new
independent, national organization: "Scholars, Artists, and Writers for
Social Justice." In the academy and publishing, in the arts, sciences and
entertainment, we also experience the growth of low-wage, part-time
employment which erodes our craft and creativity. We call upon our
colleagues and friends this Labor Day to declare their solidarity with the
organizing drives of the new labor movement. The time is ripe to restore
the mutually empowering relationship that once gave hope and dynamism to
the labor movement and its allies in the academic and cultural
communities.

We envision a movement that can reshape the nation's political culture by
combating inequality and powerlessness, and by fostering the growth of a
vibrant, militant, multicultural working-class movement. In an era
when elite opinion makes a fetish of the free market, unions -- with a
commitment to solidarity, equality, and collective struggle -- remain
fundamental institutions of a democratic society. Our confidence in
launching SAWSJ comes from the success of the "labor teach-in" movement,
inaugurated last fall when more than 2,000 people affirmed a new alliance
of labor and academe at Columbia University. In more than a score of other
teach-ins from coast to coast, students, teachers, writers, artists, and
unionists met, talked, learned, and argued in an atmosphere of hope and
solidarity. SAWSJ hopes to fulfill the promise of those teach-ins.

Tom: I've just finished the book. It's very good -- Nicholl is extremely
knowledgable on Rimbaud, is a good writer, and has tramped all over
Africa looking for the Ghost of Arthur.

It's a wretched story, of course. There's Arthur, tramping about,
working himself to the bone, scraping and saving, getting ill and
recovering, cursing the natives and the other traders, feverishly making
plans for the future, and all the time we know it's all for nothing --
we can see the cancer coming like a dust-storm on the horizon.
Heartbreaking.
But a very good book.

john t., thanks for the good word on nicholl's rimbaud book. certainly a
sad story -- after all those years of wheelin and dealin he died with what
the equivalent of a couple hundred bucks in his pocket.  yet the disdain
is quite captivating, effectively, all writing is pigshit, a good 40-50
yrs before artaud, let les jeunes poetes maudites discover anew the
writings of the "recently deceased" rimbaud, and me not even dead yet,
merdre!, all i wanna do is be a gunrunner...

what is little known about rimbaud is that he visited australia with his
young bride, directly from ethiopia by packet steamer. The Rimbauds were
fairly flush at the time, and stayed in what was, for that era in Oz, a
luxury hotel. On their first day, they hired a coach & four to go
drive-about. Unfortunately, one of the first things they saw in the outback
was a man having intercourse with a kangaroo. Rimbaud attempted to distract
his wife from the sordid spectacle by pointing in the opposite direction
and crying, "Look at that, my precious!" They both looked, only to see
another man with another kangaroo. Disgusted, Rimbaud ordered the driver to
head back to the hotel. There, to top the unhappy morning off, they found a
man with a wooden leg masturbating on the hotel steps. Outraged, and with
his notorious temper fully aroused, Rimbaud demanded to see the manager. "I
have come a long way at considerable expense to stay in your hotel, and
what do I and my poor wife find? Two men having intercourse with two
seperate kangaroos, and a man with a wooden leg masturbating on the very
steps of this hotel?!"

The manager's reply has been recorded: "But Monsieur Rimbaud, you dont
expect a man with a wooden leg to catch his own kangaroo?"

The Rimbauds wanted to quit the establishment immediately, but there was
nowhere else to go. They were stuck. Rimbaud had put the manager of the
hotel in a foul mood, and that evening, he ordered all the chess players
who frequented his lounge, to pack up their boards and leave. This they
did, grudgingly, but one Among them remonstrated withg the manager,
demanding to know his reason for such rudeness. This reply, too, has been
recorded: "I cant stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer."

For these and other anecdotes of Rimbaud in Oz I found the text under
discussion well worth borrowing from my college library.  David

Since I accidentally blurted it out to the whole list, and later got
several backchannel replies expressing interest, I'm reposting the URL of
the embryonic version of my second chapbook, which is forthcoming from
Pecan Grove Press, a small and underacknowledged press in Texas which
devotes itself exclusively--I think--to poetry of various different
stripes. The prepublication version of the text is at:

Subject:      Problem in silence

I've a problem in silence representation. In a dramatic narrative, meant to
be read aloud (perhaps for radio performance as well), I've need for a gap
both thematically and visually to separate the scene of Coleridge's 'rotten
sea' from a new vista of turbulence at the "dragon's edge."

Presently I'm using an ellipsis not entirely to my satisfication.
The fragment I'm working with (backed-up enough to display the
discontinuity is:

The silence in her hold as thick as blood, her only cargo grim
remembrance of the day the brood of flags hung still, breathless
as she pulled against a shudderless heave of rotten death
across watery waste, sighted once before by he who murdered
the albatross. Lost! Lost! as we carry out the heart's knell
hand over hand, each breath a bolide in a birdless sky, and wait...
till the bell-pull sounds on an empty deck and the bitter end slacks
against the kedge, as darkness falls and the gale winds rise
and the great seas shudder at the dragon's edge.

(an in-progress and imperfect version of the entire work can be seen at
http://sacramento-news.com/poets/redpoem.htm)

The problems are:

the break is between a scene, itself typed in silence (the becalmed sea),
and the resumption of contrasting material; and, also serves as a
performance instruction for an indefinite pause by the reader.

The work is antiqued (broken iambic, rhyme - at times dense, 17th c.
nautical terms, etc.), with some deliberate 'moderns' (the ship has
engines/iron-plate, the reader is directly engaged at points, etc.). But
the silence representations I've encountered (say in the (     ) thread)
seem to stark  for the piece, too swedish-modern.  Appreciate any ideas.

it also turns up in Harryette Mullen's /Muse & Drudge/, as part of the
phrase "hincty-jinkty."  No idea what THAT means.  Mullen, in BOO is it,
mentions Clarence Major's dictionary of African American slang, From Juba to
Jive, as key source for her.  Don't recall offhand the hincty-jinkty page #.

Dear Bill, and anyone else interested:

In my 1984 edition of The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book, Bernadette Mayer's

Here's my suggestion. If you are performing this on a stage, wait four or
five beats after the word, "wait," and then have an on-stage bell begin
ringing, activated by somebody offstage. The audience would see the bell
moving and hear the sounds, but see nobody doing the actual ringing. Now,
I know this isn't silence if by that we mean the lack of sound. But, I
think the tolling of a bell, especially if it seems to be ringing of its
own accord, will create the feeling of emptiness that the lines speak of.

If you are doing this as a radio performance, I'd still suggest the bell
perhaps with fade-ins and -outs. Of course, there's no way that I can
think of to show the bell ringing by itself on the radio.

In both cases, you might also want to experiment with the length of the
ringing, its volume, whether you read the next line over the ringing or
wait a few more beats after the ringing. You might even want to experiment
with how far you can push the audience with the ringing -- monotony being
a type of silence.

for what it's worth,
Steven

Hi Lisa--

Did you get Lorenzo's number?  I'll ask Max Regan tomorrow.

I put out the word for readers and four people are interested in April.
So then I got this idea about a festival.

Something like "Against the World as We Know It Festival: Poetry and
Politics for the Next Millenium."  And work with local poets and
political groups to house visiting poets and organizers and have a
bandshell and a band and a picnic and you know, I think it could be a
lot of fun.

Would that interest you?

yours,

Rachel

The definition's right but it's also worth noting that hincty is a sort of
hald-anagram of "head nigger in charge."  -Mike.

Moreover, the renga didn't seem to be about Nancarrow,
four:four is the dullest time signature, for:for is
for oneself, is this a way to honour the dead, would
a renga have sprung up for Burroughs' death so
equivalently not about Burroughs?

Those of you who weren't sure what kind of divisions there are in the
poetry world when the question of an avant-garde came up recently may find
the following interesting.
I just spoke with the editorial office at _Booklist_, the journal of the
American Library Association. I had submitted Rochelle Owens' _New and
Selected Poems_ to them for review. As the excellent review in Publishers'
Weekly had just come out I was curious as to whether _Booklist_ intended to
review it. Like it or not, a good review in _Booklist_ is worth 200-300
sales to libraries. I was informed that their poetry editor had rejected it
because, in the words of an internal memo, it "represents the kind of
poetry that convinces people that poetry is too difficult to read." I think
I offended the guy on the other end of the line when I volunteered that
they should maybe find a less naive poetry editor.
The book came to them with extensive praise from, among others, Karl Young,
Marjorie Perloff and Jerry Rothenberg, but that didn't get it past the
gate-keeper.

Uh oh. Looks like it's time to send in the sapper squad. I propose that this
elite unit be comprised of David Bromige (who will baffle editors with
"cabbages and rhinoceroses"), Tom Mandel (who will lay down the Law) and
Rachel Loden (who will overcome with great gentleness and failing that, slap
recalcitrant gatekeepers silly). Hovering in the background will be the
Spirit of Allen Ginsberg on harmonium, chanting "Woe to Bablyon, woe!" and
radiating angelic poetry vibes of irresistible potency.

Thanks to everybody who backchannelled with the lowdown on devolution.
Apparently, Brian Eno never received a cent from his work on Q: Are We Not
Men?, and both Sri Lanka and Scotland have serious devolution efforts in
the works.

You folks are dicty, not hincty,

I'll try to scrounge up my Mullen file folder, but I'm not really sure where

originally brought to my attention.  One is the BOO interview; then there's,
I think, a short essay by her in POETIC BRIEFS.

BOO is a newsprint publication that comes out of Vancouver, something like
quarterly, which ran an interview with Mullen about a year ago.

I don't have the address at hand, but one or another of the principals may
be on the list, still, or some other Vancouverite might have contact info.

(That's Vancouver BC, by the way, about 150 miles north of here, NOT
Vancouver WA, about 150 miles south of here.)

&, after a few days traveling in the opposite direction as Dodie, I can
only say ditto in re: the burgeoning renga.  While I have read some
finished rengas in print & online form the earlier group that were of
interest, being a captive reader of these works in process is not a
beautiful thing.  (For those who care to check into the old renga scare I
think it was two years ago, summer of 1995.)

A quick note of warning to my fellow email users. Should you consider using
compuserve, learn from my situation. Three days after I cancelled my
account with them and asked them to justify recent charges, they put in a
debit to my credit card company for ANOTHER month. Now I have to jump
through hoops if I want to get my money back.

Thanks to Tenney, Herb, Red Slider, David Brominge, and Thomas Bell for the
Mullen information.  I've e-mailed Deanna Ferguson about the interview in
BOO and will report back when I hear.  Meanwhile, does anyone know the
citation for the Poetic Briefs essay Tenney mentions?

I like Thomas Bell's idea of seeing whether some of Mullen's harder-to-find
pieces could be posted on the EPC hotlist.  Is there anything a person
could do to help make that happen?

Does anybody have an opinion about Yusef Komunyakaa and Sascha
Feinstein's "Jazz Poetry Anthology" and "Second Set: Jazz Poetry
Anthology Volume Two" -- I just heard about them from Amazon.com, but
since their goal is to sell you the book, their glowing review isn't
necessarily to be trusted.  Do Komunyakaa and Feinstein cover all the
bases?  Do they include discussions of Jazz poetics?  Is the book filled
with bland beat hymns of praise for great players?  Do tell...

I'm more taken with the range of work in Moment's Notice edited by Art
Lange & Nathaniel Mackey.

I've only looked at the Komunyakaa & Feinstein collections in bookstores,
so I don't know them as well, but that also means that looking them over in
bookstores didn't seduce me into buying the books.

Moment's Notice offers a wider range of styles (including both poetry &
prose), whereas the other collections seem (in my memory, at least) to be
more or less limited to Beatnik stylings & personal experience poems.

I'd also recommend looking at Aldon Nielsen's book Black Chant for the last
couple of chapters on jazz & poetry.  Besides covering the jazz/poetry
dynamic/aesthetic pretty well, this book also has a good bibliography &
discography of work relevant to the subject.

Hope this helps,

Herb

I've used the Jazz Poetry Anthology in a lyric poetry class I taught here
at the University of Iowa.  I think that both the first volume and the
second set are o.k. . . . A little too traditional for my tastes.  It
containts too much poetry about jazz and jazz artists and too little that
actually utilizes a jazz poetic.

If I had it to do over again I would use the Mackey anthology that is
published by Gray Wolf Press (the name of which escapes me).  From what
I've seen of that, it seems to be much more about formal innovation than
the Feinstein & Komunyakaa text.

Well, as Ronnie said, there you go again.  How is it I always seem to
get cast as something between the hostess of Romper Room and Nurse
"those who are late do not get fruit cup" Diesel?  I've spent the
summer, Patrick, working on needlepoint samplers of Amy Lowell and
rereading _Satyagraha in South Africa_ and _Letter from Birmingham
Jail_, so I've sworn off violence except in really hopeless cases, such
as Radovan Karadzic, or maybe certain backwoods relations of George
Bowering.

=09=09=09=09Above the world-weary horizons

=09=09=09=09New obstacles for exchange arise

=09=09=09=09Or unfold, O ye postmasters!



1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently about 500 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list

should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea=20
is

to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and

also to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible. =20


Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for
further

information. Joel Kuszai is list manager.  For subscription information
contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.=20



____________________________________________________________________


2. Subscriptions


The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or

unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject

line, to:


listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.


*

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system

administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages=20
to

Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your
Poetics

mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new

address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora

(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the
Tools

menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you=20
can

substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.


The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If
your

system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may

get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to
us.

If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase
from

your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription
is

part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider

obtaining a commercial account.


____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot always decode attached or specially formatted
files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.=20


____________________________________________________________________


4. Digest Option


The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to

your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message

each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that

day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no
subject

line) to

                                listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu


set poetics digest


NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply

to this message!!


You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:


set poetics mail

____________________________________________________________________


5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail


Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be
away

for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you
may

lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can
temporarily

turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to "listserv."



set poetics nomail


& turn it on again with: set poetics mail


When you return you can check or download missed postings from the
Poetics

archive. (See 8 below.)


____________________________________________________________________


6. Who's Subscribed


To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the
e-mail message

blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:


  review poetics


You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail)=20
a

rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics

subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.


 or try:


 review POETICS by name

 review POETICS by country


which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country (since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)


*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.*

____________________________________________________________________


7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?


our URL is


http://writing.upenn.edu/epc


The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to

serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity
in

formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The
Center

provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the
new

poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the
POETICS

List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct

connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also
provides information about contemporary print little magazines and SMALL
PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive
collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as

well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.


The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

____________________________________________________________________


8. Poetics Archives via EPC


Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the

links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and

year or search them for specific information. Your interface will

allow you to print or download any of these files.


Or set your browser to go directly to:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive


____________________________________________________________________


9. Publishers & Editors Read This!


PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is
open and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed
publications

as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send
a

list of your press/publications to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the
words EPC Press Listing in the subject line. You may also send materials
on disk. (Write file name, word processing program, and Mac or PC on
disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above to obtain a mailing
address to which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If yourword processor ill
save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly desirable


Send us extended information on new publications (including any back
cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists
(including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to
include full information for ordering--including prices and addresses and
phone numbers both of the press and any distributors.


Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new=20
publications

directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check
the

        The road which leads me to you is safe even when it runs into oceans.

                Edmond Jabes, The Book of Questions



felt like Fellini.
Young voices write video screen,
not too old, held upstairs
spinning drums, washed by
harem, pure wife.

that word of mine
propriety making this video
when in a second it is me writing
it spoken, responsibility
a point later edited out

so where does the writing
begin which is a way of
writing out shame.  She says
I am the screen well
that's true, admission
says you need us

I suppose it's a matter
of timing opening dam
bedrock to sky that total
responsibility in the midst
of technology's blind spot

so that returning to love
and an arbitrary division of
paragraphs yet when her face
shimmered it was all to a
certain extent lost
structure confluence

John,

My understanding is that the Ear series finally came to a close last spring
with a reading by Steve Benson and Leslie Scalapino. There's a new series
somewhere that is supposed to be the continuation, but either they haven't
gotten started yet or else have not continued with the same mailing list.
Can somebody please fill us Philadelphia-region folks in!

I'm going to violate my rule against posting to the list twice in one day to
call attention to the following website:

http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/BOOKS/t000074985.html

There you will find John Ashbery writing to the LA Times about Alexander
Theroux's review of his first five books and Theroux's response. The gist
being that Ashbery is said to be a fine writer when he doesn't behave like a
relative of Stein, Olson (whose name is spelled Olsen by both, or perhaps by
the LA Times' editor), Pound, even Berryman.

Theroux, if you've had the fortune to miss the work, is a classic example of
an academic novelist (Princeton at the moment, I think) who strikes the
tough guy pose in his prose (he's an amateur at this compared with Leonard
Michaels), which aspires to some sort of made for TV aesthetics.

Dean --

quite well done -- the serene pacing, text-roll & image-fades --
seems to fulfill (to a degree, or at least in a certain manner) what
I've often felt to be interesting possibilities for the medium, but
which I've rarely seen explored with much sense of adequacy.

A good example -- an interesting instance -- of what can be done.
Reminds me somewhat of my sensation on seeing work of some
more-"serious" video artists (e.g., Irit Batsry in NYC), who're
interested in really working with the medium's own potential . . .

Yes, the upper imagery didn't appear on my browser (Netscape 2 level)
till the poem-text had run thru its cycle onece -- then one properly
had the full effect.  Other viewers might bear this in mind.  The
pacing was not (quite) as slow as Butoh -- was (I'd say) pretty well
set; too fast would have been (pardoning the tautology) too fast;
whereas much slower might've bordered on excruciating . . . .

all this is not commenting on "content" issues, but rather, on the
techno-achievement (& hat-tipping toward the so-to-say
more-than-nascent poetics thereof . . .  )

thanks,
d.i.

I'd say "ditto" in response to Herb's e-mail.  The Mackey co-edited
volume has more range to it.  I'd especially second Herb's
enthusiastic recommendation of Aldon Nielsen's _Black Chant_--a truly
great resource, and an enjoyable read.  The current issue of _River
City_ magazine has a couple of short essays on jazz & poetry: one by
me (on early Creeley, and current Mackey), and one by Aldon.

I'm sure NYC-ers have more details, but here on the west coast the word is
that the Ear Inn series is now at the Hear Cafe.  A rather strange

Thanks for that heads up, Ron - boy oh boy is Theroux all wet! The job he
does on Little JA makes Sven Birkerts look like a perfect gentleman (and I
imagine he is since I can't imagine him ever stooping so low...).

So, late in 1997, people are still getting riled over their inability to
locate "truth" in poems.  Gosh. Theroux is Allen Tate redux, preaching the
mealy-mouthed humanist gospel of clarity, as if a poem were merely a
transparent envelope and the poet a courier for some literary FedEx.

As a friend of mine from Texas is fond of saying: That tightens my jaw.
 This points up my recent experience on the second day of my Critical
Analysis of Poetry class: we were reading Sandburg's homiletic "Grass." On
the page before, though, was a wee excerpt from Stein's "Stanza" -- such
wonderful, playful, bracing stuff -- and thanks to the attitude of hostility
and fear fostered by people like Theroux, how will students ever be
introduced to it?  As Victor McLaglen opines in Ford's "Fort Apache" -
"we've got a job of work ahead of us and no mistake..."

Last I checked, Mullen's essay had not yet appeared in print -- but I've

Subject:      'pataphysics & Opal Louis Nations
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A contemporary norte americano working the 'pataphysical vein who is too
little known & read, Opal louis Nations, may be introduced here w/o my
dipping too far into irrelevance, I trust. Author of a number of books
published between 1970-1990(?), but for some years now on sabbatical from
writing while he works in the studio reviving old gospel, doo-wop, & r n b
acetates for the CD industry, Nations (aptly named [and by himself]) : born
& raised in Britain, national of Canada, immigrant long since to the USA)
is probably best encountered via _A Browsers Guide to Opal L. Nations_, put
out by the now-defunct Coach House Press in Toronto but still likely
available at the right library or 2nd hand bookshop. I know that when  I
read from this to a KSW group last year in Vancouver, they were astonished
that a writer of such intensity concerning things absurd shared passports
with them, and wanted to hear more of him. With his wife Ellie Humm
(originally from Norway), Opal edited the magazine _Strange Faeces_
throughout the 70s.

Extra-literary talents possessed by this one-off figurante include a
6-octave range with perfect pitch (he has sung with a number of groups,
beginning with the Frays in London in the 60s--Decca recording artists),
and a gift for drawing, whether straight-ahead represntation, or the
cartoons more in keeping with his writing interests.

Early an associate of Allen Fisher (collecting early doo-wop, not poetry,
initially drew them together), and during his Canadian spell, Steve
McCaffery, I believe Nations' lukewarm interest in French theory of the
recent past accounts for the drop off in attention to his work, and, on his
part, in furthering his writing. And too, he is a "loner" poet in a time of
assiduous networking.

David, thanks for that lovely & accurate take on Opal -- whose work has
much delighted me over the years & is indeed very much & unjustly
neglected in the cyber-90s -- & whose generosity as publisher in the
England of the seventies was proverbial -- when I started SIXPACK it was
he who showed up on my doorstep & offered his equipment for use -- &
then published my own first book.  -- doo-wop de doo, Pierre

I've just read the exchange between Ashbery and Theroux in the LA Times
that Ron tipped us off to (you can get Ashbery's reply to the review and
Theroux's reply to Ashbery free at the LATimes website, but the original
review (Aug. 3) appears to be pay-per-view). Theroux, who gets last word
(the home team always does) to clinch his argument that the great moderns
and their supporters are often in a conspiracy to perpetrate fraud by being
less than plain-spoken and linear, quotes some lovely paratactic lines of
Ashbery's as proof that Ashbery is not entitled to ask anyone for clarity
of argument, his crimes against such being so flagrant. He also discounts
Stein because she flunked her lit courses. It never occurs to Theroux that
he simply may not know how to read the writers he criticizes.
In light of the above, I thought that the backchannel thread between me and
Charles Alexander might be useful. He is responding to the poetics list
posting that I reproduce below. (Charles agreed to our outing).

Those of you who weren't sure what kind of divisions there are in the
poetry world when the question of an avant-garde came up recently may find
the following interesting.
I just spoke with the editorial office at _Booklist_, the journal of the
American Library Association. I had submitted Rochelle Owens' _New and
Selected Poems_ to them for review. As the excellent review in Publishers'
Weekly had just come out I was curious as to whether _Booklist_ intended to
review it. Like it or not, a good review in _Booklist_ is worth 200-300
sales to libraries. I was informed that their poetry editor had rejected it
because, in the words of an internal memo, it "represents the kind of
poetry that convinces people that poetry is too difficult to read." I think
I offended the guy on the other end of the line when I volunteered that
they should maybe find a less naive poetry editor.
The book came to them with extensive praise from, among others, Karl Young,
Marjorie Perloff and Jerry Rothenberg, but that didn't get it past the
gate-keeper.

                                                Mark


Mark, you devil.

You know perfectly well that these three names wouldn't get anything past,
or even TO, those particular gate-keepers. My guess is that those
gate-keepers might not have ever heard these three names.

I mean, there are borders, and then there are glaciers.

                                                Charles


Of course you're right, and that's the point. We can argue about what's
meant by avant garde, but I know damned well that the two conservative
books that I've published, Mervyn Taylor's and Susie Mee's, both of which I
think are marvelous books, got reviewed in Library Journal, Publisher's'
Weekly and Booklist, until Rochelle's none of the others have been reviewed
in even one of the three, and the review of Rochelle's begins "Owens is yet
another talented poet who has not received her due because her poems are
neither easy nor easily classifiable." It happens that I don't think that
any of the books I've published are difficult (few books of poems are--they
usually yield pretty easily to being read aloud), but most are non-linear,
which is what I think these cats mean by difficult. The linear is where the
line is drawn, and that applies to ways of experiencing a lot more than
just poems, heaven help us in this poor benighted land.

                                                        Mark



I'm not so certain about this, Mark, and perhaps I am more cynical than you
are. I think, for example, that a number of poets in those 'conservative'
circles (terminology, we know, is quite loaded with pitfalls here) are
beginning to give Robert Duncan a consenting nod -- even, if they are
feminist, Gertrude Stein -- and not necessarily reading these two narrowly.
For living writers it's a different story, but is the line really about
linearity. I fear it's more of a social question than that. Where did who
go to school, who do they know, who reads and cares about their work, etc.?
What you suggest is that people actually try to read our 'difficult' books
and are somewhat troubled by the nonlinear nature. What I wonder is if it,
usually, even gets to the point of a reading, if a writer doesn't have a
particular pedigree. That is the point where John Ashbery having gone to
Harvard gets him in a few doors that Tom Mandel or Ron Silliman or Mary
Margaret Sloan is not going to enter. Michael Palmer gets in some of those
doors, too. And I don't say that to fault Ashbery or Palmer in the least.

If these were truly aesthetic questions, I would like it very much. But I
fear that something else gets in the way before aesthetics or poetics even
gets a chance. Something which is part social, part political, part MFA or
school-related, part ugly, largely but not entirely unrecognized by those
who would bar the gates.

I hope John Ashbery will respond to Alexander Theroux's question about the
number of commas in Ashbery's _Tennis Court Oath_ poem, "Idaho." H may see
no need to do so, but it does seem like a matter worth addressing,
_proportion_, especially in this context. Who among us would maintain that
Ashbery never published a less-than-perfect poem? So the hell what?
Unlike Wordsworth, Ashbery seems to have persevered long enough to write
_very well_ again.

That the LA Times wants web readers to pay for articles is fine, their
business, but that the amount they want to charge is greater than $0.01 is
discouraging. Microdollars! are what I have for Theroux's prose (and
sorry, Dalkey, zip for the poems). Ad hominem on him aside, has anybody
read the original review? Is Ashbery's account of Theroux's antagonism to
modern(post)ism supportable?

What does an arbitrary number of commas threaten? (What are the um
gender/camp/literary historical deals in "Idaho" that Theroux's
dropkicking? Do they matter? Is it a strictly formal poem that offends
Theroux on a strictly formal level? Would two commas have been
sufficient? What about Ron Loewinsohn's poem about the swimmers with the
row of semicolons -- is or is not that more meaningful? more beautiful?)

Are we really just a bunch of post-Berlinwall communards? Brave benighted
souls? Ecch. How long will poets continue to be held to insane standards?

Yours in the question yams,
Jordan

PS Is this the first mention of Olsen (sic) outside of poetry land in
years, or is it my image nation?

And when will someone do for the line from Ashbery to Padgett what has
been done so successfully for the line from Olson to Howe?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

          On the day I post a thumbnail sketch of Opal Nations, a happy
shock to see (for 1st time since i signed on the List) the name of Ron
Loewinsohn, a writer probably better-known (Allen anthology) than Opal, but
one also who was read by a number of my associates in the 70's & who then
stopped writing (or publishing, in any case) poetry. He has scholarly
articles on W.C.W. & perhaps others, and two novels published, one of
which, _Magnetic Fields_, won a worthwhile prize, but I havent seen his
poetry for a long time. _Watermelons_ was published in the late 50s (Ron
then being in his very early 20s), with praise front & back from WCW &
Allen Ginsberg. A number of books followed, with perhaps the most notable
being _Against the Silences to Come_ , whose title poem is built up of some
exquisite "chording" that links the daily paper with history of the poem as
feeling-object. Again, a poet to recommend, one who may not be known to the
generation now in their 20s and 30s.

Despite the slightly obit tone of my postings today, these poets are both
very much alive, Nations when not in the recording studio can be found at
...help, the name of that record store in Albany? El Cerrito? ...and
Loewinsohn, teaching at UC Bkly. Give em a read.  David


footnote to Opal Nations as multi-talented person : for many years, he was
a highly popular DJ on KPFA (pbs) Bkly, until "let go" by dubious
management decision. He has taken his show (originally "Doo-Wop Delights")
to a pbs station in Santa Cruz, but just once or twice monthly.

The crucial essay is Nichol's "The "Pata of Letter Feet, or, The English
Written Character as a Medium for Poetry." i think this also one of the
few _critical_ pieces bp wrote on the topic, i mean he was a performer,
and didn't always stop performing to rationalize over the performance.
i cld be wrong. But this essay is such a _pause_. Of course there is also
the collected symposium papers of the conf. held in Toronto (i forget the
date). But again i think his essay there is more a performance of
"pataphysics than critical account. Nichol's essay has fascinated since
forever. It's such an important text. he wrote it coz Prof. Hugh LeRoy
in the Fine Arts Dept. at York University asked him to, to come in and
talk abt art & poetry to the graduate students there. That was in 1985 or
86. i've seen the manuscript version of this text and it's interesting how
he ponders & revises certain words, certain phrases. The essay is so
simple. But not too simple. As you can tell, i love that essay and cld
talk abt it forever. But i'm saving my best stuff for my dissertation. We
owe Prof. LeRoy much thanx.

Greetings all,

Those interested in what might be called an "applied 'pataphysics" will
want to take a look at the recent "Open Letter" (Ninth Series, Number 7,
Winter 1997), edited by Christian Bok (whose dissertation is actually on
'Pataphysics) and Darren Wershler-Henry (whose dissertation is a
long-overdue study of the typewriter and literature), two York students
whose combination of brilliance and irreverence probably hasn't been seen
in a university since the Moscow Linguistic Circle formed in the mid
'teens.  Of special note in the issue: Steve McCaffery's "Zarathrustran
'Pataphysics," which takes Christopher Dewdney's "Fractal Diffusion" an
order of magnitude further.

Highest recommendation as well to their recent books of poetry, Bok's
"Crystalography" (Coach House Press, 1994) and Wershler-Henry's
"NICHOLODEON: a book of lowerglyphs" (Coach House Printing, 1997).

happy reading,
--Craig Dworkin

I just received a request for a review copy of Rochelle Owens' book from
"S.V. Caldwell, Ph.D., Editor" of the Sandia Review of Books in
Albuquerque. Regular letterhead, no phone number. The mag isn't listed in
CLMP or Dustbooks, and I suspect that it's a phoney. This happened to me
once before, with another outfit that turned out to be a scam to build a
personal library for free. Has anybody out there heard of Sandia or its editor?

Poetas,

according to today's NY Times (see appended excerpt), the good (&
needfully clandestine) writer Salman Rushdie has wed an American poet
by name Elizabeth.  Many happy returns.

The article refers to a new prose-fiction anthology, published in the
U.S. as *Mirrorwork:  50 Years of Indian Writing (1947-1997)*,
edited by Salman Rushdie and Elizabeth West (Henry Holt & Co.)

(seems, the implication is "West" would be a pseudonym)

          Salman Rushdie, Still Hiding, Is Married in Secret

          By JANE H. LII

          Salman Rushdie, the author of "The Satanic Verses," who has
          lived in hiding for nearly a decade as the object of an open-ended
          Islamic death sentence, was married in secret on Thursday in
          the Hamptons on Long Island.

          The details of the wedding were not given, but Andrew Wylie,
          Rushdie's agent, said Saturday: "Elizabeth and Salman
          Rushdie are happy to confirm that they were married on
          Thursday, Aug. 28, in a small ceremony."

          Newspaper reporters in London, speaking on the condition of
          anonymity, said the new Mrs. Rushdie, whose maiden name is
          being withheld to protect her safety, is a poet who had
          collaborated with Rushdie on an anthology of modern Indian
          writing. The Daily Mail, a newspaper published in London,
          reported that the couple had had a child last month. . . .

btw, talkin' of celebrity & anonymity, here's my contribution anent
the late Princess of Wales -- responsive to remarks from one writer
(here rendered anon.) not from this list . . .; a "boomerang poem"
(as I call 'em).

  poise / pause / paz    (for Diana)

  that the known might desire anonymity
  (the anonymous still coveting renown)
  that the famous should pine for obscurity?
  when celebs are the talk-of-the-town
  (ever bearing the weight of that crown)
  might one just assume fathom the surety
  of less-glamorous chances to frown? . . .
  how the known may renew anonymity

d.i.

Mark, Sandia Review of Books does sound familiar. It is more like a
local book review newspaper, I believe, than any kind of "little
magazine," so I'm not surprised if it doesn't show up in Dust Books
or CLMP. Someone in Albuquerque on this list probably knows, if there
is someone in Albuquerque on this list. If not, you might find your
way, perhaps through the web, to an Albuquerque phone book or
business directory -- or you might try to find and call a bookstore
in Albuquerque.

i know Karl Young only recently put a series of bp's _Translating
Translating Apollinaire_ pomes on his Grist archive. i think poetics may
even be linked to it. if not _wr-eye-tings_ is. i can't remember the
address for the archive off hand. Grist may be the place to start, tho.

Karl Young's  Light & Dust web site was mentioned as having bp
Nichol's work, relating to the pataphysics thread, but someone (was
it you, Carl) didn't have the URL at hand.

The URL of the Light & Dust's contents page is
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm

Works by Nichol there are Translating Translating Apollinaire, at
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/bpnichol/lnichol1.htm


and works from Sharp Facts (variations on Translating Translating
Apollinaire 26), at
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/bpnichol/bpsh.htm

But also look around at other works there. To me, it's one of the
very best poetry sites on the web.
