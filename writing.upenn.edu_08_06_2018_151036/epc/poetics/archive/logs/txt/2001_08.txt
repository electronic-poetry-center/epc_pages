Bob Grumman kindly reminded me about another contribution to punctuation poetry, a poem called "The Party" by Canadian poet George Swede. Here is an excerpt from Bob's essay ("Notes on the Taxonomy of Visual Poetry and Related Species of Art" for *Eye-Rhymes*, University of Alberta, June 1997) , discussing that work:

"What about George Swede's "The Party" . . . ?  Swede's work has no verbal elements--or does it?  Should ampersands, dollar signs, questions marks, and various kinds of other typographical symbols count as verbal?  It's a hazy taxonomical area . . .  I would call "The Party" a visual poem because I consider the ampersand a word; it is merely a different spelling of "and."  If not for the ampersand, though (and the equally verbal plus and minus signs), I would lean toward calling the work a textual illumage--i.e., a work of visual art, that is, which is composed of typographical elements but is not a poem because of its lack of consequential semantic content. "

Thank you, Alan, Jeffrey, Bob and everybody else for your responses. I was more concerned, actually, with establishing a long existing history of syntax/punctuation poetry than criticizing a particular poem. Since everybody involved seems to be aware of this, we can move on to other topics.

Best,
Igor S.

Richard. (and others).  If Plath had had no children, would her suicide
have been as wrong?  Would we discuss John Berryman's suicide in the same
manner, viz. Mr. Jullich's claim that Sylvia is to suicide what Paul

And Lacan, I believe, considered suicide an acceptable response to that pain.
 Those who carry on, who choose life!  obviously aren't feeling the same
level of pain.  That level  must be damn high to override the instinct toward
self-preservation, in any case.  Perhaps character has something to do with
how such pain is mediated, with one's defenses, etc.  Still, those things are
wired into us via genetics, general environment, parents, education, and the
like.  They are not individual choices.  But what do I know?  These issues
are better left to the experts in the field.  Best, Bill

Hi everyone, if you will be in San Francisco on Sunday August 5, and
are not going to be going to the estimable Del Ray Cross/Drew Gardner
event at Canessa Park at 3 o'clock, then please come and see me,
Kevin Killian, I will be part of this other event on the other side
of town at exactly the same time!!  It is the debut of "Boys Club,"
the new queer male spoken word series intended by its organizers to
be a kind of counterpart to the "Sister Spit" events here.  Anyway
this is the first, it's at Cafe du Nord

2170 Market between Church and Sanchez

You have to be 21

It costs 3 dollars

3:00 p.m. and I will be reading along with Mario Balcita, the poetry
slam king whose work I read first in "Revolutionary Voices" the queer
youth spoken word anthology, and also with Kirk Read, author of "How
I learned to snap," Kirk is to writing what Josh Hartnett is to
acting, i.e., oh, God, what does it matter what his writing is like.
And I Kevin will be there launching my new book

"ARGENTO SERIES" from Krupskaya Books.  Hope to see you there.  -- KK.

Nah.  At the end of the day there's either work that's engaging

I prefer learning the rules by breaking them (not the same as 1st learning
the rules and then breaking them).  Accident is a wonderful way to learn.
It worked for me as a child and it's still working.  By operating in this
manner I can toss aside the rules that seem useless, superficial or based in
the reinforcement of arbitrary and/or redundant power structures.  When I
was a little kid I would like all kids do something wrong, but I'd negotiate
my way out of punishment in a calm rational manner by demonstrating that I
knew what was wrong and that I wouldn't repeat the action.  Such a tactic
always worked--I wouldn't get punished and I wouldn't do the same thing
again.

To say that the past is pointless is too much brains and too little heart
(to throw it all away and make a fresh start...).  When you think about it,
to throw everything away is so naively Maoist.  I mean, Pol Pot wanted to
start all over, at year zero, two million bodies in anonymous heaps of dust
and flies.  The logical extreme of such thinking is frightening.  If that
were not so scary I'd be laughing right now.  Besides, it's hard for me to
find anything that is taking place NOW.  Every time I look at something,
anything, it's already in the past.  Even this sentence started before now.

Learning a rule doesn't mean you have to follow it; I find it valuable to
sometimes appreciate, converse with, or just be aware of what's happened in
the past, and that includes everything up to now.  Having said that, poetry
doesn't really have rules.  Guidelines, yes, but guidelines can be ignored.
Besides by the time we're aware of anything, we're already outside it.
Consciousness *in medias res* seems an achievement of superheroic
proportion.   Consciousness is being aware of that which has already
happened.  (Not a definition but a limitation.)  You can't avoid the past in
your perception of the present.

I find the analogy between being completely ignorant of cultural precedents
& guidelines and cowboys stunningly appropriate.  Manifest destiny, rootin'
tootin' & shootin' dem injuns and wetbacks, back, back, back, way back, make
way for the brave new world.  If this were more funny than depressing I
would laugh.

I don't know if students would need to be "drilled" but it's probably a good
thing to show relatively uninitiated students what people have been doing
with poetry across time and space, which of course includes contemporary
writers & cowboys.  I would guess that 99% of Americans born in the 20th
century are uninitiated with poetry (even if 10% actually writer what they
call "verse").  Besides, drillin's for oil.

I never took one single poetry class in my life.  take my example as you
will, pro or con.  to *know* the forms, to be able to talk the talk, isn't
important, but to be able to work through the forms, to stumble across them,
to accidentally conjure them, now, THAT'S something you cannot teach.  You
want it/you got it or you don't.  What I'm saying sounds perhaps even more
severe than what you said.  Also, some people do not write according to
form.  For many poets, a form is something the poem takes in its later
revisions (think implementation as opposed to creation).  If the workshop is
focused on creativity (the bitten apple), there might be little need for
much discussion of form.  If the workshop is based on implementation (the
polished apple), then form might be very important.  but artists aren't
technicians and it's important for the teacher to remind a student, say,
what a dactyl looks like.  To just shrug off the possibility that someone
hasn't been thinking of writing poetry in such technical terms is naive.  If
a teacher wants to teach then s/he's going to have to lead and leading
people is often a pain in the ass.  rightfully so.

i would make sure every poetry student of mine had a copy of Ron Padgett's
_Handbook of Poetic Forms_, the OED UNABRIDGED, and tell them to get old
beaten up copies of their favorite books and literally tear into them, pull
out the parts that make them laugh or cry or come or scream or get angry.
The stuff that moves them.  oh, yeah, and pen and paper.

I may have been the closest to saying such a thing, and I can assure you, I
never said that they lack character or were irresponsible.

I deal with suicide very day of my life.  It's ALWAYS there.  I feel like an
alcoholic who doesn't drink.  I did mean to say that one can guide his/her
pain and not just go running into it, embracing it like some literary honor.
And I say that with full fear of the possibility that sometimes the suicide
cannot be resisted.  I criticized Sexton in my selfish way because I saw her
running towards situations where she would be more suicidal, and she was
doing it deliberately, and I'm scared of that.  It's tempting, but it's
naive.  But then, Sexton was also likely histrionic (borderline personality
disorder) as well as manic depressive and so she may have not been able to
resist running towards the suicidal "glories".  In 2001 we are more aware of
bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and so they can be
helped.  Admittedly not in all cases.

Best,
Patrick

susan, the situation you describe is very real in fact---the tyranny of
consensus, as it were...

one observation:  no instructor can every entirely relinquish authority...
the move toward democratizing the classroom, then, doesn't presume
powerlessness---on the part of instructors *or* students... anymore than
the institution within which power is conferred is powerless... so there
are times when it's the instructor's call---and what you describe seems to
be one of those times...

when i step in like that mself, those unfortunate enough to be enrolled in
my classes typically moan audibly... they *know* i've just pulled rank...

ira shor, for one, has advocated turning even textbook choices over to
students... i can just imagine someone making the argument that the REALLY
radical thing to do would be to entirely commandeer all student activities,
and return (?) to a strictly top-down hierarchy... i want to be resolute
here in maintaining that kass and i are not advocating a "middle ground" or
some such between these two (ostensible) approaches... we believe that
shor's techniques are part & parcel of the the ideology that we're after,
even if we employ a different sense of structure (and whatever the
classroom contingencies)...

the point is to shift responsibilities and so forth in the direction of...
it's not any less radical for that---and of course, as has been argued for
years now, advocating a more democratic (let's say) approach to the
classroom is *advocating*... it's a moral choice, in effect, if also a
totality of sorts ("all totalities are not totalitarian")... the nice
aspect of doing so, as i say, is that students get to have a voice in
talking about how they're being educated (as opposed, again, to top-down,
and usually lecture-mode, pedagogies, where students never actually get to
question how they're learning, or being taught)...

now there's something of a theoretical hitch here, and depending on your
theoretical druthers, you can end up chasing your tail on this one... it
goes like this:  "but how is someone operating within any structure *ever*
entirely cognizant of said structure?"...

well that's the case all the way around... we're not suggesting we don't
challenge ourselves to better our approach to teaching every blasted day...
but we do hope that our students too are willing to participate in same...
those that aren't, well---there are many more orthodox classrooms on our
campus (i include creative writing of course in this assessment) than there
classrooms of the sort we advocate for... so i tell students pretty much
straight out, in my first class---"this is in effect the law... within this
law, there is all sortsa room for movement... the law itself may be
critiqued, but i'll expect everyone to abide by same for the sake of the
class... if you have any problems with this, bail now..."

ysee, very authoritarian sounding, no?... my bark is a bit worse than my
bite, sure, but i want to be certain that everyone understands their
responsibility---not just to me, but to one another... within six weeks or
so, most of the writers in my classes begin to dig the power that comes
with answering---not just to me but---to one another (some dig it too
much!)... i call this liberating... but whatever you call it, it has the
makings of community (term used advisedly), of asking of and answering to
one another...

there's another problem too, which i hinted at via my passing reference to
the "unreconstructed" in my last post... has to do with whether you see the
classroom as a place of conversion, of (strictly speaking now) oppositional
rhetorics... we don't, though we agree (see our note 14) that this is a
"bind" we face, given our stated motives... we anticipate marxist critique
specifically along the lines of how presumably week-kneed we critical
pedagogues are in this regard...

btw, just to be sure i'm not being misunderstood:  i've learned lots from
more traditional instructors... i can't say i'd wanna teach the way they
do---but by way of saying that there are many ways to learn... also, we're
not evaluating whether instructors are "good people" or "bad
people"---we're talking about their instructional commitments...

in any case, we're asking students (and for that matter, faculty!) who
resist us to find constructive ways to articulate said resistance... and we
hope not simply to cater to those who (on first glance) "see things our
way" (one of us now teaches in the cu honors program, and we've taught
students across the academic spectrum---so needless to say, even those

tom, kass and i are both more interested in turning out good writers than
good writing...

does that get somewhat at what you're saying?... when i use "good," i mean
it in the largest ethical sense possible... we're interested in the whole
enchilada, but for us this includes the disciplinary whole, as paradoxical
as that may sound... and for us this means trying to get away from the
self-saturated, merely expressive individual (though expressing isn't such
a bad thing, neither!)...

as to what folks need to know before they enter any profession (incl. the
profession of creative writing):  well let's see... for me it was a dual
degree in math and mechanical engineering... seven years as an engineer in
two fortune 500 companies (and an engineering license in ny state)... for
kass it was, among other things, administrative manager and producer at
central pennsylvania youth ballet...

this vita material not to authorize, but to indicate that we didn't write
that piece with only academic backgrounds behind us...

but what if we did?... what if we experienced poverty, divorce, death,
aging, grief, joy, and so forth, and perhaps just as important to the
argument i'm making, found bracing ways (miraculously?) to articulate such
experiences at a young age?...

granted, living some counts... but then again, some folks i know who are
now in their 60s seem to have lived very little... how this becomes one's
art is surely a messy affair...

and along these lines, academic prereq's can only ever approximate, and
often in some startingly unuseful ways (!), the question of what one needs
to know to benefit from thus & so instruction... for us the key is to
consider the history of a given practice, along with a reasonable (if not
exactly statistical) survey of what's going on now in higher ed... that'll
surely speak somehow to what might be learned, when... and generally, it
seems to us that students will reach for more if encouraged to---but this
requires shaking off some of the k-12 dust... in any case (and not that
anyone sd so, but---) i don't exactly anticipate making the matter of prior
knowledge yet another means by which to keep students OUT of classes, if
only b/c that would likely play into more orthodox cw logic (see our
"inter/mission")...

again, more a rumination, as i can't say as how this even approximates an
answer to your searching questions---for which i'm again grateful...

best,

I think that poetry is too important NOT to be left to zealots.

This reminds me of a review Peter Quartermain and Richard Caddel's,
Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970 that was hit hard in a Canadian
review. If I remember correctly, the reviewer was also teaching in BC and
the tone was awfully personal. A tactless attack.

Kevin--yes, the assault on _Other_ was in the _Antigonish Review_ 120....I
forget the name of the author.  That said, while it was certainly a
cretinous & malicious piece which evidently grew out of personal differences
with Quartermain, it's hard for me to imagine that the review makes much
difference in the reception of _Other_, given that I can barely find anyone
in Canada who's read the _Antigonish Review_, let alone in the States or the
UK.  The impact of _Poetry Review_ is a litle harder to gauge: it's quite
ubiquitous (most university libraries subscribe), as a glossy organ with
near-official status given its asociation with the Poetry Society; but as
with a lot of such supposedly prestigious journals I wonder if anyone not
published or reviewed in its pages actually reads it.

Dear Susan,

These ideas about the limits of democracy in the classroom are interesting I
think, and I relate to them not as a teacher or student, but because I run a
mailing list for discussion of poetry.

It's funny how when an unpopular or difficult decision like kicking someone
off the list has to be made, there are sometimes cries of 'censorship' and
'undemocratic'- well not on my list so far, but I've noticed it elsewhere.

This interests me because democracy is often seen as somehow opposed to
rules and rule-making, whereas I think of rules as central to democratic
freedom.

I guess the question is whether the rules are pointless/ beaurocratic or
whether they help people know the parameters of a group, its purpose etc,
and how organic and consultative and adaptive they are to a group's needs.

I don't know how any of this relates to a classroom but I do think that the
word democracy is often poorly defined, and seems pretty open to discussion.


Best wishes

Or they think there's nothing else to do: there may well be a solution to
the "problem" they have. Obviously there are many reasons - maybe some ae
valid possible someone in a terminal state or real "no way out otherwise
with dignity" situation, but there are probably many that are "reversible".
One case: a friends mother gassed herself in her car but there was evidence
that she changed her mind and tried to escape from the situation (too late).
I was rather unsupportive (in  my opinion which I kept to myeslf) of that
woman. I myself am determined to face death suffering despair with as much
courage as I can. Sure, there are some very horrifying examples of
suffering: but I cant see Plath quite in that category. Responsibilty  DOES
come into it. We ARE RESPONSIBLE to our children and those we love and or
love us. No compromise or argument on that. Richard Taylor.

Wystan and the List. Yes, an interesting take. Is that from "A Poetics" ?
I'm reading that currently as well as some Swinburne and some Chekov! Oh and
a book of Perec's non fiction or so-called non fiction howwever we classify
these things...What a mixture! And a book about Defence and attack by
animals, and...I agree with the comment...mind you Bernstein reserves or
gives others leave (how big of him! (my little joke)) to make "extravagant"
statements that are maybe "wild" or "inaccurate" but are part of what that
writer/ poet is....Ammonides might be leading back toward the questions of
form etcwhich we discussed and is still worth discussing.....So eg someone
could come back with  "You CANT play tennis with the nets down"...one could
ferociously debate that and/or it becomes a kind of focal or revolving point
for thought.....Just my response for now thoughts of a sometimes dry
brain....Regards, Richard. PS It took me a long time to abandon (I still
havent completely) lineated poetry...I like justification (I mean as the
word processor does it) hence the term...JUSTIFIED text...and so on...must
be some significance there...even spend (too much) time "correcting" my
emails: Habits. Habits. Habits.habits habits habits habits H a B it s  Have
a habit. Have itz? Noe habbittt.   Habblit. Hazzlitt......and so on and on
and on.. "Inhabit a habit and you become a rabbit." Second regards.

Ammonides. Can one graduate a sudent of creative poetry...maybe: but I think
that poetry etc is in a different category to music (maybe not) as we learn
the rules more or less as we grow. Both as small children learning the
language then at school and so on and by reading. But I dont think it
matters that the old terza rima or iambics etc are or are not known...may be
as long as: and this is the trouble people become obsessed with being
"correct" but in Creative Land there is no correct. The teacher could say:
these are the rules this is the history here is a book of prosody here is
writer(s) A B C etc but no one wants the implication that one HAS to learn
rules unless one WANTS to learn they rules. "Learned all they rules so 'e
could break 'em" to self quote. Or didnt learn them....maybe learn or be
conversant with ideas and methods and "takes" but encourage freedom and play
with language: encourage having fun. To hell with canons and correctness and
orthoctology and straightness! "Damn braces, bless relaces.." Its the
unconventional or "lateral" and independent mind we want...not rule bound or
"politically correct" or canononical a la Bloom (whom I shot out of a real
cannon in a previous post bless his soul spelt with a "u").  May the Force
be with you'all! Regards, Richard.

The rigged missile defense test

The target destroyed in the "successful" defense shield test
contained a global positioning satellite beacon that made it easier
to detect. Why has the media mostly ignored the story?

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Joe Conason

July 31, 2001 | The Pentagon and the Bush administration are determined to
sell the American people a national missile defense system that will
probably increase tensions with allies and
adversaries and will surely cost more than $100 billion. Their latest
marketing exercise took place on the evening of July 14, when a "kill
vehicle" launched from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific smashed into a
rocket sent up from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Precisely according to plan, the target was instantly vaporized on impact --
and along with it, or so the Pentagon's uniformed salesmen hoped, the
perennial concern that missile defense won't work. With the cooperation of
major news organizations and conservative pundits, that test provided an
enormous propaganda boost to the Bush proposal, which
conveniently enough had been brought up to Capitol Hill by Defense
Department officials just two days earlier.

There was only one thing that all the happy salesmen forgot to mention about
their latest test drive. The rocket fired from Vandenberg was carrying a
global positioning satellite beacon that guided the kill vehicle toward it.
In other words, it would be fair to say that the $100 million test was
rigged.

No wonder, then, that Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, the Air Force officer
who oversees the NMD program, told the Washington Post on them eve of the
test that he was "quietly confident" about the outcome. The general knew
about the GPS beacon, while the reporters didn't.

This rather significant aspect of the July 14 mission remained hidden in the
fine print until a few days ago, when the Pentagon confirmed the role of the
GPS device to a reporter for Defense Week magazine. But of course most
Americans still don't know why the test functioned so smoothly, because the
Defense Week scoop was either buried or ignored by the mainstream media,
which had so obediently celebrated the technological breakthrough two weeks
earlier.

And as Kadish later acknowledged, each of the previous three tests -- two of
which failed anyway -- had also involved the use of a guidance beacon. (To
longtime observers of the missile-defense effort, this latest news recalled
the notorious "Star Wars" scandal, when investigators discovered that a
target had been secretly heated to ensure that it would be picked up by the
interceptor's infrared sensor.)


Reuters was among the few news organizations that bothered to cover the
Defense Week story. The wire service quoted a Pentagon official who
"conceded that real warheads in an attack would not carry such helpful
beacons." Probably not, although we can always hope that the Iranians or the
North Koreans or the Chinese will attach to each incoming nuke a loudspeaker
that screams "come and get me!"

Unfortunately, weapons experts agree that even the most primitive enemy
missiles are more likely to carry a very different kind of accessory,
namely, decoys designed to fool the computerized sensors aboard the kill
vehicle.

While the missile launched from Vandenberg on July 14 did spit out a single
Mylar balloon as a symbolic decoy, that scarcely challenged the kill
vehicle's capacity to select the correct target -- particularly because
there was no GPS beacon on that shiny balloon. In real warfare, an incoming
missile is expected to deploy multiple decoys of varying shapes and sizes to
lure the kill vehicle astray. Past tests have indicated that these simple
fakes work far more reliably than
the complex technology designed to detect them.

Eventually, the truth about the inherent problems of national missile
defense may emerge in congressional hearings. But meanwhile, the Pentagon
and the Bush White House mean to stifle any dissent about the capabilities
of their favorite toy. They have repeatedly sought to
reclassify documents that show that the system doesn't function as
advertised. And within the past few weeks, they have blatantly attempted to
intimidate Theodore Postol, aprofessor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who is the country's leading critic of missile defense.

In early July, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, Defense
Department officials asked MIT to confiscate the reclassified report from
Postol and to "investigate [his] actions." At first MIT president Charles
Vest, no doubt worried about millions of dollars in defense
research grants to his university, moved to comply with that request. Only
when Postol protested publicly did MIT back down.

Bogus tests and bullied critics are the hallmarks of a defense establishment
that fears facts. With billions in contracts at stake and bellicose
ideologues in power, the salesmen for national missile defense must conceal
the many defects in their dangerous product. And the press corps, reverting
to the bad habits of the Cold War, has done little so far to penetrate the
Pentagon's propaganda.

So when the next "successful" missile-defense test is announced with fanfare
and fireworks, don't necessarily believe what you hear. You are the buyers
targeted by this massive sales effort -- and you should most certainly
beware.

One final safety consideration involves the psychological effects that these
games can trigger, including disorientation, anxiety, illusory motion
sensations (persistent feelings that one is climbing, falling or flying long
after the game is over), perceived disturbances in the visual field
(hallucinations and after-images... er... ahem!), inappropriate reflexes and
disrupted motor control. Astoundingly enough, consistent use of these
programs creates new neural pathways in the brain — connections that may not
be appropriate paths for brain impulses to travel in real-life situations.
(Technology Review mentions a woman who, after using a virtual program
designed to show the inside of the human body to doctors and medical
students, became so disoriented that shortly afterwards, while drinking from
a can of soda, poured soda into her eyes rather than her mouth. After years
of anecdotal evidence that fighter pilots trained in flight simulators were
experiencing flashbacks and disorientation while driving their cars, and a
study that concluded that 14% of helicopter pilots trained in simulators
reported motion sickness, and yet other studies that found flashbacks,
disorientation, and balance disturbances that lasted for up to 12 hours, the
Army, Navy and Marines have decided to ban driving or flying for 24 hours
after the symptoms subside in people who have experienced cybersickness.)

2River today released its latest addition to the 2River Chapbook Series,
SEX WITH TREES AND OTHER THINGS EQUALLY RESPONSIVE, a collection of 18
poems by Rebecca Lu Kiernan, in which she conveys the delicious misery of
being on the verge of satisfaction. I hope you have the time to read it on
one of these summer afternoons. Just follow the link below to 2River, where
you'll see an announcement of the new chapbook.

Since 1996, 2River has been a site of poetry, art, and theory, quarterly
publishing THE 2RIVER VIEW and occasionally publishing individual writers
in the 2River Chapbook Series.

AT&T's research lab has a program that converts text into speech (options:
male, female, child -- gives you a new sense of gender variety). You can
insert up to 30 words of text and it will "read it aloud." Your system needs
Java and a soundcard.

You can hear your poetry in ways that you never imagined,

Bob Grumman writes:

"Maybe I'm tired right now, but it seems to me your (sic) just arguing
against institutions having too much power."

Uh huh.

Both Bob & Bill Austin point out that hierarchies are inevitable.  On this
point they won't get much disagreement from me, though Bill says that, like
me, he is not "happy" about it.  Bob on the other hand is positively
chipper: he doesn't just believe that hierarchy is inevitable, but (in the
case of the canon, at least) he's all for it!  Of course the canon includes
many terrific poets whom I would never dispute; and of course, as Bill
points out, it has broadened & is broadening all the time-- whichever canon
one refers to, & I think there are a few loose variants out there.  Which is
all to the good.  But then why do I get so darned uncomfortable when Bob
states, with surprising candor, "Of course, I pretty much agree with the
English-speaking canon before 1900.  Who from before then has been
discovered who was really any good?"  Now a couple of problems leap to my
mind with this statement.  First of all, it presumes that everything HAS
been discovered-- that some, & maybe a lot of it, hasn't permanently been
lost.  I don't feel nearly as confident as Bob on this point.  Secondly, &
regardless of what might have been lost, Bob's statement can be paraphrased
as saying that literary achievement before 1900 was almost exclusively the
domain of white men, & that after 1900 (since Bob doesn't like Dickinson but
presumably does like Stein) it suddenly changes to include at least one, or
maybe a few, major women (depending on what you think of Niedecker, Moore,
HD, Loy, Riding Jackson, Barnes, et. al.)  Since like Bob I don't want to
keep "batting" this around ad nauseum, I'll just let this assertion stand
without further comment.

There are a couple of things though that I would like to say specifically to
Bob.  I never argued that one doesn't need to differentiate between good and
bad poetry; and though I disagree with you that the canon is always such a
useful tool for doing that (how helpful is it, after all, to have this
received body of work about which you don't have to THINK very hard, at
least in terms of whether it's any good) I won't belabor the point here.
Nor do I feel that my post had anything whatsoever to do with good medical
practices, or the authorship of Shakespeare's works, to name two topics that
somehow crept into your reply.  I guess on these matters, as on a few more,
we'll just have to agree to disagree.

In closing, I can only express my amazement that any sign of dissatisfaction
with the politics of canon formation was controversial, on a list with a
large percentage of working poets.  But this list never fails to provide
surprise and delights.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go back to
hitting the delete button, er, snooze alarm.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi Gary, when I posted my little list earlier I hadn't yet read your longer
post -- I really enjoyed your thoughts on Bromige's work, and that space of
allowing different voices/modes/whathaveyou. It always sits strange how
differently ones poems can turn out, and I expect it's the same with
children (not to get in another gender muddle).
What I am most glad to see you pointing to is the idea that a POV can be
expressed in so many ways, editorially. Maybe, to go back to Ron's original
note, which I don't entirely disagree with, one way of expressing a POV, a
politic, a stance, is to make a gathering, which Ron dismissed as "just a
gathering". It's fine with me if some mags want to express their
POVs/purposes in an upfront editorial way, but I also recognize other ways
of expressing same. Not every political activist uses a loudspeaker, or
whatever, so to speak.
Eliz.

zoo, minima moralia


zoo functioning as an inverse concentration camp - the animals are ideally
reproduced in their conservation ur-environments; they ideally reproduce
in such environments; they are protected against the external violence of
humans. but they are displayed, not in terms of relation, for the audience
we watched and rewatched, but as individual isolates, spectacles; all con-
nections were permanently broken, and the violence - especially of the
children - was evident, as if it repeatedly struck the incarcerated
bodies. the earth sends minor populations into condensation; we harvest
and transfigure our destruction of habitat. but the obscene remains and
intensifies - the violence carries no message but that of momentary stasis
as animals cower as far from glass or mesh as possible - or else pose
obsequiously in the hope of junk food engorgement.

in the camp which is the zoo we watch our triumph over the demise of the
planet; we watch the idiocy of our triumph; we watch the spectacle of
destroyed cultures of any species not our own. in the camp which is the
zoo we attempt the resurrection of the end of life; one can watch with
horror at the gaping human mouths and screams staring at the last few
members of one or another species; in the camp which is the zoo, we find
the technological triumphant over each and every last bit of tortured
flesh on earth. everything is identified, tagged, labeled; the spectators
would like, as one said, nothing better than a taste of flesh killed as
fast as possible, offered up for a last hideous meal.

coda

to reproduce until a plateau of stability is realized, but for what end;
the human monsters want nothing more than their share of the game. lock
the zoos; keep out of national parks and forests; return wildlife refuges
to whatever environment is left. the zoo might flourish without that
gaping audience; some sort of semblance of life might finally be returned
to one or another abandoned spot of earth. better yet - to cleanse the
world of humans who created this disaster in the first place, transforming
the planet into one great concentration camp of final and irrevocable
extinction.

I don't think it's fair or relevant to judge someone as a poor parent
because they took their own life. Plath's life was her own, to use as she
wished, and it is strange to me that the details of her life in particular
seem 'in the public domain'.

I don't think suicide is glamourous, and of course it shouldn't be
supported, but people should.

'Unfeeling' is not a word many associate with Plath's poetry- which, in the
end is all we have to go on, since she's not here to tell her side of
things- and it is odd to see that word next to 'confessional'.

Which is she- the tell-all poetess that is dismissable, or the coldly
brilliant writer?

I'd suggest she was a person, just like us, and on that note I'll humbly bow
my head, partly in order to duck.

Cheers,

Cassie


|  Elizabeth, It's natural that people should talk about Plath  AND her
|  children. Let's be open or "confesional" : it has been said that suicide
is
|  highly irresponsible, and highly unfeeling of others who are close or
|  associated with oneself.

I despair at any categorisation of suicide. And too at discussions of
whether anyone was 'right' or 'wrong' to do so. As if there were marks out
of ten.

Just to imagine, and we are all supposed to be imaginative, what it must
take for an anyone to end their world, to voluntarily close all the curtains
forever, should be sufficient to wake a little humility on this subject.
Successful suicide is an act without encore, nor the pleasure of good
reviews, and I would not dare comment on it. If you've ever felt that
terrible tug, even if for an instant, you'd know what terrible terra
incognita it contains.

Best

My son and four of his friends are starting a punk rock band (this one has an
oboe in it hooked up to some digital contraption-- they are good, have alredy
been asked to play with God's Reflex, a pretty well-known band in underground
circles, at gigs in Chicago-- The Bowl and Metropole).

They've been trying to come up with a good name, and have been getting into
disagreements over the issue. These guys are pretty sophisticated 16-18 year
old Genoa anarchist types: Three names which I've suggested, "Oedipus and the
Motherfuckers," "Bataille's Thing," and "Fake Pessoa," have all been rejected
as "too pompous" or "pushy" (though I know their knowledge of the last two
figures is slight). I told them that I would query the Poetics list for
suggestions and they enthusiastically agreed that I should.

Any imaginative suggestions (but not "pompous" ones)? Any ideas appreciated.

Just a note to say I've read Mark's response to my post
and don't feel like going further into the many points he
raises.  I will admit to being politically-incorrect, though.

Ahh, David, I dare you and George to name someone who's STILL ALIVE!
"Michel Angelo" and Blake are, well, safe, aren't they?  I agree with both
of you.  But name someone who's still alive, and then we'll have a position
on contemporary greatness.  So I dare you, no, I DOUBLE-DARE you.

I do feel a discomfort like Dodie with the term "great," but not only
because is it such a heavy-handed and sophist word, but also because it is
usually reserved by people who have already passed social and cultural tests
of approval (which normally take a great deal of time).  So the word "great"
does make me squirm, not so much to hear it, but to use it certainly is
uncomfortable.

Thanks guys in advance for indulging me.  I'm serious; I'm not trying to be
antagonistic in the least.  Prodding, yes, antagonistic, no.

Best,
Patrick

It must be nice to be so confident of one's sanity and unselfishness
to feel free to judge acts of self-destruction. I'm sure Plath intended no
personal offence to you.

I think that love makes us human, not pain, and perhaps we should extend a
little love Plath's way, if  the details of her life must be picked over.

Pain is something I prefer to avoid, and if the world was nothing but pain I
can imagine I'd prefer to exit it.

Radical eh?

Best,

Cassie

there's no way anyone can judge what else anyone else has to go through--

I've seen people who struggle to stay alive everyday with things like a
bi-polar diagnosis and it is no small thing to do survive each day. Any one
who has been close to anyone struggling with mental illness would know this

critiques of selfishness are far too simplistic

A program called Simple Text, which you can find on most Macs, does the same
thing.  There are several variant "voices" to choose from-- none of which
sound very natural.  I don't believe there is a word limit.

David. I agree. Maybe because I am thinking of my own children...that's
where it gets you in the gut: that's basal...one's own and then the feeling
and concern goes to others. But the word "responsibility" and other
attitudes can become too stffly judgemental. I'm as cotradictory and as
"crazy" as anyone else. I agree. We must live, but let's be compassionate.
Christ knows what hell went through Sylvia to take her own life or anyone
else.... as I wrote once "What horror does the smotherd scream, the twisting
of the limbless hope, the dessicated death". But maybe that's rhetoric. Yes.
Humility. A good word for me. I need some. Thanks, Richard.

I remember the bands back when as having THE placed before their names, ala
The Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Dead Kennedys, The Buzzcocks, The Exploited,
The Avengers, Etc.  I therefore make the following likewise suggestions:

1) The Compulsions
2) The Ends
3) The Means
4) The Hormones

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

> bull... suicide is selfishness pure and simple,  pain?
> what pain? Pain is what makes us human

Take a person with probable bipolar disorder, pathological
perfectionism,  and a history of suicide attempts at an early age. Say
that person has just been through a wrenching divorce--assume no
position on the rightness or wrongness of either person; only note that
the divorce Really Sucked. Put this person across an ocean from roots
and family. Give him/her two very small children to look after. Add the
fact that he/she is jobless and chronically physically ill. The result
you may well get is highly unfortunate--but is it a moral crime, or
simply a likely consequence of aggravated illness?

You might go on to make the ridiculous comparison to a 53-year-old man
with a work cycle that alternates between extremely sedentary periods
and intensely demanding physical work. Here, the confounding factors
include obesity, constant tobacco smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, sleep
apnea, and an on-and-off, debilitating smack jones. Throw in congestive
heart failure, and you get another death. In each case there are many
ways that the person might have prevented his or her own death. The fact
remains that the person did not.

Is contempt the most useful response to such deaths? I think it unfairly
colors the reception of a body of work. I also think it's not fair to
whatever in the artist created--and did want to live.

"I read somewhere that 77 percent of all the mentally ill live in
poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued by the 23 percent who are
apparently doing quite well for themselves."

looking back over my posts on the teaching of creative writing:

one of the things that annoys me most about teaching, or, talk about
teaching---despite the value of sharing ideas, knowledge, etc. (all of
which fall under the "lore" category)---is that such a discussion can
quickly devolve into "i do this" & "i do that" & "this is the result"...

which is to say, it can become such a trivial exercise, one that loses
sight of the larger issues... hell, i find even my own posts along these
lines occasionally cloying...

and which is why i'd really prefer it mself were it possible, at least once
in a while, to move the discussion away from one's classroom per se and in
the direction of those issues---the whys of teaching as opposed strictly to
the hows or whats... for me such a discussion necessarily invokes history,
theory, etc... and (if i may):  those 28,000 words that kass and i took a
year to put together are, for the most part, dedicated not to the hows, but
to the whys... in which regard, the paradoxes of democracy (esp. for the
classroom) seem an apt place to start...

best,

joe

Yeah, for instance, Steve Cannon's A Gathering of the Tribes:

http://www.tribes.org/magazine.html

Which is a really great multi-culti mag/performance space/etc. Their stated
mission:

"Through its public programs and publications, A Gathering of the Tribes
creates a performance venue and meeting place for artists and audiences to
come together across all artistic disciplines, all levels of complexity, and
all definitions of difference. In this pan-disciplinary, multi-cultural
environment, artists exchange ideas, create peer relationships and find
mentorship. At Tribes’ gallery and public events, audiences experience the
voices and visions of artists traditionally ignored by mainstream media.
Through Tribes’ publications, readers encounter a unique synthesis of
literature, visual art, criticism and interviews with artists of all kinds."

... and of course what you see there, or anyway what I see there, is that
there is probably no such thing as a purely random gathering or collection.
This is kind of underscored if you go to their Guest Book, which has a
pretty wide range of responses, from glowing praise to really awful, weird
racist epithets.

The fact that they get such a wide range of very impassioned responses would
seem to suggest a very strongly articulated POV ... as Jack Kimball (who
does the wonderful online East Village) just said to me (I'm multi-tasking
here, sorry!): "If a magazine had no point of view at all, the response
would probably be one of complete indifference ..."

I have this whole theory about mags & their personalities, which I think
become more evident over time, but I'll save it for now ...

Thanks, Elizabeth, for the lovely post ...

Gary

    In this week's Publishers Weekly (July 23, 2002, p. 70) there is a =
review of
    Nova, by Standard Schaefer. I've reprinted the review below.

    Once again, we offer subscribers of this list a 20% discount. Send a =

   =20
    By turns bizarre, trendy and loveable, Schaefer's National Poetry =
Series-winning debut
    takes some of its bearings from the language writing of the '70s and =
'80s and jostles
    among their more recent, more lyrical and often racier heirs. Of =
these three sequences, "Fort"
    inches and backtracks toward a vivid, almost Faulknerian portrayal =
of spaces along
    the Mexico-U.S. border, "where aunts are obvious," Spanish is spoken =
and "there's
    a new south rising against the sliding glass / of a dead language." =
"Ovalness"attacks
    the modern economy and the roles of "employer" and "occupant," and =
cryptically
    warns "The bald one-- / will turn out badly." By far the longest =
sequence, "Nova Suite"
    interleaves angels, birds, cars, highways, "paper doilies," particle =
physicists, "atoms of
    a lost identity" and a web of mock-academic footnotes. Schaefer's =
title invokes at once
    America's nuclear program and its automobile industry, whose =
products behave like
    chemical elements-- "Saturns or Plymouths are inert," while a Chevy =
Nova (Spanish for=20
    "doesn't go") may bear cosmic dangers. The first two, shorter =
sequences are by for
    the stronger work here, and may be the most recently written. If so, =
they presage further
    lyrical damage to come.

Ahh Mark, and there's textaloudmp3, which my pal Lester uses.  But neither
simpletext nor textaloud nor any of the microsoft speech engines (or any of
the other tools out there) replicate "natural" speech quite as well as what
Ron shared, at least to my knowledge.  That AT&T application truly is a
quantum leap down into the abyss of making love to machines.  Orgone sieve,
money sponge.  "Gee, I just, well, never feel, uh, quite *right* afterwards,
you know?"

I prefer the ones that sound fake, especially because they read in regular
time.  (Hint)

Thank you to all the people who wrote b-c with ideas-- unexpected and the boys are thrilled, though now the issue has become extremely complicated for them. Here is what I have received b-c so far, and many of these were regarded as terrific. Yesterday, three of the band members were looking over my shoulder as I looked through the Poetics archives, and one of them said, "Is anybody on here more or less famous?" And I said that yes, in the world of poetry, and I gave him some names off the top of my head. So he said, "Hey what about something like just "Kevin Killian", or "Charles Bernstein," or "Silliman, Ron", or "Kevin Killian Loves Jordan Davis," or etc. (Three of the band are gay, so all the names mentioned in this vein were male, I think.

So, they are considering some of the above, plus one that for the moment seems to be the front-runner:
"The Homosocials."

OK, here are the wonderful suggestions I received, and thanks very much again:

Lick the Blister, Oedipus and the Electric Waist Band, Polity and Prison, Illegitimate Presidents, The Inauthentics, The Flying Kennedys, Socrates Playground, Etch-A-Retch, Streaming Faeces, Yodeldope, Ventilator, Big Smack Happy Meal, Neoplastic Happy Hour, Kidchop, Supertumor, Kung, Argonut, Ergonut, Ergonaut, JennaBush Flop, Seed, Speed (said with French accent: "spEE'-duh"), Dropslop, Butt, Drillcatcher, PLO, Datadrop, Knockwurst, In Advance of the Broken arm, Red Shift, Piss christ, God and the state, Constant Impure Fire, Junkyard Sky, Screm of the Buddha, Now's the Time, Mary Tyler Morphine II, Red Front, The Convulsions, Off the Wall, Next Time the Bathroom, Secret Life of Marcel duchamp, G8 lite (name of radical killed in Genoa), Globalization Fag, Putin's NATO.

Dear Joe Amato,

Yes, Ammonides Diodoros is my real name. The false one on my license and resume is all wrong; it's caused pain everywhere, in the "on-line world" and in my own house. My sons have wept themselves to sleep on twenty-five or thirty-nine nights. I'll never get a job at a research institution. Yannis Ritsos was a teacher of mine. I hate  what the Comintern did to the communist resistance in the mountains. Boulder is one of my favorite cities. Because it must be opened like a cut. A poet kisses her own plaster head. Puts a leg over the shoulder of the other. "Sidewalks of the City" by Lucinda Williams is the greatest song ever. Except for "Which Will". But Meredith Monk is even better. Please respond to me. Because a Creative Writing teacher who can say: "Please forgive me if it is your real name... no hard feelings!" still has so much more to say to others and to himself. Like all of us, distressed in our appellations. I love you, and I love, too, the writing implement held coyly
  !
against your lips. And, frankly,
 I don't give a fuck anymore. There is a kind of hollow pole that connects my name to yours. Through which this post is a kind of dart aimed at your forgiving tongue.

Ammonides

        I say:

Why not just say "Terror Firma" then, and we can all lament the
human condition. With a little dash of pretense?

Postscript:

I remember bands with names like, following the trend of recent
POETICS posts, "Sylvia's Oven", btw.

Good Luck.

Hi Folks,

I'm going to be leading a 10-week private prose workshop at my
apartment this Fall--Wednesday nights beginning September 12, 7 to 10
p.m.  I haven't done this in a while, don't have a group of regulars,
so enrollment is wide open.  Liberal definition of what constitutes
prose.  This is a great place to bring work that feels too edgy for
presentation in a classroom, i.e., sex and weirdness welcome.  No
assignments, unless you want them, you just bring your work and talk
about it.  8 student limit.

If you'd like more info, please backchannel me.

Thanks.

Dodie

"Michel Angelo" and Blake are, well, safe, aren't they?  I agree with

I dunno, screaming faeces seems to similar to scraping feotus or small
faces.  Yodeltrope?  Heliotrope sounds like a metal band, but someone once
said, "What happened to hardcore?  We learned how to play and are metal."
Ventilator is very late seventies.

however, the band is supposed to go through the process, with the idea that
as the naming process, so the career in and as the band, I thought

Thank you!

BUT BUT BUT...no caveats/conditions!

"John Ashbery is great. (Or looms greatly over the second half of the last
> century, at least.)"

Does he merely loom, or is he great, in your opinion?  Confirm! or Deny!
Have courage!  I'd say you'd confirm but may be playing this one too safely,
dear friend.  Yet, ironically, you are being more like a critical daredevil
than any other of the avant radical forks around here....so kudos to you for
making the risky move of your queen.  So again, I'm prodding, not
criticizing.  I'm just asking if you're ready to let go the piece where it
is, and commit to your move, or keep your hand on it & pull it back.
(Herein lies the trouble with "great" and "the test of time" methinks.)

Thanks for indulging me, and let me know if you are committed to "John
Ashbery is great."

I'll TRIPLE DARE ANYONE TO NAME SOMEONE WHO'S UNDER 50 YEARS OLD AND STILL
ALIVE!!!  DOUBLE DARE, STILL ALIVE, TRIPLE DARE, UNDER 50 AND STILL ALIVE.
SINGLE DARE, SOMEONE WHO'S DEAD BUT WOULD BE UNDER 50 IF ALIVE TODAY
(there's safety in death).  TRIPLE DARE, and you get free poetry mailed to
you by me (no I don't mean to DIScourage you).

Patrick

Subject: Police brutality destroys community trust

Minnesota Daily

Police brutality destroys community trust

A friend and I were attacked last Saturday night around 11 p.m. We were
both man-handled and slammed against the trunk of a car. I was pinned to
the car by a stranglehold, and my arm was gashed to the point of requiring
stitches.

The perpetrators? Two members of the Minneapolis police force.

Our crime? Asking a question.

Jef Stout, managing editor of Pulse, and I had been biking near the Walker
Art Center when we passed a group of five squad cars. Curious, we stopped
to ask an officer what had happened. Although we both work for newspapers,
we didn't need the force of the media behind our questions. All citizens
have the right to ask about police procedures, and while officers might
not be obligated to answer, they are in no way justified in responding
with unprovoked brutality.

After refusing to answer our questions and then harassing us over bike
licensing, where only I was in violation, we gave up and began turning
around. However, after one of the officers saw Jef glance at the squad car
number, he suddenly decided to change his mind and arrest us instead.

>From that point on, the situation degenerated into excessive force and
irrational behavior. We were roughed up, patted down, cuffed and thrown
into the back of a squad car. I had to visit the Hennepin County Medical
Center for my injury, and Jef was released around 10 the next morning. We
both were charged with "obstructing the legal process," something we now
have in common with Bill Clinton, the Highway 55 protestors and one of the
Hard Times Café owners.

In summary, two bikers stopped to ask police officers a question and ended
up cuffed, sore and bloody in the back of a police car. What's wrong with
this picture?

As it turns out, we weren't the only victims of police abuse that evening.
That same Saturday night, another young man, Devonsha Thompson, was beaten
by at least five St. Paul police officers after leaving a drill team
competition with about 25 other youths. Police claim he kicked a squad car
several times, swore at them and ran toward one officer. Although
witnesses didn't see Thompson provoke police, they watched in horror as
officers slammed Thompson to the ground, surrounded him and struck him
with their fists, feet, knees and clubs.

Thanks to the immediacy of television reporting and extensive media
coverage, most people readily remember instances of police brutality
involving Rodney King in Los Angeles and the World Trade Organization
protesters in Seattle. But they said they probably don't realize police
brutality is more than just a rare occurrence or an isolated incident.
It's a force to be dealt with across the nation, even in the Twin Cities.
Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton openly admitted this, once stating, "There was
a problem and continues to be a problem of excessive force in this
community. I'm not going to deny that. I grew up here."

In fact, beginning in late 1995, Minneapolis was one of 14 cities involved
in a two and a half year Human Rights Watch investigation into police
abuse. The investigation found persistent police brutality in all the
cities, ranging from sexual assault to murder. Human Rights Watch
documented that police and city officials often protected their own,
denying each new report of brutality and buffering the offender with a
wall of silence. Many officers with long lists of complaints filed against
them, would continue to work on the force, and the little punishment meted
out to abusive policemen was often long overdue. Serious reforms were only
enacted when a brutality case flared into a media scandal.

Why does police brutality persist? Why is there a culture of long-standing
negligence and apathetic tolerance? Probably because police recognize
their protected status. Probably because the system that monitors police
behavior is lax and rarely enforced. Probably because the criminal system
responsible for punishing those who break the laws practically guarantees
impunity to abusive officers. And probably because the most frequent
victims of police violence are racial minorities - the most
socio-economically disadvantaged and marginalized segments of society.

One might argue every human is fallible, and when split-second decisions
must be made in high-stress situations, mistakes are bound to occur.
Police officers' jobs are life-threatening, and in their everyday work,
they must often witness the seedy horrors of life that few of us can even
imagine. Police regularly deal with the scum of humanity, and some of
these officers become personally scarred by their work.

Yet even so, episodes of brutality and abuse cannot and should not be
brushed aside by excuses of "bad days" or "emotional trauma." Violations
of human rights should never be permitted because of personal error or
mere contingencies. Some values must supersede individual circumstances.
Can you imagine if doctors tried to pass off malpractice suits with such
reasons? "I was having a bad day, I overreacted a bit in the operating
room, and whoops, there went your kid's life. Sorry." The doctor would
lose his license faster than a drunk driver. But when cops overreact?
Police chiefs explain, "I think the appropriate amount of force was used."

We, as citizens, entrust the police with upholding and executing the laws
that protect us. Yet we must realize that when we grant them the power to
preserve the law, we also grant them the power to abuse the law.

But does this mean every police officer is guilty of abusing his
authority, violating the rights of innocent citizens? Of course not.
Usually, only a few officers have records of brutality, although those few
corrode the reputation and the public trust of the entire profession. And
when government institutions - especially the police - act without virtue
and without regard for people's rights, they lose credibility and
legitimacy in the eyes of the people.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who now inwardly cringes when I see a police
car drive by.

Pulse of the Twin Cities is running a series of excerpts until Aug. 22
from former Minneapolis police chief Tony Bouza's book, "Unbound:
Corruption, Abuse and Heroism by the Boys in Blue."

OK, I admit it. The second sentence could/might be construed as a
hedge. So I'll say it loud and proud: John Ashbery is great and will
stand the test of time, or my name isn't Patrick Herron.

Hi Poetix & other dears!

Two bits:

My sister and fellow Outlet editress, CAROL TREADWELL, will be reading this
coming Thursday, August 9 at 7 PM, with Sean Dungan & Peter Josephs, at the
UCLA Hammer Museum in a series organized by Benjamin Weissman. She's a
brilliant fiction writer, simultaneously wild & serene, & I do say so myself
as her elder sis. The event is free & more info's at
http://www.hammer.ucla.edu or 310-443-7000. The Hammer's address is 10899
Wilshire Bl, LA (Westwoodish).


Secondly, Double Lucy and I are moving our email address to
eliztj@hotmail.com. Our ISP is shutting down brick by apparent brick,
already I can't receive messages here (so please resend to hotmail if nec)
and suppose our Lucy site will fade away shortly. I will update on its
resurrection.

Thanks!
Elizabeth

Thank you Julie, Gwyn, and Richard! for your lovely posts. Of course when
suicide hits close (as it has twice for me) it is shocking, angering, deeply
saddening and hard to comprehend. But still I love my grandma and my best
friend's step mom, and am simply only sorry and grieving that they ended
their lives in such torture. I am sure if Ms. Sylvia looks down on us at all
it is not with much concern for our opinions of her acts and with a hell of
a lot of concern for her children.

cheerio, E

CAROL TREADWELL is a fantastic writer -- her work's appeared in the
anthologies Snowflake (Smart Art Press), Unnatural Disasters: Recent
Writings from the Golden State (Incommunicado Press), Blind Date (Cal-Arts),
I'm Still in Love with You, Song Poems, as well as Errant Bodies and other
magazines. She might be embarassed that I've added this thus, but don't
blame her for an overeager elder sis, just go check out her reading, if
you're in LA. At the Hammer August 9 (http://www.hammer.ucla.edu)  xx, Eliz

One final safety consideration involves the psychological effects that these
games can trigger, including disorientation, anxiety, illusory motion
sensations (persistent feelings that one is climbing, falling or flying long
after the game is over), perceived disturbances in the visual field
(hallucinations and after-images... er... ahem!), inappropriate reflexes and
disrupted motor control. Astoundingly enough, consistent use of these
programs creates new neural pathways in the brain — connections that may not
be appropriate paths for brain impulses to travel in real-life situations.
(Technology Review mentions a woman who, after using a virtual program
designed to show the inside of the human body to doctors and medical
students, became so disoriented that shortly afterwards, while drinking from
a can of soda, poured soda into her eyes rather than her mouth. After years
of anecdotal evidence that fighter pilots trained in flight simulators were
experiencing flashbacks and disorientation while driving their cars, and a
study that concluded that 14% of helicopter pilots trained in simulators
reported motion sickness, and yet other studies that found flashbacks,
disorientation, and balance disturbances that lasted for up to 12 hours, the
Army, Navy and Marines have decided to ban driving or flying for 24 hours
after the symptoms subside in people who have experienced cybersickness.)

links to info on Ibrahim Tatlises...don't know how good it is.

Funny, Gary, people ARE afraid to argue, and I think that's why discussions
either end up being so predictably placid and dull or completely ad hominem
and brutal.  It seems the comfort level with argument, challenging ideas
without challenging individuals, is often difficult for many.  I miss
getting drunk in the bars of Vienna and Amsterdam, getting drunk with folks
who have different politics than my own, and we'd argue and argue and argue
politics and art and whatnot and buy each other drinks.  That sort of
openness and comfort in argument is something I miss dearly.  Tho' there are
surely many who are capable of such forthright & challenging engagement on
this list.  Not all of us are so predictable.

best,
Patrick

Robert Etal. Hi. If and when suicide is wrong - and how we define wrong  is
problematic itself - I think it is as it affects us as a group: especially
those who most love us or are loved by but also it seems we have a
"responsibility" to tough it out. Look, I dont always feel so bright about
things myself. If I'm criticising those who in deep despair take their own
life it is because I came close to doing just that myself (about 1991 I
think). What stopped me - apart from cowardice or the logical terror of self
extinction - was also the consideration of the responsibility to my own
children and to my mother (who was then alive) my friends and so on.
Gradually I "pulled myself out" of the depression and by using positive
thinking now I never feel depression...malaise, sadness at times, but not
that deep depression. But I do understand...dont worry I know that I cant
judge Plath (whoever or whatever and which Plath was/is that we are trying
to discuss): maybe it's that in anger I could say "no!" but sadly it's too
late. It's good that we talk of these matters. It doesnt diminish for me the
wonderful poetry that Plath wrote: anymore than say discovering that WCW had
some dodgy attitudes to women diminishes his work. Maybe Hitler could have
written great poetry. Who knows? My point when I made it re responsibility
was maybe a working approach we need to take to the whole confessional
"movement" (and that lead to my suggestion that Alan Williamson (in
"Introspection and Contemporary Poetry") had some positive views of or saw
the positive potential both artistically and "therapeutically" of that
movement) and also to certain good and bad romantic concepts that often lead
down bizzarre path ways but do also often genertate "great" or high energy
works: Yeat's crazy ideas, Eliots peccadillos, whatever was wrong with
Elizabeth Bishop, is right/ wrong with me and maybe others on this List and
so on.
  Berryman had at least a responsibility to himself, his students, whatever
women he loved at the time or anyone who cared for...maybe even for those
who had to drag his body - decayed probably - out of a river..maybe to
society. That he had no children possibly makes it seem less irresponsible.
But I use the term "seems"...as in Shakespear "seems is not is".... warily.
  OK I've shifted my position - and given my own doubts and counter
thoughts:  a deep part of me screams out that self destruction is almost
always wrong. Wrong againgst life. That doesnt come from any logic: it is my
feeling. Regards, Richard.

Bill. Good response but: who are the "experts": unkown variables gone to
drips at tap ends? I think we all are: you me, everyone. We have life and
death choices constantly. hand that can "murder or create".  It is an animal

Thank you Cassie and Lisa! Good grief, would we so easily lay blame at the
feet of a mother who died when her children were young because of oh,
disease, accident, etc? Suicide is a sign of debilitating illness or
suffering, guys.
It does strike me that this harsh view of Ms. Plath is rather sexist and
otherwise inhumane.
Elizabeth

"Suppose you were an idiot... And suppose you were a member of
Congress...But I repeat myself." - Mark Twain

On Wednesday night, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a massive
energy bill that fails to promote a clean and secure energy future for the
U.S. Despite faxes from over 40,000 Environmental Defense Action Network
activists urging Congress to oppose the bill unless it was improved, the
energy bill's passage amounts to a giveaway to big oil companies and the
auto industry.

BAD ENERGY BILL PASSES HOUSE:
Specifically, the energy bill would open the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, one of the most pristine
wilderness areas on the planet, to oil drilling, and would ease restrictions
on oil drilling on other public
lands. It also would give away over $30 billion in tax breaks to the oil,
gas and nuclear industries.
What the bill will NOT do is meaningfully address energy conservation. Tax
credits for fuel-efficient vehicles were not improved as we had hoped; as
passed, protection of public health is not assured and some of the most
inefficient vehicles will be eligible for a tax credit. Also, auto industry
supporters defeated an amendment to increase the fuel efficiency standard
for SUVs from 20.7 mpg to 27.5 mpg. Raising fuel efficiency standards would
reduce U.S. oil consumption by up to 1 million barrels a day. That's at
least as much oil per day that would be extracted from the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.

Corporate Globalization and the Poor
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

George Bush has thrown down the gauntlet, issuing a public challenge to
the anti-corporate globalization movement. When hundreds of thousands last
month demonstrated against the G-8 meeting of rich country leaders in
Genoa, Italy, George Bush decried the activists, saying it was the
advocates of corporate globalization who genuinely are seeking to advance
the interests of the world's poor.

It's not enough to mock Bush's pretension of being a defender of the poor
by pointing out that, through his giant tax cut, the president has
overseen one of the history's great transfers of wealth to the rich in
U.S. history. Critics must respond to his claims.

Unfortunately, that turns out to be a remarkably easy challenge to meet.
The last 20 years of corporate globalization, even measured by the
preferred indicators of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
Bank, have been a disaster for the world's poor.

Over the last two decades, Latin America has experienced stagnant growth,
and African countries have seen incomes plummet. The only developing
countries that have done well in the last two decades are those Asian
countries that ignored the standard prescriptions of the IMF and World
Bank.

The Washington, D.C.-based Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR)
has published compelling data comparing growth rates from 1980 to 2000
(during the period of ascending IMF/World Bank power, when countries
throughout the developing world adhered to the IMF/Bank structural
adjustment policy package of slashing government spending, privatizating
government-owned enterprises, liberalizing trade, orienting economies to
exports and opening up countries to exploitative foreign investment) with
the previous 20 year period (when many poor countries focused more on
developing their own productive capacity and meeting local needs).

The results: "89 countries -- 77 percent, or more than three-fourths --
saw their per capita rate of growth fall by at least five percentage
points from the period (1960-1980) to the period (1980-2000). Only 14
countries -- 13 percent -- saw their per capita rate of growth rise by
that much from (1960-1980) to (1980-2000)."

CEPR found that the growth slowdown has been so severe that "18 countries
-- including several in Africa -- would have more than twice as much
income per person as they have today, if they had maintained the rate of
growth in the last two decades that they had in the previous two decades.
The average Mexican would have nearly twice as much income today, and the
average Brazilian much more than twice as much, if not for the slowdown of
economic growth over the last two decades."

A follow-up CEPR study used a similar methodology to look at social
indicators. CEPR found that progress in reducing infant mortality,
reducing child mortality, increasing literacy and increasing access to
education has all slowed during the period of corporate globalization,
especially in developing countries.

The CEPR global comparisons across time show the bottomline, combined
effect of the specific policy components of corporate-friendly policies
imposed by the IMF and World Bank and enforced by free trade agreements.
These include the following:

* Trade Liberalization -- The elimination of tariff protections for
agriculture and industries in developing countries often leads to mass
layoffs and displacement of the rural poor. In Mexico, for example,
opening to U.S. agriculture imports has forced millions of poor farmers,
who find themselves unable to compete with Cargill and Archer Daniels
Midland, off the land.

* Privatization -- IMF and World Bank structural adjustment policies
typically call for the sell off of government-owned enterprises to private
owners, often foreign investors. Privatization is regularly associated
with layoffs and pay cuts for workers in the privatized enterprises.

* Cuts in government spending -- Reductions in government spending
frequently reduce the ability of the government to provide services to the
poor, exacerbating the social pain from rural displacement and industrial
layoffs.

* Imposition of user fees -- Many IMF and World Bank loans and programs
call for the imposition of "user fees" -- charges for the use of
government-provided services like schools, health clinics and clean
drinking water. For very poor people, even modest charges may result in
the denial of access to services.

* Export promotion -- Under structural adjustment programs,
countries undertake a variety of measures to promote exports, at the
expense of production for domestic needs. In the rural sector, the export
orientation is often associated with the displacement of poor people who
grow food for their own consumption, as their land is taken over by large
plantations growing crops for foreign markets.

* Higher interest rates -- Attractive to foreign investors, higher
interest rates exert a recessionary effect on national economies, leading
to higher rates of joblessness. Small businesses, often operated by women,
find it more difficult to gain access to affordable credit, and often are
unable to survive.

Advancing the interests of the poor has nothing to do with the corporate
globalization agenda. This agenda is driven first by profit-seeking, and
second by ideology.

But the corporate globalizers are nothing if not ambitious. They are
seeking now to push fast-track negotiating authority through the U.S.
Congress, to force all of Latin America into a NAFTA-style trade and
investment agreement, launch a new World Trade Organization negotiating
round, and intensify the IMF and World Bank's ability to impose structural
adjustment through a sham debt relief process.

To lessen preventable human suffering, it is imperative that the
protesters continue to build the movement against corporate globalization,
with everything from street protests to citizen lobbying of Congress.

Another world is indeed possible, as the protesters are asserting. But for
now the immediate challenge is to stop the corporate globalizers from
making the existing one worse.

Parkes, M.B., _Pause and Effect: An Introduction to the History of
        Punctuation in the West_. Berkeley: U of California P, 1993.


Over the centuries punctuation has become an essential component of
written language. Its primary function is to resolve structural uncertainties in a
text, and to signal nuances of semantic significance.
                     The importance of the study of punctuation to a
number of disciplines will be widely recognised as a
                     result of the publication of this first definitive
history. The first part of Pause and Effect identifies the
                     graphic symbols and deals with their history. It
covers the antecedents of the repertory of symbols,
                     as well as the ways in which the repertory was
refined and augmented with new symbols to meet
                     changing requirements. The second part offers a short
general account of the principal influences
                     which have contributed to the ways in which the
symbols have been applied in texts, focusing on the
                     evidence of the practice itself rather than on
theorists. The treatment enables the reader to compare
                     usages in different periods, and to isolate the
principles which underlie the use of punctuation in all
                     periods. The examples and plates which are at the
core of the book provide the reader with an
                     opportunity to test the author's observations. The
examples are taken from a wide range of literary
                     texts from different periods and languages. Latin
texts are accompanied by English translations
                     intended to illustrate the use of punctuation in the
originals in so far as this is possible. Pause and
                     Effect is destined to be a standard work. It will
stimulate interest and scholarly debates among
                     writers, literary critics, philosophers, linguists,
rhetoricians, palaeographers and all those who study
                     the use of language.

Nate,
the point i was truing to make wasn't so much concerning size of
readership (although it seems at least you peek at the Antigonish review
the odd time) but rather that certain contemporary UK writing seems to be
the target of a systematic unfair shake.

while i realize that two does not a trend make it does make a something.

cheers,

also there was a plugin called talker which reads pages in a browser
if the page has been prepared to do so. ie you write a .talk file of
what you want spoken and the talker plugin is activated then the page
speaks. unfortunately the world does not operate on macs.

the text to speech function is great to play with, the synthetic
voices will attempt to read anything you write, even if they are not
recognizable words, or even large blocks of text with no punctuation.
you can script to take advantage of this. what's more you can alter
the base and pitch of the voice.
here's somes experiments i did in 1995, 1996, but as i say you have
to be on a mac and have 'talker' installed,

Dear George,


My point was that I don't buy into the mythologising and analysis of Plath's
life, it's just not that interesting to me. Her poems are good, and them I
can learn from.

Why is it such a strange notion to say that Plath was a regular person? I
make that assumption about most people. It is my way of deflating the hype
that surrounds her. What makes her different? The suicide? Unfortunately
that is all too common. The poetry? For sure- but all the theorizing about
her morality I think leads us away from that work, not towards it.

As far as judgements about her parenting etc, it is all about speculation,
isn't it? So why then the need for evidence? I have a distaste for holding
parents responsible for anything and everything, as though their lives
stopped when they had kids, and by extension as though there weren't a
bigger social context for Plath's depression.

But I'm bowing out of this discussion now.

Best from

Cassie

after all the fads are over. Unless you are Peter the Great or
somone. I mean greatness while being alive is mainly a matter of
op[inion in individuals ior groups of individuals. I mean do we know
whether people in the year 2666 will recognize the name Pollock or
Ashbery?

I dont think so. In my life i have known hundeds of people well, and

Nice reference to tsetse, Richard.  But I'm assuming that since they spend
all those years specializing in such matters, psychiatrists know more about
depression, suicide, etc. than do most poets, literary critics and List
posters, including myself.  Maybe I'm nuts but when I get a pain I still see
an MD for his expertise.  The MD may not always be right, but s/he has a
better chance of knowing what went on, goes on, and will go on than I do.
That's all I meant.  Certainly didn't mean to suggest that posters shouldn't
speculate, especially since my next sentence does just that.  Suicide may
indeed be a psychotic episode since it violates the hard wired instinct to
survive.  If that's the case, then even the question of rational choice is
called into question.  As for the moral dimension, in my view suicide is an
ammoral act--so I wasn't really considering that at all.    But again, I'm no
expert so what do I know?

Good to hear from you, Richard!  Hope your life sings.  How's the family?
Best, Bill

Hi yes, the Germ is still going, just got my beautiful and luscious copy of
# 6 with a verylovely cover by Xander Morro, kinda Gorey-ish but more
dollhousey, and it's an issue of French poetry trans by mostly American
poets, including the two very impressive editors, Andrew Maxwell & MacGregor
Card.

Also got LVNG # 9 which has a sporty birdlike cover by Basil King and a
bunch of really fabulous poems by same, my v favorite of which is "The Maids
of Honor 1656". I love how the eds -- Joel Felix and Peter and Michael
O'Leary -- have chosen a grouping of work that to me seems to favor writing
which is using words and phrases as devices, like decorative devices
carrying all these stories and cultural ideas up to our present time. Yes I
like that.

I just had an interesting backchannel from Ralph Wessman which I will wait
to hear from him to see if I can quote from....basically he was taking up
the strand of editorial POVs...and arguing that there needs to be a way of
positively bouncing an idea into the open through publishing, rather than
just "gathering". I hope to post some of this soon and ask that editors on
the list talk about their experience and vision...sounds v interesting to me
and goes with Patrick's idee of good argument, talk.

although he is certainly on the far side of fifty, i would most definitely go
on record as having said that w.s. merwin is GREAT -- and will, without a
doubt, stand the test of time.

i saw him read a few months ago here in san diego, and the man verily took my
breath away with just his presence -- much less that gorgeous work of his. i
was honestly awed...and that doesn't happen everyday.

the bottom line is...they just don't make 'em like ol' william stanley
anymore, goddamnit.   ;)

Dear All, I thought I'd give my 3 or 4 cents to maybe get a conversation
started before I leave to camp for 2 weeks; will definitely listen/read and
respond in the 20s of August.

Enjoy a euro ish lazy august one and all, as I fight the puritanism that
wants me back in the office tmw--

Thought I'd start by mentioning two mags I adore, Gary Sullivan's readme,
which only publishes poems by those who contribute in other ways, thus
asking for conversation (I apologize to ALL for flip interpretations), and
Dodie Bellamy's and Kevin Killian's Mirage/Period(ical) which appears so
often and occasionally, as in their issues for the Page Mothers conference
and a recent one with Pierre et Gilles on the cover around about the time of
Small Press Traffic's fashion/poetry/music show last spring...

Ralph Wessman (of not only Australia but Tasmania I believe;  I also love
Susan Schultz's pacrim Tinfish) sent me a backchannel of which I think the
excerpts below have already been rather public (total apologies if
overstepping, Ralph)in re recent comments of Ron Silliman, Jim Berhle, Gary
Sullivan and self:

 >a comment by Ken Bolton (an
Australian poet, editor and publisher):
 >
 >"Unfortunately most literary magazines are themselves edited along the
lines upon which ... uninformed writers write: an eclecticism fair to all
but unable to select so as to positively advocate systematically or
consistently any particular values. Editors don't seem to be editing as if
there is anything to prove. Imagine a ware of the literary magazines based
on aesthetics - it's unimaginable at the moment."
 >
 >Three editors responded, Jenny Lee, Philip Mead and Martin Ball, and I've
added their comments below.
 >
 >
 >Jenny Lee:
 >
 >Partly it's a practical issue. When you're editing a magazine, unless you
rely on whipping around your mates each time an issue is due - a dubious
procedure ethically, and one that soon reaches a point of diminishing
returns - you're largely depended on what comes in unsolicted, which in turn
depends on the kind of material you publish. If you only publish
well-crafted realist fiction on the theme of male menopause, word inevitably
gets around. Soon the magazine becomes predictable and monochrome; the
readers get bored with it, and so do you. To this extent maintaining a fair
bit of variety is what you publish is simply a survival strategy.

At another level, constantly having to make yes-or-no editorial decisions
forces you to confront your own limitations and prejudices. It's easy to
manufacture 'aesthetic' reasons for rejecting material that you find
uncomfortable; it's much harder to turn the gaze back on your own
taken-for-granted asumptions and try to work out why you find it so
unsettling. I'd prefer to think of the latter approach as pluralist rather
than merely eclectic, as it implies much more deliberate intent.

In fact, I'm not so sure that everyone is as eclectic as Ken is suggesting.
Many magazines at the very least have distinctive house styles, a lot of
which, I suspect, have to do with editorial prejudices and processes of
self-censorshop that are almost subliminal. If they're seldom articulated in
a programmatic way, it's probably just as well.

Certainly it's hard to see any sudden resurgence of the crusading spirit of,
say, Angry Penguins or the early Overland in the near future. For my money
this is no bad thing. Their kind of self-limiting assumptions about what
constitutes 'good writing' can't come close to coping with the diversity of
contemporary literary cultures. When the boundaries between languages
themselves have become so permeable that the question 'how many words are
there in the English language?' is completely unanswerable, it's time to
give up the search for the ideal prose model. In this context, does an
editorial poicy that is consciously pluralist become an easthetic and
political statement in itself?
 >
 >
 >Philip Mead
 >
I can see Ken's point, but I think the landscape has changed, is always
changing. The heady contentious days of the early to mid 70s is another
world. Then, the little magazine and thus literary scene was subject to
certain hegemonies, which meant that opening them out and breaking them
apart was the crucial task. Global contacts and sonsciousness, particularly
in the North American direction, were an important part of that. new Poetry
vs Poetry Australia (a crudely dichotomous eg) was a lining up of certain
ideologies and practices that could hold together behind those two sites of
production. The sublimination of (mostly) masculinist competitiveness and
avant-gardism into "aesthetic" "war" was made possible by the limited
horizons - formak, experiential, aesthetic - of Australian literary culture
at the time. But once the diversification began there's no stopping it. (And
vive la diversification I say.) Today, the concept of "aesthetic war" looks
hopelessly out of date, like a set of toy soldiers from childhood. Nor is it
a mindless eclecticism that rules. it's just that the field of
literaryproduction is so much richer and deeper. It's postmodern, there's no
centre,anywhere's a somewhere:  from daggy little zines produced by loner
writers or tiny coterie groups, to self-consciously "student" publications
like Tangent or Verandah, to the old dinosaurs (Meanjin, Overland, Southerly
etc), to new hybrids like the UTS Review (New Writing, plus Cultural
Studies)m to FR, to Jacket, to all the various poetry publications on the
WWW ... Ken's right, there isn't anything to prove, in the 70s sense,
there's only myriad kinds of writing and continually expanding possibilities
for production. This isn't meant to sound Utopian. It's true, in the midst
of all this plenitude, I pick up "April Galleons" or "The Cold of Poetry"
more often than the latest issue of ... whatever ... but that's okay. I
haven't got any standards. Any my values are stricly my own:
 >
 >"It seems I was reading something;
 >I have forgotten the sense of it or what the small
 >role of the central poem made me want to feel."
 >
 >
 >Martin Bell
 >
In the apolitics of PoMo, the cultural arena has largely become just a
competitive marketplace - especially in thefunding game. The reason Ken
Bolton's "war of aesthetics" is unimaginable at the moment for the little
magazines, is that the main thing many are "trying to prove" is their
viability in the eyes of the funding bodies. Only a very few magazines can
afford to sustain a tight political focus - eg, Quadrant, Arena, Eureka
Street - and to an extent it's because they cater to institutionalized
readerships.
Certainly i solicit the majority of work for Siglo; always along a theme,
and always inevitably political. But the expedient motivation must firstly
be Range and Quality (of which there is only so much to go round) -
political aesthetics is then a bonus.
Is this a bad thing? Well, it's always a good thing to subvert cultural and
political etlites, to engage and debate. But organizing such forums is a
time consuming process for editorial stafff, and when time must be costed,
it's often a case of going with what and who you have. Polemics doesn't sell
as well as broad market appeal - at least that's what we fear. just ask
Robert Manne...

These Australian editors are so well spoken it is hard to follow. Reasons I
started and continued Outlet and Double Lucy include the following--

*Wanting to continue the female tradition of writing and publishing

* wanting to give a place for women's writing , but of course those whose
aesthetics we can respect and relate to

*BUT not ignoring men either as nothing is stable yknow.

*Wanting to investigate themes the other eds and I found interesting, of
course not just themic but having to do with our own aesthetic tastes in the
editing...these vary as one ed is a scholar, one a fiction writer, and two
of us more along the lines of poets, plus just our reading habits and
thrills.

* Our framework became perhaps most clear to me (& I am hardly one to adore
clear frameworks) in editing and writing editorialish things for the
Heroines issue. I wanted to let in a lot of different reading voices to talk
about literature and literary history. I can clearly state that this is
because I think literature is not the province or under the true stewardship
of an intellectual elite and because doctrinaire things which come from
manifestos feminist or Vorticist disturb me. Mix it up man.

I guess that's all for now. My husband said recently (when I asked) that he
always thought Outlet the title had a bit too much of the "emotional outlet"
flair to it, while all along I was thinking of it like an inlet/outlet
geographically.


Please, other eds and folks, reply.


Cheers to one and all,

Elizabeth

Elizabeth. I'm a bit obsesed with this topic....for the moment...but I think
is important hence what might appear to be my "bullying" approach but I just
feel strongly. I know it cant help Sylvia now.Of course we need also to all
look again at her poems which are mostly excellent ..."great" was a
problematic term I chose for want of a term at the time... Also I began with
a discussion of the Cofessionals etc. I made the point to someone else that
when I came across Plath's "Aerial" I'd never heard of Plath. I thought from
the text that she may have committed suicide. I wrote a poem at the time
"about" how I became obsessed trying to find that she had committed suicide.
Part of me feels and understands: the other part wants to rail against her
ragingly. Regards, Richard.

Poetics Group. Criticism of someone or something wont go away because you
label it "sexit" ar "racist"..the question is is it true or relevant. I
would have the same citicism of a man.People have to face their
resposibilitties to temselves and others. This is a weak escape route to
label discussion "sexist".
 But my previous comments remain. I think the issue IS important. Richard
Taylor.

And you Elizabeth. You are a good writer? I know its hard to say that: not
from immodesty per se: but how do we sound or read to others? And its hard
to evaluate oneself. I've stopped worrying: even almost lost interest. I
think that I wil leave some work for a few friends but "fame" and all that
are meaningless to me. I just want to live. I write poems but find it hard
to motivate to publish them or even put them onto the computer. I admire
Alan Sondhein his ability and energy.Or that he even cares about things. I'm
not sure if I do: maybe I'm tired....Maybe this IS a kind of poem...
Increasingly I see things I have written and only rarely do I care about
them. I'm not even sure of why I'm on the List. I have stopped reading
poetry mags and subscribing to anything and am reading a bio of Swinburne
and relevant poems etc and enjoying that.....but I can never imagine being
(now days) interested very much whether people or critics or anyone reads or
likes what I have written. I'm just as pround or indifferent to some
paintings I did when I was about 10. I have thm on the wall. I like them.
Pictures (watercolour) full of light and greens and blues and mountains and
colour. They are there, in my room, by the bed. Most people who enter the
room never say anything about them. Very few people enter that room. No
women do: or very very few. They are there though. They are there. They are
there and maybe this apathy will pass or I'll give up my poetry hobby and do
something else. Richard.

MIME-Version: 1.0

0


of the book


i cannot write the book i desire; i think constantly - this text is an
introduction. there is nothing beyond the introduction.

the introduction is fecund, replete, with the details of the world
between heat birth and cold death; the introduction inhales universal
annihilation. there is no proper way to express this.

the books i would write break down upon their enunciation.

the announcement of the book is the book; the announcement effaces
itself in the exhaustion of continuous production. i hold
therapeutically, psychoanalytically, to this production; it becomes a
life-form, prehensile; it reaches towards the book; its tentacles begin
to wrap themselves around each and every trope; metaphors becomes
obstacles and worlds; the production exhales in its own denouement.

only in fear do i look forward to this production which spells my
failure,this inability to continue, this waywardness, contrariness.

it reaches through me, comes through me; how could i not believe in
ghosts, avatars, cyborgs, prostheses, emananations? i write as if their
very existence depended on it. repeatedly: i write myself into
existence; i write myself out of it. but the existence is tinged with
labor throughout - it is the laboring of an existence fragile and
wavering literally beyond belief.

if i could only make a statement and hold to it; if i could only connect
a series of statements, almost as if they were axioms "as if to say." it
is my strength and weakness that such connections are governed by
laughter, and the statements themselves, by misery. i am one of the few
who constantly see through myself. i know about failure from within, the
rapidity of existence, the inability to seize time for an instant. the
darkness is overwhelming: it is the darkness of the first and last, and
only in the midst of chaotic neutrality is the semblance of being
manifest.

holding to the book: holding memory in place throughout the vicissitudes
of life. a continuous series of failed projects tends asymptotically
towards truths that otherwise remain submerged; as it is, they are
external to symbolic foreclosure, forms of meanderings more at one with
dark matter than luminous and momentary gravity.

i could never tell you where the statement might be; what might be the
equivalence of the book; what might be its destination or distribution;
who might read what could be interpreted as a tropology of illness. i
could never tell you the statement, or "make it" in any sense, nor is
there a concept which holds fast, the "one good idea" that each of us is
supposedly destined to express. it is the "nor" that grips me, the
"neither this nor that," the "not both this and that," the dissuasions
of propositional logics and their fundamental modes - the
superimpositions of gestural logics and their organic gestures towards
the frisson and trembling of being in relation.

if only i could write of the rush of letters, the stream of meanings,
shape-riding semantics in the depths of the night! if only utterance
were at home within me, if there were set themes ready to be expressed,
clouds and darkened flows "just" about to turn or return to the
symbolic. instead the dance is always around - and it is a dance - a
fire elsewhere,beings i could almost see in the dim light, theoretical
constructs about to emerge out of a communality i witness, but never
partake in. even the play of the world escapes me; i search for books
within it; i search for the finality of the word, deconstructing at a
rush, fevered with disbelief, exhausted with being. what is "out there"
is never a "what," never "out there"; what is out there is insufficient.

biography, autobiography, flattens and disenchant, transforming theory
and abstraction to the incidental. scaffolding becomes anecdote and
complexity is reduced to the despair of a sleepless night. the book that
calls me forth is otherwise, effacing in the midst of the call, denying
in its insistency.

it asserts the "it" "itself," creating presence in absence, ontology in
the midst of chaos. it is the engine or process born of desire; it has
no otherwise existence. i fight constantly to ensure that its contents
and index reflect something beyond that, that desire does not become
circumstance, that circumstance does not turn thought of the world into
diary. no life is "worth living" and not in the book which calls me.

the book is an addiction.

the book is an inescapable addiction, raging, regulated, in the absence
of drugs, called forth in clarity, self-inscribing. not worth living,
but a medium of the world, circumstantial mediation or re/mediation in
denial.

this denial, rhetoric, flight, are characteristic of that philosophy of
dedication inhabiting me like an illness; they are symptoms of the book;
they fumble within me; they lock themselves within me; they hold my mind
in its insufficiency. they are my promise of redemption.

i deconstruct the possessive, calling on methodologies i recognize as
already used, carrying their own stain, their own historic shame.
thinking must always cast aside the stigma; thinking must never replace
it with the taint of purity. this is what i have been promised, speaking
to others through myself: these are the words of the book.

never written, this too a cauterization of a wound refusing to heal.

i cannot write the book "i desire" - that is my failure, not that of the
book. even the sentence is a sentencing; what is left to say falls to
pieces. indeed, there is nothing beyond the introductions.

like any other illness, a compulsion to write, to rectify, to bring down
the house, to absolve rectification, to slant.

to comprehend illness as a symptom, the momentary apparition of being.

"i desire," "my desire." the writing of submergence. the writing of the
remnant, remains. the writing of being-submerged, submerged writing.

the book, my book, the book.

Hi Everyone,

A very old friend of mine, Jerry J. Davis, who is kind of a Philip K.
Dick-style sci-fi writer, whose novels are hilarious, paranoid & brutally
satirical, needs our help! A book I remember him writing when we both lived
in Stockton, California, was picked up by a publishing house ... but for
e-publication only. The publisher now has pitched Jerry's book against two
other novels ... and is asking people to vote for their favorite. Clearly,
this is a popularity contest, which Jerry -- who is not without friends, but
is hardly a social butterfly -- is destined to lose. (He's currently running
third of three.)

That is, without our help.

Please help Jerry win! Go to this site:

http://newauthors.ipublish.com/index.asp

and read his & the other two excerpts ... and vote for your favorite. I'm
not asking you to cheat. Oh, god no. No. I'm just "certain" that you'll like
Jerry's book best!

Hurry! Thanks!

Gary

David,
What do you like to do, and what kind of hotel would be acceptable to your
tastes anbd standards of cleanliness?  A two-star hotel in Istanbul is a lot
different than a two-star hotel in Paterson, New Jersey; a lot cheaper, but
a lot dirtier.  In response to what you might do, why not visit the many
on-going open-air bazaars in town - the best "view" of the city there is,
internal as well as external.  And keep in mind that as you get further from
those bazaars most frequented by your more standard trembling Western
visitor, the more interesting and perhaps unusual will be those "objets
d'art" offered you "for your pleasure, mister."
Have a good trip.
Best wishes,
Selim Abdul Sadiq

other performing/visual arts.
   I would really like you to see this poetry grotto,
thus *lustrum poetae*, this basement where, seemingly,
anything can happen.
   I hope to conduct the poetry events in a salonish
format, so that questions may be asked, dialogues may be
engaged, please help make it interesting by your presence.
   Plus, this bar is truly good drinking for poets/writers
of all kinds. Spread the word if you like.

        thanks,    Matvei (of Ugly Duckling Presse/6x6)

ABOUT THIS MONTHS POETS & PERFORMERS...

&------&
MARK McMANUS has recently moved back to New York, from
where? He's had some poems published in McSweeneys.net
(new!),  Arshile and an experimental music magazine named
Music. Also works as a musician: had a very obscure
recording under a stage name Mark Never, and just finished
another one named The Donkey Silent.

&------&
AARON BELZ is a writer and teacher in St. Louis, MO. He's a
graduate of the NYU workshop (1995).
He has published poetry in Gulf Coast, Mudfish, Exquisite
Corpse, Jacket, -VeRT, RealPoetik,
canwehaveourballback.com,
elimae, etc, & forthcoming in Fence, Fine Madness, and
Pierogi Press. Maybe soon some lucky publisher will choose
Belz's manuscript, _Nineteen Harps_, out of the pile.

&------&
EUGENE OSTASHEVSKY just moved back to New York from San
Francisco via Ankara, Turkey. While in San Francisco, he
co-founded (with Brandon Downing) the writers’ collective
9X9 Industries. He also organized large-scale
interdisciplinary art events as member of the performance
trio Vainglorious.
  His poems have appeared in 6,500, Combo, Lungfull!,
Oxygen, Log, 6x6 and other magazines, as well as in a
series of chapbooks published by Eugene Timerman. His
translations from Russian are published widely because they
are awesome.

&------&
BRANDON DOWNING is recent. In San Francisco he was the
co-founder of <famous> Blue Boooks, and curated the
<famous> Books Readings #1 Series for 2 <famous> years.
Founding editor and serious spirit of the <famous> magazine

 He used to live there but now he lives here. Good for us.

&------&
SIMONE WHITE will sing her own songs to her own
accompaniment. Simone does this with a voice
unquantifiable, a modest demeanor, and the lyrics of a
thinking poet. Take my word for it, you'll thank your fates
for having heard her. She will also show her excellent LOMO
slides.
Recently repatriated from London, Simone is acting in the
title role of BILLY THE KID at The Flea Theater.

Often as not tariffs in developing countries are used by narrow,
privileged elites to prevent their compatriots from exercising free choice
and purchase a better product from elsewhere.  In effect, through tariffs
the rich tax the poor.  Worse, the real issue here concersn tariffs in
rich countries that deny me the right to choose to support poor world
farmers by purchasing their products.  Developing countries have been
screaming for 'trade, not aid' for as long as I have been politically
aware.

 with layoffs and pay cuts for workers in the privatized enterprises.

As with trade tariffs, inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
represent a tax on the poor, who are forced to purchase their inferior
goods at a higher price, while also often supporting these organizations
with tax dollars that should be going to the poor.  Jobs in SOEs are also
often resevered as spoils in clientelistic networks.  So again, those
being layed off are often a privileged, parasitical elite.

> * Cuts in government spending -- Reductions in government spending

the

industrial
 layoffs.

Government in many developing countries has provided no services to the
poor as it is.  In the 1991 census (I think it was) in Brazil, 44% of male
heads of household in the state of Sergipe had zero years of formal
education.  Zero.  This is male household heads in a patriarchical
society, so the figures for women would be even worse.  At the same time,
university students regularly go on strike if their bolsas (scholarships)
are threatened.  Brazil's university system is merit-based, the brightest
get in, which is another way of saying that white middle class kids
dominate.  How likely do you think it is that the child of an illiterate
sertanejo would beat the privileged middle class kid in a free competition
for these places?  So if government spending is cut, who do you think is
hurt?  The poor?  They weren't getting anything in the first place, indeed
whatever taxes they pay go to support the free university education of the
rich, these often the children of employees of SOEs themselves coddled
with the tax dollars of the poor.

 the denial of access to services.

This can happen, yet again, often as not the poor aren't getting a hell of
a lot out of government, anyway.  So these user fees hit the rich and
middle classes as much, if not more than, the poor.

> But the corporate globalizers are nothing if not ambitious. They are

This is nave in the extreme.  The myth of US hegemony in international
fora should be clear to anyone with an open mind, given the way that the
current US administration has walked out of so many of these in the past
few months.  Far from a superpower hegemon, the US is virtually an
international pariah.

> intensify the IMF and World Bank's ability to impose structural

Structural adjustment has never been imposed on another country.  These
have always been able to refuse the loans that are the carrot for the
structural adjustment agreements.

> To lessen preventable human suffering, it is imperative that the

 with everything from street protests to citizen lobbying of Congress.

To lessen preventable human suffering, it is imperative that the global
community continue to remain vigilant against the arrogant classist,
racist movement of white middle class rich world activists who seek to
deny non-white poor countries the right to assemble in international fora
and indicate their own preferences in international policy arenas.

Cheers,

George

George Bowering Writes:

<Well, greatness is nearly impossible without the person's being dead.
I mean greatness comes when you are still considered vastly important
after all the fads are over. Unless you are Peter the Great or somone.
I mean greatness while being alive is mainly a matter of op[inion in
individuals ior groups of individuals. I mean do we know whether
people in the year 2666 will recognize the name Pollock or Ashbery?>

I reply:

Still though, I'd say that "greatness", even after a person's been long
dead is still very much a matter of opinion. And the opinions are
grounded very much in the present of the ones with the winning
opinion. (And that's only my opinion, btw.)

Scottish poet [Edinburgh], maybe just the wrong side of fifty but not by
much.  Never quite made it, but writes like an angel.  No rep in The Nation

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

This responds to the conversation
about editing:

I cannot name a publication that is
slapped together thoughtlessly and
haphazardly.  Like them, like their
choices or not, someone is making the
calls, putting this poet next to that,
etc.

A good friend of mine recently told
me I wasn't a real editor.  This hurt
me quite a bit, but to a certain degree
I agree.  I cast a large field, I send
no rejections.  In the same issue you'll
find poems by Amiri Baraka and Rod McKuen,
for example.  Bernstein and Bukowski in
another.  In the first issue, Pinsky and
Stroffolino.  This is not done thoughtlessly
or haphazardly.

THE NEW YORKER, POETRY, THE ATLANTIC
MONTHLY: these magazines all have
aesthetics, narrow editorial policies.
Should they be emulated by young
editors?

I guess I could start something--"The
Cool School"--and a magazine--COOL--
and include every poet I slept with
and who wrote, thought and dressed
like me (it would be a really tiny
magazine). That would have a strong
aesthetic and a firm editorial hand.
But why should a reader care about
COOL? Because it makes an editorial
statement?

What I react strongest to is Mr. Bolton's
statements, and Mr. Silliman's.  We young
editors don't "get it."  We don't know
what the hell we're doing.  We're lazy and
we don't know good work.

Well, that's the tone.  I say we are
fortunately bejeweled with enough smart,
fantastic magazines to satisfy any poetic
taste, and to reflect the exciting
work being produced as we all, for
whatever reason, are instead reading
(or writing) this.

The definition of an editor is, simply,
someone who is in charge of a magazine.
I tip my hat to the whole breed--it is
thankless, frustrating, exhilerating
and rewarding work.

So somebody comes to my magazine.  They
scratch their heads, "What the hell is this
poet doing here?"  Maybe they click on, maybe
they encounter the work, maybe they love or
hate it, say to themselves, "This guy's not
so bad," or "Wow, she sucks."  Or they skip
by, they click on a friend, or a poet they've
heard of but haven't read.

I've given the reader choices.  I've done my job,
I'm a real editor. Call it a "gathering."  Call it
"eclecticism."  Bishop wrote, "Somebody loves us all."
I have once again earned my zero dollar paycheck.

George. I take your point: nihilism has its advocates and anti-advocates. In
my  more lucid moments I'd come down on the side of life. And one could
build a University Course around who owns whose life. In certain situations
a suicide is possibly a dignified exit. But as you say some philosophies
hold all life sacrosanct which is not a bad philosophy: but I'm still gunna
squash a bug if it's a pest. But I think the implication of Cassie's
letter - maybe not what she said - was "lets lighten up" (if we can on such
a subject): the point now would be to look at how to prevent or lessen the
numbers of suicides in the future and I suppose where in for a long haul as
the Israelis and the Palestinians are hammer and tongs slaughtering each
other: and more than something is rotten in the state. Many great "advances"
but the basic situation seems no better overall. Maybe, slowly, we'll get
there.
  I think that we are social animals and that in most cases we are, though
ultimately self responsible, we have strong links to others and those links
are essential to our survival. So, in general, nihilism leads nowhere. So
our best approach as writers would be to encorage self-responsibility and
put out as many positive messages about life: which is overall marvellous,
given the darknesses, and, if possible "tough out" or overcomne any negative
thinking. Richard.

because it is inert, because it refuses writing;
because it constitutes a sheen difficult or impossible to inscribe;
because it draws forth the desire of memory to hold fast;
because it is drawn forth of memory held fast;

precisely because of its weight and vacuity, it remains impossible in its
relation to organism, and it is this impossibility that seduces.

whatever is uttered is already in relation to density and absence; the
stranger is ignored in the city; archaic graphemes remain indecipherable

i heard a reading of 'daddy' on an lp of poetry and knew that poem
was great when i heard it. i still have a copy of it and play it
occassionally, it created a poetic moment for me the first time i
heard it and continues to do so.
the poem was powerful and not autobiographical for me - i didn't know
anything about plath at the time.
the poem, for me, spoke of patriarchy(in its extreme form - fascism)
not specifically _her_ father or _her_ husband or _her_ teachers
i later found out about sylvia plath and her history and mystery
which was of interest but added nothing to the poem.

in my canon, and we all have one, this poem is high in the list.

hope this is helpful

ps. all the rest is politics, hype and conjecture and part of a
continuing dialogue which constructs the greatness of the author.

Bill. I agree re going to Doctors etc. This one is a hard one, and
interesting: I dont want to be ghoulish. Unfortuantely New Zealand has the
highest per capita suicude youth (and maybe generally) rate in the world (as
far as recording methods etc are accurate given that some countries distort
by ommission or commission these figures). Apparently that figure is
dropping. I actually came into this on the whole question of the
personality/mask/subjective/objective angle and somehow I "crossed" it with
the discussion of Hannah Einer). I'm a bit dulled by the fact that Barret
Watten weighs in with portentious "profects" for us or "discussion points"
then doesnt even reply to my post on Hannah Weiner where I actually took the
trouble to have a look at her poetry and put it on the net. No one commented
which makes me wonder if Patrick isnt right: people like to be either
"attacking" or slinging off, but are frightened to say what they really
think (this applies to everyone I suppose so i'm not angry or anything) so I
suppose that's how things are (after all I dont get to see all my own
email).....but that drips at tap ends was from the old joke:"What's an
expert" the answer is something like:"X is the unknown factor, and the spurt
is what comes out of a tap"  That sort of thing. So I turned it to "drips at
tap ends"!
  Hope all's well with you Bill. My family are doing well despite me. My
daughters are in Australia: which by the way is NOT joined to New Zealand -
yet! My son is ok all things considered and I'm still short fat balding &
poor but quite happy.As I'm relatively penurious women stay away from me in
droves: my little joke. Probably also because I'm a grumpy little bastard as
well!  Busy collating rare and second hand books: some valuable, many not. I
sell them on eBay or through ABE.com who by the way are very good (via eg
ADD ALL) for tracing books. That is time consuming but I'm also addicted to
Chess and play on ICC (Internet Chess Club) where I "take no prisoners" !!
Cheers, Richard.

Maybe.  I wonder, though, if after enough time has passed, opinion still
matters.  Doesn't it become a matter of general acceptance at some point?
Shakespeare's international reputation, for example, seems set in stone.  It
might be the case that once opinion has carried an author far enough, s/he
eventually transcends opinion and becomes a necessary cog in the culture, an
intrinsic part of a culture's definition.   When that happens, it's probably
fair to call an author great.  No?  Best, Bill

To be fair to Ron Silliman, I supect that behind his statement lies a keen
understanding of the marketplace.  There is so much poetry out there of all
kinds, that in order to rise to the surface one must be consistent and
perhaps controversial.  A mag that gathers may simply be recording the
zeitgeist.  One with a strong editorial point of view--even better, a point
of view that offends or befuddles lots of people--has a better shot of
"gathering" attention (e.g., L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E).  A convincing argument can be
made, I think, that these days strategy is far more important than good art.
Anyway, if a particular formulation focuses attention, a general view that
the art is good, or important, or significant, or something along those
lines, will inevitably follow.  Of course, however a mag wants to operate
depends on the ambitions of its editors--to present what they consider
quality art (whatever form it takes), or to crack the marketplace.  Best,
Bill

I've been having trouble donating to this discussion -- I think my email's
on the fritz or something.  I'd like to share a few thoughts as per
Elizabeth Treadwell's open suggestion that editors on the list simply speak
up.

First)  The thread began with someone asking about "language writing" and
citing "Buffalo student magazines" as familiar proponents of such things.  I
made a failed attempt to go on the record at that time as noticing how
disingenuous the notion of "language writing" is itself, something I set out
to demonstrate early on in editing and publishing Kenning.  Secondly, as for
Kenning, I brought the project to Buffalo and consider it and many other
similar projects in Buffalo by or seemingly by students in "the program"
diverse and particular enough to earn something more than the arbitrary
appellation, "Buffalo student magazine."  Never mind the conveniences of the
EPC and / or literary historians.  Who else could claim "writing" to be
"asyntactical"?!

Second)  "Just gathering" is, in many contexts, an argument for something
other than liberal plurality.  This was part of what I hoped to demonstrate
with Kenning and the early editor's notes bear this out in their own
tortured ways.  Obviously, in my own context, the recontextualization of
so-called "language writing" became one key component of this.  But, in
calling Kenning a "newsletter" -- and by other turns -- I explicitly gather
work into a context which imagines public(ation) space ripe for "progressive
social discourse".  Demos or no-doze, there you have it.  Williams may not
get the news from poems, but men die anyway, as some Rod Smith once said.

Third)  Kenning was chosen as a title so as to establish a goal that could
be sought after in a variety of ways, hence the variety of TYPES of
publications under that rubric.  To make good on "kenning" in the double
sense of fusion and difference.  In other words, by "gathering" new writing
AS progressive social discourse, the fusion accentuates the differences
which return to (I'd hope) the poetic imagination.  Hence I've always hoped
that Kenning would appeal to writers first and last, though the amount of
unsolicited submissions (always welcomed) from folks who admittedly have
never purchased or read an issue (never welcomed) suggests that hope is more
often than not destined to be dashed.

Fourth)  I'd even suggest there is an ethics to "gathering" that would mean
we can save the phrase "just gathering," and I'd love to hear from The Germ
people about this.  Anyhow, looking at Kenning's first 6 issues [which it
would, in too many ways, be irrelevant to reprint] would clear these points
up as much as complicate their precepts.  As someone once said, "Sorting
just happens, don't dignify it" -- "bouncing an idea out into the open
through publishing" will always happen, only more or less explicitly.

Now to add my two cents:

Personally, the magazines that mean the most to me are the ones that are
ecclectic enough to surprise me, open enough to include both younger &
(neglected) older writers, & focused enough that the magazine, if not
necessarily all work in it, seems to represent a kind of "aesthetic" or
viewpoint.  Probably the print magazines that most consistently satisfy me
on these grounds right now are The Germ, Combo & Kenning, though I'm
probably forgetting a few others.  (By the way, kudos to Andrew & Macgregor
for the amazing & gorgeous French poetry issue, which I am still making my
way through!)

I think that the best way to understand Ron Silliman's post (though I'm not
sure that he himself would rephrase it like this) is that those magazines
with a highly visible & provocative point of view stand a better chance of
making it into literary history than those magazines which "only" publish
excellent or challenging work.  I'm sure he is right about this.  However, I
would point out that it is the latter which (often) are more influential.
As proof of that, I have only to point out, as Ron did, that no one has
attempted to take up where Apex of the M left off.  Now, Apex of the M was a
wonderful magazine; and if I single it out, it is only because there have
not been any *other* magazines in the last 15 years (at least) to have
combined such a concentration of good poetry with a polemically-charged
editorial stance.  However-- & despite its high profile-- NO ONE has
attempted to carry on with that sort of project since that magazine folded.
Maybe someone will: these things tend to go in cycles.  But for now, this is
where it stands.  By comparison-- & to single out another magazine from
roughly the same period-- I think o•blek has been relatively influential.  I
can think of a few magazines which strike me as having been partially
modeled on o•blek's content & format-- though I wish to let those editors
speak for themselves, if they want to, rather than indulge in what may be
speculation.  Also, o•blek's final, "New Coast" issue, I think, has had a
lot more impact on U.S. poetry in the last several years than Apex of the M
did.  I'd also like to point out that, though roughly half of that issue was
devoted to poetic "statements" or theory, the overall tone was not
polemical, but rather, it had the ecclectic feel of "a gathering."

So much for editorial viewpoint.

Jim, you're obviously walking that difficult line of trying to keep your
publication "open" but open to a purpose, as you say, not haphazardly so.
It's generous of you to give props to editors everywhere but I can also
see where Ron S. is coming from in his implicit call to current
editors to at least consider the motivations/implications
(aesthetic, political, social, whathaveyou) of their projects.  This seems
to me the ethical thing to do.  I can think of many reasons why you'd want
Baraka and McKuen in the same mag and I'm sure you could think of many
more.  To me, the twin bugbears of journal editing are selection based on
fame and selection based on connection (of whatever kind) to the editor.
On the one hand, this leads some editors to create very narrow and
exclusive publications.  On the other hand, some editors, fearing those
bugbears to one extent or another, decide to "accept simply the best
writing available."  HA!  There's no such thing, a huge problem.  And so
one ends with a sort of false "taste"-driven ecclecticism or, fuck it, you
take your friends and famous poets anyway and try to explain it as "the
best" or shield it by taking a few "unknowns."  POETRY may indeed be a
narrow-minded publication which selects from a narrow field of writers but
I'd venture to say that the writers therein have less of a connection to
EACH OTHER than most of the mags I like.  So, there's different types of
narrowness -- some more problematic than others, at least to me.

Which brings me to a question: can a mag be narrow in terms of
representing a specific community of writers, and even having a fairly
specific editorial intent, and still be "open."  I don't think, looking
back at it, that there's anything narrow about YUGEN even tho the
community it represented was fairly small, as was it's readership
(compared with, say, PARIS REVIEW).  But there's such a feeling of risk
there, and the address of the work is so often entirely PUBLIC (in the
sense of poets leaving their work OPEN to the unidentified reader) that it
rarely feels exclusive to me.  As someone in this thread said, that's a
different era, sure.  But it seems to me that much of that vibe is worth
emulating, and in putting togetehr COMBO I had in the back of my mind that
it should be at least a little like YUGEN for a community of poets not in
NYC but rather held together by the precarious thread which is e-mail.

I have a pretty solid take on what I'm up to with each issue.  I write
editors notes, do interviews.  I am NOT trying to take the "best work."
How would I know it if I found it?  I DO  want work which is ambitious,
not trying to do the same old same old of any camp, court or coterie.  But
I would distinguish the coterie from the evolving community which has
earned the right to be identified as such AND continues to evolve.
Likewise, I try like help to read all the work sent to me assiduously, so
as not to miss the next thing which blows me away.  The list of poets who
I published in COMBO w/out having ever seen their work elsewhere is
numerous - but, importantly, I took the work not becuase it was "the best"
in some universal sense but because it *belonged in the community* -
indeed was crucial in many cases, to it's development.  K. Silem Mohammad,
Mark Sardinha, Carl Martin, and (very early on and frequently
thereafter) Jessica Chiu, come to mind here.

I tried to outline some of my thoughts on this subject in my note to COMBO
8 - vis a vis Steve Evans' critique of FENCE and THE GERM.  But it's nice
to have another occassion to think things through...

-m.

        Hi Jim,

        I too follow your ideals on editing. You are a real editor and tell your
friend who said you are not to suck a lemon. I love this idea and feel
suspect over journals who place too much of THEM over what writers submit. I
am on your side if you need it.


        best, Geoffrey

Subject: edit, editors, editing

This responds to the conversation
about editing:

I cannot name a publication that is
slapped together thoughtlessly and
haphazardly.  Like them, like their
choices or not, someone is making the
calls, putting this poet next to that,
etc.

A good friend of mine recently told
me I wasn't a real editor.  This hurt
me quite a bit, but to a certain degree
I agree.  I cast a large field, I send
no rejections.  In the same issue you'll
find poems by Amiri Baraka and Rod McKuen,
for example.  Bernstein and Bukowski in
another.  In the first issue, Pinsky and
Stroffolino.  This is not done thoughtlessly
or haphazardly.

THE NEW YORKER, POETRY, THE ATLANTIC
MONTHLY: these magazines all have
aesthetics, narrow editorial policies.
Should they be emulated by young
editors?

I guess I could start something--"The
Cool School"--and a magazine--COOL--
and include every poet I slept with
and who wrote, thought and dressed
like me (it would be a really tiny
magazine). That would have a strong
aesthetic and a firm editorial hand.
But why should a reader care about
COOL? Because it makes an editorial
statement?

What I react strongest to is Mr. Bolton's
statements, and Mr. Silliman's.  We young
editors don't "get it."  We don't know
what the hell we're doing.  We're lazy and
we don't know good work.

Well, that's the tone.  I say we are
fortunately bejeweled with enough smart,
fantastic magazines to satisfy any poetic
taste, and to reflect the exciting
work being produced as we all, for
whatever reason, are instead reading
(or writing) this.

The definition of an editor is, simply,
someone who is in charge of a magazine.
I tip my hat to the whole breed--it is
thankless, frustrating, exhilerating
and rewarding work.

So somebody comes to my magazine.  They
scratch their heads, "What the hell is this
poet doing here?"  Maybe they click on, maybe
they encounter the work, maybe they love or
hate it, say to themselves, "This guy's not
so bad," or "Wow, she sucks."  Or they skip
by, they click on a friend, or a poet they've
heard of but haven't read.

I've given the reader choices.  I've done my job,
I'm a real editor. Call it a "gathering."  Call it
"eclecticism."  Bishop wrote, "Somebody loves us all."
I have once again earned my zero dollar paycheck.

That is kind of true. But there must be some other criterion.
Otherwise, whatsernam Aguilara would be a great singer.

Komminos and Poeticas. True. And apoem of course  has a "higher meaning"
over and above it's ostensible meaning.(You probably know this or the
general "drift" of what I'm poking at).  The connections or connotations (eg
to "patriarchialism in your case - which unless someone draws my attention
to it - is irrelevant to me: or to whether a poem is "about" whatever is
often irrelevant: its the way the poem is structure and adds to the
poem..but in all cases a poem needs the energy and magic of language: the
mystery that reflects the fundamental human mystery of consciouness and
creativity...again which is not to say that a writer has no structure of or
overarching formulation or drive or obsession: on fact I think in Plath's
case the torment (however it came about) helped to energise her creative
thinking....as in my own case I was writing a poem a week when in a state of
great grief and emotional turmoil due to a separation, and I havent said
this before but that WAS why I was writing for love or loss or insecurity or
the fear of death and obliteration oblivion which I think are those
irrational rationalities that "motivatee" us in conjunction with say the
sight of a sunset, or some object, or the listening to music, or reading
something, or overhearing a conversation, being intrigued by a piece of
graffitti, a "forieign" or unusual movie, music, whatever: these things
inter-energise: its not enough for me for a poet to play ALL THE TIME...I
put that in shout because I dont want to reject play: in fact play is a
marvellous energiser, and its maybe a pity that not more joy (as well as
darkness etc) was in Plath's or Berryman's or whatever poet's life to well
the dark-light energisation: I feel that Alan Sondheim comes close....he
almost writes "too much" but ...who knows...there's some fascinating stuff
he pours out of himself: like the man's on fire...)
  Your experience of "meeting" Plath was similar to mine. Then I went on an
Ashbery jag: my best wishes to that marvellous poet through the List by the
way. Richard.

I am less than you, Joe. Stench-ridden, puss-pimpled, fat with drink. Unbelievably long turds snake out my butt (though I should never confess it-- how shameful the look and smell of it). Sometimes after I scratch my oily hole in the "DARK OF NIGHT," I smell my finger and then go back to REM'ed sleep like a child. I marvel at the napalmish odor of my morning breath, cupped in my hand. No one invites me to dinner anymore.
*
(Two weeks ago I screamed at my twelve year old on a canoe trip down the Wisconsin River because he tried to pry open a clam he'd found in the shallows, and I screamed you little fucking jerk, I screamed, you little piece of shit, it's an endangered fresh water clam, what is wrong with you, huh, you little fuck, it's on the endangered species list...

Oh Dad, oh Dad, he wept, sitting on the beached canoe, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, he said (certain that he'd ruined everything, on this birthday present trip for him). I'm sorry, I, I, I thought that clams only lived in the ocean [his curled-in-ball and rocking form])
*
It bothers me that the human body smells so revoltingly after death, and I grow ridiculously melancholic watching the sewer waters of the Choqueyapu rush by, in this god-forsakenly beautiful city of La Paz. To what should we liken, Joe, the American poetic avant-garde? To a long, snaking turd? To an endangered clam? To a lovely boy, washed for heaven, entering a market in Jerusalem? What is the relationship of our poetic avant-garde's "that's too much personal information" [illegible passage] to a clump of Semtex strapped in a dark boy's crotch?
*
In a photograph in Jacket, my head is at a coquettish tilt. A stick for writing is lightly pressed against my lips. The whole under-boulder world of chrysalises and slugs has broken loose (digitzed whirs). I am wild with it, Joe, wild with the romanticism under the fiber-glass rock, the kind that hide the little satellite dish, locked into its authorial beam.

This is what I meant, I think, about prosody needing to be taught with a vengeance, no wires attached. This is what I meant when I said, "Don't condemn my name. I love you."

Patrick--

Taking you'all seriously--

Living writers who are great
& may all their ears burn in this public proclamation

Over 70--
Jack Gilbert
Gerritt Lansing

In their thirties--
Julie Otten
Terrance Hayes
Rachel Loden

I would add Terri Ford & Christy Sheffield-Sanford also, though I am
unsure offhand if they are over or under your 50 mark. I also would
include Jimmy Santiago-Baca  --except two new books of his arrived
today-- which might change my opinion.

I believe in the Marianne Moore model for greatness. All of the above
living writers have this in common: few collections out, in each
collection every poem is great. Obviously this condition of greatness
may change for the thirty somethings as more collections are released
but at least Hayes will fit the commoner notion of greatness as he won a
bunch of awards including the Whitting, & his 2nd book is forthcoming
from the National Poetry Series.

Considering the above criteria, Ashbery is not great. A poet with great
books, yes; but he released a bunch that slighted his audience and his
poetic genius after signing a multi-book contract and rushing the
completion of his poems through an adroit publication process. I am the
reader who feels cheated.

Gilbert, on the other hand, has only released three collections so far.
Views of Jeopardy won the Yale Younger in the early 60's, back when the
contest openly sought talent, and the collection included poems composed
over a decade earlier from his & Duncan & Spicer's roundtable days. The
second reprinted some of these poems and added a new section, the third:
all new work.

I offer that a great poet controls the poems they send into the ethos,
and while they may have individual early poems or even later ones that
appear in journals, in regards to a full length collection only the
great poems are published.


Be well

Ron--

I'm not sure what you are reading
but I have seen many issues of magazines
with recent poetic statements
of impact

None are located on the East or West Coast tho
perhaps that is why--

Here is ours from issue #5
there is another in #6

------------------------
Editor’s note:

Howdy, to those just joining in fray or those who knew the fabric before
tailored. If not, Pavement Saw runs width, across things continuing.
Here, at the magic fifth issue mark, where most journals and magazines
fold, I’d like to briefly say something for once to define why I do what
I do, to clarify.

As an editor, I've never pushed for large sales based names. The
opportunity has arose to publish central figures in 2nd generation NY
school, Language poetry, Beat, & other movements, but to publish dribble
based on sales or gaining “cultural capital” is a horseshit notion based
on short term gain and lack of marketing abilities. We have published
brand new names with a primary focus on bookless or only one book
authors. Our first books and chapbooks have allowed the movement of
authors to a selling point, without using the name as a brand
identification. Expect the same. Being in it for the long haul means we
allow those published here to move forward at their pace, capitalized
on, if and when, later.

All of our full length book authors, except for the yearly contest
title, have appeared in the magazine first or were brought to our
attention by authors who first appeared in these pages. This journal is
your best bet towards a full length collection. We are biased towards
first collections and authors who have appeared widely in journals and
magazines without receiving national recognition for their books as
evidenced with our recently published Simon Perchik and Richard Blevins
collections as well as the forthcoming Selected Poems by Alan Catlin, an
author with forty chapbooks.

Overall these publications, including the journal, have durability, as a
pavement saw does, 6 foot high & cutting, caring naught for history but
needing it to forward the blade. Any poet, worth their salt, knows their
beliefs, they defend the form. I have a few beliefs:

1.) The best service a journal can perform for a writer is to send the
material back immediately if there is any doubt. Sure we could hold onto
work for a year & arrive at the same decision, but by returning material
within three months, better submissions arrive overall. Unfortunately
the year+ time-trend set by established journals has influenced newer
journals to a new lack of ethics where returning materials to
contributors, quickly, or at all, is unimportant. While I admit it might
be nice to have the time to show "signs of real discrimination" for each
piece coming in: there is not. With over 2000 submissions for the
journal, say 13,000 poems, & 620 manuscripts this year, I do not
comment, I slice. Quick and abrupt judgements.

2.) There is too much crap in "experimental" poetries.

3.) There is too much crap in "traditional" poetries.

4.) These two coasts are unaware of each other. Each faction, including
unnamed others, want to rest where they are, comfortable in their
divisionary idea of poetry. Publishing the largest known names of each
section uses branding techniques to forward a paltry few lesser knowns.
Partitioning of the audience which is enhanced through marketing methods
based upon name recognition, race, sexual preference and other
characteristics has lead us to the primary question: how to create a
unified readership without creating more poets or lowering the medium’s
standard. Sure, a poet swimsuit calendar might sell, but at what cost to
the (i)deal? Our answer is in here, as well as in the five full length
titles and one chapbook released last year.

5.) I do not care what the author thinks of their own work, but
especially so when there is a underlying manipulative intent. This is
applies to any author, do not mistake this, we are pagists who have
learned the splitting of author and poem to the nth degree. We are the
readers and give fuck naught number one for authorial opinion, you
either send the poem into space freely, without ties, or it stays home
where its frail insecurities lie.

6.) Do not inflict yourself upon an audience with uninformed material.

7.) We run a pure organization. While this sounds awkward, consecration
to poetry is an incorruptible force. For this reason all of our contests
are chosen anonymously. Our sparsity of women authors in our book length
publications is directly caused by corruptible organizations. In fact,
we lost three titles due to publishers sudden need to “balance” their
title list with female authors. As these fickle publishers change their
policies yet again, we will be waiting. We also do not believe in the
policy of demanding our full length authors to pay for their own
advertising which has become standard with most university published
books.

8.) Poems about sex have to be as good as sex.

Guidelines: One must actualize the poem, be the container for that which
radiates forth. Until poems are realized and actuated, the form is
naught and merely a hiding place, a word field to meaninglessly spray
others with. Send 5 poems or prose with a signed cover letter, address
and e-mail. Expect to be rejected at least one time.


Be well

Revisionist History Part II

The author of the book about GW that was pulled from shelves during the 2000
campaign, JH Hatfield, was found dead in a hotel room on July 20 or 21, of
an apparent suicide.

http://chicago.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=3701&group=webcast

It seems Hatfield really messed with the wrong family, a family whose
personal fortune rests on the financing of Hitler, a Savings & Loan scandal,
wars of all sorts, weapons manufacture and distribution, general colonial
mentality, and the illegal drugs trade.  Oh, yeah, and oil, banking, and
intelligence.  Assassination.  Politics.  And baseball, too.

Author of a book that angered the Bushes, a most violent and skilled family.
Dead from an alleged suicide.  Pulled from St. Martins Press and bookshelves
across the nation, allegedly because Hatfield was a convicted felon.  Now
THAT'S power.

Coincidence?

Police say there will be no investigation of foul play.

The price of freedom.

Here's the Editors' Note to the current issue of Fence

"In the Context of No Context"

What good are literary magazines, she often wonders, as she works on one.
What should they accomplish? Sometimes the comments of a reader or a critic
reinforce the urgency of such questions, and this is helpful. Skeptical
self-questioning may transform into ambient self-doubt without the benefit
of re-direction, of sharpening. On the event, then, of having been
questioned, the editors reply with some notes toward a larger answer.

Should literary magazines be committed to a literary/political agenda?

She often likes to read magazines that express commitment to particular
agendas or communities of writers or lineages of thinking on writing. She
believes that magazines do this in order to affirm the inherent value of
community and to allow creative work to resonate with and support other
work that shares its commitments and methods. Nonetheless, her magazine
takes a different approach. She feels that much of what is valuable in
writing is larger than its own context(s). Some magazines should not try to
offer critical or historical agendas or contextualization to work they
publish. Others should try and then fail. Others should try and then
succeed. This is experiment. Literary magazines together are an experiment.
Parts of this experiment will be boring and parts will be crass and other
parts still will be exciting, and this is all to the good. She feels that
it is useful to note when parts of it are boring or crass or exciting or
enviable, and to note it with sympathy for the larger and shared endeavor.

A literary magazine is, among other things, a literary position. Must this
position be explicit?

She wishfully envisions a literary culture that values expressions of
confusion and contradiction. She wishes our educational system taught
tolerance for confusion and contradiction. She fears we are trying to
eliminate confusion and contradiction and that this could increase
ignorance and injustice. Ignorance and injustice often being relieved by
expressions of curiosity and generosity.

So perhaps a literary magazine might do well to function as a call for
attunement to-and metabolization of-alternate and dissonant ways of
thinking and being, as they are expressed in writing. These might include
radically new ways of thinking and being, old-fashioned but as yet untried
modalities, and "mainstream" but useful or even beautiful perspectives. A
call for attunement is not an exact science.

While she loves many poets and many poetics and also poetry that abjures
poetics, no one perspective she has yet encountered has been enough on its
own to make her want to give up the pleasures and potentials of every other
way of thinking/ being/reading/writing. Almost, as she is suggestible and
adventurous. But three or four perspectives together-together angrily, or
naively or tenderly or erotically, or in alienation from one another or
with magnetism toward one another or in irrelevance to one another:
overlapping, resonating, etc.-now, that seems enticing.

She features what she considers a strength, but which may well be called a
weakness in the larger picture: She does not wish to exclude. Exclusivity
is necessary to a great many worthy endeavors and processes. Nonetheless,
the inequities of the world being as cruel as they are and the dominance of
exclusion being as culpable as it is, she defines her politics and her
projects as inclusive rather than exclusive. This reinforces the potential
for stylistic/polemical drift or unmoored loyalties, and she tries her best
to navigate these risks and to produce new potentials from them.

Must a literary magazine necessarily take itself very seriously in order to be
important or illuminating or intellectual?

The ways in which art changes the world can be subtle. They can produce
negative changes. The changes can be long in coming and hard to predict.
She likes to think that a literary magazine can be skeptical, given these
possibilities, but loving. Without both skepticism and affection, an editor
is likely to miss a great deal. Missing a great deal is not an experiment
nor is it a shared endeavor nor is it likely to help readers or writers.
She loves some literary magazines for their awareness of their own
relationship to the reader, the poet, the larger culture-and she loves it
when some magazines affect that awareness in ways that are compelling and
offer insight: an analytic act. She also loves it when some literary
magazines posit a version of the literary universe that is slightly
utopian, possibly naive: an imaginative act. She prefers the latter
activity for her own endeavor because it complements her own abilities and
her temperament and her values. She doesn't think it's better; it's just
one way of being among other ways: necessary to the whole.

These are responses to one or two questions that have recently been posed
to her. Fence is also interested in responding to questions that have not
been and cannot be and should not be asked, hence the following 186 pages.
Your turn.

Spend lots of time in the Old Time.  Check out Prague Castle and the Charles
Bridge.  Make sure you catch the changing of the Town Hall clock.  Dine
along the Vltava.  Be prepared for people at restaurants and other
businesses to give you the wrong amount of change or ask you to pay when
you're supposed to pay someone else, or give you a differently priced
English menu, so always be aware.  Take advantage of fine dining
opportunities if you can...meals that would cost you $60-$100 (or more) in
the US will cost you about $20-$35 (700-1300 Kc) in Praha, but if you are
vegetarian, do proceed with caution.  The beer was also once very cheap
there, and probably still is. Absinthe is easily found in Prague.

Best,
Patrick Herron

I'm not an editor, but I was an assistant editor (of The Ohio Review--
so there's the aesthetic position for you I guess, wink-wink) for a time,
so, uh, I'll say something anyway.

I think that editors have to publish work they believe in. (Some would
say "work they like") I don't see how any journal can get away from
this. What is it that the band RUSH screached way back when? "If
you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice"? Which
becomes an aesthetic. (yada-yada, as they say)

But I must say that choosing not to cull something makes for boring
work. And though I don't enjoy POETRY magazine's aesthetic, I
think it's good they have (he has) one. And I know to stear clear.
Wheras Colorado Review or Denver Quarterly or Chicago Review, etc
etc, have identifyable aesthetic positions that I find consistently
engaging and fun. So I pick them up whenever I can.

I guess I don't see what all the fuss is about.

Pivotal Apothegms of the New Ophthalmologists
=20

1.        We recognize the hegemony of cool-sounding words, =
word-combinations and phrases that do not accrete into an artwork =
greater             than the sum of its parts must be stopped. In short, =
death to hipsterism in all its forms, the oxygen bar of the conventional =
and                     unimaginative.

            =B7         Cool words like "crenulate," "imbroglio," =
"rectilinear," "gossamer," "declension" and "rhododendron." Neat phrases =
like "as                     if angular," "of about a at and" and =
catch-all word combos like "unison gaudy shimmy diatribal."

2.        Good intentions are never enough (to buy you dinner).=20

3.        Anhedonia be damned.

=B7         Repression + artifice =3D divorce. It's nice to strut around =
in fancy clothes, but if you can't take them off, go back to Sunday      =
   school.

4.        Listserves are not liberating, multi-authored cineplex =
paradisios. Cyberverse is the Marinettism of today. Preciosity's special =
effects         have found a new home in W[eb]b A/r(gh)t. The more =
things stay the same, the more we should change.

5.        Radical, indeterminate syntax has the determinate effect of =
constricting the emotional arteries. Little emotions and broad gestures =
are         the mark of the devil.

6.        Art without darkness illuminates nothing. Lightness is =
necessary in order to salt the wound.

7.        The poem and poet rarely make friends. Those who talk about =
"co-participation" know this and try to substitute a happy, '50s-ish,    =
         "Leave it to Beaver" family relationship with the reader for =
the eternally unequal playing field of poet and poem. A real poem teases =
        the poet, stinging without end until shot down with word =
tranquilizer. A real poem is a permeable stockade.

=B7         We understand the logic behind the talk about =
"co-participation" - an ideology perfectly suited for our culture of     =
                    consumption. Let the reader do the work, while the =
poet sits back and receives his or her complimentary hand job.

8.        No genre is inherently greater than the next. Genre-crashing =
by professional genre-bangers is not inherently superior to working in   =
          received forms. Genre-crashing has become a received form.

9.        Two good hypernyms won't save your soul. Alternately, "I am =
still trying to live up to my blue china" - Wilde.

10.     Backscratching is tedious work.

11.     Poetry comes closest to music when it's song. Current analogies =
that poets draw between their work and techno or mixing beats are        =
 laughable. Does Eshleman expect us to believe his work is Paleolithic? =
Yes he does. The cave must be soundproof.

12.     An explanatory poetry is a crime against all art. Art that is =
all critique is rarely enough.

13      Smartness is overrated and betrays a sheepish desire for =
respectability. Likewise, the obsession with technical innovation        =
                     degenerates into a concern for proper form and =
discursive behavior. In short, "cultural" capital and social standing. =
In short,                     academic politics.

14      To privilege language or 'meaning production' as the ideal =
subject matter of poetry is provincial to the core. If language were     =
                adequate to experience there would be no need to write a =
poem.

=B7         We applaud that poetry which displays a true love of =
language and word play. We are tired of those who heroicize Stein        =
     but continue to produce texts as pleasurable as a tetanus shot.

15      To advance a poetry based on its subject matter is as futile as =
advancing one based on form. To champion one form over all others is     =
    a form of cultural chauvinism similar to that of the "English-only" =
group.

16      The formal debate is a waste of precious airtime. To argue which =
is better, for example, metaphor or metonymy, is an insult to poetry.

17      One perception must fuck with another. Or the poem dies from =
lack of tension, conflict (meaning).

=B7         Opacity tends to be a poor substitute for ambiguity and =

18      A poem is not an example of fully rationalized aesthetic praxis. =

21      Death to comfortable irony, which spreads whenever the literary =
overtakes the real. Irony is a linguistic phenomenon that deals with =
pre-inscribed meanings and how these contradict each other. To banish =
irony is ironic.

22      In a N.O. poem, the I is endangered, threatened, fighting for =
air.

23      Great art is characterized by how much of the world it can =
embrace (engage). This has nothing to do with a range of reference or =
how         many meanings can be generated per line.

24      Humor should inflict some kind of injury. Remember the essence =
of the cante jondo celebrated by Lorca: to weep beautifully. As          =
       some MC said, "I can't feel nothin' unless it's lethal."

25      Free the language microscopes from the lab. We propose to =
manufacture instead infrared goggles to see in this darkness. To         =

=B7         To see how one sees and thinks takes work. We are not =

26      When your dreams feel more real than anything you've experienced =
over the last two months, what time are we in?

27      We do not locate autonomy in the word, in the sign =

magic.

=B7         Autonomy and freedom are not givens, but must be fought for. =
Marginality and difference, or "non-normativity", do not             =
equal autonomy. "Unrepresentative" work does not automatically create =
autonomy.

28.   As the tactician says, "Moments belong to us."

29.     Language itself is a fragment.

imaginary constructions.

Trying to determine who under fifty may be great is extremely
hard simply because there are so many poets writing, and it is
so easy to find greatness in one of them which is only borrowed
from another with whose work one is unfamiliar.  I would prefer to
answer the question, who under fifty has written at least one
poem of the first rank?  A few I can think of (and I'm also
handicapped by not knowing the ages of many poets; that said, I
have to admit that I have definitely lost touch with poets under
thirty; I do know a few, but . . .): Geof Huth, Crag Hill, Jake
Berry . . .  I refuse to even say which poems of theirs I consider
first-rank.  I'm just answering Patrick's question.

As for the fifty or over, three just into that bracket that have
written first-rate poems, and that I am willing to deem great are
Jonathan Brannen, Stephen-Paul Martin and Mike Basinski.  The living
American poet of whose greatness I am most confident is John M.
Bennett (though that doesn't mean I am confident that the
world will ever agree with me).

What in the world does nihilism have to do with the idea that
an individual has the right, finally, to do whatever he wants to with
his own body?  Surely that suggests a person's body is meaningful,
and nihilism is the doctrine that nothing is meaningful.

A person can also be called great for doing great work regardless
of what the world says about him.  For instance, if Pollock is
forgotten in fifty years, it won't mean he wasn't really great (as
the first to do his kind of significantly new painting), only that
posterity is stupid and/or has a lousy memory.  Ditto for certain
Pollock-level culturateurs, as I call them, who never win anything
like the notice Pollock did.

Note: this is a Mere Assertion that I refuse to Argue for at this time.

Sorry to jump in on this one rather late in the day--I only read the list
via the web at the moment.  But I've been editing magazines now since the
early 1990s, first a grad-student journal (my first taste of committee-work:
ugh), most recently (from 1998 on) _The Gig_, a chapbook poetry magazine, &
so I can't help putting in my two cents.

Not to be offensive but in my books it doesn't count as "editing" if you
don't reject anything.  (I recall my efforts in writing up an account of the
editing of _The English Intelligencer_, a UK 1960s worksheet--Peter Riley,
who edited its 2nd series, was firm about my registering a distinction
between those parts of its lifespan in which it was "edited" & those in
which it was "assembled".) -- Aesthetic pluralism is fine--Baraka & McKuen
side by side, if you like--assuming that's the aim of the magazine, but any
editor worth his/her salt is going to have to be ruthless with the rejection
slips.  Or did you simply mean to say "I don't reject any aesthetic fields
out of hand"?  I might be more sympathetic to that position, though as it
happens I'm usually happiest with poetry journals that are quite specialized
in focus (& preferably have some toothy prose in them too).

The reason for a firm editorial hand is that one is, as an editor,
implicitly acting as an advocate for the poets included, which means
providing a compelling vehicle for their work.  & that requires that one try
as hard as possible to make the magazine consistently good--consistently
wonderful if at all possible.  Readers will pick and choose among an issue's
contents, certainly, but it's the editor's job to make that a pleasurable as
opposed to frustrating experience.

Semiramis if I Remember
(self-portrait as mask)

Keith Waldrop

The third installment of the trilogy that includes The Locality =
Principle
(Avec Books, 1995) and The Silhouette of the Bridge (Avec Books, 1997)

=A7

Seimramis if I Remember is a quietly remarkable meditation on life and
death. Poet Keith Waldrop has seen much of both, and here turns his
attention to all that can get lost in living, attempting to evoke and
remember what remains. Waldrop's 16th book of poetry offers the reader
instants from the whole life of the poet, from his earliest childhood
memories and encounters with the possibilities of language to his later
years of reflections, dreams, and vigorous struggles with darkness.  =
With
their references to the gothic and a pervasive recognition of absence,
these are haunted poems. But whatever their sadness, they are haunted =
not
simply by thoughts of death but by life, a life that means more because =
it
passes, because its beauty is what slips away from us.

=A7

Praise for Semiramis:

Completing a trilogy that includes The Locality Principle and The
Silhouette of the Bridge, Waldrop--professor at Brown University, =
co-editor
of Burning Deck Press and leading light of experimental poetry--deals in
premature death, aged death, biblical death...good death... [and] the
shifting subjectivity of death. Cumulatively, these absences afford
preponderant evidence of life, which, in this booklength series, quietly
and purposefully makes for a positive proof: " I look at them/and wonder
what it was I was trying to photograph.//I piss into the bowl, The sound
reassures me.//...The World  begins in the evening. The year
begins in /winter."    -Publishers Weekly

*

Praise for the trilogy:

"This is one slim volume that emanates a strange magic, haunting, witty
aphoristic."
-The San Francisco Chronicle (on The Silhouette of the Bridge)

"One of the most important  writers, translators and publishers of
avant-garde literature in our time."
-Publishers Weekly (on The Silhouette of the Bridge)


"Waldrop writes for those who like to read a poem more than once, not
because they didn't understand it the first time,  but because it was =
such
a pleasure. His words just don't dissolve, but hold in the reader's mind
and mouth with a delicious aftertaste."
-American Book Review (on The Locality Principle)

Were Dodie and I the only ones watching "WE" channel last night,
Women's Entertainment and the Cinematherapy series came on and they
showed Judy Blume's "Forever" from 1978?  The film opens with two
teen girls headed for a wild party in the Marin headlands and Diana
Scarwid is the hostess.  Then the party starts with a montage of
everyone having fun, smoking cigarettes, pairing off, drinking beers,
lots of cocktail party conversation, dancing, (to Cherchez La Femme
that old soul hit from the 1970s) and there's this poetry girl
sitting there on a couch reciting poetry, the camera cuts back to
her, and Dodie screams, "She looks just like Cole Swenson!"  Then we
both screamed, "It is Cole Swenson!"  -- But young, or even younger
than she is now.  She looks like she's about 15 but even so, even if
you weren't watching the screen, that deep enchanting whiskey voice
would give her away!  The film was made 1978 by John Korty, we kept
watching and watching but alas the main plot of the story took over,
Stefanie Zimbalist falls in love for the very first time with this
dweeb boy who used to play Almanzo in "Little House of the Prairie."
Actually Stephanie is pretty good, but we just wanted to see more of
Cole!!!  PS, in the credits it says, "Poet . . . Cole Swenson."  YAY!
More poets in the movies!!  Hooray for "Cinematherapy"!

Dear Ammonides@AOL.COM

Some of my favorite band names found on punk rock posters in providence
mid-ninties . . .


"Cosmic Vulva"
"Violent Anal Death"
were two I remember

Traveling the punk circuit in Europe my favorites were this guy named
"Pig Havoc" in England and the first hardcore band in Italy- Syd Migx's
"Cheetah Chrome Motherfuckers" which I think is better than "Oedipus and th=
e
 Motherfuckers,"
I have to agree with your sons - your names are too literary
but I think you should right now write poems with those titles

"Chairman Meow" or "Crisco" were my band names which
you can use but they are probably not right either

Allen Ginsberg supposedly named The Blake Babies which works -
I'll keep thinking if you write one of those poims.

Hi,

        Whenever I get email warnings like this, I check them out at the Urban
Legends web page (http://www.urbanlegends.com) to see if they are true.
Here is the page on this one:
http://www.urbanlegends.com/ulz/90pound.html.  Basically, there is a
grain of truth in it, but most of us have nothing to worry about and
should not pass on this email.

I find "a keen understanding of the marketplace" an interesting term to use.
Are poets a "marketplace" to be "cracked"? Is there a "surface" to be "risen
to"? "Strategy" is more important than "good art"? (I would like to hear
that "convincing argument"...) If someone comes at us with the "right"
publication with the "right" editing, then we, as poetic consumers, will
consume? Maybe we should do a focus group and a market analysis. Poets, get
your credit cards ready!

erratically to look for event & publication listings, but I was recommended
to this discussion, so am trying to pick it up a bit. Did it begin with
someone saying that the "product" of a magazine was "only" or "just" or
"merely" x? What an ungenerous and flip statement! Sounds like someone has
an uncle on his shoulder, as an old friend used to say.

It=92s hard for me to say, like Ken Bolton, who is "uninformed". We all see=
m a
little, and over-informed too, agenbite of inwit and all that. I build
taxonomies for a living, so the "positive" advocacy of "systematic" and
"consistent" "values" he enjoins seems like so much on-the-job
training...what is this job?!... arewriters simply taxi-drivers to some
fundamental entity-types that are not fuzzy to the touch? Can I get there
from here, will the elegantly formulated proposition be my passport?

Explicit prose, formal, consensual =97- of which one species is the editori=
al
statement =96=96 always feels to me like so many corrected sympathies. Do w=
e
admire the effort? Does the organized room signal commitment? And what is
actual here, the "signaling" or the "commitment"? Does the signal prove the
poem? Yikes! Do we need a good summary, because we fear we will never win
the poem for the world otherwise?

I still think the tacit prospect for the critic is a beautiful argument, an=
d
that even a critic like Steve Evans, whose formal essays are as courageous
as they are programmatic and predictive, is practically an aesthete, in tha=
t
he prefers a fundamentally abstract architecture of progressive statement t=
o
the "open work", which cannot demonstrate a doubtless synthesis. It=92s
synthesis that=92s the bugaboo, no? I=92m really afraid of it myself, the
totalizing ecumenical gesture, the privilege and cruelty of that oversight.
But I=92m ready to admit to a certain nominalism, and the ecstacy that I fi=
nd
in small gathered details, because how do you frame sleep or the snowflake,
etc, etc Words and ideas are beautiful, let=92s get lost, me too!=20

And is the "beautiful" still distasteful? Have we argued it away? More than
any other word, it=92s "beautiful" that Mac and I get about the Germ. Ha! H=
ow
often do you hear that word any more? How=92s that for editorial focus! I
think the orchid can break kneecaps! I think the right song can stop a
soldier in his tracks! and it=92s a certain want of Beauty that we share wi=
th
our great uncles who began the magazine, and by Beauty I mean an aggressive
confluence of lucid attention, improbable arrival and deeply felt surprise.
Zizek lisped when he called it "magic moments". Is that liberating? Well,
it=92s enthusiastic!

The Germ is probably an early Modern magazine. And Mac really values humor,
I know that to be true. It=92s "an absolute necessity," I=92ve heard him sa=
y.=20

The most outlandish thing I remember from the Third Factory debate oh how
long ago was that an editorial stance that signals itself through "pictures
and jokes" is a fundamental nothing, an embarrassment. What a fortunate
self-promotion for the critic! Is there nothing to a film, a print, an
etching? Do we distrust the comic impulse? What of curatorship,
demonstration, revelation in context? Go see the Joe Brainard show at once!
Read Miekel Bal=92s book on Caravaggio! See Walter Murch=92s new edit of
Apocalyse Now and tell me that he has "merely" "gathered" or juxtaposed
"content".  Then watch Coppola=92s exegetical editorializing in the new Fre=
nch
plantation scene and tell me that it does not confuse or ruin the film! Sur=
e
it contextualizes the war, but what what? So does The Nation. I would say
that the rookie manifesto of that one scene in relation to the rest of the
film is perfectly symmetrical to the relationship between Apex of the M=92s
editorial statements and the contributions from their poets. Less than one
percent of Apex of the M=92s 900+ pages (six issues) was editorial statemen=
t.
And Earnest lumpy breath at that! That Mark considers it a singular "that
sort of project" which no one has continued may have more to do with a
certain era of pitched debate on this list (and the nostalgia for it) than
anything else. What about Chain=92s project? Shark, Kenning, Combo, Outlet.
There=92s a certain love of discursive statement about. It=92s not over, ev=
en if
it is often over my head. I still can=92t quite relate Michael Magee=92s pr=
eface
in Combo 8 to the work of Kristen Gallagher or Rodrigo Toscano, or for that
matter, "The Insurgent Word" of Apex 3 to Kevin Killian=92s astonishing
Argento poems in Apex 6. The relationship isn=92t synthetic or essential. I=
t=92s
apposite, accompanying, supplemental. And that=92s okay. There=92s enthusia=
sm.
There=92s consideration. But in general I come curious, and for the poetry.

How do we compare? What carries more force, which is more effective: Henry
Green=92s Loving or Christopher Hitchens=92 two part case against Kissinger=
 in
Harpers? Is the effort commensurate? I read both this year, both are
essential, they cohabit in me =96=96 are they at war? Am I the synthesis? A=
m I
an editor?

At least one of the lessons in the Germ I know is in tune with that of
Sullivan=92s Travels, the workers and roughnecks alive in laughter at the
small good and funny film. And I think a single film by Sokurov will keep
more folks alive than the entire text of "Pre-Capitalist Economic
Formations". I know that Kiarostami=92s Close-Up will make more people ride
public transit and vote progressively that the New Sentence will (it took m=
e
a month and a half to read it!). I think the films love us more, as do the
best poems of Edwin Denby and the diary of John Wieners. Predictive
synthesis is exhausting, but the Art-That-Loves-You promotes enthusiasm.
After I read David Shapiro=92s "18. Ode" in A Man Holding an Acoustic Panel=
, I
was compelled to clean the house!

And I read more magazines than books it=92s true. I like the company. The b=
est
hands down at the moment are David Larsen and Beth Murray=92s San Jose Manu=
al
of Style, Jubilat out of UMass, and the brilliant and seductive Cabinet. A
little eccentric each, bravo! I=92m not fond of magazines that simply check
the weather, take a census, that are inclusive and do what=92s right at the
expense of showing us what they care about. Show us! Stick it to me! Stick
it in me! Are these the poets? Is that what you=92re talking about? Hell, I=
=92d
rather be in love. I=92d rather be enthusiastically so!

The literature is inconsistent.

1.3.c What the Fuck is String Theory?


String theory attaches itself to the troth
that string will tether heart to mind or body
to soul.  String theorists often save roll
so as to keep abuttal of the physical & ephemeral
when cloth of breath or heart threatens to depart.
Filament may avert the many versions of vital release.

This is fine if that's what you want to go by, but it doesn't seem that
helpful in terms of what "great" conveys to most people in everyday usage.

It should go without saying, but just for the sake of clarity, it's also
important to distinguish between little-G great (as in "Mmm, great coffee"
or "Oh yeah, I like Garrett Caples, he's great") and capital-G great (as in
"she was the great love of my life" or "Conrad's _Chance_ is a fascinating
novel, but not a great one").

Capital-G greatness is plainly what we're concerned with here, and again at
the risk of stating the obvious, we can break it down further into a few
qualifying categories:

1) Global capital-G.  The work or author in question is extremely widely
read and disseminated either academically or popularly over long periods of
time, preferably centuries.  In this category we could place the Koran,
Sappho, Dante, Shakespeare, Jane Austen, etc.  Texts in this category are
influential to the point of monumentalism, both on the works of other
writers and on our concepts of literature in general.  Greatness so defined
is as much a function of canonization and public relations, etc., as of any
"intrinsic literary value" in the works (and those scare quotes are intended
not so much to debunk the notion of an absolute aesthetic value as to signal
the subjective conditions under which such judgments are frequently
performed).  These are texts likely to be familiar, at least in name, to
readers without specialized education.  One need not even have read them in
order to ascertain the evidence of their greatness: it is practically a
material fact, self-evident and self-sustaining.

2) Institutional capital-G.  This would include works and authors in the
above category, but expand to include those whose influence is constrained
within narrower (i.e., purely academic) parameters.  Examples: Simonides,
John Gower, Felicia Hemans, and Countee Cullen.  Note that in some cases,
i.e. Hemans, the institutionalization of the author coincides with immense
popularity in her own time, but that such popularity is only conditionally
relevant to the designation of greatness; what counts is prolonged
circulation in a context of historical relevance as defined by specialists.
Again, in the case of Cullen, there are at least two levels within this
institutional category on which greatness might be gauged: the author's
influence with a framework of "minority" literature, and his significance in
relation to literary modernism.  These levels are of course interrelated,
but the important point is that both are determined _historically_:
aesthetic considerations are secondary to the process by which lines of
influence and positions within a tradition or traditions are drawn after the
fact.  In other words, the question whether Hemans or Cullen are "good"
poets is largely irrelevant to their "greatness" as thus conceived.  I'm
willing to wager that this is the definitional level most readers on this
list would be quickest to revile as cynical and destructive, but it
nonetheless represents something like an "objective" measure, in that it
reduces the question of greatness to statistically confirmable criteria like
syllabus content, PMLA indices, anthologization, etc.

3) Absolute capital-G.  Arguably not a category unto itself, but either a)
an effect produced or sustained ideologically by the mechanisms of
institutionalization outlined above, or b) an effect of "subjective
aesthetic response," to borrow Barrett Watten's term, whose exact criteria
may be incoherent or inconsistent.  Within this definition, Shakespeare or
Cullen or Rod McKuen are "great" either because they they effect a certain
condition of receptiveness and appreciation in their readers, or because
they _are said to do so_.  Of course, it matters _who_ is saying they do so.
  One can draw radically different conclusions about the sort of
mystification involved depending on whether one believes the appreciation
derived from a given text has its source in the reader's own internal
standards of aesthetic value (perhaps derived from a lifetime of reading and
evaluating, say), or in the reader's susceptibility to the suggestion of
such qualities in the work as would _seem_ to be perceived by the reader
according to internal standards but are actually imposed by some other
agency (schoolteachers, jacket design, word of mouth).  The reason I
consider these part of the same level is that both invoke the idea of a
metaphysical greatness hovering around or above the object, unreducible to
the purely material processes of historical transmission and publicization
mentioned in levels 1 and 2.  In short, the main problem with this as a
proposal for what defines greatness is that it's _not_.  It leaves the
question squarely in the mind of each reader, unanswerable on the one hand
because what one likes is simply what one likes, or on the other hand
because what one likes is what one has been told one likes.

4) Socio-pragmatic capital-G.  One way of thinking of this level is as a
version of the kind of institutional activity described in level 2 broken
down into discrete communities of appraisal and consent.  Hence, Rosmarie
Waldrop would be considered great by a sizeable percentage of a certain
community of readers, and Gary Soto by another, and neither one by the other
community (on average), and the criteria on either side would be roughly
equivalent: Does this writer address the concerns of the literary community
with which I feel myself most aligned?  Does she produce a substantial body
of work that is consistently representative of a more or less consistent set
of aesthetic standards as explicitly or implicitly imagined by that
community?  Is his work distinctive enough in some way to stand out among
the works of other members of the community without in so doing rendering
the aesthetics of the community invalid?  Another way of thinking about it
(which may be the same way viewed from the opposite angle) is as a
cooperative alliance built upon the subjective aesthetic response model of
level 3: readers with given tendencies of aesthetic response find
like-minded readers and band together into coalitions.  There is bound to be
in-fighting and sub-faction formation, of course, but by and large one
Language poet or New Formalist or Stegner Fellow or whatever is going to
display a considerable amount of consistency in favoring or eschewing a lot
of the same texts as others of his/her kind.  I think it's pretty clear that
no one is going to be happy with this model.  It turns the whole question of
greatness into one of conformity and limited (yawn) transgression.

So where does that leave us?  For my money, back at level 1.  An author is
great if she becomes Great.  And as I said, that usually takes centuries, or
at least some posthumous period of appreciation.  For this reason, debates
about what living authors (especially authors under 50!) are Great are
always going to be speculation at best.  Speculation can be fun, however, so
I'm going to say that if any living poets have the smell of greatness about
them, Ashbery is certainly one of them.  His appeal for many partisans on
either side of the divides that gape between the various "scenes," his
relative saleability and mainstream publishing status juxtaposed to his
origins within an avant-garde, and his widespread anthologization all speak
favorably for him.  Also, he works within and against tradition in inventive
and resonant ways that give his work the feel of being in an intense
dialogue (albeit a screwy one) with literary history.  He manages to
generate an effect of elegant Romantic complexity without resorting to
slavish, forced metrical practice.  On top of all this, and maybe most
importantly, he _appeals_ to a wide number of readers who may know or care
nothing for the other factors I've mentioned; someone new to poetry thumbing
through a _New Yorker_ might come upon one of his poems and enjoy a
painterly rush of bewilderment.

Patrick suggested "that a great poet controls the poems they send into the
ethos, and while they may have individual early poems or even later ones
that appear in journals, in regards to a full length collection only the
great poems are published."  I'm not at all comfortable with this notion of
control, or with fixing on how or how often one publishes as a standard for
judgment.  What does control over transmission have to do with the greatness
of Sappho, Shakespeare, Dickinson?  And the whole idea of great poems versus
great books seems totally fraught.  I'd say, for example, that _Harmonium_
is a great book whose sum of parts adds up to more than one might expect
from isolated samples.  Why should a great book be any less valid as a
marker of its author's achievement than individual poems?  (Or vice versa.)

In sum, Greatness is just too unstable and corrupt a term to be any use.  I
propose that we abandon it in favor of Wonderfulness.  Just think of all the
Wonderful poets you know!

Much easier, isn't it?

Jim--thanks for the clarification.  I don't think it especially changes my
point.  My own policy with _The Gig_ has been "no unsolicited material", but
I've had nonetheless to also turn down solicited work sometimes: definitely
not fun to do but it seems to me unavoidable & essential to the whole

1) anyone who has Keith Tuma's Oxford anthology who wants my list of
corrections & additions can drop me a line & I'll send a copy.  Nothing I'm
too embarrassed about, but I've made discoveries since the book went to
press, & also found a few small goofs.

2) I thought while I'm at it I'd repeat an occasional offer of mine.  _The
Gig_ fills out the space at the bottom of the last page with a paragraph of
notes on contemporary poetry.  Anyone who sends me a note that I use will
get a free issue of the magazine.  The notes tend to focus on UK poetry
(notably Prynne) but that's just because that's the poetry I've been writing
on lately (esp. in annotating Keith's book): contributions dealing with any
of the US, Canadian &c poetries that concern this list are welcome.  Credit
is given for contributions.  _The Gig_ 9 will appear in a couple of weeks
(assuming my laser printer can be induced to start working properly again),
so if you want a copy of it (shameless plug here: it'll have Trevor Joyce,
Diane Ward, David Chaloner, Ian Patterson, William Fuller, Bill Griffiths &
a long poem-report on the Liege conference by Shelby Matthews, plus an essay
on Denise Riley by Robin Purves)...then get back to me shortly.

Here's the notes that appeared in _The Gig_ 8:

For the dedication to Raworth's _Writing_ ("to the moles and to the bats")
see Isaiah 2:20.  "i have set my face / as a flint" ("South America") is
from Isaiah 50:7.  The last poem of _Sentenced to Death_ is collaged from
phrases from Barthes' _Camera Lucida_.

The link between the opening invocation of Heidegger's "The Thing" in R.F.
Langley's "Juan Fernandez," the image of the jug, and Defoe's _Robinson
Crusoe_, is perhaps Virginia Woolf's essay on Crusoe in The Common Reader
(2nd series).

"O man for thy sake" in Prynne's _Word Order_ is from the anonymous
religious lyric "Woefully arrayed" [the William Cornysh setting of which I
highly recommend --ed.].  "A whiff of new-mown hay" is the usual description
of the odour of diphosgene, used by the Germans in WWI; presumably
"bitter...almond" in the same poem touches on the smell of cyanide (& thus
on the use of Zyklon-B in the death-camps?).

Peter Riley's _Preparations_ is based, poem by poem, on Blake's _Poetical
Sketches_.

"Passa la nave mia colma d'oblio / per aspro mare" (quoted in John Riley's
"Prelude") is the opening of Petrarch, Rime 189 (the poem behind Wyatt's "My
galley, charged with forgetfulness").   In "Czargrad," "la pluie, goutte à
goutte" is from Pierre Louÿs's _Songs of Bilitis._


[the notes above deal with allusion-hunting mostly but that needn't be the
only topic, of course: I'm especially keen in the case of Prynne to have
some of the arcaner specialist jargon & discourses explained clearly. --N]

The Habitable World
by Beth Anderson
80 pages
ISBN 0-9679854-1-2
$10

"Kafka was right, impatience is a form of laziness. Patience, on the =
other hand, as demonstrated in Beth Anderson's poems, is a form of =
controlled energy, a painstaking, unflappable attention. Anderson has =
built The Habitable World slowly and with a steely calm. She is fearless =
and will not be hurried. Her poetry, like our world, embodies time. =
Reader, if you enter these poems, you will live inside them and they =
will live in you." -- William Corbett

"With their gorgeous locutions and turns, their heady breath, Beth =
Anderson's poems haunt, inhabit, and conjure the world we carry and =
contemplate in our daily passage through landscape and language. This =
delicate world so disclosed is here made luminous in stunning detail." =
-- Peter Gizzi

"Beth Anderson writes intellectual lyrics whose smooth, confident =
surfaces mask stunning dislocations. It is clear in these accomplished =
poems that what is 'habitable' about the world is as much a matter of =
the language in which it is presented as it is of the objects, =
landscapes, and autobiography that ripple throughout." -- Charles North

        Dodie,

        Christina Aguilara is the whitest looking pop star. More of a sex worker
than singer and by no means great, but for a woman of color all she could
hope for is substance. This is not trying to dismiss you, Dodie, you know I
love you.

        Best, Geoffrey

Perhaps you could have chosen someone other than a woman of color as
the source of your ridicule?

"I'm not fond of magazines that simply check the weather, take a census,
that are inclusive and do what's right at the expense of showing us what
they care about. Show us! Stick it to me! Stick it in me!"

says Andrew Maxwell;

while it continues to amaze me that it is so difficult for anyone to
believe that anyone could actually "care about" inclusiveness--or, even
more incredible, "care about" (can we just say "like"?) individually the
poems that, as different as they are, create the weather.

 From Cassie Lewis:

As far as judgements about her parenting etc, it is all about speculation,
isn't it? So why then the need for evidence? I have a distaste for holding
parents responsible for anything and everything, as though their lives
stopped when they had kids, and by extension as though there weren't a
bigger social context for Plath's depression.

From me, Rachel:

Mothers are just women, yes?

Yes, in fact I am trying to figure out why so many women, single, lesbian,
married etc, my age (35-40--yes I am many) are popping out little ones with
great enthusiasm.  After having so many choices does it seem like the only
one?  Or do we do it cuz we can? Or is it an act of mimesis.  i don't think
women could possibly believe they'd be more valued by the culture as
mothers.

And speaking of the culture, did any of you read the article in the Business
section of yesterday's (Friday, Aug 10) Times about the "Bully Broads"--a
group that women execs are sent to by their male bosses when they are deemed
too tough.  It's like a corporate gulag or AA where you must see and confess
the error of your ways in order to begin to progress toward gentleladiness.
Is the power of the corporate entity in getting these women to these groups
to reform and confess just monetary?  (Not to mention the funeral for
feminism)(BTW--it takes place in bay area)

Lastly on the topic of culture--I just read this book by Rene Girard call
The Scapegoat and am wondering if anyone has read it too.  He finds in the
Gospels the first major text that provides the tools for the culture to
begin to move away from violent epiphanies by making them obvious.  Is he a
catholic or a pacifist?

Would love feedback on Girard: Levitsk@attglobal.net

Dear Ammonides@AOL.COM

Some of my favorite band names found on punk rock posters in providence
mid-ninties . . .


"Cosmic Vulva"
"Violent Anal Death"
were two I remember

Traveling the punk circuit in Europe my favorites were this guy named
"Pig Havoc" in England and the first hardcore band in Italy- Syd Migx's
"Cheetah Chrome Motherfuckers" which I think is better than "Oedipus and the
 Motherfuckers,"
I have to agree with your sons - your names are too literary
but I think you should right now write poems with those titles

"Chairman Meow" or "Crisco" were my band names which
you can use but they are probably not right either

Allen Ginsberg supposedly named The Blake Babies which works -
I'll keep thinking if you write one of those poims.

Ways of not writing from the self, of not controlling, include focusing =

Well, since the daug days of August have depleted The List to a two-topic
dilemma ("Hmm.  Shall I reply to 'Sylvia's Visions'--- OR to 'edit,
editing, editamus, editant'?  Hm.  Sylvia Plath great/non-great? [now
there's a tough one! Regis' "Wants to Be A Millionaire" offers 4-choice
Sylvia questions!]? magazine editing great/Plath-ish?)---  I thought it
might save time if we just fused the two:

If Sylvia Plath had lived (Counterfactuality Logic mode kicking in) and
were editor of a journal today, what would she say, which glossy would she
be edittting, which of the four teenage band members would she recognize as
hetero . . . ? which words would see see on her forehead? (and mightn't it
have been Great SYLVIA [scorched eternal damination fright wig] who left
mischievous Freud-like "Father!  Father!  Wake up!  I am burning in the
next room while you sleep!" message on NEWLYWED SONDHEIMS' answering
machine!?  Nikuko jealous of recent Sylvia-reincarnation marriage?)

sonnet(14)

the way it works it begins with an equivalence annulled:
0 -> f(x)
this refuses to hold the quantity changes such that
0(t) -> f(x)(t+1) so that it becomes necessary to create
0(t) > f(x)(t+n) where n = minimum of 2 so that
a surplus continues to exist
let the phrase = [U] or universe of travel/travail
on the road, in the midst of travel
0 -> 1
so that _now_ t(0) i write _ahead of the game_
which is the game of _textual production_
a series of texts T0, T1, ... Tn
therefore i am capable of keeping up the _appearance_
of textual creativity by always writing ahead of myself

This seems like a "'good'" starting point to me:

and for me it turns on the psychological perspective the Pennebaker article
hits on - an ethical writer is one who can express 'we' rather than 'I'?
This is something I'm feebly discovering in my old age and I'd be interested
in ideas about ways it could be taught.  I can see how it happens in the
therapeutic arena but I'm not sure if i could give you any sources to look
into.

I think it also relates to what you said about life experience but the
analogy is somewhat muddied as one doesn't have to have lived through a
trauma, for example, to help someone else deal with it.  Does one need to
have lived through WWII (to take a non-controversial event as an example) to
write well about 'our' experience of it?

Hey there, listfolks,

I know what you're thinking.  It's hot, it's humid, and the academic
year is about to start.  You're miserable and don't know what to do with
your time.  You'd like to read a poetry magazine, but lifting those
heavy pages seems like too much of an effort.  What's a poet to do?

Luckily, we here at Samizdat have cooked up a solution:

SAMIZDAT IS NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE

Don't fret, newsprint afficinados: we're still doing paper editions.
But thanks to my genius student web guru Kate Swoboda (editor of Ennui
magazine, http://www.ennuimagazine.com/) we're starting to put our full
content online at:

http://www.samizdateditions.com/

Right now you can get the ROTHENBERG/JORIS issue, and others will
follow.

  Hey all-

  Soft Skull needs your help!  You know our books. We publish authors
that  speak truth to the controlling forces of our society, that
highlight humanity and the importance of resistance. The world has
paid us some attention for this. We won the Firecracker Best
Independent Press Award in 2000. We've been in the Washington Post
and the New York Times. We've had two best sellers. Hell, we've even
been on 60 Minutes. We recognize that these are not the truly
important things, only measurements of our accomplishments. The truly
amazing things happen when no one one's looking, when people are
exposed to new ideas and those ideas go off like flashbulbs in their
brain.

  The books Soft Skull Press has published over the past eleven years
have had positive effects on people's lives. Now we are facing the
very frightening possibility of going under in the next two or three
months. We are one more voice against the dominant power structure of
our society. And we are in danger of becoming silent.

  There are ways you can help us out. We're working on planning
fundraisers in New York. Plan a fundraiser for us in your town. Throw
a party. Get your band to play. Get some poets to read. Show films no
one has seen before. Spread the word. In exchange for your trouble
we'll give you Soft Skull shirts, books, and a lifetime discount on
merch you order from us. We'll help you out in whatever way we can.

  This is serious. We need your help. We wouldn't be asking if we didn't.

I have the deepest respect for the patient and laborious work you and Keith
have performed in creating this anthology, but too I must make my note of
discord, altho' you have trawled through the books as ever British realities
are misrepresented again, if anyone wants a truer account of recent British
poetry they can go to www.chidesplay.8m.com  where an essay by Andrew Duncan
lies waiting, or too to an essay by Jon Corelis somewhere else on the Web.

You do not own us, managerial tho' your instincts may be, Britain in reality
is a tiny place, about the size of the State of Kansas, but with about 60
million people crammed into it, along with the blandest and most stable
class-hegemony in the world. The result is simmering tension, if you don't
believe that read Khaled Hakim, read Tim Allen, read Andrew, even, god
forbid, read me! We're angry, and with a reason.

I say this in a spirit of no ill-will, I know you and I have had our
differences, and again I do admire what you and Keith have done: 's a lot
better than nuffink.

All the Best

Dave

Here in Ireland we have a promising candidate in Ronan Keating, lead singer
with a boy band before he went solo.

Our benevolent government, as part of its millennium celebrations,
commissioned him to write a Millennium Song. The assignment proved too
weighty for him and the song never materialised, to the considerable
embarrassment of all concerned.

He's white and male too.

Much of this editorial conversation has focused on
an editor's job of rejecting poets.  Some have written
about how central a process it is, how ruthless they
are in rejecting work, and how, really, that is the only
job of an editor.

Why did you start your magazine, editor?  To say
"no" or "yes?"  Does any reader care, or know, who
an editor has said "no" to?  Should magazines
take a page to list the names of poets who's work
didn't make the cut, underlining this crucial editorial
role?

Sending rejections, when done, should not be done
with relish, or with the attitude: "You have not earned
a space in my magazine, little poet, come back in 6
months."

Monkeys can be trained to slip rejection letters into
envelopes, lick them shut and drop them in the mail.
No editor shows their mettle saying "no." It's odd, in
David's statement to say, "We could have had some
famous poets, but what they sent us sucked." Or
"expect to be rejected at least one time."

No reader of magazines has posted to this list, "I
admire magazine X and magazine Y because they
really reject a lot of poets, good for them.  I hear they
rejected John Ashbery, Maya Angelou and Jim Behrle.
Hooray."

And if a poet should expect to be rejected "at least one
time" is that about the poet's work?  There's no poet out
there who might just have enough going on to break
through the first time?

OK, I'm being flip, I haven't had any coffee yet.  But c'mon.
Calling myself an editor doesn't automatically make me
the authority on all American poetries.  And so, yeah, I'm
creating a weather report.  This magazine has been a
very personal project: to learn more about what's out there,
to be open to more work, and to see if it moves me or doesn't.
The magazine speaks for itself, and I'm lucky to be on the
web and have as much space as I want.

But when the editor of a magazine becomes more important
than the content, watch out.

Thanks to Kasey for his WONDERFUL post on genius.  I'm in complete
agreement so can offer nothing in the way of explication but instead pass
along Corso's complimentary poem, "From Another Room":

FROM ANOTHER ROOM

Dumb genius blows
feeble breath into my windowless room
He -- the sagacious mute
rap-tapping a code or doom
-- the drunkard punched the wall to have his storm!
Through the crack! Through the crack!
My feast was in the easy blood that flowed.


Not a great poem, but a wonderful one.  That first linebreak is a doosy,
and has any every used exclamation points to better comic purpose than
Corso, here and elsewhere ("Dialogue - 2 Dollmakers" for instance)?

Dumb Genius Blows!   -m.

But there just might be people who would enjoy, or at least be relieved,
to be called great.  Why should only sports stars have
halls of fame, and movie stars handprints on Hollywood Blvd.?

The question of how much time it should take properly to evaluate
a poet is an interesting one, though.  It seems to me there are
only two time-bound considerations: (1) how long should it take a
sensitive intelligent auditor to become sufficiently familiar with
a superior poet's work to appreciate it? and (2) how long should it
take for poetry readers to be able to give proper credit to a poet
(by ascertaining who, if anyone, he may have been merely a passive
copier of).  I would guess ten years for (1); perhaps 40 or 50 years
for (2), but only 20 for someone intelligent whose life's work was
the history of poetry and who therefore truly investigated who was
writing what during the given poet's career.

In the case of John M. Bennett, it probably took me four or five years
to begin appreciating his work after I started reading it, and another
two to appreciate it enough to rate him as high as I do.  That's not
ten years, but I had to put in five to ten years with other work to
appreciate poetry like his to be able to even begin appreciating his.
On the other hand, I wasn't concentrating on his work.  Hence, my
(extreme) guess that it took me ten years to go from not being
able to appreciate his work at all to being able to appreciate it
enough to recognize it as first-rate--assuming Bennett was not
simply passively doing spin-offs of some much better poet's work.

I've known his work about fifteen years now, and known the past
thirty years of poetry in English fairly well--well enough to be
pretty sure he's an original, but not positive.

But all is vague.  I can't say I'm as sure of Bennett's greatness
as I am of Wordsworth's.

While in this thread, I have to say I've never read or heard of
a colleciton of poems, every one of which was great!  I think it
would be very hard to make a collection of ANY poet's work with more
than twenty poems in it, all of which were great.

I find "a keen understanding of the marketplace" an interesting term to use.

Are poets a "marketplace" to be "cracked"? Is there a "surface" to be "risen

to"? "Strategy" is more important than "good art"? (I would like to hear

that "convincing argument"...) If someone comes at us with the "right"

publication with the "right" editing, then we, as poetic consumers, will

consume? Maybe we should do a focus group and a market analysis. Poets, get

your credit cards ready!

Sorry it has taken me so long to reply.  Busy busy.  At the risk of stroking
the obvious, let me put it this way.  We live in an age of specialization,
not only in literature but in nearly every field of human endeavor.  Perhaps
it has always been so, since the "beginning," waiting only for the
accumulation of knowledge, i.e., the introduction of difference--something
that must have occurred veerrry early in man's history.  Charles Bernstein's
"Writing and Method," whatever else it intends, serves as an excellent
overview of specialization within the realms of philosophy, literature, and
the systemic power of writing in general.  Authors and editors with a
distinct point of view, an "identity," have a better shot not only at
solidfying an audience base, but at posterity as well.  As far as I can tell,
most of the mags from our past that have stood the test of time-- thus
far--utilized this strategy, at least in their initiation, e.g., BLAST, The
Objectivist, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, various political journals categorized as
liberal, conservative, socialist, etc., etc.  Aesthetics escapes neither
politics nor the marketplace which are always twined together in any event,
and that includes poets, poems, professors, publishers, critics, and all the
rest involved in the intellectual economy, the distribution and preservation
of intellectual product.  Canny specialization makes movement through the
marketplace, any marketplace, that much easier.  None of this diminishes the
love of art, the value of art, the desire to make art of any kind.  Nothing
in my original post suggests it did.  Nor is there any overt suggestion that
I prefer either journals that "gather" (perhaps more democratic), or those
that practice exclusionary tactics for the sake of processing a clear
identity.  It seems clear to me that without specialization, we wouldn't have
19th century British Romanticism, symbolism, impressionism, expressionism,
surrealism, Futurism, Modernism, and on and on.  It is quite possible that we
wouldn't have a literary history at all, at least in the sense of something
that evolves.  Of course if an editor's strong point of view is identical to
that of a hundred other mags so inclined, that probably won't work either.
As for the term "good," unless we're referring to civic virtue which might
evince some objective standard (at least a consensus), the term is awfully
subjective in the area of aesthetics (which creates standards only to break
them, which is "good" in my view).  In art, it is probably true that  the
adjective "good" indicates an objectification only when it is applied to work
that has survived.  ARTWORK-->unique enough to pass the test of time-->GOOD.
That middle part is strategic, if anything is.

As a sloppy Romantic myself, I admire your idealism.  May the texts that are
you and I survive somehow, somewhere.  Best, Bill

CHANGE TO THE SUB VOICIVE PROGRAMME

Lisa Raphals is returning to USA earlier than anticipated and the svp
programme is changing accordingly. The advertised reading by Lisa and Will
Rowe at the beginning of September 2001 will NOT happen; and no svp event is
planned for that day

Lisa Raphals will read on Tuesday 21st August 2001 at Betsey Trotwood public
house in Farringdon Rd, London opposite the Guardian building at 8 pm

It is realised this change may be awkward but please do turn out to support
the series and to see Lisa who is a fascinating writer


POETRY AND MOVEMENT

There is a series of 5 workshops on POETRY AND MOVEMENT at Chisenhale Dance
Space, near Mile End, this autumn - Wednesday evenings on 3 Oct 2001, 10 Oct
2001, 24 Oct 2001, 7 Nov 2001 and 5 December 2001. Times to be announced

Participation in the workshops themselves is by invitation; but others who
wish to attend as audience are more than welcome; and they will also be
welcome to join in the discussions which we hope will follow the workshops
themselves

Those involved include Lawrence Upton, Jennifer Pike and Rory McDermott -
others will be announced when they have confirmed

Some issues we hope to address: visual texts as notation; performance
decision-making; the text as performance environment and the creation and
modification of space by image projection; the performance space as text;
the performing figure as textual element + masks + costume - feedback across
genres; movement implied in still images; gesture as a means of generating
or modifying utterance; movement-utterance feedback / generation. Colour.
Animation.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  A commitment.  I was looking
exactly for speculation, commitment, something.  I am aware of the
conditions under which people place the word "great".  "Great" is ironically
one oppressed word (but perhaps only in these parts).  What I am still most
amazed by is the absolute fear of this by some and the complete and total
rejection of this by others.  Some live in fear and some live in denial.  I
am somewhat ashamed to admit I'm somewhat in fear and somewhat in denial.
Thanks for embracing reality.

Giuliani Wants to End 1st Amend Rights in NYC

by Robert Lederman

On the same day he announced the resumption of toxic
spraying for West Nile Virus, Mayor Giuliani's lawyers
claimed they will attempt to change a fundamental NYC law in
retaliation for street artists winning their second Federal
lawsuit concerning First Amendment rights on NYC streets.

The law in question was passed in 1982 by the NY City
Council granting book vendors, authors and newspaper
publishers an exemption from any licensing or permit
requirement based on the freedom of speech clause in the
U.S. and NY State Constitutions. Two Federal lawsuits,
Lederman et al v City of New York/ Bery et al v City of New
York decided in 1996 and Lederman et al v Giuliani decided
in 2001 [see below] extended the licensing/permit exemption
to street artists.

In order to overcome these Federal rulings the Giuliani
administration would have to convince the NY City Council to
revoke the 1982 law. What this would result in is a complete
elimination of the right to sell, give away or even display
art, books, leaflets and newspapers on the street or within
350' of any park without first obtaining permission from the
Mayor. Even making a speech or holding a protest would
require a permit.

Such a new law could not be applied just to street artists
without violating the 14th Amendments equal protection
clause. Among the changes that would be required to make the
new law pass Constitutional scrutiny would be to apply it to
tens of thousands of newspaper vending boxes that are
located on street corners and around parks throughout the
City.

These steel and plastic boxes represent a substantial part
of the distribution system for the NY Times, Post, Daily
News, Newsday, NY Press, Village Voice, Wall Street Journal
and for more than 20 free community papers. None require a
license, fee or getting permission from the City.

The NYC Department of Parks has already created a law
requiring any gathering of 20 or more persons for whatever
reason to obtain a permit. The law applies to rallies,
discussion groups, sports activities or even a silent prayer
meeting. Not surprisingly, it is selectively enforced, most
usually against activists, teenagers and minority groups.

Media coverage of the street artist ruling follows:

Judge Bars Permit Requirement for Art Vendors

By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN


Photo/Nancy Siesel/The New York Times

Robert Lederman, at the microphone, is among the artists who
sued to challenge the city's rule requiring permits to sell
works outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art.


A federal judge has ruled that the Giuliani administration's
requirement that art vendors in parks have permits is a
violation of the city code, which unconditionally prohibits
mandatory licensing for those who sell art and books.

The decision, issued Aug. 7 by Judge Lawrence M. McKenna of
United States District Court in Manhattan, did not delve
into whether the city's actions violated the artists'
constitutional right to free speech. But in multiple
lawsuits and legal motions that the artists have won in
state and federal courts, they have argued that their rights
to free speech were being restricted.

The decision, which the city vowed yesterday to appeal,
affects street artists who display their work in parks or on
adjacent sidewalks, including those at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, which are part of Central Park. Their legal
battle began in 1998 after the police began issuing
summonses to those without permits. The conflict escalated
into street protests and arrests, and the police confiscated
some artwork.

Yesterday, a group of the artists gathered outside the
Metropolitan Museum to celebrate the decision. Holding an
unflattering painting of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Robert
Lederman, one of the artists, said that the legal victory
protected the rights of everyone from leafleteers to media
magnates whose papers are sold in vending boxes, which
require no permits.

"Our efforts continue to make this city a place where
artists can enjoy the freedom to create, display and sell
their works," he said, "and this most essential of human
freedoms can continue to be enjoyed by all New Yorkers."

The federal decision came on the heels of a state decision
last week that also favored the artists. A state appeals
court affirmed the decision of a judge in State Supreme
Court in Manhattan who dismissed criminal charges against
two artists who were given summonses for selling artwork
without a permit.

The Manhattan district attorney's office has decided to
appeal that decision also, according to city officials. The
officials acknowledged that after the state decision last
week they told the police and the Parks Department, which
has jurisdiction over the space, to stop issuing summonses
to the artists.

Yesterday, city officials characterized the defeats in state
and federal courts as the result of confusion over the
interpretation of the city code. The parks commissioner,
Henry J. Stern, called the case "a highly technical decision
dealing with effect of administrative code on park-related
matters."

But he said that the Parks Department hoped to impose
"reasonable regulations" either through legal remedy or some
amendment to the city code. Currently, he said, "the
unregulated commercial sale of art in public parks is
inappropriate and intrusive."

A lawyer for the city, Robin Binder, said last night, "The
city thinks the decision is wrong and intends to appeal."
The city can appeal to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit and beyond that to the United States
Supreme Court.

Both sides seemed poised for further legal fighting
yesterday. At the Metropolitan Museum, one of the artists,
Wei Zhang, said that he had come from China, a country
without human rights or free speech. After getting here, he
said, the Giuliani administration had him arrested and
confiscated his paintings. "I come to the wrong place
again,' " he said.

The discord began in March 1998, when the city began to try
to regulate the cluster of street artists outside the
Metropolitan Museum and began issuing 24 permits a month -
at $25 each - to those selling their work there. The fine
for those selling works without permits was $1,000.

When the artists organized protests, singing and likening
Mr. Giuliani to a dictator, the police started arresting
them, leading a number of them away in handcuffs. Officials
from the Metropolitan Museum said at the time that they did
not have any complaints with the artists.

The artists organized a group, Artist, an acronym for
Artists' Response to Illegal State Tactics, and demanded
that the state abide by a 1996 federal court decision that
was the first to reject the city's efforts to license
artists. Their protests and the arrests continued, and the
lawsuits began as they fought what they called restrictions
on their freedom.

In August 1998, Judge Lucy Billings of State Supreme Court
in Manhattan dismissed the charges against several of the
artists, ruling that city law prevented the licensing of
book and art vendors. She quoted a 1982 City Council law
that said, "It is consistent with the principles of free
speech and freedom of the press to eliminate as many
restrictions on the vending of written matter as is
consistent with the public health, safety and welfare."

While the city appeals, one of the lawyers for the artists,
Robert Perry, said his clients might go to trial to get
damages for the restriction on their livelihood.

Meanwhile, the artists seemed to be doing a brisk business
selling postcards that depicted Mr. Giuliani in various
monstrous guises.


For Immediate Release

Assignment desk:

Street Artists win Second Federal Lawsuit Against Giuliani;
Parks Department Artist Permit System Ended by Federal
Court; press conference Friday 8/10/2001 12 noon in front of
Metropolitan Museum of Art

Contact# 718 743-3722

Federal Judge Lawrence McKenna has just issued a ruling in
Lederman et al v Giuliani 98 Civ. 2024 (LMM) in favor of the
NYC street artist plaintiffs. "Section 105 (b) 's permit
requirement cannot be enforced against art vendors or indeed
against book vendors", the judge wrote agreeing with both an
earlier ruling by the NY State Appeals Court in a related
case and with the 1996 street artist ruling by the second
circuit Federal Appeals court.

In conversations with the plaintiffs lawyers, Corporation
Counsel Robin Binder acknowledged the termination of the
Parks Department artist permit. Binder also claimed the City
would now seek to change NYC law, specifically the licensing
exemption for First Amendment protected book and newspaper
vendors. Since winning the first street artist lawsuit in
1996 [Lederman et al v City of NY/Bery et al v City of NY]
artists have the same licensing exemption as book and
newspaper vendors.

Eliminating that exemption would mean significant
restrictions on free speech generally and specifically on
tens of thousands of newspaper vending boxes owned by the NY
Times, Post, Daily News, Village Voice and other NYC papers
which are set up without any permit, fee or permission on
NYC streets.

Artists plaintiffs and their attorneys will hold a press
conference outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art Friday
August 10, 2001 at 12 noon. The exact location will be on
the south side of the Met under the shade trees where the
artists display their works.

Note: This is a completely different ruling from the one
announced on 7/31 by the NY State Appeals Court, which also
ruled against the City's artist permit.

A.R.T.I.S.T. president and lead plaintiff Robert Lederman,
who has been arrested more than 40 times for protesting
against the Mayor, made the following statement on winning
the suit:

"We street artists have spent eight years fighting Mayor
Giuliani's efforts to restrict First Amendment freedom. Long
before anyone else was sounding the alarm our message was
that this Mayor had an agenda about limiting freedom of
speech. It's a great feeling to know that our efforts
continue to make this City a place where artists can enjoy
the freedom to create display and sell their works and that
this most essential of human freedoms can continue to be
enjoyed by all New Yorkers".

 Rachel,
 It's great to hear a young woman talking about her
 choices, clear-eyed and confident that she has them.
 You seem puzzled that not all women share your
 perspective, but there are still many, many women for
 whom motherhood IS a means, sometimes the only
 means, to acquire respect, status within the family,
and love.
 Women's issues are never far from class issues, and
 working class women have, to a great extent,lost
 faith in the women's movement for its failure to
respect their needs, especially with regard to
motherhood.
 Silvia Plath was no product of the working class,
 but in her generation those values were still the
 dominant ones in our society and  Sylvia always
wanted lots of approval.
 Some of us actually love children!! We take pleasure
 in being a part of the human-animal  experience of
 parenting, all that messy animal stuff - childbirth,
suckling -and seeing the world anew through the eyes
of
 a child. But all parents confront the inevitable
 limits of parenting whether or not we did it well.
I'm sure everyone knows someone who had great parents
and turned out to be a real ass.
 Likewise,the children, like Robert Stone, who grew
 up on the sreet, child of a schizophrenic mom and
 unknown father, who became remarkable: in Stone's
case, a gift to literature and a good father, friend,
and husband.
 Parenthood is a crap shoot. But for some of us, it
 has immeasurably expanded our knowledge of what it
means to be human. I wouldn't have missed it for the
world.

I just saw a documentary at the Providence, Rhode
Island film festival about Cynthia Plaster Caster and
much was made of Jimi Hendrix's, uh, plaster cast.
Pretty funny movie, and it also sparked a lot of
debate between me and my movie-going companion and
erstwhile sig oth about whether or not what Cynthia
did/does can be seen as a feminist act.  I held that
because she lives her life so much on her own terms,
and because by asking men who do not work in the sex
industry to hold their erections long enough for her
to dip them in a cold plaster mixture so she can make
a cast, which she then owns as art, she causes these
men to confront their own issues around masculinity
and their power as rock stars, she is indeed doing
something that could be called feminist.  But she's
also, at heart, a groupie (albeit an artist-groupie),
and does this superceed any power she had within her
relationships with rock stars?

Ok, sorry, digression.  If anyone else has seen this
film, or has any good sources about the whole groupie
subculture they can point me towards, I'd love to talk
about it.  Please backchannel.


Thanks,
Arielle

PS No one in the film could measure up to Jimi.

This Aguilera person is a woman of colour? I didnt know that. I have
just seen pictures of her in magazines and heard what seemed to be a
rock viseo on TV. My point,  was not to ridicule a kids' rock idol,
but to make a point about greatness and fashionable fame. If you
could supply me with the name of a man with no colour who is also
very popular with the kids but whose talent may not  yet have assured
immortality, I will be pleased to use that fellow's name rather than
Miss Aguilera's.

By the way, I am having trouble with the phrase, "source of your
ridicule." If indeed, I were doing some ridiculing, I would have had
to say that I was the source of the ridicule, and that he person
mentioned was the target of the ridicule.

Dear Laurie,
Thanks for the response, though to tell you the truth I found it a bit
condescending, if not platitudinous, and not responsive to the issue that I
was talking about, though I see now that was my fault because i wasn't clear
and descriptive enough and that you were trying to be kind.

What I am talking about women of a certain age, 35 - 40 who seem to get here
(as I said, it is where I am) and face some sort of abyss, and though in a
way post 60's and 70's life promised more choices, there only seems to be
one.  The issue of respect from the culture is complex, anyone who grows up
in a household with a mother knows what the true dynamics of motherhood are
for that household, whether it be working class, single mother, brut father,
or perfection?--and so when I say that it can't just be for respect (I think
of the women schlepping their baby carriages up and down the subway, and
yes, folks are nice, but mostly to be a mother in my city it is
gruelling--not to mention the absolute separation of societies with children
and societies without them) I mean to say that I am searching for a key to
what i am anecdotally observing as a  _movement_ towards motherhood, from
this specific demographic group at this specific time, all the more
remarkable because these are activists, feminists, lesbians, single working
women, women of working class, and middle class, itinerant women,
"diagnosed" women, women whose lives are disgustinly well-organized, women
who get fired a lot from their jobs--most of my people are women who ten
years ago were getting arrested for civil disobedience or twenty years ago
resemble roller girl in boogie nights.

How is this poetics?
I'll let y'all decide.
kiss,
Rachel

 Rachel,
 It's great to hear a young woman talking about her
 choices, clear-eyed and confident that she has them.
 You seem puzzled that not all women share your
 perspective, but there are still many, many women for
 whom motherhood IS a means, sometimes the only
 means, to acquire respect, status within the family,
and love.
 Women's issues are never far from class issues, and
 working class women have, to a great extent,lost
 faith in the women's movement for its failure to
respect their needs, especially with regard to
motherhood.
 Silvia Plath was no product of the working class,
 but in her generation those values were still the
 dominant ones in our society and  Sylvia always
wanted lots of approval.
 Some of us actually love children!! We take pleasure
 in being a part of the human-animal  experience of
 parenting, all that messy animal stuff - childbirth,
suckling -and seeing the world anew through the eyes
of
 a child. But all parents confront the inevitable
 limits of parenting whether or not we did it well.
I'm sure everyone knows someone who had great parents
and turned out to be a real ass.
 Likewise,the children, like Robert Stone, who grew
 up on the sreet, child of a schizophrenic mom and
 unknown father, who became remarkable: in Stone's
case, a gift to literature and a good father, friend,
and husband.
 Parenthood is a crap shoot. But for some of us, it
 has immeasurably expanded our knowledge of what it
means to be human. I wouldn't have missed it for the
world.
Laurie

Thanks Maria,
thought so. Did you read "The Scapegoat?" then i must say, i found it
suspicious his use of an anti-Semitic persecution tale by Guillaume de
MAchaut as the opening of the book, which he seems to almost gratuitously
refer to occasionally through the first half of the text as the pinacle
example of his theory of scapegoat and persecution, then forgets about it as
soon as he established that the disciples and the gospels birthed the
language that will save the world.  I liked a lot of the writing in this
book, but this not only bothered me as an apparent trick, but he never
showed how the Machaut story fit his model of Crises-persecution of
scapegoat-rise to level of a god-resumption of norm.  Anyway, I'd love more
info.
--RAchel

Subject:      Artdealer Fable 1920
In-Reply-To:  <NDBBIDOHCLLJAFADMHABAEALDGAA.patrick@proximate.org>

The year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for
American art dealers. Big buyers -- the robber-baron
generation of the previous century -- were getting to an age
where they were dying off like flies, and no new
millionaires had emerged to take their place. Things were so
bad that a number of the major dealers decided to pool their
resources, an unheard-of event, since art dealers usually
get along like cats and dogs. Joseph Duveen, art dealer to
the richest tycoons of America, was suffering more than the
others that year, so he decided to go along with this
alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest
dealers in the country. Looking around for a new client,
they decided that their last best hope was Henry Ford, then
the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture into
the art market, and he was such a big target that it made
sense for them to work together. The dealers decided to
assemble a list, "The 100 Greatest Paintings in the World"
(all of which they happened to have in stock), and to offer
the lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make
himself the world's greatest collector. The consortium
worked for weeks to produce a magnificent object: a
three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions
of the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying
each picture. Next they made a personal visit to Ford at his
home in Dearborn, Michigan. There they were surprised by the
simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was obviously an extremely
unaffected man. Ford received them in his study. Looking
through the book, he expressed astonishment and delight. The
excited dealers began imagining the millions of dollars that
would shortly flow into their coffers. Finally, however,
Ford looked up from the book and said, "Gentlemen, beautiful
books like these, with beautiful colored pictures like
these, must cost an awful lot!" "But Mr Ford!" exclaimed
Duveen, "we don't expect you to _buy these books. We got
them up especially for you, to show you the pictures. These
books are a present to you." Ford seemed puzzled.
"Gentlemen," he said, "it is extremely nice of you, but I
really don't see how I can accept a beautiful, expensive
present like this from strangers." Duveen explained to Ford
that the reproductions in the books showed paintings they
had hoped to sell to him. Ford finally understood. "But
gentlemen," he exclaimed, "what would I want with the
original pictures when the ones right here in these books
are so beautiful?"

David: thanks for your praise--glad to know the book is "better than
nothing".  I have heard that there is even social class in Kansas.  And I
know that all representations are also from another point of view
misrepresentations.  Unless of course the other point of view is yours or
Andrew Duncan's.

Hey.  It's never fun sending a rejection letter.  When I started editing
Samizdat, I used to write out page-long letters, and try to say something
specific about the poems and why we weren't going to publish them.  When I
started getting page-long letters back, telling me how wrong I was, I went
over to the more usual model of rejection slip.  (What was it -- Kayak? --
that used to send out little cards with a picture of the guillutine?  That
was probably out of line -- not everyone has a sense of humor).

Anyway -- a magazine like Samizdat, which doesn't list any address to which
poems should be sent, and which officially doesn't take unsolicited
manuscripts, gets unsolicited contributions in the mail every day.  There's
not enough space even to print the poems about which I'm enthusiastic.  I
have a lot of sympathy for the people who are rejected, I take no relish in
it, and I seriously doubt that many editors do.  Editing has its rewards, but
rejecting work is not one of them.

Arielle,

I have an article about CPC in the latest issue of Nest, a glitzy
magazine "of interiors."  My 1000 word article is accompanied with
photos of Cynthia's Chicago apartment, which, I imagine you saw lots
of in the film.  I haven't seen the documentary.  When I talked with
Cynthia, they were submitting it to film festivals.  It apparently
didn't make it into the bay area festivals, as I haven't heard of it
being shown out here.

I did buy a bootleg copy of the 1969 documentary The Groupies--off of
eBay, of course.  I'd seen it when I was an undergrad and it had made
quite an impression on me.  The movie is long out of circulation and
my copy was so many levels beyond the original that sometimes it was
just a smear of color across the screen, hard to see the action.  In
some ways this was enjoyable.

There's lots about groupies on the internet.  Just do a search on
Cynthia--there's a couple of groupies websites.

I, personally, wasn't all that impressed with Cynthia's project.
Everything about her seemed so showman-like and well rehearsed.
Before I talked to her I'd read several interviews published on the
web, and her answers to my questions were nearly verbatim what I'd
read.  And she kept saying things that were geared to shock me, like
"I like to talk dick."  I don't really think there is a feminist
politics behind her project--not that that really matters.  Why does
a woman need to have a feminist agenda to deal with sex--I don't see
any reason for that.

When I was working on the piece my editor was visiting SF and we went
out to dinner.  He asked me what I thought of Cynthia's project, and
I said I thought it was revolting, but I wasn't going to write from
that perspective.  He said, "You're right, that's not the most
interesting perspective."  He suggested I focus on technical
expertise, which I did do.  It was a difficult project for me, as I
wanted to be honest.  I didn't like the project but I liked Cynthia
and didn't want to say anything bad about her--plus it was clear I
was being paid (a lot) to act enthusiastic about the project.  I
ended up being pleased with what I'd done.  I thought--there's worst
ways to be a whore (meaning me, not Cynthia).

Best,
Dodie

I have the opportunity to gradually attempt to establish some sort of poetry
residency, conference, or short intensive workshop, probably with a focus on
ecopoetics, in Joshua Tree National Park (the Mojave Desert not very far
from Palm Springs or Riverside).

It has always seemed to me that fewer of these types of opportunities are
available to more experimental poets.

What would draw you to such a residency, conference, or short intensive
workshop?  College credit?  Opportunity to present a paper, a panel, read to
some sand?  Is the only reason to go to one of these things to study with
[famous poet]?  Is there really usually a lot of money involved somehow?  Is
time alone in an old ranger cabin much more useful than time alone at home?
Are you willing to camp?

Thanks in advance,

Jim--I would imagine most editors start up a magazine because they want to
publish work they're enthusiastic about.  I'm not sure I understand why it's
culpable of them thus not to publish work they have no enthusiasm for.

Glad for Robert Archambeau's pointer to his editorial on anthologies, though
I might demur a bit at a few things.  First, because rejection is not the
same as omission: the former is the province of a magazine editor, the
latter of an anthology editor (that is, most anthologies contain reprinted
work selected by the editor at leisure from a poet's oeuvre, while the
editor of a magazine has no control over the quality of hitherto unseen
submissions).  Second, the Ellmann/O'Clair Norton anthology is hardly
unedited or indiscriminate...as a comparison with the Hoover anthology might
suggest, considering the virtual nonoverlap between the two.  Third, there
are good reasons for including in anthologies work the editor may not
like--as I once remarked I think Spenser's _Shepherd's Calendar_ is awful
but if I were editing an anthology of Renaissance verse it would be in
there.  Little magazines respond to entirely different imperatives.

all best --N

Twould be hard to disagree with that. I figure that if you think that
your own life is yours to do with as you want to, you have a tight
egotism that is not open to hearing anything that is beyond what one

Hi Ben,

John Godfrey is a wonderful poet and full-time, probably more than
full-time, nurse. I don't know a whole lot about him, though my sense is
he's in his fifties, has lived all or most of his life on the east coast,
has been involved with the Poetry Project some. I see him now & then in the
east village, where he lives. If you live in New York, you can probably see
him read here sometime, though he doesn't read all that often, maybe once a
year or two years or so. The people I know who know him say he's as
intensely dedicated a nurse as he is a poet.

There's a new book out by him that I think was published by The Figures (or
Hard Press, or maybe a collaborative publication?), but I don't know the
name of it. The Figures published Midnight on Your Left in 1988, which I'm
pretty sure is still in print--& at $6, a real bargain.

The Figures, 5 Castle Hill, Great Barrington, MA 01230. The editor's name is
Geoffrey Young, who will happily tell you everything he knows about Godfrey
if you ask him.

You might also try checking out:

www.abebooks.com

which is a vast database/website for used books, where you can search for
John Godfrey, and probably find some of his earlier books.

Dabble and Where the Weather Suits My Clothes are two other Godfrey titles,
though both probably out of print. You might find used copies of both (&
maybe some of Godfrey's even early stuff) at abebooks. Both are worth
having, especially Dabble, which I think is a kind of selected of early
poems, very different than Midnight on Your Left.

I think there was an interview with Godfrey in the Poetry Project Newsletter
a few years ago. You might also try writing to them and seeing if you can
get that issue. I don't know their full address offhand, but you can find
them online, just type in "Poetry Project" in Google or Yahoo.

I don't know of anything written about his work, though. If you find
anything, divulge!

Gary

I don’t know if it’s fair or not to throw this into the mix, but my own
favorite poetics magazine is Jonas Mekas’s Film Culture.

I think of it as a poetics magazine, in part because Mekas is a poet & has a
poet’s sensibility (as opposed I guess to a narrative-maker’s), and in part
because the magazine mostly seems to me to be advocating a kind of "poetics
of cinema."

It, and Mekas, had an amazing history.

The first issue came out in the 50s, and they’re still publishing, if very
irregularly. When Mekas started the magazine, not long after he’d arrived in
the USA with his brother, Adolfas, after spending years in an internment
camp in eastern Europe after the second world war, he was what you’d call
more or less a "conservative." In 1955 he wrote a piece for Film Culture
called "The Experimental Film in America," which criticized American
avant-garde filmmakers for being "adolescent," lacking in creativity ... and
even included a section titled "The Conspiracy of Homosexuality."

The essay is actually still in print, in P. Adams Sitney’s Film Culture
Reader. There is now, though, a note from Mekas: "What amazes me when
re-reading (in 1970) this Saint-Augustine-before-the-conversion piece, is
not the complete turnabout that I have traveled since then, but the fact
that the tone, the thinking, and the argumentation of my essay of fifteen
years ago are still used today by all the liberal and conservative critics
to put down the avant-garde film-maker of 1970." It’s amazing to me that
Mekas continues to allow this piece of his to see print (is there any poet
or poetry critic who’s allowed anything similar?) – but he does, and I think
he does because for him, the progress of the magazine, & of his own
thinking, whatever happened historically, is more important to him than
saving face. (Obviously, Mekas overcame his homophobia; he just never tried
to hide the fact that he’d once suffered from it.)

Film Culture is without question the single most important English-language
magazine devoted to the art, ultimately the most "liberal," the broadest in
scope, the loosest, the most inclusive, and of those in English, probably
the only one that’s going to be remembered for any length of time. (Ron, if
you can tell me a single American poetics mag that has been as influential &
important for poets as FC has been for filmmakers "across the board," & I’ll
accept a convincing argument, I’ll give you five US bucks. I have to be
honest: what I finally don’t "get" is why anyone would believe some US
poetry mag fueled on mere polemics that runs for less than a dozen issues is
even in the same league as Film Culture.) Millennium Film Journal, Film
Comment, etc., are all wonderful, but Film Culture is indispensable. It’s
neither about the filmmaker’s twelve close friends & their "new film
movement," nor is it some hodge-podge of avant-garde & mainstream film.

It really has, for half a century, been a kind of weathervane, in that it
has always reflected not only the editor’s point of view, but its readers’ &
contributors’ – it’s filled with dissenting opinion.  (For instance, Andrew
Sarris, with whom Mekas almost always completely disagrees, is one of the
most prominent frequent contributors.)

I love this magazine, I love the sense it actually gives of the film world,
specifically the avant-garde film world, as it existed & exists (as opposed
to how one might idealize it), and it’s a constant source of sadness (&
minor embarrassment) that nothing like it in the poetry world, at least not
in English, has ever been made manifest.

Why not?

Gary

Alan. I am always surprised by your ongoing "magnus opus" and pleased you
are putting your work and self on the line on line so to speak. How to
evaluate it? Need to enavaluate it? Enough that I find it always
interesting - sometimes annoying - sometimes not so good but mostly
fascinating. The idea and the "audacity" of the quantity of it at the very

hi jim

due to wierd circumstances beyond my control (email forwarded from host
i can't get onto anymore because my hub got decomissioned, but it's
memory was downloaded into another server) i GET buffalo list but
can't write to it.  i'd love not to get it at my present site, but
somewhere with a decent mail editor... i've been thinking of looking
into hotmail.  anyway, don't read much of it because mail editor
makes that impossible.  BUT...

have been following your edit post a bit.  you are, as always, cogent
and thoughtful, good points.  i agree with the drift of your riposte
to david baratier, but he IS making a useful point which, as an editor,
you have at least grappled with.  what do you do when a well known
writer sends you something dreadful?  it is a variation of your dilemna
when a friend sends something dreadful.  you have reasons to say yes,
and reasons to say no.

it is an interesting question.  one thinks of an editor as deciding from
an ivory tower of purist theory, but the visigoths scale the tower in
hordes.  there is no purist theory country you can live in that has no
ladders.

it is good to put your emphasis on what you can include, where you can
say yes, who you have supported.  to say each no with regret and a
wish things had been different, with hope that you won't have to say
no to the same person in the future, makes for a more
collegial, encouraging atmosphere.

but, as in life, there are people who draw definition, power, out of
who they turn down, who they snub, and that isn't meant as a bad
thing.  saying no, as sartre would have it, can ultimately be the only
proof of existence, the last refuge of the beleaguered.  emphasis on
being able to say no, then, interestingly, can signal a sense of
powerlessness, a retreat into the last power, choice, of even the most
disenfranchised...

and an emphasis on yes, on wishing to say yes, can be a position of
strength, of a mindset of optimism that everyone has at least one good
poem in them, that people and their writing evolve, that nothing is
static.

anyway, you can post this if you want...

one might say, hysterically catholic.  for a truly strange reading
experience (assuming you are more skeptical than he is), read "Things
Hidden Since the Foundation of the World"--though it is one of the truly
great examples of someone simply ignoring or rejecting counterevidence in
order to make argument.  as I recall, he simply rejects the parts of the
Bible that seemingly contradict him.  it's much more pleasing to apply the
strictures he does to other religions back to X-tianity:  after all, this
is a religion where the Savior's blood is drunk every week (at least after
transubstantiation, which may or may not be still Vatican policy--I'm not
up these things).  that said, he is much more interesting on literature:
check out Deceit, Desire and the Novel.

Allusion well taken.

My objection would be lifting a discreet historical moment to the level of a
discreet yet ahistorical genre.  Even with the given difficulty of
discretion in such cases, I stand behind any attempt to develop work (be it
Kenning or a pop group) stemming from developments supposedly run-the-course
such as radical modernist poetry or punk rock music.

I suppose if I'm young (30, to be exact), and "post-Language" (which, in my
day to day living / working, makes little sense to me, as much as whatever
it is may bear on my circumstances or judgment), then so be it.  In fact,
that was the explicit conditions of my early editor's notes in which I lay
out my field of intention in terms of Kenning, if nothing else.  Can't tell
what to make of the tenor of your post, but I certainly don't feel in the
least that Kenning has been or will become a damned proposition.  In fact,
due entirely to the devotion and ingenuity of my contributors (young & old),
I consider Kenning to have been a great success on its own terms, thusfar.
My only regret is that "young" and "post-Language" too easily become tags
which, once spotted, keep the more timid of Kenning's potential audience at
bay.  And so, they spend their hard-earned six bucks on a copy of The germ,
instead of twelve for one of each.

Rad.  The mosh pit was invented in a frat house.

Patrick Durgin, editor of Kenning, said, in response to my mention of my son
and his friends starting a punk band:

"No, they're not. With the wealth of edutainment pieces now available on the
(more or less) simulataneous socio-political phenomena of punk, more and
more kids are figuring out what a damned proposition "starting a punk rock
band" is."

This is interesting (I take it Durgin is alluding to cultural field theory
and the folly of position-taking gestures in an ideologically overdetermined
and appropriated field)...

Could it be said, too, that in the more or less simultaneous socio-political
phenomena of "avant-garde"/experimental writing, that young, post-Language

I guess you could say that I have a knee-jerk reaction to anything
resembling a capitalist-consumer-production process when applied to poetry.
To me, part of the art & publishing of poetry is presenting an alternative
to current systems, or, as Thoreau put it (I'm paraphrasing), we should let
our poetry be an obstacle to the giant wheel of "progress." While it would
certainly be nice to have some benevolent patron out there pay us for all
the time we spend on poetry and publishing, with no demands on what we
produce, the spiritual costs are too high, generally, for producing work to
"sell." You enter the system. That so many people on this list publish for
the pure love of it presents an important opposition to the current general
consumer-tied mode of publishing. I currently work in the magazine industry,
and believe you me, editorial content is very much affected by advertising,
circulation and consumption.

Also, I very strongly disagree with "good" artwork as that which has stood
the test of time. This idea has been used to justify the existence of the
current white-male-dominated canon. Many poets have recently been
"rediscovered" who were lost for various reasons--racism, sexism, publishers
going out of business, current events, etc. John Donne was only rediscovered
by T.S. Eliot in the early 20th century. And as another example, Elizabeth
Stoddard's novel, The Mogensons, was published just as the Civil War broke
out; as a result, the novel was lost for decades, and is only being
rediscovered now--or at least was rediscovered by an English teacher of
mine. Also, I can think of a few authors who "survived the test of time" who
didn't really deserve to.

Dear Administrators,

I'm a member of the list, but one with problems posting due to multiple
addresses on my messages as they emerge from UNH's server.  Would you
please poet this call from my colleague, as well as another one that I'll
send in just a few moments?  I'm sure they'll be of interest to members of
the list.

Very best wishes and thanks,

Performance Research
'Translations'
Vol.7 No.2 (Summer) 2002

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

'Translations' will be Volume 7, Issue 2 of 'Performance Research' and =
will be jointly edited by Ric Allsopp and guest editor Caroline Bergvall.

Deadlines are as follows:

Proposals                 15th September
Finalised Copy          15th November 2001
Publication Date        June 2002

'Translations will be the second issue of a volume on 'Textualities:
scores, documents and archives (PR Vol.7, Nos 1-4, 2002) which considers
the changing nature of performance texts and relations between writing,
textuality and performance in four related issues: On Editing,
Translations, On Fluxus and On Archives and Archiving.

'Translations' (PR, Vol.7, No.2) considers the role of translation in =
the transmission of languages, texts and performance, a role which is both
complex and paradoxical. Translation is traditionally associated with
questions of monolingualism, national identity and literary heritage =
rather than with questions of exchange and shared influence. Translators
are = often seen as subservient and invisible mouthpieces. Yet at the
heart of translation is an operation of double vision. The translator is
located in-between languages and is caught up in the messy and punctual
business = of handling language and cultural difference. Incompatible and
non-translatable details are just as crucial as assimilable elements.
Translation asks for a reassessment of the way we view and interpret
cultural differences, verbal and performative materials.

The editors invite contributions that explore the notion of traffic and
exchange between cultures, between languages, between media. =
Translations of performance, language and the transformative body,
experimental = literary translations, plurilingual and multivocal pieces,
code switching, new literacies, work which is concerned with erasure,
appropriation or dissimulation, are all areas for consideration.

We are interested in proposals for visual and textual work that makes =
use of the resources of the pages, and in work that may use several
versions = of a text. We are interested in scores and other performance
documents, interviews, discussions, proposals for review essays of
performance, digital, time-based work and books, and in collaborations
between = artists and critics.

The issue will be co-edited by Ric Allsopp, one of the three editors of
Performance Research, and Caroline Bergvall - a practicing writer who =
has published works and collaborated on mixed-media pieces that explore =
notions of locatedness, language use and bilingual circumstances. Most
recently, 'Goan Atom'. Her critical work is similarly concerned with
contemporary translation and plurilingual identities. Caroline Bergvall is
Associate Fellow at Dartington College of Arts (England).

Potential contributors are invited to discuss their ideas in advance of
submission with the editors by email: (Caroline Bergvall)
<c.bergvall@btinternet.com>  or  (Ric Allsopp) <transomatic@orange.net>.

We actively welcome submissions on ANY area of performance research,
practice and scholarship. Proposals and articles will be accepted on
hardcopy, disk or by e-mail and should be sent to:

Performance Research
c/o Dartington College of Arts
Totnes
Devon TQ9 6EJ  UK
email: <performance-research@dartington.ac.uk>

Submission of an article to the journal will be taken to imply that is
presents original, unpublished work not under consideration for =
publication elsewhere. By submitting a manuscript, the authors agree that
the = exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the article have been
given to the publishers (Taylor & Francis / Routledge).

Hey Rachel---

There's at least one great poem in Dorothy Trujillo Lusk's new
OGRESSE OBLIGE that deals with the prejudices she felt were hurled at her
by the enlightened "alternative" scene for choosing to have a child....
at least that's how i read it....

George,

Think of the source as the deep image behind your statement.  While
we're on the topic--in my poetry workshop this summer everyone
admitted that they couldn't really understand what deep image meant
re: poetry.  It was one of those big confessional moments that bonded
everybody.

Since you're so word-wise, can you explain it?

Thanks.

Patrick Durgin, editor of Kenning, said, in response to my mention of my son and his friends starting a punk band:

"No, they're not. With the wealth of edutainment pieces now available on the (more or less) simulataneous socio-political phenomena of punk, more and more kids are figuring out what a damned proposition "starting a punk rock band" is."

This is interesting (I take it Durgin is alluding to cultural field theory and the folly of position-taking gestures in an ideologically overdetermined and appropriated field)...

Could it be said, too, that in the more or less simultaneous socio-political phenomena of "avant-garde"/experimental writing, that young, post-Language editors are beginning to realize what a damn proposition they have gotten themselves into by starting a "radical" literary magazine?

Hi Everybody,

Those of you with access to the Bay Guardian, check out the latest
issue--page 37-38.  There's a sizeable article about Kevin Killian's
new Krupskya book, Argento Series.  The article is half interview,
half--what?  Tribute?  Discussion?

Those of you who don't live in the Bay Area--let me
contextualize--one hardly ever sees any reference to the local poetry
scene in the media, so this is an astonishing manifestation.

Domesticity

Im in the pantry
just off the kitchen
getting a cup of rice
my wife and her sister
are sitting at the
kitchen table
looking at snapshots
talking about cats
not just any cats
cute little kittens
I set aside the
measuring cup
my hands
fly to my head
pressing my temples
there among the
jars and cans
was that me
in that whorehouse?
was that me
crashing that motorcycle?
was that me
sniffing those
amyl nitrates?
was that me
in the slammer
with my pants pissed full?
was that me
and my buddy
drinking beer
snorting coke
and getting blow jobs
while watching
Ironsides on TV?
cute little kittens
I pick up the cup
dip it in the
big bag of rice
hear the dry rustle
of the grains
check the measure
against the light.

a point of emphasis here, I meant the book is _a lot_ better than nothing,
the work you've both done is worthy of respect and praise, but I also thank
you for your 'misrepresentation' of whatever it is you imagine my views to

And so Henry Ford, the wealthiest American in 1920, took the million of
dollars he could have spent on purchasing the art works and sent the money
instead to Adolf Hitler, who then organized the Nazi party and aped Ford's
own anti-Semitic political ideology
(http://www.flinet.com/~politics/antisemi/internat_jew.html) in writing
_Mein Kampf_.  Then with Ford's money, money not spent on art work, Adolf
built a war machine with retooled German Ford plants, slaughtered European
Jews left and right & pillaged the face of Europe with materiel produced at
Ford's plants with Jewish slave labor
(http://usis.kappa.ro/USIS/Washington-File/500/98-12-04/eur504.htm), and
stole the art work represented in Ford's book.  Ford was then able to
purchase the art work at a deep discount, and  was awarded the highest Nazi
civilian medal for his contributions to the Nazi state.  Afterwards Ford
promptly fell asleep in his modest easy chair
(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm).

And so Ford asked himself, "Can I make even more money with my interests in
anti-Semitism, art, and Nazi Germany?"   And so the US went to war with
Germany.  And then the American tax payers shelled out millions of dollars
to pay Ford for war materiel, which were then used to blow up German Ford
plants.  And then the US Government via tax dollars from American pockets
compensated Ford for the loss of their German plants at rates far higher
than the value of the plants.  And so Ford was able to make even more money,
help "answer the Jewish Question," and get his art for cheap.  The art work
was never traced back to Ford.  And so Henry Ford Lived Happily Ever After.


Best,
Patrick


Sorry Brad, no offense meant towards you; I'm not trying to dis you in the
least.  It's just that Henry Ford is just about as infamous a character as
they get.  The realities make a strange ending to this parable, don't they?

I've a lot of sympathy for what is being said here but the above statement
is just not true: Donne always retained a certain 'currency', Coleridge for
instance was well aware of him, and from about the 1890's on he was creeping
back into fashion. I'm sure for instance people like Herbert Grierson were
just as much respomsible for his 're-promotion' as TSE.

An editor is one voice in
the vacuum. So, is a magazine
about an editor and editor's
enthusiasms? Is it really about
"the editor?" Or about contributors,
poems, readers.

To readers, whatever an editor
thinks is "consistently good,
consistently wonderful" could
be seriously less so.  Readers
separate vanity projects from
important literary contributions.

You may believe your magazine
is perfectly wonderful and the
last word on poetry, you may think
you are doing everything the
"essential" way.

I reject that there is any one
"essential" way to run this
enterprise.  People are free
to read or not to read my
magazine, they will decide
whether it matters or what
I do "counts" as editing.

I challenge magazine editors
to challenge themselves--
advocate more work, open
your mind and magazine to
new kinds of poems, because,
fuck YES, you are culpable,
as I am, for the work we turn
away.

Glad for Robert Archambeau's pointer to his editorial on anthologies, though
I might demur a bit at a few things.  First, because rejection is not the
same as omission: the former is the province of a magazine editor, the
latter of an anthology editor (that is, most anthologies contain reprinted
work selected by the editor at leisure from a poet's oeuvre, while the
editor of a magazine has no control over the quality of hitherto unseen
submissions).  Second, the Ellmann/O'Clair Norton anthology is hardly
unedited or indiscriminate...as a comparison with the Hoover anthology might
suggest, considering the virtual nonoverlap between the two.  Third, there
are good reasons for including in anthologies work the editor may not
like--as I once remarked I think Spenser's _Shepherd's Calendar_ is awful
but if I were editing an anthology of Renaissance verse it would be in
there.  Little magazines respond to entirely different imperatives.

Oh, God, Dodie. Remember back in the sixties when Rothenberg and
Kelly and Schwerner were trying to tell us about it? It just drove me
crazy; I think I kind of just glazed over because at the time i didnt
want to have anything to do with deep. i mean I didnt want any Freud,
and i didnt want any avoiding the damned surface of the text, etc. I
wonder whether there has ever been anyone who could explain it.

Goerge. I think neither of us would encourage or talk in ways that
"glorified" suicide. But there is this: neither of us has actually been "in
that space" in our heads so to speak, where we actually go from that or thru
that state to taking our own lives. Love and fear - healthy life or live
loving fear keep us from suicide.
  On the face of it, Plath's situation is not the sort that one would think
"justified" suicide. And some of the people she associated with didnt help -
or did they - I dont think that Lowell and even Hughes or Alvarez did Plath
much good.  It can be very horrible alone with children, the one person one
loves highly having (you feel) abandoned YOU (I mean one  - not you George)
...and I suppose the fact that she did commit suicide shows the loneliness
coupled with the antidpressants
she was taking (that hadnt began to be effective) are reasons. One could
build a University course around suicide its causes, the rights and wrongs.
I''m 53, have "acheived" far less, feel like death every morning, am over
weight, and the very dogs do bark at me as I descant: yet like the doctor in
the story about the storm at sea in the Sommerset Maugham story (when he,
the old doctor, is amazed that the young man with all to lose is revelling
in the storm while he with less life is terrified!), get up, grimace at my
own image, read eg now I finally began Perec's "Life, A User's Manual", (I
like Perec, a humorous and  cunning fellow), stagger to the bathroom, eat a
grapefruit, look at the ugly face in the mirror..talk to my cat that is
always nearly killing me by tripping me up, then burst into crazy song for
no one to hear!
  This "issue" obsseses me as I came close myself and also my son lost his
eye courtesy of the NZ Police and also we have a high youth suicide rate in
"Lovely GREEN LITTLE OLD NEW ZEALAND..." get THAT bullshit propaganda out of
you're mind if its there this place is a madhouse! Read some NZ Lit and some
poetry even by the Curnows (Wystan and Alan) and Alan Loney, or Michelle
Leggott (although her work has despite the tragedy of her gradual loss of
sight has a joie de vivre and Wystan's "Cancer Diary" is strong I'd say) or
my friend Scott Hamilton or Hamish Dewe or Jack Ross or Michael Arnold to
DISPEL THAT STUPID CRAP the NZ TRAVEL BASTARDS PROPOGATE: daily it's a
struggle. Mein Kampf  Our Kampf: not of Hitlers but humans.  But how do
tyrants become so: suicides become so? How? NZ has its share of the dark AND
the light.
   Maybe we suffer from being too aware: too intelligent, even the most
"stupid" of us...60 million years of dinosaurs that didnt even need
intelligence! What's God playing at if he's there!Gott: thou art a loon! A
black loon. A malevolent Laocoon...No: think cheerful thoughts Richard.
Cheers to all, Richard.

I certainly agree with your second sentence.  But this is a moral argument
and not an aesthetic one, unless we believe that only good people make good
art, or that art that survives through a corrupt system is de facto bad art.

If they were rediscovered and preserved, then they passed the test, right?
Like a student who rarely shows up for class but still aces the exams.  I
also am of the opinion that certain members of the "canon" don't belong
there.  But that's my point.  It's only my opinion.  How can we define "good"
beyond an expression of personal preference.  The test of time no doubt
involves dirty business, but it's still objective in the sense that for some
reason or other, certain texts survived.

Take care, Bill

"? was that me crashing that motorcycle? was that me sniffing those amyl
nitrates? "

Nice post -- I really enjoyed it -- but

        no, please: it's amyl nitrite, not amyl nitrate.

I grew up on a farm and I dread to think what amyl nitrates -- if they
exist -- would do to you -- surely they must be some kind of guan0-derived
fertilizer, crudely refined from sex-crazed fruit bat excreta? What happens
if you inhale that stuff? Is there a chemist in the house?

I guess you could say that I have a knee-jerk reaction to anything
resembling a capitalist-consumer-production process when applied to poetry.
To me, part of the art & publishing of poetry is presenting an alternative
to current systems, or, as Thoreau put it (I'm paraphrasing), we should let
our poetry be an obstacle to the giant wheel of "progress." While it would
certainly be nice to have some benevolent patron out there pay us for all
the time we spend on poetry and publishing, with no demands on what we
produce, the spiritual costs are too high, generally, for producing work to
"sell." You enter the system. That so many people on this list publish for
the pure love of it presents an important opposition to the current general
consumer-tied mode of publishing. I currently work in the magazine industry,
and believe you me, editorial content is very much affected by advertising,
circulation and consumption.

Dear Colleagues:

If enrollments are reached, I'll be teaching the following two courses this Fall at West Los Angeles
College:

English 127: Creative Writing

English 211: Fiction.

The Fiction will be an introductory survey of short and long prose works, wildly varied in scope.
The Creative Writing will be an introductory workshop covering poetry, prose and drama. These are
credit courses and transfer as such to the UC and Cal State systems. Three units each.

If you know of anyone who might be interested, I encourage you to pass along this information.
Classes begin August 27th, but students can register before, during and sometimes after that date.
Better to get in early, though. Also, I know that many of us here have very good ideas on the
teaching of these subjects. Anyone who would like to make suggestions should feel free to b/c me.

Thank you.

Dear Dodie,

Very interesting stuff you had to say, and I will
definitely check out your piece.

It was hard to tell from the documentary whether the
work itself was interesting at all, but the film did
show some castings taking place and THAT, the process,
was very interesting, because of the way the men
reacted (often with a lot of
shame/terror/guilt/arousal -- a wide mix of emotions
but it was an obviously  intense moment for them).
I'm not feeling articulate enough (I just got out of
my last day of teaching an 8-hour a day course) to
really explain why I think that was so interesting,
but I did.
The work itself seemed much less so.

In the film, Cynthia came off as really sweet and in
some ways kind of wholesome, I thought...despite
herself.

And sorry if you got the impression that I think
women's art -- sexual or not -- has to be feminist.  I
absolutely don't.  I brought it up somewhat out of
context, because I neglected to mention that in the
film they have Camille Paglia come on at various
intervals to pontificate on the feminist significance
of the work.  Which just made it ripe for discussion,
not "true."

I would love to see that documentary you have.  I'm
just fascinated by the whole groupie thing.  Again,
too exhausted now to figure out why.  Sorry.  Anyway,
thanks for writing back.

Best,
Arielle

Ray Bianchi said,

"a question just moved to Princeton NJ. looking for poets to socialize with, anyone open? First beer's on me."

Dear Mr. Bianchi,

Do you mean you want poets to come to Princeton to socialize with you in person, or do you mean you want them to come to Princeton via email? I can't come to Princeton in person because I'm on an island near Turkey, but if you meant the invitation in the pen-pal sense, I will gladly accept your money order (convertible) for $1.50. Write me if the latter, and I'll send you my mailing address, accompanied by a letter about poetry, and a money order for $7.25, which I believe is the price of a draft of Bud Light on Nassau Street in Princeton.

Hello Everyone:

Larry Jaffe, Antonieta Villamil, UNSRC Society of Writers and I are going=

to be working with the UN to help continue the Dialogue program started
in March 2001 and setup readings in celebration of UNESCO's World Poetry
Day.  We would once again like your help in organizing readings in your
city or town to celebrate these occasions from 17 March to 24 March 2002.=

 World Poetry Day is on 21 March.  We are working on another reading at
the United Nations building in New York City and have support from Noble
Laureate Wole Soyinka. The week of programs will be called "Dialogue Thro=
ugh
Poetry and World Poetry Day."  The focus will be "building a culture of
peace and non-violence" through poetry.  We hope you are interested and
look forward to hearing from you.  If you need a copy of the letter from
UNESCO, please email Larry Jaffe at  jaffe@dialoguepoetry.org or visit ou=
r
site at http://www.dialoguepoetry.org

Larry Jaffe and Antonieta Villami will be coordinating all of the events
around the world, so please contact them if you have any questions.

Below are the others programs for 2002.

(2) Poetry on the Peaks
 We are working on another program called "Poetry on the Peaks" which wil=
l
continue the UN's Dialogue Among Civilizations Through Poetry program sta=
rted
this year. Poetry on the Peaks will happen next year and will celebrate
the UN's International Year of Mountains. The goal of the program is to
setup poetry readings on mountaintops around the world and corresponding
readings in cities nearby. The readings will happen throughout 2002 and
will increase awareness of pressing environmental and social issues and
promote cultural heritage of mountain societies around the world. So far,=

I have commitments from Mr. Gordon Janow with Alpine Ascents Internationa=
l
based in Seattle and Eric Simonson with International Mountain Guides bas=
ed
in Portland. Together they will read poems on most of the mountaintops li=
sted
on our website. Pulitzer Prize winning poet and mountain-climber Gary Sny=
der
(over 70-years old) may climb the Alps next spring 2002 and read a poem
on behalf of this program. The preliminary list includes the Seven Summit=
s
(tallest mountains on each of the seven continents).

(3) Neruda on Mercury
In conjunction with Poetry on the Peaks, I have petitioned the Working Gr=
oup
for Planetary System Nomenclature to name a crater on Mercury after the
distinguished poet--Pablo Neruda.

Information about the program can be found at http://www.dialoguepoetry.o=

INTENTION // BRIEF DESCRIPTION


http://www.daemen.edu/pages/ggatza/you/


Can a poem still hold real meaning for a large audience given the medium
versus the media?

The idea was to take a relevant poem off of the page, print it on objects
and place them around a large, actively populated area. This would have the
reader engage a poem, in all of its disgusting glory, on a form that would
be easy to digest and reflect the area it was in. This blends a garden
walking tour with a fun house, having exhibits of a large poem, having no
real beginning or real ending, [as in traditional literature, this negates
the linear narrative] operating as one over a large space so the reader
could engage the poem from any angle. This method also allows for multiple
meanings and readings as all interactive texts have differing entry and exit
points.

The Daemen campus offers a unique situation to hold this installation. There
are no major advertising campaigns on the campus to compete with; for all
the right reasons, of course. There is not one billboard, placard, or
flashing light selling anything. Although there are the never ending parades
of leaflets heralding "credit for all" with low introductory rates for
uninformed freshman. Be this as it may, the poem can operate on its own, in
a media sanitized area.

        The poem is about the potential nature of the human spirit. This is the
common narrative for poetry, but it is central to who we are and are not; as
individuals and as a society. Sentiment is present, but it is not smarmy ...

        The poem is no longer a relevant object of expression because it cannot
compete, in true capitalist arenas. This is not to say that poetry is not a
viable format. I believe that if poetry was not a lawful obligation, or a
required course of study, it would be relegated to the poorly-lit sections
of the arts & craft shop. There are many causes for this ... one being the
proliferation of the sound bite and the flashing image. This should not be
perceived as a stumbling block, but rather as a source for inspiration.

        Dollar signs being true indicators of success in the marketplace, the poem
is not a worthy investment. Jewel did ok, but is this good poetry? Her true
media is as a recording artist, she has a hook. All good media needs a hook.
Hip hop offers the most optimistic outlook for performance language, as it
can incorporate all levels of media to heighten its message. For this
reason, there is a an accompanying soundtrack mixed by Edwar Manikhout. On
the tour, pop this into your personal CD player and let loose. The CD will
be available at the galley and on the website for download as MP3.

The poem is about the potential nature of the human spirit. It is good and
it is not good. It calls for amelioration. This is not your fathers poetry.



Avant-Pop artists and their pirate signals promoting wild station
identifications are ready to expand into your home right now, just log on,
click around and find them. It's all up to YOU, the interactive Avant-Pop
artist/participant. Postmodernism changed the way we read texts. The main
tenet of Postmodernism was: I, whoever that is, will put together these bits
of data and form a Text while you, whoever that is, will produce your own
meaning based off what you bring to the Text.

The future of Avant-Pop writing will take this even one step further. The
main tenet that will evolve for the Avant-Pop movement is: I, whoever that
is, am always interacting with data created by the Collective You, whoever
that is, and by interacting with and supplementing the Collective You, will
find meaning

Sorry for the obscenely long delay in responding. Wanted to respond when I
had a new version up. Took longer than I thought. But, then, I take it you
have a dev company e.g, Catherine, so you know all about it. Fresh

Part of the idea of this one is not just to substitute this or that with
that or this (e.g asteroids with letters/words) but to explore the literary
possibilities of the various forms that suggest themselves in this sort of
situation as capaciously as possible. There's a difference between making
gestures in the direction of letters or words and doing a literary computer
game.

I haven't really addressed yet the issue of the actual texts I'll use. I'm
still building the code. This happens often with the textually interactive
(and sometimes 'unfinished'--in Eno's sense) stuff I make. I'm thinking
about the possibilities of/for the texts all the time, but building the
engines first and seeing them in action before I do a 'final' text is quite
useful as preparation for the writing. Finally it makes for a better text
than putting the text first, though there are times when I do that too.

I'm working on a feature that allows you to write the text. Texts will be
savable in the next rev. That's in Canto 2. Perhaps some people will
copy/paste the texts they end up with and send them to me for possible
inclusion in the game. Tis a writing challenge to the great Poetics writers.

 Sorry, Rachel.  You're right about my being
 platitudinous.
We too (my generation)were activists and feminists,
though not very interesting dressers, relying
primarily on hair to signal our tribe.
 I think, however, I understand you better than you
think I do. It's only condedescending if you take it
that way. As for poetics, you brought it up on this
list so it must effect your poetics.
 You are personalizing the dilemna you describe by
 limiting it to your own age group; like suggesting
 that  the experience of identity crisis is exclusive
 to 40 year olds. Women and MEN equally suffer the
> "Oh-my-god-I-forgot-to-have-children" phenomenon.
 For some people it is an essential identifier, signal
 that one is an adult now, willing to take on societal
 reponsibilities. Of course a lot of poeople AREN"T
adults or ready.

 You are of course right that respect from the
culture is complex, and manifested in dubious ways.
And I'm sure you limited your examples to save us all
some time. But parenthood is very hard work for most
of us who don't have access to nannies and drivers. We
all hold scars attained in this endeavor and it puts
some years on the body.
  This isn't about whether or not some nice guy helps
you with the stroller. It's strenuous and messy, and
 requires shlepping, in your city and in every small
town, ghetto, suburb and ethnic enclave. If you forego
parenthood because it's hard work you are probably not
parent material. The social rewards have to do more
with joining the group who share the responsibilities
of adulthood; trying to nurture good men and women and
make a better world for them to live in. I know this
must sound like greeting card sentiments from old
radicals to you. Sorry I can't do better, but this is
no place for irony.
 Yeah, there seems to be a social abyss in this
 country between the people with kids and without.
That's not true in Mexico where I have lived, and it
is less true(again) in the poor ethnic enclaves of
America. A general lack of willingness to meet your
neighbors, entertain, celebrate, seems to mark this
moment in American social history.  Not the fault of
your generation! But it sucks. We should all have more
parties.
There is no key to understanding why one would want
 to be a parent, anymore than why one would not want
to be a parent.  But, yes, we can, and that makes it
hard to ignore. Especially, perhaps, if you have
 tested the waters,as you and your friends have, in
 other areas of self fulfillment.
 There was a "movement toward motherhood" in my then
 enclave, Berkeley, in the late 60's and early 70's.
 In part we were tired of battling the forces of evil
and wanted to build a new world upon the not-quite-
ashes of the old. Alternative communities,alternative
families and alternative methods of child rearing,
home schooling, all were considered part of making the
revolution.  I know this has all become fodder for bad
movies, but I let you decide how successful we were.

John Tranter posts about nitrites, which are practiced out in fields by
naked Druids, and such. Seriously, I always found chemistry illiteracy
funny too. In a tattoo mag a few years ago I came across art, covering the
guy's entire upper arm, of an alien creature which was ingesting many
sorts of recreational drugs: it was clutching pills, it had a needle
sticking out of it, and it was breathing from a tank prominently marked
"NO2." Here on our planet, nitrous oxide is N2O; what nitrogen dioxide
might do to lungs is left as an exercise for the reader. And this was on
this guy's ARM!

Cabinet has a web site at <http://www.immaterial.net/cabinet>,
which includes profiles of all issues to date. It's a very
high-production magazine with an impressive breadth of reference;
I strongly recommend it. Issue no. 1 contains prose by Tan Lin, a
piece by Christian Bok on inventing alien languages for Star Trek,
a CD insert (including Bok's rapid performance of Schwitters' Ursonate,
as well as works by Charles Bernstein and Steve McCaffery), a piece
on Oyvind Fahlstrom and invented language, work by Xu Bing, and
something of especial interest for readers of Spicer: an article
on the 19th century psychic Helene Smith, many of whose trances
"took her to the planet Mars" and were issued, with translation
by the spirit Esenale, in Martian:

Arielle,

No, I didn't get the impression that you thought women's sexual art
had to be feminist.  But, in discussions of CPC, the issue of
feminism constantly crops up.  She has repeatedly denied a feminist
impulse in the work, one of the things I find most interesting about
the work.  Her explanation of why she started the work--so she could
"get laid" by rockstars, is rather wonderful.  I think it refreshing,
a woman having private obsessions that don't have to be rationalized
with a feminist patina.

But, then I do think CPC's work has feminist implications, outside
her intent.  I also thought that her work was interesting and of
import--whether or not I personally liked it.  My liking it or not
liking it seemed beside the point.

"
I've a lot of sympathy for what is being said here but the above statement
is just not true: Donne always retained a certain 'currency', Coleridge for
instance was well aware of him, and from about the 1890's on he was creeping
back into fashion. I'm sure for instance people like Herbert Grierson were
just as much respomsible for his 're-promotion' as TSE
"

Well, there is the one Coleridge poem, "iron bound bands" (or whatever) --
and I think Browning also mentions him.  But he mostly vanished for hunners
of years.

Well, yes, Grierson was obviously crucial -- Grierson's 1912 edition was the
first decent one of Donne since the 1633 [just] postumous edition.  But
Eliot picked up on him via Grierson's _Metaphysical Poets_ anthology of
1923, in the TLS review, and there he spent more time on Marvell than Donne.
[AND later {the anglo-catholic Eliot} renaged, and said Herbert [spit] wrote
better religious poems than Donne.]

But yes, you need a combination of editors [Grierson] plus critics [Eliot].
Few do both -- except maybe Yeats editing AND writing on AND imitating Blake
in his poetry.

Robin Hamilton

(Not to speak of the Alexander Pope rewrites of Donne's Satires in the
18thC.  And the non-Donne poem in Palgrave. AND Donne only sneaks into Sam
Johnson's _Lives_ via Cowley.)

ASIDE:  Dave, next time we meet, remind me, and I'll give you a copy of my
edition of Donne.)

Marcella,

Don't you think that "the test of time" is at least *one* way of identifying
good artwork?  The thought is, I think, that over time, fashion doesn't
survive -- pretty flashes, little signals, etc, likewise perish -- but good
artwork holds meaning for generations.  This kind of 'good' artwork balances
carefully between temporal applicability and long-term ('universal')
significance. I know, I know, we of the corrected ideologies resist the idea
of universal meanings, trans-cultural significances, etc.  But don't you
think that there are some 'good artworks' that do 'stand the test of time'?
I mean, at the very least, and in careful application, isn't it a legitimate
measure?


> This idea has been used to justify the existence of the
> current white-male-dominated canon.

Let not your assessment of a principle be overwhelmed by your righteous (and
right) disgust at its abuses.

I concur with Michael Magee that Kasey's post on greatness was very helpful.
Thanks.

Amyl nitrites AND amyl nitrates are both used for heart medications.
Nitrite NO2, Nitrate NO3.  The poppers are the exclusive domain of the
nitrite, as you say.  Pop, whiff.  Apparently even doctors make this
nitrite/nitrate typo all of the time & apparently with little consequence
since both amyl nitrite and amyl nitrate are both effective treatments for
angina with similar action pathways.  Little consequence, I say, unless the
recipient is on Viagra and amyl nitrAte and already has heart problems.
Amyl nitrAtes are also excellent enhancers of diesel engine ignition.
Engine, hearts.  Primarily both, I believe, are vasodilators (dilate your
vasculature, lowering your blood pressure).  The use of nitrAte on angina
was an early experimental pharmacological breakthrough, back in the 1860s I
believe.  I think it was the fist success to arise from the field of
Experimental Pharmacology.

Amyl nitrate is not inhaled, I believe, but taken sublingually.  It usually
comes in the form of Isosorbide Mono- or Dinitrate tablets.

While I love Plath, I've always felt R. Grantham's anagram of "Suicide Off
Egg Rock" was at moments more correct than the original poem -- more precise,
and therefore better and more "well-standing."  Ha ha.  Of course, Sylvia knew
what  she was doing, but her poem wasn't able to articulate this quite as
well as a
computer-informational programming technique placed in the hands of a live
thinker.  But alas.  Such is life, as it were.  Naturally, the Ouija board
provided
her with "more fun than ... movie[s]" in her travels to the Colonies.  To her
great credit, I should add.  To the guilty sentiments I feel at replacing
her words
with another's, I sometimes respond with the obvious annulation, "the letters
are the same."

Tha anagram follows, apologies to those (many) of you who've already seen
this and similar productions.

"SUICIDE IN FITZROY ROAD
Seldom had she known a morn that freezing,
Not here in London. Still before the crack of dawn she rose,
Haggard, ravaged afresh from within, walking to the kitchen
To perform a last rite. Plates of oven-baked cookies,
Glasses of milk, off down the passage
To the children's bedroom as they slept - a loving look,
A last supper. Gravely she shut her babies' door,
Plugging the gaps with towels and tape - the housekeeper
Shall find them safe. Traipsing back to the cruel stove,
She moved a knob and, face cloth-swaddled,
Finally knelt before that sacrificial altar.
Her crippled mind swirled furiously. The fighting without
Had sharpened the fighting within, toward that brink
After the wretched break-up. Swamped now
By anguish and fatigue, the fuddled soul finally summoned
The ghost of resolve: there would be no more begging.
The acrid gas curling back about her,
Her agitated brain grappled with dreams, pondered echoes,
Babbled itself into dizziness, and at last
Acquiesced to blessed release." -- Richard GRANTHAM

On Ashbery's Greatness:

        "In my own mind, I come back to the critics. A post-modernist avant
la lettre, Ashbery foreshadowed, and later profited by, a style of thinking
which refuses to privilege meaning and structure, rejects hierarchies of
importance, saturates itself in culture and traditions but rejects the
values the traditions uphold. Hence, I think, the excitement his work held
for many people in the 1960s and early l970s. It seemed progressive, it
seemed to cast off the 'shackles' of comprehensible meaning, it conveyed
emotion without making clear what the emotion was or what it was about. It
had the air of culture, but required no work, neither thinking nor feeling,
of the reader. It was like the sort of political convictions that used to be
called radical chic: making various sorts of pretension, but having no goal,
finally, but to charm."

   - DM Black, from Issue 32 of Poetry London
http://www.poetrylondon.co.uk/issue32.html#review


The above quote is actually a less forgiving piece of an otherwise very kind
critique of Ashbery's _Wakefulness_.  I wonder whether we can say that
meaning and narrative are the same thing...Ashbery to me seems to throw off
the shackles of narrative in a way by using pieces of different narratives.
As it appears we shift from one narrative to another in his work we are
struck by a continuity of feeling but shifting subjects and objects.  Is it
fair to say then that Ashbery refuses to privilege meaning, or is it merely
that he refuses to privilege narrative that is coherent only in terms of its
subjects and objects and settings?

From Girls on the Run (part III):


But the wounded cow knew otherwise.
                                      She was at least sixty,
had many skins covering her own, regal one.  So then they all cry,
at sea.  The lawnmower is emitting sparks again,
one doesn't know how many, or how much faster it will have to go
to meet us at the Denizen's by six o'clock.  We'd have been better
off letting the prisoners stage their own war.  Now I don't know
so much, and with Aunt Jennie at my side we could release
a few more bombs and not know it.
                                  Everywhere in the tangled schist
someone was living, it seemed to say, this is my doing:
whoever shall come afterward is a delusion.  And I went round
the corner to say, Well, it sure looks like an improvement--hey,
why don't you tie your shoes, and then your bonnet will be picture-perfect?


For me the narrative in this passage has the coherence of dreams: constantly
shifting and always radically emotive.  This is actually a quite meaningful
passage but one that eludes meaning in the "story/linear" sense of meaning.
We shift from land to sea and back to land, and our subject is a cow, then
ambiguous, then the lawnmower, then someone obviously familiar named Aunt
Jennie.  There is the implication of struggle, exhaustion, confusion,
imagination, and doubt everywhere in this passage.  And I think that's the
meaning that Ashbery as poet is trying to impart: that what Ashbery saw in
Darger's work was in a way representative of all of the struggles,
confusions, ambiguities and doubts in a life as a homosexual male before and
after it was life-threatening to be openly gay (in many ways of course it
still is dangerous, but perhaps nowhere as near as dangerous as, say, in the
1940s), recollecting his survival of the seeming holocaust of gays (AIDS),
recalling his ways as a poet to speak of his ways in code, and the struggle
to open up with his way of writing.  In this book the narrator seems also an
old man looking back at his own life, a remembrance provoked by witnessing
Darger's illustrations of little girls with penises (re: sexually ambiguity,
clearly not fitting into any oppressive male/female binary category, etc.)
run away from people bombing them, the girls retaining some innocence.
Perhaps the narrator sees all of this complexity bundled up into the work of
Henry Darger, a man who was nothing but an artist.  Nothing but an artist in
the sense that Darger produced 25,000 pages of writing and illustrations and
otherwise was a recluse, living only for his art and for his daily trips to
church.  The ambiguous sexuality, the suffering, the proliferation of one
man's work, the lifetime choices of the artist, and the anticipation of
death is all present in _Girls on the Run_.  Obviously Ashbery was staggered
by Darger's work in a number of ways, as in it perhaps he saw his own doubt,
his own struggles, and his own end all right there, before him.  And so
perhaps Ashbery uses Darger's own language, pieces of his narrative, in
order to convey his own broken difficult narrative and the jagged nature of
its recollection.  Is this an avoidance of meaning or just another way to
deliver meaning other than storytelling?


                                  "Everywhere in the tangled schist
someone was living, it seemed to say, this is my doing:
whoever shall come afterward is a delusion."


It's as if this is the author himself now speaking, admitting he is witness
to a convoluted and layered life that reveals much about the present, while
other things are in doubt.  Perhaps this is the experience of sensing one's
own forgetting in reflecting on the loss of past friends (much alluded to in
the book), and that the people that come after those fading memories,
including one's own present self, are as delusional as anyone's imagination.
But we pop back in and out of Darger's text here, and I dare say this is
rather typical of much of Ashbery's poetry.

I see Ashbery's greatness (capital G) in this work, because he is able to
employ divergent pieces of narrative in order to explain a set of complex
and difficult emotions and experiences that are only as coherent as a human
being can be.  He pushes the boundaries of language through stretching and
weaving the tethers of narrative, and through that stretching and weaving we
are given a new universe, a new language.

Is innovation enough for greatness (provided this is an innovation on
Ashbery's part)?  Or is it the seemingly flawless execution of such an idea?
Or is this really just meaninglessness?

_Girls on the Run_ closes with the following words that might again fit my
discussion in a number of ways:


Does this clinch anything?  We were cautioned once, told not to venture
out--
yet I'd offer this much, this leaf, to thee.
Somewhere, darkness churns and answers are riveting,
taking on a fresh look, a twist.  A carousel is burning.
The wide avenue smiles.


Indeed we are cautioned many times not to talk of greatness.  We are perhaps
similarly warned not to try and nail down (even if we admit our
subjectivity, which is certainly wise) what we imagine Ashbery's poems to be
sharing with us.  But here is life, the end of life, the dynamic in-between,
the witness of destruction of innocence, and the openings of opportunities
everywhere.  But everywhere at least in _Girls on the Run_, there's more
than charm, there's the emotional oscillation of lives spiraling.  That is
for me certainly greater than a great cup of coffee.

Some on this list may be concerned to discover that the RCMP, Canada's
national police force, have, has, just insituted a Public Order Program in
order to figure out how to make better use of "non-lethal defensive tools"
(chemical spray weapons, rubber bullets, and tasers, mainly) during crowd
control at political gatherings, demonstrations, marches, rallies. A
spokesperson from the RCMP (Guy Amyot) states, "With all the violence going
on we had to create a unit that could help us [with] providing security."
The RCMP will work with other agencies such as CSIS (the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service) to exchange information, conduct "threat assessment,"
and, no doubt, to track the activities of political groups and individuals
under suspicion, including home visits and photo/video documentation of
public gatherings "to ensure if something happens we'll know what happened
so we'll have evidence for safety purposes" (Amyot). I'm finding that my
current poetics is no longer able to appropriately respond to these
astonishing provocations.

George and Richard,
     In my experience a little more or litle less of illness, infirmity,
social discrimination, etc. is rarely involved in making the final choice.
That is an individual choice which often appears to be related to others and
it's impact on them.

    One hypothesis re SP that hasn't been noted is that shhe was aware of
her problems and how they affected others and felt unable to change so
killed herself to spare her children being raised by her.  This may sound
harsh and unfeeling to some but is as plausible clinically based on
guesswork as some of the speculations I've seen in the literature.

     For me one of the interesting questions is how to judge the judgment of
someone who is suicidal?   Can someone who says they are going to kill
themself be sane?  This is not just an academic question as legally in my
neck of the woods I can make that judgment.

    I do want to spologize to any who feel bothered by the discussion of
this subject on the list,but I do feel as if I've gained by it.

You are the problem to most situations
Creativity flows naturally from our own prejudices and conditionings
                beyond the limits of experienced joy
nurtured from our inner being regardless of the dramas in our personal
lives. We feel
Satisfaction, hatred
compassion, anger, harmony, health

fear hinders growth.
Then we can begin
to know ourselves,
ponder universal innocence

book. fourth go at it.


the relationship of consciousness to the world vis-a-vis structure,
abstraction, symbolic systems. but the relationship of consciousness to
its inscription: who is inscribing: veering back from the concern, blind
ambition (see anecdotal) tending towards theoretical thwarting, return of
the repressed - immersive and definable structures which are negotiations
- irreversible or reversible - hierarchy of such structures - sets and
arrows - categories - the implicate orderings of consciousness within all
of this -

the quasi-logical structure of the lifeworld. but which lifeworld, which
state of confusion, which state of health: consideration of obsessional
neurosis as the holding-forth of the world, radical deposition - the
continuous need to inscribe, reinscribe - territorializations and assign-
ations - not the theoretics of doubt but the analytic inability to take
anything for granted -

the potential for philosophical investigation through audio-visual and
other media. but what style, what genre: whose investigation, what gender,
what methodology, what deployment of desire: questions of periodization,
extension of media on a continuous feed-forward basis, inextricably tied
down to corporate research and development programs - weakening of them-
atic thinking - the need to organization meta-methodologies of search /
knowledge strategies - on the other hand the loosening of semantics
through the muteness of audio-visual representations -

the natural order of structure. but what nature: whose nature: whose
cooperation: whose corporation: but what contractuality: the natural world
under the sign of capital, in-corporation, em/bodiment of nature, the body
politic, political body, structure transformed into performance, action -
but the chaotic debris of the body - extensions of flesh - subtexting in
which the dissolution of language is paramount, and always the problematic
of the symbolic - what is the binding of standing-in-for if not already
allegory, sign, inscription, intention -

consciousness in relation to subjectivity. but what consciousness: what
eidetic reduction: what cognitive mappings: what mathematical catastroph-
es: what tropes: the jump cut from phenomenology to mathesis, suturing the
subject for whom the book is written, the writing of explanation and
description and the problematic situating both, the cusp catastrophe as
that leap which creates structural extension, boundary, moving-on - the
fold, leaping into the fold, the relationship of the fold catastrophe to
the sheffer stroke and its dual - elsewhere of not-both-a-and-b tending
towards the nomadic, exhaustion - the exhaustion of "the species" or "the
organism" - planetary exhaustion, universal denouement - already present
in the specter of death - wandering in the dual - neither-a-nor-b -

virtual subjectivity and its relation to protocols, the imaginary, and
linguistic performativity. but which protocols: whose imaginary against
what inscription and whose thetic: but what languages and what mechanisms
of performance/perforation: who is speaking for whom across avatars, first
through other persons and tenses, what insistence carries the projection
and project of consciousness across real and virtual networks, what of
consciousness as such project, what of the peripheral imaginary, the
imaginary always already at a loss against or through the symbolic, what
of the symbolic as always already foreclosing, what of the toppling of the
scheme of things, what of alterities, multiculturalisms, sloughs, symbolic
emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and part-objects -
spoken within or spoken-for by avatars - consciousness as dialectic among
semantic emissions among subjects only some of which seem real - there are
always the virtual among us - ghosts, emanants, kami - ectoplasms at the
periphery - prosthetics, prostheses - who among us is cyborg cauterized by
insertion of flesh or electronic diegesis - moving among cyborgs - all of
us caught in virtual realities - the keywords absent, unknown - we exhaust
ourselves avoiding death and its already equally exhausted aporia - we're
drawn in and out of it -

the entrapment and proliferation of detail in a partially-cooled universe
between plasma and annihilation. but which inscription and which seal:
but what decade and what millennium: but what substrate and cosmological
constant: and what of the sweeping away of the diachronic, necessary for
the therapeutic or functioning of the organism within this space, this
imminency, annihilation at the limit taken to the level of the absurd-
catastrophic, debris - we're huddled in relation to our own demise - we
can smell the fear of it - the phenomenology of scent - nowhere and
everywhere at once - the smell of a person indeterminate, unidentifiable,
seductive - the procuring of death - writing and writing against it - the
continuous evolution of writing into and out of it - writing oneself into
existence - writing oneself out of it -

the orders and relationships among communication, communality, and sexual-
ity. but what mind lost among them: what sado-masochistic part-objects
modeling the contractual contrast of the world, who are the communities
that assemble consciousness out of linkages and couplings, out of contigu-
ities and contingencies, what are the mathematics that operate within
these fields such that the addition of a term in a chain may or may not
affect that chain, and the withdrawal of a term in a chain may or may not
transform the topology - what is the lure of a masochism in which all
theoretics are abandoned - the organism at the limit of its existence - "i
am still alive" - the shell or hull of the organism - the universal
condition -

fragility and specificity of operability and the human. but what goodness:
but what taxonomies of errors, mistakes, phenomenologies of corrupted or
failed teleologies, what judgments, what ethos: the constant collapse in
the face of catastrophe, beginning and ending with ground zero, the null
of physics politicized, culturalized, as the embedding of the focal-point
within the aegis of any project of the subject - the implosion of infor-
mation within and without the subject - think of the skein or membrane of
the subject, subjectivity - network subjectivity, subjective networking -
embedded survival - "i am still alive" -

propositional logics and the elsewhere of the sheffer stroke and its dual.
but whose withdrawal of the not-both-a-and-b, whose banishment of neither-
a-nor-b: what of the stroke itself engendered as | in relation to the dual
v, the stroke retaining the dissemination of division, the dual tending
towards the problematic of the scapegoat and expulsion - the nomadicism of
the disappearing map - the implosion of the map into the real - nomadic
annihilation of landmark, fluid kinship entities, constant transformations
- one might say survival "at any cost" - there are no universal discourses
- no discourses of the universe - automated writing - the philosophical
writing of/by the automaton -

doubt and deconstruction of conclusions. but whose doubt against what
standards and relativisms: what auguries of truth and denial: what obses-
sional neuroses: what ignorance, incoherencies: the autobiography of the
leap, short-circuiting or short-cutting ignorance, as if something could
be made out of whole cloth, there are always strategies of apology,
implications of humility, everything in the way, no clarity towards its
absence - theoretical weakening, weak theory, as the shifting behind the
scenes - think of the submerged philosophy of submergence in relation to
extruded theoretical abstraction, pronouncement, death and facticity -

the scientific as that methodology among others, in spite of heuristic
breakdowns and the problematic of mathematics. what crystalline mechanism
inherent of the tractatus-logico-philosophicus, what neoplatonism, what
conventions, inscriptive labor: retaining the last vestige of ontology,
giving existence a nearly-decomposable structure from groundwork to
lifeworld, superstructure disconnections, proliferations of objects,
elements, particles, things, organisms, universal constructs of contrasts
and boundaries, boundaries maintenance, the general economy of inscription
- episteme and ontology blurred - interpenetrations of regimes and domains
- conventionalisms and idealities both subject to the same dis/ease of
heuristic - bricolage or making-do in the world - this is hardly
satisfactory for anyone - this is hardly the case of the world - the case
of the world in relation then to the case of our being, dasein - the case
of the world in relation to dis/ease -

the topology of intention and neurality in relation to externalized mind
and memory. but what privilege of data-banks, whose computers, whose
optical fiber, whose skein of satellites, what membranes and firewalls,
whose hackings and what penetrations: the future of networkings among
multi-taskings, virtual realities, information wars, incandescent sexual
hysterias, thickened communalities, and the relationships among these and
other futures vis-a-vis theoretical abstraction and general accounts of
cultural and universal creation - teledildonics and nodal bodies - voy-
eurisms and exhibitionisms as inversions or dissolutions of entities,
categoricities - the splayed or opened body - the body displaying or
opening - the w/hole of the body - disruption or perturbation of percep-
tion - the skeins of death and exhilaration -

partial-objects and partial-mappings as givens in the construction and
reconstruction of the world. but of the gathering of accumulations and
assemblage of fragments, of the clutter and a-historicity of the world:
the disappearance of history, resonance of ideological tendencies among
historiographies, irrelevance of historical and theoretical recuperation,
the loss of the world among the world - the absolute loss of the world in
the future of the cosmos - writing/inscribing degree zero - the horizon
of the uselessness of organism - continuous eroding of transcendence -
grasping or cohering of imminence -

the use of cases, examples, anecdotality, perceptual modes, in relation to
theoretical abstraction. what stories hidden with failures, ridden with
failures, gaps in texts, hiatus, ignorance: what negations (there are
none): what tales (they're all fiction): what parables (pretense!): and in
relation to the audience, what demographics following what core phenomena,
core metaphors, what one might tell you of an evening in miami with grack-
les scrabbling among scraps of food already evincing a symbolic construc-
ted among all of us in crude parody of heisenbergian sheffer-stroke quasi-
analytical approaches, as if the natural world were no longer problematic
but a gift towards the understanding - or now, outside this hotel room
#330 there are cartons of palm pdas on the landing - they have been there
all day - some are opened, people are taking them - i imagine, idiotic-
ally, vast supplies of drugs - they're payoff - everyone knows what's
going on - right outside the window here - taken fearlessly - personal
communications and informal economies - more and more networks opening up
- you can see all of this from the window - i've drawn the shades - maybe
witnesses conveniently disappear - imagination runs wild - one never knows
-

exhaustion, defuge, and the wavering of existence in terms of the physical
well-being of the body, as well as the deconstruction of that well-being.
but what disease of the writer, what writing-disease: what textual wound-
ing: what ending to what written world: what semantics, what syntactic
endings: from indo-european to the absence of the subject in the sentence,
the absence of the eye and the shifter, the winding up of the winding-
sheet and loosening of the world from language in relation to or in spite
of natural kinds, rigid designators, performatives, proper names, who are
alan sondheim, daishin nikuko, who are julu-jennifer - what wounding of
informal economies - what disseminations - you can have any name you want
- take any gender - it's all there for the asking - nervously looking out
the window - who will be next - here in the motel room - what knocks on
the door - emptied hallways - strangely quiet around here -

but the dis/ease of writing - sound of keys - i can't stop this - the
living representation of information society - at work on the network -

what writing: what loss of writing to the world: such presumption that
continuous production becomes closer to the thing, defines it, the "thing"
or "it" or production, that the model of labor creates and forecloses
among entities, that divisions and boundary phenomenology are somehow
riddled with existence - always honing in - always flying apart - them-
atic thickening, weakening - the philosophy in this book - this attempt or
collocation of thought - this process of thinking - a kind of jabber- ing
back and forth from systems of representation through structuralisms
always nearly-decomposable, bricolaged, falling apart - writing ground
down - inscription as well - into the abstraction of thought constantly
retethered - the thinking of the return - nomadic homing-in -

that of or within existence - that of the nought, cipher - of weyl's
cartesian origin as the last vestige of the ego in mathematization - you
can always locate from that point - sufficient vectors, orthogonal or not
- giving thought the substrate necessary for reading - writing -

returning to the apparatus or partial-objects necessary for this - most
recently bought an antique glass pen - dip it in the ink, write for a
third of a page or so - hand-blown - here working with components made in
malaysia - the result of academic exchange - there are data-bases involved
- obsolescences - atavisms and dead media - prosthetics even in the
illumination of the screen (from before or behind) - what it is you are
reading "this" in - a whole system of temporary equivalences, technologies
- repetitions of databases - never forgetting a thing -

Call me sloppy sentimental, but every once in a while I get the urge to
publicly thank Charles Bernstein, Chris Alexander, and everyone else involved
with the creation and maintenance of this List.  I know I'm not the only one
who appreciates what these folks have done for a motley community of artists.
 Thank you one and all.  Best wishes always, Bill

Patrick,

I don't think it's the "young" part ("See half the world maintains young
Ganymedes!" --- Edward Thompson, "The Court of Cupid," 1770).  Maybe I'm timid.

I was one of those, in a sense, kept "at bay" with Kenning.  In a sense, Durgin
is "a necessary evil": an extremism that serves to define one pole of the
spectrum.  If you went away (counterfactual logic), someone else would have to
become the hard-liner.  I was glad to see your comic in the latest CHAIN, where
you poke fun at your own masculinist heroism ("Would I be willing to die for the
cause?" with brawny man hero cartoon in background).

After initial enthusiasm over Kenning, I sort of backed away.  I originally felt
very in tune with your uncompromising stance.  More recently, someone (a
Founding Father) mentioned you, quoting Durgin-esque "anybody who has anything
to do with ANYTHING WHATSOEVER is a capitalist defecter!!" (paraphrase) with a
sort of jejune world-weariness as though tsk tsk tsk they bite the hand that
feeds them tooth-shaped bubble gum.

You seemed to call for an absolutism where not only was no middle-ground
possible, but not even approaches ~within reach~ of the politburo ideal.  Like
the Talmudic idea of "a fence around the law": we cannot err even in the most
trivial of ways, for fear that a relaxation of vigilance at the front lines
endangers the Sanctum Sanctorum politick.  Pretty damn close remains CAPITALIST
ENEMY, Kenning-ethos, seemingly.

Meanwhile (over 30, to be exact: "Me only cruel immortality / Consumes"  ---
Tennyson, "Tithonus," 1907-8), that definiteness looks different elsewhere,
dubious.  As far as words that I can or cannot say (I cannot say inaudible
words)--- "Capitalist" is a term UNDER ERASURE, by virtue of The Fall of The
Wall, the defeat of Soviet Marxism.  It is ~impossible,~ from where I stand, to
retain credibility and to invoke "Capitalist!" rhetoric.  And the same critique
is difficult to navigate, to re-circumscribe, using "free market."

It is becoming increasingly unclear to me (presbyopia?) what this awful evil is
that we're fighting against, Patrick.  Sure, every teenage boy grown up into a
feminist punching bag wants to be subversive, but--- subversive of what?
subversive to what extent?  Subversive like Samson, pulling roof down yanking
pillars?  At some point, it became clear to me: I'm too timid.  I'm not prepared
for chaos in the streets, in the halls, on the door mat, "revolution".  That's
SURVIVALIST, thinking you'll manage okay with a canteen of rations and a sandbag
waiting out the Internationale.

It was a remarkable paradigm shift, from aesthetic to poltical, and in so many
other ways, but there was something ~incomplete~ in the Language critique, and I
don't think we've managed a revaluation that's determined where those moth hole
soft spots are, and what continues to stand, to motivate.  Lately, I suspect it
has something to do with pluralism, Language's tendency to monolithicize the
dominant and hence to make resistance very untargeted and generic,--- whereas
the political may have its real pressure points at an extremely LOCAL level, and
globalism may serve dominance's end by diverting us to an abstracted political
ether, now New Media instead of ~neighborhood.~  --- And I suspect, though
unprepared to articulate, that there's something about IDENTITY that Language
missed.  In its ongoing, correct critique of the personal (as a screen that
blocks the public-collective-political), it confused personal with identity.

See--- again, not that you care but--- I find myself in the embarassing position
of being an avant-gardist ~manque,~ a ~failed~ experimentalist.  I ~thought~ I
was being "cutting edge" (AUTOBIOGRAPHIA LITERARIA OF A COMPLETE FAILURE
NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF IN THE FIRST PLACE OR WOULD NOTICE IF HE DROPPED OFF THE
FACE OF THE EARTH depressiveness).  But the problem was: I ~wanted to be
published!~  The desire to be published kept me fashioning my styles by
~imitation,~ thinking well if the radicals won't accept me I could always maybe
sneak through the middle-range into some college-sponsored journal or something
. . .  And I read too much, I think.

Second Generation Language Poetry tends toward utter ~dilluteness~ of meaning,
rather than destruction of meaning.

The literary-political tactics of 1980 are rendered obsolete twenty years later,
by the ever-changing nature of The Beast.

And--- the main means of de-fusing that "capitalism" has is--- to ~absorb,~ to
~represent~ its opponent, to ~include~ (thus, the heart-rending Fence/Rebecca
Wolff "problem": it's very difficult to take exception with them or irritate by
condemning, because ~they're doing good work,~ in spite of it all).  Dominance
re-proposes that its enemy is its Alternative.  There will be an ~Alternative~
festival of what used to be the unacceptable, the Barbarians at the gates.

"Resistance," that Kenning means to stand for, might only be able to be
accomplished by being ~un-reproducable~ within the conduits of "the system."
I'm far from anti-academic and I think the extended longevity academia is giving
Language is a good thing,--- it's significant that the unacceptability of
Language Poetry found a weak chink, the curiosity of the academic intellect
after the difficult-to-understand, and the compulsion to explicate, and that
through that pore --- subcutaneously? --- it's perpetuating itself and has found
a break in the fire wall that's forcing incorporation into what ~should~ be
rejecting at as a foreign body, as its nemesis.

The International Center for Photography presented Hans Bellmer's "puppe" (Ger.)
doll parts series under a new explication: Bellmer resolved that throughout the
Reich he would do no artwork that could be of service to the regime.  And so,
found something ~un-reproducable~ within the surrounding culture.  It could not
even be shown so as to make a laughingstock or to point to it as what's wrong---
the way those anti-NEA ministers managed to publicize postage-stamp sized porn
negatives out of context from a David Wojnarowicsz (sp?) collage.

I'm not sure I could write avant-garde/experimental even if I ~tried,~ as I
~did~ try.  Some of this may be constitutional.

ANOTHER UTOPIAN MANIFESTO PROPOSITION: Every poet, like in 1984, should adopt a
deceased or "disappeared" poet, and carry that author around in her/his work as
the missing Ego/Other surrogate.  We do not need new poetry.  A new danger is
resulting from ~overpopulation.~  All this "great"/not-"great" talk has been
rendered silly, outdated: "great" was possible only within a very small
population, was patriarchal, leader-of-the-pack, competitive.  The sheer numbers
of poets at this point threatens to drown out perception of any one.
Unforeseeable positions are called for, when a few dozen has increased to a few
hundreds has increased to . . . thousands, I guess, there must be tens of
thousands of poets at this point, right?  Collective may be insufficient.  WHY
can't "radical" poets surrender their proper names?!  Why is a poetry of the
~signed~ and autographed, authored, perpetuating itself in an age where
advertising, journalism, etc., etc., etc., are all anonymous?

Anyway . . .

I don't think I "get it" anymore.  Where's the How To manual, please?  There is
no conscious or articulated politic for this politicized writing to adhere to.
It's all Wittgensteinian beetle-in-a-box.  Your politic is Patrick, but is there
any guarantee, any ~chance~ that the Top Ten list of political blue meanies on
your hit list match Jeffrey's, or Rebecca Wolff's, or Rasputin's?  Jeffrey's: 1.
Cars are bad. Global warming.  2.   Movies/video-in-any form is bad.  3.
Caffeine is bad.

Now, ~PETA~ is succeeding at a genuine radicalism (!).  The starting point seems
to be--- I am complicit.  I am unable to stop participating in and supporting
the very things my "conscience"/ideals condemns.  But--- most of us very
possibly live in utterly idiosyncratic country-of-one auto-cultures, us
X-poets.  We don't ~need~ to resist.  We're such a bunch of freaks, anyway.
Like, the rebellious mutants.  It's ~enough~ that to be a poet is already so
fantastically weird.  Even the most "conservative" New Yorker poet stands in a
position of freedom that insults the larger culture at every step by ignoring
it, disdaining.  This attempt to be ~doubly~ a Cro-Magnon ~and~ subversive is---
odd.

Any how . . .

So, that's why I'll re-subscribe to Kenning and send you six bucks.  They will
each be six inches long, Patrick.  I will press them flat with my hand as if
ironing them, to smooth them of any wrinkles or creases before mailing them.
And the postal office worker, momentarily diverted from yet another post office
madman rampage, sniffing the scent of dollars ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT, may tear
open the envelope, nibbling at it like a rodent, so all Kenning will receive
will be a torn-open envelope with the SCENT of money in it.

HOW BIZARRE that you're talking "radical" and at the same time proposing prudent
usage of "hard-earned six bucks"! like a Farmer's Almanac, Consumer's Digest of
poetry.  WASTE money.  Nobody here works hard for six bucks.  We do jiggle dance
and they slip bills in our busts.  In our g-strings.

SOME LIFE


I'm in trouble
because I've been thinking again,
looking for footprints in water.
You must have met a man
who wanted to say something
but didn't know how. He talks into the mirror,
hits his head with a hammer. Slumps
to his knees, mouth open,
a tunnel bored through solid rock.

There's work to be done
and you understand pain,
how predictable it is. Walking around the streets,
drinking in bars, trying to sell old cars.
On pain-killers since birth.

Some of these muscles haven't been used
for years; some of them I think we forgot we had.
Time flies.
Promises are often hard to keep,
but faith is bloody impossible
to whip up out of nowhere.

We carry on unsure
of the way we are doing this,
or what it is we're doing.

The book we bought,
the one with the diagrams
that makes making love funnier than it already is.
I've denied having it three times now.

You have to open your eyes and pay attention to things.

At night I used to be scared
for my life, and some things don't change very much, ever.
For these rheumy aches in my legs
whenever the air is damp, thank you.
They're part of my inheritance,
along with taciturnity, dolefulness and solitariness.
Thank you.

Thank you.
All these years stuck with my own company,
and I don't think much of it.
It would be nice to be comforted. It would be nice
to be wrapped in cosy blankets
and calmed by the smell of essential oils
like an Arab who knows how to be at home at home.





Blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah some blah blah blah
blah blah life blah blah blah blah

It would be nice
to be able to find what you're looking for in the Safeway
but I suppose that's not exactly the point,
even if your state of mind
too often comes to depend on it.

These two,
stuck in their house like strangers in a cell.
I love them
and if The Ice Age is ending
we'll try and organise the gangs
to shovel the water off our fields,
to wring out the bedding,
and to point out the difference
between the melting ice
and the sweet silent tears of regret
in which people like us might drown
with no one to listen out for their cries of despair.
No one to chuck them a rope
to be saved or hung by.

"The last thing we saw was his hand,
clutching vainly at the air, ever hopeful of a passing straw."
And that was the end of that.

The noise an aeroplane makes makes
us look up and we see the sky's canopy engraved with patterns
that mean something different to each of us. Mystic, it was.
Nearly fucking occult.
But I couldn't stand it,
all that fluff in the brain instead of on the mantlepiece.
I believed in the sky
but not in what people insisted on seeing
in it. It's just the sky. Not heaven, not your home.
Only the sky.

We worry about turning into our parents.

So we wander out into the winter gales.
The wind is like a wall: you can lean your thoughts against it
and they are revealed in their true size,
which is often stupidly tiny, they’re hardly worth mentioning,
though we should mention them,
have to mention them, if they are all we have.
Yes, these are all I have.
You could put them in a toilet bag and have some room left.




The world is falling apart.
People are killing people,
and our hair looks okay. And most things
seem to happen in other countries.

It's cold on the back of this horse,
on the top of this tram,
at the summit of this small hill
we try and clamber up each day
refusing to admit we can never reach the

We're not ready to make history;
reading about it is difficult enough. Troubles grate
on our nerves like fingernails on slate
and lately I've not been able to sleep.
At three in the morning I'm looking at my luggage
as it sits at the edge of another new day, daring the Sun.

The newspaper lands, full of darkness,
on the mat with a dull thud
and there's stuff in there we don't understand.
Things with wings fly out when we open it.

A woman asked me if I wanted to dance and I did
but couldn't, so I faked a brilliant limp and a story
about a car crash, and I think she wanted to dance with me
even more after all that. Now the chain of thought is broken
you can burst in if you like on this tiny drama of a tiny life
and create your own mayhem.

Why be mournful?

Who is behind the curtains in that lighted
window across the street and what they are doing is none
of our business but it would be interesting to know. It would be
interesting to know if it's interesting.

And I know what it's like to be worried about the future:
such worry holds my hand long into the night, even now.

There are things that should be said
and things that never can be said and as you get older
you should try and say as much as possible because when you're dead
it's too late and you might die with people thinking you thought
everything was okay.

It's no good laughing.
Some people do think that everything is okay.

This is a bit of a departure from my usual for the list but Ive managed
to get a poetry page in Organic Valley's newsletter, ROOTSTOCK.  We are
looking to feature 3-5 poems by a single poet & I am specifically
looking for work which embodies ecology, organics, health, healing,
homesteading, populist politics....    This is a 20 page tabloid
newsprint, distributed nationally to food coops & as such is by no means
a bastion of avant garde literary activity.    Deadline for submissions
is Sept 5, 2001.   Send your submissions to miekal.and@organicvalley.com

  I'm happy to see(are they still column inches on the www?)
  the column inches the bay guardian devoted to Kevin Killian's
  new book Argento Series from Krupskaya. The big man's a
  hard worker, a true servant of poetry, he deserves every inch
  of any attention he gets.
                                     At the same time, I'd be remiss if I didn't
  take this opportunity to extol another essential release from
  Krupskaya, Ogresse Oblige, by  Dorothy Trujillo Lusk, the bp
  nichol chapbook award winner, within which you'll find further
  glimmers of the working class Ezra Pound by way of Frank O'Hara
  and Robin Blaser she's becoming.
                                                     Dorothy tho, is the anti-snot as snot,
  for her, intellect is as by the way as bread and butter, as a bellylaugh.
  Dorothy's returned from Oz possessed of a wicked tongue the devil
  has no reigns on, she's une deflateur non pareil. Among her contemporaries
  Stan Douglas, Peter Culley, Kevin Davies, Lisa Robertson, Mina Totino,
  Gerry Creede, Susan Clark, Kate Van Dusen, Michael Barnholden, she's
  got the biggest teeth. Her poems are more effective than pills. Read these
  aloud in the shower, the pages aren't rubber, but the nouns bounce and
  rebound, announce and denounce, the vowels make your tongue grow.
  Thanks Krupskaya!
                                 Vancouver's websters were out in force for the launch
  of Ogresse Oblige at the new KSW(formerly Nat Bailey)Stadium. The
  legends Maxine Gadd and Judith Copithorne, the east end syntax resistor
  Rhoda Rosenberg, the unendingly famous George Stanley, the ghostbusting
  globetrotting philosopher Stan Pesky, Steady Eddie Byrne, Mike The Mug
  Barnholden and Gerry the Anti-Flaubert Creede.
                                                                             Robin Blaser was so cool,
  he wore a green sombrero and red Daytons. He and Sharon Thesen arrived
  late, stood in the doorway while Dorothy read and skedaddled before the encore.
  The retired George Bowering, joking as usual. If you're a Vegan are you aloud
  To watch a meatier shower? Oy vey. Leonard Cohen couldn't make it but his man,
  billy little, the millionaires' poet, put in a special request for a poem without budgies.
  Quel marrant! When a meteor showers what does it use for shampoo?

Date: Mon, 20 Aug 2001 09:42:07 -0400

hi jim and gang

look, i am appalled at the idea of a "no unsolicited manuscripts"
policy.  good gods, if you're truly THAT drowning in work when open
without caveat, then caveat, i.e. "theme" submissions, or a small
section of time each month, or year, in which to submit.  or acquire a
few friends with some interest, make a GREAT dinner, and feed them in
exchange for everyone sitting down and weeding out the submission pile
once a month.

"no unsolicited manuscripts"?!!  how cliqued out!  how SAD.  a tiny,
blinkered set of friends and mutual admiration society sit about
nights congratulating themselves in print?  YUCK!  and not even FUNNY,
as at least Pickwich Papers, a satire in part on such ventures, was.
or, think back to the blazingly awful epitaphs from Huck Finn...

when i was editing (geez, that sounds like the beginning of one of those
'we walked five miles barefoot in the snow to get to school and were GLAD
of the chance' stories...), anyway, back when i was editing, and we didn't
have computers, and everything had to be typed by hand on typewriters we
built ourselves, chipping out the typeface from blocks of stone... ok,
i'm exaggerating a bit...

when i was editing, the sludge pile was a joy of our lives.  i could
have stuck to the little circle of people i knew, whose work i knew,
and what a bore THAT would have been.  but an open door let all kinds
of quirky, wonderful work in.  a couple of my favorite writers, in
fact, entered via the unsolicited manuscripts pile.  it makes for
surprise, for opening your vision up, for learning about something
new, for developing, growing.  for finding new people and nurturing
them into stronger writers.  for an emphasis on growing, developing,
nurturing, rather than snittly "guess who i turned down!" mentality.

i'm reminded of seventh grade, when people started having parties.
some people would have great big sprawling parties and many would get
drunk or/and wasted and fall down, and there would be general mayhem,
rejoicing, and seventh grade awfulness.  and some would have these
"small" parties, "select" parties, where either only a small,
predictable group of the Same Old Gang would come and bore each other
silly, often even smaller than intended because invitees couldn't
stomach another such dull affair, or a small Select Group would come
and host would have bragging rights over all the people she DIDNT ASK,
and the week before, people would start being nice to her who never
gave her a moment of decency before (all so they could get Invited)
and at then end of those Small Select Parties, many would get drunk
and/or wasted and fall down, and there would be general mayhem, not
much rejoicing, some gloating, and a substantially larger portion of
seventh grade awfulness.

holding my morning oj, i raise a toast to leaving seventh grade, and
its attendant awfulness (among which i include the Mullet, rayon button
up blouses, and bell-bottoms).

[This reply is somewhat incomplete (defective), as a comprehensive survey
of “Helen” goes further than this--- but as other matters are distracting
me for greater thoroughness here, I thought of posting this as is,
preliminary.]

JJ was back-channeled:

on the Greek metrics?  I know of nothing like this published on H in E,
nor on HD at all, really.  Do you have any suggestions?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Thank you for calling my attention to “Helen in Egypt,” which I had passed
over too lightly: I’ve been pursuing a genealogy for mainly
double/multiple-stress feet, and “Helen” didn’t seem pertinent.

I’ve now scrutinized the “Helen” meter extensively.  Here’s what I find:

1 I3/I3*, A3/A3*; variations (A.I, I2.A2, etc.)

About three-quarters of the lines can be completely summed using
conventional meters such as anapestic trimeter (A3: _ _ / _ _ / _ _ / ) or
iambic trimeter (I3: _ / _ / _ / ), with some trochaic lines (T: / _ . . .
) and dactyls (D: / _ _ . . .).  There are novel but recognizable
combinations of those four standard feet: A.I, I2.A2, DT, DT2, etc.  And
there are occasional, conventional (I5) iambic pentameter decasyllables ( _
/ _ / _ / _ / _ / ). {Not necessarily a pentameter, but an amusing instance
of a decasyllable: “the syllables H-E-L-E-N-A” [P.VII.2]}

FEMININE:

Many of these meters end with an “extra,” unstressed syllable which I mark
----f: I3 or even I3* (below) become I3f ( _ / _ / _ / _) and I3* ( _ / _ _
/ _ / _ ), A3 becomes A3f ( _ _ / _ _ / _ _ / _ ), etc.  In standard
contemporary Formalist scansion, familiar lines such as iambic pentameter
or such are “allowed” to assume an additional, extra-metrical syllable:
those lines are called “feminine,” which, in the case of H.D. and the
~feminism~ surrounding her, seems like an apt reading.

That scansion, though, is vulnerable to a larger re-mapping of the entire
book as possibly hinging on two important, other classical feet uncommon to
American English readings: the cretic ( / _ / ) and amphibrach ( _ / _ ).
The case for terminal amphibrach is not, though, a particularly strong one,
I believe: lines inexplicable by any other system are few.  Regardless, I’m
left inconclusive on this point: it regains relevant upon examining the
amphibrach/cretic lines in “Helen”: three-syllable lines consisting of only
one cretic each (“gold from dross? / death from life?”), cretic dimeters
(cret2: “~flame,~ I prayed, ~flame forget~” [P.I.7]; “No--- I spoke evil
words” [P.IV.8]; “underneath vault and tomb” [E.I.6]; “day before
yesterday” [P.IV.3] = D2?; “being god-like and poor;” [L.III.3] = A2?/Dod
B?; “so my throat knew that day” [L.VII.3] = A.cret? A2?!),
cretic-choriambic (cret.chor: “Amen-Zeus, let me not ask” [P.II.8],
appearing after the above-cited string of two full cretic lines, hence
“weighting” its reading against an interpretation as lekythion), or cretic
leading into exceptional “colarions” [figures] helpfully interpretable as
containing cretics (cret, I.cret: “bring her here / to join hand with hand”
[P.V.5] = cret, bacchiac.I?), or in combination (cret.T2: “Learn of me
(this is Paris)---” [L.I.8]).

It also seems cursory to ignore final unstressed syllables as feminine
since, when followed by lines beginning with iambs they set up a
transversal! cross-line dactyl/anapest and, more significantly, when
followed by anapests, they create three unstressed syllables (a pyrrhic, _
_ _ ), a rhythm uncommon to pre-XXth cent. poetry that’s difficult to
explain by Formalist conventions and hence more interesting as a Modernist
phenomenon.

----------------------------------

(The first two syllables of an English verse are typically the most
vulnerable to ambiguity.)

Here’s where it gets interesting:

Almost half of the above-mentioned trimeters come in a consistent
alternative: they vary the ~middle~ foot, using the associated complement:
two outer iambs begin and end a line with an anapest in the middle --- I3
becomes I3* (or I.A.I: _ / _ _ / _ / ); vice-versa, a trimeter with
beginning and ending outer anapests may take an iamb in the middle foot: A3
becomes A3* (or A.I.A: _ _ / _ / _ _ / ).  In fewer cases, forms like T.D.T
(trochee-dactyl-trochee: / _ / _ _ / _ / ) appear.

In H.D.’s practice, the interchanging of these alternatives is very musical
and constantly surprising in a way that makes it understandable why someone
would have made no progress in detecting the pattern.  It must seem
constantly shifting and changing read aloud, although simultaneously
continually familiar.  Every time one of these line starts, it can go in
one of two directions, and from there branch out into further-multiplying
ramifications.

2. DODRANS A/B, HEMIEPES, PENTHEMIMER, etc.

 There is a heavy use throughout the book of a line ( / _ _ / _ / ) known
in classical meter as DODRANS A, and its anti-type, DODRANS B ( / _ / _ _ /
) (although Dodrans are nor technically classified as part of the
iambic-anapestic family, but aeolo-choriambic).  These less familiar lines
may be worth quoting, at the offset; many of them are questions, and
book-sections often start with dodrans:

DODRANS A

few were the words we said,        [1.3]
turning to view the stars,         [I.6]
How could I hide my eyes?          [I.8]
This is the spread of wings,       [II.4]
Will he forever weigh              [II.7]
Helen against the loss . . .         “
suddenly weighs me down              “
Love should be born of War?  . . . [II. 8]
written upon the Walls,  . . .       “
whether he broke the law             “
What does he mean by that?  . . .  [III.2]
many the problems solved             “
Why should I answer him?           [III.4]
why does she hold us here?         [IV.1]
listen and make an end  . . .      [IV.2]
Helen will be your share  . . .      “
this is the iron-ring,  . . .        “
how did the story end?               “

[In the arguable cases where the line ends not in a clearly accented
monosyllable (“stars,” “eyes,” “wings”) but in more ambiguous
pronoun/particle-type words (“him”), others might read the lines as D2,
dactylic dimeters, / _ _ / _ _  .  The upswing inflection of the voice at
the end of an interrogative sentence, that slight rise of pitch, though, I
think weights the meters more strongly toward Dodrans A.  Also, I find few
“pure” D2s in the book.  D2 functions more as part of a larger (often
“falling” rhythm”) line, such as D2.T: “merciless strokes for the Flower”
[Eidolon, VI.3],  “over the smoldering embers” [Eid.IV.8], ---

Even where a pure D2 may be discernible (Eid. V.4: “numb with a memory”),
the final ambiguous syllable is of a type conventionally mis-accentuated  .
. .]

HEMIEPES

Anyone giving even cursory attention to the matter of classical/Gk. metrics

you are correct about the beer price, but since you are in Turkey the beer

Do not pay entry fees.
Do not get subscriptions as a price of being
considered.
Do not pay an agent.
Do not listen to "no unsolicited manuscripts".
Send the poems, the cover letter and (if you want
it back) an SASE.

If you don't want to have a slush pile, DON'T
START A LITERARY MAGAZINE!

If you cannot convince four or five people to
read the submissions and make intelligent,
unbiased decisions as to what is in and what is
out, then LITERATURE DOES NOT *DESERVE* TO
SURVIVE!

Contests are a way to raise money. Do you want to
raise money for your magazine? Have a bake sale.
Hold a benefit concert. Sell some blood. Don't
get the money from the poorest sort of writer
there is.

Friends who send me e-mail about poetry contests
think they are doing me a favour. They aren't.
Are contests any fairer than the usual process of
submission? No. Just pricier.

If there were a poets union I'd vote to boycott
contests, reading fees and subscribe-to-publish
nonsense.

I'd rather save my money and spend it on books or
single malt scotch.

hi jim and gang

look, i am appalled at the idea of a "no
unsolicited manuscripts"
policy.  good gods, if you're truly THAT drowning
in work when open
without caveat, then caveat, i.e. "theme"
submissions, or a small
section of time each month, or year, in which to
submit.  or acquire a
few friends with some interest, make a GREAT
dinner, and feed them in
exchange for everyone sitting down and weeding
out the submission pile
once a month.

"no unsolicited manuscripts"?!!  how cliqued out!
 how SAD.  a tiny,
blinkered set of friends and mutual admiration
society sit about
nights congratulating themselves in print?  YUCK!
 and not even FUNNY,
as at least Pickwich Papers, a satire in part on
such ventures, was.
or, think back to the blazingly awful epitaphs
from Huck Finn...

when i was editing (geez, that sounds like the
beginning of one of those
'we walked five miles barefoot in the snow to get
to school and were GLAD
of the chance' stories...), anyway, back when i
was editing, and we didn't
have computers, and everything had to be typed by
hand on typewriters we
built ourselves, chipping out the typeface from
blocks of stone... ok,
i'm exaggerating a bit...

when i was editing, the sludge pile was a joy of
our lives.  i could
have stuck to the little circle of people i knew,
whose work i knew,
and what a bore THAT would have been.  but an
open door let all kinds
of quirky, wonderful work in.  a couple of my
favorite writers, in
fact, entered via the unsolicited manuscripts
pile.  it makes for
surprise, for opening your vision up, for
learning about something
new, for developing, growing.  for finding new
people and nurturing
them into stronger writers.  for an emphasis on
growing, developing,
nurturing, rather than snittly "guess who i
turned down!" mentality.

i'm reminded of seventh grade, when people
started having parties.
some people would have great big sprawling
parties and many would get
drunk or/and wasted and fall down, and there
would be general mayhem,
rejoicing, and seventh grade awfulness.  and some
would have these
"small" parties, "select" parties, where either
only a small,
predictable group of the Same Old Gang would come
and bore each other
silly, often even smaller than intended because
invitees couldn't
stomach another such dull affair, or a small
Select Group would come
and host would have bragging rights over all the
people she DIDNT ASK,
and the week before, people would start being
nice to her who never
gave her a moment of decency before (all so they
could get Invited)
and at then end of those Small Select Parties,
many would get drunk
and/or wasted and fall down, and there would be
general mayhem, not
much rejoicing, some gloating, and a
substantially larger portion of
seventh grade awfulness.

holding my morning oj, i raise a toast to leaving
seventh grade, and
its attendant awfulness (among which i include
the Mullet, rayon button
up blouses, and bell-bottoms).

can't let this one pass by without comment.

' no unsolicited manuscripts' does not rather automatically mean that the
publisher or editor only publishes work from a small and select group of
people. it simply means that the said editor or publisher might in fact
limit the amount of work they can successfully address, i.e, give time and
attention to. a publisher without this policy soon learns that they will be
overwhelmed with work, depending upon the amount of submissions. if one
receives 10 manuscripts a week, its hardly likely that they will be able to
give the time and attention that the writing(and writer) deserves.
(nurturing principle)
when a publisher says that they are not accepting manuscripts unsolicited,
perhaps the writer needs to realize that every publisher is not willing to
give every last vestige of their time. in example, i had a poet call me on
my wedding day, wanting to know about their book. i explained that this day
was not the best of times to discuss the subject as i was trying to get the
last of the flowers and supper ready, hadn't yet put on my gown, etc and
please, could i get in touch another day? the writer said sure. what about
tomorrow morning or the coming weekend?  'nope', i said. 'that would be
christmas eve and day, to say nothing about my honeymoon'.
your idea that one hold a dinner party for a few friends and get together to
read manuscripts sounds charming and delightful. unfortunately, a dinner
party for forty people (the number of willing readers we would need), and a
time block of however long it takes to read through the pile doesn't take
into account the length of certain manuscripts. i like to read every word
myself, and if a manuscript is over 100 pages, well, do the math. i need
more than a few hours to give the work my full attention, and besides, who
the heck is cooking/serving the dinner for forty? doing the dishes?
the analogy to a small and spoiled select group of publishers as compared to
seventh graders getting together for keggers is interesting. frankly, i read
read work all day long. i do this sober. i give full and intelligent
feedback to the work. that's my method.
writers need to realize that the publisher is not on a power trip from hell,
but someone who devotes their time and attention to successfully bring work
to light. my own analogy is we are midwifes. i know of no successful midwife
who sits back on their fanny with a mug in hand. frankly, any publisher on a
power trip would soon find themselves weeded out. word gets around, and what
comes around goes around.

its a symbiotic relationship between a publisher and writer. we are the
final step before a work comes to light, and the writer should remit a
complete work ready to publish. not a work that 'needs some work, don't you
think this is good, where should i go from here, etc.'

a final word. every letter of rejection i write is thoughtfully undertaken.
not a matter of ' guess who i rejected today' mentality, but complete with
suggestions on furthering the writer and writing. i work hard at this, as
hard as the poet who writes. the process is just as demanding and time
consuming. we do not take this lightly.

Hey, do you know what ever happened to, or how to get in touch with,
the great Chicago-area poet Joan Fisher?

I totally lost touch with her, and unpacking my boxes found much correspondence

Malt does more than Milton can, as they say? As for unsolicited

Michael. Right on. No unsolicited or a mag that has "members only" is
already a waste of time. From now on I'll send anywhere if at all, and -
being conscious of the reality of editorship, and accepting various negative
or positive comments realistically, without bitterness, and maybe in some
cases "taking (the editor in question) to task" if I feel that that is
appropriate. Editors (albeit it is a difficult and onerous job) have become
so presumably to assist literature and give opportunities to writers. They
should be open minded. I (as an ideal editor if there's such a thing) would
look at everything: at least I'd  have a "slush" pile , but I'd run them
past again to check if I'd missed any Rimbauds. Politeness and honesty and
promtness in dealing with submissions is also good. Mistakes are made by
editors and "submitters". I actually joined a mag "Spin" and paid the sub
with the thought that thus I'd be published. OK that was reality but I've
ceased subscribing to another mag because it seems to me to be elitist even
if outwardly "avant-garde": this is my view but I think if I was an
ambitious young poet I'd submit "across the board" so to speak including the
nefarious New Yorker: actually I did send a prose poem satirical thing there
and an offer to write about the NZ lit scene but that was rejected. Of
course I'm a NZr and also the NYorker, to be fair, as they say, must receive
millions of such requests or submissions (which is not to stop me from
submiting again - what "stops" me now is getting the time, the will etc).
What I wanted in that case was yes some glory but even more a good
remuneration. Alas it didnt happen. Alternatively "the young (or old)
aspiring writer" could make his/her own books.
I have entered competitions..and I would have been chuffed to win, but now,
in consideration i feel that they are a kind of "ego trap": who is to judge
my work? Fundamentally, they may make suggestions, but it is me myself! From
now on I refuse to enter competitions or be impressed with who's who so to
speak in lit. The important thing is to write. As a "trade off" I'd submit
to various mags and more or less ignore the rules and regs knowing that a
human is the editor. Emily Dickinson is my "heroine": great it would have
been had she been more proactive on her own behalf (but that may not have
helped at the time) but she kept on regardless. No competitions for Emily
I'd say!

But no one ever won a Chess game by resigning and no one ever got published
by not trying or not submitting and a lot of people "broke the rules": maybe
most did. Dylan Thomas's first published poem was actually written by
another boy! I believe that Marrianne Moore submitted one manuscript 30
times! That sort of thing.
  Rejection happens: that's what you learn from. It's called life. But then
sometimes you "break through" You never lose unless you say to yourself: "I
lost that one."  Go forth and multi text!   Regards, Richard.

"The test of time" is flimsy and cheap, has propped up too
many undeserving writers in our field.  Abuse far outweighes
benefits.  We are witness to anthology after anthology that
steals from the poor and gives to the undeserving rich. The
contributions of women and poets of color may never get their
day beneath this endless rain of falling anvils.

We must accept that good artwork is sometimes lost, sometimes
forever.  There is no magic force that will someday lay judgement
to assure that cream rises.  We must be smart and relentless, must
spread the word, like in recent John Godfrey posts.  There are other
poets we know and will know who must and should rise to surface.

Subject:      Phoebe Gloeckner in the NY Times
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

The Bay Guardian piece on Kevin's book is wonderful, almost as wonderful as
Kevin's book is great.

On a related note, Phoebe Gloeckner, who has been in a bunch of Kevin's
plays, & who is one of my all-time favorite cartoonists, just had a
similarly wonderful piece written about her in the New York Times Sunday
Magazine. It was in the August 5th issue, which someone just sent to me, so
I apologize that this news is a bit old. (Maybe it's up on the NY Times
site? I don't have access to it right now, so I can't check ...)

I kind of can't believe it. Phoebe's cartoons, which are largely
autobiographical, deal with childhood sexual abuse, with teen prostitution,
drug scoring, etc., etc. (For those who don't know her comics work, she also
did cover art and illustrations for a number of Re/Search books, including I
think the Body Fluids book and J.G. Ballard's Atrocity Exhibition.) Her
first collection, A Child's Life, is I think still banned in France, and had
to be printed after-hours in the U.S. because a lot of the people working at
the printers where her publisher had them printed wanted nothing to do with
it. For a lot of people, it's deeply upsetting work, & for a number of
fairly complicated reasons -- all of which the Times article, unbelievably,
addresses.

There's only one place in the article where the Times sort of "backs off" --
they won't print the words "blow job," so they substitute [perform oral
sex], like that, in brackets, instead -- like the line you'd cross wouldn't
be about content, but form. Otherwise, Peggy Orenstein, who interviewed
Phoebe & wrote the piece, is completely straightforward, sympathetic,
curious, & unapologetic.

It's doubly amazing that this piece got printed because A Child's Life came
out a couple of years ago, and Phoebe doesn't have a new book out yet,
although one is in the works. (A sort of hybrid -- part novel, part graphic
novel, "Diary of a Teenage Girl," which again is largely ((maybe
completely?)) autobiographical.)

So, like, how did Orenstein decide to write about Phoebe? How did she
convince the Times to run this? Phoebe is pitched neither as a victim nor as
a purveyor of lurid entertainment. She's pitched as a serious artist using
the subject matter that has had the greatest impact on her life. It's
totally amazing, respectful & unexpected.

Kasey--

I appreciated and found your assessment compelling, and yes the general
sense of greatness seems goofy but one I have come to accept. Yet,
surprisingly, an ideal vague term to learn from, but there are three
areas of greatness that I have experienced that are not accounted for in
your post.

1.) The Living Great Theorem: There are these poets who are remarkably
great while alive. From the people I have learned from, Charles Olson
would fit into this category. I am not convinced of his poems greatness
and find his lack of economy allowing moments of greatness, sometimes
even whole letters from Maximus, such as the one where Ferrini is
shredded (#3 is my memory), but never a long duration. Yet each of these
"direct contact " informants, or almost direct, assures me of his
Greatness (as in your #1), an opinion which I have never found
legitimated within his texts. Therefore, I have deduced there was a fire
present in Olson that moved others to momenteous tasks, that worked as a
inspiring conduit to cast others to their peak. Ted Berrigan also worked
in this fire causing role, the difference being that if I decide to read
the Sonnets or Things to do in Providence this morning his page still
recasts that incantatory moment. A living poet that fits this role is
Ralph LaCharity, who rolls city to city, performs at open readings,
transports guerilla acts of poetry upon the listeners, and when looked
for, has disappeared already. Perhaps you have seen him, he was a
student of Kaufman, Dorn, & Duncan, drifts through your part of CA every
so often, nearly never reads as a feature because the moment of poetry
has to burn through his hands before he will bother to perform. In one
memorable (two poem hit & run) reading he announced "If I do this poem
correctly the audience will hear two languages at the same time. The
first language is an approximation of third century Greek, the second
will be heard in an appalachian vernacular." Then his prediction came
true. Except to retell this fragment, I cannot describe this instant any
clearer. He simply vibrates the listeners towards the act of creation. I
will attempt to document LaCharity recording-wise before this inspiror
only leaves the legend of those moments, but, similar to the page, I
still will fall short of that full fledged audience member experience.

2.  The Single Poem Theory:  There are many writers I've read who have
Great single poems, a poem of the highest magnitude, THE poem, in every
sense. The poem is an impossibility, often a first one-bullet creation
slaying every member of its audience. This is the true proof of God's
existance. There is a wide expanse between the writer who has a poem of
the first magnitude and the poet who has a book-length enigma of these
stars. For this reason, single poems are not worthwhile arbiters of
Greatness.

3. The poet who is passed among poets. Niedecker, before she was
academically talked about, had her work passed among poets. Arnett is a
similar poet currently. All of his books except for one were published
in editions of no more than 400 copies and usually 250. Other poets
carried the torch. That is greatness.

I do believe poets can be alive and great.
If any have seen Yevgeny Yevtushenko
your theory goes out the window.

My next collection is on a series
Greatest Hits
consisting of 240 some poets
of which I am the youngest contributor so far
a series which includes, to mention true openness,
John M. Bennett & Marvin Bell.
The full title of mine is
Greatest Hits: from the Greatest Poet in the World

Why would one want to be a mediocre poet?
The colonel learned from Keats when he dubbed the "King"

A new danger is resulting from ~overpopulation.~ All this
"great"/not-"great" talk has been rendered silly, outdated: "great" was
possible only within a very small population, was patriarchal,
leader-of-the-pack, competitive. The sheer numbers of poets at
this point threatens to drown out perception of any one. Unforeseeable
positions are called for, when a few dozen has increased to a few hundreds
has increased to . . . thousands, I guess, there must be tens of thousands
of poets at this point, right? Collective may be insufficient. WHY can't
"radical" poets surrender their proper names?! Why is a poetry of the

One or two things to mention--

I am seeing a trend of listees
saying "why aren't you open"

To truly be open
takes a lot of time.
Try out a listing in Poet's Market
or, in our case, have an author
appear as a full-feature in their pages.
We get 600 some manuscripts a year
unsolicited & solicited
plus 50 envelopes a week
do the math. Then there's e-mail.

Being truly open meant
reading a lot of crap
which influenced the writing
of our intro to #5.

Back to the main idea
--do not mistake me--
this is about the poem, Jim,
were I back at that point eight
years ago where I could be polite
and say hello to everyone
who came through the box
I would do so, but
if authors think being known
to some poetic degree
legitimizes sending
agreeably lesser work
to me, my favorite practice
is to tell them exactly where
I have seen better current work
of theirs. I feel it's my job
if they are on target in other places.
Most full-size poets write too much, medium size
and little poets have a tendency to write less
and therefore have a better chance with us.

Rather than placing myself above the authors,
I feel I owe them for their work
and have even went as far as
offering an open invitation
to poets who have appeared in our issues
whose books are sitting at other publishers
for us to put pressure on the publisher
until the book appears or we end up publishing it.

Sometimes we do take a person's first
submission, but we usually publish
two poems minimum and tell the author
--it's a conditional acceptance--
and now they have 6 months to come up with a second
accepted piece before they appear in the journal
else the acceptance becomes void.


Be well

Thanks for the links. I guess there's not a lot out there on the web.
Typical of infinite beings to avoid finite spaces...
I came across Godfrey in From the Other Side of the Century and was really
blown away by his more lyrical poems, like "Radiant Dog". I really liked
the sexual imagery in "Bath". I haven't come across many male poets who
write about sex (and write about it well), so this one really stood out.
I'm interested in that interview. Is there anything in there about his
poetics/process/method any or all?

Notes on Court-Martial from A Manual For Courts-Martial: Courts of Inquiry
and of Other Procedure Under Military Law, Revised in the Judge Advocate
General's Office and Published by Authority of the Secretary of War, Cor-
rected to April 15, 1917, Washington, Government Printing Office, 1917:

...
A fray is a fight in a public place to the terror of the people, in which
acts of violence occur or dangerous weapons are exhibited or threatened to
be used. All persons aiding or abetting a fray are principals.
...
To quell is to quiet, allay, abate, or put down.
...
Rape is the having of unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman by force and
without her consent.
As the carnal knowledge must be unlawfully had, a husband who has carnal
knowledge of his wife _forcibly where she does not consent_ is not guilty
of this offense; but he is guilty when he assists another man in having
such carnal knowledge.
Any penetration, however slight, of the woman's genitals is sufficient
carnal knowledge, whether emission occurs or not.
The offense may be committed on a female of any age, on a man's mistress,
or on a common harlot.
...
Assault with Intent to Commit Sodomy
Sodomy consists in sexual connection with any brut animal, or in sexual
connection, per anum, by a man with any man or woman. (Wharton, vol 2, p.
538.)
Penetration of the mouth of the person does not constitute this offense,.
Both parties are liable as principals if each is adult and consents; but
if either be a boy of tender age the adult alone is liable, and although
the boy consent the act is still by force.
Penetration alone is sufficient.
An assault with intent to commit this offense consists of an assault on a
human being with intent to penetrate his or her person per anum.
...
Analysis and Proof.
This articles applies to officers and cadets only.
The article defines one offense, viz:
1. CONDUCT UNBECOMING AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.
PROOF.
(a) That the accused did or omitted to do the acts as alleged.
(b) The circumstances, intent, motive, etc. as specified.
...
163. Specification: In that -----, while posted as a sentinel, did, at
-----, on or about the ----- day of -----, 19--, loiter on his post.
...
167. Specification: In that -----, while posted as a sentinel, did, at
-----, on or about the ----- day of -----, 19--, sit down on his post.
168. Specification: In that ----- did, at -----, on or about the ----- day
of -----, 19--, commit sodomy upon the person of one -----.
...
The inducement contemplated is verbal only, but it may include any argu-
ment, persuasion, threat, language of discouragement or alarm, or false or
incorrect statement which may avail to bring about an unnecessary surrend-
er, retreat, or any misbehavior before the enemy. The offense will not be
complete, however, unless the words spoken do induce some person other
than the accused to misbehave, run away, or abandon or surrender a com-
mand. It is to be noted, however, that speaking words whose natural ten-
dency is to induce others to do any of these things may in itself consti-
tute misbehavior of the speaker within the meaning of the article,
although the words spoken induce no misconduct on the part of others.
...
I. Misbehavior before the enemy.
II. Running away before the enemy.
III. Shamefully abandoning or delivering up any command.
IV. Speaking words inducing others to misbehave, run away, or abandon or
deliver up any command.
V. Casting away arms or ammunition.
VI. Quitting post or colors to plunder or pillage.
VII. Occasioning false alarms.
...
The defense had no further testimony to offer and no statement to make, or
having no further testimony to offer, made the following verbal statement,
Or, having no further testimony to offer, submitted a written statement,
Or, requested until --- o'clock -. m. to prepare his defense.

Subject:      Why I was a bad poet (was: greatness; editors, editing, etc.)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

At one time I had the stupid idea that it would be possible to write poems
persuasively in an impoverished idiom which--even though it was deliberately
crude, trivial, ironically effortless, etc.--would possess a badness that
would be somehow analogous to the sophisticated, expressive badness of
paintings by visual artists like Sigmar Polke and Picabia--an aesthetic that,
by the way, is almost a cliche in the art world.

Now there are a lot of reasons why, as I say, I was being stupid.  But
fundamentally it was a redundant idea.  My biggest mistake was not to see
that alternative, av-garde--whatever-you want-to-call-it--poetry is already
(by definition) bad.  I don't mean this in a pejorative sense necessarily,
but it should be obvious that strategems of subversion (or fashion) are
always immediately launched by calculated outrages against conventional taste.

Everybody today, as Ashbery insists somewhere, is avant-garde.  There are New
Formalists, of course, and neo-Confessionalists, and so on, but no one takes
their own heirarchies of taste for granted anymore, or views these as
self-evident or natural (though the degree to which taste is seen to be
subjective or objective varies of course along a wide continuum).

Get rid of all of the fetishes, dogmas--the excrescences that accumulate
around art--and describe the nature of poetry *qua* poetry.
Ok--Indefinability--indescribability, even--are paradoxically givens.  But
it's the very experience of a poem--its affect (indescribable or
not)--considered as an end in itself--that is poetry's ultimate value:  not
cognition, as C. Greenerg writes, but cognitiveness.

I'm not expressing this very well;  this is just a post to a listserv--no one
will get thru the whole thing and, still, I'm only telegraphing my point.
But  I'm trying i suppose to set up an opposition:  that is, while poetry qua
poetry resolves, as I said, essentially around the experience of poetry as an
end in itself (an experience which is reflexively judgemental:  i.e. "this
(poem) is worth my attention or not"-- and so dependent on judgements of
taste), at the same time the heirarchies of taste have been effectively
undermined (for all poets, exp or not) by the av-garde.

What have been the strategies of this subversion?  My second big mistake, you
see, was to take for granted that experimental poetry outrages taste by the
renunciations it makes.  Its innovations are always a form of something less:
  less narrative, less syntax, less beauty, less structure, less metaphor,
etc., etc.  But there comes a point, you know, when saying that you like
"bad" poetry, or that you want poetry to share the condition of dirt (as Nate
Dorward, I think, recently said to me), or that boring is better, or that the
politics, not the quality of a poem, are what's essential--there comes a
point when these kinds of things become only a form of bullshitting oneself.
**Without taste, there's no such thing as poetry.**  Mike and Kasey, I get
and follow yr point, but the whole problem w/ contemporary poetry is the
evasion of the highest expectations and the heaviest pressures of taste.

**Even if the "best" can never be adequately or universally determined for
everybody (of course not),  you still have to constantly ask this of
_yourself_.  That is, you either take responsibility for your own taste, or
you don't.   Which is exactly the opposite of submitting to received ideas.

But this is precisely the pressure --the capacity to bear down --that poets
and  poetry can't seem to stand up to anymore--av-garde or otherwise.  There
are many talented and brilliant poets--and there are many poems to like---
but the medium they've inherited--as well as the social position of poetry's
invisiblity-- is too impoverished to accomplish anything that's not minor.
**(I mean it's important to realize that even the so-called conventional
poetries have systematically stripped themselves of the genre's traditional
resources.)**   For alt poetries, the most successful recourse (in certain
precincts of the academy) has been a kind of exquisitist writing--Palmer,
Guest, Lauterbach, Cole Swenson, Peter Gizzi, and so on--comparable in a way
to the turn in the editorial direction that Sun & Moon eventually made.  It's
often brilliant stuff, but it  also manages to be both anemic and somehow too
rich.  You'll starve on a steady diet, but throw it against the wall and it
will stick.

What's left, on the one hand, is fashion--which is entirely what is being
invoked by the constant rhetoric on this list of "new," "emerging,"
"younger," poets, editors, readers, academics, blah, blah, blah.  On the
other hand, the evasion of and the resentment against the demands of taste
make possible, I admit, an ethically beautiful experience of community and
collaboration.  The value of this is at least as great as making "great" art,
but you should be aware at least that you're not--you can't be-- doing both
at the same time.  The way I've settled it for myself is to stop writing
poetry.


In a way, the academy--the theoretical wing-- left the LangPos way behind.
As Perloff suggested a while back, the aesthetic does not have any special
value for cultural theorists.  What wss impt about LP were the manifestos
(irrespective really of whether they were right or wrong);  the LPs never
were in any theoretical position to promote the poetry *as* poetry, though of
course this is what they can't help doing.  The impasse is symptomatic of the
evasion of taste.

Bill Luoma's _My Trip to New York City_ is really the bad book that I wanted
to write.  Unintentionally, perhaps, he exposes the way that poetry is made
now:  as a matter of fashion and community--cliquish, humane, competitive
(but unambitious).  And dumb.   And bad, most of all.

I'm shocked to see such a starkly Kermodian argument buried in your
sternly Andy-Kaufmanized Nietzsche -- that after all, poetry carries
affect --

and I'm not surprised that you've avoided the old linear-logic path of
the therefore --

but wouldn't a poetry that transmits on a greater part of the affect
spectrum maybe avoid this badness, this superstrain of uncool you seem to
diagnose?

Eh?

Yours is an eloquent post.  Nice to hear from you again Jacques.

I must "confess" that it is difficult to see you reduce contemporary poetry
to the following:

"What's left, on the one hand, is fashion--which is entirely what is being
invoked by the constant rhetoric on this list of "new," "emerging,"
"younger," poets, editors, readers, academics, blah, blah, blah.  On the
other hand, the evasion of and the resentment against the demands of taste
make possible, I admit, an ethically beautiful experience of community and
collaboration.  The value of this is at least as great as making "great"
art,
but you should be aware at least that you're not--you can't be-- doing both
at the same time.  The way I've settled it for myself is to stop writing
poetry."

Fashion, from people you label with "blah", and "evasion of and the
resentment against the demands of taste" are all you seem to see left in
poetry outside cultural critique and "exquisitist" writing.  There's nothing
left?  Nothing?

I do see piles and piles of shit everywhere.  It's rare to find a Really
Good Poem in all of the journals that go around, and so many collections of
poetry seem to be very lazily and unambitiously produced.  It does seem much
of what I find is all affect, black leather jackets and cool shoes,
cigarette smoke and Campari floating between freshly painted walls, the
dream of a close-up photo of the author's face on the cover of "Poets &
Writers," but that's not everything.  Uninspired poetry written by poets in
search of content, sure, everywhere.  Poems with inspiration and content
craft and beauty is rare indeed, if not impossible.  That should not be so
surprising, however.  But I have been surprised that as I have worked harder
to find inspired poetry, poetry without regard for 'the correct or the
latest theoretical trappings."  I have begun to find it.  It's around.

I'm not sure what you mean by taste, but I think what you mean by it is
perhaps some evidence of craft and/or skill in combination with some sort of
emergent wondrous property.  Something that evokes feelings of wonder and
admiration, that says, this is an achievement?  I just want to say that the
poetry's out there.  It's just not always visible around these parts.  It
takes hard work to find it.  There are folks who really try hard not to give
a shit about labels, despite the potently viral nature of the label
business.  And there are inspired folks.  But inspiration is remarkably
fleet, ephemeral, and conjuring inspiration can be and often is deadly.

I'll even be so brave as to give an example of something that I think fits
the bill of "inspired", "doesn't resent/reject craft", "is crafted"
"possesses content" and "is beautiful":

OFFING

What your dark eyes take back
to itself, hugged in a curve
of toughness.  The land between us is flat.
Let's say we are ruined, Minneapolis,
bricked against ourselves.  A red rag
in the kitchen.  This isn't important or I am.

I never wanted to touch you
and still do.  How can we pray or find
what collects in heaven, Father.
I'd be surprised by elegance,
meaning something like rugs
and leather.  Soft and tough.  This.

I want belief like this.  Leaving
the sea is a rag doll I once was.  Texas
clouds in dreams, swinging.  My loving you
once, mud puddle, swing set.

 - Hoa Nguyen, from _Dark_

There are worthy poems out there. And some of them are even written by
"young" poets.

I do not see the necessity of a disjoint relationship of "an ethically
beautiful experience of community and
collaboration" and "'great' art".  Can you explain why you believe these are
necessarily disjoint?  Does "greatness" require the effort of no more than
one person?  I can see a number of possible answers (ones that do not compel
me to agree with this negative thesis) and so I wonder if you mean to imply
a normative answer or a descriptive answer?

Perhaps what you seem to positively advocate is some sort of comparative
poetics?  Where poetics is not evaluated in terms of some cultural or
theoretical substrate but instead in terms of other poems?  If so, I think
this is a brilliantly lucid and obvious head that maybe every avant-hat has
somehow missed.  Such an effort would require hard work.  Yes, indeed.

My interest here is not to prove you wrong or reveal your weaknesses or any
sort of come-uppance, but to pique your brain, to see to what extent you

book. the sixth go at it all.


the relationship of consciousness to the world vis-a-vis structure,
abstraction, symbolic systems. but the relationship of consciousness to
its inscription: who is inscribing: veering back from the concern, blind
ambition (see anecdotal) tending towards theoretical thwarting, return of
the repressed - immersive and definable structures which are negotiations
- irreversible or reversible - hierarchy of such structures - sets and
arrows - categories - the implicate orderings of consciousness within all
of this - untended: unintended consciousness: my work is already an es-
cape, already unfounded: the phenomenological investigation of this rela-
tionship requires a certain sensitivity: i have granted myself this: fol-
lowing thought into harder structures: following structures into their
languor or lassitude:

writing, within, or against, the paragraph, writing among texts, return to
the repression of style, continuous honing, innuendo, negation, contrary
and contradictory, of the sixth go at it, against the other five,

the quasi-logical structure of the lifeworld. but which lifeworld, which
state of confusion, which state of health: consideration of obsessional
neurosis as the holding-forth of the world, radical deposition - the
continuous need to inscribe, reinscribe - territorializations and assign-
ations - not the theoretics of doubt but the analytic inability to take
anything for granted - exhaustion as a condition for the constant recon-
struction of the world: thinking of the play or theatrics of the world:
methodologies of distancing and absorption:

of the sixth go at the philosophical, against the other five, the inter-
stice of thought, thought's blurred reminiscence, thought's thoughtless-
ness,

the potential for philosophical investigation through audio-visual and
other media. but what style, what genre: whose investigation, what gender,
what methodology, what deployment of desire: questions of periodization,
extension of media on a continuous feed-forward basis, inextricably tied
down to corporate research and development programs - weakening of them-
atic thinking - the need to organization meta-methodologies of search /
knowledge strategies - on the other hand the loosening of semantics
through the muteness of audio-visual representations - what one might call
"kidding ourselves" through the semblance of research: that's all there
might be to it: a certain carelessness of thought: fudging, the kludge or
glitch: loss of rigor: one might speculate that even the theorization of
such loss constitutes a defensive fortification against theorization
itself:

of the sixth, the go at it, defending the other five goes, of the text
which insists on veering out of genre, of the genre of the philosophic, of
the literary,

the natural order of structure. but what nature: whose nature: whose
cooperation: whose corporation: but what contractuality: the natural world
under the sign of capital, in-corporation, em/bodiment of nature, the body
politic, political body, structure transformed into performance, action -
but the chaotic debris of the body - extensions of flesh - subtexting in
which the dissolution of language is paramount, and always the problematic
of the symbolic - what is the binding of standing-in-for if not already
allegory, sign, inscription, intention - think of the bound body as al-
ready the hieroglyph and its politicization, the restraint of the symbol-
ic: arousal, tumescence, distension, stretched or opened skin: upwelling
of debris and frisson, shuddering, stuttering, trembling of the subject:

or of the sixth go at it, binding the other five, of the politicization of
philosophy, the ideology underpinnings, of the sixth go at it underpinning
itself, loosening, "hardly something to write home about,"

consciousness in relation to subjectivity. but what consciousness: what
eidetic reduction: what cognitive mappings: what mathematical catastroph-
es: what tropes: the jump cut from phenomenology to mathesis, suturing the
subject for whom the book is written, the writing of explanation and
description and the problematic situating both, the cusp catastrophe as
that leap which creates structural extension, boundary, moving-on - the
fold, leaping into the fold, the relationship of the fold catastrophe to
the sheffer stroke and its dual - elsewhere of not-both-a-and-b tending
towards the nomadic, exhaustion - the exhaustion of "the species" or "the
organism" - planetary exhaustion, universal denouement - already present
in the specter of death - wandering in the dual - neither-a-nor-b - it is
as if it splits: neither one nor the other: then there is the proboscis or
exploratory thesis: we have escaped the monadology:

of the sixth go at it, expelled from the rest, temporally following after
the others, "camp-follower," the go explaining everything, the diegetic or
diacritical go, of the interstitial, of all of them, of the goes to come,

inserted into enumeration: unaccountable and unaccounted-for: "there's no
telling" of the soul: "there's no telling" of the eye: there's no future
but hunger: no future but the desire or commitment to one or an/other:

there's no telling of the sixth, the sixth does the telling, it's as if
the sixth were told to itself, whispered to itself, it's as if the sixth
were imaginary or avatar, hardly an insertion, as if the sixth were
suddenly, irrevocably, scratched into the text, as if its place were
placed and forgotten, as if one "walked away" from meaning and its defen-
sive fortification,

virtual subjectivity and its relation to protocols, the imaginary, and
linguistic performativity. but which protocols: whose imaginary against
what inscription and whose thetic: but what languages and what mechanisms
of performance/perforation: who is speaking for whom across avatars, first
through other persons and tenses, what insistence carries the projection
and project of consciousness across real and virtual networks, what of
consciousness as such project, what of the peripheral imaginary, the
imaginary always already at a loss against or through the symbolic, what
of the symbolic as always already foreclosing, what of the toppling of the
scheme of things, what of alterities, multiculturalisms, sloughs, symbolic
emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and part-objects -
spoken within or spoken-for by avatars - consciousness as dialectic among
semantic emissions among subjects only some of which seem real - there are
always the virtual among us - ghosts, emanants, kami - ectoplasms at the
periphery - prosthetics, prostheses - who among us is cyborg cauterized by
insertion of flesh or electronic diegesis - moving among cyborgs - all of
us caught in virtual realities - the keywords absent, unknown - we exhaust
ourselves avoiding death and its already equally exhausted aporia - we're
drawn in and out of it -

it's as if the sixth were a portal to the fifth, it's as if the fifth were
coming forth,

we're speaking as if we're spoken-for: we're spoken-for as if we're speak-
ing: imagine a speech bypassing to such an extent that it occupies another
stratum entirely: that it appears to come from elsewhere: from neither-a-
nor-b: that it is one with aurality:

of the sixth which is bypassing, which is already speaking against itself,
which is attempting closure, finish, beyond the denouement, which is of
the end, ending itself against the rest "of them,"

the entrapment and proliferation of detail in a partially-cooled universe
between plasma and annihilation. but which inscription and which seal:
but what decade and what millennium: but what substrate and cosmological
constant: and what of the sweeping away of the diachronic, necessary for
the therapeutic or functioning of the organism within this space, this
imminency, annihilation at the limit taken to the level of the absurd-
catastrophic, debris - we're huddled in relation to our own demise - we
can smell the fear of it - the phenomenology of scent - nowhere and
everywhere at once - the smell of a person indeterminate, unidentifiable,
seductive - the procuring of death - writing and writing against it - the
continuous evolution of writing into and out of it - writing oneself into
existence - writing oneself out of it -

the sixth go at it all already written out of it, as if these intersper-
sions no longer existed, as if one were subservient to the future
anterior, the very scent of the sixth, its huddling, its refugee status,

the scent bringing us back: the scent of the w/hole, anal musk: the scent
of the cauterization of philosophy: the anal fissure - not the inscription
of a / not-a, but the fissure of the same among/within the same: substance
fissures, structure breaks at inscription:

of neither inscription nor fissure, of the sixth, already broken, of its
annoyance, almost the scent of decay,

the scent of abjection, falling-apart: the body bound, held taut against
or within the generation of the hieroglyph: substance into structure
through the release of no-thought: desire: glyph:

the unmentioned or unmentionable sixth go at it all, hardly a considera-
tion, variorum editions piled on, one after another, as if in collusion,
collaboration with the enemy, espionage, each reading the other, of public
consumption,

the orders and relationships among communication, communality, and sexual-
ity. but what mind lost among them: what sado-masochistic part-objects
modeling the contractual contrast of the world, who are the communities
that assemble consciousness out of linkages and couplings, out of contigu-
ities and contingencies, what are the mathematics that operate within
these fields such that the addition of a term in a chain may or may not
affect that chain, and the withdrawal of a term in a chain may or may not
transform the topology - what is the lure of a masochism in which all
theoretics are abandoned - the organism at the limit of its existence - "i
am still alive" - the shell or hull of the organism - the universal
condition - but the rupture from everyday life: but the return: it is at
the juncture that the contract is enacted: that use becomes exchange: the
incipient or implicit or implicate or emergent quality of the signifier:
the word just beginning as the bonds are released:

released into the sixth go at it, the problematic of enumeration beginning
all over again, releasing the sixth into the hinge between closure and
further operations, as if, to operate upon the book, the text, a universe
of universal operations,

fragility and specificity of operability and the human. but what goodness:
but what taxonomies of errors, mistakes, phenomenologies of corrupted or
failed teleologies, what judgments, what ethos: the constant collapse in
the face of catastrophe, beginning and ending with ground zero, the null
of physics politicized, culturalized, as the embedding of the focal-point
within the aegis of any project of the subject - the implosion of infor-
mation within and without the subject - think of the skein or membrane of
the subject, subjectivity - network subjectivity, subjective networking -
embedded survival - "i am still alive" - "i" turns against itself: is
turned: is shredded: cannot turn: loses "its" domain: fissures: it is here
within this fissuring that "i come closest to the substance of the world":

but the sixth go at it is not the sixth go at it all, not of the sub-
stance of which it is a part, not fissured or broken down, not corrupted,

propositional logics and the elsewhere of the sheffer stroke and its dual.
but whose withdrawal of the not-both-a-and-b, whose banishment of neither-
a-nor-b: what of the stroke itself engendered as | in relation to the dual
v, the stroke retaining the dissemination of division, the dual tending
towards the problematic of the scapegoat and expulsion - the nomadicism of
the disappearing map - the implosion of the map into the real - nomadic
annihilation of landmark, fluid kinship entities, constant transformations
- one might say survival "at any cost" - there are no universal discourses
- no discourses of the universe - automated writing - the philosophical
writing of/by the automaton - the writing of the tape-recorder: imagine
such without tape: it is the machine which is speaking: it is speaking
through us: it is a far cry from the turing machine: turing's cry:

of, somewhere along the line, the final go at it, the manuscript put
aside, the book completed, the philosophical argument temporarily term-
inated, the professor returns to her study, returns home, the professor
has a meal, go to sleep, dreams, the professor wakes in the morning,
decides just for once not to go to work this day,

doubt and deconstruction of conclusions. but whose doubt against what
standards and relativisms: what auguries of truth and denial: what obses-
sional neuroses: what ignorance, incoherencies: the autobiography of the
leap, short-circuiting or short-cutting ignorance, as if something could
be made out of whole cloth, there are always strategies of apology,
implications of humility, everything in the way, no clarity towards its
absence - theoretical weakening, weak theory, as the shifting behind the
scenes - think of the submerged philosophy of submergence in relation to
extruded theoretical abstraction, pronouncement, death and facticity - the
humility of the masochist: the transformation into substance: from there
the pronouncement of no pronouncement: there is no mirror, no dust: there
is no body:

the professor puts the manuscript of the sixth go aside, just for the
moment; the book "has almost completed itself," the book is "as finished
as it's going to be," "i've done with the book,"

the scientific as that methodology among others, in spite of heuristic
breakdowns and the problematic of mathematics. what crystalline mechanism
inherent of the tractatus-logico-philosophicus, what neoplatonism, what
conventions, inscriptive labor: retaining the last vestige of ontology,
giving existence a nearly-decomposable structure from groundwork to
lifeworld, superstructure disconnections, proliferations of objects,
elements, particles, things, organisms, universal constructs of contrasts
and boundaries, boundaries maintenance, the general economy of inscription
- episteme and ontology blurred - interpenetrations of regimes and domains
- conventionalisms and idealities both subject to the same dis/ease of
heuristic - bricolage or making-do in the world - this is hardly satisfac-
tory for anyone - this is hardly the case of the world - the case of the
world in relation then to the case of our being, dasein - the case of the
world in relation to dis/ease - but there is no case: there is no world
"such that it or that is the case": there is always the case that one does
or does not make: there is always the general case but never the most
general case:

the case comes to a close, the professor muses, at least at the sixth go
of it all, it's by and large, at least for the moment, i'm going to have a
breather,

the topology of intention and neurality in relation to externalized mind
and memory. but what privilege of data-banks, whose computers, whose
optical fiber, whose skein of satellites, what membranes and firewalls,
whose hackings and what penetrations: the future of networkings among
multi-taskings, virtual realities, information wars, incandescent sexual
hysterias, thickened communalities, and the relationships among these and
other futures vis-a-vis theoretical abstraction and general accounts of
cultural and universal creation - teledildonics and nodal bodies - voy-
eurisms and exhibitionisms as inversions or dissolutions of entities,
categoricities - the splayed or opened body - the body displaying or
opening - the w/hole of the body - disruption or perturbation of percep-
tion - the skeins of death and exhilaration - the splayed or opened
electric body: mesh of contacts: bridgings, spark-gaps, tesla coils,
stelarc-penetrations as flesh turns nebulous turns nebula: the absolute
revulsion against secrecy is also the revulsion against language and the
foreclosing of the signifier: bell's theorems as the body scatters: it's
kept in contact: it's kept in contact with the skein: with nothing: with
itself: with the semantics of foreclosed entities:

i'm going to enjoy myself after the fifth, before the seventh, she thinks
of the trajectory, of the content and indexicality of the book, of its
weight, the cover chosen by the publisher (an unknown chinese painting of
the sung dynasty), of the narrative faltering, almost bring the work "to
its knees,"

partial-objects and partial-mappings as givens in the construction and
reconstruction of the world. but of the gathering of accumulations and
assemblage of fragments, of the clutter and a-historicity of the world:
the disappearance of history, resonance of ideological tendencies among
historiographies, irrelevance of historical and theoretical recuperation,
the loss of the world among the world - the absolute loss of the world in
the future of the cosmos - writing/inscribing degree zero - the horizon of
the uselessness of organism - continuous eroding of transcendence -
grasping or cohering of imminence - loss of imminence:

of the sixth, here and now, of its inscription, it might be any of a
series, accounted for, the terms begin to blur, one into the other, each
revision another addition or edition, except for the punctuation, she
muses, you could hardly tell where one ends and the other begins,

loss of positionality: what is unaccounted-for: accountancy and the de-
marcation of nodes, direct and indirect addressing: a list of cases: if
not 1 then 2; if not to then 3; if not n then endif:

every content an indirect addressing, including the sixth, tending towards
those resonances already discussed, in which feedbacks collapse into
skeins of relationships,

the use of cases, examples, anecdotality, perceptual modes, in relation to
theoretical abstraction. what stories hidden with failures, ridden with
failures, gaps in texts, hiatus, ignorance: what negations (there are
none): what tales (they're all fiction): what parables (pretense!): and in
relation to the audience, what demographics following what core phenomena,
core metaphors, what one might tell you of an evening in miami with grack-
les scrabbling among scraps of food already evincing a symbolic construc-
ted among all of us in crude parody of heisenbergian sheffer-stroke quasi-
analytical approaches, as if the natural world were no longer problematic
but a gift towards the understanding - or now, outside this hotel room
#330 there are cartons of palm pdas on the landing - they have been there
all day - some are opened, people are taking them - i imagine, idiotic-
ally, vast supplies of drugs - they're payoff - everyone knows what's
going on - right outside the window here - taken fearlessly - personal
communications and informal economies - more and more networks opening up
- you can see all of this from the window - i've drawn the shades - maybe
witnesses conveniently disappear - imagination runs wild - one never knows
- she arches her body naked on the bed: there are people outside: her
holes are visible, open: she is speaking: "i am alan sondheim's beautiful
wife, welcome to miami": he is sitting naked, erect, on a chair, his face
covered with her panties: he's moaning: the sound resonates with the
tunnel reverberation effect in final cut pro: the camera cuts between the
two of them: cuts to apartment-houses, children playing: cuts to people
walking down a street: cuts to an office interior:

she's listening to him moan, she's completed the book, strangely excited
now, her mind drifting to other things after the sixth, he's her neurotic
husband, can hardly keep his mind focused, he's always falling apart,
always building worlds out of nothing, or nothing out of worlds, it's
beginning to make less and less of a difference, the virtual is descending
like a dark cloud, impenetrable, onto the subject, any subject, any human
being, she thinks,

exhaustion, defuge, and the wavering of existence in terms of the physical
well-being of the body, as well as the deconstruction of that well-being.
but what disease of the writer, what writing-disease: what textual wound-
ing: what ending to what written world: what semantics, what syntactic
endings: from indo-european to the absence of the subject in the sentence,
the absence of the eye and the shifter, the winding up of the winding-
sheet and loosening of the world from language in relation to or in spite
of natural kinds, rigid designators, performatives, proper names, who are
alan sondheim, daishin nikuko, who are julu-jennifer - what wounding of
informal economies - what disseminations - you can have any name you want
- take any gender - it's all there for the asking - nervously looking out
the window - who will be next - here in the motel room - what knocks on
the door - emptied hallways - strangely quiet around here - the camcorder
runs on: everything is broken up: entities, circulations created: here is
a thing now: this is the thing:

of the sixth of which this is all there is, the computer runs, the hard-
drive recoiling with entry after entry, the suppuration of the file
itself, what might have been canonically inert, now open in the digital to
eternal salvation on one hand, continuous change, revision, hacking, on
the other,

this is the first thing: this is the only thing there is:

of the sixth, almost the disappearance of the bones, of the bones, almost
the disappearance of the marrow, of the marrow, the disappearance of the
flesh,

but the dis/ease of writing - sound of keys - i can't stop this - the
living representation of information society - at work on the network -
gasping for breath on the network: holding our own on the network: a swarm
of us: groups of us:

groups of us writing through her, assembling the sixth go at it all, muted
conversation about the sixth, it's continuity and careful honing, we
arrive at everything through collaboration, discussion, you'd be surprised
at how few disagreements there are,

what writing: what loss of writing to the world: such presumption that
continuous production becomes closer to the thing, defines it, the "thing"
or "it" or production, that the model of labor creates and forecloses
among entities, that divisions and boundary phenomenology are somehow
riddled with existence - always honing in - always flying apart - them-
atic thickening, weakening - the philosophy in this book - this attempt or
collocation of thought - this process of thinking - a kind of jabbering
back and forth from systems of representation through structuralisms
always nearly-decomposable, bricolaged, falling apart - writing ground
down - inscription as well - into the abstraction of thought constantly
retethered - the thinking of the return - nomadic homing-in - corrals
prevent chaos: cages break down disseminations: locks contain spews: banks
hold back floods: muscle tension retains shit: "slips of the lips sink
ships":

she's opening herself up to herself for the first time, she thinks, now
that the work's done, now that i have myself, she's looking in the mirror,
naked, closely examining her body,

that of or within existence - that of the nought, cipher - of weyl's
cartesian origin as the last vestige of the ego in mathematization - you
can always locate from that point - sufficient vectors, orthogonal or not
- giving thought the substrate necessary for reading - writing - or is it
in fact necessary: consider a flooded reading, a reading without order:
phrases and fragments, resonances out of which a certain philosophic tone:
philosophy itself: emerges:

she thinks, i've stuttered everywhere among myself, i've felt my texts run
through me repeatedly, i've mouthed them insistently, i've cut crystal out
of them, i've brought them to their knees,

returning to the apparatus or partial-objects necessary for this - most
recently bought an antique glass pen - dip it in the ink, write for a
third of a page or so - hand-blown - here working with components made in
malaysia - the result of academic exchange - there are data-bases involved
- obsolescences - atavisms and dead media - prosthetics even in the
illumination of the screen (from before or behind) - what it is you are
reading "this" in - a whole system of temporary equivalences, technologies
- repetitions of databases - never forgetting a thing -

neither the fifth nor the fourth; neither the fourth nor the third; nei=
ther the third nor the second which, almost mewling, crept along the
theoretical substrate desperate for suturing, neither the second nor the
first, far too exposed, inverted, laying the groundwork, withdrawing
simultaneously, of a certain breathing of the text,

writing into this: section by section: paragraph by paragraph: each revi-
sion as if it were the last: the most important: each addition a more
careful construct: the work appearing from the inside-out: philosophy
unbound:

of the sixth go at it all, the revision or breathing of the text, she is
sleeping soundly for the first time in her life, there are small cells,
cancer, in her left breast, just a few of them, they are feeding,

In 2 Parts: Part I

2 cents about the poetics/politics of anthologies:

Um, I don't really think emailing Michael Waters to voice one's
displeasure with the 7th edition of Contemporary American Poetry is
very helpful.

Neither, though, am I going to buy one. The thrust of this anthology is
toward the introductory teaching of poetry, and the reigning method
of teaching poetry these days is through systematic cultural narratives,
driven by the parsonal "I". This anthology is fairly inclusive of
mainstream cultural practitioners of this period style. (I still can't
figure out why they dumped Mary Oliver though.) It's quite in line
with its target audience, I think.

I'm not in its target audience though. I still find the Norton Post
Modern anthology that Hoover edited to be the best for my uses.

In 2 Parts: Part II

I think we should all go out and spend our big tax refund checks on
anthologies like the Norton. In fact, I challenge all 900 or so members
of the POETICS list to pick two books of poetry and to go out and
buy them. Imagine selling 900 copies of a book of poetry. It might
even become popular . . . gads.

I suggest maybe Rae Armantrout's "Veil : New and Selected Poems"
which will be out soon?

Or maybe Anselm Hollo's "Notes on the Possibilities and Attractions
of Existence"?

What do you think? Make our anti-laureate a best seller?

Apologies for the long preamble.  Pierre's post has given
me opportunity to touch upon Larry's interview and Jeffrey's
attitude:

This is all utter nonsense.  What we are witnessing, what
we are enduring, is a new old-fogeyism: a fanatical, nostaligic
golden look back at our art, at all art.  These voices tell us,
"Sorry, kids, we had it great and you missed it."

Bullshit.  These voices tell us, "Poetry doesn't mean
what it used to, poets aren't as smart as they used to be,
our magazines were better, our poems were better, our
poets were better.  Our weed, our sex, our boys and our
girls--it was non-stop heaven."

Bullshit.  These voices tell us "We had greatness, we had
rythym, we have our Mt. Rushmore of poets, and now
we just need to stop."

Bullshit.  I don't think you had to be a white guy and
go to Harvard in the 1950's to be a poet in this country.

Do we need new poetry?  Yes.  Do we need new poetry
from you?  You decide.  Curl up with your favorite golden
oldies by the fire and remember how great it was, nobody's
stopping you.  The rest of us will be writing.

Mom and Dad, I'm glad you don't like my music.  It's 9:30,
why don't you go to bed now?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Not all caught up yet jumping in...

I've been thinking about the mystery of editing, which in my opinion Patrick
and Jim have referred to. There's just no way to know entirely what's
happening and to glean all the tactics and powers of what's going on in
literature in one's own time or perhaps any time (this goes perhaps to
Kasey's GREAT post). And who would want to. Thus I do like to try to include
a variety, or at least to be OPEN as an editor. I hope there is more talk of
that. To listen to the weather, and hope not to end up as corny as the local
weatherperson. Editing by manifestoes would be to me like assuming it will
rain all of November in the Bay Area, tho it hasn't since I was in high
school, and reporting that no matter what really occurred.

One reason we use themes at Outlet is to help in the editorial decision
making process; and another way of being OPEN is sharing these decisions
with co-editors, tho I admit as the pubber I do take my own direction most
often (tho I don't live by manifesto, even tho I am seen in some quarters as
a raging feminist). Another reason is that having a theme, it seems to me,
helps in readers who are perhaps not schooled or opinionated in the exact
same readerly pattern or curiosity as me. My hope is that's a way to let
them into the reading of some of the more experimental work we publish.

As far as rejecting solicited work, and this is just as advice to anyone in
the thick of it, I have tried to either a.) ask for a specific piece I've
just heard someone read or b.) ask for work from someone who I am confident,
thru extensive reading of their work, that I'll be able to pick say at least
one of three things they send me.

And on the topic of MOMS, I don't disagree with anything Laurie or Rachel
said, but I would add that in my days I've seen moms respected in ways that
no one else is, and that has seemed right to me. I of course have also seen
them disrespected in ways no one else is. This seems proper at times too, on
an individual, not a cultural, level. To disrespect moms and women on a
cultural level is basically the road to hell in a handbasket, if you believe
in the phrasing.

As for the talk of a certain pop star, I would think the last name might be
a hint as to her "ethnicity"; not necessarily a label of fact, but a hint,
and I think Dodie's point was quite well taken.

Cheers all,
Elizabeth

Please forward this message.

Get Tinfish "textbooks" for the coming semester!!!

Please consider teaching Tinfish Press books this semester, or next. The =
books have been taught in at least half a dozen classes at the =
University of Hawai`i and UC Santa Cruz. Here are some possibilities:

If you're teaching a class in prose poetry or the elegy, try Bill =
Luoma's Dear Dad ($5).

Designed by Gaye Chan.

Teaching the sonnet? Nell Altizer's Thin Space is a sequence about a =
love affair in Ireland between two persons over 60 ($5). Designed by =
Suzanne Kosanke.

If you're interested in gay and lesbian OR Asian American studies OR in =
the prose poem, try Lisa Asagi and Gaye Chan's Physics and 12 Scenes of =
12 a.m. (2 for $7: they fold out as exquisitely designed maps).

If you teach Pacific Rim studies or Australian and American poetry, use =
Rob Wilson's Pacific Postmodern ($5). Designed by KC Mah.

If language issues catch your fancy, order up Lisa Kanae's forthcoming =
(soon!), Sista Tongue, an essay/memoir about speaking pidgin (Hawai`i =
Creole English). Incredible design work by Kristin Gonzales. Unpriced =
yet. I expect them in about a month.

I still have some copies of Kathy Banggo's 4-evaz, Anna, as well ($5), =
in its third edition.

I would be happy to send out sample teaching copies of any of these =
books. Just send an email message to me.

Expect Tinfish 11 in the near future with a new art centerfold and =
one-of-a-kind covers (as usual)..and Three Vietnamese Poets in =
Translation, by Linh Dinh. Both designed by Stuart Henley.

Thanks, Susan Schultz

Hi Aaron,

The question for me is not so much whether temporal durability is a
legitimate measure (or "principle" is the word you use--almost like using
the "test of time" as a definition of good art is a moral stance) of good
poetry, but why poets (and, therefore, supposedly, "active" readers) would
want to use it as such? It seems like the most extremely dull (as well as
unreliable) way to gauge good poetry, only to be used if you're stuck at the
very last moment for something to teach your students (i.e., Here kids,
here's the oldest texts I found still in print! Assyrian-Babylonian stone
tablets listing olive oil sales! Pop quiz at the end of class!).

I mean, what is the "test of time" anyhow? Some sort of mathematical model
of greatest popularity (and do we mean popular with critics? The masses?)
plus durability of physical materials over longest length of time? X times Y
equals = Great Art that Has Meaning & Significance for Many (European?
American?) Generations?

best,
M (Letting her assessment of a principle be overwhelmed with questions)

Sardonic (and right-on) nature of this post aside, the National Writers
Union does have a poetry division. While, unfortunately, the issue of
boycotting contests rarely, if ever, arises (matter of fact, they hold a
contest of their own once a year, I believe), they do offer such useful
services as contract advice and health insurance.

On the journalism front, they are currently waging an all-out war against
none other than the New York Times and, now, AOL/Time Warner -- and winning!
Tasini v. New York Times held that freelance writers must be paid for
electronic reproduction of their work. In response the NYT has threatened to
pull freelance writers' work from all electronic databases rather than pay
them their due.  The union is also fighting AOLTW's new work-for-hire
contract, a convention all too common in this field.

Jacques,  I wanted to respond to your "I was a bad poet" post which was,
as always, provocative.  What follows may at times seem a bit harshly
critical, I don't know -- anyway it's said with confidence in our
friendship, a belief in its public usefulness (and a dislike of
backchanneling) and, most of all, a desire that you not stop writing
poems.


Taste still seems to me a wholly negative term and concept ÐÐ and though
you're no doubt right that the critique of taste has made possible a
relativistic laziness and its concomitant apology, this fact doesn't stand
as a convincing argument for taste.  The problem with taste (as I tried to
outline in my editor's note to COMBO 8 and more recently on the
"New-Poetry" list) is that it's obscurantist by nature: "I simply prefer
good art to bad," as Greenberg put it.  Negatively inflected innovation
may in the end be bullshit but its bullshit of a much higher quality than
Greenberg's.  And you give everyone way too much credit when you suggest
that "no one takes their own hierarchies of taste for granted anymore" --
at the risk of pissing you off I'd suggest that this view might be a sign
of your own insularity more than anything else.  Likewise Ashbery's
"Everybody today is avant-garde" (if that's the precise quote) seems to me
an empty truism, my love for Ashbery notwithstanding.  My experience with
poets involved in (as teachers, students, alums), let's say,
non-experimentally inclined MFA programs, is that they mystify "Language
Poetry" into something close to witchcraft ("You're not a language poet,
are you," is something I've heard more than once.)  This isn't the fault
of any one person, it's simply the consequence of coersion, exclusivity --
things you'd find, incidentally, in experimental poetry communities too.
I'll say it again: the people who hate X or Y poetry/poets do so as a
result of *some* process of institutionalization.  Everyone else is either
indifferent, or, luck of luck, runs into a poem which becomes an
experience-of-reading outside the bounds of taste.  That process is
multifarious indeed.  And I simply reject the notion that, say, Perelman's
"Captive Audience" is somehow an unreadable document or unpleasurable
outside the bonds of its theoretical frame.

Which brings me back to taste: I agree with you, whole heartedly, that
poets need "the capacity to bear down," though I'd disagree, somewhat,
with the nostalgic suggestion that this is something "poetry can't seem to
stand up to anymore" -- that's a complaint found decade after decade into
the fog of prehistory.  I would prefer to replace a term like taste with
something suggesting effort, -- ambitious-ness as distinct from ambition,
somehow: like what Creeley said about the Black Arts writers: "they are
not fooling, so to speak, and their action tends to follow the literal
path of their commitment."  It seems to me that what needs to be queried
by readers (and writers) of poetry is the nature of that commitment -- the
question of what a poem is designed to do (or in any event what it does)
for a poet and her audience.  Also what it might potentially do (here the
question of design is important).  This replaces taste for me: instead of
"I like what's good" you get "I like the poem that does this becauseÉ" The
explanation may be ridiculous, the reading of the poem limited,
self-willed, whathaveyou; but it will inevitably invite a response and a
dialogue and this is a distinct advantage over Greenbergian elitist
transparency.

The idea that the poem designed to encourage an "ethically beautiful
experience of community an collaboration" can't be "great art," that the
two practices are mutually exclusive -- well, it just seems to fly in the
face of much evidence to the contrary to me.  Baraka's AM/TRAK is both;
Dickinson's poetry is both, etc etc etc.  I think the problem more central
to your concerns is "fashion" -- by which I take you to mean the poem
designed to gain cultural capital for the poet.  At times you seem to
suggest, despairingly and with Bourdieu very much in mind, that this is in
fact all a poem ever does, and that any other explanation for its being is
mere apology.  Perhaps I'm misrepresenting you, but whether you believe it
or not it's to my mind a bad reading of Bourdieu and in any event not a
fruitful way to think about the making of poems.

I myself sometimes want to write a poem as ridiculously sincere as an ABBA
song (say, "SOS" rather than "Dancing Queen").  But I don't do it, I take
a bigger risk.  There's always room for ABBA afterward.

how many magazine editors out there actually take an "editorial"
approach towards submitted poetry/fiction beyond just "accept/reject"?

how would this be like/unlike workshopping? if you've done it how was it
received? (nonfiction writers, tho not exactly "receptive" are prolly
moreso to this?)

I spent a few years professionally as an editor and had the pleasure of
working under a really damn good one. When he was done editing a piece
it was as if he was never there. I think that is the key: to me, a good
editor is basically a translator in some ways; throw in a dash of method
actor as well

There are cases where this doesn't apply, there are cases where it does;
and in all cases it should serve to blur any old ideas of authorship;
and may dig up some unsettling "what I said" v. "what I meant" threads
(substitute "the text" or "the writing" for "I" if that makes it
easier/harder)

Of course, this kind of engaging editorialship will just aggravate the
afore-mentioned "time problem" all editors are facing as manuscript upon
manuscript rolls in, but to me that engagement was always the editorial
fun/reward whether the piece be poetry or an op-ed on US arms transfer
policies

put everything above together and I guess the mark of a good editor
shouldn't be seen? but then again I'm not talking about any of the
'herding' or 'gathering' that started the whole post? you want the
reverse of good editing: take a look at the fourth harry potter or any
other mainstream book that is being rushed to make the spring/fall
publishing list...

asides: editing stories/urban myths(?):
>>Catch-22 was edited for more than two years before publishing. At one point the editor had his assistant type all the books sentences onto little slips of paper and he rearranged the whole deal.
>>An editor once suggested a new title for one of Graham Greene's books. His response was a brief note: Easier to change publishers than title.

Jim -

I don't think Jacques was saying that the new poetry is all crud.  What I
think he was saying is that perhaps poems improve with age, and at the same,
our contemporary culture find new ways to value crap.

I also think jacques was suggesting that tastes are a function of time,
which would explain Fagin's grumble.  It appears that Fagin has little
awareness of his own values in a broader context.  That is, his tastes do
not reflect an acknowledgement of the indifferent passage of time.  Fagin
also seems to miss the possibility that maybe his own criteria, over his
lifespan, have probably become more stringent, and maybe they were even so
stringent that label "good poetry" was restricted to certain pre-approved
members.   And so, if his criteria become more stringent & time passes, then
emerging poets (which are eternal; there's always an emerging poet
somewhere) seem crappier and crappier, and fewer and fewer of the members of
his pre-approved club are alive.  So from his less mindful perspective,
poetry gets worse.  Perhaps Fagin's comments reflect the painful struggle we
all face as we get older, the difficult battle to remember.  In fighting
this battle we often place the bodies of these old memories in new outfits
just to keep them in the room, so-to-speak.  the problem is that we end up
with memories that are not, well, very accurate.

One needs to be aware of his or her own tastes, but one must also be able to
see the range of tastes as well, see ones place in that range.  And if a
person can do that, and imagine new possibilities for tastes, well, then
something very interesting can happen.

Right on!  It IS utter nonsense.  But have compassion for the old fogeyism,
and prepare yourself for the possibility one day you will too dress old
memories in new clothes.  And keep in mind that the folks at Harvard make
things so, whether we like it or not.  They even have a "philosopher" on
faculty, Robert Nozick, that articulates and espouses this very Harvard
"philosophy," namely, that people can be more real by virtue of how
well-known they are.  Yes, Harvard University "believes" (as only an
institution can believe) you are less real than Robert Nozick.  The Ivies
will always have the market on poetic greatness cornered.  (This doesn't
mean Harvard is full of crud or anything and all its people are bad; the
University does possess an unusual concentration of legitimately intelligent
folks and ambitious achievers along with its unusual concentration of landed
wealth.)

There was some slippage of this notion of Ivy greatness for a brief while in
our history, but then America found itself again in Reagan, Springsteen's
"Born in the USA," and the Christian Coalition, so now everything is back to
the way "it should be" with a clearly inbred descendant of King Henry III in
the White House.  The Vanderbilts and the Pratts and the Whitneys and the
Harrimans and the Bushes and Cliffords and Lovetts and so on can once again
use New England institutions to obfuscate the illegitimacy of their wealth,
bathing the crimes of their past in part with a pool of similarly
romanticized and blind old-timey poetry, ensuring that no one living will
get to them or their wealth.  They know that just as they stole that wealth
so too it can be stolen from them.  So they will continue to decide what is
real, what is good.  The structure of the poetic food chain is safe once
again.  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, and if you can't join 'em, shout
really loudly, shout over these powerful voices, work as hard as twenty
people, and keep the effort up for a long long time.  That way we'll all be
better off.  One less credential, twenty times more glory.

Last night I heard an "explanation" for Vermeer's "genius": in and around
Delft was a great deal of old money and inherited wealth.  Of course this
view was provided my an effete museum's curator, no doubt either a part of
the old money himself, or at least clearly completely subject to it.
Elitist views are everywhere, but do not let them get you down.  It is
nonsense, and it should go without saying.  Sadly, however, it does not and
so that explains my rambling.

By the way, I believe Fagin's a Terrapin, so he's quite un-Harvard I think.
But what's scary is that he has this fogey attitude, and yet once upon a
recent time he was director of the Naropa Program.  Rather unenlightened
sounding for a Buddhist.  Maybe he was just having a bad day when he gave
the interview or maybe the years have not been so kind.

I just learned that Greenwood Press has published an edition of Melvin B.
Tolson's M.A. Thesis on writers of the Harlem Renaissance.  The scholarship
on this subject has moved on considerably since Tolson's time, but his was
one of the first such studies, and it reveals a great deal of interest to
readers of Tolson.  It's pricey at $55.00 -- but get your library to buy one!

Unless he doesn't realize what a moron he is.  In which case, alerting
him to the fact might get him to investigate contemporary American
poetry, and do a better job if he ever gets to edit another anthology.

Alas, the problem with this is that the Hoover anthology is to some of
us what the Michael Waters anthology is to Jim Behrle.  Alas #2, there
still isn't an anthology out worth spending a dime on for those
interested in what of significance has been happening in poetry since
1980 or so.

 dear jacques,
           trouble is giving up poetry is an old avant-garde move.
so my question would be, what are you doing instead? I presume writing
of some kind, or are you going to a nunnery?

           Isn't Polke a better reference point than you are allowing; his
badness has proved extraordinarily rich, not forms of something less, but of
something more. Are you (we) tangled up in genealogy?  The 'poetry is
finished' argument is common enough,  it comes from defenders of
conventional  poetry offended by avant-garde poetry, so entirely beside the
point of yours. In the art world it produced some pieces I still find
useful--de Duve's Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow, Blue?
notably--about how to be avant-garde without being avant-garde, and about
the impossibility of post-modernity.

Subject: Why I was a bad poet (was: greatness; editors, editing, etc.)


At one time I had the stupid idea that it would be possible to write poems
persuasively in an impoverished idiom which--even though it was deliberately
crude, trivial, ironically effortless, etc.--would possess a badness that
would be somehow analogous to the sophisticated, expressive badness of
paintings by visual artists like Sigmar Polke and Picabia--an aesthetic
that,
by the way, is almost a cliche in the art world.

Now there are a lot of reasons why, as I say, I was being stupid.  But
fundamentally it was a redundant idea.  My biggest mistake was not to see
that alternative, av-garde--whatever-you want-to-call-it--poetry is already
(by definition) bad.  I don't mean this in a pejorative sense necessarily,
but it should be obvious that strategems of subversion (or fashion) are
always immediately launched by calculated outrages against conventional
taste.

Everybody today, as Ashbery insists somewhere, is avant-garde.  There are
New
Formalists, of course, and neo-Confessionalists, and so on, but no one takes
their own heirarchies of taste for granted anymore, or views these as
self-evident or natural (though the degree to which taste is seen to be
subjective or objective varies of course along a wide continuum).

Get rid of all of the fetishes, dogmas--the excrescences that accumulate
around art--and describe the nature of poetry *qua* poetry.
Ok--Indefinability--indescribability, even--are paradoxically givens.  But
it's the very experience of a poem--its affect (indescribable or
not)--considered as an end in itself--that is poetry's ultimate value:  not
cognition, as C. Greenerg writes, but cognitiveness.

I'm not expressing this very well;  this is just a post to a listserv--no
one
will get thru the whole thing and, still, I'm only telegraphing my point.
But  I'm trying i suppose to set up an opposition:  that is, while poetry
qua
poetry resolves, as I said, essentially around the experience of poetry as
an
end in itself (an experience which is reflexively judgemental:  i.e. "this
(poem) is worth my attention or not"-- and so dependent on judgements of
taste), at the same time the heirarchies of taste have been effectively
undermined (for all poets, exp or not) by the av-garde.

What have been the strategies of this subversion?  My second big mistake,
you
see, was to take for granted that experimental poetry outrages taste by the
renunciations it makes.  Its innovations are always a form of something
less:
  less narrative, less syntax, less beauty, less structure, less metaphor,
etc., etc.  But there comes a point, you know, when saying that you like
"bad" poetry, or that you want poetry to share the condition of dirt (as
Nate
Dorward, I think, recently said to me), or that boring is better, or that
the
politics, not the quality of a poem, are what's essential--there comes a
point when these kinds of things become only a form of bullshitting oneself.
**Without taste, there's no such thing as poetry.**  Mike and Kasey, I get
and follow yr point, but the whole problem w/ contemporary poetry is the
evasion of the highest expectations and the heaviest pressures of taste.

**Even if the "best" can never be adequately or universally determined for
everybody (of course not),  you still have to constantly ask this of
_yourself_.  That is, you either take responsibility for your own taste, or
you don't.   Which is exactly the opposite of submitting to received ideas.

But this is precisely the pressure --the capacity to bear down --that poets
and  poetry can't seem to stand up to anymore--av-garde or otherwise.  There
are many talented and brilliant poets--and there are many poems to like---
but the medium they've inherited--as well as the social position of poetry's
invisiblity-- is too impoverished to accomplish anything that's not minor.
**(I mean it's important to realize that even the so-called conventional
poetries have systematically stripped themselves of the genre's traditional
resources.)**   For alt poetries, the most successful recourse (in certain
precincts of the academy) has been a kind of exquisitist writing--Palmer,
Guest, Lauterbach, Cole Swenson, Peter Gizzi, and so on--comparable in a way
to the turn in the editorial direction that Sun & Moon eventually made.
It's
often brilliant stuff, but it  also manages to be both anemic and somehow
too
rich.  You'll starve on a steady diet, but throw it against the wall and it
will stick.

What's left, on the one hand, is fashion--which is entirely what is being
invoked by the constant rhetoric on this list of "new," "emerging,"
"younger," poets, editors, readers, academics, blah, blah, blah.  On the
other hand, the evasion of and the resentment against the demands of taste
make possible, I admit, an ethically beautiful experience of community and
collaboration.  The value of this is at least as great as making "great"
art,
but you should be aware at least that you're not--you can't be-- doing both
at the same time.  The way I've settled it for myself is to stop writing
poetry.


In a way, the academy--the theoretical wing-- left the LangPos way behind.
As Perloff suggested a while back, the aesthetic does not have any special
value for cultural theorists.  What wss impt about LP were the manifestos
(irrespective really of whether they were right or wrong);  the LPs never
were in any theoretical position to promote the poetry *as* poetry, though
of
course this is what they can't help doing.  The impasse is symptomatic of
the
evasion of taste.

Bill Luoma's _My Trip to New York City_ is really the bad book that I wanted
to write.  Unintentionally, perhaps, he exposes the way that poetry is made
now:  as a matter of fashion and community--cliquish, humane, competitive
(but unambitious).  And dumb.   And bad, most of all.

Marcella:

1.  To say that I admire and appreciate your stance on ~everything.~  You seem
like one of the most consistent perspectives I hear of these days.  I'm glad you
can still use the word "capitalist" (as glad Yiddish survives).

2.  I was likewise impressed by your "performance" on Fence's Housing Works
Literary Magazine Benefit panel, several months ago.  (Thanks, Fence.)  Standing
your ground against the likes of George Plimpton and that other Tin House (sp?)
editor was a much-needed foil.  I took notes at that session.  The transcripts
are below (defective, unable to read my own handwriting at points, and I think
they may be in reverse chronological order).

I spent a few years studying cuneiform and working on a paleoeconomics research
project measuring the price fluctuations in six Assyrian commodities over a 600
year span (barley, cress, dates, . . .).  It's very savvy of you to betray that
you know clay tablets were indeed principally a record of sales--- but olive
~oil~ is an invoice I do not recall ever seeing.

Armand Schwerner's THE TABLETS are remarkably truthful in conveying what it's
like to struggle with reading cuneiform.  (And Sumerian tablets are older than
Assyrian/Akkadian-Babylonian.)

{Please note: I have nothing against George Plimpton, personally.  Many years
ago, when I did an interview with James Schuyler, Geoffrey Young of The Figures
Press told me that Plimpton and the Paris Review had been trying to get an
interview with Schuyler for years,--- but unsuccessfully.  So, I looked up
Plimpton's telephone number in Manhattan White Pages and phoned him.   He was
home and picked up the phone.  I also had an 11-page partial transcript of an
interview with Harry Mathews.  Plimpton said he would enjoying reading both.
Sent him them.  Later, proper etiquette of handwritten thank you follow-up on
Paris Review stationery, I guess. --- It's just that he and Tin House becomes so
dialectically opposed to Marcella and the MENSA genius, that their mercantile
values appeared all the more caricaturish in contrast to Durand/MENSA Tarot
Reader's altruistic authenticity.}

September 2001 -- Back to School with Small Press Traffic!

Friday, September 7, 2001
6 p.m. : Reception celebrating our Archive
7:30 p.m.: Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge & Chris Tysh

Welcome to fall 2001 at Small Press Traffic! We begin tonight with a gala
evening. At 6 we host a reception celebrating our Archive’s new home at
Simpson Library, CCAC. At 7:30, a reading by luminous poets Mei-Mei
Berssenbrugge & Chris Tysh. Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge was born in Beijing  and
grew up in  Massachusetts. Her books include The Heat Bird (Burning Deck,
winner of an American Book Award), Empathy (Station Hill), and Four Year
Old Girl (Kelsey Street). Her collaborations include artists books with
Richard Tuttle and Kiki Smith, and theatre works with Frank Chin, Blondell
Cummings, Tan Dun, Shi Zhen Chen and Alvin Lucier. She has been a
contributing editor of Conjunctions magazine since 1978, and has taught at
Brown University and the Institute of American Indian Arts. Once an
associate of Georgia O'Keefe, she is active in both Native and Asian
American cultural movements, and recently read at the UN. Chris Tysh is
currently working on a film script based on the works of Bataille; her new
book is Continuity Girl. Previous works include Porne, Secrets of
Elegance, and Coat of Arms, the last of which includes prose poems
investigating the semi-ancient arts of heraldry and femininity. Lyn
Hejinian says of Coat of Arms: “The very fact that we call heraldic
symbols ‘devices’ makes them vulnerable to another realm -- the poetic --
where prerogatives can be rethought and ultimately dispersed. Tysh's
writing doesn’t say we shouldn't be somewhere, but it acts out a being
there in a different (gorgeous and unpunishing) way.”


Friday, September 14, 2001 at 7:30 p.m.
David Larsen & Fred Moten

Two investigators of geography and language will read no doubt with
surprises. Oakland resident David Larsen is a performer, artist, scholar,
and poet --  a mover, shaker and maker the Bay Area is lucky to call its
own. His poetry has appeared in Cello Entry, Mirage #4/Period(ical),
Explosive, and other magazines, as well as the chapbooks To The Fremont
Station, Sepia #1-7, and Swath.   He presented “Scarcely Otherwise: Kevin
Killian’s Pulp Mimesis” at the Queer/Popular/Culture conference in Santa
Cruz last March. With Beth Murray he edited the much-missed San Jose
Manual of Style. His artworks have graced many small press books and
journals, and new cartoon work is due out in Chain. Fred Moten is the
author of Arkansas  (Pressed Wafer, 2000), a collection of poems which
Michael Palmer says: “reminds us that no vital sense of community can be
separated from its confusions and contentions and its ardent affirmations,
just as no poetry of worth can settle for the easy assuagements of the
given. It reminds us as well that in poetry the orial and the textural
interweave to create a new language, a personal grammar illuminating the
actual.”  Originally from Las Vegas and Arkansas, Moten currently lives in
NYC where he teaches in the Department of Performance Studies at the Tisch
School of the Arts, NYU.  His next book, Ensemble & Improvisation: The
Political Erotics of the Black Avant-Garde , is due out from the
University of Minnesota Press. Both of these writers have unlocked secrets
of the Bay Area with their linguistics and lingos; we natives are always
glad to see BART, Latrell Sprewell and Chez Panisse mentioned in poems! We
are eager to see what they each surprise us with next!

Just added -- Sunday, September 23, 2001 at Diesel Books in Oakland. SPT
cosponsors a release party for the new magazine nocturne, edited by
giovanni singleton.

Crosstown Traffic

The season opener of our multimedia series, featuring text, music, and
visual art -- sure to be a gala event and to get you set for more
multimedia explorations throughout the year. Artist David Huffman , a
Berkeley native and CCAC MFA grad, will present and discuss his work, and
the musical group Positive Knowledge will perform. Huffman had a solo
exhibition at Patricia Sweetow Gallery last year and his work has appeared
in group shows at the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Hokkaido Museum in
Japan, and San Francisco’s own Yerba Buena Center. Positive Knowledge is
Oluyemi Thomas, reed instruments, and Ijeoma Thomas, poetic vocals, plus
special guests. Their CDs include Invocation #9, recorded at Yoshi’s, and
last year's At the Center of the Threshold, the recording debut of their
East Coast incarnation. Crosstown Traffic is curated by the writers and
SPT board members Taylor Brady and Yedda Morrison.

Please note, Jim, I never say, "ours is the worst age." In fact I never
implied anything near your interpretation of my statement.  I believe that
it is likely every age has been as bad as the last.  Darkness sinks eternal.
I might be an old fogey, but certainly not because of what you imagine I
wrote.  One may be able to find bad poetry from any age, or poor art from
any age.  Good poetry is all around us today.  *Wondrous,* *marvelous,*
"blow your head off" poetry is a rare event and *always* has been.  I do
reserve the right to make judgments about my own inclinations.  I do not
love every piece of poetry I read, and I'm sure that you don't either.  Much
of what I find is not very good.  (You should come to a poetry reading in
Chapel Hill, NC, and then you would really understand what I'm talking
about.)  ;^)

As I've said, as I've worked harder to find inspired contemporary poetry,
I've found it.  It exists.  It's right there in my quote that you snipped.
I hardly agree with Fagin.

Best,
Patrick

Hey Jim, Wystan,

Jim--it's humiliating to be called Pierre after we've been out drinking 1/2 a
dozen times together & you've published me in _canihaveyr_. . . .   But I do
tend to be socially recessive, so I think I can understand.  Anyway here's
what I think about yr posts.  Fagin's poetry, to my mind, isn't any better
than the best poetry being written right now--often by people in their 20s
(though a lot of the time I don't know how old the poets are  who write the
poems I like).  In fact, I almost always find tons of things to enjoy in the
poetry zines I pick up.

What Fagin--& what the other poets of his generation--are expressing, I
think, is the feeling that they've been passed over w/out having been given
their shot.   Do they deserve that?  For me--make up yr own mind--there's a
drop-off immediately after the 1st gen NY School.  & it tracks closely w/ the
decline in the cultural  status of poetry.  But that doesn't start in the
1960s--as Perloff said someplace recently (& I agree w/ her), O'Hara ain't no
T.S. Eliot.  So as to which gen of epigones is superior--yrs or Fagin's--who
knows?  Apart from the my vs. yr generational tenor of his comments I  think
that he's pretty sharp about the derivativeness of the kinds of things you'll
see in the NYC zines.

Ok--so if I say you should aspire to write as well as Stevens & Eliot--or
let's get even more ridiculous--Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, Dante, etc.--how
could you do it?  YOU CAN'T.  The instrument's broken.  Why should artistic
genres have an infinite lifespan?

When Fagin says that the payoff for writing poetry is inconsequential, I tend
to believe him.  Jim, do you think that by yr generational logic yr poetry is
going to get the shot at some wider attention than his got?  I think it's
maybe better to think for oneself than to think for one's generation (an
impossibe burden).  That's how to begin at least to talk honestly to oneself
about art--something tremendously difficult to do.

Wystan,

Polke is for me still a terrific & inspiring artist--my problem was that i
made too easy analogies across generic boundaries.  Greenberg thru de Duve is
as you know an interest of mine.  & my end of poetry rants track w/ danto's
end of art screeds to some extent.  Maybe we can flesh this out sometime if
it interests you.

Jacques, I think that many interesting writing projects have been
born of excess--like Bataille, who, I believe Rosemarie Waldrop
brought up this past year on the list.  Thank you, Rosemarie.  Excess
is very important in much female writing as a transgressive strategy,
such as Kathy Acker.

It seems to me that your astute analysis isn't of all avant-garde
writing, but of writing that has no political or personal urgency.
To me, it sounds like this "exquisitist" writing is the writing of
the bored.

According to Jacques Debrot:
>

> 1960s--as Perloff said someplace recently (& I agree w/ her), O'Hara ain't no
> T.S. Eliot.

Jacques, if either you or Perloff mean by this that O'Hara's poetry never
enjoyed (or will enjoy?) the cultural status of Eliot's poetry, well then,
perhaps (tho I'd rather not bet on the future).  If, on the other hand,
either of you mean by this that Eliot's poetry is somehow "better" than
O'Hara's, the I would ask: better for who? and for what?  If the idea
is that it's better for some transcendental or epiphanic art-experience, I
ain't havin' it.  In fact, let me entertain an outrageous proposition,
pretending, just for the sake of argument, that I can make judgments
based solely on good aesthetic taste: not only is O'Hara a much better
poet than Eliot, Eliot isn't even that great.  Reading your post, I went
back to thee Wasteland for the 394th time to confirm something I've been
thinking for about 2 years: namely, that it must have been pretty easy to
write.  It strikes me as about what a very smart turn-of-the-century
Harvard alum with a good ear, a good library and a good editor could pull
off.  I can see just how it was manufactured, what resources were drawn
upon, the logic of it, etc.  If we really want to talk about sublimity,
then the intelligible-ness of The Wasteland renders it rather un-sublime
for me.  It's nice, interesting, but surprisingly paint-by-numbers when
you get right down to it.  In contrast, I can't really fathom how O'Hara
wrote "Ode to Mike Goldberg ('s Birth and Other Births)" or for that
matter, how there came to be a Frank O'Hara in the first place.  And in
modernism I'll take Zukofsky's "A" or "Tender Buttons." We agree on
Stevens.  But in fact to talk in this way is to avoid/evade my major
point, which is that to discuss sublimity as an experience-of-reading, or
experinece-of-writing, without accepting the burden of explaining why that
experience might be desired, and even of use, is to shirk one's
responsibilities.  Lowell and Berryman had a list of "greatest" poets
which they were constantly adjusting, slowly moving themselves up the
latter - that's ambitious, in its way, but they should have been paying
more attention to the way the wind was blowing and reading less TS Eliot.

To all addressees, please include this notice in your upcoming media
listings and arts events planning. This is a launch and a group of writers
not to be missed.


Who says books aren't exciting??

Thank you,
Glenn Nuotio
(please see  below)
___________________________________________________________________

The Limited Ink Writers Collective invite you to the launch and a reading of
NINE , a new "book-machine" of new St. John's writing, beginning at NINE
p.m. on
Tuesday August 28th, 2001 at
Steel Mountain Records Bar,
252 Water Street ,
St. John's.

Blending text, image, book design, and poetry, "Nine" is created by nine
writers who are among the best in an emerging generation of new Newfoundland
writers.

With works by Ana Natoli, Andrea Cooper, Kevin Angelo Hehir, Sandra Cowan,
Batia Boe Stolar, Elizabeth Mackenzie, Matthew Cook, Benjamin Evans, and
Douglas Ivison, 'NINE' is a book-machine in that it acts as a fold-out book,
constructed with a stainless steel cover, and is "operated as much as it is
read".

Copies of "NINE" have been constructed by the collective and are in limited
supply of only 150 copies. Many of these have already been pre-sold, but the
collective's innovative book-machine will be officially launched and sold at
Steel Mountain Bar on Tuesday August 28th.

The writers will be in attendance and will read from their works. There is
no admission charge and everyone is invited to attend.

I like a lot of New York magazines, I think
it's wrong to keep dismissing the work that's
published there, much of which is worth a look.

I know nothing about Fagin's poetry. I have
nothing against him and his generation of poets.
I'm against his need to dismiss and ridicule
everyone who didn't grow old with him.

I respect, but don't want to write like any of
those guys. I want to write my poems.  If you're
saying my work's broken, my work sucks, I don't
have the skills to write, fine.

I like my stuff.  Do you have to write like
those guys to write poetry?  I mean, what has the
last 50 years of American Poetry been about?

I think poetry should get out of the king-making
business.  Sure there's lots of us, lots of voices.
This is not a bad thing.  I do think for myself:
my problem is, many are eager to dismiss all poets
under the age of 60.  And why is it important that my
work receive "wider attention?"  Why can't I be
one of a pack of great writers, if I deserve it?

I admire many young poets: Ange Mlinko, Daniel Bouchard,
Jordan Davis, Lisa Jarnot, Anselm Berrigan, Del Ray Cross,
Brenda Coultas, Sean Cole, Thalia Field, Hoa Nguyen,
Aaron Kiely, Rachel Levitsky, Heather Fuller, Prageeta Sharma,
Edmund Berrigan, Joseph Lease, Brendan Lorber, Chris Stroffolino, Joseph
Lease, Jason Zuzga, Donna de la Perriere, Dale Smith, Beth Woodcome, John
Mulrooney, Jessie Stickler, Cate Marvin, Arielle Greenberg, Rebecca Wolff,
Jim Dunn, Fred Moten, Laura Mullen, Nada Gordon, Michael Magee, Jumper
Bloom, Wanda Phipps, Elliza McGrand, Brenda Iijima, Mike County, Beth
Anderson, Marcella Durand, Mitch Highfill, Nathan Hauke, Matvei Yankelevich,
Thomas Sayers Ellis, Juliana Spahr, Bill Louma, Mike Bucell, Tom Devaney,
Camille Martin, Summi Kaipa, Lisa Lubasch, Max Winter, Heather Ramsdell,
Kristin Prevellat, Karen Weiser, Macgregor Card, Aaryn Richard, Dana Ward,
Beth Simon, Buck Downs, Elena Rivera, Bill Alegreeza, Joel Chance, Katie
Degentish, Trane Devore, Benjamin Friedlander, Kate Lutzner, Kevin Grant,
Aaron Belz, Daisy Fried, Dodie Bellamy, Dietmar Kirk Krumrey, Jeni Olin,

Foster, Renee Gladman, Lee Ann Brown,
Peter Gizzi, Harryette Mullen, Edwin Torres, Cedar Sigo, Betsy Fagin,
Elizabeth Treadwell, Mary Burger, Magdelena Zurawski, Katy Lederer,  and
many, many more.

That's almost 100 younger poets--those are only
the ones I know and can think of this second
(sorry if I've forgotten you, I will kick myself in
the morning).  There are a billion more who are
writing exciting poetry.

Moan, you moaners, but the kids are alright.

--Jim

PS: I'm looking forward to getting turned on to more
poets, young and old.  I ask the list--who are poets
I should be reading?

I was especially taken by Jacques' (pronounced "Zha-KEEZ", as in Shakespeare's
"As You Like It, yes?) confession, "The way I've settled it for myself is to stop
writing poetry".  And I was somewhat miffed by Behrle's discriminatory ~agism,~
---especially on the same day that the Social Security Administration for the
first time offiicially admitted that reducing Soc. Sec. payments is under current
serious discussion (but I've been shaking a good finger at Behrle,
back-channeled/bare-backed, tsk tsk, the disrespectful ingrate).

Not enough is said by or about poetry's silent phases ("to stop writing
poetry").  I am either in one or just coming out of one, and I don't know if I
~want~ to come back to poetry as poet, etc.  Laura Riding Jackson's continued
public articulation and writing from ~the position of~ a poet who is not writing
is supremely interesting to me.  ("I will never write poetry again, but that is
not enough to change me and revoke my 'essence' as poet,--- and it is upon that
authority that I'm going to keep blabbering and write kooky dictionaries here in
a trailer park in Florida.")

(I have wanted to get in touch with (presumed) computer-programmer Alan Jennifer
Sondheim about a language-generating program that could apply the rule base
[morphologies] of Jackson's syntactical-grammatical sentence structure choices to
the discrete vocabulary she was using in her last poems.  I believe that the
output of such manipulations would in essence be "by" Jackson, or by whomever
else such operations could be performed upon, Hart Crane, say, or someone of a
helpfully small output.  New but posthumous.  Ouija poetry.  Our language and
poetry on the page, absented of voice, is just that: vocabulary arranged
according to discrete, idiosyncratic rules.  You ARE the sum of those factors.
--- But ongoing attempts to construct a "paper machine" version of that R.I.P. by
hand, lists, formulae [N-V-N; N-V-Aj-N; . . . for Noun-Verb-Noun
{Subject-Verb-Object, Noun-Verb-Adjective-Noun, etc.] are difficult to draw to
completion.)

To cite only the easy reference immortals: The legendary silence of Rimbaud, the
interim silences of Rilke and Valery, and what they ~did~ with or during those
silences fascinates me (Valery's immersion into mathematics during his
poetry-less years, for example).

AUTOBIOGRAPHIA LITERARIA OF A TOTAL FAILURE NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD OF IN THE FIRST
PLACE OR WOULD GIVE A HOOT IF YOU DROPPED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND EVERY
LAST POET INCLUDED WHO WOULD NOTICE

In my own case (WHO CARES!), now that my personal life has been callously ripped
open on The List--- after the death of my 16-yr. old cat Shiki in January 2000,
two years of nightly, hour-and-a-half sitting, eventually 28-line maximum poetry
production came to an abrupt stop.  When, after the fact, I realized that I had
"stopped writing," I wasn't sure I entirely minded or that I should force myself
back into it.  Instead, it being a new millenium, me being on my own [cat-less]
for the first time in 18 yrs., I decided that secondary paths of "creativity"
that I was playing hide-&-seek with all my life, such as music (composition) and
photography, this being a technological age, might be worth finally taking up
"seriously."  I entered a "non-verbal" arts period that lasted a year and a half.

(Avant-garde cat requiescat photography of Shiki at
http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/jeffreyjullich/lst?.dir=/CATS+MU+%26+SHIKI+(IN+MEMORIAM)&.view=t
.  Click thumbnails to enlarge.)

Then, --- strange how crises, Scylla and Charybdis, bat me back and forth between
poetry and no-poetry, --- when I injured my left hand in May, within days (at
first I assumed I had "regressed," defensively), I was picking up on the Greek
translation stuff and poetry projects I'd put aside years ago.  I don't entirely
like the change.  "Poetic consciousness" is in many ways a more personally
uncomfortable, conflict-ridden state of mind (being the most long-lived axis of
my personality, with archaic roots in ["Maxims from my Mother's Milk", Messerli]
nursery rhymes etc.) than the empty-headedness music and imagery had given me.
Camille described her bed-time "poetic"/"audio-hallucinatory" consciousness
recently.  "Poetic consciousness" is very bothersome for me now: my mind goes
into a sort of Sort mode, where words begin coming out of nowhere, based on their
~shape,~ consonants mainly: consonant -- cnsnnt --- Nissan --- canzone ---
nascent --- ~niente~ --- can son not . . .

Currently, I'm sort of teeter-tottering as to whether poetry is going to "break
loose" again, and whether I'll "let it."  With musical composition, because my
proficiency was so far below my language fluency, I found that I could work for
hours and get up to have produced barely four chords or a couple of measures.
The time/output ratio was absurd. --- But that's accustomed me to, and changed my
expectations about what constitutes artistic activity, so that I'm more open to a
similarly glacial poetic "flow": lately, a day may produce, if at all, less than
a half dozen unrelated words,--- because I ~weigh and measure~ every phoneme so
infinitesimally now.  (There has been maybe one full "poem", a few lines here and
there, and a stalled attempt at a "longer" poem using a historical character
persona, something I'd never done, besides the 2001 slowdown I mention.  I can't
evaluate them, though: aesthetics/taste, too, is likewise dematerializing for me
and I tend to perceive only in terms of power-functions, social configurations,
etc., where "quality" becomes, as MM was saying, obscurantist.)

Enough about me.

Isn't Robert Grenier the master of "impoverished idiom" that you were searching
after?  Hannah Weiner seemed to be constantly bungling her diction in a laughably
frank way.  Heather Ramsdell's "Lost Wax" has numerous, shockingly inarticulate
phrasings.

I'm not an advocate of "Great Books", necessarily (despite appearances), but---
it's precisely this ~agism~ --- damaging not only in turning against the most
unheard voice in America, that confined in nursing homes --- that prevents boy
from seeing the adolescent ~youthfulness~ of these Great Male Authors!  Milton is
big great eternal post-pubescent wanting to kill king, sympathy for the devil . .
. Milton: our first Satanist.

I've been re-reading Dante's Paradiso,--- and he's so f--kin' weird.  Here you
have this guy, right (I know little about Dante's actual autobiog)? who falls in
love --- is it some under-age minor, like Petrarch's? --- and he does nothing
that 2001 young can understand to consummate that passion.  To the contrary he's
possibly living in religious chastity (crossing knees),--- and he sets up this
architecture where he SPEAKS ILL OF THE DEAD!, putting people he personally knew
and political figures in dioramas.

Paradiso Canto III: he meets in heaven Piccarda Donati, deceased sister of a
friend of his; he's already shown us that friend of his in Purgatory (thanks,
Dant'.  Nice pal);  Piccarda was forced into some sort of "hateful" marriage that
betrayed, I take it, her nun's vows; --- so, she's IN A LESSER HEAVEN, as far as
Dante can tell, cause she's in the outermost ring.  Like living in the suburbs: a
fate too unthinkable, Tantalus paradise.  VICTIMS GIVEN "LESSER PARADISE" FOR
HAVING, what, BEEN WRONGED/RAPED?  How come? Dante wantsa know.  Telepathic
untouchable Beatrice soul knows what he's wondering and goes into a philosophical
critique of ~will~ --- but--- here your head'll spin, whee: in the process, Bea'
holds out as moral models a PAGAN Roman who STUCK HIS HAND IN FIRE because he
hadn't STABBED an enemy of the state, and a great Christian martyr who was
roasted alive on a gridiron.  Like, nice holy saint mentality, Bea'.

Young fogey, the truth now:       can ~you~ get that weird?

My "attitude" (4:15 a.m.: fogies will "go to bed now" as soon as ~you~ crawl
under the sheets first, Endymion stretched out under moonlight, hustler):

I wasn't really calling for a "moratorium" on poetry.  What I meant was more that
the "I am a poet and worth listening to in my self-centeredness" position is
insufficient to advance the common cause of  XXIInd century poetry in general.
Overpopulation plus hyperproductivity equals--- our current Hong
Kong/Calcutta/Times Square inundation.

Most poetry ~has no Other.~

Confessionalists/autobiography has the Other of the maligned parent (Mr. Olds)
who's being badmouthed ~without recourse to defense~ since there is no
opportunity we know of to hear Mr. Olds' or the Lowells' side of the story.
Poetry like Susan Howe's, or Garret Lansing's "Stephen Phillips' Marpessa" poem,
or etc. or etc., the utopian poetic ~care~ that I was calling for that would
CARRY FATHER across the river on back, Aeneas-wise, instead of just or at least
prior to stereo-Oedip-ically murdering him --- work like Howe's, presents the
Influence of Anxiety antecedent literary figure as ~an Other~ who, uniquely, we
can meet on their own terms:  I have gone back and read AND I LOVE HER
Watts-Dunton (Swinburne's boyfriend) whom Howe uses in ~Pierce.~

Libraries are columbariums.  Books are funerary urns you can rattle and hear an
echo of the dead.

Print and literature are ultimately a necrophilia.

"Fame" and "greatness" wane in their drive, for me.  "Love"/"lust" and
"attraction" take on more force.  EVERYTHING, if you have the dedication to
persevere, THAT YOU HAVE WASTED YOUR ENTIRE LIFE ON will be SWEPT AWAY by a
multitude of current global population nine billion multiplied by another
generation to total WHITE NOISE people UNABLE even if they wanted to distinguish
"good"/"bad" art when there are N-zillion logically valid aesthetic positions and
a mountainous heaps of remaindered poetry books like toxic waste dumps of
"sincerity" nobody'll be able to stomach for an instant in our increasing
emotionlessness.

The smaller the audience the better, because a very small audience approaches the
limit of ~an audience of one.~  And an audience of one, you and another person,
is the real condition of ~INTIMACY.~

("Audience", I detest the term--- like: clap, audience!  Now performer will bow.)

Fame, outside Hollywood/Time Warner, can only begin by you dedicating yourself to
making SOMEONE ELSE who isn't already famous famous.  Ashbery was a fine model:
this fogey harped and harped, whoever would talk to him, like Monsieur Idee Fixe:
"Have you read Raymond Roussel?"  "Have you read de Chiricho's 'Hebdomeros'?"
(WHO?) "...Laura Riding Jackson?" and when finally he made it big the first thing
he did was turn all of that authority he'd garnered to getting Roussel and
"Hebdomeros" into print and attention.

Come to bed now.  The mattress is still warm with your father's sweat.

book. the seventh going, the last.


the relationship of consciousness to the world vis-a-vis structure,
abstraction, symbolic systems. but the relationship of consciousness to
its inscription: who is inscribing: veering back from the concern, blind
ambition (see anecdotal) tending towards theoretical thwarting, return of
the repressed - immersive and definable structures which are negotiations
- irreversible or reversible - hierarchy of such structures - sets and
arrows - categories - the implicate orderings of consciousness within all
of this - untended: unintended consciousness: my work is already an es-
cape, already unfounded: the phenomenological investigation of this rela-
tionship requires a certain sensitivity: i have granted myself this: fol-
lowing thought into harder structures: following structures into their
languor or lassitude: the seventh going...the leaving of the number...
for sooner or later there must come that moment of decay...proton or
otherwise...the loosening of the strands, breaking of the vessels...the
implicate order itself gone in the gone world...structure always requires
maintenance...i leave you to your fate...the going of the book...interior
moves...

writing, within, or against, the paragraph, writing among texts, return to
the repression of style, continuous honing, innuendo, negation, contrary
and contradictory, of the sixth go at it, against the other five,

the quasi-logical structure of the lifeworld. but which lifeworld, which
state of confusion, which state of health: consideration of obsessional
neurosis as the holding-forth of the world, radical deposition - the
continuous need to inscribe, reinscribe - territorializations and assign-
ations - not the theoretics of doubt but the analytic inability to take
anything for granted - exhaustion as a condition for the constant recon-
struction of the world: thinking of the play or theatrics of the world:
methodologies of distancing and absorption: for it is of the moment...
the logical structure which requires the possibilities both of connection
and disconnection at a distance...that affairs may have no relationship
among themselves...none of them...that affairs are all connected...teth-
ered...wandering in a landscape (such that) entities are unknown, incon-
ceivable...

of the sixth go at the philosophical, against the other five, the inter-
stice of thought, thought's blurred reminiscence, thought's thoughtless-
ness,

the potential for philosophical investigation through audio-visual and
other media. but what style, what genre: whose investigation, what gender,
what methodology, what deployment of desire: questions of periodization,
extension of media on a continuous feed-forward basis, inextricably tied
down to corporate research and development programs - weakening of them-
atic thinking - the need to organization meta-methodologies of search /
knowledge strategies - on the other hand the loosening of semantics
through the muteness of audio-visual representations - what one might call
"kidding ourselves" through the semblance of research: that's all there
might be to it: a certain carelessness of thought: fudging, the kludge or
glitch: loss of rigor: one might speculate that even the theorization of
such loss constitutes a defensive fortification against theorization
itself: one door might close...another open...on both sides the identical
landscape...oxherders visible in the distance...the encryption is abso-
lute...

of the sixth, the go at it, defending the other five goes, of the text
which insists on veering out of genre, of the genre of the philosophic, of
the literary,

the natural order of structure. but what nature: whose nature: whose
cooperation: whose corporation: but what contractuality: the natural world
under the sign of capital, in-corporation, em/bodiment of nature, the body
politic, political body, structure transformed into performance, action -
but the chaotic debris of the body - extensions of flesh - subtexting in
which the dissolution of language is paramount, and always the problematic
of the symbolic - what is the binding of standing-in-for if not already
allegory, sign, inscription, intention - think of the bound body as al-
ready the hieroglyph and its politicization, the restraint of the symbol-
ic: arousal, tumescence, distension, stretched or opened skin: upwelling
of debris and frisson, shuddering, stuttering, trembling of the subject:
she knows it has reached...already...you might have guessed it...you
could already see it in the sixth go at it all...approaching a moment
when it is completed...ready for others' eyes...interpretations...hermen-
eutics...approaches...critiques...postulations...hypotheses...how empty
and vulnerable...

or of the sixth go at it, binding the other five, of the politicization of
philosophy, the ideology underpinnings, of the sixth go at it underpinning
itself, loosening, "hardly something to write home about,"

consciousness in relation to subjectivity. but what consciousness: what
eidetic reduction: what cognitive mappings: what mathematical catastroph-
es: what tropes: the jump cut from phenomenology to mathesis, suturing the
subject for whom the book is written, the writing of explanation and
description and the problematic situating both, the cusp catastrophe as
that leap which creates structural extension, boundary, moving-on - the
fold, leaping into the fold, the relationship of the fold catastrophe to
the sheffer stroke and its dual - elsewhere of not-both-a-and-b tending
towards the nomadic, exhaustion - the exhaustion of "the species" or "the
organism" - planetary exhaustion, universal denouement - already present
in the specter of death - wandering in the dual - neither-a-nor-b - it is
as if it splits: neither one nor the other: then there is the proboscis or
exploratory thesis: we have escaped the monadology: the proboscis is a
sign of truth...extension extends both tolerance and domain...every phy-
sics existing within the limit...newtonian...euclidean...asymptotic...
there is always something else...increase the energy or magnification...
the other will appear...

of the sixth go at it, expelled from the rest, temporally following after
the others, "camp-follower," the go explaining everything, the diegetic or
diacritical go, of the interstitial, of all of them, of the goes to come,

inserted into enumeration: unaccountable and unaccounted-for: "there's no
telling" of the soul: "there's no telling" of the eye: there's no future
but hunger: no future but the desire or commitment to one or an/other:
the other appears at the magnification...at the limit everything changes
...there is no limit...

there's no telling of the sixth, the sixth does the telling, it's as if
the sixth were told to itself, whispered to itself, it's as if the sixth
were imaginary or avatar, hardly an insertion, as if the sixth were
suddenly, irrevocably, scratched into the text, as if its place were
placed and forgotten, as if one "walked away" from meaning and its defen-
sive fortification,

virtual subjectivity and its relation to protocols, the imaginary, and
linguistic performativity. but which protocols: whose imaginary against
what inscription and whose thetic: but what languages and what mechanisms
of performance/perforation: who is speaking for whom across avatars, first
through other persons and tenses, what insistence carries the projection
and project of consciousness across real and virtual networks, what of
consciousness as such project, what of the peripheral imaginary, the
imaginary always already at a loss against or through the symbolic, what
of the symbolic as always already foreclosing, what of the toppling of the
scheme of things, what of alterities, multiculturalisms, sloughs, symbolic
emissions and spews, flows, the flooding of clutter and part-objects -
spoken within or spoken-for by avatars - consciousness as dialectic among
semantic emissions among subjects only some of which seem real - there are
always the virtual among us - ghosts, emanants, kami - ectoplasms at the
periphery - prosthetics, prostheses - who among us is cyborg cauterized by
insertion of flesh or electronic diegesis - moving among cyborgs - all of
us caught in virtual realities - the keywords absent, unknown - we exhaust
ourselves avoiding death and its already equally exhausted aporia - we're
drawn in and out of it - this is a different sort of limit...entirely...
no...this is exactly the same...confrontation of the other as the self
swoons or collapses into unconsciousness...

it's as if the sixth were a portal to the fifth, it's as if the fifth were
coming forth,

we're speaking as if we're spoken-for: we're spoken-for as if we're speak-
ing: imagine a speech bypassing to such an extent that it occupies another
stratum entirely: that it appears to come from elsewhere: from neither-a-
nor-b: that it is one with aurality: that it comes from the limit...that
it is the limit of the end which is denouement...that it continues past
the exist from the theater...that it is an emission or spew from the thea-
ter...from the theatrical...

of the sixth which is bypassing, which is already speaking against itself,
which is attempting closure, finish, beyond the denouement, which is of
the end, ending itself against the rest "of them,"

the entrapment and proliferation of detail in a partially-cooled universe
between plasma and annihilation. but which inscription and which seal:
but what decade and what millennium: but what substrate and cosmological
constant: and what of the sweeping away of the diachronic, necessary for
the therapeutic or functioning of the organism within this space, this
imminency, annihilation at the limit taken to the level of the absurd-
catastrophic, debris - we're huddled in relation to our own demise - we
can smell the fear of it - the phenomenology of scent - nowhere and
everywhere at once - the smell of a person indeterminate, unidentifiable,
seductive - the procuring of death - writing and writing against it - the
continuous evolution of writing into and out of it - writing oneself into
existence - writing oneself out of it - or at that limit where there is
no mapping...no writing...inscription...whatsoever...no mapping...no per-
ception..."she collapsed utterly upon the stage...they had to rush her
out of the theater"...the audience...

the sixth go at it all already written out of it, as if these intersper-
sions no longer existed, as if one were subservient to the future
anterior, the very scent of the sixth, its huddling, its refugee status,
the audience...

the scent bringing us back: the scent of the w/hole, anal musk: the scent
of the cauterization of philosophy: the anal fissure - not the inscription
of a / not-a, but the fissure of the same among/within the same: substance
fissures, structure breaks at inscription: she is doing her toilet...she
is reading...wiping herself...her scent is everywhere in the room...it is
as if the walls have closed with her help...she wipes herself repeatedly
...it takes a while...the touch of the paper soft against her hole...

of neither inscription nor fissure, of the sixth, already broken, of its
annoyance, almost the scent of decay,

the scent of abjection, falling-apart: the body bound, held taut against
or within the generation of the hieroglyph: substance into structure
through the release of no-thought: desire: glyph: she touches her anus
lightly with her finger...she is utterly clean...clean to the limits "of
what soft paper might be able to do"...she rises...

the unmentioned or unmentionable sixth go at it all, hardly a considera-
tion, variorum editions piled on, one after another, as if in collusion,
collaboration with the enemy, espionage, each reading the other, of public
consumption,

the orders and relationships among communication, communality, and sexual-
ity. but what mind lost among them: what sado-masochistic part-objects
modeling the contractual contrast of the world, who are the communities
that assemble consciousness out of linkages and couplings, out of contigu-
ities and contingencies, what are the mathematics that operate within
these fields such that the addition of a term in a chain may or may not
affect that chain, and the withdrawal of a term in a chain may or may not
transform the topology - what is the lure of a masochism in which all
theoretics are abandoned - the organism at the limit of its existence - "i
am still alive" - the shell or hull of the organism - the universal
condition - but the rupture from everyday life: but the return: it is at
the juncture that the contract is enacted: that use becomes exchange: the
incipient or implicit or implicate or emergent quality of the signifier:
the word just beginning as the bonds are released: she flushes the toilet
...pulls her panties up...her skirt...smoothes her clothing...the book she
was reading...her own...she's surrounded by herself..."one of those few
times in my life i felt really complete"...

released into the sixth go at it, the problematic of enumeration beginning
all over again, releasing the sixth into the hinge between closure and
further operations, as if, to operate upon the book, the text, a universe
of universal operations,

fragility and specificity of operability and the human. but what goodness:
but what taxonomies of errors, mistakes, phenomenologies of corrupted or
failed teleologies, what judgments, what ethos: the constant collapse in
the face of catastrophe, beginning and ending with ground zero, the null
of physics politicized, culturalized, as the embedding of the focal-point
within the aegis of any project of the subject - the implosion of infor-
mation within and without the subject - think of the skein or membrane of
the subject, subjectivity - network subjectivity, subjective networking -
embedded survival - "i am still alive" - "i" turns against itself: is
turned: is shredded: cannot turn: loses "its" domain: fissures: it is here
within this fissuring that "i come closest to the substance of the world":
she comes out of the room...the light is harsher...she has to adjust...
everything in relation to the world...outside of the bathroom she hears...
sees...touches...people speak to her...there are books...papers...to be
read...radio...television...telephone...inside the adjustment itself falls
away...she can contemplate the ending of the book...not its finality...it
is never such...never in such a way..."one never loses track fully of
one's children"...

but the sixth go at it is not the sixth go at it all, not of the sub-
stance of which it is a part, not fissured or broken down, not corrupted,

propositional logics and the elsewhere of the sheffer stroke and its dual.
but whose withdrawal of the not-both-a-and-b, whose banishment of neither-
a-nor-b: what of the stroke itself engendered as | in relation to the dual
v, the stroke retaining the dissemination of division, the dual tending
towards the problematic of the scapegoat and expulsion - the nomadicism of
the disappearing map - the implosion of the map into the real - nomadic
annihilation of landmark, fluid kinship entities, constant transformations
- one might say survival "at any cost" - there are no universal discourses
- no discourses of the universe - automated writing - the philosophical
writing of/by the automaton - the writing of the tape-recorder: imagine
such without tape: it is the machine which is speaking: it is speaking
through us: it is a far cry from the turing machine: turing's cry: the
children in her demanding to emerge...she writes constantly...obsessively
...she can't sleep at night unless she's written something "she approves
of"...sometimes masturbation..."all those connections are there"...she
notes...she takes notes...she takes note of...these variations...

of, somewhere along the line, the final go at it, the manuscript put
aside, the book completed, the philosophical argument temporarily term-
inated, the professor returns to her study, returns home, the professor
has a meal, go to sleep, dreams, the professor wakes in the morning,
decides just for once not to go to work this day, she turns over the
day...she takes note of it...

doubt and deconstruction of conclusions. but whose doubt against what
standards and relativisms: what auguries of truth and denial: what obses-
sional neuroses: what ignorance, incoherencies: the autobiography of the
leap, short-circuiting or short-cutting ignorance, as if something could
be made out of whole cloth, there are always strategies of apology,
implications of humility, everything in the way, no clarity towards its
absence - theoretical weakening, weak theory, as the shifting behind the
scenes - think of the submerged philosophy of submergence in relation to
extruded theoretical abstraction, pronouncement, death and facticity - the
humility of the masochist: the transformation into substance: from there
the pronouncement of no pronouncement: there is no mirror, no dust: there
is no body: of the time when the thing is born that she annotates...she
thinks "of these notes...annotations...of the world i find myself in...in
a way of finding myself"...she finds herself saying...

the professor puts the manuscript of the sixth go aside, just for the
moment; the book "has almost completed itself," the book is "as finished
as it's going to be," "i've done with the book," she knows...the world
is hardly such as it is or annotated...there is far more to it...later
...it will gnaw at her...now...just for a moment it's as if everything
is okay...

the scientific as that methodology among others, in spite of heuristic
breakdowns and the problematic of mathematics. what crystalline mechanism
inherent of the tractatus-logico-philosophicus, what neoplatonism, what
conventions, inscriptive labor: retaining the last vestige of ontology,
giving existence a nearly-decomposable structure from groundwork to
lifeworld, superstructure disconnections, proliferations of objects,
elements, particles, things, organisms, universal constructs of contrasts
and boundaries, boundaries maintenance, the general economy of inscription
- episteme and ontology blurred - interpenetrations of regimes and domains
- conventionalisms and idealities both subject to the same dis/ease of
heuristic - bricolage or making-do in the world - this is hardly satisfac-
tory for anyone - this is hardly the case of the world - the case of the
world in relation then to the case of our being, dasein - the case of the
world in relation to dis/ease - but there is no case: there is no world
"such that it or that is the case": there is always the case that one does
or does not make: there is always the general case but never the most
general case: there are only notes...she's noted her stomach is once again
upset...she's feeling ill..."been feeling ill"...she returns to the toilet
...pulls her skirt and panties down...the feeling of nudity is comfortable
...this is all there is...of the writing-machine or the description-mach-
ine...far less of explanation...as soon as i start thinking this way it
falls apart...back into that doubt such that everything is problematic...
she knows...thinks...it has something to do with health...

the case comes to a close, the professor muses, at least at the sixth go
of it all, it's by and large, at least for the moment, i'm going to have a
breather, after or before the illness...what is in my stomach...what is
happening to me...she thinks momentarily of the phenomenology of causality
..."is happening"...everything is about agency...she thinks...but really
...everything is about agency dying...

the topology of intention and neurality in relation to externalized mind
and memory. but what privilege of data-banks, whose computers, whose
optical fiber, whose skein of satellites, what membranes and firewalls,
whose hackings and what penetrations: the future of networkings among
multi-taskings, virtual realities, information wars, incandescent sexual
hysterias, thickened communalities, and the relationships among these and
other futures vis-a-vis theoretical abstraction and general accounts of
cultural and universal creation - teledildonics and nodal bodies - voy-
eurisms and exhibitionisms as inversions or dissolutions of entities,
categoricities - the splayed or opened body - the body displaying or
opening - the w/hole of the body - disruption or perturbation of percep-
tion - the skeins of death and exhilaration - the splayed or opened
electric body: mesh of contacts: bridgings, spark-gaps, tesla coils,
stelarc-penetrations as flesh turns nebulous turns nebula: the absolute
revulsion against secrecy is also the revulsion against language and the
foreclosing of the signifier: bell's theorems as the body scatters: it's
kept in contact: it's kept in contact with the skein: with nothing: with
itself: with the semantics of foreclosed entities: the signifier makes
agents...agents are signifiers..."otherwise the headless world"...how
much of the shifter...i...need exist in order to set in motion...innum-
erable universes...her mind wanders...

i'm going to enjoy myself after the fifth, before the seventh, she thinks
of the trajectory, of the content and indexicality of the book, of its
weight, the cover chosen by the publisher (an unknown chinese painting of
the sung dynasty), of the narrative faltering, almost bring the work "to
its knees," there is the beautiful book in every universe...and it is in
my universe and it is my book...she thinks...

partial-objects and partial-mappings as givens in the construction and
reconstruction of the world. but of the gathering of accumulations and
assemblage of fragments, of the clutter and a-historicity of the world:
the disappearance of history, resonance of ideological tendencies among
historiographies, irrelevance of historical and theoretical recuperation,
the loss of the world among the world - the absolute loss of the world in
the future of the cosmos - writing/inscribing degree zero - the horizon of
the uselessness of organism - continuous eroding of transcendence - gras-
ping or cohering of imminence - loss of imminence: turning away for the
moment...she considers...innocence "in its place"...the innocence...not
of the world...but her innocence at stake...the recognition that there
are levels within everything she sees or does...that her work has involved
a certain uncovering...she's out of the bathroom thinking...i'm leaving
debris behind in more ways than one..."everything is uncomfortable"...
everything is partial...the erosion of shit or rather the erosion of the
world into shit...organisms decontextualize...information irretrievably
lost...mayday...mayday...

of the sixth, here and now, of its inscription, it might be any of a
series, accounted for, the terms begin to blur, one into the other, each
revision another addition or edition, except for the punctuation, she
muses, you could hardly tell where one ends and the other begins, i'm so
tired...i'm so tired of it all...waking up in the morning and realizing
none of it matters...the neuroses don't disappear...i sleep as badly as
ever...in a while the finishing of the book...sinks in...it's back to
the same old routines...it's as anyone might imagine...she thinks and in
this fashion the symbolic devolves...back into the imaginary...it's all
there...nothing's there...

loss of positionality: what is unaccounted-for: accountancy and the de-
marcation of nodes, direct and indirect addressing: a list of cases: if
not 1 then 2; if not to then 3; if not n then endif: she's feeling
somewhat better...sweating however...feverish...endif...

every content an indirect addressing, including the sixth, tending towards
those resonances already discussed, in which feedbacks collapse into
skeins of relationships, in which relationships are ruptured...turned or
inverted...inside and outside...momentary stases...impediments...nothing
more...

the use of cases, examples, anecdotality, perceptual modes, in relation to
theoretical abstraction. what stories hidden with failures, ridden with
failures, gaps in texts, hiatus, ignorance: what negations (there are
none): what tales (they're all fiction): what parables (pretense!): and in
relation to the audience, what demographics following what core phenomena,
core metaphors, what one might tell you of an evening in miami with grack-
les scrabbling among scraps of food already evincing a symbolic construc-
ted among all of us in crude parody of heisenbergian sheffer-stroke quasi-
analytical approaches, as if the natural world were no longer problematic
but a gift towards the understanding - or now, outside this hotel room
#330 there are cartons of palm pdas on the landing - they have been there
all day - some are opened, people are taking them - i imagine, idiotic-
ally, vast supplies of drugs - they're payoff - everyone knows what's
going on - right outside the window here - taken fearlessly - personal
communications and informal economies - more and more networks opening up
- you can see all of this from the window - i've drawn the shades - maybe
witnesses conveniently disappear - imagination runs wild - one never knows
- she arches her body naked on the bed: there are people outside: her
holes are visible, open: she is speaking: "i am alan sondheim's beautiful
wife, welcome to miami": he is sitting naked, erect, on a chair, his face
covered with her panties: he's moaning: the sound resonates with the
tunnel reverberation effect in final cut pro: the camera cuts between the
two of them: cuts to apartment-houses, children playing: cuts to people
walking down a street: cuts to an office interior: interruption of the
ending of the book or the seventh going...she's looking around the office
...looking out of it...interruption coming to an end...

she's listening to him moan, she's completed the book, strangely excited
now, her mind drifting to other things after the sixth, he's her neurotic
husband, can hardly keep his mind focused, he's always falling apart,
always building worlds out of nothing, or nothing out of worlds, it's
beginning to make less and less of a difference, the virtual is descending
like a dark cloud, impenetrable, onto the subject, any subject, any human
being, she thinks, she's him...he's her...there are no divisions...in the
war which is always on...body parts are piled on body parts...it's never-
ending...differences are always dissolving like shit itself...but there's
a pleasure...she thinks...in the bathroom...her own smells...surroundings
that are strangely comforting...more naked than nude...the exhalations of
the body...looking at the toilet paper before flushing...now though...
looking at him...her excitement building...the next time he'll wipe her
himself...

exhaustion, defuge, and the wavering of existence in terms of the physical
well-being of the body, as well as the deconstruction of that well-being.
but what disease of the writer, what writing-disease: what textual wound-
ing: what ending to what written world: what semantics, what syntactic
endings: from indo-european to the absence of the subject in the sentence,
the absence of the eye and the shifter, the winding up of the winding-
sheet and loosening of the world from language in relation to or in spite
of natural kinds, rigid designators, performatives, proper names, who are
alan sondheim, daishin nikuko, who are julu-jennifer - what wounding of
informal economies - what disseminations - you can have any name you want
- take any gender - it's all there for the asking - nervously looking out
the window - who will be next - here in the motel room - what knocks on
the door - emptied hallways - strangely quiet around here - the camcorder
runs on: everything is broken up: entities, circulations created: here is
a thing now: this is the thing: what is the thing but shit between the
two of them...abject mingling...when she dies...she muses...no one will
care about proper names any longer...there's a great sadness there...it's
overtaking her...

of the sixth of which this is all there is, the computer runs, the hard-
drive recoiling with entry after entry, the suppuration of the file
itself, what might have been canonically inert, now open in the digital to
eternal salvation on one hand, continuous change, revision, hacking, on
the other, it's someone else's revision...someone else's hacking...it's
even someone else's salvation...sadness turning towards depression...what
to do...what to do...

this is the first thing: this is the only thing there is: to rest...to
give herself a break..."not to be so hard on herself"...

of the sixth, almost the disappearance of the bones, of the bones, almost
the disappearance of the marrow, of the marrow, the disappearance of the
flesh, but of the book...of the sevenths and now last...not so much a
disappearance as a momentary appearance..."i'm here for you"..."i've
arrived"..."i'll be here for a while"..."now i'm here and present and the
world is very very lovely"...do not be depressed my love...do not be so
very...so very sad...

but the dis/ease of writing - sound of keys - i can't stop this - the
living representation of information society - at work on the network -
gasping for breath on the network: holding our own on the network: a swarm
of us: groups of us: groups of us comforting us among us...chora and
chorus...the maternal roots...lullaby...but the healing of the two of
them...for a moment...in the dusk or is it later in the evening...moaning
and other sounds at the limits of the other...mewlings...cries...

groups of us writing through her, assembling the sixth go at it all, muted
conversation about the sixth, its continuity and careful honing, we
arrive at everything through collaboration, discussion, you'd be surprised
at how few disagreements there are, she could sense already...she could
sense herself...she could see it coming...and all the discomfort knowing
that the world continues exactly as before with all its jagged edges..."i
didn't learn a thing"..."i'm as ignorant as ever"...

what writing: what loss of writing to the world: such presumption that
continuous production becomes closer to the thing, defines it, the "thing"
or "it" or production, that the model of labor creates and forecloses
among entities, that divisions and boundary phenomenology are somehow
riddled with existence - always honing in - always flying apart - them-
atic thickening, weakening - the philosophy in this book - this attempt or
collocation of thought - this process of thinking - a kind of jabbering
back and forth from systems of representation through structuralisms
always nearly-decomposable, bricolaged, falling apart - writing ground
down - inscription as well - into the abstraction of thought constantly
retethered - the thinking of the return - nomadic homing-in - corrals

hold back floods: muscle tension retains shit: "slips of the lips sink
ships": "maybe someday i'll return"..."this is...what might be called...
the saying or thinking of everything...of thinking nothing at all...a poor
thinking...poor thought"...she begins to cry...mourning every tiniest
thing in the world...every wounded insect...every wounded bird...trees
with broken limbs...she senses "the depression hitting her"..."the depres-
sion coming on"...

she's opening herself up to herself for the first time, she thinks, now
that the work's done, now that i have myself, she's looking in the mirror,
naked, closely examining her body, she's "got to pull out of it"...she's
got to open up..."it's a book after all"..."it's nothing but a book"...
"don't take it so seriously"...

that of or within existence - that of the nought, cipher - of weyl's
cartesian origin as the last vestige of the ego in mathematization - you
can always locate from that point - sufficient vectors, orthogonal or not
- giving thought the substrate necessary for reading - writing - or is it
in fact necessary: consider a flooded reading, a reading without order:
phrases and fragments, resonances out of which a certain philosophic tone:
philosophy itself: emerges: "it's a masterpieces"..."you've said all
you're going to say"..."you've gone to the limit...taken it to the limit
...you've returned"...she's walking...dazed...

she thinks, i've stuttered everywhere among myself, i've felt my texts run
through me repeatedly, i've mouthed them insistently, i've cut crystal out
of them, i've brought them to their knees, they've taken me over...i've
lost my limbs...they're my phantom limbs...i'm dying...

returning to the apparatus or partial-objects necessary for this - most
recently bought an antique glass pen - dip it in the ink, write for a
third of a page or so - hand-blown - here working with components made in
malaysia - the result of academic exchange - there are data-bases involved
- obsolescences - atavisms and dead media - prosthetics even in the
illumination of the screen (from before or behind) - what it is you are
reading "this" in - a whole system of temporary equivalences, technologies
- repetitions of databases - never forgetting a thing - to you...dear
reader...this is all i have to give you...this is what i've been working
for...towards...my entire life...there's very little left of me...nothing
can ever be taken for granted...i've never done that...all these partials
...impartials...in this world of partial impartials...her hands are flut-
tering almost uselessly...she's becoming aware of her hands...moving them
..."nearing the end of so many things at this critical juncture in his-
tory"..."in our history"...

neither the fifth nor the fourth; neither the fourth nor the third; nei=
ther the third nor the second which, almost mewling, crept along the
theoretical substrate desperate for suturing, neither the second nor the
first, far too exposed, inverted, laying the groundwork, withdrawing
simultaneously, of a certain breathing of the text, she's noticing her
breathing...is it always like this...is it always the same...on its own
...her breathing..."is philosophy a sickness"..."a sign of ill health"
...is writing itself that illness which produces no change in the writer
...in spite of everything...

writing into this: section by section: paragraph by paragraph: each revi-
sion as if it were the last: the most important: each addition a more
careful construct: the work appearing from the inside-out: philosophy
unbound: evening the seventh ending...not even the portal to the eighth
...the portal to the ninth..."having to end this sometime"...she's
feeling the loss of the word...loss of the world...perhaps there's a
meeting to go to...she should call a friend...her husband...they're

the toilet...she doesn't understand this..."i don't have the energy to
worry about it"...for a moment she thinks that the book...such as it is
...theoretical abstraction...is one long sign or departure...a form of
mourning...she thinks "there's very little left of me"...they are very
very tired...they fall into bed...turn out the light...she's whimpering
slightly..."existence...of and about existence...has everything to do
with it"...they fall asleep...they sleep...

of the sixth go at it all, the revision or breathing of the text, she is
sleeping soundly for the first time in her life, there are small cells,
cancer, in her left breast, just a few of them, they are feeding, "she

all of them are sleeping"...

Subject:      greatness, lateness, out-of-dateness
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Warning: long digressive post follows.

David Baratier adds some categories of greatness to my list, and naturally
one could come up with many others.  In fact, that is probably one good
thing to spend one’s time doing: continually thinking of new ways of being
great (or wonderful).  Either that or actually being it.  To each his own!

The Olson example you give for "The Living Great Theorem," David, puts me in
mind again of Barrett Watten's remarks on subjective aesthetic response, as
that is the same example he uses, albeit less approvingly.  I concur that
this sort of "great man" rep has its positive uses--firing up other writers,
planting ideas, etc.  I wonder further whether there is not, through some
ineffable alchemy, some tangible quality of greatness projected backwards
into the work "itself" as a result of such cultural enshrinement, so that
the "page still recasts that incantatory moment" as you say.  I think mebbe
perhaps, tho this is where people start crying canonization & mystification.
  This is for me what makes, say, reading a lot of first-gen language poetry
a stimulating experience rather than just a frustrating or tedious one: the
texts have come to contain some of the social energy they helped to
generate, becoming almost material icons for it.  This is ultimately
circular, but it is a good account of my experience as reader nonetheless.
It's not that any old thing can become "great" literature if enough people
take it seriously & then confer that seriousness back on it as in a time
machine; it's more that the greatness is a latent potential which becomes
more visible gradually, like a time-release watermark.  Belief in which
requires some measure of faith, I suppose, and that's the issue.

As for "The Single Poem Theory," all I can think of is James Tate's "The
Lost Pilot."  A cantankerous example, because this a "great poem" that made
a reputation, but in the years since I first read it and fell to my knees,
I've come to appreciate a lot of his other stuff a lot more, and to see that
initial monument as in many ways manipulative & schticky.  I guess the real
example would be Joyce Kilmer's "Trees."  _There_ is an impenetrably
solitary and unrepeatable act of enunciation.  Kilmer  _is_ "Trees," "Trees"
_is_ Kilmer.  And the greatness of the poem is absolutely undeniable as long
as there's anyone who remembers it, for obvious reasons.  Right?  I'll take
questions on that one later.

"The poet who is passed among poets" seems like an offshoot of the "Living
Great" category.  Don't about 87% of the poets most of us on this list read
fit into this group?

Some other possible categories:

1) Great At What They Do
2) Great For Two Years
3) GrrrrrrrrEATT!!!
4) Not So Great
5) Great Because They Think They Are
6) Great Until You Actually Read Them
7) Late, Therefore Great
8) Great Like a Fox
9) Great Because of Who Dislikes Them

-----------------

On to Jacques' renunciation of the Calling: my first instinct, a la Mike
Magee's, is to slap you in the face with a copy of _The Prelude_ and jam
your pencil back in your fist,  Jacques, but I won't do that.  [Jacques
sighs in relief.]  People who decide they shouldn't write anymore need to
just go in their corner and work it out, whatever it is.  If you ultimately
decide to go all Laura Riding on us, that's a pity, but only you can say
whether that's right for you.

What I do want to address is this question of taste, which I do not think is
necessarily, pace Mike, "a wholly negative term and concept" or even
"obscurantist by nature," but nevertheless not as available an asylum as you
make it out to be, Jacques.

Back to Mike's comments for a minute.  When Clem Greenberg say he simply
prefers "good art to bad," he is obviously on one level being a reactionary.
  I don't mean to underplay the ideological violence going on in this or any
other blanket statement of aesthetic absolutes.  But he is still voicing a
sentiment, with some ironic wit I _think_, about what many tho not all of us
feel is a last analysis: art either is or is not good.  What makes a
difference is whether you take his quote as being actually about the art or
about Greenberg himself.  If the latter, then it still sounds like the only
honest approach to the question of "good" and "bad."

Because what are the alternatives?  The work's capacity to effect social and
political change, as some would suggest?  Certainly not, as one can easily
imagine a poem that makes the world a better place to live in by inspiring a
bunch of kids to go out and build a rec center or something but is
nonetheless a real stinker.  For example.

Is it then the work's adherence to a given set of mechanical rules or formal
expectations?  For instance, metrical smoothness or general euphoniousness
or deftly handled allusions or fineness of tone?  If this were the case, all
good poetry would just be like Thomas Hardy only more so.

I could go on, about art breaking with tradition, or generating critical
controversy, or containing certain "tensions," etc., but you can predict how
I would dispose of each of these suggestions.  What Greenberg's glib remark
does is point up to what extent goodness and badness finally resist all
attempts at insertion in a criteria-based system.  You can either point to
this in order to assert that goodness and badness--"taste"--is a destructive
concept, as you do, Mike, or you can fall back on it as a handy excuse for
throwing up your hands at the state of contemporary writing (which arguably
is excessively but incoherently obsessed with demonstrable criteria), as you
do, Jacques.  But what I'd like to do is resist this divisive set of options
if possible.  Jacques, you say that "no one takes their own hierarchies of
taste for granted anymore"; this would definitely explain why someone like
Greenberg looks hopelessly old-fashioned, and also why poetry might look
like it's having a personality crisis.  But I wonder if "taste" can't
survive transplantation into a hierarchically scrambled system.

I'm not prepared to map out the details all by myself this afternoon, but
one possible model of a context for post-hierarchical taste might involve 1)
a negotiation between several discrete factors--e.g., "social relevance,"
"formal wit," and "sex appeal"--in which the poem manages to satisfy each of
these demands in some way; 2) a disarming of the reader's capacity to
demonstrate how any one or more of these criteria influence one or more of
the others, so that the total poem is capable of pissing off different
people for opposite reasons; 3) the potential for the poem to penetrate
mainstream channels of circulation in such a way that its transgressive or
subversive aspects escape suppression but are nevertheless placed in
positions where they can have an effect in some way counter to the
motivations of the mainstream agencies who have partly sanctioned the poem.
These three considerations boil down to a complex interplay between content,
context, and social transmission.  I'm sure there are ways to
expand/modify/replace this model, but what I want to suggest is that any
useful model of taste must account for both the innate qualities of the work
itself (which is what the New Criticism did fairly well) and the ways in
which the work is received in a dynamic, unstable cultural environment or
environments.  To privilege either of these considerations at the expense of
the other is a mistake.

Mike, I love your comments about people's response to language poetry, and I
think the ability of that phrase to elicit such comical dread is part of the
power of the poetry.  The combination of contempt, distrust, and titillation
implicit in this attitude is like the Elizabethan stigma surrounding
sonneteering ("You write those filthy things?  Let me see one.") You say,
"the people who hate X or Y poetry/poets do so as a result of *some* process
of institutionalization."  Absolutely.  And the people who _like_ X or Y do
so as a result of the same thing.  Taste, then, is the navigation of the
various institutional corridors within which likes and dislikes are
manufactured.  This is why your suggestion that "taste" be replaced with a
term suggesting "effort" or "ambitious-ness" is helpful, but needs to be
supplemented with some means by which to connect the explanation you offer
("I like the poem that does this because...") with an explanation for
exactly _how_ the poem "does this," which brings us back to the formal
considerations and old aesthetic categories, etc., ad infinitum. "The
question of what a poem is designed to do (or in any event what it does) for
a poet and her audience" inevitably involves the physical makeup of the poem
as well as / in addition to its maker's intentions, and zis is a concern for
ze structuralist critic.  But ve must _all_ become structuralists, vorking
for a society in vhich ze poet is a citizen on par vith ze molecular
scientist or ze domestic engineer!  Only zen vill ze poet take on ze
responsibilities of ze political being she has to become in order for ...
for ... um, OK, not sure where I was going there.

The point is that taste has to involve considerations of both material craft
_and_ imaginary market demands.  There.

I think "fashion" in the bad-Bourdieu sense is part of this model, actually,
and a reason why that ridiculous ABBA poem you resist, Mike, might make its
way into the Garden of Taste at some point after all.  And there might be a
real risk involved in that.  Just not yet ... can't ... make ... it ...
cohere...!

This ties in with Patrick's comments in his response to Jacques, on how "our
contemporary culture finds new ways to value crap."  If the ABBA poem is to
be successful, I think it will somehow have to _include_ the awareness that
it is participating in that debased cultural "project," and find a way for
its awareness to transform the crap into flowers.  It can be done.  I'm an
optimist.  As you say, Patrick, "One needs to be aware of his or her own
tastes, but one must also be able to see the range of tastes as well, see
ones place in that range.  And if a person can do that, and imagine new
possibilities for tastes, well, then something very interesting can happen."
  Right on.  I'd only add that one also has to keep one's eye open for
ranges of tastes that have been dynamited out of the side of the cultural
scene by global capital etc., so that when one moves across those ranges,
one always knows what kind of trappers are lying in wait.  "Compassion for
the old fogeyism" has to include the healthy suspicion that some of those
old fogeys are payrolled by Phillip Morris and ain't your good buddies.

Also, Patrick, I take seriously your observations about Harvard and
institutions in general having a unique capacity for "knowing" certain
things; the ways in which "knowlege" is mass-produced is of course directly
parallel with the mechanisms of the taste industry.  And as you say, it's
always a mixed bag.  Just because evil corporations manufacture something
doesn't always mean we don't need whatever it is.  Or just because all the
rich guys in Delft helped make Vermeer a genius or whatever doesn't mean he
wasn't.  Institutional knowledge (or taste) is a commodity like lots else,
and can be repackaged, nutritionally enriched, and sold by deadheads at the
farmer's market.  In other words, political concerns are practically
irrelevant to aesthetic value in the sense that they have anything to do
with the object itself, but they have to be negotiated nonetheless just to
make your way to a safe position for _enjoyment_ or _constructive use_ of
said object.

[BTW, Patrick, you mentioned Springsteen's "Born in the USA" as an example
of Reagan-era propaganda; not that I think that's the greatest song ever
written or anything, but just for the sake of accuracy, if you check the
lyrics, it's a pretty critical song.  Not that it wasn't _received_ exactly
as you say by a zillion yahoos in pickup trucks.]

Anyway, Jacques, I need to wrap this up, so I want just to question one
thing you said, since it's something I think you know I have strong feelings
about: how, on any basis soever, can you or anyone claim that O'Hara is
inferior to Eliot?  This is not a rhetorical question; I'm open to arguments
of any kind whatsoever.  Control over diction, cultural relevance, tightness
of pants, you name it, what on earth makes Eliot so much better a poet than
O'Hara?  I pose this as an open question to help us sort out our notions of
taste by putting them into practice.  I want to see claims for either Eliot
or O'Hara as the superior poet, and I want to see claims that address the
writing itself.  I'll reserve my own specific thoughts on the matter till I
hear from 20 other people.  Suffice to say that, along with Mike, I think, I
don't believe for a minute that Shakespeare or Eliot or anyone represents a
no-pass zone of greatness, as great as they may be.  I _do_ think that
Shakespeare and Eliot and Stevens and O'Hara are greater poets than, say,
Elinor Wylie or Larry Fagin, so I'm not just pulling a big relativist trip.
I just want concrete examples.

Thanks to everyone for the recent spate of energetic and thoughtful posts!
The list has become very interesting lately.

Kasey

This distressing talk from Jacques Debrot about "giving up" poetry could be related in certain ways to an essay in PMC that was announced here (with enthusiasm, I take it) by Barrett Watten a couple months ago: "Post-Avant-Gardism: Bob Perelman and the Dialectic of Futural Memory," by Joel Nickels. The essay is, in a sense, also about giving up.

A central argument in this essay (though I've read only once and incompletely; corrections welcome) is that "difficult," "non-narrative" poets like Perelman, etc. are not writing, really and after all, for present, living readers, but for a future --one presumes more "advanced"-- reading culture to come: The strong "Language" poem, then, according to Nickels, is in some sense like a whisper sent, sub rosa, across time, imbued
with a formal-semantic codedness that calls-out to a "futural memory", when and where the poem's present "avant-garde" opacity and fragmention may be,
with luck, completed and brought into unbounded view. Like one of those Plain of Nazca drawings, which the flatland of the cultural/somatic moment makes invisible (even to its visionary architect), but which is meant, one day, to be apprehended from an as yet unimaginable "above".

So to Mr. Debrot's quirky pessimism and defeatism, I say: Why give up writing poetry altogether, when all you have to do is give up writing for the *present*, and devote your energies, instead, to writing utopian lingual code for future?

That was a great list, Jim, and you shouldn’t kick yourself. I wanted,
though, to add to it, in part as just a kind of "evidence" or whatever of
the many & varied younger poets (though what is "younger"? under 30? under
40? 45?), all of whom I’ve read & who have written at least one poem or
series or book I was really amazed by. I’m going to limit it to New York
poets, or at least poets who I associate for whatever reason with New York,
since it’s largely the NY scene that Fagin was dismissing

Allison Cobb, who’s written a series of brilliant chapbooks, at least one
longer collaborative poem (with Jen Coleman & Chris Putnam), and who is a
really fabulous reader

Jen Coleman, whose work I know less of, but only because she’s published
less of it, though she gave a wonderful reading at Zinc earlier this year
(or late last?)

Julie Patton, whose poems seem like performances, and whose performances, no
two of which are the same, seem like poems, and whose writing is always
unexpected, highly torqued, playful & moving

Drew Gardner, whose Water Tables is wonderful, & who continues to amaze me
in his ability to weave numerous threads (p.o.v.s or systems of knowledge)
into play through a single poem (& who is also a great writer of Flarf)

Kimberly Lyons, who is one of my favorite NYC poets, & who I suppose is one
of the most "New York School" of anyone I’ll mention, though is that even
evident reading her amazing Abracadabra?

Tod Thilleman, whose A World of Nothing But Nations, a long poem made up of
entries made into a (purposely chosen) very small notebook,  is still one of
my favorite books by a younger NYC poet

I think of Stacy Doris as a New York, if not New York School, poet, although
she lives most of the time in Paris—anyway, Paramour is as lovely &
inventive as it is hilarious

I love Brian Kim Stefans’ variousness, his web-poem The Dreamlife of
Letters, which completely blew both me & Nada away the day we happened upon
it, and especially his book Gulf

Lytle Shaw, another poet whose variousness never ceases to amaze & inspire
me (these are going to get shorter, as it’s getting late)

Adeena Karasick, who’s written a series of absolutely stunning books

Siane Ngai & Dan Farrell, who’ve moved to the west coast, but both of whom I
saw read here, & loved

Rick Snyder, whose poems are smart, sardonic, intense

Kevin Davies & Deirdre Kovak--Kevin is, according to one friend, one of
Fagin’s favorite younger poets, as well as most of ours, and Deidre is
probably the funniest poet I’ve ever read

Rodrigo Toscano gave a great reading at Double Happiness earlier this year

as did both Kevin Varrone and Pattie McCarthy, at Zinc & the PoProj

well the thing about olson's "greatness"---and i've always found much
in his writings---is that the way it's often been articulated, it
seems almost to emanate from the fact that the man himself was kinda,
yknow, large...

I have been 1/2 monitoring the editing conversation and a thought keeps
coming to mind.  In practice, how do the numerous editors of a single
publication go about reaching for a cohesive vision of what their journal
stands for, represents, or chooses to include.  Is it only through
conversation and/or written mission statements?  Are there journals in which
poetry editors read the fiction and fiction editors read the poetry?

Subject:      Online Poetry Classroom
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Yo, Poetics Civilians:

I just stumbled across a site called the Online Poetry Classroom, brought to
you, apparently, by the folks who had the bright idea of holding a contest
to see which poet could get his or her mug on a U.S. stamp.  (Remember what
a constructive thread that was?)  The URL for this is:

http://www.onlinepoetryclassroom.org/

Although some of you will be taken aback, as I was, by links on the side-bar
with such headings as "How To Teach" and "What To Teach" (no, unfortunately,
I am not making this up), one of the most interesting aspects of this site
is the fact that you can link to pages to find your favorite poet and/or
poem.  I did not have the heart to investigate the latter sampling; however,
I am here to tell you that the listing of poets offers an incredibly mixed
bag.

First of all, of course, there are the usual (academically recognized)
suspects, including our own beloved Ashbery, Stein, Williams, & even O'Hara.
  (The fact that he is apparently not as great as Eliot, according to one M.
Perloff, who should know, has apparently not hurt his standing insofar as
this web site is concerned).  That much is to be expected.  Then, of course,
there is a sampling of some, academically "hot," & decidedly more
experimental poets: Charles Bernstein, Jackson MacLow, Susan Howe & Lyn
Hejinian fall under this category, as well as (inexplicably, but happily)
Mina Loy, Charles Reznikoff, Lorine Niedecker, & Bernadette Mayer.  Then--
VERY inexplicably-- there are also included younger (& very good) poets who
are near the beginning of their careers, at least so far as book
publications go: Kevin Davies, Stacy Doris & Eleni Sikelianos are the names
that I noticed.  BUT-- & this is the kicker-- here is the list of names that
I came up with (just on one quick read-through) who were EXCLUDED.  Tell me
if this makes any sense, boys & girls--

Bruce Andrews
Paul Blackburn
Joseph Ceravolo
Jack Collom
Clark Coolidge
Anselm Hollo
P. Inman
Harry Mathews
Alice Notley
Bob Perelman
Rod Smith
Jack Spicer
Chris Stroffolino
Anne Waldman
Louis Zukofsky

Now, my list of names is very arbitrary, I admit; in fact I can already
think of poets who weren't included who I should have thought of but didn't;
& on closer reflection I'm sure I would make my list a lot broader.  That's
not the point.  (By the way, I include Stroffolino & Smith ONLY because
Davies, Doris & Sikelianos are included, & I consider them a representative
sampling of poets at least as good as the other three.  I love the work of
all five, as well as LOADS of other "younger" writers, all of whom I
couldn't possibly mention, so PLEASE don't anybody take offense at this,
okay?)....

But, I DIGRESS--

The whole point of this post (in case you were wondering) is that you can
LET THE WEBMASTERS KNOW  the names of poets or poems that should be included
on their site.  This is what I did, with this list; but like I say, there
are lots of other poets/poems who should be included, & why should I have
all the fun.

So, go to this site & let em know what you think.

(By the way, let's not start another thread like the poetry stamp thing.
Pretty please.)

Your Comrade in Arms,

Mark DuCharme

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Now available:
SCORE 16: The largeness the small is capable of, an anthology of poems five
lines or less. Contributors include Robert Grenier, Bob Grumman, Miekal And,
Lee Ann Brown, Avery Burns, Joel Lewis, John Martone, Harry Polkinhorn, and
over 70 other poets.


SCORE MAGAZINE, since 1983, has been singularly devoted to visual/concrete
poetry, but starting with this issue it opens its pages to all poetries,
verbal through visual. If you would like a copy of SCORE 16 back channel or
send $10 to Crag Hill, 1111 E. Fifth St. Moscow, ID 83843.

From the editor's intro:
the largeness the small is capable of*  was sparked by the surge of short
poems reaching print starting in the mid-1980s. This surge has not let up as
of August 2001. I had to start somewhere; I have to stop somewhere. But
there are so many poems five lines or less that should be a part of an
anthology of such poems.

Of course the short poem was not born in the 1980s - it's a sibling of the
epic and had brief, furious life between the World Wars through the Imagist
and Objectivist movements - but under the sheer number of poems being
written lay the question why so many now?

I'm now less interested in answering that question, averse to sociological
speculation, but I am interested in showing off the quality, or quiddity, as
Liz Was puts it, of the short poem.

What I think I found: short poems have the same range as longer forms, the
same diversity. And why not? I might even argue that there's more meaning
per square foot (iambic or otherwise) in the short poem than other poetic
incarnations.

Humor is prevalent. Political statement. Surprise endings, turns of phrase.
Unabashed punning and other forms of wordplay.  Precision in choice of
words, in choice of line breaks, in spacing of both. Brevity, yes, but depth
too. Instantaneous meaning but also elusiveness. Clarity and opacity.

Yet for every characteristic (beside brevity) used to categorize short
poems, along came poems to gainsay them. For instance, many of the short poe
ms in print before the 1980s succeed essentially in the same ways as lyric
poems, but how do Joseph Torra's poems fit into any definition of lyric
poetry? G. P. Skratz and others have described short poems as arriving in a
divine flash, appearing whole, in need of little alteration, poems born full
grown rather than shaped over time by the poet, but in what way are Jeff
Conant's poems born in a flash? Some say short poems give up their meaning
at once, are immediately accessible. If you need that assumption undermined,
go, for one, to Jake Berry's poems.

But for all their various, vigorous presences, short poems often seem
short-shrifted in literary journals, relegated to filler. As short poems are
more susceptible to overcrowding than longer poems -- they need their
space - this borders on travesty. But for economic reasons, I, too, am
guilty of this travesty. Ideally the poems in this anthology should all have
their own page but SCORE, alas, could not afford to print an anthology
pushing 400 pages.

*Frank O'Hara.  Slightly Unfair Digression 1*

More than anything he ever actually wrote, it was a dune buggy on a beach in
Fire Island that launched Frank O'Hara as a p-o-e-t.  Otherwise, he would
eventually have shared, w/ Larry Rivers (good bad boy & O'Hara's symbiotic
partner in art)  unfashionable associations w/ white negroism, homosexual
anxiety,  art heroism, Day-Glo existential hipsterism, and  uptown/downtown
2-timing;  in tabloidese:   **50s Enfant Terrible Outflanked by Woodstock and
Warhol**.

In fact almost everyone--including you, Mike, in yr brilliant
dissertation--writes about O'Hara from a biographical perspective.  Which is
perfectly cool w/ me--I do it myself in my own dissertation--but that's
because O'Hara's work & ethic tends to cancel out the relevancy of the PhD
toolchest that privileges theory over experience.

*Democratic Taste 1*

a.  I admit that so-called high art is always to some extent *about* the
context of exclusivity.  My conscience here is Dave Hickey whose objections
to the fetishization of high culture--as providing occassions for
*mastery*--are a lot more persuasive than the ones I've read so far from the
Poetics List.  So I'm in the weird position of disagreeing in important
respects (though not, I hope, in spirit) w/ my favorite cultural critic.

b.  Still, something like Jim's nominalistic vodoo of naming 100  younger
poets, & consequently, by the very act of their being named by him, becoming
writers "doing impt work," is dumb in a way that's becoming almost fatally &
complacently routine--remember Silliman's naming 160 poets in _The Art of
Practice_?  If Silliman had read 100 pages of work by each of these poets he
would have to have read 16,000 pages--almost all of it uncollected at the
time he was writing (and perhaps still is).  More likely he (& Jim) had only
seen a few poems by most of the poets they list.

The 160 poets named have pretty much only each other for an audience, I'm
afraid.  And that audience is getting smaller all the time apparently (down
now to only 100).

c.  1.  there is such a thing essentially as aesthetic experience which is
not merely a false universality based on contingent class, gender, or race
interests (or adequately accounted for in terms of psychology, morality,
economics, or politics.  2.  judgements do take place all the time--they are
unaviodable, in fact-- despite the absence of universal criteria.  3.
Aesthetic judgement is not impossible if tradition, instead of being viewed
in any absolute sense, is seen instead as the site of a **conflict** whose
aim is the search for legitimation.  4.  intuition is involuntary in our
aesthetic responses.

*Frank O'Hara.  Digression 2*

Not only is Eliot a more interesting writer than O'Hara, but O'Hara never
wrote anything nearly as innovative as Merrill's _Sandover_, or Berryman's
_Dream Songs_.

*Democratic Taste 2*

5.  **Our aesthetic response, as Greenberg argues, requires the commitment of
our whole person**.

--to be continued perhaps, or not.

straightqueer sounds sufficiently "cool" (a word that's still used by my
kids!) ...my daughters' band they call The Nudie Suits but the music they
play I can actually listen to: its not all bang bang bang thumpa thumpa
music...but anycase Straightqueer is also very Postmodern as well as vaguely
Avant garde and Wildean but god save us not too Langpoian: its a trifle
Curnowian but not Taylorian as in "Richard" as I never listen to much music
apart from Bach's well Tempered Clavier and Mozart's Requiem with a dash of
Stochausen or Varese now and again....but its very multivocal and
oxymoronilogical and all those long words.... Glad to send this enormously
incisive and informative contribution to you etal. richard.

& you can of course add yr own work to the list of excess as a transgressive
strategy, Dodie.

But why are so few transgressive or pornological gestures really riveting,
humbling, or disturbing?  Hickey argues that beauty makes the transgressive
*persuasive*--that it's as *celebration* rather than as *critique* that
transgression achieves a real rhetorical acuity.

**One of the problems w/ devaluing aesthetic experience in the way that I'm
trying to use the term is that Kasey and Mike would really leave the status
quo in tact.   It's not that you can't find beauty even in LP, but that,
w/out something like the involuntariness of intuition in aesthetic experience
and the imaginative exertion demanded of *individuals* to account for that
experience, art becomes merely a form of institutionalized knowledge and
control--a question of other people's knowing what's best for you--& w/ a
roughly parallel agenda to the one K & M say they deplore.

P.S.  I think it matters too that you were talking about novelists, Dodie.
The novel can do almost anything.  It's subsumed poetry in a sense (Edmund
Wilson made this observation more than 40 years ago in Axel's Castle).  &
it's the only genre in which  there isn't a huge gulf between popular and
elite efforts--difficult novels constantly turn up on bestseller lists.

dear jacques,
         this is the passage--typically he rehearses it several times in the
article--from 'Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow, Blue,'
 "We must now turn back to this two questions which occupy a historically
symmetrical position on either side of Newman's challenge ('Who's Afraid
...etc, 1969, the de Duve essay is, and the date IS significant, 1983; when
is Danto's book published?). The first abstract painters asked themselves
'does painting still have a past?' and they addressed their question to the
future. This means that the pioneers of abstraction had their tradition
ahead of them, whereas we have it behind us. They are not yet "Modernists"
and we no longer are."

  This it seems to me a useful way in which to cast the post-modern
question--which is what I take you to be posing, jacques. Tradition is now
back in its usual place, but our relation to it is still compromised, or
peculiar because of the modernist inversion, which (and others I think)read
as a trap.  Our discussion of 'taste' or 'greatness' on the other hand is a
symptom of this peculilarity, it is about whether there is/should be 'a
tradition', and directs us towards an re-analysis of tradition derived from
our unique relation to modernism.

Hey Jim, Wystan,

Jim--it's humiliating to be called Pierre after we've been out drinking 1/2
a
dozen times together & you've published me in _canihaveyr_. . . .   But I do
tend to be socially recessive, so I think I can understand.  Anyway here's
what I think about yr posts.  Fagin's poetry, to my mind, isn't any better
than the best poetry being written right now--often by people in their 20s
(though a lot of the time I don't know how old the poets are  who write the
poems I like).  In fact, I almost always find tons of things to enjoy in the
poetry zines I pick up.

What Fagin--& what the other poets of his generation--are expressing, I
think, is the feeling that they've been passed over w/out having been given
their shot.   Do they deserve that?  For me--make up yr own mind--there's a
drop-off immediately after the 1st gen NY School.  & it tracks closely w/
the
decline in the cultural  status of poetry.  But that doesn't start in the
1960s--as Perloff said someplace recently (& I agree w/ her), O'Hara ain't
no
T.S. Eliot.  So as to which gen of epigones is superior--yrs or Fagin's--who
knows?  Apart from the my vs. yr generational tenor of his comments I  think
that he's pretty sharp about the derivativeness of the kinds of things
you'll
see in the NYC zines.

Ok--so if I say you should aspire to write as well as Stevens & Eliot--or
let's get even more ridiculous--Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, Dante, etc.--how
could you do it?  YOU CAN'T.  The instrument's broken.  Why should artistic
genres have an infinite lifespan?

When Fagin says that the payoff for writing poetry is inconsequential, I
tend
to believe him.  Jim, do you think that by yr generational logic yr poetry
is
going to get the shot at some wider attention than his got?  I think it's
maybe better to think for oneself than to think for one's generation (an
impossibe burden).  That's how to begin at least to talk honestly to oneself
about art--something tremendously difficult to do.

Wystan,

Polke is for me still a terrific & inspiring artist--my problem was that i
made too easy analogies across generic boundaries.  Greenberg thru de Duve
is
as you know an interest of mine.  & my end of poetry rants track w/ danto's

dear jacques,
             and further to my other point. Giving up poetry is not the same
as giving up literature, so if you aren't going to write poetry, what are
you writing is the question?
Or, is it really literature one gives up on?
             and so, with de Duve on my mind still:  he makes a distinction
between painting--which may be dead--and generic art, which may have
replaced it, via minimalism. Initially via Duchamp.  Can we say that L=
poetry is generic literature? Writing as opposed to poetry?

In a recent, unpublished, work-in-progress, ongoing e-mail collaboration between
Geoffrey Cruickshank-Hagenbuckle and Jeffrey Jullich (School of Jeffries

Hello all,


does anyone know where I can get copies of those black and white early video era
NPB poetry series documentaries about Olson, Duncan, Zukofsky and others?  What
is the deal with the SF poetry center archive?  I can't find a listing (on their
website) of what they have available to rent/sell --and they don't respond to
email.

OX DAY

It is said that the Ox day is suitable for broiling eels.

UZAKU broiled eel, thinly sliced cucumber,
and wakame seaweed marinated in rice vinegar
(very refreshing!).........$4.50

o  -  o  -  o  -  o  -  o

In EDO period, there was HARUKIYA ZENBEI
at an eel shop in Kanda. On a summer day, TOUDOU
who was a daimyo, placed an order with him
for a lot of broiled eels. So, he kept on broiling eels
for three days (the Rat, the Ox and the Tiger),
and he put them into an earthenware pot on each day.

    BEAT A HEAD FIRS T,
    AND    PIERCE WITH
    A SKEWER. CUT EELS
    IN   2 PIESE  FROM
    THE BACK   USING A
    KITC  HEN   KNI FE.

"What's a daimyo anyway?"
The word daimyo is Japanese from "dai,"
meaning "great" and "myo,"
part of the word for a private field.
Transliterate, therefore, as "great field."

     TAKE THE LIVER
     A ND THE B ONE.
     WHEN G RILL IT,
     SO AS   NOT TO
     BECOME   ROUND,
     CU T   A  BODY.

On the appointment day, he took out the broiled eel
from the pot. Then, the eel broiled on the Rat
and the Tiger day discolored and tasted bad,
but the eel broiled on the Ox day didn't change.

o  -  o  -  o  -  o  -  o

Mr Vinning chuckled and sipped his sake. He said a knowledge of festivals
and customs gave exporters an indication of where to direct their marketing
efforts. He said that these festivals are often a lot longer and more
refreshing than western celebrations, extending food export opportunities.

"For example, at Chinese New Year there is a tradition of conspicuous
refreshment, with very high demand at four and five star hotels. Fish is
also in demand during the new year as a show of wealth," Mr Vinning intoned
knowledgeably. "As a fish exporter it would make sense to target these
hotels just before and during the festival."

"Some festivals are very refreshing! On Ox-Day in China everyone eats eels
-- this could be a niche opportunity for an exporter."

Mr. Vinning folded up his chart and looked out at the ocean.

o  -  o  -  o  -  o  -  o

So it is said that the Ox day is suitable for broiling eels.

(very refreshing!)



CLUES FOR SWIMMERS

Narrow down the bears until they are half
or three quarters a cup of coffee.
Then, add anvils.



STARBUCKS

I love people,
and what working at Starbucks has allowed me to do
is get involved in people's lives.



FLICKERS

Everybody loves flickers
because (a) they eat ants, (b) have hollow bones
and (c) minimal cartilage, (d) dive majestically,
(e) enrage other birds, (f) have
brightly colored feathers, and (g) go
gracefully into the sunset.

Cheers everyone!

If anyone knows Edwin Torres' e-mail address, I'd very much appreciate a
backchannel.  I'm working out the 2001-2002 Visiting Writers Program at SUNY
Farmingdale and I'm considering putting him on the program if he's available
and willing.  Edwin has read for us in the past.  Our students loved him.
Thanks.  Best, Bill

I could add a few to the list myself

Edmund Berrigan's work is strange and devestating.  Karen Weiser writes
poems that are beautiful, sublime, sad music.  Brenda Bordofsky's work to
quote is "violently beautiful."  Anslem Berrigan keeps me in tears and in
laughter simultaneously.  Greg Fuchs blinds me with his humor, politics and
vast understanding of humanity in this shady world.  And John Coletti not
only reads brilliantly but his work sounds like bursts of song sewn together
with unfiltered and beautifully strange word structures.  I could go on and
on but I just wanted to add a few...

Hi Marianna,

I like the poets you mention, but didn't mention them myself (nor many of my
own favorites: Nada Gordon, Mitch Highfill, Chris Stroffolino, etc.) because
Jim Behrle already had & my list was supposed to be an addition to that.

I did make two boo-boos, though: Jim already mentioned Edwin Torres, so
strike him from my list. :^(

I somehow managed to transpose Peter Neufeld & Dan Machlin. The Glass Owl
book is Peter's. Duh.

Thanks!

Gary

Um... a typo, I think, Jacques.  One reference book I have lists the
publication date of _Axel's Castle_ as 1931.  So yes, that IS more than 40
years ago, innit?

Hi all, trying to find a way to continue this very interesting
Jacques-inspired conversation without getting my Ire-ish up too much.
Jacques of course says very provocative, pointed things which can appear
hurtful, and may well be, to the very invested.  To wit, his attack on
O'Hara and the preposterous suggestion that "More than anything he ever
actually wrote, it was a dune buggy on a beach in Fire Island that
launched Frank O'Hara as a p-o-e-t."  It is interesting to have found, in
the course of this conversation, opinions by Jacques which seem the very
opposite of my own, particularly given the fact that in the past we have
agreed on so much, including the wonderful-ness of Frank O'Hara.  But as
he himself has suggested, having given up the writing of poetry, he seems
to have had something like a conversion experience.  "He that is
spiritually enlightened truly apprehends and sees it, or has a sense of
it," says Jonathan Edwards - hence the tone of Jacques' recent offerings,
and his insistence on the category of "intuition" (tho he has yet to
define it in a useful way) provides the perfect companion for this tone.

Now, it would be typical of me to leap to O'Hara's aid at this point -- as
I'm guessing many of you out there feel like doing.  I suggest that we
don't, except in the way Kasey suggested we should by discussing the work
in some detail.  As I said, Jacques' view is the very opposite of mine: it
strikes me that O'Hara's death, while it may have made him famous/infamous
has in fact inhibited (greatly) the reading of his work.  In fact, the
tragic narrative made available by his death is what provides most of the
validation for the specious categories Jacques hangs his hat on: "white
negroism, homosexual anxiety,  art heroism, Day-Glo existential
hipsterism, and uptown/downtown 2-timing."  It's utterly peculiar to me
that Jacques would mention my work on O'Hara, which he has read, and then
hang a tag like "White Negro" (and here I hope he is being precise enough
that he is connecting O'Hara to the characterizations in Mailer's essay
rather than using the term as a writer for Newsweek would) when my work on
O'Hara (which he hyberbolically called "brilliant) does nothing if not
debunk the comparison of Mailer and O'Hara.

Jacques, you certainly must know, that to say that I write about O'Hara
from a biographical perspective (and thus suggest an affinity between my
work and Gooch's) says very little about the work.  True enough, I don't
drop a lovable postmodern theory on top of the work all biographical facts
to the contrary, but I'd hardly call it biographical criticism.  The
lynchpin of the piece I have coming out in Contemporary Literature, after
all, is a ten page reading (a re-visioning, I'd say) of "The Day Lady
Died" the conclusion of which is a very careful parsing of the final
stanza - a discussion, in short, of prosody.  Having discovered in
O'Hara's unpublished letters, a note in which he provided his publisher
with a meticulous revision of the linebreaks in one of his poems (can't
remember which just now) I had the stunning thought that maybe O'Hara
actually cared about how his poems looked on the page, imagine that.  This
"close reading" as they used to say, segues with a discussion of the "new
thing" jazz being played at the Five Spot at the time which, Baraka tells
me, interested O'Hara quite a bit.  Now, you can argue, if you like, that
O'Hara was putting Baraka on because he wanted to get in his pants or
something to that effect, but I'll take Baraka's word for it under the
assumption that our great! poets don't simply live their lives as if
following a bad soap opera script.

Even the excerpt I'm discussing is a bit too long for the List but my
point is simple: your misrepresentation of my work is symptomatic of your
take on O'Hara: I dare say it amounts to a repression.

There is one more thing to say about your disparagement of the
"biographical," though.  It suggests a, I think, flawed view of the
relationship between the Self and the aesthetic object.  Your privileging
of the notion of "involuntariness of intuition in aesthetic experience"
clashes in an interesting way with your notion of an "imaginative exertion
demanded of *individuals* to account for that experience."  Demanded by
who, and for what?  Since you don't admit the category of the social (or
at the very least keep it at a distance from the aesthetic), you're
hard-pressed to explain why anything would or should be demanded of anyone
and what the result would be, beyond epiphany, if that demand were met.
This is the reason that you yourself can offer the surest of judgements
regarding the greatness of Eliot and who's better than who but can't
begin, it seems, to explain why, for what, for whom.  Despite the fact
that you can't explain why anyone should give a lick about any of this,
you nonetheless see it as a "demand."  What you're talking about Jacques
is, finally, a "calling."  Your theoretical perspective, if you don't mind
my saying so, owes an awful lot to Puritan thinkers like Edwards, Mather,
-- not necessarily a bad thing, those fellas, like yourself, are very
complicated, interesting thinkers (albeit prone to the occasional rash
judgement and not a little pontificating), but it would seem to me that
"faith" is necessarily a central aspect of your theory.

Your critique then, would decry the devaluation of aesthetic experience in
a manner not unlike Edwards decried the devaluation of religious
experience during the Great Awakening.  I would argue that what I do
doesn't amount to a devaluation but rather focuses attention, Williams
James-style on the Varieties of Aesthetic Experience - trying hard, with
varying degrees of success, to explain why one might want to have one in
the first place.

Lastly, you're right to suggest that Hickey disagrees with you in
important respects -- I think in spirit as well, at least in the context
of your latest posts.  As a self-proclaimed pragmatist, Hickey sees
aesthetic choices, aesthetic experiences as socially symbolic acts, albeit
one's which call for endless debate, dialogue, explanation.  Hell, this is
why he cares in the first place about the art object contextualized to
"provide occasions for mastery" and this is why he seeks a
decontextualization which *fundamentally* changes the object as such by
setting it in motion, by making it *available*. In every sense of that
word (including the sexual one).  Fuck art, fuck with art, you know.
Hickey's interest in beauty, it seems to me, is not unlike Jameson's
interest in utopia: both, taking a page from Burke, see in these two
gestures, a socially symbolic act which can awaken both dissatisfaction
and, especially, desire. Incidentally, nobody uses beauty/utopia in this
way better than O'Hara, to my mind: quite in agreement with Hickey, I'd
say, he uses "personality as a consequence of reciprocal exteriority" to
posit a lovingly democratic world.  Bully for him.

My employment of Hickey in an attempt to argue against, you, Jacques, is
funny, given that you were the person that turned me on to Hickey in the
first place.  And I must say you owe him a more strenuous argument than
the mere acknowledgement of disagreement you've posted so far.  Either
that or a mea culpa.  Berryman indeed!  Though I have an old sift spot for
him, his work has the emotional range of a heartsick teenager, learned tho
he may bee.

I like my voodoo, and the 100s of poets e-mailed
to this list in a couple of messages, Gary's especially.
My list was of poets I admire.  I don't know what
"important work" is. I'm not sure why reclusive
poets feel they must lecture about something they
must not know anything about. I'm greatly looking
forward to seeing more of the work from the folks
I listed, and from others.

I appreciate all the backchannels from the list--
I look forward to more.  Thanks, everyone.

--Jim

Michael Magee--

not only is O'Hara a much better
poet than Eliot, Eliot isn't even that great.




And not only that I'd much rather hang out with O'Hara!


Is Fagin the one Ange Mlinko interviewed in PPNL, who complained of the
younger gen's overinterest in the recent past? If not, pardon me Mr. Fagin!
If so, I thought it a strange comment whoever made it, a comment no doubt
containing some truth, but then again, I would more tend to think it's the
olders with an overinterest in a particular recent past. Which is only to
say, I didn't recognize myself or my reading as having such an overinterest,
tho perhaps that depends on one's definition of both the words recent and
young. (ie perhaps I am no longer young, alors -- tho for an architect I
certainly am).

In the brainclear that follows dismissing oneself from the computer, I
realize that it is my guess that the comment to which I referred in my
previous post today was made not by Larry Fagin but by Charles North.
However I may be still incorrect as the source materials have been taken to
the SPT office as of this point. In any case, apologies for my very own
confusion, and still presume the comment might add a further flavor to the
thread.

Jacques, I think lots of them *are* riveting.  And, you're right
about my naming prosy excessive people--these are close to my heart
and came to mind first.  But excess has been an ongoing impulse in
poetry--from before Whitman to Anne Waldman and beyond.

You mention Hickey and Edmund Wilson.  Yikes!  As you know, reality
can be view through many windows and I think you've been looking
through a conservative, reactionary window.  My advice: look
elsewhere.

Hi Robert,
Just saw this (my online reading ability is at memory loss level).  Thanks!
I don't know how to backchannel anymore because the emails don't come up.
What can we do about that?

one might say, hysterically catholic.  for a truly strange reading
experience (assuming you are more skeptical than he is), read "Things
Hidden Since the Foundation of the World"--though it is one of the truly
great examples of someone simply ignoring or rejecting counterevidence in
order to make argument.  as I recall, he simply rejects the parts of the
Bible that seemingly contradict him.  it's much more pleasing to apply the
strictures he does to other religions back to X-tianity:  after all, this
is a religion where the Savior's blood is drunk every week (at least after
transubstantiation, which may or may not be still Vatican policy--I'm not
up these things).  that said, he is much more interesting on literature:
check out Deceit, Desire and the Novel.

Richard -

Because I said so!  One can know about one's own subjectivity even if one
doesn't know about one's own self or.  To restate, I know, because I know
how I feel.  That's it!  Actually, I tend to lean TOWARDS NYCPo, but
partially because I was raised in that region of the planet & so the voices
sound familiar in their own odd ways.

And thank you for observing where I was making distinctions.  I think in a
way that my saying "there's a lot of bad poetry around" sadly enough makes
people feel nervous.  It's a very Kafkaesque situation and by accident I end
up as the guy in the tower, with all of these judgments.  But hey, when it
comes to writing, I'm extremely opinionated about everybody's work.  So
what?  Hasn't everyone met an opinionated Yankee before, even one who
doesn't have the credentials to justify the opinions?  Poetry's perhaps the
only place in my life where I always know what I'm looking for even if I've
never seen it.  The poetry of certain writers just leaps off the page for
me.  Linh Dinh, for example.  There's nothing exactly spectacular about the
surfaces of his poems, but they are like the surface of a pot of water just
before boil.  All of the conflict, the reason for the poem to BE, all that
energy just quietly softly bending the surface in his poems.  I myself am
"guilty" of the intellectual poem, writing something just to achieve
something formally or to make a point.  And those are my worst poems.  They
might be "interesting" or complicated at best but they are never beautiful
except perhaps to accountants and physicists who accidentally ended up in
writing (and I am that person at least in part).  Big deal.  My ego isn't at
stake.

>   I think that in the present time there are thousands of brilliant poets:
> young and old.

And I have no problem with that even if I differ and say that there are
thousands of brilliant folks who occasionally write a Pretty Good Poem and
rarely write a Really Good Poem.  I hope you don't have a problem with our
differences!

>  Ok. There is a place for "darkness" and "passion"...how to integrate that

I'd say it's damn near impossible to contrive such an integration.  But I
can make a guess.  Work for years and write write write.  Try many new
things, reject certain things, accept others.  Think about your writing, try
again, share it, pull it back, and keep trying.  Keep tinkering.  LOVE the
tinkering.  Be unable to live without the tinkering, the reading, the
processing.  Then suddenly something really amazing or horrible happens to
you and all of that energy can just sort of come together and there you are
writing writing writing but this time you have something really horrible or
amazing to say when you are writing writing writing.  And with all of the
books out there, I can spend a little time finding these horrible or amazing
things and pretty much be able to read every day reading the things I chose
to read, instead of just reading everything that comes my way (just as this
e-mail may be deleted upon sight of my e-mail address).

thanks,
Patrick

You paint with a broad brush.  No need to go after feminists.  It's the

Mike,

A few things:

1.  Only a mad scientist reading would lead you to find the kinds of
references that you uncover in my post to yr (not hyperbolically, but
genuinely) brilliant dissertation.  Commenting on my own dissertation, my
first reader remarked to me how, despite the fact that I was discussing
so-called advanced writers like O'Hara, I seemed to rely on biographical data
to advance my thesis.  It struck me then that, as neither a positive nor a
negative judgement, how widespread this treatment of O'Hara is--for instance,
most notably, in Perloff.  In fact I think that your, her, and my own
analyses are perfectly ok.  But I believe we should pay attention to & notice
what we're doing.  It is significant, isn't it, that postmodern poetries are
not really susceptible to postmodern reading strategies which are all aimed
in a sense at uncovering the texts "unconscious"?

2.  If I hadn't written as late at night as I am now doing and w/ as much
haste, there would not have been dashes, but equal signs between the letters
of O'Hara's name.  Then it would have been more apparent to you that what I
was "fucking with" (as you say Hickey suggests we do) was not the poet, but
the p=o=e=t;  not O'Hara, but the sacred cow he has become.  Mike, I suspect
that you only want to fuck art and fuck w/ art when the target is an easy or
a safe one, but what's the point of that?  I love O'Hara, but I'm beginning
to get bored w/ O'Hara idolatry & mimicry.  & of course Kasey is right--the
only way you can change someone's mind about a poem is to force him or her
back to it.

3.  Which leads me to tell you about the time I was in the Grolier poetry
bookstore w/ a friend of mine.  He'd found a book of poems that, after
reading around in for a few minutes, he'd become enthusiastic about and
wanted to show me.  I noticed who the publisher was though (Knopf or
something) and kind of waved him off **w/out looking at it.**  Afterwards I
realized that I'd become an av-garde snob & know-nothing.  Dave Hickey and
Edmund Wilson, for instance, are merely reactionaries according to this
logic.  Greenberg is just an obscurantist.  Berryman has a teenager's
emotional range.  Etc., you see.  But like I say I slowly began to realize
how narrow my reading had become & how much I'd begun to cut myself off from.

4.  What I like to do is this:  to take 2 seemingly antithetical but
compelling positions (like Greenberg's & Hickey's) & to see what they have to
say to each other.  It's not that I deny the social aspect of poetry at all,
but that in this particular thought experiment I place a heavier emphasis
than Hickey does in some moods on the individual's reception of art as a
private experience (a more apolitical, but not de-politiciized approach).
Greenberg, by contrast, would find my treatment *too* invested in
relativisms.  But you respond to my posts w/ straw men, as if I needed to be
lectured for instance on the mysticism of epiphanical experience.  I can
think by the numbers too, but instead, I'm giving myself permission to play
around w/ ideas that are actually very much in the air today--the revival of
interest in the artword in Greenberg, for instance.  **& I don't know why we
can't begin to talk more simply and directly about art.  Mike, Greenberg says
correctly that "value judgements sneak back in" to every discussion of art,
"unacknowledged, surreptitiously, inadvertantly.  The art writer, the art
lecturer tends to leave them out , but he (sic) is too confused to know when
they come in."  The posts criticizing me in this thread are rife w/ examples.


5.  Finally, it's not poetry that I've been converted away from, but coeterie
artistic practice.  In reality poets in NYC & SF are not at all shy about
making aesthetic weather reports, but in coeteries this is done privately--in
bars, at parties, but *never* in magazines & on listservs in part on the
nail-that-sticks-out-theory.  I'm less interested than I had been before in
private languages and socially closed aesthetic situations--as maybe
everybody should be who doesn't make frequent trips to NYC or SF where
reputations accrue thru assiduous insider trading.

Wystan, thank you for the de Duve explication.  I've only read Pictorial
Nominalism and Duchamp After Kant so I can tell you know the work better than
i do.  What am I writing now?  Not literature-in-general exactly, but
fiction.

& I will also follow Kasey's very wise policy of letting 20 (or more) e-mails
appear on this thread before responding again--which will most likely mean
never.

feels came from a very intense torment on the relationship of language to
truth etc but Jaques, unless he was "having us on a bit" is more "old
fogeyistical" than than Patrick. Mind you actual age is not inquestion here
neccessarily as I like to think I feel (mind not body!) better than some
young people. So, to round off, I agree in principle with your "bullshits".
Regards, I'm following the "trail" of the Re:Why I was a bad poet emails so
have a lot more coming up, Richard.

Aaron. I'm not Jim by the way..but I loved my parents music which was mostly
classical. Maybe they liked songs from the 20s and thirtys. The conflict
doesnt need to be that intense. by the way who'se like me and hates to fall
asleep early and then I wake up and start reading or having coffee and
playing Chess on ICC or studying the emails or whatever (usually everything
but what I "should" be doing.)When I've finished this bio of Swinburne I'll
start back on Life, a User's Manual which IS fascinating. What I've read of
Perec so far I like greatly. But I fear the dark still, I suppose: and yet I
love it. Richard.

This from Emma Yates in the Guardian =

" He writes that Plath mistakenly swallowed pills which prompted her =
suicidal feelings and this was the "key factor" in the 1963 tragedy.=20
Although Hughes does not name the particular drug in his letters, he =
claims that whilst living in America Plath had suffered an adverse =
reaction to some prescribed pills. When they moved to Britain, the drug =
was sold under a different name and prescribed by her new doctor who was =
unaware of her reaction. Hughes writes in the letter, "she was aware of =
its effects which lasted about three hours... just time enough."



I'd like to see a good psychiatric investigation of the actual =
pharmacology involved but this is a plausible scenario in my experience =
and sheds new light on possible diagnoses of SP.  It also adds another =
dimension to earlier discussions here regarding substances and poetic =
expression?  Especiaaly interesting in re current fads for youthful =
recreational use of anti-depressants.

Jordan Davis (spitting Red Man juice), responding to the Greenbergian idea that we must give our 'all' in  aesthetic engagements said:

"Yes, we have to get 100% of our affect behind that Olitsky pink mist, or nobody will buy it. You all still afraid to pitch to me, Jordan."

Alright, slugger. The point would be that anybody will buy anything now.

Especially in poetry SoHo, where umbrella drinks are in, and reproductions are all the rage.

Though I wish to be clear: I am a minor leaguer (middle reliever recently put on waivers by the Patmos Pre-Socratics, where Bill Luoma is also playing presently); I know Jordan Davis (what a great name for a baseball player!) is in the Big Show.

Jacques, I realize you end up getting tarred and feathered in these
discussions and I should have been more sensitive to that in my latest
post, and less defensive myself.  My use of Edwards was a way - a fairly
poor one I see now - to draw you out into a more specific discussion of
the nature of aesthetic experience and it's value, if those things can be
talked about at all from where you're standing.  Hey: I really do admire
your willingness to work your ideas out in a public forum.  I wonder what
would have happened if the discussion hadn't been originally framed as a
who's better than who discussion.  I share, completely, your frustration
over the coterie-sanctioned O'Hara: I feel like I'm wading against it much
of the time.  But I don't agree, I guess, with the logic of attempting to
dismantle a present sacred cow by resusitating a past one.  And I have
what seem to me very very good and articulate-able reasons for thinking
O'Hara a "better" poet than Eliot.

My comment about Berryman was needlessly flip, but I want to let you  know
that I know John Berryman's work like the back of my hand - not just the
Dream Songs but the Collected Poems too - I've written about Homage to
Mistress Bradstreet, and I used to LOVE "Sonnets to Chris": the line
from #73, "stumbles someone to the latch strap" has stuck with me for a
decade: he had the whole sound of the Dream Songs already, right there.
Then last year I thought I'd go back to the Dream Songs, having written
all that stuff about Ellison, and maybe write about the minstrelsy there.
But it turns out, I think, that there's not enough there there, it's
fairly predictable as its employed by an, as I still say, emotionally
limited guy who loved Bessie Smith.  In positive addition, I'll say that
he has a wonderful ear and can be quite funny in a sad-sack sort of way.

Well, look, no need to push this rank list. Berryman's completely worth
reading and all the rank-logic does is make one sound as if your saying
*don't read so-and-so*.   What I said in the begining holds true: any
viciousness on my part reflects my urgent interest in your continuing to
write *writing* - forget the word poetry - and in the hope that you won't
necessarily mistake the earnest community for the coterie.

Your friend,  Mike.

Hi all,

I'm sorry to have to let you know that Rachel Raffler died this week.
Rachel was a brilliant young poet and a wonderful person.  She took a
Creative Writing class with me in 1998 and subsequently published in
COMBO. We kept in touch, emailing about once a month, thru this past June.
I'm so, so sad about this and don't know many details yet but some of you
knew Rachel or had read her poems - a handful of you had specifically
written me to say how much you liked them - and I thought it right to let
you know. In her last email to me she'd mentioned that she'd decided to
volunteer at the Poetry Project, tho I don't know if she ever did. Her
poems can be found in COMBOs 3 & 7. And her reading at Live at The Writers
House can be found here (Week 10):

Subject:      Silliman's list
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi Jacques,

I remember Silliman's list. There weren't 160 poets named. There were more
like 80-something. The other 80-odd poets referred to in that "160" were
those published in In the American Tree, Language Poetries and The Art of
Practice.

I realize of course that 100 pp. is totally arbitrary. But still ...

I guess I'm baffled by your assertion that Ron couldn't possibly have read
16,000 pages of poetry by these people. You mean you don't read at least
that much poetry in a year? You don't get a lot of manuscripts in the mail &
handed to you at readings & other events by fellow poets? Or write to poets
who you've heard about or have read maybe a few things by & request them to
send you more? I sort of assumed that was what we all did, especially
younger poets who don't have books coming out all the time. As Kenny
Goldsmith likes to say, it's largely a "gift culture."

It's hard to believe that Ron hadn't read 100 pages by everyone in American
Tree and LP (assuming everyone in those anthologies wrote that much, and
probably most had, by the time his afterword to Practice was published), and
it seems equally far-fetched that he hadn't read 100+ pp. by the people in
Practice by the time of its publication in 1994.

I'm going over Silliman's list right now, at work, which includes names of
80-something people whose work he loves who are not in the three above-named
anthologies. (He does say they're "doing important work," but he also
qualifies that, earlier, by saying that it's his own configuration, and that
any configuration by another would be different.)

Anyway, I'm amazed at how many I'd read at least 100 pages by (by 1994). I'm
younger than Ron, and this isn't even my personal pantheon, it's part of his
own:

Kathy Acker (Great Expectations, Blood & Guts in High School, etc.), Charles
Alexander (Hopeful Buildings is at least that long, and was published prior
to 94; I also read things of his in manuscript, plus another book published
by Segue), Michael Amnasan (he had at least one 100+ page manuscript being
passed around that I read in the 80s), Bruce Boone (I may be fudging a bit,
probably more like 50-75?, anyway, you never read The Truth About Ted or his
collaboration of translations with Robert Gluck, La Fontaine?), Nicole
Brossard (Picture Theory), Gerald Burns (I'd read hundreds of pages by him,
almost all in manuscript, though he had at least two 100-page books out by
94, Shorter Poems and Letters to Obscure Men), Bill Corbett (many books in
print by 94), Lydia Davis (many books in print by 94, hereafter "MBIP"),
Christopher Dewdney (MBIP), Barbara Einzig (at least two books in print I'd
read by 94, Life Moves Outside being the title I remember), George Evans
(I'm sure he had a good sized Coffee House Press book out by that time that
I read, or no to be honest skimmed through), Ben Friedlander (MBIP), Ed
Friedman (more books since 94, but I'd read the Telephone Book, which was
pretty long), Amy Gerstler (lots in print), Michael Gizzi (lots of chaps &
Continental Harmony), Robert Gluck (Jack, the Modernist was one of THE books
we were all reading at SF State in the 80s, plus the Marsha Poems, Elements
of a Coffee Service, Reader), John Godfrey (Dabble and Where the Weather
Suits My Clothes), Bob Harrison (I definitely had 100 or nearly 100 pp. in
manuscript from him by 94), Leland Hickman (can't remember how long Great
Slave Lake Suite is! but, pretty substantial, not to mention fabulous), Crag
Hill (several chaps, including this fantastic dictionary book he'd done with
images by Elizabeth Was), Andrea Hollowell (Nada says she saw 100 plus ms.
pages by her in the 80s, probably so did Ron, I can't say the same,
however), Ronald Johnson (please! too easy!), Lawrence Kearny (Five and
Streaming and I think several other books out prior to 94, though I
admittedly only read them recently), Kevin Killian (a couple of books of
stories, plus manuscripts & plays, hundreds of pages!), Joel Lewis (lots in
manuscript, but House Rent Boogie and Palookas of the Ozone had both been
published by then & I had other manuscripts), Lori Lubeski (a couple of
books, probably not 100 pages, but significant amount of work), Bill Luoma
(My Trip to New York, which isn't that long, but I'd also read a manuscript
by him he sent me by then, no doubt Ron had read several), Harryette Mullen
(Trimmings & S*perm*kt both out I think, less than 100, but still, c'mon),
Gale Nelson (I'm probably going to misspell his Stare Decis), bp Nichol (the
Martyrology, plus!), Maureen Owen (goes w/out saying?) Pat Reed (lots of
chaps and Kismet, from O), Jerome Sala (lots of books, his selected might
even have been out by 94, maybe not), David Shapiro (lots), Gail Sher
(lots), Susan Smith Nash (superamount tons), Gustof Sobin (plenty), Cole
Swenson (okay, so I only read Given, but there was lots out there by 94),
Lorenzo Thomas (The Bathers collected all or most of his chaps, well over
100 pp.), Chris Tysh & George Tysh (lots of books & chaps, plus the groovy
Everyday Life mag), Fred Wah (his selected poems alone is 100 pp., isn't
it?), Keith Waldrop (goes w/out saying), Rosmarie Waldrop (gw/os), John Yau
(plenty), Geoffrey Young (Subject to Fits, Rocks & Deals).

The other people on the list I can't say I read much by (by 1994), but I
don't have a real hard time imagining Ron having done that. Or at any rate
more than "a few poems."

Why is it so hard to believe that people read widely? Or that a lot of their
reading might be of material you personally might not be able to get through
interlibrary loan or amazon.com? Or that what they read might not somehow
matter, significantly, to them?

As Nada said last night, it seems to suggest (at least) two possible
approaches. One being immersion, which I think is true of Ron, Jim, Nada,
myself, my poet friends & a lot of people on this list. Poetry as your
environment. The other being more like you're looking at contemporary poetry
from the outside, as a kind of field of study. Not that Ron, Jim, me &
others don't study it, too. I mean, it's just that that seems like it might
be a limit for those not immersed?

I think it's true that there are relatively few people on the planet who you
could say are immersed in poetry, for whom poetry really does matter, on a
day to day basis in any significant way. For the person not immersed in
poetry, I can see how that realization might present a "problem" or "crisis"
or something.

But my life in poetry is not a problem or crisis. It's a particular space or
environment I've chosen to inhabit. The relative cultural or art-historical
value of Eliot and O'Hara, how various grad students might place O'Hara or
read &/or re-evaluate his work, or (my fave academic term) "inoculate" it,
tends to be of little consequence to that life. By "life," by the way, I'm
not pitching "raw experience" vs. "theory." I mean the "life of the mind,"
too. Mostly, in fact.

Nor do I mean to pitch academics vs. poets (Fagin isn't at all an academic,
he just isn't immersed in poetry as it exists today). I'm just seeing that,
yeah, Nada's right, there does seem to be a kind of split here, between
someone reading a map & making maps based on other maps, and people living
in the place itself, who do use maps, but who spend most of the time
involved in the environment itself.

Gary

fashion in the 20th century (really, from Worth in the 1880s, but, what they
hey) was the history of a movement from dressmakers and costumers to
"couturiers" -- it was a mechanization & a corporatization, with a curious
relationship to slave labor and international retail merchandizing --

I want to note a couple things.  The relationship of poets to the fashion
industry was close:  Blase Cendrars/Sonia Delaunay, Elsa Shiaparelli's first
book was a book of poems, she worked with Cocteau and others, incorporated
text of her reviews made into cloth into clothing -- I wonder if perhaps
fashion reviews have been a women's criticism -- to decry 20th century
"fashion" seems parallel to decrying 20th century fads in art, criticism,
etc.

The materialist aesthetics of food, clothing, and shelter, cooking, fashion,
and decorating, are female-oriented, female-dominated, and not completely
"feminized", while cuisine, couture, and construction are perhaps at least
returning to something equitable after all that 20th Century hubris.

BTW, if anyone can tell me how to get my hands on that Shiaparelli book...

Thomas.  I read that in a book I picked up by Alvarez (I think it was in
that) who describes her last day: he was one of the last to see her alive.
He wrote a whole book on suicide called  "The Savage God".(You or others on
the List are probably well aware of it.) Look, I've read the book, but (age
booze the odd pill popping? - ok its confessional time)  has or does affect
my memory so I've forgotten the guts of it but you may know the book. His
discussion of suicide starts out with a personal memoir of Plath. Actually,
squizing at it now, it looks to be a fascinating book: maybe not too
scientific...Alvarez has at least a sense of humour. He starts the last
chapter with: "After all this, I have to admit that I am a failed
suicide."!!!
 What happenned to Alvarez? Looks as though I might get diverted away from
Perec to Alvarez again! From memory the book was interesting but not very
uplifting!  Very interesting, but I'm sure that its there that I saw the
reference to her taking medication. The point being that some
anti-depressants, while they work eventually (if they are the "right"
drugs), initially either maintain the depression or can intensify the
effects. I suppose one day they will be able to control these things more
accurately. Will that be progress - is there such a thing?
  I took anti depressants in 1967 with valium and it semed ages but
eventually the depression "lifted". I was 19. I eventually threw away the
anti-depressants(orange tablets which were called Nortriptoline). So they
work: but more recently I have found that it - any defeat of depression -
has to come from my own inner thinking and will power or self-control etc
i've found that by anmd large, by utilising positive thinking  so to speak,
the very deep depression that I suffered for about 5 years has lifted. But
during that period (a period of marital separation) I wrote a lot more
poetry...so maybe there's something in Alvarez's thesis. The old one (I
suppose) connecting creativity with emotional sufferinhg etc (he goes
further and calls suicide the Savage God - well aware I presume of his
romaticizing stance).
   Long live surfeit and plethora. But long live the living. Regards,
Richard.

This from Emma Yates in the Guardian
http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,534006,00.html

" He writes that Plath mistakenly swallowed pills which prompted her
suicidal feelings and this was the "key factor" in the 1963 tragedy.
Although Hughes does not name the particular drug in his letters, he claims
that whilst living in America Plath had suffered an adverse reaction to some
prescribed pills. When they moved to Britain, the drug was sold under a
different name and prescribed by her new doctor who was unaware of her
reaction. Hughes writes in the letter, "she was aware of its effects which
lasted about three hours... just time enough."



I'd like to see a good psychiatric investigation of the actual pharmacology
involved but this is a plausible scenario in my experience and sheds new
light on possible diagnoses of SP.  It also adds another dimension to
earlier discussions here regarding substances and poetic expression?
Especiaaly interesting in re current fads for youthful recreational use of
anti-depressants.

EVERYTHING STOPS!  THE TIDE OF POETRY TURNS.
-----------------------------------
From Publishers Weekly:  "The Best Loved Poems of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis have
been selected by someone who should know: Caroline Kennedy. While Caroline's two
confirmed appearances on the Today Show, a first serial in Good Housekeeping, and
further publicity should make this easily the bestselling poetry title of the
season, it doesn't hurt that Jackie's taste was excellent. Charming poems from
John Clare, Kipling, and a young Jimmy Kennedy are complemented by work from
Langston Hughes, Robert Frost and Elizabeth Bishop and by 14 b&w family photos.
Caroline Kennedy has organized more than 100 poems into seven sections
("America"; "Adventure" etc.), written short, intimate introductions to each and
included a small selection of Jackie's own poems."
-----------------------------------
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.  She was no hick.  She ~must~ have read (or been at parties
and heard discussion of) ~everyone:~ O'Hara, John . . .  Candy Darling! . . .
It's only a very carefully pruned representation that would remain confined to
Frost, etc.  There's no saying.  100 poems in seven sections is a lot.  (What
might the five unnamed sections be!?  [eek!]  "New York"!!?  "Black Coffee and
Toast, Dark" [the only thing she was ever seen to order, by herself, sunglasses,
a working girl])  WHAT WILL JACKIE'S POETRY BE LIKE?!!!  It makes one cold all
over, yet heatful.

EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE OVER NIGHT.  If Oprah endorsed Joan Retallack . . .

("Jackie's taste was excellent")  I look forward to charming Clare poems
("showers of lady smocks so called by toil / When boys sprote gathering sit on
stulps" [sic, sic, sic])!  "Little Trotty Wagtail" would be a joy to hear on
audio, coming from a poet who escaped from a mental asylum and walked all the way
from Epping to Northamptonshire!  Wayne Koestenbaum must be in intensive care!

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had the same birthday as John Ashbery and Marcel
Duchamp.  Fact.

PREPARE FOR A COMPLETE REVERSAL OF ALL YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

Experimental Life Writing and/or Drawing

The next issue of Metaphor/Metonym for Health =
http://members.tripod.com/~trbell/metaphor/metapho.htm will publish =
experimental poetry, art. and webpoetry on illness (or life as illness =
or life as healing). Submissions will be accepted via email =
trbell@home.com or snail mail 2518 Wellington Place, Murfreesboro, TN =
37128, USA. Deadline will be November 1. I'm hoping to strike the wide =
range between 'poems by sick people' and 'great' literature and =
particularly interested in stylistic innovations (for you, that is) or =
combinations of styles (such as visual poetry). Each submission should =
be accompanied by a brief note on circumstances and how style =
facilitated the process of production or creation of the piece.

I am taking off here from Marion Milner (Joanna Field) when she says, =
"It was the discovery that it was possible at times to produce drawings =
or sketches in an entirely different way from any that I had been =
taught..." (_On Not Being Able to Paint_, NY, IUP, 1957). I am looking =
for work that lets "hand and eye do exactly what pleased them without =
any conscious working to apreconceived intention" in the Eastern =
European sense of writing process as experiment, hazard, a try.

Out of my own "perverse" interest at the moment in work that deals with =
confronting suicide or the borders of sanity/in as in the Bada Shanren =
perplexity, I'm particularly intrigued by these two questions, but not =
limited to these areas.

The new Publishers Weekly contains short reviews of two Green Integer =
titles:

"Some exclamatory and heartfelt, others mordant, whimsical or surreal, =
the pieces in Suites by Federico Garacia lorca (1989-1936) are early, =
short-lined poetic sequences, here translated by the prolific Jerome =
Rothenberg. "In the little woodlets / with their purples & magnesiums / =
the princesitas jumping /are baby sparkadillos." Many of these component =
poems and versets by Spain's master have never before appeared in =
English. (Green Integer, $12.95 paper 240 p ISBN 1-892295-61-X)

The restless, energetic verse of Prague's surrealist writer Vitezslav =
Nezval (1900-1958) should delight and excite American readers; the urban =
rambles, lists and erotic promises of his Antilyrik & Other Poems echo =
Whitman, Apollinaire and Rimbaud: "Tell me you reed bouquet / What city =
in the guts was I just crossing." The above Jerome Rothenberg and Czech =
expatriate Milos Sovak accompany their translation with a biographical =
postscript. (Green Integer, $11.95, paper 160 p ISBN 1-892295-79-X)

Michael:

A bit off the point -- I first came across the "Chris" (rather than "Lise")
version in the Collected Poems edition.  Presumably Berryman (sic? not the
publishers?).  It threw me then and it still throws me.  I prefer the
original (-ly published) version.  That had already been left to cool for --
what? -- 15 years -- so presumably Berryman's use of "Lise" then (1965?) was
'deliberate'.

Be interested in what you (and everyone else) thinks on this.

Chris,

I must thank you for posting this about Cabinet.  I had heard of the
Christian Bok sci-fi language from a Double Happiness reading flyer, but
couldn't attend.  So, I ordered Cab' # 1.  Best reading, listening
para-poetry experience I've had in days.  The CD of Charles reading his
babel, and Bok's Schwitters, and McCaffrey were tremendously liberating for
me,--- and, all in all, the issue's focus on private languages/glossolalia
was just what I needed.  It was like a salubrious spa salt wrap, and my
skin is more lustrous and vital, my pores blinking.

Thanks.

Jeffrey Jullich

Has this "deceit" been publicly acknowledged?  Have you 'fessed up?  (On the List, etc.  I'm a little bit Rip van Winkel-ish in having missed
about a year and a half while underground. The thing to be in doubt about now is: the existence of Jacques Debrot.  "Jacques Debrot" is the
name of the cultural minister of Antilles.)  The poems are very masterfully done.  I suspected that they were forgeries, too, mainly because
they combine chronologically different styles of John's.  The interview too does a very good job of reproducing certain speech patterns from
other interviews of his,--- but, of course, there are then things there that John would never in a thousand years allow his name to be attached
to.  --- Jeffrey

Are you aware that http://www.literaryhistory.com/20thC/Ashbery.htm unwittingly gives the URL for your falsification, alongside authentic

Have you contacted them to make them aware of their error, or was it your intention to raise your dishonesty to that next level?

Jeffrey,

You are most welcome. If glossolalia interests, you might look, too, into
the work of Aaron Williamson. He performed in Buffalo and Toronto last
year, and I was utterly taken with him. His piece Hearing Things is
available on the web at
<http://www.ruskin-sch.ox.ac.uk/lab/workprac/aaron/> - though I must say
that, elaborately set, it is less physically immediate than what he did
here, for which the sole prop was his own body. I could only describe the
work in contradictions, as a sort of "occluded vaticination" or "orphic
stoppage" improvised, as he later told me, on the basis of memorized texts
- poems, snippets of childish rhyme, the spellings of various words
including his own name. In Toronto, he did use an old wooden chair, which
he dragged part-way across the floor with his belt. It sounds simple - even
comically so - but the difficulty of his manner was such that the action
not only suggested but in fact disclosed a tremendous play of force and
counter-force. He's much more directly inspired by Artaud than most
Canadian and American poets/performers - more "athletic" in Artaud's sense,
and much closer to the cusp of the irrational; "metaphysical" as Susan Howe
would say. Really sort of frightening, and I loved it.

friends,

I'd like to say there are no great poets only great poems and for themost part even
the  "greatest"  poets that "everybody" has heard of, are remembered for one poem
or one book.  I agree with Dodie, Jacques primarily argues from the conservative and
occasionally from the reactionary side of the aisle. And speaking of reactionaries, I
agree with Ezra Pound: it takes one to know one, so I'd give more weight to Dodie's
comments because I've seen more "great" work from her.
But I must confess, I've been blessed with direct contact with a few of the "great"
poets including Muriel Rukeyser and Charles Olson And doubly blessed to be friends
of Allen Ginsberg, Ed Dorn, Robert Duncan, Bob Creeley and Robin Blaser and what makes these
poets great above and beyond the great poems they've written is their concern for the art
in general and encouragement of and accessability to other practitioners and promotion
of their work. And as far as greatness goes I'd have to say that Phil Whalen is the Emily
Dickinson of our day and she's the greatest.

Jeffrey Jullich asked, in reference to the formal citation on the "Literary
History" website of Jacques Debrot's exciting interview with John Ashbery:

>Have you contacted them to make them aware of their error, or was it >your
>intention to raise your dishonesty to that next level?

Two questions.

1) Should that be "raise" or should that be "lower"? (It seems to me that
one could make a case for this interview occupying a decidedly higher ground
vis a vis the soiled and dreadful "level" at which  "Authorial Stardom" and
"Literary History" are fused by the superglue of ideology [works on all
surfaces!] into a kind of Minotaur who has his way with all the poetry
youths and maidens who stumble into its manure-ridden labyrinth. I mean,
excuse me for that drawn out sentence, but one should remember all those
nasty things they said about the lovely boy Chatterton, that saintly little

2) If you asked John Ashbery for his opinion concerning his interview with
Jacques Debrot, do you think he would bounce and scowl like Jeffrey Jullich
at its "dishonesty", or do you think he would clap his trout-shaped glass
hands with delight?

The poem is about the potential nature of the human spirit.



The idea was to take a relevant poem off of the page, print it on objects
and place them around a large, actively populated area. This would have the
reader engage a poem, in all of its disgusting glory, on a form that would
be easy to digest and reflect the area it was in. This blends a garden
walking tour with a fun house, having exhibits of a large poem, having no
real beginning or real ending, [as in traditional literature, this negates
the linear narrative] operating as one over a large space so the reader
could engage the poem from any angle. This method also allows for multiple
meanings and readings as all interactive texts have differing entry and exit
points

Richard,
     the reason I posted the article was that anti-depressants are much more
complicated than people realize.  It's not a black/white kind of thing and
as you point out doctors are only now starting to understand what they do.
What it might turn out to mean though is that until that particular piece of
information is ferreted out, romantic speculations about Plath are no more
than that.

Jeffrey,

I suppose you feel angered and/or morally outraged by the interview & poems
and by the fact that I'd publish them, knowing what they were, and that's
what gives you the right to post and forward my private emails to you like
this? Okay, I guess I can understand that.

If you want, I'll tell you why I thought Jacques' interview and the other
person's "Ashbery" poems were worth publishing.

But not until (1) you can name the person who wrote the interview with John
Cage that embarrassed George Plimpton for five minutes and (2) can tell me
everything you know about Pierre Menard.

You seem to like being a private investigator. You'll have fun tracking
those two things down.

instigating text _Doubled Flowering:  from the Notebooks of Araki Yasusada_.=

Bill Friend, I think, can talk w/ more authority about Johnson's theories of=
=20

which the implications of post-modern authorship are relentlessly faced up t=

If all writers are of course *positioned*, writing itself is also, I'd argue=

a form of schizophrenia,  a "magical psychosis" of alternate selves and=20
proliferating coincidences.  Johnson himself writes from the position of=20
being nobody and nothing.  The abjectness of this strategy is apparent in hi=
s=20
sometimes humiliating behavior on various listservs.  But it has other=20
implications;  as Perloff notices, literary hoaxes are essentially end-runs=20
around the incestuous bureaucratic processes of cultural legitimation. =20
Johnson, moreover, continues to play out the Yasusada hoax (in ways that=20
perhaps no one is yet aware of) w/ an entirely new savoir-faire.  "Fooling=20
you" is for him practically only an ancillary aim.

_Doubled Flowering_ is itself more=E2=80=94but not at all less=E2=80=94than=20=
Yasusada's=20
extraordinarily beautiful notebook entries.   It's framed, if you haven't ye=

s=20
really like a po-mo novel--accessible in ways that much of po-mo writing=20

often fails to be.

Is it racist?  Does it present an exoticized--an in*authentic*--and a=20
sensationalized --as opposed to a *sincere*--version of Japanese culture? =20
The question itself reveals the deep investments we still retain in so-calle=
d=20
reactionary ideologies.  The premise of the book though is, from the pov of=20
perpetrating a hoax, ridiculous.  Jack Spicer of all people turns out,=20
improbably, to be Yasusada's principal influence.  The logistics of this=20
scenario (considering that Yasuada's latest work dates from 1972) are--think=
=20
about it for a second--impossible, really.  Not to mention all the other=20
fairly blatant anachronisms throughout the Yasusada notebooks.  Perloff=20
argues, for this reason, that Johnson, far from trying to pull off a fraud,=20
deliberately loads the book with clues as to its inauthenticity.  Perhaps. =20
But I think also that Doubled Flowering is, at its core, an historical=20

Of course, Bill Friend--not Andrew Felsinger--interviewed Kent Johnson,
apologies.  Though I have heard that Friend really is Felsinger . . .

Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a
go-with-the-flow style, or with a religious resignation to
the twists of fortune. Learning to adapt to each new
circumstance means seeing events through your own eyes, and
often ignoring the advice that people constantly peddle your
way. It means ultimately that you must throw out the laws
that others preach, and the books that they write to tell
you what to do, and the sage advice of the elder. The laws
that govern circumstances are abolished by new
circumstances. Rely too much on other people's ideas and you
end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much
respect for other people's wisdom will make you depreciate
your own. Be brutal with the past, especially your own, and
have no respect for the philosophies that are foisted on you
from the outside.

THE CCAC INSTITUTE PRESENTS ANNE CARSON’S
"DECREATION: FIGHT CHERRIES", AN OPERA INSTALLATION
Logan Galleries, California College of Arts and Crafts
1111 Eighth Street (at 16th and Wisconsin streets), San Francisco
Performances September 6, 7, 8, 13, 14 and 15 at 8 pm
Tickets $15; CCAC students, faculty, and staff free with current
identification
For more information please call (415) 551-9210.

Renowned poet and writer Anne Carson and acclaimed Bay Area composer
Guillermo Galindo will collaborate on Decreation: Fight Cherries, an opera
installation based on the life and thought of French philosopher Simone
Weil (1909–43). Fight Cherries is directed by Kenn Watt and stars Amy X
Neuburg as Simone Weil. The performance, conducted by Mary Chun, also
features singers Valentina Osinski, Richard Mix, and Gary Rushman. The
musicians are Paula Cekola, piano; Joel Davel, percussion; Donelle Page,
harp; and Ruth Stuart, oboe. Yim Lim is the set designer; Kim Anno is the
artistic designer.

Simone Weil was a philosopher, teacher, revolutionary, writer, ascetic and
mystic who, during her short life, worked in an automobile factory and
served as a soldier in the Spanish Civil War. Albert Camus called her “the
only great spirit of our time.” She died at age 34 in England of
tuberculosis, a condition exacerbated by her refusing to eat more than the
standard rations the Nazis allowed her compatriots in occupied France.

Anne Carson, a classically trained poet whose work references both ancient
and contemporary cultures, recently received a MacArthur “Genius” Award.
Her published works include Eros the Bittersweet; Glass, Irony and God;
Plainwater; Autobiography of Red; and a translation with commentary and
notes of Sophokles’ Elektra. Her most recent book is The Beauty of the
Husband (Knopf, 2001). She has received the Lannan Literary Award for
Poetry, the Pushcart Prize for Poetry and a Guggenheim Fellowship. She is
a professor of classics at McGill University in Montreal. This fall Carson
will be a visiting writer-in-residence in CCAC’s graduate writing program.

The work of Guillermo Galindo, which ranges from digital sound design for
media and live performance to chamber and orchestral composition, has been
published and performed around the world. Galindo is a sound specialist
and music research consultant at the Oakland Museum of California and has
written music for the San Francisco–based Asian American Dance
Performances for eight years.

Kenn Watt is the artistic associate of the Magic Theatre and the founder
and artistic director of the Fifth Floor company. He is a recipient with
Charles Mee Jr. of a 2001 Pew Charitable Trust/Theatre Communications
Group National Theatre Artist Residency award and a National Endowment for
the Arts/Theatre Communications Group Directing Fellowship.

Two related events will complement the performances. On September 11 at 5
pm, Carson and Galindo will speak about their collaboration in a talk
entitled Discussing Decreation. The talk will take place in the Maude Fife
Room, 315 Wheeler Hall, on the campus of the University of California,
Berkeley. For more information please call Consortium for the Arts at
(510) 642-7784 or visit www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/bca/.

On October 26 at 7 pm, Carson will appear at a reception and reading
celebrating the release of a limited-edition book of the libretto for The
Mirror of Simple Souls, another work in the Decreation series. For this
letterpress intaglio volume, Carson collaborated with Kim Anno, an
associate professor of fine arts at CCAC. Anno created prints and
monotypes for the book. The event, part of the San Francisco Center for
the Book’s Poets Pulling Prints series, will take place at the Center, 300
De Haro Street, San Francisco. For more information please call the Center
at (415) 565-0545 or visit www.sfcb.org.

6 p.m. : Reception celebrating our Archive
7:30 p.m.: Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge & Chris Tysh

Welcome to fall 2001 at Small Press Traffic! We begin tonight with a gala
evening. At 6 we host a reception celebrating our Archive’s new home at
Simpson Library, CCAC. At 7:30, a reading by luminous poets Mei-Mei
Berssenbrugge & Chris Tysh. Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge was born in Beijing  and
grew up in  Massachusetts. Her books include The Heat Bird (Burning Deck,
winner of an American Book Award), Empathy (Station Hill), and Four Year
Old Girl (Kelsey Street). Her collaborations include artists books with
Richard Tuttle and Kiki Smith, and theatre works with Frank Chin, Blondell
Cummings, Tan Dun, Shi Zhen Chen and Alvin Lucier. She has been a
contributing editor of Conjunctions magazine since 1978, and has taught at
Brown University and the Institute of American Indian Arts. Once an
associate of Georgia O'Keefe, she is active in both Native and Asian
American cultural movements, and recently read at the UN. Chris Tysh is
currently working on a film script based on the works of Bataille; her new
book is Continuity Girl. Previous works include Porne, Secrets of
Elegance, and Coat of Arms, the last of which includes prose poems
investigating the semi-ancient arts of heraldry and femininity. Lyn
Hejinian says of Coat of Arms: “The very fact that we call heraldic
symbols ‘devices’ makes them vulnerable to another realm -- the poetic --
where prerogatives can be rethought and ultimately dispersed. Tysh's
writing doesn’t say we shouldn't be somewhere, but it acts out a being
there in a different (gorgeous and unpunishing) way.”

The Jewish Museum  at 1109 5th Avenue and 92nd Street, NYC 10128 (212-423-3200)
will be featuring an exhibit from September 9, 2001,  through February 10, 2002.
(www.thejewishmuseum.org) consisting of

                     Ben Katchor: Picture-Stories
                     Doug and Mike Starn: Rampart's Cafe
                     Arnold Dreyblatt: The Re-Collection
                     Mechanism

I want to call attention to the installation of the American artist Arnold
Dreyblatt: The Re-Collection Mechanism,

Since Arnold Dreyblatt has been living in Berlin from the mid-1980’s on, his art
is very little known in this country, although as a composer and interactive
electronic installation artist, it has been seen and heard throughout most
countries of Western and Eastern Europe. Although this will be his first
installation in the U.S. performances of his New Orchestra of Excited Strings
have been heard in Boston, at MIT, and New York City in the last two years.

On October 28 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, there will be a Bang On
A Can Marathon Performance of  Dreyblatt’s New Orchestra of Excited Strings.

The works of an artist in which the sensory elements of living space are most
important are not easy to describe—even if they are also based on texts and
archival material. The main reason why poets, writers, and conceptual artists as
well, as painters and musicians would be interested in finally encountering
Dreyblatt pieces in North America, can be found in knowing about the biographical
encyclopedia Who’s Who in Central & Eastern Europe.

This book has formed a vital part of various works of Dreyblatt’s art based on
the forces of memory, recollection, and recording of photographs and texts of
20th century European social experience.

Dreyblatt discovered the Who’s Who book in a Turkish bookstall in 1985. It had
originally been published in English in 1935 and later revised. He  adapted  it
to his own uses as a project in recovering and re-activating  historical and
biographical memories. These two editions were the first and last  mid-European
biographical dictionaries to be published until Who's Who in the Socialist
Countries of Europe came out in 1989. (The revised Who’s Who of 1935 is now
available in a recent German translation.)

As can be seen from its title, The Recollection Mechanism,  opening at the Jewish
Museum September 9, is part of Dreyblatt’s archival enterprise which took
different forms over the years (The Memory Projects, The Spaces of Memory, The
Reading Room). They stem from Dreyblatt’s revitalizing the 20th century anonymous
European experience of being caught up in historical tides.

Dreyblatt’s works have been seen and heard in various cities of Germany,
Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, and Luxembourg for the last fifteen years.

Consult his website at www.dreyblatt.de/ for more complete information. Or e-mail
me as above. I don’t represent The Jewish Museum—I  know Arnold Dreyblatt’s work
as a visual poet and friend.

PROSE ACTS brings together importantly fearless poets, writers, and
musicians for an incisive four-day affair in Buffalo, New York. It looks
like a conference but thinks more like a festival. It acts like a festival
but will be like a big brainstorm. Our confirmed participants include
Dennis Cooper, Eileen Myles, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Robert Gluck,
Matthew Stadler, White Collar Crime, Roberto Tejada, Ether Drag, Lawrence
Braithwaite, Swis Dot, and The National. SCOUT, a live compilation of
writers and musicians that began at Threadwaxing Space in Manhattan is
doing a ten-day event at Hallwalls in Buffalo. The first week overlaps and
joins forces with Prose Acts. Confirmed artists include The Need, Michelle
Tea, Bruce Benderson, Mary Gaitskill, Ishle Park, Magic Twelve, and many
more.

Further information is available at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu/conferences/01/proseacts/>;
watch for updates as I just built the site yesterday.

Even further information will be available later this month at
the Hallwalls site <http://www.hallwalls.org/>.

Brad, I don't say this to be snide, because I do sympathize with the general
direction that I sense in what you say. HOWEVER:

1)When "formlessness" becomes a "tool", it assumes a certain "form". So
beware of "Formless tools"!

2) Forms may be tools to smash forms into formlessness. So beware of
throwing any tools you might have bequeathed from your grandfathers into the
dumpster.

3) The Heart Sutra says, "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form." So beware
of embracing only one.

"Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a go-with-the-flow style, or
with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune.
Learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing events through your
own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that
people constantly peddle your way. It means ultimately that you must throw
out the laws that others preach, and the books that
they write to tell you what to do, and the sage advice of the elder. The
laws that govern circumstances are abolished by new
circumstances. Rely too much on other people's ideas and you end up taking a
form not of your own making. Too much
respect for other people's wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be
brutal with the past, especially your own, and have
no respect for the philosophies that are foisted on you from the outside."
