 lemon spaghetti

  You bring meaning to my life. I've been meaning to get back to you on that. It's too hot most of the time. Something every day.

  Stomach hurt stem mesmerist's remorseful loofa healing melt lemon  favourite spaghetti lake. Stomach hurt stem mesmerist's seminal leper  pearl rolling over fork roaming charged den flinch. Melt lemon  spaghetti sanguine or all coffee walking sauce polls with hoop shoal  cloaca cocoa rodent. Cokebots and the disease that loves them.

  You're my inspiration. You're the wings atop my wind. You're so  goddamned graceful with your hurt. You're hurt smug without pardon when  all they really wanted was wifi.

  Let's talk about tabbed browsing for awhile, and awareness of documents  that no-one's touching with the hands, or are the eyes a way of  touching? Are the eyes a way of touching without ruffled? When I pick  up a book or I pick up a towel or I pick up a gun or I pick up a broken  letter found lying down crying, it changes somehow, no? I can at least  change its location; I can change its course. You might want to try a  stronger grain.

  But if I just look am I changing it? Am I changing it at all? Am I changing it just for me? And who are you?

  Stomach hurling stream measurement of remorseful loaves healing melts.  Lemon famished spaghetti lake. I see the meaning in my life, now.  You're atop my mind, so fucking graceful. I slide my hands over your  breasts.

Hi Rod,

I haven't seen one of your lists in a while, so I'm glad to see
you're still doing them. & I hope you're doing well.

I've been accumulating a bunch of titles I'm looking for that I've
attached below. Could you please let me know what of these you have
and/or can get for me? Most of the bigger presses I can get through a
local store that needs the business but they aren't interested in
working directly with small presses or even with SPD.

I haven't been doing any NEA panels lately, though there is a
possibility that this may change in the next year or so. If so, I'll
give you a shout.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Bests,

Herb

Simon Pettet's "More Winnowed Fragments" just came out from Talisman House.
It is a lean and mean and powerful book, made of series of musical explosions.
I recommend it to everyone. Here are two passages from it:

My Methology

I accrue hordes

and then

winnow away,

It is a thankless task,

tho' not without

occult comfort.



The ripest of the blackberries
Both delights the child and seduces and appalls
(he is quite ignorant of course
and quite surprised by those adoring
adjacent stinging nettles


They poems hang as mysterious objects in the space of the book. I repeat my
recommendation.

Murat

In two weeks (approximately), we will be unveiling the Unlikely 2.0
South African Issue, featuring fiction, poetry, film, music, art, and
essays exclusively by and about South Africans. Read it, or something
horrible will happen. But until then, check out this mini-update:

A Sardine on Vacation, Episode Thirty-Three: The Sardine's stalker returns
I review "Matches," the new novel of the Israeli Defense Forces by Alan
Kaufman
M. Andre Vancrown reviews "The Disappearance and the Slow Awakening,"
the poet-centered novel by Tony R. Rodriguez

And to the best of my knowledge: it's Christmas Time! So get on over to
the newly refurbished Unlikely Store at
http://www.cafepress.com/unlikely2 ! Show your support for Lopez
Obrador, Ronald Reagan, or Nero! Purchase thongs with lines from George
Orwell! Drink out of mugs emblazoned with the very come-on lines that
have caused your editor's involuntary celebacy! The goods are cheap and
the writers are easy, so head over to http://www.unlikelystories.org today!

Subject: Homolinguistic Holiday Cards

Oh ho sing mystic all the day bards!

Here's the deal:

Take a favorite (or despised or cliche) holiday-connected phrase and
do a homolinguistic translation of it.

Send me the original phrase, your homolinguistic translation of that
phrase, and your snail mail address, by email, by December 1st.

I will put each translation onto the "picture" side of a postcard, and
place the original phrase as the "title" on the address side, along
with your name as author.

Then, I'll print up as many sets are there are participants and mail
complete sets to all the participants (postmarked) by December
7th--hopefully that will put them in everyone's hands in enough time
to be useful for your holiday card mailing needs.

How fun does that sound?
Dan

PS: Please feel free to circulate this invitation to any people or
lists you think might be interested. This is an open invitation, but
publication will only be to the closed set of actual participants.

Can you arrange the squares in an interesting way, Kevin?  Depending on =

Here is quite an interesting new publication from Italy, run by a poet named
Marco Mancuso. The pub is http://www.digicult.it/digimag . It covers quite a
range of digital art.

There's a feature on a net art project at http://56k-bastard.tv . I thought
the 56k-bastard.tv project was pretty invigorating. There are 'programs' by
various artists including jimpunk from Paris. Jimpunk's work, some say, is
Jodi warmed over. I can't say I agree. I confess I was never real hot on
Jodi's work. I suppose Jimpunk has been influenced to some degree by Jodi,
but I find jimpunk's work exciting whereas I just didn't have that feeling
about Jodi's. Jimpunk's work has far greater range than Jodi aspired to. And
Jimpunk also knows Javascript/DHTML quite extensively, which is what permits
the range, whereas Jodi would typically do a thing to death and then that's
the end. Jodi's gone whereas I think Jimpunk will be around for a long time.

Digicult.it also has a feature on some net art projects that use the Flickr
API to do stuff with semantics and images.

That's all I've explored of this issue of Digicult.it so far--I liked both
of these 'coverages'.

It=92s a great game =96 ask 71 writers, some from out of retirement, =
each to step up to the plate and deliver a short text on the occasion of =
Bowering=92s 70th birthday. What will they do =96 reach for some =
nostalgia out of the strike zone? =96 hit a zinger back through the box? =
=96 work the words for a base on balls? =96 swing mightily for the =
bleachers? =96 pop up right out of genre? =96 agonize over the last =
strikeout? You won=92t want to miss this one.

Profits from this limited print run will be contributed to the George =
Bowering scholarship fund. The George Bowering/Poet Laureate scholarship =
is given to a student graduating from George's old high school in =
Oliver, British Columbia. The student must have a demonstrated interest =
in writing and be a bit of a pain in the ass. The first scholarship was =
awarded in 2004.

         from =93Reflections of George (or George Bowering, That Cream =

   You can hear George everywhere. Go to a ballpark, he=92s shouting at =
the umpire; go to a pub, he announces TFP (Traditional First Piss); go =
to a party or a reading, he=92s the loudest man in the room. No kidding. =
You can=92t miss hearing him even if you=92re a whole block away, or =
you=92re driving by Nat Bailey Stadium with your windows down.
    You know what that loudmouth side of him does? It creates space =
around him so he can write his heart out. He jokes off his worst so he =
can write his best. He can hit a poem out of the park, slam a paragraph =
over the infield, and land a chapter that looks so easy that the =
centrefielder catches it with grace.
     No one can strike his writing out. There=92s a George rhythm to his =
work and play. Friends and readers sometimes have to stretch to catch a =
joke, but there=92s no doubt Bowering has balanced his life so he can =
compose books. More books than he=92s had birthdays--not bad, eh? He =
catches phrases and creates lines or sentences with glee. Deep love and =
consciousness also. =93Consciousness is how it is composed.=94  =20

dear listers,

yesterday i inadvertently sent a message to the group when i meant to sent it to a particular member. there wasn't anything private or worrisome about the message, but it cluttered the inboxes of all when it was meant for one. i had been wondering why messages to specific list members sometimes end up going to the group at large. now i see how easy it is to make that sending error. i will certainly be more careful in the future.

while i am (intentionally) writing to you all, i'll add:

lauren russell's poetry reading at zinc bar in october and deborah eisenberg's fiction reading at nyu last month were among the most wonderful i'd attended in a while. also, if anyone has an email address for marie howe, i'd welcome it (via backchannel!).

all best, pam

I've been reading the Web site ( http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin )
concerning the current exhibition on Darwin's work at the American Museum of
Natural History in New York. It's well written and engaging, if you'd like
to check it out. It outlines in an exciting, understandable way how Darwin
came to his notion of evolution. Several interesting videos, also. And there
are good resources for teachers. A good site for adults and children alike.

Last week or so, I read at
http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/11/20/wdarwin20.xml
that the exhibit "...failed to find a corporate sponsor because American
companies are anxious not to take sides in the heated debate between
scientists and fundamentalist Christians over the theory of evolution." And
that the exhibit is, instead, funded by "wealthy individuals and private
charitable donations."

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

*
1. About the Poetics List*

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF
<http://www.roofbooks.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=93780100631100>and also on
line at the EPC. <http://epc.buffalo.edu/presses/roof/>

*2. Posting to the List*

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.

*
3. Subscriptions*

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubcribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.



*4. Subscription Options*

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.



*5. To Unsubscribe*

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

*6. Cautions*

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Subject:      Lowell, Mass. arts contributor held on immigration charges
MIME-Version: 1.0

Alpha Diallo, a native of Senegal, a Rastafarian, and an important behind-the-scenes contributor to the arts resurgence in Lowell, Mass. is being held on immigration charges at the Suffolk County House of Corrections (South Bay) in Boston. Last night at a local organic cafe, Life Alive, more than 200 people turned out for a benefit and raised more than $8,000 for Alpha's defense and bid for citizenship. Alpha Diallo exemplifies "the duties and responsibilities that come with being a member of a community." Every time I've seen Alpha (2-3 times per week) over the past year he has been kind, gentle, generous and gracious. When we lacked a mic stand for a poetry reading he was there in a pinch. I had the mic stand at home for over a week and ran into Alpha several times during the next week. Alpha never mentioned the mic stand. When I realized I was remiss, and took it back to Alpha, I apologized for the delay and said I owed him a huge favor. His response was no problem, anytim
e, that I owed him no obligations. Individuals like Alpha Diallo are rare. Citizenship such as Alpah exemplifies in his involvement in the arts and culture in Lowell can hardly be found among US-born citizens. Over the next few weeks a website will be posted at http://freealpha.com. As of today the site has only the announcement for last night's fundraiser. Soon it will include many ways to support Alpha. The community of artists in Lowell, particularly the younger artists, is mobilizing to stand behind Alpha Diallo. Read more in the Lowell Sun: http://www.lowellsun.com/fastsearchresults/ci_3275087.

Please think of Alpha Diallo and send your best thoughts and wishes to him.

michael,


thanks for the above.

i checked the lowell sun link you provided and it said this:

"on the day of Diallo's arrest, Valerie Diallo, from whom he is now
estranged, convinced a Lowell District Court clerk magistrate to extend the
term of a restraining order she had against him until November 2006."

=B3The police have advised me strongly to file a restraining order because I
am afraid for my safety,=B2 Valerie Diallo wrote in an affidavit. =B3The
defendant has history of violent temper and severe emotional abuse against
me during a three-year marriage.=B2

i only know what you and this article say of alpha diallo, but if the above
from his estranged wife is true his is not a corner i could be in.

best,
david

Alpha Diallo is not charged with assault, he is being held on immigration charges. Alpha Diallo is a person known in the community for his gentle, generous and gracious spirit.

Subject:      SVA Critical Writing Program
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The School of Visual Arts Graduate Program in Art Criticism and
writing  is now accepting applications for its Fall 2006 classes.
This is a new program that began just this Fall, under the direction
of Tom McEvilley. Current faculty, in addition to McEvilley include --


SUZANNE ANKER
WILLIAM BECKLEY
SUSAN BEE
ROGER DENSON
THYRZA NICHOLS GOODEVE
THOMAS HUHN
DONALD KUSPIT
RAPHAEL RUBINSTEIN
MIRA SCHOR
DAVID LEVI STRAUSS

More information at
http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/grad/index.jsp?sid0=2&sid1=164

Here is what McEvilley writes as his statement for the program:

Recently, the function of art and the nature of art criticism have
both undergone change and expansion. Art has for the most part
abandoned its exclusively aesthetic orientation and expanded its
purview into social engagement and critique; it has also become a
means of collaborating with and assisting in various social and
cultural points of view.

Art criticism meanwhile has experienced a variety of changes and
engagements in linkage with art and on its own. If art criticism is
to deal with our ever-changing and diverse world, its understanding
of the image and how it works as a mediating device in the midst of
many cultural forces must be extended. The SVA program de-emphasizes
the tradition of artistic nationalism in favor of a broader awareness
that includes a global acknowledgment of various cultures and their
artistic practices.

The program offers a wide range of courses that are concerned with
ideas from the Western tradition to the artistic products and
theoretical positions of all the world's cultures. Attention is paid
to ancient art and its premises; to the role of art in the formation
of nation-states; its religious uses and contents; its relation to
depth psychology, and to the aesthetic and anti-aesthetic dichotomies
found in modernism and postmodernism. The practice of writing art
criticism is an essential component of this program, the approach is
broad, from the analytical to the poetic.

In addition to its multicultural orientation, the program emphasizes
the deep roots of art criticism in philosophy. Students are given a
generalized knowledge of world philosophy, approached primarily
through the image, its modes of meaning, its social functions and the
discourse it has generated.

An underlying principle of this program is that the image should
begin to occupy a place in the understanding of life comparable in
importance to that occupied by the humanities and sciences. The
primary objective is to produce art critics who possess the knowledge
and formal training to respond to art within an intellectual,
cultural and artistic context.

us.

Send a letter to Washington D.C.

Send a PLEA to your state senator.

Please REQUEST immediately:

to come back to.

3.    That our families=92 HOMES be restored so they have a sanctuary =20=

to come home to.

Wherever you are, do this TODAY.

Your letter must get to congress by Christmas Eve.

In the many voices, there is ONE voice.

That voice is YOU.

If you do not ACT now, the fate that awaits us is surely one in which =20=

we will all lose.

Please answer this CALL to action.

We desperately need your HELP.

Our HEARTS are heavy.

Our burdens have become too much for any ONE of us to bear.

Your LETTER may be the greatest gift you give all holiday season.

Transcript from the Senate Committee Hearing 11/17/05, opening =20
statement from James M. Inhofe
"Before we get too far down the road of deciding what we should do =20
when rebuilding, we first must understand happened to the levees and =20
why the city was flooded. If mistakes were made in the past, they =20
must be rectified. There are a number of experts here today that have =20=

been taking a look at this very issue, and while it is too early for =20
final conclusions, some preliminary assessments have already been =20
made. I understand that the Army Corps of Engineers has been making =20
some adjustments when restoring the current protection to take into =20
account these initial findings.
This hearing is especially important in that it will help bring into =20
focus the degree to which the preliminary findings on the failure of =20
the levees are being incorporated into the restoration of hurricane =20
protection in Louisiana. Repairs to the levee system must begin now =20
in order to prepare for the next hurricane season, which means that =20
we can't wait for the final reports to begin the rebuilding. =20
Conversely, if preliminary findings suggest areas of weakness in =20
levee design or construction, it is important to incorporate those =20
preliminary findings in near-term restoration efforts. The challenge =20
we have at hand is incorporating the lessons learned from the ongoing =20=

assessment of levee performance while simultaneously restoring the =20
levee system to pre-hurricane design standards."

!*"Tookie: From Chaos to Consciousness" by Mumia Abu-Jamal

TOOKIE: FROM CHAOS TO CONSCIOUSNESS
======================================
[Col. Writ. 11/20/05] Copyright '05 Mumia Abu-Jamal

The name Stanley 'Tookie' Williams, is both famous and infamous.

Infamous because of his multiple murder convictions in California, which
led him to Death Row; Famous because of his works while there, and the
growing movement to spare his life, and perhaps achieve his freedom from
California’s notorious San Quentin prison.

Those works include the writing of several, award-winning anti-gang and
anti-violence books, many of them written especially for young folks,
which have turned many away from the perils and pitfalls of gang life.

They respond to Tookie, because they know that he knows what he’s
talking about. Tookie is one of the founders of the Crips gang, which
has spread all across the nation. As one of the founders of Cripdom, his
words have a resonance that others, either in government or the church,
simply can’t match.

Tookie’s life example is also known to us through the acting of the
Oscar-winning Jamie Foxx, who portrayed the muscular former gangbanger
in a tele-drama called, “Redemption”. Foxx, the man and celebrity has
joined the call to California’s Governor, fellow actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, to commute his death sentences to life. Just recently,
Foxx was joined by his fellow actor, Will Smith, and rapper Snoop Dogg,
who has echoed Foxx’s call.

Several months ago, the anti-death penalty publication, *The New
Abolitionist* (published by the Chicago-based Campaign to End the Death
Penalty) published a brief letter from Tookie in which he addressed the
issues of both his innocence and his sincerity. He wrote:

"My detractors in the media and elsewhere have questioned my redemption.
Their doubt is driven largely by my open apology (....at
http://www.tookie.com) to Black folks and others who might have been
offended by the fact that I helped create the Crips youth gang in Los
Angeles 34 years ago. My detractors argue that I could not be redeemed
because I have not apologized to the family members of the victims that
I was convicted of killing.

"But please allow me to clarify. I will never apologize for capital
crimes that I did not commit -- not even to save my life. And I did not
commit the crimes for which I was sentenced to be executed by the State
of California.

"Being a condemned prisoner, I am viewed among the least able to qualify
as a promoter of redemption and of peace. But the most wretched among
society can be redeemed, find peace and reach out to others to lift them
up. Redemption cannot be faked or intellectualized. It must be
subjective, experienced, and shared. In the past redemption was an alien
concept to me. But from 1988 to 1994, while I lived in solitary
confinement, I embarked on a transitional path toward redemption. I
underwent years of education, soul-searching, edification, spiritual
cultivation, and fighting to transcend my inner demons.

"Subsequently, the redeeming process for me symbolized the end of a bad
beginning--and a new start.”
[From: *The New Abolitionist*, Aug. '05, p. 2]

Stanley 'Tookie' Williams has been nominated several times for the
prestigious Nobel Peace Prize, for his work in support of street peace,
and in anti-gang efforts. He has written nine anti-gang and
anti-violence books, and created the Internet Project for Street Peace,
which connects youth globally in support of that end.

That said, Tookie has a date with death: December 13, 2005!

What makes Tookie’s case doubly disturbing is that the State played fast
and loose with jury selection, by kicking off 3 potential Black jurors,
resulting in a virtually all-white jury to decide both his guilt and
whether he should live or die (there were 10 Caucasians; 1 Filipino and
1 Latino).

Is racial jury-rigging a 'minor' thing?

Just recently, in Philadelphia, a man who had been on Death Row for over
a decade, for multiple murders, had his retrial. His original conviction
was tossed because of a violation of the *Batson* rule (which forbids
the removal of Black jurors). A racially mixed jury acquitted him of
*all* charges.

It can be said that Tookie didn’t receive a fair trial, by any standard.
How can he then face death?

The death penalty has been losing steam for years, largely because of
cases which were 'won' by unfairness.

With the support of the people, that may be ending, as the fight for the
life of Tookie begins!

Canadian Press: Alleged Black Panther to be extradited

by Colin Perkel
Friday, November 25, 2005

TORONTO -- A man accused of being a militant Black Panther who shot and
paralyzed a Chicago police officer more than 35 years ago was ordered
extradited on Friday but won't be facing American justice anytime soon.

An Ontario judge ruled that Joseph Pannell, a married father of four who has
lived in the Toronto area for more than two decades, must return to the
United States to face charges of attempted murder for the 1969 shooting
of police
officer Terrence Knox.

After the ruling, Pannell's wife and four children stood in protest outside
the U.S. Consulate located across the street from the downtown courthouse.

"We all have bleeding hearts right now, but this is not over," said
Pannell's wife, Natercia Coelho.

"He came here because he feared for his life. What happened to him was wrong
in '69, and what happened today is wrong."

Pannell, a former Toronto library worker, spent more than two decades living
quietly in the west-end suburb of Mississauga under the name Gary Freeman.

He was arrested in July 2004 after the U.S. Department of Justice and the
FBI asked Canadian authorities to search for matches to his fingerprints.

Ontario Superior Court Justice David Watt ruled that Pannell's case met the
test for extradition because there was sufficient evidence to have committed
him to trial had Pannell faced the charges in Canada.

However, it is federal Justice Minister Irwin Cotler who must now decide,
based on all the facts of the case, whether to turn him over to the
Americans.

"Fight this surrender to the end," lawyer Julian Falconer said Pannell told
his defence team.

Pannell's lawyers now plan to make submissions to the minister, and it will
likely be at least six months before a decision, which can also be
challenged in the Ontario Court of Appeal, is rendered.

Pannell also said he plans to take Watt's ruling to the appeals court based
on the judge's decision to disallow cross-examination of the U.S. prosecutor
who provided a summary of the evidence against him.

"The ruling speaks to the inherent frailties in the system we have for
extradition," Falconer said.

"The question is why a Canadian court is left in the position where our own
system gives us almost no right or opportunity to assess the reliability of
the information by which we're extraditing him."

Pannell, who was 19 at the time of the shooting, has never denied shooting
Knox, who was then 21, but said it happened in self-defence after the police
officer attacked him.

"African-American males in the city of Chicago were under siege by police,"
Falconer said of the political conditions at the time.

Pannell's lawyers argue there are major inconsistencies in Knox's version of
what happened March 7, 1969. They also say much of the evidence has long
been destroyed, and Pannell could not get a fair trial in the U.S.

*Man who allegedly shot U.S. cop to be extradited *

CTV.ca News Staff

A Toronto judge ruled Friday that a man should be extradited to the U.S.
to face attempted murder charges for a 35-year-old shooting.

Reputed former Black Panther Joseph Pannell is alleged to have shot and
paralyzed Chicago police officer Terrance Knox.

He's been wanted in the U.S. since skipping bail on two occasions, the
first time in 1971 and the second in 1973, when he fled to Canada.

Pannell, who went by the name Gary Freeman, had worked as a researcher
with the Toronto Public Library for 13 years and had lived in
Mississauga, for more than two decades.

After the ruling, his wife and four children held a protest outside the
U.S. Consultate, directly across from the court house.

"We all have bleeding hearts right now, but this is not over," said
Pannell's wife Natercia Coelho.

"He came here because he feared for his life. What happened to him was
wrong in '69, and what happened today is wrong.

"One thing that you learn, we will not surrender."

Pannell's wife and four children had hoped the court would not allow the
extradition.

They plan to file an appeal of the court decision.

When the shooting occurred in 1969, Knox was patrolling high school
grounds in the Kensington District of Chicago. The officer stopped a
19-year-old on the street to ask him why he wasn't in school.

Pannell allegedly pulled out a 9 mm handgun and fired 13 times. Three
shots struck Knox, severing an artery in his arm and leaving him
partially paralyzed.

In the summer of 2004 American authorities started to catch-up with the
suspected former Black Panther.

Investigators sent Pannell's fingerprints to Canada. After a check,
authorities north of the border found a match. It came from a 1983
customs violation where Pannell failed to declare a camera he bought
during a trip to the U.S.

It has not been proven that Pannell was a member of the militant black
rights group.

As of now, there are no *formal* plans to put any part of the Delany symposium
on-line.  However, if -- once this semester ends and the conference planners
have time to consider the next phases of preparation -- we find the technical and
human resources (as well as sufficient interest) to bring e-media into the
conference, we may do so.  But no plans just yet.  Check the conference website
(www.english.buffalo.edu/delany) for updates, and address inquiries to
delanyconference@gmail.com.

Call for Participation:  2 Factory School Textbooks

**Please Forward Where Appropriate**

Factory School is currently editing 2 textbooks for immediate production
and use by students. We are also looking for other textbook ideas, are
searching for potential editors and curators, and as part of that are
assembling a wiki to coordinate the communal writing, editing and critique
of the assembled materials.  We have enough people to do this, but are
hoping for others to come on board to accomplish the following:

1. expedited editing of materials for instructional purposes
2. textbooks must be sold at cost or nearly so to counter-act the
corporate textbook scam
3. organizational modeling for future project work

Here are the two textbooks currently in process:

1. "Introduction to Literature"--assembled from the public domain, orphan
texts, and more contemporary writers who've donated their works to the
project. The goal is to write assemble a 10,000 page "open-source"
textbook to be modified for local use. We need editors, contributors, as
well as more and more advisors to allow us to muscle-past textbook
committees who might see our project as threatening if not bizarre. "Is
that a real textbook or did you make it yourself?"

2. "Pirates of the University: Campus Psychogeography and Free Culture
Reader"--this book is what it sounds like, and is hopefully the project
that folks on this list will be most prepared to help with developing.
Since most of the writings involved are scattered, we're looking for
suggestions on both of these topics, psychogeography and free culture,
though it's not like we're ignorant of these topics. We're just looking
for good examples of psychogeographical writings that we might not know
of, as well as good theoretical writings on them. Again, please forward
any suggestions you may have. If we get duplicates, even better. This
project is open should anyone like to get involved, and we're looking for
referrals, especially to the writers involved, with whom we'd like to
establish contact as soon as possible.

There are other projects on the horizon, and we are currently seeking
proposals, and more information can be given: please write to me at
kuszai at factoryschool.org  or ossuary at factoryschool.org

Thanks for your time--

Hey, WOW----seriously! I'm actually LEARNING something on the poetics
list---which makes me feel "out of it" and "ignorant" and that's not a bad
thing, because in this case I think it can be SOLVED....


I never heard the word WIKI before----please illuminate!
Thanks in advance, and more later

I haven't even read beyond that word yet---I can kind of get it from context
I think---but am still really curious of that etymology--
(please forgive me for asking you rather than googling--
google the new dictionary/enclypodeia....etc etc...)

I think I could see myself in a WIKI

first novel fellowship and a Starcherone Fiction Prize. Robert Clark Young
wrote (The Brooklyn Rail, September 2005), "Reading [it] is like wandering
into the nexus between modernism and postmodernism, with new- millennium
versions of the poetry riffs, prose poems, and stream-of-consciousness
flights that are found in Ulysses or "The Waste Land." Block's work has been
exposed or is forthcoming in/on TDR, Black Ice, Alt-X, Chain, Eclectic
Seizure Radio, San Francisco Bay Guardian, ONTHEBUS, Drunken Boat, Documents
Between, Camerawork, Chimera Review, The Detroit Free Press, Anthology Film
Archives, San Francisco Cinematheque, Museum of Contemporary Art/Denver,
Exploratorium Museum, Santa Fe Art Institute, etc. Block has received
writing grants and fellowships from Djerassi Resident Artists Program, Mill
Foundation, Sigma Xi Society for Scientific Research, University of
Michigan, University of California, Santa Cruz, and Intersection for the
Arts.

chris,

there is a great article in the new york times recently about why you
can't trust wikipedia, because anyone can write any ole thing and
call it an "encyclopedia" entry.   i feel bad about exposing my
students to the wikipedia/wiki thing, since now they'll have to make
their own.

as fredy perlman wrote, "if you don't like it, make your own" -- so
be it.

the etymology?  hmmm..   any takers out there?  i've decided to
resist googling or offering links in response, and will suggest that
it's a home, made of thatch and detroit or chicago or pittsburgh
cement, glued by will...

hope that helps--  write me direct, but i'd have to unmask to see
where you are...

cheers,

j

actually WIKIPEDIA is the new encyclopedia... and a WIKI...

also, there have been several wiki that people have started and tried to
get active

Chris, your best starting point is probably
http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki . From there, you'll find the
originators other comments on the Wiki concept.

Praise for The December Project

Time stopped in December when I read this fine book of postcard poems.
Written from short bright days and long cold nights, filled with Sean Cole=B9=
s
signature humor, these deeply felt and completely original poems address
those of us who also consider December a project. The poems move from the
mundane to the serious, from love to war to simple pop songs, all in a voic=
e
that captured me at once and wouldn=B9t let go.
=8BWyn Cooper, author of Postcards from the Interior.

Read this book in the middle of the night. Pure clear words as real as any
novel. Read this book in the middle of the day, by sunlight or in rain. Sen=
d
the words to everyone. Everyone needs these words. Who would have thought
that poetry could open so gently into the world? Who would have thought the
brilliant, tender cadences of Sean Cole=B9s Itty City would slow into this
cold radiant narrative of awareness? Still brilliant, still tender; slower
now, and even deeper.
=8BJoseph Lease, author of Broken World, forthcoming on Coffee House Press

We Eat Mud
by Peter Markus

One night us brothers, we got home from fishing fish out of the dirty
river that runs its way through our dirty river town only to find our
father there in the kitchen, our father standing where our mother so
often always stood, in front of the stove, with his back looking back
at us brothers, and his face facing away from us, and what it was he
was doing, standing there like this, in front of the stove, was he
was fixing us all up some supper: mud cakes is what he said he was
almost done up cooking, when we asked what it was he was cooking up.
And a mud pie, too, he said, and he opened up the oven's door, and
when he did a muff of muddy smoke came coughing up and out.

Out is all that our father said to us when we asked him where was our
mother. Us brothers, we both of us, inside our heads, what we were
wondering was out where?-though neither one of us wondered this out
loud. Sit, sons, is what our father said to us next. Us, our father's
sons, we did like our father told. We sat ourselves down, in the
middle of the kitchen's floor, right where we were standing, us
brothers, we plopped our boy bodies down, down on our hands and
knees, and like this we waited for whatever our father was going to
say or do to us brothers next. When our father turned back his face
so to face his face at us boys, the look on his face told us that he
was happy to see us, down like this, down on our hands and knees, us
brothers-our father's sons-a couple of dirt loving dogs who liked to
get down and get dirty. It's hot is what our father said to us then,
and he held out in his hands a pie that was made out of mud. Blow,
our father told us. And we, us brothers, blew. The steam rising up
and off of this baked to a crispy crusted mud, it curled up and
around our boy faces-this steam became a pair of hands holding us in
this place. This, this is where we belong is what these hands
whispered to us. And it was like this, with us brothers down on our
hands and knees, and with our mouths wide open, and with our father
standing over us, watching over us brothers, with his boots skinned
thick with mud: like this, we began to eat

  Friends,

With N'awlins still so thinly populated, our little Mom and Pop stores are
hurting.  The link below talks about this a bit and links to a list of stores
with online catalogues.  If you still have some Xmas shopping to do, please
support small business down here.

"Jackson Mac Low's art returns us to something like the stance of an
earlier avant-garde (Russian Futurism, Dada, etc.) for which artistic,
spiritual & political renewals were all part of a single impulse. In no
contemporary does it show through as clearly, movingly, this vision of
experimental/language-centered art as social action . Mac Low, who is
one of our true inventors, creates new modes & brings us back to the
oldest possibilities of sound & language as they enter poetry & music &
performance . The more one treats the book not only as a text but as a
source & manual - the more one realizes the service of this work, its
lasting power. It is in this sense that the book becomes, in Ezra
Pound's words, 'a ball of light in one's hands.'" - Jerome Rothenberg

Wiki seems to be all the rage.

Wiki wants more writers, and is not organized like a diary, like the
blog. I've not been fond of the blog's tendency to group information
chronologically, one of those structural arbitraries that seems to
have influenced a generation--and they thought they were just being
"new york school" -- haha.

Wiki is vertical to the blog's horizontal. "Anyone can edit" destroys
the rank permissions of the solo actor theory, not to mention comment
spam.

The pedagogical possibilities are obvious: a friend in Arizona has
his students adding entries to Wikipedia, spelling out the meaning of
"border trash" -- Imagine a bunch of ASU students crashing Silliman's
blog to make a "contribution" -- I don't think so.

Here Ken and I dream big about what we can use them for in the
classroom, even as we make use of them for our FS textbook
meanderings. Out of the classroom, a group of student activists are
editing a book to be published by FS, and will use a wiki to
centralize the content organization. We're doing the same thing: for
both those students and our own work in assembling textbooks, the
wiki offers a kind of editorial transparency. When I would use the
blog to edit some text I wanted to present, each "save" destroyed
previous versions. Some how the wiki saves old drafts so it has a
build in version-compare feature that has changed my life forever.
Not only that, but the sort of burrowing feature of linkwriting, and
the main thing that I've come to appreciate: it's demand for what
they call "disambiguation" at Wikipedia; that is, a constant drive to
refine and specify meanings....resulting in the possibility of an
endless verbal factor analysis. Using the blog to write or organize
articles, etc., I realize what I really was enjoying was the web
interface to cascading style sheets and the bizarre typographer's
dream of a bookish-looking webpage. Wiki's php and css based, too, so
essentially it's the trickster's blog in the funhouse mirror.

And the blog was great--Movable Type before they went corporate; I've
not had a lot of fun customizing WordPress and gave up when I
realized that it required multiple database entries in MySql, etc.,
which was unforgiving if you wanted a lot of blogs on your site. The
wiki is the burrowers magical dream of a public writing space; a
warren of privately negotiable corners, conducted in public space.

Sorry if my response to Chris initiated the round of stupid jokes.  I
promise, as Blaser suggested, to "watch my language."

I'm happy to continue talking about this here or elsewhere if there
is interest. The Factory School wiki is currently not a public link
from the site, so if anyone wants to see it, etc., please write to me
or Bill Marsh privately...

Dear All,

Please join us tomorrow night in celebrating the recent publication of The
Collected Poems and The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Koch.

Wednesday, December 7, 8:00 pm, FREE!
Celebration of The Collected Poems and The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Koc=
h

A book party for and readings from two new and substantial collections from
Kenneth Koch, who passed away in 2002: The Collected Poems of Kenneth Koch
(Knopf) and The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Koch (Coffee House). Collected
Fiction includes Koch's rambunctious novel The Red Robins, as well as his
semi-autobiographical stories from Hotel Lambosa and much uncollected short
fiction. Collected Poems, meanwhile, contains ten books=B9 worth of Koch=B9s
dazzling poetry celebrating the pleasures of friendship, art, and love.
Readers will include Ron Padgett, Charles North, Paul Violi, Mark Halliday,
David Shapiro, Jordan Davis, Karen Koch, Katherine Koch, Philip Lopate, Ton=
y
Towle, Anne Waldman and Mark Statman.

Both collections will be offered for sale at a substantially discounted
price: The Collected Poems (hardcover) will be sold for $25 (originally
$40); The Collected Fiction (soft cover) will be sold for $12 (originally
$18).

The reading will be held in the Sanctuary, to be followed by a reception in
the Parish Hall.


To =B3Yes=B2


You are always the member of a team,
Accompanied by a question=AD
If this is the way the world ends, is it really going to?
No. Are you a Buddhist? Maybe. A monsoon? Yes.
I have been delighted by you even in the basement
When asking if I could have some coal lumps and the answer was yes.
Yes to the finality of the brightness
And to the enduring qualities of the lark
She sings at heaven=B9s gate. But is it unbolted? Bolted? Yes.
Which, though, is which? To which the answer cannot be yes
So reverse question. Pamela bending before the grate
Turns round rapidly to say Yes! I will meet you in Boston
At five after nine, if my Irishness is still working
And the global hamadryads, wood nymphs of my =B3yes.=B2
But what, Pamela, what does that mean? Am I a yes
To be posed in the face of a negative alternative?
Or has the sky taken away from me its ultimate guess
About how probably everything is going to be eventually terrible
Which is something we knew all along, being modified by a yes
When what we want is obvious but has a brilliantly shining trail
Of stars. Or are those asterisks? Yes. What is at the bottom
Of the most overt question? Do we die? Yes. Does that
Always come later than now? Yes.
I love your development
From the answer to a simple query to a state of peace
That has the world by the throat. Am I lying? Yes.
Are you smiling? Yes. I=B9ll follow you, yes? No reply.


Kenneth Koch




It would be lovely to see you there.

Love,

In response to the chit-chat on Wikis on this list; the original Wiki is at
c2.com <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors>. Founded in 1995 by Ward
Cunningham, it is mostly devoted to a certain style of software development=
.
However, I found that "Ward's Wiki" also has a lot of good material on Wiki
theory and practice, including a "one minute
Wiki<http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OneMinuteWiki>"
page. You can also find a list of available Wiki "engines" or programs.
There are dozens and it turns out that its ridiculously easy to set one up,
if you have access to a Unix server.

The site is dense and a little technical but I think that anyone interested
in Wikis could benefit from spending an hour or two at Ward's Wiki.

Yes, Chris - I agree. Tho I go to links all the time, and ask people to link
to my blog - the experience is a little bit like going into bar and told
it's after hours but you can still get a drink in the 'clubroom'.

Leaving the big room - the open public space(as this site was actively so
once) - creates the feeling that something is dead and wrong, a death of a
certain kind of democracy.

But somehow, as with the problems currently facing Wikipedia's public sense
of space, sadly certain folks seem bent on throwing screws in the works. Not
to rehash old hash it's hard to hash much out here anymore. At least blogs
can be moderated to slip pass the spammers and the thugs. Usually.

That said, Wikipedia, is quite amazing.

Wikiwiki in Hawaiian means quick or fast.

Accuracy. It's a Satanic plot. From now on, when giving factual answers
to questions, let us not refer to experts, but use poetic license.

Jonathan---

You may be right, but my point was not to single out your email
nor to come out against "accuracy" and "factual answers"

It was seeing the offhanded easy way Joel had with that word WIKI
(in this sentence)--

as part of that are
> assembling a wiki to coordinate the communal writing, editing and critique
> of the assembled materials.


And---not even knowing it was a computer-related term. But even if I did
know that it was a computer-related term, I still wouldn't know how
specifically this particular Wiki would coordinate communal writing, etc.

So I guess I was conflating two of my ignorances,
like if someone didn't know the term "JAZZ COMBO"
and read the sentence, "we are assembling a JAZZ COMBO to coordinate
the communal composing, playing and recording of the assembled materials"
one might still be rather confused even if one looked up the word
JAZZ COMBO or listened to all the Bix or Louis or Bird or Pres, etc.

The question still remains for me---how can a wiki assemble the communal
writing, and more specifically how would Joel's or anybody else who might
want to do something involving a wiki. Sure, to use my analogy, the "Jazz
combo" is a template (or platnic essence?) that would be worth talking about
and I suppose our link does a good job of that---
but would it really have been so hard for people to apply their own ideas
of this concept to be put into practice in the hear and now

Like there might be a significant difference
between
1) "What does a JAZZ COMBO (or WIKI) do?
and
2) "What does YOUR Jazz combo (or wiki) do?"

In answering the second, someone might then say---"well, it's not really a
JAZZ combo because there's a harpsichord rather than a saxophone" or
"because the music you play sounds more like what I call country&western
than jazz"

And this could be an interesting conversation, and not mere "poetic license"
but actually rather informative and even factual.

Thank you for your time....


Chris

Chris-- thanks, I appreciate what you are saying, even if I find that
you "prefer not" to fill in some basics yourself by clicking on some
links is a little odd, no eccentric.  Goodness! You could make this a
lot easier, my friend!  I'm new to these things too, am not an
advocate nor a futurist... I see it as a very simple and practical
tool for doing something that might be done. My comment about wiki
building was offhanded, and I'm sorry if it was too opaque, etc.--

It would be interesting to read a history of the desire for communal
writing machines. I think of some of the performative ones that were
in use in Albany, and places like UT Austin, with people like John
Slatin, others,  but of course I know it predates that to be sure...
and being scared about provoking another attack of the auto-renga,
I'll just line up behind the auto-thieves, who may see value in a
particular model car, but are not necessarily interested in
"promoting" it...

That said, here is an example, about what is so great about the wiki:

When you add a double bracket around something, it automatically
becomes a link.  There is nothing at that link (no page) until
someone visits it and starts typing. When saved, it becomes a page.
So, if I type, [[Chris Stroffolino]] in a wiki page, then save it,
then click on it, then type your bio, etc., then save it, suddenly
there is a page saved called "Chris_Stroffolino"  and so forth. There
are other ways to link, etc., especially to pages outside a wiki
(note that that Chris_Stroffolino page would be "inside" the wiki,
that is, saved in the database files on the server). Or something
like that. I'm not really all that interested in that part, but just
trying to make use of it, understand enough to do what I want to do...

Other features: each page has a "discussion" or "talk" page, which
allows commentary about a page to live with, or behind, or next to, a
"visible" page-- If you would visit Wikipedia and check out the
"talk" -- you'll find the enormously significant ways in which
discussion accompanies editing and writing of pages. Look at a
controversial topic (Scooter Libby-related debates about balance and
objectivity, for example, were fascinating, though I've not looked
since for some time now) and you'll see what I mean...

Compare the way that "Wikipedia" organizes content and the way that
the "Urban Dictionary" does, epecially for words with multiple-user
entries (while nephz has one jaun has many and many spellings) -- the
difference between these two -- with Wikipedia working with
disambiguation, the U.D. organizes them, by compiling the
differences, not rectifying their meanings.  While both have value,
the structural possibilities offered by wiki are preferable for me in
what I'm trying to do, what I want to use it for...

What else? It's easy to keep track and see what changes have been
made; you can have a page contact you by email when it's updated
(tracking), etc. and of course it's easy to lock-down pages as
they're now doing at Wikipedia; a disappointing result.  (They're
also now talking about printing books, so I wonder how they plan to
do that in terms of the community of labor that went into developing
those pages)

And there is more, but this is starting to sound like an infomercial
for wiki culture. Dan Weinstein, Ken Sherwood and I will be
presenting a panel at Louisville XX Century Lit Conference, and this
is going to come up as Dan is the person who introduced me to wikis.
Ken will be talking about audio and podcasting, and I'll be
presenting my work on this kind of thing, though refracted through
subcultural theory and council communism and a proposal for the
systematic hausmanization of the poetics list...

Frankly, I'm shocked that given our ability to communicate, we aren't
more "organized" than we might be. Our channels are fragmented, our
interests atomized. I'm publishing my books but for WHAT? Perhaps I'm
just swooning having seen Julie Herrada's awesome exhibit at UofM on
the 100th anniversary of the IWW and thinking now about all the stuff
we need to do to think through what the '56 Hungarian uprising might
mean for us 50 years later. I'm embarrassed to have gotten less done,
to have been more involved in what other people are doing, looking
around and seeing all the rhetorical flourish but very little of
substance in the way of material something. Look around, what
institutions have we built? And not to be "pro-institution" But...
And if we were going to build an institution, one that might threaten
the viability of at least one wasteful, bullshit-producing
corporation, why wouldn't we?

Sorry to go on so long-- I now have to run to a day of student
conferencing, but I'm happy to continue this somewhere, so keep in
touch--

In the wake of Alan posting his text from his live writing
performance on Thursday here I wanted to acknowledge the generosity
of his presence and presentations here in Oxford this past week. He
was very much available to both faculty and students, he gave three
presentations (one off-campus, one to a class and one to a theatre
audience). In addition his visit coincided with the launch of a new
student magazine here Megaphone Piggy, a standing-room only reading
of some seriously interesting new work at which his presence was very
much appreciated, and he produced a broadside for campus-wide
circulation as part of the recently inaugurated and now already in
its fifth issue Putitupor broadside publication series.

All power to Alan for being open about his work(s), his procedures,
his key concerns. The timing was great, coming as it it did in the
wake of a similar visit by Katherine Hayles and amidst a flourishing
of  promising writing and new media interest not just in the English
Department but more generally abroad in the interdisciplinary
discussions to which writing is now so critically central.

Those wishing to get a further sense of events and developments at
Miami will be glad to know that his visit will be further evidenced
on the Meshworks site in weeks to come.

I remember his openness and enthusiasm at the last Incubation in =

and I too associate the word generosity with the work of Alan Sondheim =
and the human being

I wouldnt mind living round the corner from him in some ways so I could =
keep popping by and see what he was up to - for a cyberman he's one hell =
of a presence

I'd like to remind people that WRITERS FORUM  publishes SOPHIA and =
ORDERS OF THE REAL

WF isn't exactly geared up to supplying North America, which is a bit of =
a problem for a press which publishes north americans. As soon the fault =
in its reality is fixed, it'll attend to that. But people over there in =
the homeland do get wf publications. We're doing mIEKEL aND soon

Those who are interested in either Sondheim - and another is envisaged - =
might care to b/c and maybe we can work something out

There will be a shipment of copies to Alan in NY - following a =
forthcoming reprint - and maybe if there are potential orders in Miami =
(OH) - isnt Miami Oh! a song by Ira Gershwin? - maybe we can work out =
something that way. We can speak to the man about it.

Camille,

You don't know me--nor I, you--but we're hiring at the MLA and if it comes down to it there may be a couch or extra bed in the room I have at the Marriott Wardman Park...Alternatively I have a friend here in Cincinnati who is a good friend of Tom Orange in D.C. I could ask him to ask Tom...

I must say, I don't give out the wicker link lightly, and to have it
snubbed, well....

Last night I thought, wouldn't the old, combative POETICS list have made =
a
good poetics wiki, and what if we made a POETICS wiki? But one with =
strong
moderation or editing would be required. =20

Rather than a list, it would be more of a topical multi-threaded =
discussion,
and when the discussion was getting very heated on "lutheran surrealism" =
or
whatever, uninterested parties could go over to the "syntax" area.  But,
humorously, when discussion was getting very heated on a topic, that
particular page would be continually edited and re-edited until it =
didn't
exist. =20

So, here is my explanation:

A listserv is a software application where e-mails sent to a single =
address
are 1) sent to e-mail addresses on a list, 2) archived on a server, 3)
sorted and searchable in that archive (generally by date, author, and
topic).  In topic threads, users may elect to quote previous posts for
context.

A discussion database is one where an e-mail is sent in or a web page is
made in the database, and then people can e-mail in or compose in place =
web
pages which are "replies" or "children" of the original posting or page
"parent".  These are generally sortable more flexibly, and topics can
branch, and be expanded and collapsed, so you can see parts of a =
"discussion
thread" or not.  Users may elect to link to related pages; certain users =
may
be allowed to edit the work of others.  Users can elect to be notified =
when
something is contributed on one topic and not another.  A blog with lots =
of
comment activity is generally like an inflexible discussion database =
with a
"strong administrator".

A blog is originally organized like a journal, according to date, =
although
you can get clever on it and have it look like a book with a table of
contents, but I'll spare you -- you can write software around all this
software that will make it act like other software just like you can =
have a
string quartet and then hire a horn section but never really get an
orchestra out of it.  A multiblog where all the people participating =
have
editing privileges is sort of like a blog being used as a wiki, with
shortcomings, as Joel mentioned, like the archiving / version control
problem.

A wiki is a database where a web page is made in the database, and =
anyone
registered can make a page or edit another page.  Links to related =
pages, or
pages that will eventually exist and be related ("stumps") are =
especially
valuable in a wiki.  The problem of the imaginary ye olde POETICS liste =
is
one that remains:  some will edit the work of others rather than adding =
to
the general wiki or merely offering a competing view or opinion. =20

One problem of the old poetics list a wiki solves, though, is bandwidth,
capacity, and attention -- in that one may visit other areas when a =
single
topic is getting bogged down in minutiae.  And, perhaps, in the utopian
vision of a wiki, that certain topics will be reduced to ashes is a fine
thing, because the archive is always there.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Hello Everyone,

I've donated the very first two "New Life" comics, drawn in 1997, to Rain
Taxi for their eBay auction. The starting bid is a mere $10 for each.

Go to:

Thanks Joel (and Jerrold and Catherine and others) for explaining this--

It's still confusing to me, but it just takes a while for these things to
sink in (learn by doing, etc). So, thank you for your continued patience
with me on this---

In other news, I can't even make mix-tapes for friends anymore coz everybody
does the CD-burn thing. I know I shouldn't waste energy complaining about
all this stuff, but sometimes I wonder if it's not accidental that
1) the rise of "attention deficit syndrome" parallels the rise of various
   new technologies in the 90s and 00s
2) a kind of cultural malaise in terms of creativity that many people feel
   in many of the arts (and entertainment 'fields') doesn't somehow relate
to the acceleration of having to learn new tricks technologically just to
not "fall behind" and be "invited to the table"

   the computer people take more than just money off of us...?

    Just wonderin'

In the blog -- and i've seen this in Wordpress most dynamically --
there's a "categories" function that goes a long way to level or
flatten the chronological (horizontal) aspect of the blog. Maybe this
is one of the tricks Catherine's referring to for bypassing the basic
diary mode. Still, posts within categories are by default time-stamped,
so there's always some kind of chronological layering or stacking going
on with blogs even if you neutralize the time stamp feature. The same
is true for wiki-editing, but what I find most compelling about the
wiki (if not opposed to blogging, which to me is limited more because
of space/body partitions than chronological arbitraries) is the
multiple ways it can be used: as editing space, talk space, web site,
classroom, database storage, archive, news forum -- and these in
continuous states or stages of change/adaptation. So, a kind of
version-layering or stacking, as Joel points out, toward "finishing
facts" if not dead letters -- which lends well to group editing and
planning as per what we're now trying to do through FS.

chris,

i think boring school curricula is a better explanation for attention
deficit

but seriously, i'm wondering where you see or experience this "cultural
malaise" -- the bad thing about 'new technology' i think is definitely
"having to learn" it but i see this as more of a problem for
underfunded schools having to meet NCLB standards than for artist and
entertainment types looking for new stimuli.

but in writing, publishing, for example, the museum is filled with
bundles of high-tech tricks (techniques and practices and such) that
writers, editors, publishers have had to learn in order to make it work
the way we see it regularly w/o benefit of anything new to the 90s and
00s. a lot of that work has gone backstage to be sure, but it takes
time/money/ resources all the same. what did it take, for example, to
get invited to this poetics table and pick up a fork?

i'd love to have some of those mix-tapes, by the way. i'm giving my
kids my old 4-track recorder so they can see what it looks like for
sound to go somewhere.

cheers,
bill

InSite_05 brochure =3D game =3D terrorism (Part 2)

dear inSiters:
hopefully this letter would have been just to say hi to you and send best
wishes, unfortunately there are as well other reasons i am writing this for=
:

in a luggage check at the denver international airport, the usa/ immigratio=
n
found both a 'tijuana calling' brochure and a copy of the game that
anne-marie and me produced for inSite. they searched the insite website and
all of its
links and loaded the game and made me play it for them,  they found that th=
e
game as most of the projects were posing a threat to the us national
security
and that they were 'antiamerican', in speaking about illegal crossings and
trafffic, in their own words. one officer even told me to watch out who we
were
working for. i explained that the game as well as the other pieces of art
had been commissioned by an art institution whose objective is to gain
deeper
cross understanding about life in the mex- us border, for both the peoples
of
mexico and the us, they said they didn't believed it and discredited the
festival,
evidently ignoring what art is. when i told them that the organisation was
run by us citizens, they  replied that not all us citizens are prone to lik=
e
the
government and its policies and that actually a lot of them were working
against it.

the incident costed me a deportation, a night in a detention center,  5
years of denied entry to the us (where my wife lives and works) and
interestingly a
talk to an FBI agent, part of which i have written down:

after identifying himself as an fbi agent, an asian man (no accent) in a
semi
expensive suit with two mont blanc pens sticking out of his shirt asked me
this:

q-do you know what a terrorist is?
a-yes

q-did you made a game about a secret tunnel in the mexico- us border?

a-yes

q-do you know of any terrorist activities in the border?
a-no

q-do you know how transborder tunnels work?, have you been at one?,  or how
else did you conceived that game?

a-from divulgative information found on newspapers, the game is a piece of
art.

q-are you sure you dont know of any tunnels? how come they appear at you
game? do your game portrays any specifical location of a tunnel?

a-i am sure i have never been in such tunnels, the location was chosen by
chance

q-art is for sharing significant things with other people, why do you put
the border and the people of the us at large in risk?

a-i am not putting anyone in risk, again, the information the game is based
on comes from public sources

q-did anne-marie schleiner worked with you in the game?

a-yes

q-can you write both, yourself and anne-marie's addresses in mexico city/
boulder with phone numbers?

a-yes (i do write the information)

q-have you been contacted by any terrorists that want to use your  game for
training?

a- no

q-are you sure about this? no suspicious mail been received lately?
a-no

q-if you are contacted by anyone trying to use your game as a terrorist
weapon, lets say 'ahmed ahmud', or some mohammed or something like that,
will you
contact the mexico city office of the fbi?

a-yes, you can give me your card and i will contact you

fbi- that won't be necessary, just call the local branch since i am a
denver-assigned officer.

Can you help us with any kind of legal advice, being it civil rights and/or
immigration, facing the problem that this episode has aroused.

thanks, all the best

What was great about the poetics list was that it cut through all the
poetryland crap to real conversation; we used to have real discussions-- I
met and interacted here with people with whom I to this day have deep
respect-- (Cat Daly is one of these people) but it seems of late no one
wants to have a real discussion of what is happening in the artform and
challenging established habits and also commenting on books and poets and
their work good or bad.

I don't know if this changed because Big Chaz Bernstein has neen
domesticated by PENN but I would love just once one of those donnybrooks
where Alan Sondheim goes nuts and everyone jumps-

I like Catherine's idea but I am more interested in having a dialogue about
where people are going in their work? So many experimento poets are writing
a particular kind of poem, and the form is done is such a way as to get
FENCE or JUBILAT or another pub to publish their work or to get a book deal
I am so sick of this and I would love to see a little iconoclasm!!!

- what would be cool is for people here to discuss what they are reading and
writing and have a dialogue about the process- that sounds interesting- or
another is what is happening in various locales; I mean we get plenty of New
York and SF on the list but I would like to know more about other places and
poets-

Subject: Re: Wiki

I must say, I don't give out the wicker link lightly, and to have it
snubbed, well....

Last night I thought, wouldn't the old, combative POETICS list have made a
good poetics wiki, and what if we made a POETICS wiki? But one with strong
moderation or editing would be required.

Rather than a list, it would be more of a topical multi-threaded discussion,
and when the discussion was getting very heated on "lutheran surrealism" or
whatever, uninterested parties could go over to the "syntax" area.  But,
humorously, when discussion was getting very heated on a topic, that
particular page would be continually edited and re-edited until it didn't
exist.

So, here is my explanation:

A listserv is a software application where e-mails sent to a single address
are 1) sent to e-mail addresses on a list, 2) archived on a server, 3)
sorted and searchable in that archive (generally by date, author, and
topic).  In topic threads, users may elect to quote previous posts for
context.

A discussion database is one where an e-mail is sent in or a web page is
made in the database, and then people can e-mail in or compose in place web
pages which are "replies" or "children" of the original posting or page
"parent".  These are generally sortable more flexibly, and topics can
branch, and be expanded and collapsed, so you can see parts of a "discussion
thread" or not.  Users may elect to link to related pages; certain users may
be allowed to edit the work of others.  Users can elect to be notified when
something is contributed on one topic and not another.  A blog with lots of
comment activity is generally like an inflexible discussion database with a
"strong administrator".

A blog is originally organized like a journal, according to date, although
you can get clever on it and have it look like a book with a table of
contents, but I'll spare you -- you can write software around all this
software that will make it act like other software just like you can have a
string quartet and then hire a horn section but never really get an
orchestra out of it.  A multiblog where all the people participating have
editing privileges is sort of like a blog being used as a wiki, with
shortcomings, as Joel mentioned, like the archiving / version control
problem.

A wiki is a database where a web page is made in the database, and anyone
registered can make a page or edit another page.  Links to related pages, or
pages that will eventually exist and be related ("stumps") are especially
valuable in a wiki.  The problem of the imaginary ye olde POETICS liste is
one that remains:  some will edit the work of others rather than adding to
the general wiki or merely offering a competing view or opinion.

One problem of the old poetics list a wiki solves, though, is bandwidth,
capacity, and attention -- in that one may visit other areas when a single
topic is getting bogged down in minutiae.  And, perhaps, in the utopian
vision of a wiki, that certain topics will be reduced to ashes is a fine
thing, because the archive is always there.

All best,
Catherine Daly

You're missing the point here, typically a wiki is used to generate
anonymous yet collective content about everything under the sun.
When they are used for logging discussions or arguments, very rarely
if ever are they back edited, usually someone just adds their bit to
the mix.  I've worked in wikis going on 5 years & they are, in my
mind, the perfect software for collaborative text generation.  My
problem with them is that until recently they were highly prone to
spam & hacker attacks.  I have 2 wikis right now that were hijacked &
I've lost control of them.  But mediawiki & phpwiki have now been
released with extensive admin features which allow one to run a tight
ship.

In Joel K's cases, I really believe that they are a perfect fit for
online classrooms, distance learning & teach a lot about respecting a
collective writing environment which is largely anarchist in it's raw
form, but really any level of decision-making & organization is
possible.

(sing to the tune of a Grateful Dead song)

  I'm working on a translation of German poetry into English.  It's very experimental and Languagey (Lang-wedgie) and therefore difficult to capture... but that ain't stopping me!

  The manuscript has been sitting on a desk at some press in CT for the past 6 months.  It may have fallen (accidentally, I'm sure) into the waste bin by now.  But I have a new draft of it that is much better than the last one.  Of course, I've said that about previous drafts...

  The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began.
  There was cowboy Neal at the wheel on a bus to never, never land!
Comin' around, y'all!

  cheers,

  Eric

I just got a new gig writing experimental 'poetry' editorials for my new
shool's student publication. Visual, antin kinds of things.  Trying to get one
on the Op-ed page of the NYTimes about Pinter's speech on the 10th but I fear
it will go over their heads - "Out Roving the Rovians"

Dear Friends:

Judging by our new Supreme Chief Justice Roberts remarks and questions in
the Court yesterday re the parental notification law re abortion, my sense
is that this guy is (surprise) a jockey for the very conservative - albeit
an elite silver spoon smart - right wing.

This guy Alito is even more in the mold - two of them together will provide
us with a court bent on a stone age retro template (circa 1958) for the next
25 years. Not a kind thought for us or our children or the future of this
country -  as compromised as it already is under Bush, etc.

Please go to this web site to sign a petition to compel the Senate to reject
Alito.

Please pass on to your friends.

Digital poetry refers to a wide range of approaches to poetry that all =
have
in common prominent and crucial use of computers. Digital poetry can be
available on the World Wide Web or Internet (via email lists, for =
instance),
CD ROM, as installations in art galleries, etc. A significant portion of
current publications of poetry are available either only online or via =
some
combination of online and offline publication. There are many types of
'digital poetry' such as hypertext, kinetic poetry, code poetry, and
poetries that take advantage of the programmable nature of the computer =
to
create works that are interactive, or are generative of text, or involve
sound poetry, or take advantage of things like listservs, blogs, and =
other
forms of network communication to create communities of collaborative
writing and publication (as in poetical wikis).

6	"performance poetry"
Performance Poetry is poetry that is specifically composed for or during
performance before an audience. During the 1980s, the term came into =
popular
usage to describe poetry written or composed exclusively for performance =
and
not for print distribution. Whereas poetry readings featured poets =
reading
their printed books for a live audience, some of which were recorded on
audio media, performance poets use a different style of writing poetry =
that
is less conducive to print and better suited for their oral =
presentations.
Conversely, much performance poetry does not work well when printed in
books. Performance poets are often not academically trained in writing
poetry. Their poetic allusions are to pop culture rather than to the =
great
literature of the past. Consequently, many performance poets are denied
credibility by Academics, but are able to build a greater audience for
poetry by communicating to a wider range of people.

4) What was your overall impression of the entries in your field? Please
feel free to give examples to illustrate your points.=20

a good starting point to a new and developing field of new
media/cyber/digital/web poetry.=20
although still very patchy mentioning types of digital poetry like =
'kinetic
poetry, code poetry, and poetries that take advantage of the =
programmable
nature of the computer to create works that are interactive, or are
generative of text, or involve sound poetry, or take advantage of things
like listservs,' without further links or explanations.=20
i believe the area of poetry; print, performance and digital poetry, has =
a
strong usa bias.
there is almost no mention of digital poetries in the generic poetry =
section
and this section seems to have a print based bias.
Also in the area of the philosophical use of the terms the virtual, the
real, the actual and the possible, there is nothing valuable, these =
terms
described mainly in terms of how they are used in everyday language.

eg stated that performance poetry was first coined on a flyer for
performance poet=20
Hedwig Gorski in the early eighties. but in "off the record" published =
by
penguin in 1985 in australia PiO the editor claims it was coined at the
Adelaide festival writers week of 1978 at a panel on australian poetry =
run
by david malouf. And Ruth Starke in a paper to the soundings conference =
in
1997, states the term was in use at the adelaide festival much earlier =
when
poets like ginsberg and Ferlinghetti featured in 1972 and russian
Yevtushenko visited in 1966.


5) Have you ever used Wikipedia yourself, and if so, what did you use it
for?=20
yes, i find it invaluable for literary theories and history.

6) Have you ever contributed to Wikipedia, and if so, what did you
contribute?
no

7) Having looked at the above 5-10 entries, do you think you will use
Wikipedia again, and/or recommend it to others and your students? Why?

yes i will, and i intend to contribute in areas of interest you have =
asked
me to identify here.

8) How does Wikipedia compare to other online or offline sources of
information? (if you have time, I'd love to get your assessment for the
above three questions of other encyclopedia such as Britannica
(www.britannica.com) and/or Encarta (www.encarta.com), but I realise =
there's
probably not enough time!)=20

this is starting to sound like a gallup poll product testing survey.
it is fast it is good and there are a page full of links you can follow,
even if it doesn't find exactly what you want.

=20
9) Do you have any general thoughts on how Wikipedia operates, and do =
you
think it's a good or bad thing that it has become so popular?=20

the idea of being able to contribute to history, to knowledge by your =
entry
is exciting and empowering, 'i can make a difference', so participation =
is
justifiable.
very wholesome in a warm fuzzy modernist way.

10) Have you contributed entries to other encylopedia? What is your
expertise?=20
yes.

celebrating ten years of work-stopping injuries

$5-$10 at the door depending on what you can afford.
All proceeds go to paying the printer, or, if we don't
make enough, paying for new knees after the printer's
bill collectors get through with me.

the new, fully waterproof, unexpectedly colored issue will be on sale.
Also on sale, back issues & discount subscriptions for future ones.

We encourage you to show up early to get a seat, or even to be assured
of a place to stand.
I've been told a class from the New School will be coming &, despite my
best efforts,
a few other bigshots who'll be taking up lots of space with their big
egos.

The anchor of the evening will be several speedy readings. Readers will
include many contributors to this issue, among them: Albert Flynn
DeSilver, Chris Martin, Curtis McCartney, Dustin Williamson, Edwin
Torres, James Grinwis, John Most, Lauren Ireland, Lee Ballentine, Mike
Topp, Paul Foster Johnson, Douglas Rothschild, Bronwen Tate, Todd
Colby, Tracey McTague, Noelle Kocot, Jen Robinson & others.

go to www.lungfull.org for more including the complete lineup of
contributors.  Oh, also, there are many new photos there you may not
have seen yet, perhaps of you.

As you know, Lungfull! is the only journal in the world that prints the
rough drafts of everyone's work in addition to the final version so you
can see the process from beginning to end. Last year, as you may
recall, we hired a crazy person to start a subway track fire during the
event, so everyone would be stuck at zinc all night, forced to buy
drinks & magazines. But our operative got ahead of himself & set the
fire *before* the event so many people got stuck enroute & missed the
whole thing. This year, we PROMISE not to pull any such cockamamie
shenanigans, but you still might want to allot a little extra time
because the trains are always screwed up on weekends.  Also, many
people had the flu last year & so couldn't make the scene.  This year,
I have assurances from Gita the bartender that she will be serving only
top-notch FLUid SHOTS of your favorite immuno-stimulating booze in her
role as Lungfull Magazine Health Commissioner.

As your host for the evening, I do hope you can make it, especially if
we haven't crossed paths in awhile/ever.
If you are of a mind to, perhaps you could send this on to those who
might be interested in these sorts of cultural turning points.
You could also write back & say hi & perhaps have your email run as a
letter to the editor in the *next* issue.

on the wing,
Brendan Lorber

I have been teaching in the NYC Department of Education for five years. As
many of you know, this is an extremely abusive system & I need to get out. I
would like to find an adjunct position somewhere in NYC. Just adjunct - not
looking for anything too ambitious. Does anyone know of any openings or how
to start the process? I have numerous publications, a NYFA, and a pending
book from a university press.

Thanks,

Jennifer Bartlett

A kind person advised me to write more about myself re: needing advice on
getting an adjunct position. I have three degrees - an BA in English from
UNM, an MFA in poetry from Vermont College, and an MA in English with an
emphasis in teaching English from Brooklyn College. I have taught English in
high school for five years, and am more than willing to teach composition,
although poetry would be great.

Will Clemency be Granted? We Interview Snoop Dogg Will Clemency Be Granted?

An Interview w/ Snoop Dogg & Tookie Williams

You can peep the interview by going here:

http://odeo.com/audio/490410/view


Yesterday, (Dec 7th) we rolled up to San Quentin prison and caught up
with Snoop Dogg who finally was allowed inside the walls to visit with
'Big Tookie' aka Stan 'Tookie' Williams.

For those who don't know Mr. Williams is the co-founder of the Crips
gang and was convicted of murdering 4 people 25 years ago. During his
time behind bars he rehabilitated and started calling for peace and
renounced his Crip affiliation. He has written a number of children's
books advocating for kids to go down the right path and to avoid gang
life. So profound was his work that he got nominated for a Noble Peace
prize 5 times.

One thing is certain his redemption has inspired current gang members to
move in the direction of peace. He has definitely inspired Snoop Dogg...

In any case we caught up with Snoop who held an impromptu press
conference as he was leaving San Quentin and asked him what he thought
about the whole situation...

He spoke about the spirit of Tookie and how he was moved by him. he
talked about what Tookie meant to fellow gang bangers and why he would
be better alive then dead. he also talked about the enormous
responsibility Arnold Schwartznegger had in terms of turning down or
granting him clemency. Snoop was definitely on point with his remarks.

Earlier this week fellow journalist and community activist Jasmyne A.
Cannick got a chance to interview Stan Tookie Williams. He talked to her
about his redemption and why he was hoping to the Governor will do the
right thing and spare his life.

We play excerpts from that interview... You will also hear sound
excerpts from Malik Shabbazz from the New Black Panther Party, Fred
Hampton Jr. of the POCC and Aqeela Sherill of the Peace Warriors.. Also
big shout out to author Adissa Banjoko for the commentary which is also
included on here

Today December 8th the Governor of California is holding a private
hearing for Tookie Williams to hear him out and will later make a
decision...

Hi Bill---

Thanks for writing--I think the crisis with underfunded schools and artist
and entertainment types are very intertwined.
Obviously, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the "new technology"---

(for instance, there was that satire in The Onion a few months back about
the guy who finally broke down after 10 years and got a cell phone
which he used to call up NPR from his car to decry the "loss of public
spaces"---they got it down kinda brilliantly)

So yes sure I have to avoid the temptation to champion
"primitive" luddite, or whatever else I may invoke as theories
of "cultural decay" and be, uh,
"nostalgic for a time before i was even born"

For looking at larger issues like the way the car and TV (more so than
radio, I'd say--though to some extent TV was an "extension" of the radio)
changed cultural life in America---and how the changes, after a brief,
and exciting transitional period, have now become normalized,
and now seeing the web similarly normalized for many teens,
it tends to render obsolete many identity-forming "standards"
a previous generation may still appeal to.

For instance, in the mass-media of recorded music, there has been,
along with the rise of the CD, the "death of the single," and
the marginalization of the more autonomous (relatively speaking)
"personality DJ" on the radio. The implications of this are too
broad to go into here (and probably of not the most interest to
a poetics list)---but people who grew up accepting these primary
modes of cultural reproduction in that sphere find themselves groping to
try to understand what exactly has replaced them (and many are fumbling
around the web, etc).

Now, if one thinks (however "subjectively") that these older modes
enabled a more vital cultural dialogue---as the baby boomer generation
cultural critics are often fond of doing--that the art that was "allowed"
to be more popular "once upon a time" was actually "better"---and that
the mode of production enabled that. Not just because one could have a hit
single with raw (CHEAPLY PRODUCED!) garage rock in 1966, but also because
the single was less bulky than an album, or, later, people "UPGRADING THEIR
ALBUM COLLECTIONS to CDS"---to, in effect, reify and rigidify a certain
CANON you might say. Consumers in the 80s/90s became way more encouraged
to "upgrade" their old album collections (bonus tracks were thrown in for
the skeptics) than check out newer things. And there was more of a PROFIT
margin for the record companies in doing this. The switch from singles to
albums that took place in "pop music" in the 60s also became progressively
more normalized, even as the "art rock" thing went back to the older mode
of an album largely being a few "hits" with a good deal of "filler" (as in
ealry motown albums), but in 1965, you didn't HAVE to get the album. By
1995, you did---and so "consumers" tried to subvert this with napster and
such.

Anyway, similarly with schools---basically ever since brown v. board of
education allegedly desegrated public schools, there have been attempts to
de-fund public schools, although it took awhile for this movement to gain
steam---the "reagan revolution" "school vouchers" etc. The analogy with the
"music biz" (above) is only partially explained by racism--Privitization
ends up becoming the bastard child of the Great Society when it comes to
"higher education." The FLOWERING of "higher education" in the late 60s
through the 80s, in which colleges were largely opened up to lower class
whites, women, and "minorities" more than ever before at first, like the
so-called DEMOCRATIZATION that pop-top 40 radio allowed around that same
time, at first had great liberating potential. But soon, after the late 70s
"student-loan" act (which allowed or maybe even "forced" the prices of
colleges to go up), and people with BAs and MAs and even Ph.Ds now flooded
the "marketplace" and the degrees became devalued (for many, an MA in 1990
was somewhat analogous to a highschool degree in 1960)---meaning access to
the means of cultural production for both became equally limited.

When I say "cultural malaise" then, I don't mean that there isn't as much
GREAT STUFF being produced today, whether intellectually, artistically or
in the entertainment industry, but that it does seem, empirically, much
more difficult for people to find it or to be heard as the mass media has
a much smaller tolerance for eclecticism and difference than it once did.
Conspiracy theories can come in handy here, but of course it's probably
better to not let the question rest with "what went wrong" but rather try
to figure out how this can be "subverted" or at least "changed". So, I keep
coming up with quotes like "if a fool persists in his folly" or "I will
never cease from menta fight"---but it can't be purely MENTAL, can it?
At least not for me. Like what does the desire, and frankly, NEED, to shake
things up---without losing a sense a fun--mean today? What can it mean
today? Working one-on-one, seeking out individuals on, say, MYSPACE may not
be the most efficient way of trying to build a network or coalition in the
absence of vital local culture, or the absence of a "national promotional
campaign" that allegedly understands the proper rules and is too often
(whether in the field of books, music, teaching, etc) a form of censorship
based on credentials and a fear of risk-taking. But it's definitely better
than just sitting at home, or with a few friends at a bar, resigning
ourselves to not being heard, which, for me, is ultimately a kind of
selfish fear of GIVING--not that I want to go too far into the "death or
glory" thing. I mean I like to QUIP and make fun of (almost to the point of
discreding) say Ezra Pound for saying he lose his center trying to fight the
world, but the "cultural malaise" of which I speak is ONE with the idea
of living in one of the RICHEST countries in the world and in which people
whose city was destroyed by a hurricane are offered little to no help
whatsoever. A Basic helplessness in part because the MEDIATORS have once
again become more like WALLS than BRIDGES---despite some hopes after the
salves were "freed" that there could be "social progress."

It's precisely the myth of "social progress" that has engendered the
reversion! Unfortunately, the web, like "upward mobility" promised by "white
collar" jobs (and the myth of college), as well as the "revolutions" in the
mode of productions in the entertainment industry, has based so much of its
"aura" on such a myth of social progress, and even if it's ULTIMATELY not
any worse than previous modes, it certaintly isn't SOCIAL progress, at least
not in and of itself. A tool perhaps, yes---but at what cost?

Okay, blah blah, Chris

Dear Chris

Greetings

I'm still trying to work out how to tune my wiki.

The trend in music sale and distribution is by download of single songs =
from
the internet (for payment) and the concept of 'the album' has gone out =
the
door. Young people download as many songs as they can afford or store on
theit mobile music players. Wouldn't that signal the death of the cd and =
the
rise of the single again?

Thanks for your analysis of the late 60s and 70s in the usa, it seems we
share many similarities in australia, but lag behind in so-called =
education
reforms like paying for your degree after you've finished(1993),
privatisation of tertiary education, etc..

I still don't have a mobile phone, but i am not a luddite, i have chosen =
not
to be dependent on that particular communication device. I do however =
spend
several hours a day on-line and emailing.

I have embraced the internet as a creative tool and not a technology to
replace other technologies. I don't see a binary opposition old vs new
technology at all. Most binary oppositions can be shown to be =
differences in
degree rather than kind anyway. The internet is not a place to remediate =
old
media, although it is very good for this purpose, it is an experimental
space characterised by collaborative projects(like wiki), =
interconnectivity,
greater user participation(interactivity), and as a polysemiotic system =
of
reading and writing using all kinds of media elements as textons. Past
arguments of which semiotic system best describes the way the world is
'read' have set up oppositions text/image, text/music, music/image etc. =
the
reality is that we use all kinds of systems to 'read' the world and the
internet and multimedia software is allowing that kind of new media
writing/composing for the medium of the web.

the internet for me is a gypsy caravan and too many people just drive it

|||Subject: Re: drummer seeks musicians to play wiki
|||
|||Hi Bill---
|||
|||Thanks for writing--I think the crisis with underfunded schools and
|||artist
|||and entertainment types are very intertwined.
|||Obviously, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the "new technology"---
|||
|||(for instance, there was that satire in The Onion a few months back =
about
|||the guy who finally broke down after 10 years and got a cell phone
|||which he used to call up NPR from his car to decry the "loss of =
public
|||spaces"---they got it down kinda brilliantly)
|||
|||So yes sure I have to avoid the temptation to champion
|||"primitive" luddite, or whatever else I may invoke as theories
|||of "cultural decay" and be, uh,
|||"nostalgic for a time before i was even born"
|||
|||For looking at larger issues like the way the car and TV (more so =
than
|||radio, I'd say--though to some extent TV was an "extension" of the =
radio)
|||changed cultural life in America---and how the changes, after a =
brief,
|||and exciting transitional period, have now become normalized,
|||and now seeing the web similarly normalized for many teens,
|||it tends to render obsolete many identity-forming "standards"
|||a previous generation may still appeal to.
|||
|||For instance, in the mass-media of recorded music, there has been,
|||along with the rise of the CD, the "death of the single," and
|||the marginalization of the more autonomous (relatively speaking)
|||"personality DJ" on the radio. The implications of this are too
|||broad to go into here (and probably of not the most interest to
|||a poetics list)---but people who grew up accepting these primary
|||modes of cultural reproduction in that sphere find themselves groping =
to
|||try to understand what exactly has replaced them (and many are =
fumbling
|||around the web, etc).
|||
|||Now, if one thinks (however "subjectively") that these older modes
|||enabled a more vital cultural dialogue---as the baby boomer =
generation
|||cultural critics are often fond of doing--that the art that was =
"allowed"
|||to be more popular "once upon a time" was actually "better"---and =
that
|||the mode of production enabled that. Not just because one could have =
a
|||hit
|||single with raw (CHEAPLY PRODUCED!) garage rock in 1966, but also =
because
|||the single was less bulky than an album, or, later, people "UPGRADING
|||THEIR
|||ALBUM COLLECTIONS to CDS"---to, in effect, reify and rigidify a =
certain
|||CANON you might say. Consumers in the 80s/90s became way more =
encouraged
|||to "upgrade" their old album collections (bonus tracks were thrown in =
for
|||the skeptics) than check out newer things. And there was more of a =
PROFIT
|||margin for the record companies in doing this. The switch from =
singles to
|||albums that took place in "pop music" in the 60s also became
|||progressively
|||more normalized, even as the "art rock" thing went back to the older =
mode
|||of an album largely being a few "hits" with a good deal of "filler" =
(as
|||in
|||ealry motown albums), but in 1965, you didn't HAVE to get the album. =
By
|||1995, you did---and so "consumers" tried to subvert this with napster =
and
|||such.
|||
|||Anyway, similarly with schools---basically ever since brown v. board =
of
|||education allegedly desegrated public schools, there have been =
attempts
|||to
|||de-fund public schools, although it took awhile for this movement to =
gain
|||steam---the "reagan revolution" "school vouchers" etc. The analogy =
with
|||the
|||"music biz" (above) is only partially explained by =
racism--Privitization
|||ends up becoming the bastard child of the Great Society when it comes =
to
|||"higher education." The FLOWERING of "higher education" in the late =
60s
|||through the 80s, in which colleges were largely opened up to lower =
class
|||whites, women, and "minorities" more than ever before at first, like =
the
|||so-called DEMOCRATIZATION that pop-top 40 radio allowed around that =
same
|||time, at first had great liberating potential. But soon, after the =
late
|||70s
|||"student-loan" act (which allowed or maybe even "forced" the prices =
of
|||colleges to go up), and people with BAs and MAs and even Ph.Ds now
|||flooded
|||the "marketplace" and the degrees became devalued (for many, an MA in
|||1990
|||was somewhat analogous to a highschool degree in 1960)---meaning =
access
|||to
|||the means of cultural production for both became equally limited.
|||
|||When I say "cultural malaise" then, I don't mean that there isn't as =
much
|||GREAT STUFF being produced today, whether intellectually, =
artistically or
|||in the entertainment industry, but that it does seem, empirically, =
much
|||more difficult for people to find it or to be heard as the mass media =
has
|||a much smaller tolerance for eclecticism and difference than it once =
did.
|||Conspiracy theories can come in handy here, but of course it's =
probably
|||better to not let the question rest with "what went wrong" but rather =
try
|||to figure out how this can be "subverted" or at least "changed". So, =
I
|||keep
|||coming up with quotes like "if a fool persists in his folly" or "I =
will
|||never cease from menta fight"---but it can't be purely MENTAL, can =
it?
|||At least not for me. Like what does the desire, and frankly, NEED, to
|||shake
|||things up---without losing a sense a fun--mean today? What can it =
mean
|||today? Working one-on-one, seeking out individuals on, say, MYSPACE =
may
|||not
|||be the most efficient way of trying to build a network or coalition =
in
|||the
|||absence of vital local culture, or the absence of a "national =
promotional
|||campaign" that allegedly understands the proper rules and is too =
often
|||(whether in the field of books, music, teaching, etc) a form of
|||censorship
|||based on credentials and a fear of risk-taking. But it's definitely
|||better
|||than just sitting at home, or with a few friends at a bar, resigning
|||ourselves to not being heard, which, for me, is ultimately a kind of
|||selfish fear of GIVING--not that I want to go too far into the "death =
or
|||glory" thing. I mean I like to QUIP and make fun of (almost to the =
point
|||of
|||discreding) say Ezra Pound for saying he lose his center trying to =
fight
|||the
|||world, but the "cultural malaise" of which I speak is ONE with the =
idea
|||of living in one of the RICHEST countries in the world and in which
|||people
|||whose city was destroyed by a hurricane are offered little to no help
|||whatsoever. A Basic helplessness in part because the MEDIATORS have =
once
|||again become more like WALLS than BRIDGES---despite some hopes after =
the
|||salves were "freed" that there could be "social progress."
|||
|||It's precisely the myth of "social progress" that has engendered the
|||reversion! Unfortunately, the web, like "upward mobility" promised by
|||"white
|||collar" jobs (and the myth of college), as well as the "revolutions" =
in
|||the
|||mode of productions in the entertainment industry, has based so much =
of
|||its
|||"aura" on such a myth of social progress, and even if it's ULTIMATELY =
not
|||any worse than previous modes, it certaintly isn't SOCIAL progress, =
at
|||least
|||not in and of itself. A tool perhaps, yes---but at what cost?

The Poetry Project at

St. Mark's Church, 131 E. 10th St., New York, NY 10003

presents

Wednesday, December 14

8:00pm

Pierre Joris & Nicole Peyrafitte with Diallo House on acoustic bass

Rain Taxi praised Pierre Joris' collection, Poasis: Selected Poems =20
1986-1999, for "its physical, philosophical delight in words and =20
their reverberations." Since then he has published two chapbooks of =20
poetry: Permanent Diaspora and  The Rothenberg Variations. In 2003 =20
Wesleyan brought out his collection of essays A Nomad Poetics. Recent =20=

translations include 4x1: Work by Tristan Tzara, Rainer Maria Rilke, =20
Jean-Pierre Duprey & Habib Tengour (Inconundrum  Press, 2002), Paul =20
Celan: Selections (University of California Press,  2005), and =20
Lightduress by Paul Celan (Green Integer, 2004), which won the 2005 =20
PEN Award for Translation.  With Jerome Rothenberg he edited the =20
award-winning  anthologies Poems for the Millennium and, most =20
recently from Exact Change, Pablo Picasso, The Burial of the Count of =20=

Orgaz & Other Poems. During the fall of 2005 he was in Morocco, =20
working on translations of  Maghrebian poets. Visit Pierre Joris's =20
website at www.albany.edu/~joris/.


Multimedia performance artist Nicole Peyrafitte was born in Luchon =20
(French Pyrenees). As an autodidact, she considers each step of her =20
work an attempt to fulfill her compulsion to learn through a process =20
of immersion that generates performances incorporating voice / =20
paintings / videos / writing & often cooking. Peyrafitte performs =20
locally, nationally and in Europe. Among other venues, she has =20
performed in The Emerson Gallery in Berlin (Germany), The Walker Art =20
Center in Minneapolis, SUNY Buffalo, The University of Rochester, =20
Festival Occitania Toulouse, France. Nicole Peyrafitte was voted Best =20=

Performance Artist of the Capital Region 2005 for her multimedia =20
performance The Bi-Continental Chowder. Anne Waldman has described =20
her work as "both stunningly beautiful and powerfully unnerving... =20
[Peyrafitte] is the chthonic goddess come to tempt you, scare you, =20
transform you. She is in the poetic lineage of Greek tragedy, Caf=E9 =20
Voltaire antics, of dada and surrealist play but with a post-modern, =20
hip sensibility. I am transfixed when she's on stage." For more info: =20=

* * *

for those interested in French Chansons:

(the night before the Poetry gig):

Tuesday Dec 13 th from 7:30-11PM,

Nicole Peyrafitte will be singing a program of Mostly French Songs  =20
with  Bassist  Michael Bisio. For the jazz aficionados  Bisio has =20
played and/or recorded with Barbara Donald, Wayne Horvitz, Bob Nell, =20
Andrew Hill, Sonny Simmons, John Tchicai, Bern Nix, Jim Nolet, Joe =20
McPhee, Vinny Golia, Van Manakas, Greg Bendian, Carter Jefferson, =20
Charles Gayle, and Marilyn Crispell. He brings a unique touch to the =20
French Cabaret repertoire.

They will be at:

The Flea Market Caf=E9 & Restaurant
131 Ave. A (Tompkins Square) NYC

This is a good  traditional French Bistro
Price Range: Moderate
The Soupe =E0 l'oignon is delicious ( almost as good as mine!)
The steak frites genuine
& do not miss the Mousse au Chocolat 10/10

Jennifer, It would be a shame (I think) to lose all your benefits and
salary. Couldn't you look for a better situation/school now that there is n=

such thing as seniority transfers?

Subject:      "Pentagon.mil" question
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Just as a paranoid point of curiosity - at least for those working in the
Blogosphere (and perhaps elsewhere) along with "Sitemeter" - have people
been getting 'hits' from "pentagon.mil". This one just appeared on my
Sitemeter within a day after I posted a London Independent article on the
Pinter Nobel Prize speech as well as - on a couple of listservs (including
this one) - I  posted the letter from the Mexican artist who got banished
from the USA for his collaboration with a USA artist on video game about
Mexican/USA border issues.

It might just be the rare poet working in the Pentagon with a spare moment
to do a little R&R on my blog, and possibly others.  I would think, anyone
doing serious Government/Military surveillance would have a 'pen' name
rather than "Pentagon.mil' as an identifier. But it may be an 'implied
threat' to speech that makes the use of the moniker more effective.

If interested in a timely piece on surveillance - as well as more malignant
forms of state intervention - I suggest an article in this months ART
Forum's "Book Forum" magazine on Richard Wright's years in Paris until his,
perhaps, mysterious premature death (1946 - 1960). Even though an ex-Member
and open critic of the Communist Party, he was constantly trailed by agents
(from the McCarthy Senate Committee, among several others)the most haunting
image in the essay is that of David Shein - who worked with Roy Cohn and
McCarthy - 'visiting' Wright in his Paris apartment (who was meeting with
Chester Himes, the novelist and fellow expatriate, at the same time). Shein
tried to threaten and insist that Wright and Himes snitch on former members
and their associates in the Party. They, of course, refused. Compounding
Wright's situation were the spies that followed him everywhere, easy to
identify because many of these so called 'informants' were
African-Americans.

The penetration of surveillance and the distrust that it created in Wright's
Paris are not a pretty site to imagine for any writer or artist who goes
public with criticism of this country's leaders policies, actions and
politics.

Interestingly enough the Senate is about to vote on the extension of the
Patriot Act for another four years - that's through the next Presidential
Election folks!

I wouldn't worry about it. I get the occasional .mil hit, although usually
the military uses proxies -- i.e., all web requests bounce via a few
centralized machines. Why they do this I don't know -- either to provide
privacy for the browsers, or to allow for simpler monitoring of the
reading habits of their employees.

When I contributed to a political blog a few years ago, I noticed a far
greater number of .mil hits. My guess is that there is really nothing
nefarious going on: .mil people procrastinate and websurf just as much as
anyone, .mil people with web access are likely to be well-educated and
interested in literature, and there are all sorts of reasons why someone
would end up at your blog.

Yours,

Simon

      To maintain good looks under exhausting conditions, think about an
        eskimo
      Riding a white horse through a valley filled with falling other
eskimos
      So that he always has to be attentive, so that no eskimo falls on his
head.
      This will give you an alert look, which is half of beauty.

  A Song for Lennon Day: December 8, 2005


  He’s the process right now in his singing—
  a “tree in the ear”.
  He’s transparent-voiced, you can hear through him.
  Everybody everywhere knows the words,
  no greater magic.
  It’s a rolling rock, a rocking roll,
  gives deep reasons for highness,
  high reasons for deepness, said “you go” to me.

  He’s the process right now in his being—
  “conversant with transformation”.
  He’s not bigger than Jesus but better,
  nearer in history to our quandaries,
  closer in victory to our heart-strings,
  affecting catharses,
  pity & terror coming together.

Hi Chris,

You responded to offers of information from a "cranky" place, and I
ramped that up to a foolishly "cranky" level: vastly overreacting to
your crankiness. For that, I apologize.

I would also like to say: a few months ago, I was complaining about the
degradation of the list, and in my opinion: it has more-or-less fully
recovered. Discussion is lively, and generally more civilized than I.

Anyway, a mailing list is not the best place for giving out factual
answers. It is the best place for the discussion of opinions. Since you
didn't know what a wiki was, it seemed pointless to give you my opinions
on wiki technology. But, I will now. It is my opinion that, on a
discussion group such as this, the majority opinion will always receive
the most attention, regardless of whether or not it is the most educated
opinion. That's not anyone's fault. It's inherent to the format. When we
are discussing future events, such as the direction of poetry, that's
fine and dandy. When we're discussing word definitions (except in highly
specialized and abstract cases, such as the word VISPO), it's generally
shite. A web page (or book) by an acknowledged expert is the place to
go. Wikis, on the other hand, are ideal for consensus-building. Whereas
a mailing list naturally gravitates towards majority opinion, a wiki
naturally gravitates towards compromise. For an outstanding example, I
suggest you check out the entry in Wikipedia.org for "Amiri Baraka."
Each entry on Wikipedia has a link called "discussion" that allows you
to read the comments of those who worked on the entry. A few months ago,
when I read the notes on Baraka, they were a beautiful example of people
with extremely disparate views working together, in good faith, to write
a description of Baraka that included a respectful presentation of the
facts, along with the many diverse opinions the man has inspired. They
weren't terribly close to a final draft, when I last read the notes, but
they were behaving with a dignity and sense of manners that I'd never
seen in regards to Baraka's controversies. To the degree that wiki
technology facilitates such behavior, it has (at least one) clearly
defined and legitimate purpose.

I'm not a wiki administrator. I would be inclined to use a group blog
for communal writing. Wikis, however, are more easily searched and
cross-referenced by subject and keyword, so if that's relevant, a wiki
is a little easier on the site designer.

Hope that helps,
--

A rat devours the new baby in the cradle
Mommy has gone to the restaurant to wash dishes
A rat slips in and out of a freshly buried corpse

Chris,

wow, thanks for the thoughts. I think you raise a little of great
questions, and since a discussion of this sort is by definition bogged
down in big issues, questions, and generalizations, it's probably best
NOT served up in writing -- something to talk about and mull over, in
other words.

I'll add two items which occurred to me while reading your response. I
came across a couple articles recently that lend some empirical weight
to this thread -- one describing some new "root" software that Sony
either is going to or recently has added to its production CDs that
effectively make it impossible (and potentially destructive, if I got
it right) to copy them. This would be the latest in efforts to redesign
the delivery hardware to make duplication of this and other kinds
difficult, and I don't know how well it has or could succeed in the age
of hackers, crackers, and lingering "use" rights, but the battle goes
on. Let's keep in mind that broadcast rights were sold like property in
the early 20th century, out of thin air, literally, and taken away from
individual and community-based radio broadcasters -- and that itself a
logical outgrowth of artificially rarifying "free" spaces for profit.
There's rarely been much tolerance for free-range culture production.

The other article was about video gaming and it claimed that now
Americans (read USers) now spend more on video games than on movies --
not suprising, maybe -- and obviously a sign that the "mass" medium of
choice is shifting, as it had before from radio, to tv, to film, to
video, etc. This has prompted folks like Spielberg, if I remember
right, to urge a class of USC designers to put more "character" and
"narrative" into their games (voice of the old guard, naturally). The
author of the article rightly points out that the thrill of games (from
Pong [which I loved as a teenager!] to Grand Theft Auto) is less in
narrative than certain forms of inter-activity. Also makes the
interesting point that most games are about dying (to survive the last
level is to "master" the game and put it behind you), which may teach
something about death that movies can't/don't -- especially out of
Hwood.

This lends support to what you say, perhaps, about atomization and
walling off desire-addicted individuals and the eradication of the
public sphere, etc., but without posing as an apologist I would also
suggest that there are forms of interaction in micro-media (like games,
the web, My Space, and oh goodness, wikis) that may promote community
development in a way that mass-hypodermic models (film, TV) don't.
Obviously there are also issues of "reading" (books, that is) that are
raised here -- but, to kind of ball it all up, what's intriguing and
frustrating about it all, for me, is that there certainly are changes
underway in many if not all of the media/communication models
(networks, infrastructures, production, etc.) that make it hard to "get
a sense" of where the song, the artist, the poet, the book, the album,
the image, the art, the creativity, etc., "resides" in all this. To me
this is good and bad -- bad in so far as Sony and Viacom and
Time-Warner and Disney and other newly "liberated" content providers
can, under certain conditions laid gloriously by Reagan and his
surviving knights, rewrite the book on what it means to be a cultural
actor (producer and receiver) in the 21st century -- good in so far as
the same technologies (and techniques, practices) that squeeze the
pipeline also make it possible to jam these very efforts and redirect
flows.

Finally, I think to have faith in any form of "mass" medium as somehow
tolerant (then, now, or in  the future) of any kind of activity,
popular or otherwise, misses the point that industry is only tolerant
of what sells and is constantly seeking out the newer models and
delivery gadgets to maximize sales. I find ecclectic music everywhere
on the web, which doesn't mean that I don't have trouble paying for it
or getting it in a decent format. I'm also finding really fun old LPs
at the Salvation Army, and these days that's all I listen to.

The activist stance might be either that we reject outright and seek
out if not more primitive at least more sustainable forms of
interaction, production, etc. (all over the pages of The Fifth Estate,
for example), and I agree with that stance to a point. One other
approach might be to interfere, break, and "jam" the latest efforts of
capital to colonize all spaces and minds (AdBusters, maybe, which I
teach regularly, culture jammers, Hactivism, etc.), and this too I find
appealing. Meanwhile, I think it's okay to be both "lost" and
frustrated and keenly "aware" of what's going on -- part responsible
consumer, part communitarian, part anarchist -- cuz in the end I think
there's something to be gained in "using" what's available to
sustainable ends, conscious of course of how that use is also a
particular drain on a broad range of resources. So, with Joel for
example and the FS collective, we use the tool, as Joel put it, as far
as we need it -- but the goal is production, learning, community, and
cheap textbooks, NOT proffering a slick front for more commodities.

Thanks,

Bill

Just a moment to praise David Antin's talk on George Oppen last night at the
SF State Poetry Center's annual Oppen Lecture. T'was a beauty with David
making his 'tell-tale" circumventions in and out of Oppen's work into the
contemporary & back to the originating circumstances of George's life &
work. Not, what's the word 'hagiographic', platter/patter of praise. Hardly.
Hard on George's penchant for writing lyrics - using Mary Oppen as muse and
pulse-point - for avoiding contact with the details/conflicts/challenges of
their actual lives. Yet, in praise of the work, the chiseled craft of a
Oppen's work with words - much in the way of his trade as a carpenter - the
look for ways to make things fit, a metaphysician in search of 'truth' -
struggling to take the 'dis' out of discomfiture, the quest, even if
unlikely, to 'true-up the joints.' The voice of an aristocrat who never
confused his relationship, involvement and dedication to issues of labor,
power and politics as a false "I am one of you" identification. Though he
worked as a laborer, Oppen as an "outsider" within.

I don't want to falsely reduce a talk with much more complexity. Antin the
younger by 15 years, as well as a long time friend. The way Oppen always
appeared elder by years to any us! & Antin posing Oppen's attentions as a
foil to the present. Where does one, a poet, make language occur in a
political sense when it's of no unique use to make a poem of outrage at,
say, the Iraq war. That's too obvious. Again, Antin in a wonderful aside
about the toxicity of words, such as, for example, the word "rendition" -
how for so many years it was used to identify a contemporary singer's
revisit to a older song (a standard), and where now 'rendition' has been
made toxic - the 'return' for the accused terrorist = no return home at all,
without over elaborating the obvious.

How Oppen was looking for clean words, 'copper without rust' as he once
dreamed, and woke up to discover the word "Oppen" in "copper.'

In a time where the 'toxic' appears to define the centrality of the globe's
political, etc. climate, Antin's talk was a clarifying, human treat.

Eventually the Poetry Center's Archives will have this all on tape.

DVDs, meaning the studios make some money from DVDs that talent used to =
make
from the other formats (DVDs are EVEN MORE profitable than movies)

teenage boys are the hot market; although this used to be 18-24, about =
ten?
years ago it became 14-18, and now it is really 10-14, thus no surprise =
that
the majority of movies are made for teenage boys, as are most video =
games,
but "video games make more money than movies" tends to create a vicious
circle, where video games of course appeal to young boys, and then no =
movies
are made which don't compete with video games=20

we have a LOT of movies that are springing from video games & anime, and =
the
game companies are starting to recruit screenwriters to 1) make scripts =
from
the games, 2) to write the game, and then the script, 3) write funny =
games,
presumably with a lot of fart jokes (almost all I remember from seventh
grade are Jim Beal's telling fart jokes and his ability to turn his =
eyelids
inside out and blink).

a LOT of books published now (I've been getting several review copies a =
week
from one company -- the female characters are all vampires) are
novelizations of video games -- they're serials! -- as opposed to
novelizations of movies, which don't sell as well, and aren't serials

while the point about death is interesting, I think it might be even =
more
interesting to pursue that point -- to what extent are kids prepared for
soldiering by the culture at large?  I don't mean shooting games and
armaments, although of course the DoD / entertainment industry =
collaborative
gaming entity is headquartered here.  I mean learning about concepts =
like
nationalization, racism, hate crime, etc. where one realizes one is a =
"them"
for a large number of people, to be prepared to defend to the death, =
general
preparation for random death, to believe very strongly in a cause and =
back
that belief with violent action, etc. etc.  -- in other words, are games
appealing to kids as a result of this effect rather than causing it.

twenty five years ago, video games and computers were appealing mostly =
to
young boys who didn't have much socialization; I see a turn to =
interactivity
(games, internet) from inescapable narrative (movies) as positive

let's not forget Clinton's embrace of the V Chip and Tipper Gore's
censorship of music; the desire to sanitize content for the target
population of all the content only increases the desire of that =
population
to get full & complete information, leaving them an easy market for
products; the technologies for censorship and prevention of =
dissemination to
protect rights are the same; the purported impulses of the vague "parent
voter" are easily manipulated by corporations to support their =
increasing
control of cultural production, even if they only pay lip service to =
true
convergence.

The subject which receives the most attention on the list is the one to which there are most responses, whether pro or con. It does not relate directly to opinion.

Visual Poetry is not exactly  a defined subject, but an idea in progress to which different points of view and practitioners may respond. Hopefully, as a result, the potentialities of the form/concept become "blurred, therefore, clearer." For me, a list is not a place where definitions are set and authorities assigned; but a playground of ideas -where they are kicked and bounced around. That's how ideas lose their definitions (virginities so to speak).

As I said, the list gravitates to discussion, not majority opinion, if rules do not prevent it.

Nor should you. Baraka is a pivotal writer who embodies ideological, racial,  fault lines in our culture. The intense reactions both positive and negative his work arouses (as a Jew. a poet and a New Yorker I experience the contrary feelings) points to its relevance and relation to reality. When did "dignity and sense of manners" become the ideals of internet virtue anyway?

I do not want to become nostalgic about flaming, but...

Let me try to explain my difficulty with wiki, which when I first read and to this day confuse with kiwi. I think a lot of these new modes (starting with the innocence of blogs) are attempts to pull in new hits, an aspect of what used to be called "capitalistic competition." Their creative energy is driven by the same need as changing a commercial periodically.

When Chris refers to the discrepancy between the proliferation of these modes and the pace of his poetic/creative impulse (his exact words escape me), I think he was responding to the alien  pace of this capitalist rhythm (capitalism as an infernal machine). Of course, Chris may correct me if I have misread him.

I think there is a tendency to treat too uncritically the totality of the internet as a medium. There is nothing "natural" about it (Jonathan, how many times did you used the word "natural" in your last post?). If the thinking of the last fifty years taught us anything, it is to look sceptically at the "mediasphere" (meta-meta-blogspheres?) to which we belong.

Ciao.

Right, but... the way to approach a given subject that will attract the
most attention is the way that the majority approaches that subject.

That's interesting. How is it that you believe a wiki generates more
"hits" than a blog? Or a blog more than a simple HTML page?

How is it uncritical to try to accurately, and factually, understand
something?

I recommend the works of Chellis Glendinning for information on a
neo-Luddite philosophy that is not technophobic. I assume you are using
more "poetic license" when you claim that the Internet comes from hell,
but I nonetheless promise you that it's only a tool, and therefore
follows the laws of nature.

Yours,

Subject:      net art in twenty years
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

here's a shockwave sonic piece called 'granular synthesizer' by chris savage
from manchester: http://www.japanesefreeware.com/granular

i know altavista permits sound search, like google, yahoo and altavista
permit image search. in 'granular synthesizer', you type in the sound you
want and 'granular synthesizer' retrieves it from the net and then processes
and plays it in configurable ways. it creates an unusual perspective on
common sounds, on what we hear, on the natural, the 'musical', the digital
and 'art'.

it's an example of a type of net art that is becoming more widely practiced
than it has been over the last ten years. 'granular synthesizer' lets the
player type in what they want to hear, retrieves the sound, and also lets
players store their wee creations on the net for others to hear. the ability
to create works that retrieve and store all sorts of different types of
information from all sorts of different information sources on the net is a
bit easier than it once was (via languages like PHP and Actionscript) and,
also, the data feeds are more numerous than they once were. altavista has
video search now, and i see google has it in beta. google also supplies
"API"s (application programming interfaces) which allow programmers to query
the Google databases and retrieve search results. such APIs are more
prevelant than they were. i gather Flickr also provides an API that will let
programmers create applications that search and load Flickr images.

so what?

i think we're starting to see what net art will be in twenty years. it has
been commonplace to say that net art works should take advantage of the
properties of the internet in deeply artistic ways, ie, net art works should
require a net connection and do very funky shit with that connection. the
response to such a prescription has been understandably resistant. because
it *is* a prescription, but also because it's been very tough to create such
works and the data feeds have been relatively few.

there hasn't been a whole lot of net art that does very funky shit with the
internet connection. most net art could as well be experienced on CD without
a net connection. and, sure, that's net art. i am not out to argue that it
isn't. but i do think that the edge of net art will continue to be strongly
involved with trying to do funky shit with an internet connection. why?
well, that's a crucial distinguishing characteristic of net art versus other
types of art, and it's usually the case that the unique characteristics of a
medium or a person or whatever are crucial to the entity's identity, to the
key strengths and weaknesses.

being able to query and retrieve information from the net, in net art works,
can potentially lend them greater relevance to the moment, and also give
them greater range and scope as works of art and/or as intelligences of some
sort. when we ourselves respond to the moment, we bring to it a vast sea of
memory and experience, of possible interpretation and response. clearly the
Internet has become a vast sea of memory, of text, image, sound, video, etc.

but how does one bring this information to bear in a relevant and exciting
way to the moment?

it's starting to be the case that net art works at least have increasing
access to the information stored on the internet. when we ourselves respond
to the moment, we not only need access to our own memories, but we need to
be able to search our memories for relevant information and bring those to
bear on our response in a relevant way. that sort of intelligence seems a
long way off concerning net art works.

however, you can sort of see that one of the more exciting directions of net
art--including literary strains of net art--will be the funky shit it does
with an internet connection concerning how it retrieves information/memory
of many types from around the net and brings that to bear on the moment. we
will glimpse an 'evolution' of approaches to art and intelligence through
this work.

     "... Those military vehicles could have taken us to any dry, safe

in there, and they backed up all their authority with military M-16s.
And there were thousands and thousands of people. On the last day we
were in there -- and let me tell you something -- they hand-picked the
white people to ride out first. Yes, racism was very much involved. They

95% people of color in that place." -- Leah Hodges

New Orleans Evacuees and Activists Testify at Explosive House Hearing on
the Role of Race and Class in Government's Response to Hurricane Katrina

Friday, December 9th, 2005
http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/09/1443240

Three months after Hurricane Katrina ripped through the southern coast
of the United States, decimating communities in Mississippi and
Louisiana, we play excerpts of an explosive congressional hearing
focusing on race and the government's response to the disaster.
[includes rush transcript]

It has been three months since Hurricane Katrina ripped through the
southern coast of the United States, decimating communities in
Mississippi and Louisiana. After the initial slow government response to
the disaster, President Bush flew to the region and promised the
government will "do what it takes, stay as long as it takes, to help our
citizens rebuild their communities and their lives." Well that promise
is feeling increasingly hollow to many people.

Today is the start of the Survivors General Assembly and Strategy
Conference in Jackson, Mississippi. Katrina survivors are gathering at
this conference and demanding the right to return to their homes and to
take part in the reconstruction process. They are also calling for
reparations for what they say is the government's criminal indifference
and malicious actions towards the survivors before, during and after
Katrina.

But survivors are not the only ones speaking out. Local reporters and
politicians from both sides of the aisle have criticized the
government's inaction.

On Wednesday, Mississippi Republican Governor Haley Barbour, a staunch
Bush supporter and former chair of the Republican National Committee
stated, "we are at a point where our recovery and renewal efforts are
stalled because of inaction in Washington D.C." Barbour went on to say
there was no money to rebuild highways and bridges and school districts
were close to bankruptcy. And he was just referring to Mississippi.

The city of New Orleans remains in a state of emergency with most
residents unable to return. Many say they have been abandoned by the
federal government, the same way they were abandoned during the first
days of the storm. The Times-Picayune carried an editorial on the front
page recently pleading "Do Not Let the City Die." Local advocates say
the government is not committed to rebuilding the city for all of its
citizens. They point to the fact that few public housing units have been
reopened and that landlords are being allowed to evict people in mass
numbers.

80% of New Orleans residents have not returned. And those who have are
mostly white and wealthy. African-Americans especially feel the
government is not making an effort to ensure that they are able to
return. A group of homeless evacuees are filing a lawsuit in Federal
Court today contending that FEMA engaged in illegal practices by denying
or delaying their requests for temporary housing. They are also
demanding that the agency back off of its plan to kick people out of
their hotels in the coming days. The FEMA deadline for evacuees to be
out of their hotels is December 15th with evacuees in some states
granted until January 7th to find new housing.

A recent poll conducted by the Washington Post found 61% of evacuees
sampled in Houston said their experience since Katrina has made them
think that the government doesn't care about them. 68% of those surveyed
believed that the federal government would have responded more quickly
if people trapped in the city were "wealthier and white rather than
poorer and black."

On Tuesday, a special House Select Committee held a hearing focusing on
the role of race and class in the government's response to Katrina. The
hearing was requested by Georgia Representative Cynthia McKinney. She
was one of the few Democrats to participate. It was a most unusual
hearing - one that we rarely see on Capitol Hill. Survivors and
activists testified that racism was a big reason so many were abandoned
and allowed to die.

* Excerpts of House Select Committee hearing on the government's
response to Katrina. Among those who testified:
- Ishmael Muhammad, attorney for the Advancement Project and part of the
People's Hurricane Relief Fund.
- Leah Hodges, New Orleans evacuee.
- Dyan French, New Orleans community leader.
- Harry Alford, president and CEO of the National Black Chamber of Commerce.

AMY GOODMAN: We'll turn now to excerpts from that hearing. We hear first
from Ishmael Muhammad, an attorney for the Advancement Project, part of
the People's Hurricane Relief Fund.

ISHMAEL MUHAMMAD: The purpose of the People's Hurricane Relief Fund and
Mississippi Disaster Relief Coalition is to insure that those who have
suffered the most before, during and after Katrina, and whose voices
have been historically disregarded, are empowered to be heard and take
charge of the monies being raised in their names, the reconstruction of
their communities, and the repairing of their lives. Therefore, the
testimony that I'm going to give today, on behalf of the legal work that
we're doing and on behalf of the People's Hurricane Relief Fund and the
Mississippi Disaster Relief Coalition, will be from those voices. And we
urge all of you to seek out those voices that we cannot bring you today.

Denise, a 42-year-old black woman from New Orleans, interned in the
Convention Center, reports, “I thought I was in hell. I was there for
two days with no water, no food and no shelter, with my 63-year-old
mother, 21-year-old niece and two-year-old grandniece and thousands of
others. Police would not come out of their cars. National Guard trucks
rolled by, completely empty, with soldiers with guns cocked and aiming
at us. Nobody stopped to drop off water. A helicopter dropped a load of
water, but all of the bottles exploded on impact. Many people were
delirious from lack of water and food, completely dehydrated. Inside the
Convention Center, conditions were horrible. The floors were black and
slick with feces. Outside wasn't much better, between the heat, the
humidity, the lack of water, and old and very young dying from
dehydration. There were young men with guns there, who organized the
crowd and got food and water for the old people and babies, because
nobody had eaten in days. When buses came, it was those men who got the
crowd in order. Old people in front, women and children next, men in the
back. Many people decided to walk across the bridge to the west bank,
but armed police ordered them to turn around at the top of the bridge.
The first day, four people died next to me, the second day, six. Make
sure you tell everybody,” she said, “that they left us there to die.”

Nicole, a young black woman from New Orleans, who was interned in the
Superdome, states, "We survived despite being abandoned by federal,
state and local government. Black families with children and no money
were the majority in the Superdome. I noticed only 5% of people were not
black and they were mostly unfortunate white and Asian tourists. While
waiting in line behind a barricade for 18 hours to board a bus away from
the Superdome, I noticed a group of tourists, three white and two Asian
people, rushed quietly out one side of the barricade that held thousands
of exhausted, financially underprivileged black families with babies.
The looting was people's main rebellion, because it was hotter than
Satan's oven in the Dome and people wanted cold drinks, ice, anything
cold. The National Guard did not serve or protect. They were constantly
threatening us and herding us by machine guns like cows. I saw a teenage
boy beaten up by a National Guard officer in front of a crowd of
thousands of people. The National Guard was disorganized. They did not
try to instill order to the chaos of ration distribution. Nobody ever
knew when or where food was given out, and people stood in line for
hours. I was alone and female. Many of the older men and women were
protective of me in the Superdome. Nobody really laid a hand on me,
except for a white police officer, Officer Hall, badge 185 or 158 (I
wish I could remember). He grabbed my booty in Texas during a 3:00 a.m.
bus search, while we were on the way to Dallas. The U.S. is the richest
country in the world. I don't understand why so many people would have
to die in Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. has the money to evacuate people
in a disaster, especially one that has been awaited for a number of years.”

Shelly, a 31-year-old who was trapped in the Superdome, adds, "When
buses came to take us from the Superdome, they were taking tourists
first. White people, they were just picking them out of the crowd. I
don't know why we were treated the way we were. But it was like they
didn't care.”

Alva, a 51-year-old grandmother from New Orleans East, remembers, “When
we were taken to the higher ground in Jefferson Parish, what did we have
to greet us? A line of military police with M-16 rifles. They watched
us, caged us, laughed at us, took pictures of us with their
camera-phones. I saw a young man get down on his knees and beg for water
for his little baby, and I saw the child die right there on the
concrete. This was murder. They wanted us dead. They just didn't think
so many of us would survive."

Tammy, a black woman in her mid-30s, complains, “I was trying to
evacuate with my two daughters by car, when we were stopped by police,
made to get out and told, ‘Lie down on the ground, you black monkey
bitch.’ I was arrested and thrown in jail with my daughters and could
not get out for several weeks.”

John, a New Orleans resident displaced at the Houston Astrodome, says,
“I was in the Astrodome and told to move from the bleachers to the field
on the lower area, but I refused because I had seen dead bodies down
there and I was with some of my 12 children in the upstairs area. There
were just too many unsafe issues down there. I was forced to leave the
stadium. Me and my family were taken out at rifle-point.”

Agnes, a 70-something-year-old Creole woman who was a resident of
Iberville Public Housing Development; Maybell, a woman in her late-70s,
a longtime resident of St. Bernard Public Housing Development; Joseph
and Cynthia, who are residents of B.W. Cooper Public Housing
Development; and Alberta, who is a resident of Lafitte Public Housing
Development, have all been displaced, and all are wondering why they
have to be locked out of their public housing residence when their homes
have received little to no flooding and are habitable.

These stories illustrate that these are the people who need to be heard,
because their stories illustrate the failures of the government on every
level.

AMY GOODMAN: Ishmael Muhammad, an attorney for the Advancement Project
and part of the People's Hurricane Relief Fund, speaking at the House
Select Committee on the Role of Race and Class in Response to Katrina.
We'll go back to that hearing in just a minute.

[break]

AMY GOODMAN: We return to the House Select Committee Hearing on the role
of race and class in response to Hurricane Katrina. This is New Orleans
community leader, Leah Hodges, testifying.

DYAN FRENCH: Rita, Katrina, and all of the aftermath, if we are not
going to sit here and be honest about the racism --

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Right. That's right. It don’t make no sense.

DYAN FRENCH: -- that was perpetrated, then I have really, truly wasted
my time coming here.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Me, too. And I missed a day's work.

DYAN FRENCH: And I really don't want nobody to get confused. At 60, I
just don't want to call you the names that we were called. We have
documentation. We don’t have to sit in this room. I invite all of you to
please come to New Orleans. The proof is there, the proof of what
happened. Our little mayor -- and he may get offended, I don't care. He
who knows that and not that he knows not, that's how he got caught up.
You can’t get surrounding parishes to put your disaster plan together.
Most of his top staff -- and I have been appointed on most of my jobs
with the city --are people who don't live in the parish. They live in
the surrounding parishes. And that's what happened to us on the day of.
Rightfully so, the police who didn't live there stayed home and took
care of their people.

REP. JEFF MILLER: May I ask you --

DYAN FRENCH: But they had no business working for the city, because
there's a law – or ordinance that says you can’t.

REP. JEFF MILLER: May I ask you a question? You mention -- you talked
about the parishes. And this is something that I have heard people talk
about. Is it true that some parishes are refusing to allow temporary
housing of certain peoples within their parishes?

LEAH HODGES: Very true. Very true. Particularly true of [inaudible] and
Jefferson Parish. Jefferson Parish is where the Causeway concentration
camp was housed, where we experienced the Gestapo-type oppression, as
opposed to being rescued. We were three minutes away from the airport.
They could have taken us to the airport. Those military vehicles could
have taken us to any dry, safe city in America. Instead, they dumped us
at a dumping ground, sealed us in there, and they backed up all their
authority with military M-16s.

And there were thousands and thousands of people. On the last day we
were in there -- and let me tell you something -- they hand-picked the
white people to ride out first. Yes, racism was very much involved. They
hand-picked the white people to ride out first. Every day, the crowd got
darker and darker and darker until finally there were only – there were
95% people of color in that place.

REP. JEFF MILLER: Miss Hodges, would you be offended if I respectfully
asked you not to call the Causeway area a concentration camp?

LEAH HODGES: I am going to call it what it is. If I put a dress on a
pig, a pig is still a pig.

REP. JEFF MILLER: Are you familiar with the history?

LEAH HODGES: Yes, sir, I am. And that is the only thing I could compare
what we went through to: a concentration camp.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And that's the truth.

LEAH HODGES: And everybody in the place with me, the lady sitting next
to me was there, my mother was there, my younger brother was there, my
two sisters; we ran into others. That is the point, that they broke up
families and dispersed us.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: That's right.

LEAH HODGES: And they stood over us with guns and enforced their
authority, and yes, they tortured us. And then they used various forms
of torture. And yes, I know what a concentration camp is. I'm a
college-educated woman.

REP. JEFF MILLER: Not a single --

LEAH HODGES: And I love the study of history.

REP. JEFF MILLER: Not a single person was marched into a gas chamber and
killed.

LEAH HODGES: They died from abject neglect. We left body bags behind.
Pregnant women lost their babies.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: That's one of the reasons why some of these people
wouldn't come out of those houses, because you was told to come on the
street, and when people came out –

LEAH HODGES: They were shot

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: -- they were killed.

REP. TOM DAVIS: Excuse me, Mr. Miller has another minute left.

REP. JEFF MILLER: I should have more time than that, sir.

REP. TOM DAVIS: Go ahead.

REP. JEFF MILLER: Thank you. I respectfully request that you not call it
the Causeway concentration camp.

LEAH HODGES: Respectfully, sir --

REP. TOM DAVIS: Excuse me, it is Mr. Miller's time. You had your time.

REP. JEFF MILLER: Mama D, you're very smart -- all of you are smart, but
you obviously are a very smart and worldly woman.

DYAN FRENCH: I'm old.

REP. JEFF MILLER: I'm not going to say that. I ain't going there.

DYAN FRENCH: I said it. I even get my discount at the places, the
quarter coffee thing.

REP. JEFF MILLER: We’ve got the mayor coming next week.

DYAN FRENCH: You know what, I feel sorry for that baby. And let me just
say something to you, being an older person, sweetheart, any name you
call it in New Orleans, particularly in the state of Louisiana, overall
-- do you know me, Jeff? You don't just know me being my congressman?
You know me as a person in my community?

REP. WILLIAM JENNINGS JEFFERSON: Absolutely.

DYAN FRENCH: I was here with the Hispanic community two years ago when
they came about the injustices that they’re suffering in this country.
I'm always called the one that deals with -- the mentally ill and
incarcerated. I do special things for them, because I understand their
plights. My problem with all of this, and I said this. I said this in
September. I said nobody is going to believe us. This is an unbelievable
story.

AMY GOODMAN: Community leaders Dyan French and Leah Hodges, testifying
before the House Select Committee on Hurricane Katrina. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency gained national headlines for its disastrous
response to Hurricane Katrina. Months after the hurricane hit, FEMA is
still under fire for the treatment of Katrina survivors. This is New
Orleans evacuee, Leah Hodges, testifying at Tuesday's Congressional Hearing.

LEAH HODGES: FEMA has created a nightmare inside of a nightmare for some
people. I had a few people to call me and ask me to please help. I know
right now of a 70-year-old man in New Orleans who is a diabetic and a
veteran. And FEMA -- a tree fell on this man's house, and FEMA said he
has no damage, and they have not given him zip.

REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS: Before we end here, was there any government
agency or non-profit that was helpful? Not not helpful. FEMA has taken a
lot of hits from the committee. But is there any group --

LEAH HODGES: They deserve it.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: They deserve more.

REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS: Yeah, and they got it big-time. But the question
I'm asking is any government agency that has proved helpful?

LEAH HODGES: Well, I'm not really understanding helpful on a scale from
one to ten. I mean, is it helpful that I got help after they have given
me the worst case of high blood pressure that I have ever had in my life
and I have not suffered with high blood pressure before this situation?

REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS: The Red Cross? --

LEAH HODGES: Do you want to hear my answer? Now, I'm not even sure what
help is in this situation, because FEMA have been so -- they have been
hostile. You get them on the phone, they will argue with you. They ask
you a question. You answer their question. They will argue with you, and
when they send you a copy of your application back, they have put things
on your application that you don't even recognize that do not apply to
you. They interpret your answers, and they indicate the answers they
want on your application, which are guaranteed to tie you up, so that if
you get any help at all, it would not be soon forthcoming.

REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS: Any government agency that's been helpful to you
or non-profit organization?

DYAN FRENCH: You know --

LEAH HODGES: I'll tell you who has been helpful to me: The Corinthian
Church in Cincinnati, the Corinthian Baptist Church, because it is from
there that I got the strength to withstand the foolishness of FEMA,
because what FEMA do to people, you know, is criminal. Like I said,
after they have ruined my health, then they throw a few dollars at me;
is that really help? When now I need to pay to see a doctor, I don't
have medical insurance. I told them I have medical needs. They send me a
letter back telling me that they deny my medical needs on the one hand,
but fill out some papers saying I don't have health insurance. They're
not forthcoming with any medical assistance that I need, and throwing a
few dollars at me after they have driven my health to a very bad state,
no, I don't consider that help at all.

AMY GOODMAN: New Orleans evacuee and community leader, Leah Hodges. She
will be joining us live in a moment from Atlanta. She was being
questioned by Connecticut Congressmember Christopher Shays. Before that,
it was Republican Congressmember Jeff Miller of Florida, who was
questioning both Dyan French and Leah Hodges. We now turn to Ishmael
Muhammad again, the attorney for the Advancement Project.

ISHMAEL MUHAMMAD: When we talk about being truthful, and we are dealing
with an environment in which lies are consistently told to the
population. From the syphilis experiment, to not want to talk about how
many civilians and innocent people are being killed in Iraq, to the
counterintelligence program, I mean, we have a number of instances where
the government here campaigns in a way to hide its problems from the
international community and from its own population. So we saw in
Katrina a media campaign that began in a very humane way, and then all
of a sudden, take a serious turn to the same old, same old again.

We know that there was a shoot-to-kill order given in an environment
that already was problematic in terms of black people being killed by
authorities. So, just using your common sense—the sense we all got a
little bit of, at least—you give someone rearing to go, before Katrina,
in a disaster situation, a shoot-to-kill order and create an environment
where everybody is a potential looter, you are going to have people
getting shot down by police, by law enforcement authorities. And then
you have account after account after account of people being killed.
Then you have statements being made by law enforcement officials and
government officials that the only—that all deaths are going to be
identified as happening August 29th as the date and no identification is
going to be made of what actually killed anyone, what actually made
people—what actually was the reason that people died. Why is that? And
then you have reports that 10,000 people may be dead, and all of a
sudden we have a body count of a little over 1,000.

I mean, it’s important that we do our job as people in the—of the
people, to uncover the truth, and it's important that those that are
serious about the truth in the Congress do their job to push the
Congress to uncover the truth. But we have at least a number of accounts
that tell us that people were shot and killed by the police. We are
pursuing that. We will be suing on that, and let’s see if it gets
laughed out of court. Then we'll know something about the body count.

Now, about this insurance issue—and it's interesting, too, with the body
count that FEMA doesn't want to release any information. FEMA has been
asked for information after information from various organizations. We
actually got FEMA to give up some information to protect people's rights
not to get evicted from their home without notice. That was just like
the only FEMA victory so far. But FEMA doesn't want to tell anyone anything.

AMY GOODMAN: Ishmael Muhammad, an attorney for the Advancement Project,
part of the People's Hurricane Relief Fund. While plans are underway for
the rebuilding of New Orleans, many fear reconstruction contracts are
going out-of-state corporations at the expense of local workers and
businesses. This is Harry Alford, president and CEO of the National
Black Chamber of Commerce.

HARRY ALFORD: Between 9/11 and the beginning of the Iraq war, a
phenomenon happened in the federal procurement system. Certain members
of what President Eisenhower regarded as the military-industrial complex
began to look at other new markets. Today, we have this cartel that
deals with disaster recovery. It is not shocking to see that the same
companies who enjoy bundled contracts and no-bid contracts in the Iraq
war are now receiving such gravy in the Katrina recovery. FEMA has
assembled a new team, and the federal procurement system has been
hijacked. This cartel has been assembled in places such as the Capital
Grill and Palm restaurants. Scope of work has been determined in suites
along K Street in downtown D.C.

It's not about quality, but about power and greed. Money—big money, tax
money—are the rule, and ethics and procurement law have been tossed
aside. America is at risk, due to a runaway lobby train that manipulates
who gets the jobs, regardless of price, quality and due diligence.
Bona-fide and qualified companies that belong to the NBCC cannot get
into this cartel. The fees are too high and the country clubs, et al.,
don't have a policy of inclusion.

AMY GOODMAN: Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of
Commerce. He went on to talk about big business and disaster relief.

HARRY ALFORD: I’m remembering of a story told by a tactical officer in
my officer candidate school class. He said: “You men are here at Fort
Benning, Georgia, training to become lieutenants because of a certain
situation, which is Vietnam. War is business, and right now, business is
damn good.” Here you are, all husbands and many fathers with fine
college degrees and should be heading to corporate America to begin your
careers. Instead, you are draftees, because war is business, and
business is damn good. The bigger the war, the better the business.

Now, what scares me about Katrina is the thought that the bigger the
disaster, the greater the business. The 82nd Airborne can deploy
anywhere in this world in 24 hours. It took them eight days to travel
600 miles to New Orleans. National television showed the plight of New
Orleans, but FEMA would not budge, as if they never turned on the TV
set. The longer the wait, the greater the disaster, and if disaster is a
business, right now business is damn good. Let's end this nightmare.
Fortune favors courage, thank you.

REP. TOM DAVIS: Thank you, very much. I'm also a Benning alum. So, I
appreciate it.

HARRY ALFORD: All right.

REP. TOM DAVIS: Thank you very much.

AMY GOODMAN: Harry Alford, president and CEO of the National Black
Chamber of Commerce. After three hours of moving testimony, the hearing
came to a close. The Republican chair of the committee was about to end
the proceedings before he was interrupted by Congress member Cynthia
McKinney.

REP. TOM DAVIS: Let me just thank this panel. Thanks for your patience
and sitting through it. Thank you for the dialogue, and we very much
appreciate this information.

REP. CYNTHIA McKINNEY: Mr. Chairman, don't bang the gavel yet, because I
would like to have concluding words.

REP. TOM DAVIS: Ah, yeah. Ms. McKinney.

REP. CYNTHIA McKINNEY: I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
allowing us to have this day.

REP. TOM DAVIS: You can take as much time as you want on that comment.

[laughter]

REP. CYNTHIA McKINNEY: Because were it left up to—I'll get in trouble
now—but were it left up to the Democratic leadership, we would not have
had this day, because we wouldn't be here. The Democratic leadership has
instructed us to boycott this panel, because we can't trust the results
or the report of this panel. But if we participate as our constituents
voted us to do up here, we can at least insure that there's more
integrity than by boycotting it.

And so I would like to thank my chairman for giving us the opportunity
to invite people who don't have the opportunity to come and testify
before Congress, except for Barbara, of course, she comes up here a lot.
But, we’ve heard from people for whom getting here has been a struggle,
whether it's just because they are Katrina survivors at the armory, and
it was a struggle for them to get to the armory, or if they are Katrina
survivors living in New Orleans still, determined to stay there and
maybe every once in a while get a glimpse of their member of Congress.

We are here to serve all of the people of this country, and too rarely
do we hear from all of the people. But thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Mr. Shays, for staying here throughout the entirety of this hearing
to hear what my people—my people—have to say. Because the road that we
walk is not paved. Or as some great poet said, life for us ain’t been no
crystal stair.

REP. TOM DAVIS: Thank you. Cynthia, thank you very much.

AMY GOODMAN: Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia thanking Democratic
Congressmember Cynthia McKinney, who called for the hearing on race and
class as it relates to Hurricane Katrina.

I for one would belong to a list which merely collects postings from =

limits
postings from people, to accept automatically-sent notifications /

At the very least, I would like to start a discussion, or a brief
contribution of opinions, on this topic here.  Do you or don't you want =

why not?

Subject:      Geof Huth's take on Platform Independence
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Platform Independence. Geof Huth just critiqued Silliman's view on this.
Would like to see a further discussion of the differing views on and
subtleties surrounding this, especially the subtleties.

[Chris S. doesn't like links, so I've pasted what got me going on this]
Three paragraphs from Geof Huth's dbpq blog of 12/8
(http://dbqp.blogspot.com):

"So, yes, that is why I have to say that, no, I don¡¯t accept Silliman¡¯s
idea that the more valuable type of art must comply with the Blake test,
that the best art (or maybe it is only poetry?) must be platform
independent. I don¡¯t even accept that platform independence is possible¡ªa
queasy enough challenge in the world of computing and electronic records,
though one people follow, hoping it to be the holiest of grails.

Silliman¡¯s latest meditation on the Blake test concludes that spoken poetry
(and, parenthetically, visual poetry as well) will not be as¡ªwhat?¡ªstrong
or valuable or enduring as printed (and lineated) poetry because it is
trapped in a single platform: a recording format of some kind. The corollary
is that textual poetry is not platform-dependent because it can be
translated, in a natural manner, into an oral form. But this is merely a
feat of Sillimaniacal legerdemain. Both forms are equally
platform-dependent. Silliman has simply decided that the transition from the
static page to the variable sound wave is an example of
platform-independence and that the reverse transformation is the opposite.
And why does he do this? Because he is (like all of us) a creature of the
printed word, and he (again, like all of us) accepts the primacy of the
written word because of its current dominance and its easy portability
across space and time. I feel this myself all the time and cannot shake it
off me no matter how hard I try.

Simply consider this: When we see a poem on the page, that is the poem
itself as far as we are concerned because we accept the textual as the
authentic. When we hear the poem read, we consider that particular aural
experience to be a replication of the original poem, yet is it? Isn¡¯t it
more truly a certain type of translation separable from the original? If we
animated the same words and put them on a computer screen, why would we
assume that that new digital version was still the same poem? If we added
images to the poem and recontextualized it, increasing its visual cotext,
why would we still say it was the same poem? If we created a sculpture out
of this poem, wouldn¡¯t that translation be a different thing (an object
poem) rather than merely an example of the poem on a different platform?
Aren¡¯t all these versions merely different things?

And if we rejected this line of reasoning altogether, how could we argue
that an oral or visual poem reverse-engineered into the identical set of
¡°versions¡± was not itself platform-independent? I see no way to make that
argument, since each incarnation in each of these instances is equally
different in manner from whatever original we begin with. Just as much is
lost and gained through each of these sets of conversions, migrations,
transformations¡ªor whatever we would like to call them. (I use the
terminology of the archival electronic records field here merely because it
is pertinent.)"

In 'porting' a work from one "platform" or medium to another, A to B, say,
the question arises whether B supports the same semantic structures as A.
For instance, if the work on A is sound poetry and the idea is to port it to
print, and the work involves a sudden and blood curdling scream at the top
of one's lungs, we might wonder how to translate that onto the page. But,
alas, symbols on a page do not convey the same thing. To require that sound
poetry be amenable to easy translation onto the page is simply a way of
limiting it to a print-minded mentality that cannot bring itself to any
significant departures from the poetry of print.

Sound poets often do make some version of their work for print (often a
visual poem), but it is rarely the case that in reading/viewing it, without
experiencing the performance or at least a recorded audio version, one could
begin to guess what the audio or performance sounds like -- or means. The
sound and print manifestations, often, are related but different works that,
together, do not mirror one another but create a third work that involves
both.

My own interest for the last several years has been and continues to be
digital poetry. The most interesting work of this nature that I come across
often does not pass the "Blake test". What it means to 'write well', when
you are writing several media and interactive programming--but remain
intensely engaged with language--is a curious matter. Not to say that
approaches from the poetry of print are irrelevant to it--they're not
irrelevant--but there are other, often incompatible semantic structures and
contexts at play. You're dealing with notions of film, writing/the page,
audio, design, interactivity, and there are unspoken, unwritten languages at
play in which the written/visually symbolic letter/word (or utterance) finds
its place. Or fights its way in. Often with unease. Or disease. Broken. But
there is more room for it than in film, say.

That is not the way I approach it. I respond to issues which interest me.

That is simple. That's why the look of a message needs to be change to keep
up the interest. To give an example, blogs were much rarer in the web. Once
their numbers (the choices) drastically increased, the odds of a single blog
getting hits essentially decreased. In my view wikis are part of the attempt to
drum up interest and will be followed by other things.

Interestingly, the progress from lists to blogs to wikis is one towards
compartementalization, speciialization. In wikis, one has even the ability to
"edit" the material, basically erasing opposite, non-consensus views. These
multiple pockets of "consensus" very much against the spirit of debate and community.
On the other hand, they fit very well with the intention of companies to have
increasingly specific information about people, "wiki data bases," grouping
them together, to hit them with "smarter" advertizing.

By implying that the main function of a site like wiki is to arrive at
definitions, you are saying about the internet something like "everything I see on
T.V. news is the truth. How is information on the internet more trustworthy?
The only advantage the internet might have is its greater variety, which at
least your version of whatever wiki is is trying to limit.

Thank you for calling me a Luddite. It must have a comfortable ring to it for
you; is that my definition in your wiki? Here is some thought about hell:
chidren should not play with tools, guns, chainsaws or otherwise. Every advantage
the net offers up -and I admit there are many- is simultaneously a means, a
location which can control us (in essence delienating a public record of our
secret life). If you are not conscious of this painful, historical paradox, I am
afraid one is like a child not ready for the tool with which he/she is
playing.

I believe you. A list facilitates that sort of thought. Not everyone who
watches television (which I don't) turns off their brain; not everyone
who uses a list applies the logic of direct democracy. It is a tendancy
of the technology.

That's a good point. Understand, tricks like that only work on
"consumers" (not a word by which I refer to my own readers, but we were
discussing capitalistic ego supply) who /don't/ understand technology.
No one who knows what a wiki is will be inherently impressed by wiki.

The ability to erase information stored on one's own or one's company's
web site is a part of all web sites. The fact that this ability was
mentioned (and not by me) on this list in regard to wikis does not make
it unique to wikis.

>
> By implying that the main function of a site like wiki is to arrive at

I did not. I pointed out wikipedia as the most successful and celebrated
use of the technology. I then confessed I wasn't a wiki administrator,
and couldn't advise you on all the potential advantages of a wiki, over
other forms of existing technology.

> you are saying about the internet something like "everything I see on

Greater variety, yes, and a far smaller entry fee, for publishers and
authors.

> which at

If the wiki administrator chooses to remove information from his wiki,
he has no more or less power to do so than an HTML web site would allow
him.  Also, wikis have a built-in mechanism for saving deleted material,
unlike straight HTML pages.

To be honest, my good man, I called you a technophobe. I am a
neo-Luddite. You speak as though the comprehension of technology
necessitates a lust for it, that the fear of technology imparts a
greater understanding of it, and that because I wish to discuss
technology accurately, I am unaware of the history of the Industrial and
Information Revolutions. That is not factually accurate. Have I
misunderstood you?

Yours,

we

|||

differences

remediate

experimental

is

||||||Subject: Re: drummer seeks musicians to play wiki
||||||
||||||Hi Bill---
||||||
||||||Thanks for writing--I think the crisis with underfunded schools =
and
||||||artist
||||||and entertainment types are very intertwined.
||||||Obviously, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the "new technology"---
||||||
||||||(for instance, there was that satire in The Onion a few months =
back
|||about
||||||the guy who finally broke down after 10 years and got a cell phone
||||||which he used to call up NPR from his car to decry the "loss of =
public
||||||spaces"---they got it down kinda brilliantly)
||||||
||||||So yes sure I have to avoid the temptation to champion
||||||"primitive" luddite, or whatever else I may invoke as theories
||||||of "cultural decay" and be, uh,
||||||"nostalgic for a time before i was even born"
||||||
||||||For looking at larger issues like the way the car and TV (more so =
than
||||||radio, I'd say--though to some extent TV was an "extension" of the
|||radio)
||||||changed cultural life in America---and how the changes, after a =
brief,
||||||and exciting transitional period, have now become normalized,
||||||and now seeing the web similarly normalized for many teens,
||||||it tends to render obsolete many identity-forming "standards"
||||||a previous generation may still appeal to.
||||||
||||||For instance, in the mass-media of recorded music, there has been,
||||||along with the rise of the CD, the "death of the single," and
||||||the marginalization of the more autonomous (relatively speaking)
||||||"personality DJ" on the radio. The implications of this are too
||||||broad to go into here (and probably of not the most interest to
||||||a poetics list)---but people who grew up accepting these primary
||||||modes of cultural reproduction in that sphere find themselves =
groping
|||to
||||||try to understand what exactly has replaced them (and many are
|||fumbling
||||||around the web, etc).
||||||
||||||Now, if one thinks (however "subjectively") that these older modes
||||||enabled a more vital cultural dialogue---as the baby boomer =
generation
||||||cultural critics are often fond of doing--that the art that was
|||"allowed"
||||||to be more popular "once upon a time" was actually "better"---and =
that
||||||the mode of production enabled that. Not just because one could =
have a
||||||hit
||||||single with raw (CHEAPLY PRODUCED!) garage rock in 1966, but also
|||because
||||||the single was less bulky than an album, or, later, people =
"UPGRADING
||||||THEIR
||||||ALBUM COLLECTIONS to CDS"---to, in effect, reify and rigidify a
|||certain
||||||CANON you might say. Consumers in the 80s/90s became way more
|||encouraged
||||||to "upgrade" their old album collections (bonus tracks were thrown =
in
|||for
||||||the skeptics) than check out newer things. And there was more of a
|||PROFIT
||||||margin for the record companies in doing this. The switch from =
singles
|||to
||||||albums that took place in "pop music" in the 60s also became
||||||progressively
||||||more normalized, even as the "art rock" thing went back to the =
older
|||mode
||||||of an album largely being a few "hits" with a good deal of =
"filler"
|||(as
||||||in
||||||ealry motown albums), but in 1965, you didn't HAVE to get the =
album.
|||By
||||||1995, you did---and so "consumers" tried to subvert this with =
napster
|||and
||||||such.
||||||
||||||Anyway, similarly with schools---basically ever since brown v. =
board
|||of
||||||education allegedly desegrated public schools, there have been
|||attempts
||||||to
||||||de-fund public schools, although it took awhile for this movement =
to
|||gain
||||||steam---the "reagan revolution" "school vouchers" etc. The analogy
|||with
||||||the
||||||"music biz" (above) is only partially explained by racism--
|||Privitization
||||||ends up becoming the bastard child of the Great Society when it =
comes
|||to
||||||"higher education." The FLOWERING of "higher education" in the =
late
|||60s
||||||through the 80s, in which colleges were largely opened up to lower
|||class
||||||whites, women, and "minorities" more than ever before at first, =
like
|||the
||||||so-called DEMOCRATIZATION that pop-top 40 radio allowed around =
that
|||same
||||||time, at first had great liberating potential. But soon, after the
|||late
||||||70s
||||||"student-loan" act (which allowed or maybe even "forced" the =
prices of
||||||colleges to go up), and people with BAs and MAs and even Ph.Ds now
||||||flooded
||||||the "marketplace" and the degrees became devalued (for many, an MA =
in
||||||1990
||||||was somewhat analogous to a highschool degree in 1960)---meaning
|||access
||||||to
||||||the means of cultural production for both became equally limited.
||||||
||||||When I say "cultural malaise" then, I don't mean that there isn't =
as
|||much
||||||GREAT STUFF being produced today, whether intellectually, =
artistically
|||or
||||||in the entertainment industry, but that it does seem, empirically,
|||much
||||||more difficult for people to find it or to be heard as the mass =
media
|||has
||||||a much smaller tolerance for eclecticism and difference than it =
once
|||did.
||||||Conspiracy theories can come in handy here, but of course it's
|||probably
||||||better to not let the question rest with "what went wrong" but =
rather
|||try
||||||to figure out how this can be "subverted" or at least "changed". =
So, I
||||||keep
||||||coming up with quotes like "if a fool persists in his folly" or "I
|||will
||||||never cease from menta fight"---but it can't be purely MENTAL, can =
it?
||||||At least not for me. Like what does the desire, and frankly, NEED, =
to
||||||shake
||||||things up---without losing a sense a fun--mean today? What can it =
mean
||||||today? Working one-on-one, seeking out individuals on, say, =
MYSPACE
|||may
||||||not
||||||be the most efficient way of trying to build a network or =
coalition in
||||||the
||||||absence of vital local culture, or the absence of a "national
|||promotional
||||||campaign" that allegedly understands the proper rules and is too =
often
||||||(whether in the field of books, music, teaching, etc) a form of
||||||censorship
||||||based on credentials and a fear of risk-taking. But it's =
definitely
||||||better
||||||than just sitting at home, or with a few friends at a bar, =
resigning
||||||ourselves to not being heard, which, for me, is ultimately a kind =
of
||||||selfish fear of GIVING--not that I want to go too far into the =
"death
|||or
||||||glory" thing. I mean I like to QUIP and make fun of (almost to the
|||point
||||||of
||||||discreding) say Ezra Pound for saying he lose his center trying to
|||fight
||||||the
||||||world, but the "cultural malaise" of which I speak is ONE with the
|||idea
||||||of living in one of the RICHEST countries in the world and in =
which
||||||people
||||||whose city was destroyed by a hurricane are offered little to no =
help
||||||whatsoever. A Basic helplessness in part because the MEDIATORS =
have
|||once
||||||again become more like WALLS than BRIDGES---despite some hopes =
after
|||the
||||||salves were "freed" that there could be "social progress."
||||||
||||||It's precisely the myth of "social progress" that has engendered =
the
||||||reversion! Unfortunately, the web, like "upward mobility" promised =
by
||||||"white
||||||collar" jobs (and the myth of college), as well as the =
"revolutions"
|||in
||||||the
||||||mode of productions in the entertainment industry, has based so =
much
|||of
||||||its
||||||"aura" on such a myth of social progress, and even if it's =
ULTIMATELY
|||not
||||||any worse than previous modes, it certaintly isn't SOCIAL =
progress, at
||||||least
||||||not in and of itself. A tool perhaps, yes---but at what cost?
||||||

Reading just the latest response to this series of messages, I find myself asking if this poet or anyone else on this series of responses is familiar with the once-famous classical song by Reynaldo Hahn entitled: "Si Mes Vers Avaient Des Ailes", which translates either as "If my words had wings" or "If my verses had wings.".

|||
|||Dear Chris
|||
|||Greetings
|||
|||I'm still trying to work out how to tune my wiki.
|||
|||The trend in music sale and distribution is by download of single songs
|||from
|||the internet (for payment) and the concept of 'the album' has gone out
|||the
|||door. Young people download as many songs as they can afford or store on
|||theit mobile music players. Wouldn't that signal the death of the cd and
|||the
|||rise of the single again?
|||
|||Thanks for your analysis of the late 60s and 70s in the usa, it seems we
|||share many similarities in australia, but lag behind in so-called
|||education
|||reforms like paying for your degree after you've finished(1993),
|||privatisation of tertiary education, etc..
|||
|||I still don't have a mobile phone, but i am not a luddite, i have chosen
|||not
|||to be dependent on that particular communication device. I do however
|||spend
|||several hours a day on-line and emailing.
|||
|||I have embraced the internet as a creative tool and not a technology to
|||replace other technologies. I don't see a binary opposition old vs new
|||technology at all. Most binary oppositions can be shown to be differences
|||in
|||degree rather than kind anyway. The internet is not a place to remediate
|||old
|||media, although it is very good for this purpose, it is an experimental
|||space characterised by collaborative projects(like wiki),
|||interconnectivity,
|||greater user participation(interactivity), and as a polysemiotic system
|||of
|||reading and writing using all kinds of media elements as textons. Past
|||arguments of which semiotic system best describes the way the world is
|||'read' have set up oppositions text/image, text/music, music/image etc.
|||the
|||reality is that we use all kinds of systems to 'read' the world and the
|||internet and multimedia software is allowing that kind of new media
|||writing/composing for the medium of the web.
|||John cale and lou read in 'songs for drella' a tribute album for andy
|||warhol
|||wrote,
|||"he's driving a gypsy caravan but he's thinking like a truck"
|||
|||the internet for me is a gypsy caravan and too many people just drive it
|||like a truck.

||||||Subject: Re: drummer seeks musicians to play wiki
||||||
||||||Hi Bill---
||||||
||||||Thanks for writing--I think the crisis with underfunded schools and
||||||artist
||||||and entertainment types are very intertwined.
||||||Obviously, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the "new technology"---
||||||
||||||(for instance, there was that satire in The Onion a few months back
|||about
||||||the guy who finally broke down after 10 years and got a cell phone
||||||which he used to call up NPR from his car to decry the "loss of public
||||||spaces"---they got it down kinda brilliantly)
||||||
||||||So yes sure I have to avoid the temptation to champion
||||||"primitive" luddite, or whatever else I may invoke as theories
||||||of "cultural decay" and be, uh,
||||||"nostalgic for a time before i was even born"
||||||
||||||For looking at larger issues like the way the car and TV (more so than
||||||radio, I'd say--though to some extent TV was an "extension" of the
|||radio)
||||||changed cultural life in America---and how the changes, after a brief,
||||||and exciting transitional period, have now become normalized,
||||||and now seeing the web similarly normalized for many teens,
||||||it tends to render obsolete many identity-forming "standards"
||||||a previous generation may still appeal to.
||||||
||||||For instance, in the mass-media of recorded music, there has been,
||||||along with the rise of the CD, the "death of the single," and
||||||the marginalization of the more autonomous (relatively speaking)
||||||"personality DJ" on the radio. The implications of this are too
||||||broad to go into here (and probably of not the most interest to
||||||a poetics list)---but people who grew up accepting these primary
||||||modes of cultural reproduction in that sphere find themselves groping
|||to
||||||try to understand what exactly has replaced them (and many are
|||fumbling
||||||around the web, etc).
||||||
||||||Now, if one thinks (however "subjectively") that these older modes
||||||enabled a more vital cultural dialogue---as the baby boomer generation
||||||cultural critics are often fond of doing--that the art that was
|||"allowed"
||||||to be more popular "once upon a time" was actually "better"---and that
||||||the mode of production enabled that. Not just because one could have a
||||||hit
||||||single with raw (CHEAPLY PRODUCED!) garage rock in 1966, but also
|||because
||||||the single was less bulky than an album, or, later, people "UPGRADING
||||||THEIR
||||||ALBUM COLLECTIONS to CDS"---to, in effect, reify and rigidify a
|||certain
||||||CANON you might say. Consumers in the 80s/90s became way more
|||encouraged
||||||to "upgrade" their old album collections (bonus tracks were thrown in
|||for
||||||the skeptics) than check out newer things. And there was more of a
|||PROFIT
||||||margin for the record companies in doing this. The switch from singles
|||to
||||||albums that took place in "pop music" in the 60s also became
||||||progressively
||||||more normalized, even as the "art rock" thing went back to the older
|||mode
||||||of an album largely being a few "hits" with a good deal of "filler"
|||(as
||||||in
||||||ealry motown albums), but in 1965, you didn't HAVE to get the album.
|||By
||||||1995, you did---and so "consumers" tried to subvert this with napster
|||and
||||||such.
||||||
||||||Anyway, similarly with schools---basically ever since brown v. board
|||of
||||||education allegedly desegrated public schools, there have been
|||attempts
||||||to
||||||de-fund public schools, although it took awhile for this movement to
|||gain
||||||steam---the "reagan revolution" "school vouchers" etc. The analogy
|||with
||||||the
||||||"music biz" (above) is only partially explained by racism--
|||Privitization
||||||ends up becoming the bastard child of the Great Society when it comes
|||to
||||||"higher education." The FLOWERING of "higher education" in the late
|||60s
||||||through the 80s, in which colleges were largely opened up to lower
|||class
||||||whites, women, and "minorities" more than ever before at first, like
|||the
||||||so-called DEMOCRATIZATION that pop-top 40 radio allowed around that
|||same
||||||time, at first had great liberating potential. But soon, after the
|||late
||||||70s
||||||"student-loan" act (which allowed or maybe even "forced" the prices of
||||||colleges to go up), and people with BAs and MAs and even Ph.Ds now
||||||flooded
||||||the "marketplace" and the degrees became devalued (for many, an MA in
||||||1990
||||||was somewhat analogous to a highschool degree in 1960)---meaning
|||access
||||||to
||||||the means of cultural production for both became equally limited.
||||||
||||||When I say "cultural malaise" then, I don't mean that there isn't as
|||much
||||||GREAT STUFF being produced today, whether intellectually, artistically
|||or
||||||in the entertainment industry, but that it does seem, empirically,
|||much
||||||more difficult for people to find it or to be heard as the mass media
|||has
||||||a much smaller tolerance for eclecticism and difference than it once
|||did.
||||||Conspiracy theories can come in handy here, but of course it's
|||probably
||||||better to not let the question rest with "what went wrong" but rather
|||try
||||||to figure out how this can be "subverted" or at least "changed". So, I
||||||keep
||||||coming up with quotes like "if a fool persists in his folly" or "I
|||will
||||||never cease from menta fight"---but it can't be purely MENTAL, can it?
||||||At least not for me. Like what does the desire, and frankly, NEED, to
||||||shake
||||||things up---without losing a sense a fun--mean today? What can it mean
||||||today? Working one-on-one, seeking out individuals on, say, MYSPACE
|||may
||||||not
||||||be the most efficient way of trying to build a network or coalition in
||||||the
||||||absence of vital local culture, or the absence of a "national
|||promotional
||||||campaign" that allegedly understands the proper rules and is too often
||||||(whether in the field of books, music, teaching, etc) a form of
||||||censorship
||||||based on credentials and a fear of risk-taking. But it's definitely
||||||better
||||||than just sitting at home, or with a few friends at a bar, resigning
||||||ourselves to not being heard, which, for me, is ultimately a kind of
||||||selfish fear of GIVING--not that I want to go too far into the "death
|||or
||||||glory" thing. I mean I like to QUIP and make fun of (almost to the
|||point
||||||of
||||||discreding) say Ezra Pound for saying he lose his center trying to
|||fight
||||||the
||||||world, but the "cultural malaise" of which I speak is ONE with the
|||idea
||||||of living in one of the RICHEST countries in the world and in which
||||||people
||||||whose city was destroyed by a hurricane are offered little to no help
||||||whatsoever. A Basic helplessness in part because the MEDIATORS have
|||once
||||||again become more like WALLS than BRIDGES---despite some hopes after
|||the
||||||salves were "freed" that there could be "social progress."
||||||
||||||It's precisely the myth of "social progress" that has engendered the
||||||reversion! Unfortunately, the web, like "upward mobility" promised by
||||||"white
||||||collar" jobs (and the myth of college), as well as the "revolutions"
|||in
||||||the
||||||mode of productions in the entertainment industry, has based so much
|||of
||||||its
||||||"aura" on such a myth of social progress, and even if it's ULTIMATELY
|||not
||||||any worse than previous modes, it certaintly isn't SOCIAL progress, at
||||||least
||||||not in and of itself. A tool perhaps, yes---but at what cost?

Yes, a repellant day. And one we must never
allow ourselves to forget, since it seems so to
have turned solely on the polls.

Tonight we are all failing to meet the challenge to
ourselves as a species to find ways of dealing
with our others that would manifest intelligence
and compassion rather than power and vengeance.

... but then it should come as no surprise...

yesterday, the celebrity real estate column in the LA times had a notice =
of
the sale of the house built on the lot where OJ Simpson's house on
Rockingham once stood (even all the original topsoil was removed)...

the same LA times had a story of the beating death of a schizophrenic =
man
arrested on gun possession charges who was put in central lock up with
murderers; they thought he was a "snitch"

while I oppose the death penalty except in the case of sex murderer =
serial
killers, and it is soo rarely applied to them, I wonder if tookie's case
would have been improved if he had, in these past weeks, started to
undermine the power of the gangs in prison, or the culture of refusing =
to
testify -- probably not, but wouldn't that have been grand? I understand
that would be only substituting one violent and unfair system for =
another,
neither affecting me personally

but I've always hated the deadly side of the concept behind the =
"tattletale"
playground taunt

Catherine:

Confused here: Having only knowledge of New York State's death row
structure, where inmates are "locked down" in isolated cells, especially
in the narrow weeks leading up to execution (we've yet to have one here),
how could Williams have had the contact to bring about your idea? Yes,
there is a kind of telegraph even in the darkest of holes, yet... yet...?

Also, after all... aren't the gangs within an unofficial creation of the
official structure? A distant cousin, say, of how Ralph Reed/Karl Rove
handed the South (and all its alignment "axis states") to our current
president? In many, many prisons the gangs run the place at the tacit
behest of those with the keys. No?

gangs in prison are an extension of the gangs on the streets; I suppose one
could argue that they are more powerful than the system, in that the
executions gang leadership orders in prison can't be stayed

they undermine the system by determining who testifies to what in court

and Tookie has had the ears of any number of celebs for several weeks now,
through his lawyers

All best,
Catherine

it's worth reading the gov's statement on why he won't give Tookie
Williams clemency.
Among other bizarre paragraphs is one in which he "close reads" the list
of persons to whom
Williams dedicated one of his books.  The list begins with Nelson
Mandela, but Gov. S declares
that because the book is also dedicated to George Jackson, he has not
adequately "atoned."  Elsewhere
he writes that, if violence had declined in LA, that would have shown
that Williams's books were
effective, but because there is still violence...

Leave close reading to the professionals, Governor...

I know it is easy for someone not in power to suggest to one who is in in a
position of even a small amount of power  to abdicate that power. But I do
wish that Al Young - the current poet laureate of the State of California
would quit in protest against the Governor's refusal to grant clemency.
Al - who I have known to be a very decent guy in other situations (as well
as quite serious about the possibility of his current position, particularly
for supporting young and student writers) just might up and leave. I suspect
the whole thing is quite troubling for him - let alone many of us.

Re Susan's report here: Does the Governor want us to assume that this
execution will lead to a decline in violence in Los Angeles and elsewhere?
The analysis strikes me as totally nuts.

Sorrowfully,

Stephen Vincent

Dear Friends:

Rattapallax produced film "Sound Barrier" has recently
won some big awards.

The Jury of the Filmcritica Award "Bastone Bianco" of
the 23rd Torino Film Festival was given to SOUND
BARRIER by Amir Naderi.

Citation: For the extreme experimentation with which
he breaks down the barrier between sound, sight and
touch, in a form which touches the madness of Herzog
and the tragic utopia of the story by Sokurov.

Amir Naderi was given the Critics Award (Roberto
Rossellini prize) and Charlie Wilson won the Best
Actor award at the Roma Film Festival.

Recent Festival showings:
Torino Film Festival, Roma Film Festival, Vancouver
International Film Festival & Tokyo Filmex

Exhilarating and exhausting — with a finale that is
quite literally an epiphany. — Village Voice

Help save free English as Second Language, Literacy, &
GED classes at the Chicago City Colleges!!!

Adult Education is the largest program at the City
Colleges of Chicago (CCC). We provide **FREE** classes
for more than 50,000 immigrant and working students at
100 locations across Chicago every year
(http://www.ccc.edu/co/mainadult.shtml).

Recently, the district office has **REDUCED** its
Adult Education budget at each of the CCC campuses by
15.34% or $2 million total.  Hundreds of students and
many teachers have had their classes cut.  The CCC
administrators are now putting too many students into
the remaining classes and hurting the future of these
classes.

Yet -- CCC received a $1 million (3%) increase in
funding from the Illinois Community College Board for
its Adult Education Program for this year, bringing
the total amount it receives for Adult Education
Program to $30.4 million. And, CCC has net assets of
over $400 million, had a budget surplus last year of
$76.9 million and projects a budget surplus of $69
million for this year.

AFSCME Local 3506, (the part-time teachers' union
http://www.afscme.org/about/index.html), is organizing
a letter writing campaign to support Chicago's Adult
Education Program.  Please read the sample letter
posted below and **WRITE A LETTER OR EMAIL!!!**

Got more ideas?  Want more information?
Call the teachers’ union 312-641-0431 or email us at
afscmelocal3506 @ sbcglobal.net
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**SAMPLE LETTER**

Dear Sir:

I am writing to ask that you fully fund and support
Adult Education at the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC).
 More than 40% of CPS students drop out of high
school, 38% of immigrants in Illinois live at or near
poverty, and 25% of all Illinois residents are barely
able to read at functional levels of literacy. These
incredible facts mandate that there should be a
strong, accessible, and quality Adult Education
Program. Without such, these individuals would be left
with few options for bettering their lives.

Since it is CCC’s stated mission to, “be the leader
among educational institutions in the delivery of
quality academic and work force development programs
that enhance the quality of life for Chicago’s diverse
communities,” you should stop the unnecessary cuts to
the adult education program.

The current and previous cuts that CCC has made are
harmful to students because they reduce programmatic
support, decrease the number and availability of
classes and overcrowd the remaining classes. CCC
received more than $30 million this year for adult
education, and it projects a $69 million all funds
surplus for the fiscal year. Cutting classes and
increasing class sizes is no way to provide quality
education and doesn’t promote good leadership.

Subject:      Rivers Cuomo on Vipassana Meditation and Creativity
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Weezer's front man Rivers Cuomo reached a point in his life a few years
ago where he came face to face with the misery all of us spend our days
running from -- and he realized he needed to do something about it. He
was given a volume of Hafiz's poetry and began to think about
meditation, the life of love, God, and a way out of suffering.

He took time off from the band and from Harvard -- and eventually found
vipassana meditation. Here's what he writes about vipassana:


 >> Renunciation
 >>
 >> In February of 2003, Rick gave me a copy of Daniel Ladinsky’s
 >> translation of Hafiz’s poetry, The Gift.  After overcoming my initial
 >> aversion to all things spiritual, I decided to read some of the book
 >> because I trusted Rick so much.  Henry Mindlin, in his introduction to
 >> the book, says:
 >>
 >> Hafiz wrote hundreds of ghazals [or love songs], finding ways to bring
 >> new depth and meaning to the lyrics without losing the accustomed
 >> association of a love song…He explored different forms and levels of
 >> love:  his delight in nature’s beauty, his romantic courtship of that
 >> ideal unattainable girl, his sweet affection for his wife, his tender
 >> feelings for his child…his relationship with his teacher and his
 >> adoration of God.
 >>
 >> I was struck by the connection between all these different forms of
 >> love.  I recognized that the feeling of sublime ecstasy I once got from
 >> music was just one more of these forms of love.
 >>
 >> I had an epiphany:  if the feeling these mystics get in union with
their
 >> God is analogous to the feeling I used to get in union with my music,
 >> then their teachings for how to achieve their union should likewise
 >> serve to instruct me how to achieve my union.  A whole world of
 >> spiritual teachings therefore opened up to me for the first time since,
 >> as a child, I had decided that I was an “atheist”.  I now read these
 >> spiritual teachings as coded instructions for how to connect with my
 >> musical creativity.  For example, when Hafiz says, “Self-Effacement is
 >> the emerald dagger you need to plunge deep into yourself upon this path
 >> to …God”, I read it as “Self-Effacement is the emerald dagger you need
 >> to plunge deep into yourself upon this path to Musical Creativity.”
 >> Like this, I just replaced the word God wherever I saw it.   I had
 >> discovered a new path which I believed was what I had been waiting for.
 >>
 >> I eagerly studied a wide variety of traditions including the mystical
 >> poetry of Hafiz, Rumi, and Kabir, contemporary spiritual teachers, and
 >> ancient texts such as the Tao Te Ching.  In accord with my
understanding
 >> of these teachings, I abruptly dropped all of my business
 >> responsibilities and hard-won power, and isolated myself once again.  I
 >> fasted and lost fifteen percent of my weight.  I took a vow of complete
 >> celibacy.  I gave away or sold most of my possessions, my house, and my
 >> car and lived in an empty apartment next to Rick’s house for the
rest of
 >> the year.  I settled outstanding lawsuits and reconciled myself with
 >> enemies.  I apologized to many people.   I volunteered six days a week
 >> at Project Angel Food in Hollywood, preparing meals for people with HIV.
 >>
 >> Balance
 >> Thus, my life made another extreme swing, as it has many times since I
 >> was a teenager.  I have been sometimes a tyrant, sometimes the most
 >> frustratingly passive person you have ever met, sometimes a socialite,
 >> sometimes a hermit, sometimes a rock star, sometimes a student.  I have
 >> had little inner stability.
 >>
 >> During this latest swing towards spirituality, however, I started a
 >> practice which may help me achieve some balance:  meditation.  Rick
 >> Rubin sent me some books on the subject but, at first, I would not read
 >> them.  I thought that meditation would rob me of the angst that I
 >> believed was essential for my connection to music.  All the crazy
 >> experiments I have tried in my life have always been an effort to
 >> improve, maintain, or recover that connection.   Eventually, however,
 >> desperate for answers, I read the first three chapters of one of the
 >> books, Ken Mcleod’s guide to meditation, Wake Up to Your Life.   His
 >> words hit me like a lightning bolt.  I realized that, in a sense, I had
 >> been wrong all these years in trying to connect to my creativity by
 >> violent means, for example, by mining my adolescent anger for “Say it
 >> Ain’t So”, crucifying my leg for Pinkerton, or consuming Tequila and
 >> Ritalin for “Hash Pipe”.  Mcleod says:
 >>
 >> These devices [such as the ones above] do not work in the long run
 >> because they draw on our system’s energy to generate a peak
experience.
 >> Peak experiences cannot be maintained, and when they pass, the
 >> habituated patterns and the underlying sense of separation remain
 >> intact. (xi)
 >>
 >> Mcleod, and other sources I began reading, showed me a new way to
work.
 >> Instead of generating peak experiences for inspiration, I could
 >> strengthen my power of concentration through meditation so that I could
 >> get more and more inspiration from weaker and weaker experiences.  Not
 >> only that, but the practice would make my life better, and make better
 >> the lives of those that have to live with me.  I started to meditate.
 >>
 >> The technique I was drawn to is called Vipassana.  It is taught around
 >> the world at over one hundred centers and temporary camps.  (Go to
 >> www.dhamma.org for more information.)  I started the practice fourteen
 >> months ago, attending seven ten-day courses and serving as a volunteer
 >> at two.  Since then, I have found that the areas of tension in my
 >> mind—the fear, the anger, the sadness, the craving—are slowly melting
 >> away.  I am left with a more pristine mind, more sharp and sensitive
 >> than I previously imagined possible.  I feel more calm and stable.  My
 >> concentration and capacity to work have increased greatly.  I feel like
 >> I am finally much closer to reaching my potential.
 >>
 >> I now live in a small but comfortable apartment.  I feed myself
 >> adequately.  I took a class at USC this spring, “The History of
Literary
 >> Criticism”, and enjoyed it very much.  I take private lessons in music
 >> composition once a week from Bruce Reich, a professor at UCLA.  I still
 >> volunteer, once a week, now at the West Hollywood Food Coalition,
 >> feeding homeless or otherwise disadvantaged people.  But most pleasing
 >> to me is that, month by month, I have watched my creative flexibility
 >> returning.  The music I have created over the last six months has
 >> brought me much enjoyment.
 >>
 >> I am returning to Harvard in the fall.  Other than that, I am wide open
 >> to whatever else comes my way…

Hi everyone,

I wanted to give you a preliminary heads up about a new Creative Writing
program that I'll be directing at Rhode Island School of Design.  It's a summer
institute with an eight class curriculum that emphasizes the positive impact
that the visual arts and critical theory can have on creative writers and their
work. Four of the classes will be intensive three-week classes offered for full
graduate or undergraduate credit (though they can also be taken as non-
credit classes). The other four will be weekend seminars running from 9-3 on
Saturday and Sunday and taught by some seriously dynamic people.  The
Institute will run from June 24th to August 4th.  RISD is equipped to provide
room and board during this time for out of town students.  And Rhode Island
is beachy and gorgeous in the summertime!

I hope some of you will be interested in enrolling in these classes.  But in
addition, if you are teaching creative writing and are meeting with your
students one last time before the semester ends, could you pass this
information along to them?

A more formal marketing campaign will begin after the holliday break -- if
any of you would like flyers or posters or postcards to pass along to students
or friends contact me at mmagee@risd.edu.

I've copied the description and course listings below.  Have a look!

Yours,

Michael Magee

INSTITUTE FOR POETIC ARTS AND CRITICAL THEORY (IPACT)
At Rhode Island School of Design

A New Path for Creative Writers…

RISD’s Institute for Poetic Arts and Critical Theory (IPACT) provides a new
path for creative writers looking to expand their intellectual horizons.  The
eight-class curriculum (four three-week credit classes for undergraduate and
graduate students and four intensive non-credit weekend seminars)
emphasizes the positive impact that the visual arts and critical theory can
have on creative writers and their work.  Classes will be taught by RISD’s
outstanding, nationally recognized creative writing professors as well as by
major writers in the world of poetry and the visual arts.  Students will have a
range of opportunities to present their own work for feedback.  In addition
the curriculum is designed to encourage students to take advantage of the
wealth of poetry and visual art resources in Providence -- including the
internationally acclaimed RISD Museum; the inexhaustible poetry archive in
the Harris Collection at the John Hay Library at Brown University; and the
expanded summer schedule of the Downcity Poetry Series in downtown
Providence (where students will have an opportunity to participate in open
mic readings alongside the area’s most well-known poets).

With a special attentiveness, the IPACT curriculum fosters communication
across the great divide of artistic medium.  Its courses seek to aid
participants in involving themselves fully in a multi-disciplinary world of art-
making and art-welcoming -- a world where creative writers and visual
artists collaboratively propose what words and forms the future will hold.

ADVANCED SEMINARS

The Poet as Art Critic
Peter Schjeldahl
Peter Schjeldahl is the art critic of The New Yorker and, previously, of the
Village Voice.  He is also a poet with several books to his credit and roots in
the legendary “New York School.”  Schjeldahl will lecture on “the poet as art
critic” both in the heyday of poet-art critics such as Frank O’Hara and John
Ashbery and in the present moment, all in the context of a wide-ranging
discussion of art and art criticism, past and present.
June 24-25
Tuition: $395

Poetry, Art, Philosophy
Ann Lauterbach
Ann Lauterbach is Ruth and David Schwab III Professor of Language and
Literature at Bard College. A recipient of major fellowships from the
Guggenheim Foundation, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and the John D. and
Catherine C. MacArthur Foundation, she has published six collections of
poetry, including If in Time: Selected Poems 1975-2000.  Lauterbach has also
contributed to numerous artists’ catalogues as well as to Art in America. Here
she will lead a two-day seminar on the reciprocal pleasures of poetry, art and
philosophy.
July 1-2
Tuition: $295



Creative Art Criticism
Lynne Tillman
Lynne Tillman is the author of four novels, two collections of short stories,
one collection of essays and two nonfiction books. A National Book Critics
Circle Award finalist, she has collaborated often with artists and writes
regularly on art andculture.  Here she will be discussing he own work and the
possibilities of “creative art criticism.”  In addition she will invite visual art
students enrolled in the class to present slides of their work in conjunction
with their artist’s statements for critique as part of a wide-ranging discussion
of how to effectively talk about one’s own artwork in various contexts.
July 8-9
Tuition: $295


The Poet’s Artist Book
Steve Clay
Steve Clay, editor of the prestigious publishing house for artist-poet
collaborations, Granary Books, and author of the acclaimed history, A Secret
Location on the Lower East Side: Adventures in Writing, 1960-1980, will teach
this three day seminar on poet-artist collaborations, how to create them and
how to publish them.  The seminar will include a historical overview as well as
a survey of current work.  Students may present their own projects or take a
critical approach to the subject.
July 22-23
Tuition: $295

3 CREDIT CLASSES

Poetry and Art as Democratic Experience
Michael Magee
What is the relationship, if any, between “democracy” as a social or political
praxis and “democracy” as it pertains to the creation and reception of art?
This will be the motivating question of our class. Can art have a “democratic
form”? Would such a form be a mere byproduct of democratic social
structures; would it in fact inspirit those structures; or would the two be
mutually exclusive; what would a democratic form look like anyway?  To help
answer these questions we’ll be reading deeply in the philosophical tradition
known as Pragmatism while examining a host of possible examples of
“democratic form” in visual art, film, literature and music.
June 26-July 14, MTThF
Tuition: $1,650
3 Credits

Poetry & Audience
Mairead Byrne
This course invites poets to consider audience as a vital element of writing.
We will look at found poetry, stand-up, poetry of resistance, “identity-based”
poetry, and occasional poetry to see what we can learn.  We will exploit
contemporary audience opportunities, e.g., blogs, innovative publication of
all kinds, open mikes, and the writing workshop itself.  Texts may include
poems by Alan Dugan, Langston Hughes, Charles Reznikoff, Ntozake Shange;
as well as Charles Harper Webb’s Stand Up Poetry; and these specific poems:
Anna Akhmatova’s “Requiem”; Amiri Baraka’s “SOS,”  “Black Art” and
“Somebody Blew Up America”;  Paul Celan’s “Todesfuge”; and Robert Frost’s
“The Road Not Taken.”  We will write, read, and publish poems.
June 26-July 14, MTThF
Tuition: $1,650
3 Credits

Writing In/As Performance
Wendy Walters
For centuries, poetry, song and theatre have been acknowledged as deeply
connected forms of expression.  Recently, spoken word forms and
performance art have inspired popular audiences and reminded us how
valuable it is to hear new work aloud.   In this workshop, we explore the
history of writing forms associated with music and theatre and write new
works that are specifically designed for performance in a variety of media.
We also consider how the act of writing is a type of performance in its own
right and how both reading and writing can occupy, inform and shape time
and space.
July 17-August 4, MTThF
Tuition: $1,650
3 Credits


Jack Kerouac’s New England
Michael Gizzi
Robert Frost has secured a hard-earned and perhaps unalterable reputation
as the poet of New England. But the Frostian mystique and ouvre has perhaps
obscured the deep roots in New England soil of two of America’s greatest
poets, Jack Kerouac and Robert Creeley.  Poet Michael Gizzi is a native New
Englander, former tree surgeon and himself one of the great literary heirs to
Kerouac and Creeley (with whom Gizzi had a close friendship).  His class will
explore what is to be gained by reading these two essential poets as New
England writers and will use RISD as the ideal site to reconsider the notion of
a New England avant-garde.

Dear Friends,
Guilt for the crime committed in the death of Mr. Williams lies not on =
Arnold's shoulders nor with the team of lawyers who are actually the =
folks responsible for writing the "Decision"  carrying the governor's =
signature.  Fault lies rather with a system which: A. Authorizes the =
death penalty in capital offense cases and then B. Disregards its own =
rulings by failing to carry out death sentences in a non- "cruel and =
inhuman" length of time.  That guilt, friends, falls squarely upon the =
shoulders of the majority of the citizens of the golden state of =
California...shame on them!=20

Mr. Williams spent two and a half decades in the system.  Shame on the =
state of California lawmakers for allowing that to happen!  If one is to =
allow the death penalty as a just punishment, and we needn't debate that =
issue here, for CA does, rightly or wrongly, in fact allow it, then one =
must too have the courage of its convictions to carry out that =
punishment in a swift and merciful manner.  CA failed to abide by that =
or any similar yardstick.  Again, Shame on decades of the legislative =
and executive branches for their failures!  And the governator's =
decision travesty pre-dates the governator's term by those decades. =20

Time, we are told, heals all wounds.  Yet it apparently doesn't heal =
wounds against the state of CA, for the system...both in the state =
courts and in the office of the governor...focus not on any healing or =
change, aka rehabilitation, in the life of Mr. Williams.  Rather they =
ignore his character development and focus on the sins of his past, and =
in the case of the reference to George Jackson et alles, on the past =
sins of others.  How remarkably un-Christian of them.=20

I don't know about the rest of you, but I for one would hate to have to =
stand up and be held accountable today for the sins of my past.  True, =
my sins don't include murder or robbery, nor do they include involvement =
in any form of 'gang' lifestyle or active support of subversive =
activities.  But they are none the less sins of my past for which I am =
neither proud of having committed, nor willing to discuss publicly.  =
More to the point, I am not today the person who committed the =
infractions of which I speak.  And neither was Mr. Williams yesterday =
the same person he had been twenty-six years ago.  Pity, the power =
structure failed to acknowledge that fact of Mr. William's life.=20

To Mr. Williams, I offer only the words of Lord Tennyson:  Frater, Ave =
Atque Vale. =20

Perhaps his death will mark the beginnings of new debates on the CA =
Correctional Facilities, and more vigorous debate on the necessity of =
state authorized executions in capital offenses. Are we really better =
people for having taken the life of another person? =20

Pardon me for naively hoping for some good to come of this state =
endorsed evil.

And I leave you with this confession:

San Remo '59

I lured gay men
in my youth
truth is
I enjoyed the deeds;
better yet
I languish
the thought=20
I no longer need
such sustenance...

Yes, of course! I'm sorry Catherine!

The reader will note that as my posts move later and later into the night I become increasingly less concise, attention to detail decreases at a pace conistent with the forward movement of the clock. My apologies!

But a good a chance as any to mention that Catherine Daly's "Secret Kitty" will be available in a number of different formats -- first, in numerous EBOOK formats for any platform: Adobe Reader, Microsoft Reader, Mobipocket and Palm.

And, most interestingly, as print-on-demand.

While I think that a lot of small presses see POD as "the future", it becomes exceedingly difficult to get there. In fact, most print houses aren't capable of PODing many poetry texts.

Indeed, the typography, pagination, lineation, etc. make it difficult to easily and affordably produce a book through print on demand. In fact, the margin on POD books is so low that most printers wont touch poetry texts, as any copy that is not digital ready nullifies their return on time and effort.

Like all our books at Ahadada, the design for "Secret Kitty" has/will be done in-house, allowing us to produce a book that we're collectively happy with. And unlike other POD houses, our relationship with our service provider will allow us to serve up bound review copies in the new year, as well.

Warmest,
Daniel Sendecki

Hi Steve, Could you bring the five new copies of my book to Tsaurah's book party?  I expect to come to that.  Also, if you have them on you on January 1st, I could get them from you at the Poetry Project or at the alternative reading?  If either of these suggestions is inconvenient, could you let me know and we can make another arrangement?

Lowell, Mass. arts contributor Ibrahima "Alpha" Diallo was granted bail today and is, for now, out of jail. A 12/3 benefit for Alpha raised $8,000, which is paying for an immigration attorney. The judge overseeing Alpha's case was especially impressed with the broad support for Alpha in Lowell. 200 hunded attended the 12/3 fundraiser. Several dozen more filed affidavits on his behalf and attended hearings. Thanks very much to all who wrote in support of the effort.

bios:

*Dan Fishback

Raised on a steady diet of showtunes and secular Jewish leftism, Dan
Fishback was destined to be gay and loud. In 2003, he moved to New York
City, where he promptly became a fixture in the legendary Anti-Folk
community. As half of the indie-pop duo Cheese On Bread, Dan saturated the
Lower East Side with his signature blend of coy spunk and fierce progressiv=
e
ideology. It was his solo work, however, that established him as more than =
a
girly-voiced pop singer.

Hailed by Next Magazine as an "anti-folk genius," Dan's songs of frustratio=
n
and fear provided a welcome change to the vacuous vamping found in most
"queer art." His performance art, too, has attracted the attention of
intellectual young homos thirsty for thoughtful discourse. Ironic without
being nihilistic, passionate without being annoying, Dan writes outside of
and against consumerist mainstream gay culture.

His debut album, SWEET CHASTITY, is a frantic, schizophrenic exploration of
virginity in a culture that commodifies the human body. From the twisted
electro-pulse of the title track to the Carpenters-esque croon of "Kiss and
Tell," SWEET CHASTITY blends at least a dozen musical genres into an
anti-pop mission statement of bitter wit and seething optimism.

You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll break up with your boyfriend.

*Randi Russo

Mixing indie rock, New York garage rock, and singer/songwriter
sensibilities, Randi Russo has drawn comparisons to fellow New Yorkers Patt=
i
Smith, the Velvet Underground, and Sonic Youth for her chaotic and pensive
songwriting.

Growing up in Long Island, Russo briefly flirted with the violin, piano, an=
d
amateur turntable scratching until her early adolescence. Concentrating on
visual arts in her teens, she eventually went on to study painting in St.
Louis, where she began to fully explore the indie rock, grunge, and punk of
the early '90s while working at a college radio station. Purchasing an
electric guitar at the age of 19, the left-handed Russo found playing
right-handed unsatisfactory, eventually playing left-handed but keeping the
instrument strung the same as if it were being played right-handed. This
technique created a distinctive form of chording and riffing, and Russo soo=
n
formed her first band with a bassist and a percussionist under the guise of
Raizel. The trio recorded one single but disbanded in 1996, leaving Russo t=
o
hone her craft in relative seclusion until she emerged as a solo artist
following her return to New York City in 1999.

After about a year on the solo circuit, Russo formed a band and recorded an
admittedly chaotic live EP that captured only their second show with Live a=
t
CBGB's 313 Gallery. Following being approached by Olive Juice Records, Russ=
o
entered the studio to record her debut, 2001's intensely focused Solar
Bipolar. Although it was released at roughly the same time other New York
garage-influenced bands were again rising to prominence, Russo and her band
stood out from the pack as the vehicle of a tough-minded female
singer/songwriter and successfully avoided being categorized as a bandwagon
jumper. -- The All Music Guide

*Dream Bitches

dream bitches (pl. n): Yoko Kikuchi and Ann Zakaluk (oftentimes with an
extended family) tinker with the boundaries of what it means to be friends,
take trips, have boyfriends and lead parallel lives, while dreaming up a
landscape of densely crafted lyrics, rock guitars, and smart harmonies.

*The Domestics

During a brief stint as an A&R assistant, Alina Moscovitz (ex-Bionic Finger=
)
spent her days listening to piles of less-than-stellar demos. She decided
she could do better, so she left the corporate world and returned to
songwriting. She then hooked up with music supervisor and drummer Eric Shaw
(fresh from the break-up of Conquistador which featured Sam Endicott of The
Bravery). They soon lured Evan Silverman (ex-Rosenbergs) away from his jazz
bass lessons in Paris and gigs at the Rainbow Room back to the world of
rock. All that was missing now was crazy lead guitar energy. Thankfully,
they found it in playwright Todd Carlstrom who was last seen writing in
blank verse about women giving birth to rabbits. Finally, The Domestics
line-up was complete.

As a quartet, The Domestics morphed into a potent combination of blazing
pop-punk energy, sickeningly catchy hooks, and lyrics that have a sharp wit
and intelligence seldom heard inside of a three-minute song. If Debbie Harr=
y
shoved her way onstage during a Green Day show, the result might sound
something like this.

Besides constantly playing live shows, the Brooklyn-based band wrote the
closing credits song, "Girl I Never Kissed" for the film The D Word,
"Anorexic Love Song" appears on the X-Girls DVD and "Fire Hazard" was
included in the "Say It Don't Spray It" compilation CD packaged with the
Warped Tour DVD. The band has participated in MEANY Fest, International Pop
Overthrow and LadyfestEast festivals. The Domestics are currently recording
a full-length album for release in Fall 2005.

*Schwervon

Only a couple months into their coupledom, Major Matt Mason and Nan Turner
began jamming. Nan's prior music experience was playing guitar and sometime=
s
bass in the all-girl punky pop band Bionic Finger. Matt's experience
included playing guitar in noisepop bands in Kansas, but he was mainly doin=
g
solo acoustic shows in New York when he met Nan. In the honeymoon of their
romance, Matt brought his electric guitar out of hibernation and Nan starte=
d
banging the drums. Schwervon! was born. Their first album was called Quick
Frozen Small Yellow Cracker, named after a mysteriously labeled box in the
hallway of their NYC apartment. This cd solidified their sound as a "Sonny
and Cher meets the Pixies" garage rock couple who who weren't afraid to get
down to their dirty truths.... and let you into their living room with
ruminations on love, food, money, and their urban surroundings. Their secon=
d
cd, titled Poseur, found them kicking up the volume and production a notch,
tinging their songs with some psychedelic frustration, while continuing to
hone their bittersweet "Who's Araid of Virginia Woolf " pop narratives. The=
y
are currently working on a new cd.
    =A0
*The Trouble Dolls

The Trouble Dolls' roots go back to Kudzu, the cowpunk band formed by singe=
r
Cheri Leone and guitarist Matty Karas in 1986, when both were attending hig=
h
school in Huntington Beach, Calif. Three months after their formation, they
recorded a demo in the garage studio of reclusive pop genius Emitt Rhodes
and sent it to legendary KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer ("Rodney on the ROQ").

Rodney fell in love with the tape, becoming one of Kudzu's first and bigges=
t
supporters. One song from the demo, "Death Valley Girl," was Rodney's
most-requested song for three weeks running -- managing to hold off the
Bangles and the reunited Monkees. The song subsequently appeared on the
Frontier Records compilation Thangs That Twang.

In 1988, Kudzu toured up and down the West Coast as the opening act for Ran=
k
and File. Later that year, following an appearance on MTV's "The Cutting
Edge," they signed to Restless Records. Their Ray Manzarek-produced debut
album, California Scheming, came out in 1989, but few copies made it into
stores, due to the financial difficulties Restless was undergoing at the
time. However, the album did not escape the watchful eyes of lawyers for
United Features Syndicate, which syndicated John Neale's comic strip
"Kudzu." They promptly issued a cease-and-desist order, effectively putting
the last nail in the album's coffin.

Although Kudzu had in fact taken their name not from the strip, but from th=
e
Georgia weed depicted on the cover of R.E.M.'s Murmur, they decided that,
rather than fight, they would call it a day. Matty and Cheri moved to New
York City at the suggestion of a former schoolmate who offered them work
writing and recording music for the Cartoon Network. However, the work
proved to be something less than steady, and the pair separated for a time
to pursue "real world" careers. Cheri studied film at New York University
--while there, she directed the Gutterball video "Trial Separation Blues" -=
-
while Matty became the pop music critic for the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press.

In the summer of 1995, Matty and Cheri reunited to form the Trouble Dolls
with guitarist Michael Taylor, a New Jerseyan who was in an early version o=
f
Monster Magnet but was unceremoniously fired when he refused to learn any
more Hawkwind songs. Michael provided the band's name after discovering
trouble dolls, a Latin American charm, on a trip to Guatemala; but he left
the band in 1998 to pursue a career in television (Trekkies will recognize
him as the writer of some of the best episodes of "Star Trek: Voyager"; the=
y
will also probably be angry at us for calling them Trekkies).

For the first two years of the Trouble Dolls' existence, they were solely a
studio group, recording soundtracks for spaghetti-westerns-that-never-were
on Matty's cranky four-track and making up bios about themselves that
seamlessly blended fact and fiction (a practice which continues to this
day). One of their bargain-basement epics found its way to the BMX Bandits,
who covered the Trouble Dolls' "Love Isn't for the Lazy" on the B-side of a
fan club 45. Another track, "Planet Robin," found its way onto the
soundtrack of the 1996 indie film "Ed's Next Move". Still another, "Ice
Cream Cow," reached WFMU DJs Belinda and Hova, who continue to play it on
their Saturday morning show "Greasy Kid Stuff."

On their way to becoming a proper band, the Trouble Dolls recruited Gabe
Rhodes, a filmmaker and one-time member of the San Francisco band Scenic
Vermont, to play drums after he moved to New York in early 2001. Later that
year, they met Pam Weis while sharing a bill with her band, Bionic Finger,
at the Ladyfest East festival. When Bionic Finger broke up shortly
afterward, Pam became the Trouble Dolls' bassist.

The Trouble Dolls play their aphasic melange of prepackaged, post-Madonna
chanson and bubblegum at New York City clubs such as Luna Lounge, Arlene
Grocery and the Sidewalk Cafe. Their (they can't believe it's their first)
EP, I Don't Know Anything at All, was released in June 2002 on their own
label, La La La Unlimited, and their debut album will follow later in 2002.
They also recently completed the score for the Tony Daniel-directed indie
film "Ame rican Bohemian," in which Matty and Cheri have (totally out of
character!) cameos as musicians who wear silly clothes and smoke.

*Limp Richard

Limp Richard needs no introduction whatsoever, considering his work with hi=
s
seminal outfit Limp Richard and The Disappointments. However, his longtime =
A
& R rep/art therapist has recommended that he try to work some things out
alone, leading to his current style, which Carter Buddlesby of the Entirely
Fictional Times would refer to as "a demented alloy of Sonic Youth and
Michael Penn" if he, in fact existed. Limp is also known by his alter ego,
Todd Carlstrom, who plays lead guitar for The Domestics and writes and
produces theatre with breedingground productions. Limp is managed by the
beautiful and cultivated Remorah.

*Hearth

Hearth is a black heart folk rock band from New York City. They come jangle=
d
and direct, cryptic and depressed.

Virginia natives and cousins Scott Loving and Dan Penta have been playing
together since middle school when the discovery of late-Seventies punk rock
originators gave them the confidence and the drive to start their own band.

Later, recovering from a year long habit, Dan began writing songs on an old
acoustic guitar left behind by Scott who was living in Colorado. These
compositions were minimalist and painfully personal.

Dan relocated to New York, performing alone in the cafes and bars of the
East Village and Williamsburg. A handful listened.

Among them were Kimya Dawson and Adam Green of seminal antifolk group the
Moldy Peaches. They took Dan out with them as an opening act on their first
headlining U.S. tour. On the road Dan got to know their drummer Strictly
Beats a/k/a Brent Cole.

Sometime after the tour, with a newly transplanted Scott Loving on lead
guitar and Dan Penta on rhythm guitar and vocals, Larval Organs was formed
with Brent Cole on drums and Scott Fragala on bass.

Larval Organs gained a following in New York and Brooklyn. An e.p. entitled
Schwag was released on Tuolumne Records. They toured the United Kingdom.

The band came to an abrupt end when Dan was institutionalized following a
psychotic breakdown.

After being released and spending months on Virginia couches, Dan was
invited to play a summer music festival in New York. Performing songs old
and new, he was joined by Scott Fragala on upright bass.

Over the following months the act expanded and changed. Brent was there
again locking down the backbeat. Harmonies were layered by vocalists Amy
Hills and Angela Carlucci. Scott Fragala was replaced by Scott Loving on
electric bass, making everything grounded and full. Cello was added first b=
y
Crystal Madrilejos of the Babyskins and later by Benjamin Kalb who performs
also with Regina Spektor.

They called themselves Hearth and they rose from Avenue A. They have since
taken the stage at Pianos, Sin-e, Bowery Poetry Club, and more.

Recently a three song e.p. was completed with producer Mark Christensen at
Engine Room Audio in Manhattan. The recordings are a conscious movement
towards high fidelity - too tortured and too bizarre to be pop, too tender
and too polished to be punk. Hearth continue to define their sound and
direction. They reach. The high is to play. Everything else remains.

*The Marianne Pillsburys

Maine native Marianne Pillsbury writes pop-rock songs with cleverly-crafted=
,
hook-laden melodies and brash, witty, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Released in
2004, her debut album The Wrong Marianne has received enthusiastic reviews
from The New York Times, Time Out New York, The Boston Herald and The San
Francisco Chronicle and elicited comparisons to the best work of Liz Phair,
Juliana Hatfield and Jill Sobule. The album was named a Top 12 DIY Pick in
Performing Songwriter Magazine. The song "Boo Hoo" won Best Alt/Rock Song i=
n
The Great American Song Contest 2004 and was also selected for inclusion on
ROCKRGRL magazine's Discoveries 2005 compilation CD.

Her Brooklyn-based band The Marianne Pillsburys bring Marianne's songs to
life with a raw punk-pop vibe. Think: Blondie, Elastica, Liz Phair fronting
The Rolling Stones, or Juliana Hatfield singing lead for The Pixies. The
band has played NYC venues like Mercury Lounge, Luna Lounge, Pianos,
Arlene's Grocery and Southpaw, out-of-town venues in Boston, DC, LA and San
Francisco, and festivals like M.E.A.N.Y. Fest (Musicians & Emerging Artists
in New York), International Pop Overthrow and the Millenium Music
Conference.

In April 2005, the band released a 3-song demo called "The Hot EP" produced
by the fabulously talented Roger Greenawalt (Ben Kweller, Ben Lee).

MEET THE BAND:

Sandy Brockwell (bass & backing vox) Hailing from the grande state of Tejas=
,
Sandy B. Rock-well certainly lives up to her name. Besides rocking well, he=
r
interests include surfing, horror movies, economics and tequila.

Mitch Distefano (lead guitar & backing vox) Mitch enjoys his role as the
whipping boy of the band. Being a Brooklyn native, he can of course hold hi=
s
own. In addition to being a rock star guitarist, he also gives rock star
guitar lessons.

Dawn McGrath (drums) Queens native Dawn (pronounced "dwon") has earned her
black belt in drumming by eating, breathing and sleeping drums while
surrounded by her 700 bald Cabbage Patch Kids.

*Chris Maher

Meet Chris Maher (pronounced mar): A 24 year-old songwriter from New York
City, wise beyond his years and schooled below his wise, proud and
protective of the tricks up his sleeve.=A0 His music is oft an exercise in
contradiction: Neurotic and savvy, country and city, wry and idealistic.
He=B9s a deft adjuster but his fear of pigeonholes has been his pitfall =AD
to-date, he has only one =8Creleased=B9 song to his credit.
=A0
Although Chris has been playing around NYC since the not-so-tender age of
15, he=B9s always felt most comfortable on the fence, never content to limit
himself to any one particular musical community. Back in 2000, when first
crashing the Lower East Side=B9s love-it-or-detest-it Antifolk scene, Chris
was busy playing bass for hip-hop band Automato as they were writing their
DFA-produced debut=A0 - what else to do when Woody and Wu Tang make equal
sense?=A0 These days, he=B9s playing a variety of instruments in a variety of
bands and has played shows (on his own) alongside a smorgasbord of fellow
writers like Mirah, Nellie McKay, the Dirty Projectors, Mike Doughty and
Mount Eerie. This past summer, Chris embarked on his first West Coast tour,
opening for the mighty AFNY-ers Jeffrey and Jack Lewis and Kimya Dawson.
=A0
Although the only currently-available Maher-penned song appears on the debu=
t
7-inch by The Morningsides - a two-song single recorded by Walter Martin of
The Walkmen - new Chris Maher compositions are finally ready for release:
=B3Ungrown Flowers=B2 will be featured on a compilation from Seattle=B9s
Baskerville Hill label, Married Media will release a video for a new
recording of =B3mE=3Dmc(squared)=B2 and New York=B9s Recommended If You Like Record=
s
will release Chris=B9 debut album, Epigram on the Death of a Feeling =AD a
collection of songs that recall the verbose bitterness of Songs of Love and
Hate-era Leonard Cohen, the restrained tenderness of Being There-era Wilco
and the aggressive melodicism of Let It Be-era Replacements.
=A0
In late-2005, Chris will tour from New York to California with Sonya Cotton
and plans to embark on a full-scale national tour upon the release of
Epigram... Chris will also further indulge his eclectic tendencies by
recording an EP of material as Volumes, with members of The Fugue, and a
single with his lap-pop project, Trouble Tape!

*Genan Zilkha

Genan Zilkha, guitar/vocals, was a classically trained pianist until she
found that she had a taste of rock and roll.  Since that didn't work out,
she now spends her time writing folk songs with titles such as "I Think I
Might Be Food Poisoning (But it could also be love)" and "I Know What Will
Make You Not A Dyke".  Genan is also known for her unique takes on Britney
Spears songs, in particular her version of Britney's Version of "My
Prerogative".  She has performed at  the Knitting Factory, as well as at
venues throughout Rhode Island and Binghamton, NY.

>
> It has been three months since Hurricane Katrina ripped through the
> southern coast of the United States, decimating communities in
> Mississippi and Louisiana. After the initial slow government response to
> the disaster, President Bush flew to the region and promised the
> government will "do what it takes, stay as long as it takes, to help our
> citizens rebuild their communities and their lives." Well that promise
> is feeling increasingly hollow to many people.
>
> Today is the start of the Survivors General Assembly and Strategy
> Conference in Jackson, Mississippi. Katrina survivors are gathering at
> this conference and demanding the right to return to their homes and to
> take part in the reconstruction process. They are also calling for
> reparations for what they say is the government's criminal indifference
> and malicious actions towards the survivors before, during and after
> Katrina.
>
> But survivors are not the only ones speaking out. Local reporters and
> politicians from both sides of the aisle have criticized the
> government's inaction.
>
> On Wednesday, Mississippi Republican Governor Haley Barbour, a staunch
> Bush supporter and former chair of the Republican National Committee
> stated, "we are at a point where our recovery and renewal efforts are
> stalled because of inaction in Washington D.C." Barbour went on to say
> there was no money to rebuild highways and bridges and school districts
> were close to bankruptcy. And he was just referring to Mississippi.
>
> The city of New Orleans remains in a state of emergency with most
> residents unable to return. Many say they have been abandoned by the
> federal government, the same way they were abandoned during the first
> days of the storm. The Times-Picayune carried an editorial on the front
> page recently pleading "Do Not Let the City Die." Local advocates say
> the government is not committed to rebuilding the city for all of its
> citizens. They point to the fact that few public housing units have been
> reopened and that landlords are being allowed to evict people in mass
> numbers.
>
> 80% of New Orleans residents have not returned. And those who have are
> mostly white and wealthy. African-Americans especially feel the
> government is not making an effort to ensure that they are able to
> return. A group of homeless evacuees are filing a lawsuit in Federal
> Court today contending that FEMA engaged in illegal practices by denying
> or delaying their requests for temporary housing. They are also
> demanding that the agency back off of its plan to kick people out of
> their hotels in the coming days. The FEMA deadline for evacuees to be
> out of their hotels is December 15th with evacuees in some states
> granted until January 7th to find new housing.
>
> A recent poll conducted by the Washington Post found 61% of evacuees

FLOOD EDITIONS <http://www.floodeditions.com/>

Jennifer Moxley, Often Capital.
First published as two separate chapbooks in 1995 and 1996, Often
Capital explores the tensions between political commitment and personal
desire. Moxley draws in part on the love letters of the Polish radical
Rosa Luxemburg in searching out a habitable space for resistance. As she
writes in an afterword to this volume, "In my researches I mistook my
title, Often Capital--a banal dictionary designation--as a description
of, to use William Godwin's phrase, 'things as they are.' Yes, often
capital I thought, but thankfully not always."

Ronald Johnson, Radi os.
First published in 1977, Ronald Johnson's Radi os revises the first four
books of Paradise Lost by excising words, discovering a modern and
visionary poem within the seventeenth-century text. As the author
explains, "To etch is 'to cut away,' and each page, as in Blake's
concept of a book, is a single picture." With God and Satan crossed out,
Radi os reduces Milton's baroque poem to elemental forces. In this
retelling of the Fall, song precipitates from chaos, sight from fire:
"in the shape / as of / above the / rose / through / rose / rising / the
radiant sun."

Merrill Gilfillan, Undanceable.
With exuberance and economy, Merrill Gilfillan's Undanceable evokes the
landscape of the American West through the geographic word. Place names,
the texture of speech, and a certain aroma of nature permeate these
pages. Ever alert to unforeseen connections, Gilfillan follows both eye
and ear, his poems unfolding at the pace of consciousness.

Pam Rehm, Short Works.
Small Works is Pam Rehm's sixth book of poetry. While moving towards an
ever more spare clarity,
 Rehm awakens the moral senses through bewilderment, impatience, and
quizzical humor. Amid the crowded anonymity of an increasingly anxious
urban life, these poems take sustenance from the natural world,
children's games, and familiar valedictions: "The world of consequence
be with you / always."

Norma Cole, Spinoza in Her Youth.
Norma Cole's rich and rigorous poems delight in and disrupt the framing
structures of language, memory, history, so as to inhabit new fluencies
of possibility. Informed by a diversity of subject matter (including
emotional, political, philosophic), each poem finds its balance of form
and content upon the knifepoint of a lyric integrity that is as
responsive to the gravity of experience as it is to the fallibility of
our means of representing it.

Rosmarie Waldrop, Love, Like Pronouns.
With the title of her latest collection Waldrop demonstrates with deft
humor the relational aspects of any discourse. She implicitly suggests a
similar slipperiness in human emotion and speech, as both the love
object and the pronoun's referent easily shift with, even because of any
attempt to articulate it. In this collection, poem cycles dedicated to
other writers echo with subtle synchronisms of those writers' forms,
tones, and textures. From out of this synchronism, Waldrop evolves her
own unique mediums of address.

Keith Waldrop, The Real Subject, Queries and Conjectures of Jacob
Delafon with sample poems.
Not exactly a novel and not really a poem, The Real Subject contains
some verses and is not without characters. Jacob Delafon, whose musings
are here presented, is a man late in life who has gotten around--at
least in his own mind--read a great deal, unsystematically, thought
(with even less system) about what he has seen, heard, what he comes up
against. He is, in fact, a unique geezer, whose trains of thought seem
often on tracks without station or schedule. To move one to another of
Jacob Delfon's turns of mind and twisted meditations requires not fast,
but careful footwork. There is no set path. The interest is in the steps.

It was wonderful to read this post.  I've been a student of Goenka's vipassana for thirty-five years, an erratic practitioner until four years ago when the daily practice became regular, at last, and have derived many benefits both from the retreats and the practice.  It was good to see and hear of someone else on this list having encountered and becoming involved in vipassana bhavana. I'm convinced also that this practice has helped me in my creative life.

ago where he came face to face with the misery all of us spend our days
running from -- and he realized he needed to do something about it. He
was given a volume of Hafiz's poetry and began to think about
meditation, the life of love, God, and a way out of suffering.

He took time off from the band and from Harvard -- and eventually found
vipassana meditation. Here's what he writes about vipassana:

>> Hafiz wrote hundreds of ghazals [or love songs], finding ways to bring

>> ideal unattainable girl, his sweet affection for his wife, his tender
>> feelings for his child…his relationship with his teacher and his
>> adoration of God.

>> I was struck by the connection between all these different forms of

>> spiritual teachings therefore opened up to me for the first time since,

>> spiritual teachings as coded instructions for how to connect with my

>> to plunge deep into yourself upon this path to Musical Creativity.”
>> Like this, I just replaced the word God wherever I saw it. I had

>> I eagerly studied a wide variety of traditions including the mystical

understanding
>> of these teachings, I abruptly dropped all of my business
>> responsibilities and hard-won power, and isolated myself once again. I

>> celibacy. I gave away or sold most of my possessions, my house, and my

>> Mcleod, and other sources I began reading, showed me a new way to
work.
>> Instead of generating peak experiences for inspiration, I could

There's a digital theorist writing on the computer arts who published a  highly reputed book with M.I.T. Press in the past four years or  so.  His basic thesis or his most innovative approach, and the  first couple of chapters of the book, were to root digital arts back to  cinema, and in specific Russian experimentalist cinema.  The book  is heavily illustrated with stills from films.  He himself is, I  believe, originally Russian.

  Can anybody remember this writer's name (and the title of the book)?

  (The writer also has a reputation, in his hype, for being a beau brummel and stylish.)

Once upon a time, there was a cease-fire among the bloods & Crips, mainly
because the O.G.'s of both decided that it wasn't worth it. Then, these same
G's got locked up...the youngster's decided they didn't want to keep going
what the G's started...& the G's couldn't do much about it from prison, so
it all started up again.

Is interesting, though, that the level of violence between the bloods &
Crips is nowhere near the level it was in the late 80's / early 90's...it
was crazy back then...I remember it not too fondly.

drn,

It is certainly a good thing that all jews don't have the same politics or
write the same kind of poetry or like the same kind of men and women. I was
once  accused of being a shiksha by my husband who wasn't even jewish. I would
have had a mad crush on you in H.S.

Suffer better if both.

Is suffering alone life or life alone suffering?
Live better, sufferers.

If suffering is left alone to live will living suffer through life?

Poetics,

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 20 pieces by M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny.

It is like this: paradigms don't shift around pillars, posts, or
pedestals; they pirouette on point.

Come see the daring young man on the flying trapeze of language. Bring
the word "yes", you'll need it.

Regards,
Dan

Ditto.  To this day I still take great care when walking outside wearing
anything red (Bloods) or blue (Crips).  I can't think of Burger King or
Calvin Klein without imagining their appropriated initials: BK (Blood
Killer) or CK (Crip Killer).  It seems the threat of getting shot on
sight for wearing red or blue seems to have diminished, however, since
I've seen red show up in the uniforms of a local elementary school,
something unheard of fifteen years ago.

Ah, well.  Life in So Cal.

will body ever mind
being subjected
if you look inside your  mind
you're looking from inside your head
will body mind or will will  mind?
life minds death
but death doesn't mind
no two minds are  willing
or able to be of one mind about life
two bodies can be of one  mind
and willfully or unwillingly
create one body of a different  mind
each morning i wonder
why each evening i wish
i could think  differently
about my body and your mind
or my mind and your body

Hi:

I came upon a video piece about the restoration of the Edward Austin Abbey murals in the old Boston Public Library in Copley Square.  This room is on the second floor.  Jack Spicer worked upstairs in the Rare Book Room.  Here's a link to the video. Take a look to see some of the images that turned Jack on.

 blb-1   Jukka-Pekka Kervinen
 '(no subject)' - 427pp - $23.81                      isbn 9529963211

Kervinen has written a text that includes all types of language:
current affairs, numerals, neologisms, portmanteau words, new
ways of constructing  syntax, all adding to an exciting sequence
of words. The language has a sort of game-quality to it, one can
spend hours decoding, sounding out, glancing through. or just
reading this sparkling text.

 blb-2   Jim Leftwich
 'thetextasifsuch' - 528pp - $26.84                isbn: 9529963203

Jim Leftwich is represented here by his poetry and essays from
the early 21st century. The title 'textasifsuch' has more relevance
to a practice of writing that calls itself 'text' and is specifically so,
in the full sense of the word. It could be defined as the pure
essence of writing, with a pared-down wording that mirrors
the consciousness of the writer. Leftwich's words are worth
engaging into reading.

 blb3   J Hayes Hurley
 'Motion and Rest' - 483pp - $27.49              isbn: 952006322X
 revised edition available January 15, 2006

fiction. "Motion and Rest" is a modern western with a Gnostic
twist. The narrator, Robert Glin, is a Montana-born paperback
western genre writer who wants to be the next Louis L'Amour.
He is challenged by a pair of European documentary film-
makers to write an "authentic" new western novel instead.
Robert meets an old drifter named Thomas Sligo who claims
to be a Gnostic god fallen to earth and in need of saving
himself. Robert does not take Sligo's claim seriously, though
he sees in Sligo the authentic character he needs for his novel.
He joins Sligo in drifting about the west and eventually invites
the filmmakers along. More characters join the god's caravan
and as they drift about a number of modern western themes
are explored, minor miracles are performed by the god, philo-
sophical issues are discussed, guns are bandied about, and
the atmosphere is at once comic, wistful, and mystsical.

  blb4    Peter Ganick
 'why: ...1 ...2 ...3 ...4' - 319pp - $19.57        isbn: 9529963238

poetry. four longpoems that surround the text 'why'. should
'why' be followed by a question mark, a period, or a comma,
or all of theabove? originally the longpoems were composed
for separate occasions, but are now collected in this book
due to conjunctions in syntax, memory, and time when writ-
ten. a flow is established in each longpoem that carries the
reader forward through a postmodern reconstruction of the
wordlless word, 'why'. unanswerable...

 blb5   Scott MacLeod
 'Post Empire" p- 288pp - $19.64                 isbn: available soon
 book available now

Post Empire is a meditation/incantation on the graspings
and whitherings of  the tentacles of empire. MacLeod appro-
priates and recomposes computer virus code, internet
search results, film stills, EBay listings, stolen poetry,
newspaper reports, academic theses and much more to
create a marching band playing the death rattle in the
throat of Western civilization. Prose, poetry and visual art
follow a dusty trail leading from Alphaville through Ground
Zero though Abu Ghraib to - where? To appropriate & para-
phrase German artist Franz John's description of his own
work: [MacLeod's] interest is not in the [word]-chain itself
but rather in the tectonic forces and energies of a matrix
which is visibly and continually updating and renewing itself.

The Cowboy & George Dubya



While riding one day around a Crawford, TX ranch,
a cowboy met George Dubya riding along with a dog
and a sheep and he began a conversation.

 Cowboy: "Hey, cool dog you got there. Mind if I speak to him?"
 George Dubya: "Dog don?t talk."
 Cowboy: "Hey dog, how's it going?"

 Dog: "Doin' alright."
 George Dubya: Look of shock.
 Cowboy: "Is this smirking man your owner?" pointing at George Dubya.

 Dog: "Yep"
 Cowboy: "How does he treat ya?"
 Dog: "Real good. He walks me twice a day, feeds me great food,

 and takes me to the lake once a week to play."
 George Dubya: Look of total disbelief.
 Cowboy: "Mind if I talk to your horse?"

 George Dubya: "Horse don?t talk."
 Cowboy: "Hey horse, how's it going?"
 Horse: "Just trottin? along."

 George Dubya: Extreme look of shock.
 Cowboy: "Is this your owner?" pointing at George Dubya.
 Horse: "Yes sir! "

 Cowboy: "How's he treatin' ya?"
 Horse: "Pretty good, thanks for asking. He rides me  regularly,
 brushes me down often, and keeps me in a shed to protect me."

 George Dubya: Total look of utter amazement.
 Cowboy: "Mind if I talk to your sheep?"
 George Dubya: "Sheep?s a big liar."

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

 >>PUB: anthology of writing by nurses seeks submissions
=================================================

Call for Submissions
http://www.paulasergi.com/call_for_submissions.htm

This is a call to nurses. We are looking for nurses who:
           Continue to practice but considered leaving;
           Have left practice;
           Still identify as a nurse but have another calling in their
lives.

Consider:
           Who or what holds you in place as a nurse? Who or what influenced
your decision to stay?
           Who or what influenced your decision to leave practice?
           What is the other calling that shapes your life? How does it
intersect with your identity as a nurse?

As an oral culture, nurses told their stories to one another, but felt
little urgency to document our history. But what is not preserved cannot
beckon or
inspire. When asked the reason for their career choice, students often
respond
with tales of nurses who impacted their lives or the lives of loved ones.
They come to nursing drawn by the magnetic force of another. When we accept
guidance from someone we admire, are we then not vested to pass it on?
And if we do
so with greater generosity, would that affect the nursing shortage?
Whether we stay raises larger questions. What compels us to remain steadfast
to commitment or open ourselves to change? This tension is central to our
choices in vocations, marriages, political ideology. Whether we remain in
practice (as does one of the editors) or seek professional fulfillment
elsewhere (as
does the other) those who crossed our paths impact our decisions. We invite
the voices of other nurses to join us in writing toward self-knowledge and
professional discernment.
Feel free to explore the guidelines in creative and innovative ways. The
pieces we are looking for might be â€œinspirationalâ€ in effect; however
this is
not our intention. Our goal is a thoughtful collection which testifies
to the
complexity of the nursing profession and the myriad variables which
determine
our response to it.
Submit short essays, prose pieces (6-8 pages long, double spaced) or poems.
Please send electronic copies to both:
Geraldine Gorman ggorman@uic.edu

If e-mail is not possible. Please send 2 copies to:

There is a new CD released available at CDBABY.com by Elya Finn, "When I met
you". Michael Rothenberg wrote all the songs on the CD. This album features
soft rock with overtones of jazz and Kurt Weill. Michael Rothenberg's lyrics
are the most intelligent lyrics I've heard in years. Elya Finn, a skilled
and sensitive vocalist, renders them with tenderness and passion. Highly
recommended! So check it out: http://cdbaby.com/cd/elyafinn2. You can listen
to songs for free there and you might want to order it.

Emancipating Pragmatism (emerson, jazz and experimental writing) by Michael
McGee  (U of Alabama Press)

A Poetics of Impasse in Modern and Contemporary American Poetry by Susan M.
Schultz (U of Alabama Press).

While I am in a praise mode - a much more pleasurable place to be in than a
"down Bush" etc. mode - I want to say I like these books very much.  In
fact, for those who are impulsively leery of 'crit lit' books coming out of
University Presses, I find the work in this series genuinely readable - the
writers work from a point of view of having a real and personal stake and
challenge in coming to terms with the poets and their works (A slow reader,
in terms of recent books, I still have Aldon Nielson's Integral Music:
Languages of African-American Innovation to come to;  Marc Scroggins' Louis
Zukofsky and the Poetry of Knowledge is a terrific introduction to the
breadth of Z's diverse project - tho I suspect he would also say that the
"Zuk investigation" is still on its way to many further
critical/interpretive rounds. By the way, accessible on the web, Jeffrey
Twitchell's progressing Concordance for "A" already a big help).

The UAP series, however, as edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer,
share an integrity in their search to find the value, use and potential
direction of what we - at least, within the USA -  as poets and readers
currently inherit in the way of 19th and 20th century poets and poetries: a
turning of the envelope inside out to see what and how certain strategies
have accomplished, what they omit, and what they may or may not satisfy. Th=
e
attention, in terms of the poets variously covered, is clearly not on those
who write "closed narratives"  The focus is more on what has been opened -
poetries in which the language is taking risks: personal, social, political
- and questioning where is one, both poet and reader, left either standing
or moving in the face of reading the goods.

In the case of Susan Schultz and Michael McGee the working assumption is
that public language (whether it be poetry or other forms of discourse) as
given or handed down by the culture(s) is at odds with reality of the poet'=
s
personal and/or public experience and perception. In McGee's book,
pragmatism becomes the operative instrument in shaping a language of both
opposition, as well as a way of testing words, and finding ones accurate to
experience. McGee is very good in tracing how this issue is dramatically
present in Emerson - for example his need, and those of fellow abolitionist=
s
to create a language that will render the reality of slavery in a manner
that will work to defeat the laws, the myths, etc. that proclaim the social
benefits of such ownership. (Today, one is too easily reminded of
Bush/Cheney, etc. speaking about the national benefits of 'torture."  of ,
slave holders, etc.). He pursues this pragmatic thread through Ellison's
Invisible Man, right up to the New York School amongst the civil rights
eruptions of the early sixties. Among many parts, one of my favorite
sections is the investigation of the friendship between Frank O'Hara and
Amiri Baraka (s then, Leroi Jones), which finds part of its center at the
Five Spot, the jazz nightclub in the Village. Contrary to the clich=E9 versio=
n
of the effete NY School poets versus the 'on the ground' Beats - that image
of the reading in which Gregory Corso is pictured as shouting down the
Mandarins.  To contrary O'Hara and Baraka were correspondents and close,
with O'Hara coming off as deeply engaged in issues of race and its impact
on poetic form and language. I won't spoil or minimize McGee's take other
than to say it makes one more compelling reason to get the the book.

Susan Schultz follows another thread. Where McGee is following a masculine
one - albeit from Emerson on the authors are deeply besieged or challenged
by languages that variously betray them both personally, as well as the
culture's they represent - Schultz is much more engaged in establishing and
exploring a "feminine tradition" as carried on by both men and women poets
in the 20th Century. (Crane, Riding, Stein, Ashberry, R Johnson, Susan Howe=
,
Hawaiian Pidgin writers and performers, and Charles Bernstein are among her
subjects.) In one way her project is similar to McGee's in that she is
working to demarcate spaces in the literature that are ignored, violently o=
r
otherwise. Her analysis, for example, of John Ashberry's refusal, and
writing struggle to not be taken under the wing of Harold Bloom's critical
appropriation is fascinating (tho a little exhausting). Similarly she looks
at the way in which Ronald Johnson uses the 'outside' materials and
tradition of cooking as a means to inform the shape and content of his work=
.
Whether it be Howe, Crane, or Laura Riding, she is focused on where this
'feminine' voice/space/material emerges and, willingly by the poet or not,
stays alive in the work or gets erased. Indeed there is a personal urgency
here to establish, fight for and draw from this particular well.

Susan's wrestling - both loving and resisting - with the example and work o=
f
Charles Berstein to find where she stands - is both fun and intriguing.
Particularly the way in which her exploration of Charles' father (maker of
'ready-mades' in the garment business) becomes a foil for his making poems
that, in a way, refuse to cooperate and "fit"; and that phenomena coupled
with how the poetry's aesthetic/political critique can seem to go at odds
with Charles as the businessman poet, clearly knowing how to work and
satisfy the demands of, at least, the academic system and market. It is als=
o
a question that weighs on the path and choices of her own writing and
career.=20

She compares these mainland traditions to the Hawaiian writers in Pidgin wh=
o
defy the colonial imposition of 'proper English' and steer a course that
insists on sustaining an indigenous integrity. (I find myself with issues
here - in that I think something more interesting occurs when the writing i=
s
multi-lingual and able to collide 'corporate English', for example, against
the languages and play of the indigenous.) Schultz teaches in Hawaii and is
publisher (co?) of Tinfish Books and magazine. I am not surprised she finds
home in a places of division and pluralities (given the radius of Pacific
Rim) - as say different than a tenure track job in the Ivy League, or other
bastion(s) traditionally devoted to protecting and furthering "The
Tradition."=20
In each of these various investigations of writers, she is clearly working
to find a ground whose resources and literary tradition (tho still much at
the margins) will feed her writing (one hesitates to say 'as a woman', sinc=
e
the feminine space she is defining is not 'gendered' by its potential
users). =20

In terms of this series of critical books (particularly given Charles B's
editorial association with Hank Lazar) I do find it ironic in terms of the
de-authorization, de-personal codes of 70's and 80's Language Poetries -
whatever that may now mean (and were these terms true to the the actual
poetry?) - that these works of Michael McGee and Susan Schultz have such a
personal (and winsome) sense of struggle, love and way of working through
the materials. Though the books are obviously deeply thought out, I rarely
feel like I am "off the ground" in some airborne, abstracted way, but with
people who are right/write in it and for which the stakes have very real
bearing on the way one builds a way of reading as well  as a way of writing
and being in this world.

god damn it's slow.

perhaps an odd question, but does anyone know if any novelists have dealt
with this with any acuity?

also, on a slightly different note, does anyone know of any novels that deal
with the mind and cultures of fundamentalism at any depth, if that is not a
contradiction in terms?

ja?

> why  must it [poetry] be expanded  what does it mean  to begin with?

the second sentence of the hejinian quote gives some indication of why:
"without expanding that definition, literature and culture are going to be
left with a limited number of irrelevant models of poetry as objects of
aesthetic reverie but of no relevance to thought or experience or
contemporary living."

the "something like a revolution" hejinian mentions in the interview with
charles bernstein i quoted is not simply a result of the so-called
'communications revolution,' but of course has strong relation with it.

one could trace it back quite some way, at least to apollinaire, but here is
a quote from 1966 from dick higgins:

"For the last ten years or so, artists have changed their media to suit this
situation, to the point where the media have broken down in their
traditional forms, and have become merely puristic points of reference. The
idea has arisen, as if by spontaneous combustion throughout the entire
world, that these points are arbitrary and only useful as critical tools, in
saying that such-and-such a work is basically musical, but also poetry. This
is the intermedial approach, to emphasize the dialectic between the media."
http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Higgins/intermedia2.html

intermedial but also strongly tuned to its media/um.

in the audio work of ws burroughs, gregory whitehead, paul green, rod
summers, susan stone, douglas kahn and several others, we see something much
more exciting for radio and recorded sound--to me, anyway--than poets
reading their work or, for that matter, radio drama. partly because they
took radio and recorded sound seriously as literary media. think of what you
would get if, say, writers for print did not take writing seriously as
literary media but instead thought of what they did primarily as an oral
thing, or something else, and their print work was an afterthought or
secondary to some other media/um. that's what you get usually with recorded
sound and radio. but not in the work of the 'audio writers'.

so attention to/understanding of the media/um you work in is important if it
is to be considered seriously as literary media. and of course over the last
twenty years, mainly via computers and the 'communications revolution,' but
also in the work of people such as kosuth and holzer and other visual
artists strongly engaged with language, things like recorded sound, computer
screens, gallery spaces and other spaces have been explored as serious
literary media. and the work is usually hybrid in that it usually involves
not only the word but other entities/media, as is the case in the work of
the audio writers who of course are dealing with not only language but audio
more generally (and language in a more general sense). or, in the case of
kosuth and holzer, there's strong relation with visual art. same with most
net art--which is mostly what i'm involved in these days and computer art
more generally.

i'm sure others would place emphasis on other expansions of poetry, but
these are the ones that have meant the most to me.

rather than solely identifying poetry as something that happens on a page or
in speech, the notion is becoming more generalized to intense engagement
with language wherever it occurs.

but hejinian might have had something entirely different in mind, dunno.
what i know of her work is pretty concentrated on the page, so she may have
been thinking of expansions within that realm in relation to language
poetry. because the 'something like a revolution' she alludes to is not
simply a result of expanded and new technology, but of what is behind that.
and what might that be? well, concerning the digital, what is behind it?
what drives it, apart from technology, i mean. surely it's theoretical
computer science, which is heavily involved in the study of the properties
of language. going back to godel and turing (and even back to leibniz, if
you like, as martin davis writes in 'The Universal Computer: The Road from
Leibniz to Turing'). language as very much involved in process. process as
expressed in language. and concern with language as process and process as
expressed in language is not really even limited to computer science or
formal logic, is it. and i suppose that concentration also on language in a
broader sense, not just on the written or spoken word, but all the
dimensions of language, is part of what hejinian may be referring to
concerning expanding the definition of what poetry is.

it has to be able to go where intensest engagement with language is in order
for it to comprehend contemporary thought, and it has to be able to go where
the word is communicated popularly for it to remain relevant to experience
and contemporary living.

Is there a psychological category/classification for "male hysteria"? I
admit to suffering from what that is on occasion. But it begins to strike me
that Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Gonzales et al are "male-hysterics". I suspect it
was not the Twin Towers but the plane that went into the Pentagon (the
equivalent of their private parts) that provoked a full dose, now over 4
year sustained attack of this nationally self-destructive hysteria. In their
madness they have torn-up the constitution, tortured, etc., etc.

Not a pretty site! Pretty crazy. It will be interesting to see if the U.S.A.
Congress and Judiciary will have the courage to stop enabling this disease.
I suspect, sadly, the recovery will be quite slow.

If not, she certainly helps keep those boyz hysteria stirred-up, cooperates
with them and does their bidding, as well.

She is definitely in the 'nest' of the "N'est pas."

Did anybody notice the item in today's New York Times that Donald
Rumsfeld lives in the house in Maryland that once belonged to Edward
Covey, a slavemaster whose sadism  Frederick Douglass made infamous in
his classic "Narrative" (and whom that same Douglass physically
fought, in a memorable confrontation)?

If ever a location were more suited to its present occupant, it would
be this one.  Hopefully one of the gardeners or servants will get
around to kicking Rumsfeld's ass and writing about it later.

In the trade men who fit the diagnosis have been referred to as hysterics
for at least thirty years, without embarrassment, tho informally one
sometimes hears "male hysteric." Neither the male nor the female kind is
referred to as hysteria in the DSM, the standard Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, which breaks the psyche's possibilities into
insurance-company-frindly numbered cotegories. A list of them can be found
at http://mysite.verizon.net/res7oqx1/id17.html.

OOPS! Sorry, wr=ong list (I think)


In the trade men who fit the diagnosis have been referred to as hysterics
for at least thirty years, without embarrassment, tho informally one
sometimes hears "male hysteric." Neither the male nor the female kind is
referred to as hysteria in the DSM, the standard Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, which breaks the psyche's possibilities into
insurance-company-frindly numbered cotegories. A list of them can be found
at http://mysite.verizon.net/res7oqx1/id17.html.

A new Frontline set to air in January looks at lives of rural at-risk teens.

The Story Behind "Country Boys"

By filmmaker David Sutherland

Just before "The Farmer's Wife" first aired in 1998, one of my funders for the program conducted a test screening. The response was generally positive, but a large number of viewers said that the Buschkoetters didn't "look poor." I was surprised, to say the least, because even though they had a small house and sent their children to parochial school, the family lived way below the poverty level and often didn't have enough food to eat.
So that response got me thinking, "What does poverty look like?" I remembered the photos on the covers of Life and Look magazines in the late '50s and early '60s, when the media had sent correspondents down to West Virgina and the rest of Appalachia, and I thought how over the last 25 years poverty has taken on an urban face. I don't mean to say that urban poverty isn't a problem, but over the past decade or so, media coverage has focused more and more on breaking news and urban issues and less and less on the plight of the rural poor.
That convinced me to go to Appalachia. After "The Farmer's Wife" aired, I worked with the Lutheran Disaster Relief and other rural mental health groups to speak with family farmers in the Midwest, and through this work, I was introduced to a network of preachers and service groups that extends across Appalachia. With their help, I gained access to backwoods hollows where reporters and filmmakers can't usually go.
As I began my search for subjects -- a search that took me into every county in West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky -- I read several syndicated columns about how rural America is being left behind in the technology age. I am a portraitist, not an investigative reporter, but what I saw totally belied the articles. As an example: In 1999, much of Magoffin County (in Kentucky) was at or below the lowest poverty level in the United States; in that same year, 70 percent of that county was wired for the Internet, way above the national average at that time. Imagine, throughout Appalachia, seeing children coming out of a clapboard trailer, surrounded by fighting cocks in cages and attack dogs, and on the roof of the trailer there's this enormous satellite dish! Everyone had MTV, and no matter how poor the conditions in which these families lived, all the kids understood my '60s lingo. Nothing was what I had assumed it would be. The teenagers in these areas were sophisticated on the
computer in a way that even affluent college students sometimes are not. They were buying strings for their guitars on the same web site as David Bowie -- I mean, they knew everything.
And so, originally, I had wanted to do a portrait of a small hollow. But I was so struck by the sophistication level of the high school kids, and by their media perceptions of themselves through the outside world, that I shifted my focus entirely. I guess I was most interested in the commonality between Appalachian kids and kids all over the U.S. I never have an agenda, and I knew that the social issues raised in an area with drastically limited opportunities would resonate with people from all walks of life.
When I decided to film at the David School, I needed the type of access where I could film the classroom scenes close up and intimate like in the TV series "My So Called Life" -- except that was fiction and this film is real life. Chris Johnson and Cody Perkins both had strong personalities and strong voices -- they were able to speak clearly and effectively about what was going on in their lives. I always trust my instincts, and when I found them I knew they would be in it for the long haul.
Life happens faster in Appalachia -- you've got to get a job when you get out of high school, there's no other choice, and kids get thrown into adulthood much faster than they do in suburbia. Besides the usual drama of teenage life, both kids had troubled pasts with school and their families, and I knew that if I followed them, there would be a drama that would be both universal and representative of Appalachia.

Not only that, Cheny & the Lynn have moved to a house called Misery.
Which each cause so deeply in others.
Nominative Destiny or accident?

FYI:  Freud was the first to deliver a lecture on male
hysteria in 1886. for wch he was roundly comdemned.  Acc. to
that early lecture, the etiology of male hysteria was some
form of psycho-sexual trauma in early childhood.  No surprise,
I guess.

And now for a little soapboxing and boilerplating:  Seems to
me, tho, we have long lived in a society that promotes
hysteria--that juices up the adrenal networks with unending
sexual imagery and innuendo--that leads us to believe that the
phrase "free to do the things I want to" and images of being
away from it all (see any genital warts commercial) is just
another way to say "I want to have sex whenever and wherever I
can"--that has generated a society of perpetual adolescents
with the requisite anxiety-filled fantasies (see every tv show
on the air)--all of which people try to brush aside with
flaccid irony or ativan--America's recent government's just
another symptom of this dilemma.

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

the diagnosis of male hysteria, as i recall, was wiped out of german
nosology between the wars because it legitimated war-time distress,
requiring the state to provide pensions for sufferers.  hysteria, instead,
was converted into unGermaness, unmanliness, queerness.  there are several
books on the topic, including a book by george mosse that touches on it.

I would add:
It's now been learned hat George Bush & Associates - all caught with their
pants down - have declared that a previously secret Executive decision will
make Impeachment clauses in the Constitution - for the duration of the
terror threat - no longer applicable. The suspension of Elections - as a
nuisance to the 'war on terror'  are also being considered by the Executive
as we speak (and are 'surveilled & monitored'!) .

Bush, concerned about his poll ratings, will have Dick Cheney deliver these
announcements.

bios:

*Dan Fishback

Raised on a steady diet of showtunes and secular Jewish leftism, Dan
Fishback was destined to be gay and loud. In 2003, he moved to New York
City, where he promptly became a fixture in the legendary Anti-Folk
community. As half of the indie-pop duo Cheese On Bread, Dan saturated the
Lower East Side with his signature blend of coy spunk and fierce progressiv=
e
ideology. It was his solo work, however, that established him as more than =
a
girly-voiced pop singer.

Hailed by Next Magazine as an "anti-folk genius," Dan's songs of frustratio=
n
and fear provided a welcome change to the vacuous vamping found in most
"queer art." His performance art, too, has attracted the attention of
intellectual young homos thirsty for thoughtful discourse. Ironic without
being nihilistic, passionate without being annoying, Dan writes outside of
and against consumerist mainstream gay culture.

His debut album, SWEET CHASTITY, is a frantic, schizophrenic exploration of
virginity in a culture that commodifies the human body. From the twisted
electro-pulse of the title track to the Carpenters-esque croon of "Kiss and
Tell," SWEET CHASTITY blends at least a dozen musical genres into an
anti-pop mission statement of bitter wit and seething optimism.

You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll break up with your boyfriend.

*Randi Russo

Mixing indie rock, New York garage rock, and singer/songwriter
sensibilities, Randi Russo has drawn comparisons to fellow New Yorkers Patt=
i
Smith, the Velvet Underground, and Sonic Youth for her chaotic and pensive
songwriting.

Growing up in Long Island, Russo briefly flirted with the violin, piano, an=
d
amateur turntable scratching until her early adolescence. Concentrating on
visual arts in her teens, she eventually went on to study painting in St.
Louis, where she began to fully explore the indie rock, grunge, and punk of
the early '90s while working at a college radio station. Purchasing an
electric guitar at the age of 19, the left-handed Russo found playing
right-handed unsatisfactory, eventually playing left-handed but keeping the
instrument strung the same as if it were being played right-handed. This
technique created a distinctive form of chording and riffing, and Russo soo=
n
formed her first band with a bassist and a percussionist under the guise of
Raizel. The trio recorded one single but disbanded in 1996, leaving Russo t=
o
hone her craft in relative seclusion until she emerged as a solo artist
following her return to New York City in 1999.

After about a year on the solo circuit, Russo formed a band and recorded an
admittedly chaotic live EP that captured only their second show with Live a=
t
CBGB's 313 Gallery. Following being approached by Olive Juice Records, Russ=
o
entered the studio to record her debut, 2001's intensely focused Solar
Bipolar. Although it was released at roughly the same time other New York
garage-influenced bands were again rising to prominence, Russo and her band
stood out from the pack as the vehicle of a tough-minded female
singer/songwriter and successfully avoided being categorized as a bandwagon
jumper. -- The All Music Guide

*Dream Bitches

dream bitches (pl. n): Yoko Kikuchi and Ann Zakaluk (oftentimes with an
extended family) tinker with the boundaries of what it means to be friends,
take trips, have boyfriends and lead parallel lives, while dreaming up a
landscape of densely crafted lyrics, rock guitars, and smart harmonies.

*The Domestics

During a brief stint as an A&R assistant, Alina Moscovitz (ex-Bionic Finger=
)
spent her days listening to piles of less-than-stellar demos. She decided
she could do better, so she left the corporate world and returned to
songwriting. She then hooked up with music supervisor and drummer Eric Shaw
(fresh from the break-up of Conquistador which featured Sam Endicott of The
Bravery). They soon lured Evan Silverman (ex-Rosenbergs) away from his jazz
bass lessons in Paris and gigs at the Rainbow Room back to the world of
rock. All that was missing now was crazy lead guitar energy. Thankfully,
they found it in playwright Todd Carlstrom who was last seen writing in
blank verse about women giving birth to rabbits. Finally, The Domestics
line-up was complete.

As a quartet, The Domestics morphed into a potent combination of blazing
pop-punk energy, sickeningly catchy hooks, and lyrics that have a sharp wit
and intelligence seldom heard inside of a three-minute song. If Debbie Harr=
y
shoved her way onstage during a Green Day show, the result might sound
something like this.

Besides constantly playing live shows, the Brooklyn-based band wrote the
closing credits song, "Girl I Never Kissed" for the film The D Word,
"Anorexic Love Song" appears on the X-Girls DVD and "Fire Hazard" was
included in the "Say It Don't Spray It" compilation CD packaged with the
Warped Tour DVD. The band has participated in MEANY Fest, International Pop
Overthrow and LadyfestEast festivals. The Domestics are currently recording
a full-length album for release in Fall 2005.

*Schwervon

Only a couple months into their coupledom, Major Matt Mason and Nan Turner
began jamming. Nan's prior music experience was playing guitar and sometime=
s
bass in the all-girl punky pop band Bionic Finger. Matt's experience
included playing guitar in noisepop bands in Kansas, but he was mainly doin=
g
solo acoustic shows in New York when he met Nan. In the honeymoon of their
romance, Matt brought his electric guitar out of hibernation and Nan starte=
d
banging the drums. Schwervon! was born. Their first album was called Quick
Frozen Small Yellow Cracker, named after a mysteriously labeled box in the
hallway of their NYC apartment. This cd solidified their sound as a "Sonny
and Cher meets the Pixies" garage rock couple who who weren't afraid to get
down to their dirty truths.... and let you into their living room with
ruminations on love, food, money, and their urban surroundings. Their secon=
d
cd, titled Poseur, found them kicking up the volume and production a notch,
tinging their songs with some psychedelic frustration, while continuing to
hone their bittersweet "Who's Araid of Virginia Woolf " pop narratives. The=
y
are currently working on a new cd.
    =A0
*The Trouble Dolls

The Trouble Dolls' roots go back to Kudzu, the cowpunk band formed by singe=
r
Cheri Leone and guitarist Matty Karas in 1986, when both were attending hig=
h
school in Huntington Beach, Calif. Three months after their formation, they
recorded a demo in the garage studio of reclusive pop genius Emitt Rhodes
and sent it to legendary KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer ("Rodney on the ROQ").

Rodney fell in love with the tape, becoming one of Kudzu's first and bigges=
t
supporters. One song from the demo, "Death Valley Girl," was Rodney's
most-requested song for three weeks running -- managing to hold off the
Bangles and the reunited Monkees. The song subsequently appeared on the
Frontier Records compilation Thangs That Twang.

In 1988, Kudzu toured up and down the West Coast as the opening act for Ran=
k
and File. Later that year, following an appearance on MTV's "The Cutting
Edge," they signed to Restless Records. Their Ray Manzarek-produced debut
album, California Scheming, came out in 1989, but few copies made it into
stores, due to the financial difficulties Restless was undergoing at the
time. However, the album did not escape the watchful eyes of lawyers for
United Features Syndicate, which syndicated John Neale's comic strip
"Kudzu." They promptly issued a cease-and-desist order, effectively putting
the last nail in the album's coffin.

Although Kudzu had in fact taken their name not from the strip, but from th=
e
Georgia weed depicted on the cover of R.E.M.'s Murmur, they decided that,
rather than fight, they would call it a day. Matty and Cheri moved to New
York City at the suggestion of a former schoolmate who offered them work
writing and recording music for the Cartoon Network. However, the work
proved to be something less than steady, and the pair separated for a time
to pursue "real world" careers. Cheri studied film at New York University
--while there, she directed the Gutterball video "Trial Separation Blues" -=
-
while Matty became the pop music critic for the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press.

In the summer of 1995, Matty and Cheri reunited to form the Trouble Dolls
with guitarist Michael Taylor, a New Jerseyan who was in an early version o=
f
Monster Magnet but was unceremoniously fired when he refused to learn any
more Hawkwind songs. Michael provided the band's name after discovering
trouble dolls, a Latin American charm, on a trip to Guatemala; but he left
the band in 1998 to pursue a career in television (Trekkies will recognize
him as the writer of some of the best episodes of "Star Trek: Voyager"; the=
y
will also probably be angry at us for calling them Trekkies).

For the first two years of the Trouble Dolls' existence, they were solely a
studio group, recording soundtracks for spaghetti-westerns-that-never-were
on Matty's cranky four-track and making up bios about themselves that
seamlessly blended fact and fiction (a practice which continues to this
day). One of their bargain-basement epics found its way to the BMX Bandits,
who covered the Trouble Dolls' "Love Isn't for the Lazy" on the B-side of a
fan club 45. Another track, "Planet Robin," found its way onto the
soundtrack of the 1996 indie film "Ed's Next Move". Still another, "Ice
Cream Cow," reached WFMU DJs Belinda and Hova, who continue to play it on
their Saturday morning show "Greasy Kid Stuff."

On their way to becoming a proper band, the Trouble Dolls recruited Gabe
Rhodes, a filmmaker and one-time member of the San Francisco band Scenic
Vermont, to play drums after he moved to New York in early 2001. Later that
year, they met Pam Weis while sharing a bill with her band, Bionic Finger,
at the Ladyfest East festival. When Bionic Finger broke up shortly
afterward, Pam became the Trouble Dolls' bassist.

The Trouble Dolls play their aphasic melange of prepackaged, post-Madonna
chanson and bubblegum at New York City clubs such as Luna Lounge, Arlene
Grocery and the Sidewalk Cafe. Their (they can't believe it's their first)
EP, I Don't Know Anything at All, was released in June 2002 on their own
label, La La La Unlimited, and their debut album will follow later in 2002.
They also recently completed the score for the Tony Daniel-directed indie
film "Ame rican Bohemian," in which Matty and Cheri have (totally out of
character!) cameos as musicians who wear silly clothes and smoke.

*Limp Richard

Limp Richard needs no introduction whatsoever, considering his work with hi=
s
seminal outfit Limp Richard and The Disappointments. However, his longtime =
A
& R rep/art therapist has recommended that he try to work some things out
alone, leading to his current style, which Carter Buddlesby of the Entirely
Fictional Times would refer to as "a demented alloy of Sonic Youth and
Michael Penn" if he, in fact existed. Limp is also known by his alter ego,
Todd Carlstrom, who plays lead guitar for The Domestics and writes and
produces theatre with breedingground productions. Limp is managed by the
beautiful and cultivated Remorah.

*Hearth

Hearth is a black heart folk rock band from New York City. They come jangle=
d
and direct, cryptic and depressed.

Virginia natives and cousins Scott Loving and Dan Penta have been playing
together since middle school when the discovery of late-Seventies punk rock
originators gave them the confidence and the drive to start their own band.

Later, recovering from a year long habit, Dan began writing songs on an old
acoustic guitar left behind by Scott who was living in Colorado. These
compositions were minimalist and painfully personal.

Dan relocated to New York, performing alone in the cafes and bars of the
East Village and Williamsburg. A handful listened.

Among them were Kimya Dawson and Adam Green of seminal antifolk group the
Moldy Peaches. They took Dan out with them as an opening act on their first
headlining U.S. tour. On the road Dan got to know their drummer Strictly
Beats a/k/a Brent Cole.

Sometime after the tour, with a newly transplanted Scott Loving on lead
guitar and Dan Penta on rhythm guitar and vocals, Larval Organs was formed
with Brent Cole on drums and Scott Fragala on bass.

Larval Organs gained a following in New York and Brooklyn. An e.p. entitled
Schwag was released on Tuolumne Records. They toured the United Kingdom.

The band came to an abrupt end when Dan was institutionalized following a
psychotic breakdown.

After being released and spending months on Virginia couches, Dan was
invited to play a summer music festival in New York. Performing songs old
and new, he was joined by Scott Fragala on upright bass.

Over the following months the act expanded and changed. Brent was there
again locking down the backbeat. Harmonies were layered by vocalists Amy
Hills and Angela Carlucci. Scott Fragala was replaced by Scott Loving on
electric bass, making everything grounded and full. Cello was added first b=
y
Crystal Madrilejos of the Babyskins and later by Benjamin Kalb who performs
also with Regina Spektor.

They called themselves Hearth and they rose from Avenue A. They have since
taken the stage at Pianos, Sin-e, Bowery Poetry Club, and more.

Recently a three song e.p. was completed with producer Mark Christensen at
Engine Room Audio in Manhattan. The recordings are a conscious movement
towards high fidelity - too tortured and too bizarre to be pop, too tender
and too polished to be punk. Hearth continue to define their sound and
direction. They reach. The high is to play. Everything else remains.

*The Marianne Pillsburys

Maine native Marianne Pillsbury writes pop-rock songs with cleverly-crafted=
,
hook-laden melodies and brash, witty, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Released in
2004, her debut album The Wrong Marianne has received enthusiastic reviews
from The New York Times, Time Out New York, The Boston Herald and The San
Francisco Chronicle and elicited comparisons to the best work of Liz Phair,
Juliana Hatfield and Jill Sobule. The album was named a Top 12 DIY Pick in
Performing Songwriter Magazine. The song "Boo Hoo" won Best Alt/Rock Song i=
n
The Great American Song Contest 2004 and was also selected for inclusion on
ROCKRGRL magazine's Discoveries 2005 compilation CD.

Her Brooklyn-based band The Marianne Pillsburys bring Marianne's songs to
life with a raw punk-pop vibe. Think: Blondie, Elastica, Liz Phair fronting
The Rolling Stones, or Juliana Hatfield singing lead for The Pixies. The
band has played NYC venues like Mercury Lounge, Luna Lounge, Pianos,
Arlene's Grocery and Southpaw, out-of-town venues in Boston, DC, LA and San
Francisco, and festivals like M.E.A.N.Y. Fest (Musicians & Emerging Artists
in New York), International Pop Overthrow and the Millenium Music
Conference.

In April 2005, the band released a 3-song demo called "The Hot EP" produced
by the fabulously talented Roger Greenawalt (Ben Kweller, Ben Lee).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEET THE BAND:

Sandy Brockwell (bass & backing vox) Hailing from the grande state of Tejas=
,
Sandy B. Rock-well certainly lives up to her name. Besides rocking well, he=
r
interests include surfing, horror movies, economics and tequila.

Mitch Distefano (lead guitar & backing vox) Mitch enjoys his role as the
whipping boy of the band. Being a Brooklyn native, he can of course hold hi=
s
own. In addition to being a rock star guitarist, he also gives rock star
guitar lessons.

Dawn McGrath (drums) Queens native Dawn (pronounced "dwon") has earned her
black belt in drumming by eating, breathing and sleeping drums while
surrounded by her 700 bald Cabbage Patch Kids.

*Chris Maher

Meet Chris Maher (pronounced mar): A 24 year-old songwriter from New York
City, wise beyond his years and schooled below his wise, proud and
protective of the tricks up his sleeve.=A0 His music is oft an exercise in
contradiction: Neurotic and savvy, country and city, wry and idealistic.
He=B9s a deft adjuster but his fear of pigeonholes has been his pitfall =AD
to-date, he has only one =8Creleased=B9 song to his credit.
=A0
Although Chris has been playing around NYC since the not-so-tender age of
15, he=B9s always felt most comfortable on the fence, never content to limit
himself to any one particular musical community. Back in 2000, when first
crashing the Lower East Side=B9s love-it-or-detest-it Antifolk scene, Chris
was busy playing bass for hip-hop band Automato as they were writing their
DFA-produced debut=A0 - what else to do when Woody and Wu Tang make equal
sense?=A0 These days, he=B9s playing a variety of instruments in a variety of
bands and has played shows (on his own) alongside a smorgasbord of fellow
writers like Mirah, Nellie McKay, the Dirty Projectors, Mike Doughty and
Mount Eerie. This past summer, Chris embarked on his first West Coast tour,
opening for the mighty AFNY-ers Jeffrey and Jack Lewis and Kimya Dawson.
=A0
Although the only currently-available Maher-penned song appears on the debu=
t
7-inch by The Morningsides - a two-song single recorded by Walter Martin of
The Walkmen - new Chris Maher compositions are finally ready for release:
=B3Ungrown Flowers=B2 will be featured on a compilation from Seattle=B9s
Baskerville Hill label, Married Media will release a video for a new
recording of =B3mE=3Dmc(squared)=B2 and New York=B9s Recommended If You Like Record=
s
will release Chris=B9 debut album, Epigram on the Death of a Feeling =AD a
collection of songs that recall the verbose bitterness of Songs of Love and
Hate-era Leonard Cohen, the restrained tenderness of Being There-era Wilco
and the aggressive melodicism of Let It Be-era Replacements.
=A0
In late-2005, Chris will tour from New York to California with Sonya Cotton
and plans to embark on a full-scale national tour upon the release of
Epigram... Chris will also further indulge his eclectic tendencies by
recording an EP of material as Volumes, with members of The Fugue, and a
single with his lap-pop project, Trouble Tape!

*Genan Zilkha

Genan Zilkha, guitar/vocals, was a classically trained pianist until she
found that she had a taste of rock and roll.  Since that didn't work out,
she now spends her time writing folk songs with titles such as "I Think I
Might Be Food Poisoning (But it could also be love)" and "I Know What Will
Make You Not A Dyke".  Genan is also known for her unique takes on Britney
Spears songs, in particular her version of Britney's Version of "My
Prerogative".  She has performed at  the Knitting Factory, as well as at
venues throughout Rhode Island and Binghamton, NY.

SCHABLONE BERLIN  =20
by Caroline Koebel and Kyle Schlesinger

Schablone Berlin is an artists=B9 book as well as a book of documentation
presenting stencil graffiti from the streets of Germany=B9s most internationa=
l
metropolis. The book consists of over 100 color photographs showing not onl=
y
the graffiti, but also its placement within the confines of urban space. Th=
e
40-page introduction examines the political, semiotic and performative
aspects of stencils as a political/populist form of writing with reference
to histories of art, media and urban anthropology. The Post-Face was writte=
n
by anthropologist and translator Dennis Tedlock.

"This art and text project by Caroline Koebel and Kyle Schlesinger is a
loving drift through the streets of Berlin to examine and to be inspired by
its raw, lively, lustful, sometimes esoteric stencil culture. Exquisitely
photographed, this work plays in the in betweens of poetics and politics,
the trivial and the insightful, the amusing and the disturbing, the
immediate and the aloof. One way or another, this book will seduce you."

 =B3Contemporary trackers on the trail of an esoteric species, Koebel and
Schlesinger have captured a gallery of transitory signs from the surface of
Berlin's walls. The very sign of urbanism, these swiftly made images depend
on a community of knowing readers to recognize their codes, nod, and signal
back across the space of time and geography. The city is the site, scene, o=
f
a whole system of traces and communications. The marks show their
ephemerality and questionable legality in the very stealth mode of their
production. Stenciled, spray painted, rapidly produced, they haunt the wall=
s
with their fading imagery, semaphore signals in a common but
still-specialized system, introducing their alternative image-speak into th=
e
regulated zones of public discourse. A beautiful collection, thoughtfully
framed by its introduction.=B2     =8BJohanna Drucker

I just wanted to put out a wrap-up to the homolinguistic holiday cards
project for everyone who didn't have a chance to participate.

The short version is: it was awesome, and everyone who didn't
participate really missed out.

But, for the record, the participants were:

Bob Marcacci
Catherine Daly
Christophe Casamassima
Dan Waber
David Baratier
endwar
Geof Huth
Grace Vajda
Irving Weiss
Jennifer Hill-Kaucher
John M. Bennett
Laura Goldstein
Marton Koppany
mIEKAL aND
Pamela Grossman
Peter Ganick
Sheila Murphy

These 17 poets combined to contribute 27 translations. I would share
them with you, but, the point and the promise of the project was you
have to play to win, so, sorry. There's always next year.

But, as a consolation prize, you can see the full array of them as
they are displayed in the studio of Paper Kite Press, along with a
picture of our decorated poetree (words for ornaments), the poetry
cash register (visitors chose five words from the register and handed
them to poets who composed poems for them on the spot which used those
words), and the trays of word'ouvres (poems folded origami-style) that
were passed on silver trays to visitors this past weekend during Arts
Madness at the Mansion (the studio is in the old Stegmeier family
mansion).

Please join us during the MLA for the third and final in our series of multi-poet extravaganzas -- the DC poets
at the District of Columbia Arts Center in Adams Morgan.

Thurday December 29th at 8 PM

DCPoetry presents

Jean Donnelly
Buck Downs
Cathy Eisenhower
Heather Fuller
Lorraine Graham
Dan Gutstein
Chris Nealon
Mel Nichols
Tom Orange
Phyllis Rosenzweig
Jessica Smith
Rod Smith
Ward Tietz
Ryan Walker
Mark Wallace

This event immediately follows the Mom Poets discussion list event.

Also, currently showing in the DCAC gallery, Buck Downs' show "In Memory D Thompson" -- "A series of visual
poems created by rubbing words from the names and related inscriptions found on headstones in historic
Congressional Cemetery, Washington DC. Equal parts ghost story and concrete poem, each sequence teases out
a mysterious syntax buried in the names of the dead."

The DC Arts Center is located at 2438 18th Street NW, just south of Columbia Road in the heart of the Adams
Morgan neighborhood, a short cab ride or walk from MLA convention hotels.

Diane DiPrima kindly forward this lovely Carl Sandburg solstice poem:

One arch of the sky
Took on a spray of jewels.

The crystals gleamed on the windows
Weaving their wintrish alphabets
Of spears and ovals fixed in frost
Fastened to a glass design
With a word: This must be.

There are shooters of the moon far north.
There are dying eyes holding diadems.
There are deaths sweet as laughing waters,
There are gold heelprints on the fading
            staircases of the stars.

Happy Solstice, all -

Happy Holidays & much thanks from all of us here
at Lungfull Magazine World Headquarters.

Using the standard units of poetry event measure,
and even by some other more tangible benchmarks,
our release party was a tremendous success
for which we thank you & encourage you to
gaze at your own radiant face as it appears
at www.lungfull.org

Over 160 pictures from that evening and well over
1,000 for events this past season at zinc & battle hill
await your discerning eye. Also a glimpse of the new issue...

www.lungfull.org

Once there, you can also get a subscription
-- and help the striking NYC transit workers --
$2 from every new subscription will be donated to
the workers & their families to help them get through this.

It may harsh our mellow as we struggle to get to work,
but the men & women who run our subways & busses
are hurting even more. As much as it's easy to blame
them for their response to the MTA's unwillingness
to let them have a raise, access to healthcare & a real
pension, as easy as it is to believe our mayor &
governor when they say the MTA is being fair, the facts
fall undeniably on the side of the working stiffs.

For example, the MTA wants to raise the retirement age
from 55 to 62. Seems reasonable -- until you consider
the median age of death for a transit worker is 57.

The MTA is offering a 3% raise this year -- again seems
reasonable until you subtract the additional 2%
they are demanding workers pay for health insurance...
and 6% they want them to pay into the pension plan.
So really the workers are looking at a 5% reduction
in wages in the first year of the new contract.

The MTA is the same organization that raised fares
not long ago while hiding a surplus in the hundreds
of millions of dollars.  Now that surplus exceeds
one billion dollars and MTA Chair Peter Kalikow,
who's personal net worth is estimated to match
the MTA's surplus, is crying poverty.

The workers may be the easy target of all our anger,
but they're not the right targets & if they manage to
win their fight, they'll be helping us all out by
raising the standard for what kind of treatment &
compensation are considered acceptable.

I hope to see you around this holiday season...
one way or another!

on the hoof,
Brendan Lorber

I respectfully submit this:

This psychological pedomorphosis--the psychological retention
of juvenile traits--it perhaps best blamed on not any one
decade or group, but on the fact that we no longer have to
worry about, say, being eaten by a big cat on the African
savannah.  There's a reason why many of the first world
cultishly believe that indigenous people's are spiritually
mature and wisdom-filled (look to the America 60s); these
folks live closer to our origins and are not domesticated by
socialism or capitalism or what have you.  Many still use
harsh rites to mark the change to adulthood--a psycho-somatic
break from being a juvenile.  I'm no starry-eyed new-ageist
(as Terence McKenna once said, "The New Age is a Maya or Egypt
for menopausal theosophists") or romanticist of the
"primitive" people, don't get me wrong--I don't think we all
need to start cutting our own foreskins off at age thirteen
with a stone.  But remember that some of the most repressive
political movements (the Chinese Cultural Revolution; the
"Free Love" Movement of the American 60s--yes, it was a
repressive male-oriented orgiastic pipe-dream) were run by
teens...  What I'm talking about runs deeper than the idea
that, well, an adolescent society is a better alternative to a
"middle-aged/complacent" society.  Pedomorphic traits are in
fact traits born out of complacency; Punk was born out of an
economic depression in which people did in fact have to worry
about surviving (watch the famous Sex Pistols interview with
Bill Grundy--who's the egregious teen making sexual innuendo?
 the "old geezer," not Rotten) and so should be considered a
reaction *against* domesticated teen-traited society.  What
I'm talking about is a society for whom _Sex in the City_ is a
collective dream.  Bummer.

Yours,

hi, brendan! thanks for this--an important and useful set of stats. i had never heard the "median age of death" figure for transit workers. where did you find it? seems to me, it's at least as important to figure out why their median age of death is so much lower than the norm and address those causes as it to resolve anything else.

glad the lungfull release was a success. i knew it would be. i was under the weather, overscheduled, and entertaining an out-of-town guest--but i'm glad all was swell.

off to struggle to get to work, again (the only one in my department who's been making it in--and then getting slammed with everyone's assignments)--pam

I think Ian was suggesting that old age doesn't look so great. It doesn't
look any better as one gets closer to it. As to the rest, you really ought
to read some anthropology. And maybe some history--even our own societies
have from the beginning made large spaces for fun--think of carnivals, for
instance.

If the median age of death for poets is 19, how are we still here?  Is this some veiled reference to Rimbaud who, of course, stopped writing at 19 and became a gunrunner and died in his thirties.  Should we take up gunrunning in order to prolong our lives? I think not.  And yes, fortunately, the transit strike is over.

  Chris,

  I want to second you in your discomfort with all the new technologies  (not all of them all that new--the computer industry's most recent  innovations have mostly been in pr).  As someone who is trying to  convert vinyl into .mp3s--because, dears, there is music not in that  most holy of formats--I get irritated by how much technology gets in  the way of doing  things.  I could start a rant about a certain software company,  but I won't.  And I really like wiki.  It just seems really  cool, though it really is for consensus based documents (i.e. like a  Constitution) and not creative and/or polemic ones (i.e. a  Manifesto).

  But I do find myself, contrarily, behind the curve on some of these  changes.  I do not have a .mp3 player.  I don't really see  the sense in downloading music, except for the purposes of  archiving.  And it goes further.  I am wondering whether  others on the list think that suspicion of technology in this sense is  gendered male, in some sense.  I am not sure, but I don't believe  I have ever met a woman who took offense at changes in  technology.  And by this I don't mean, didn't change their  ways.  I mean was snarky about it.   Perhaps I am wrong,  but it's my sense that certain curmudgeonly attitudes about  technology--which I have by the way--are male attitudes, by and large.

  Agree?  Disagree?

It's still confusing to me, but it just takes a while for these things to
sink in (learn by doing, etc). So, thank you for your continued patience
with me on this---

In other news, I can't even make mix-tapes for friends anymore coz everybody
does the CD-burn thing. I know I shouldn't waste energy complaining about
all this stuff, but sometimes I wonder if it's not accidental that
1) the rise of "attention deficit syndrome" parallels the rise of various
   new technologies in the 90s and 00s
2) a kind of cultural malaise in terms of creativity that many people feel
   in many of the arts (and entertainment 'fields') doesn't somehow relate
to the acceleration of having to learn new tricks technologically just to
not "fall behind" and be "invited to the table"

   the computer people take more than just money off of us...?

    Just wonderin'

Farewell Tookie: Food For Thought Is Better Than A Meal
By KRS-One

“They killed the teacher!” said Snoop Dogg at the funeral services for
Stanley Tookie Williams December 20 at the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Los
Angeles. Rev. Jesse Jackson, Bruce Gordon, Minister Tony Muhammad, Stan
Muhammad, Rev. Dr. Lewis E. Logan II, Minister Lewis Farrakhan and Tony
Robbins all listened as Snoop Dogg brought the packed Church to its feet
with a poem dedicated to Tookie entitled “Till We Meet Again.” One line
that caught my attention was when Snoop said, “Food for thought is
better than a meal.” This phrase stuck with me, because it reminded me
of man may not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth
from the mouth of the lord and coming from Snoop showed a level of
maturity that I wish his Girls Gone Wild, pimps-up-hoes-down, gangsta
nigga audiences would adopt.

And I am NOT being critical of Snoop at all! I’ve been watching Snoop
settle his beefs with others, start programs in the hood for at-risk
youth, seek God and denounce gang-banging publicly. But this is my
point. When has a man done enough to be called rehabilitated? What must
one do to be actually free from past wrongs? When is a man truly forgiven?

I arrived at the Bethel A.M.E. Church to a beautiful scene. Several
blocks before we got to the Church helpful, pleasantly spoken,
informative Black and Brown police officers were stationed at strategic
corners directing traffic toward the Church. When we arrived at the
Church we were greeted by the Fruit of Islam (F.O.I.) and escorted to
the press balcony. There was literally nowhere else to be. Even members
of Stanley Tookie Williams’ family were in the press balcony! When this
was discovered, Rev. Dr. Logan II requested that the first ten rows of
people give up their seats to these additional members of the Williams
family and everyone promptly did what was asked.

The Church was so packed that many people were in another room outside
of the main knave watching the proceedings on a huge flat screen
television. When I walked into this room I saw Tookie on the screen
saying, “If a man must fight, let it be to the death against the beast
within himself. Win that battle? No man, no woman, no racial hatred, no
system, no vindictiveness, and no Machiavellianism can ever defeat you!
And then he said on behalf of the children; teach them how to avoid our
destructive foot steps. Teach them to strive for a higher education.
Teach them to promote peace. And teach them to focus on rebuilding the
neighborhoods that you, others and I helped to destroy.” And I can’t
front, I was renewed even in my own spirit. To know that one of the most
significant outlaw figures in modern American history went from criminal
minded to spiritual minded gives all of us (especially those on the
frontlines of ministry work, counseling, mentoring and rehabilitation
work) hope in the transformation of the human heart. That our work is
not done in vain.

I was totally impressed with the organization and security of the F.O.I.
Hundreds of people was jammed in the Church with even more people
outside trying to get in yet the Church and the whole block itself
(Western Ave) was at peace. It was beautiful.

But as beautiful as it was, the Church was still teeming with suspicion
as to why a completely rehabilitated man could not be offered at least
life in prison? How was Tookie (the co-founder of the famous street gang
the Crips) who spent 24 years in prison, wrote nine anti-violence,
anti-gang, anti-drug children’s books, received an honorary Doctor of
Humane Letters degree from St. Moses the Black Theological Seminary, was
nominated six times for the Nobel Peace Prize, and received the
Presidential Call to Service Award from President George W. Bush for his
volunteer efforts to help steer youth away from gang life not
rehabilitated? There’s even an award-winning movie starring Jamie Foxx
entitled “Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story” that teaches the
path of rehabilitation and forgiveness. All of this, in addition to his
website and phone mentoring of young people from prison, and let us not
forget his plea of innocence, could not have granted this man a stay of
execution. He had to die? He was that dangerous to society? Well, no one
at the funeral thought so.

“Tookie is dead,” said Rev. Jesse Jackson. “We must kill the idea of
killing to stop killing.” Remembering his own prayer time with Tookie,
Rev. Jackson quoted Tookie saying, “I admit I was a predator upon my
people. We were programmed to attack Black people. Whites were safe
around us; I will not be killed for what I did do, but for what I didn’t
do. I’d rather die than lie to get clemency.” And the whole Church
erupted in applause and cheering! It was like they were ALL used to this
process of having to lie along with the police and the District Attorney
in hopes of achieving lighter sentences or no jail time at all and
Tookie represented that person that never snitched or sold out to the
corruption of the Judicial system. I’d rather die than lie for clemency
seemed to resonate with everyone there dealing with an already proven to
be corrupt California corrections/prison system.

As Rev. Jesse Jackson brought to mind the fact that Charles Manson who
is responsible for killing pregnant Sharon Tate and seven others is
still alive in California on death row and that President John F.
Kennedy’s assassin is also still alive, I was reading some of Tookie’s
own words of transformation in a booklet that was being handed out
throughout the Church. One paragraph read, “Its impossible for a
discriminable mind to fathom the miraculous transition of a redeemed
soul. Contrary to the popular misconception, redemption is not a
biblical ethos, exclusive to saints, prophets, elitists or the
holier-than-thou. It is of earthly accessibility through human
initiative. I aver that the process of being redeemed is available to
any individual regardless of gender, race, color, creed, social stratum
or background. Yes, even a wretched Black man, akin to the former me,
can transform and be redeemed.

As I read this, I couldn’t help asking myself over and over again, did
Tookie have to die? Did Tookie have to die? Did Stan Tookie Williams
really have to die? Son, husband, father of two, grandfather of three,
minister, changed man. Was there no other way to pay that debt back to
society other than the execution of a transformed man who held on to his
claim of innocence all the way to the end? Tookie had to die? I don’t
think so. However, I find myself at a peculiar crossroad in American
history. First of all, it should be clear to all that the title
Department of Corrections is false. No one entering the prison
industrial complex is being rehabilitated or rather corrected. With
Tookie’s death it seems that no matter what you do to correct your past
errors, the American justice system will still show you no mercy. Once a
criminal, always a criminal.

Secondly, the idea of an Austrian born White man using the American
legal system to murder a Louisiana born Black man just doesn’t sit well
with me. And I am not being selective or even prejudice here. But does
Governor Schwarzenegger really know enough about American history, even
African American history to have made a just decision on Stanley Tookie
Williams’ life? Does Governor Schwarzenegger care anything about the
message he is sending throughout the African American community,
especially to African American youths? Stanley Tookie Williams’ murder
by the State also proves the powerlessness of the African American
community and its leadership. But I won’t get into that here.

Finally. In a time when Americas State and Federal agencies are being
severely criticized for their seeming lack of care for the suffering of
African Americans in wake of Hurricane Katrina, Governor Schwarzenegger
missed an important opportunity to restore African American hope in the
Department of Corrections and America as a whole. While African
Americans are dying by the dozen in Iraq, Tookie’s execution by the same
regime African Americans are defending seems a little hypocritical
justice wise. In a time of so much racial disunity and mass American
despair due to mass unemployment, now might not be a good time for
Americans to be murdering Americans legally or illegally. Governor
Schwarzenegger could have set a new precedent for our time as Americans
by turning away from violence and granting Stanley Tookie Williams
clemency. But that’s all over now. Violence wins again! Or did it?

Tookie admitted his wrongs and paid the price of total transformation.
Before his execution he talked a lot about being redeemed, meaning to
recover ownership of something by paying a specified sum for it. In a
spiritual sense, meaning to restore to wholeness, to be saved from a
sinful state of being, to return to honor and self-worth, to be free
from guilt. In his last moments on earth Tookie wrote, “Here and now, I
bear witness that God’s bequest of redemption has replenished me with a
mission and revealed that the impossible is possible.” This is a strong
affirmation for us today.

Stan Tookie Williams was murdered by the State of California on December
13, 2005. We will miss you, teacher.

Robert---

thanks for writing. I probably have at one time or another also thrown out
the possible linkage between gender and technology suspician---

it's definitely an idea worth exploring, and would, I think, relate to a LOT
of other developments in the last 15-25 years

At present, I tend to feel it's more of generational (but not in the sense
that one 55 year old, or even 100 55 year olds, who love the new
technologies, could prove me wrong)---and also relating to class.

On a basic level, when you're 10 and it's clear IPODS, etc, are the
rules, the ticket, what have you, and you never learned the older
technologies, well, it doesn't come off as much of a time-wasting,
money-wasting hassle....

Funny, how it used to be, "oh the young kids, they make too much noise
or are too wild" ---whether it was the Bing Crosby parents reacting to their
kids on Sinatra, or the Sinatra parents with their British Invasion kids
or the hippie parents with their punk kids...."

Now, it's more about modes of technology

As typewriters and turntables and toaster ovens
whine on the isle of misfit toys....

awaiting the foggy xmas eve or "second coming"
blah-di-blah....

basically, i can't criticize ANYBODy for doing it---

and may HAVE to do it myself someday real soon...

but I should've responded to ZERVOS' email a while back
about the IPOD heralding the return of the single....

I mean, I can see that point in a way
but it still falls short of the sense of public space
if taken by itself

Of course, it does seem it might be helping marginalize
the impact of MTV as one form of large scale corporate arbitration,

but the point is the INDIE labels, the musician with little
or no money to spend on promotion, has been at a huge disadvantage
under both the regime of MTV and the regime of the IPOD

and this wasn't as true in the golden era of the 45RPM single
(not that there was ever a level playing field, but it was closer....)

Most commonly. Sometimes people download music to remix it, but they've
usually listened to it first.

Mark Weiss states:  I think Ian was suggesting that old age
doesn't look so great. It doesn't look any better as one gets
closer to it. As to the rest, you really ought to read some
anthropology. And maybe some history--even our own societies
have from the beginning made large spaces for fun--think of
carnivals, for instance.

Mr Weiss

At the risk of sounding bitchy:  This equation between
adolescence and "fun" and "old age" and "no fun" is
problematic--and something I never addressed--and, what I've
adressed *is* anthropological and historical, by the by.  I've
read athropology and history, thank you very much--and perhaps
the greatest book on play and "fun," _Homo Ludens_ by Johan
Huizinga.  Perhaps you should read some biology.

perhaps as a kind of antidote to the techno blues...

as a kind of illustration of lingering on, i recommend some fine music by
britain's vicki bennett at
http://vispo.com/temp/People-Like-Us-Playlist.M3U (streaming) or
http://www.ubu.com/sound/plu_abridged.html (non streaming but contains text
on the music) or http://www.peoplelikeus.org (bennett's site).

the first two links (the same music) concern an album of bennett's called
Abridged Too Far (2004) published on ubu.com. i'm very fond of this. she's
taken music from europe and the americas from the 1920s through to the 1990s
and mixed it together with great skill but, more than skill, often a tuneful
originality that i haven't really heard before. even in, say, john oswald's
plunderphonics...the concept and technique are of course strongly related,
but bennett's sound is extrordinarily tuneful whereas oswald's work is doing
something else. and of course bennett's work is more recent than oswald's
plunderphonics, which means that the editing tools have greater
resolution/accuracy.

anyway, the music bennett uses is, for the most part, way pre-digital though
she's using editing tools that would make life very much harder for her were
they not digital, and the overall sound could not really be associated with
pre-digital though the samples are quite old.

i linger over this music often and with pleasure. history synthaesizer. but
also surely some finely original contemporary music.

ja
http://vispo.com

ps: was listening to some ccr this morning also, particularly the screeching
guitar work from various songs. many of those pieces from different songs
could be put together productively. but it's something else to use a palette
as large as bennett's.

A new interview just in time for the holidays!  A few lovely tunes are very included -- I hope you all enjoy:


  Boxers or briefs?  Bob Dylan or the Flaming Lips?  This interview touches on topics so varied, you'll drink up now and wonder later how you can get in on Akron/Family's sweet and buoyant sounds.  We traverse rough-hewn days in a hot-ass Brooklyn loft to sold-out shows in New York City's finest indie venues.  The landscape is speckled with talk of collaboration and mortared by banter on poetry and song-writing methods.  These guys have only just begun, and I feel privileged to have gotten a glimpse into the inner-workings of a band-in-progress.   They are bettering and bettering … with an eye out for you.

I am simply commenting that downloading music is  not the most intuitive way to listen to it, to me, particularly new  music.   Better the radio, the club, and the music  store.  Downloading music, even when I did do it, was about  searching for tracks that I knew of  but couldn't find or didn't  want the whole album.  And that was primarily to make mix  CDs.

  I have found that, like a lot of computer applications to culture, what  first seems like an interesting and perhaps more  instant-gratification-y delivery system turns into a way of getting  work at less than the best quality, in usually fairly fragile  formats--CD-Rs like minidisks have a disturbing habit of breaking down  quite quickly.  To avoid all these problems, then, requires an  investment in capital, which doesn't guarantee that you can preserve  the music, as you can with a vinyl record (and so far, CDs), since the  recording formats tend to change--the better for fidelity, of course,  but also requiring more capital for playback--or be  proprietorial.  It's a mess in other words.

  Let's look at the IPOD.  Since it is made by Apple, I think we can  have some faith that it will last and that the formats won't exclude  old players, but the machines are small and easily lost and easily  smashed.  And they have not as yet eclipsed traditional component  systems in reproductive fidelity, even less in their ability to play  different formats of recorded music.  Yet they cost as much as a  decent receiver that will last (mine has) 15 or 20 years or more.   What is the revolution here?  To me it is one in marketing and  consumer electronics, not in fidelity or even portability.

  The main thing (and the best thing) about digital applications to music  and culture more broadly is their ability to archive and extend the  reach of the library.  That is a good thing, but to herald it as  some sort of break or disruption is to ignore the fact that technology  does not and has never driven culture, except in allowing cultural  applications of new technologies.  Culture, older, based on  experience and tradition--dare I say, wisdom--handed down, always  trumps technology.  This is no different for the e-mailing list,  which to me is a virtual salon; blogs, in which everybody becomes their  editorial columnist; and wiki, which allows collective, consensus  driven documents (i.e. encyclopedias and other reference tools) to be  created without a publisher.  None of these is a new form, just  old wine in newer, shinier, cheaper bottles.  It is mistake often  made since the rise of personal computers to parrot what the marketers  and engineers would like to bel
ieve,
 that somehow a "change" has  occurred, but to me that is simply pr and the usual wankery that  happens in late capitalism about new gadgets, mostly in the service of  getting "bank."  The old rules, mostly, still apply.

Hi Robert,

I was going to respond to your analysis of iPods with a very foolish=20
comment about "the difference between tools and toys," but I was saved=20
by visiting a filmmakers' board today, where a student was talking about =

his new way of learning films: since he has given up on finding useful=20
data from Hollywood, he instead goes to school, plugs in his iPod,=20
downloads hundreds of megs in independent free film, and watches and=20
studies them at home, on that tiny screen, at his convenience. I do=20
something similar at cafes with wireless, as a fan, but I'm not trying=20
to run Premiere. He needs a desktop.

Myself, I need a CD writer and PC; I use them as tools. Free with these=20
tools comes the ability to record, for myself, an unlimited amount of=20
music. In many places, the ability to learn about new music from the=20
radio or clubs is negligible, and I simply can't afford to pay industry=20
prices for music on a regular basis. (And, yes, if Bob Dylan ever falls=20
into abject poverty as a result of my actions, rest assured I'll try to=20
help.)

That's not in argument with your points, of course. Neither the CD=20
writer's value to me nor the iPod's value to that film student=20
constitute a revolution. (The only statement you made that I would=20
object to is your dissatisfaction with CD-Rs, as I am not aware of any=20
sound recording technology, available to the public, that was=20
particularly resliant to wear.) Of course technology is a mess.=20
Technology will always be a mess, and there are always those who, as a=20
result of fetishizing technology, will enjoy that mess; namely, they=20
will enjoy their ability to acquire useless items that no one else yet=20
has. And, because of this very large and strong market, we put up with=20
many substandard products; it's likely the film student I mentioned=20
would vastly prefer an iPod that would last as long as your speaker=20
system (and I'm betting your speaker system is far more physically=20
attractive). And yes, that is infuriating. On the other hand, a few=20
decades ago, these fetishistic personalities were buying bigger and less =

efficient internal combustion engines as a manner of competing with one=20
another. I would prefer they screw up our .mp3 technology than our=20
everything.

I think we might be using different meanings of the word "culture." To=20
me, a culture and its technology is inextricable, and to refer to the=20
"wisdom" of a culture is almost tautalogical: could we generate wisdom=20
from /outside/ of our culture? And if not, are not our wisdom and our=20
technology rooted together?

Yours,

Hey Jonathan and Robert

Well, what I say isn't necessarily going to clarify anything
but rather my own ambivalence about the new technology---
my "guilty until proven, well, if not innocent, at least useful"
and, yes, for me, right now, the jury is still out.

But, even though I agree with a lot of Robert's criticisms,
I also see Jonathan's points as a consumer as well,
and since my perspective right now is more as a producer
than a consumer, I'll supplement some of J's defenses of ipod, etc
with a possible defense from the "production" side.

For a band with limited economic resources, who is more interested
in having the recordings of their songs heard than doing live shows--
i.e. who maybe is appealing to the "closet" listener, the suburban teen
who is too young to go be able to go to many of the bars where
"unestablished" acts tend to play (failing the "all ages" show,
which is usually associated with a narrower range of music),
and who, because of living with a parent or maybe two,
may have more expendable cash---
well, for these people the internet downloading
may be a very useful tool---

For as Jonathon says, for many Radio is not as vital of an option as it once
was. Even college radio tends to get a lot of its taste dictated to it
by magazines like Pitchfork---and there's a lot of places in the USA where
you can't even get college radio. And many of the bigger so-called "indie"
labels still larely operate on a kind of payola system. Sure, there's the
"local scenes" and one can definitely still reach people that way--
but again not so much the teens--and if one is interested in getting
recordings of one songs circulating, perhaps the web can be useful.
It's a slow process, and involves rethinking one's way of getting songs out
there, but to make some songs available for free downloads may still
have longterm benefits. Some indie labels are really against this
because immediate profit matters more than longterm grassroots fan-base
building, but that could be "penny wise, pound foolish" perhaps---
Well, compared to the economy of being a poet, in which one gives
away one's work for free and then is guilt-tripped into "donating"
on top of that, because "the bestest poetry doesn't have market value"
(but if you write enough of it, YOU as person will have market value)--

Anyway, compared to the "poet" economy, the getting the songs out there
through the web (and just signing up for IODA or other digital downloading
services---but actively seeking individuals through the web),
may---perhaps--be a way for a somewhat independent artist to subvert
the taste making mediators. I know I've been able to turn at least some
people in places it would be EXTREMELY expensive for me to try to TOUR
on to some of my music---places like Nebraska, Glasgow, Brazil, etc---
and even sometimes down the block. And that gives me a little hope--
if not even "beer money" as of yet--but it's still early, the jury's still
out, and I'm still searching for any means possible.

Chris

Anagrams of America | Mike Smith

Author's Note. Each of the poems in Anagrams of America is an anagram of
its source text. All of the letters of the source text have been used,
once and only once, in the composition of the corresponding poem. No
letters have been added and no letters have been left out. Many of the
sources are familiar works by familiar authors, and I have indicated below
each poem the text used. Unless otherwise indicated, titles, epigraphs,
section numbers, and section headings are not to be considered part of the
anagram.  -- MS

"Plan" is one of sixteen Anagrams of America. Start the new year early and
start it here... with Mudlark and Mike Smith, his Anagrams of America.


Plan

                               Those who write of the art of poetry
                   teach us that if we would write what may be worth
                   the reading, we ought always, before we begin, to
                   form a regular plan and design of our piece.
                                                    -- Ben Franklin

1.

To be separate, anonymous, silent,
yet not without real power or pride, say
the tact and driven mindset of software
giants, ex-hackers bailed out by the F.B.I.

Troubleshooters, key specialists
flown in to exact purpose yet no
further ado, then flown back home again.
One of the sought-after, needed, few.

2.

Bound by boundlessness, appalled
by applause, overreaching
in despair--The poet at home
in a prose nation. He weathers his vast,
unforgiven country like a storm.

3.

By jolt, by dint of play, Rex Eternity
can milk every almanac list, render moot
our daily reinvention of the sky.
Many may act. More cry out. Unnerving Time

4.

exists for our misuse. In it: loved lover
and icy stream are lost. View
the damage done in Limit's civic name.


_ The poem is an anagram of the four numbered sections
of Benjamin Franklin's "Plan for Future Conduct," Labaree et al., eds.,
The Papers of Benjamin Franklin, 40 vols. New Haven: Yale UP, 1959.

Mike Smith is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro, Hollins College, and the University of Notre Dame. His poems
have recently appeared in Carolina Quarterly, Hotel Amerika, North
American Review, Quarter After Eight, Notre Dame Review, Salt, DIAGRAM,
and Borderlands. A chapbook, SMALL INDUSTRY, is forthcoming from the South
Carolina Poetry Initiative.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Dear Readers and Friends,

In time for whichever holiday(s) you may celebrate at this time of year, we
would like to offer you a huge, free gift: Tarpaulin Sky V3n3-4
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com

Our 3rd Anniversary Issue includes poetry by Jesus Aguado (translated by
Electa Arenal and Beatrix Gates) as well as an assortment of poetry, prose,
and cross/trans-genre work Julie Carr, Jan Clausen, Josh Corey, Michael
Costello, Barbara DeCesare, Joan Fiset, Sandy Florian, Ada Limón, Paul
McCormick, Joyelle McSweeney, Amanda Nadelberg, Daniel Nester, Mark O’Neil,
Francis Raven, Andrew Roberts, Brian Torrey Scott, Laura Sims, Jeff Tapia,
Cody Walker, Joshua Marie Wilkinson, and Max Winter. Also in this issue: Tim
Roberts reviews Beth Anderson’s _Overboard_, Alexis M. Smith reviews Aimee
Bender’s _Willful Creatures_, and Amy Havel reviews Norman Lock’s _A History
of the Imagination_.

And if you’re just looking to buy tarps, we have those as well. They make
great backup shelters (though not as pretty as glass houses, they invite
fewer stones).

Here's wishing everyone the best in 2006. And we thank you for three great
years—

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Steve,

Everyday is open mic in our home.  No matter how modern or edgy my offerings,
the youngsters outnumber me with  their vast hip hop inventory. We banter and
battle for supremacy, theirs being  the most intense and obvious rhythm and
rhyme, mine being an appeal to the  subtle and milder forms. The most common
phrase or euphemism brings to mind a  song or poem. If they like my old school
expressions, I can educate them with a  little history. If not, well, they have
almost full reign to be disrespectful of  me, their elder. They listen; and a
few of them write their own. Rebels with  heart and a love for words. What
more could a parent ask for?

Mary

Alfred Leslie's superb 1960 one-shot magazine THE HASTY PAPERS is back
in a 2005 hardcover actual-size reprint edition prefaced by all sorts of
wonderful documentation of the original project -- facsimiles of cards,
letters, notes from the likes of Marcel Duchamp, Samuel Beckett, Jean
Cocteau, James Schuyler, Truman Capote, Terry Southern, Frank O'Hara, Leroi
Jones, Lionel Trilling, Bertrand Russell, Marianne Moore, Boris Pasternak,
Robert Lowell, Robert Creeley et alia. "PERHAPS NOW YOU WILL PAY ME THE
MONEY YOU OWE ME," writes Duchamp, the capper to a work only the
unappeasable Alfred could provoke. Actual contributors include Gregory
Corso, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, William Carlos Williams, O'Hara, Donald
Windham, Peter Orlovsky, Schuyler, Barbara Guest, Allen Ginsberg, Morton
Feldman, Jean-Paul Sartre, Kerouac, Genet, Charles Olson, Fidel Castro,
Alfred Jensen and Kenward Elmslie. If you weren't in on this at the
beginning, now's the time.

Wishing each of you generously and well!
Enjoy!

By the way, if you are in the San Francisco Bay Area, I recommend - as a
wonderful gift to yourself - a visit to the Yerba Buena Art Center (across
from the Museum of Modern Art - which can also keep you going with big
exhibits of Kike Smith and Chuck Close). The two installations at Yerba
Buena - one by the English sculptor, Cornelia Parker, and the other by the
Chinese artist, Wang Du, are quite - in my opinion - on the edge, spell
binding and provocative on several levels: political, aesthetic and
otherwise (that is, I been thinking about both of them for a long-time after
being with the work. Yes, good idea to take the time).

If you are either close or at a distance, I continue to suggest a visit to
Chris Sullivan's blogsite
http://8letters.blogspot.com/
- where Chris remains in the 'post-Katrina' world, giving close account to
his life and responses amongst the local detritus. His sound piece,  "Post
Katrina This'n'That: Used Fridge For Sale" - where he does a take off on a
salesman - curbside - selling reclaimed fridges is, well, hilarious. Chris
has obviously found a deeply intriguing, "nether world", - journeying about
New Orleans. Makes one realize that "alive" or "dead" New Orleans maintain
its mystique, its unique situation as a theater and cultural hub, only now
with a radically altered stage-set.
I suspect more artists and writers, like Chris, are working the territory.
One can only suspect war as Walmarters and mall-makers invade to claim the
region with their 'virtual reality' reconstruction templates.
Chris definitely puts the "reality" back into "virtual."

Charles: are you going to add the reading from the 1963 Vancouver
poetry bash?
I don't know who has the master. Maybe Wah?
I have it (and Olson's) on a cassette for my car, eh?

They hang the man and flog the woman

That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or hypocritica

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Here is a good talk by Katherine Hayles from 9/16/00: Romantic Bits:
Embedded in Media: http://english.asu.edu/ramgen/english/hayles.rm

Among other things, she talks about the differences between reading/viewing
William Blake in print and reading/viewing the Blake archive on the Web.
More generally, she talks about the differences between print and screen and
the process of moving between them. I'm not sure why, but these differences
seem hard for many writers to recognize. I suppose it has to do with the
power that print has on perception among those who are profoundly immersed
in it. As McLuhan said, 'environments are invisible' when they are deeply
familiar.

This lecture will be old stuff for many (of course it is somewhat old:
9/16/00), but even for those who recognize what she's talking about, there
must surely be some admiration for her cogent, persuasive presentation.

By the way, if you do a yahoo video search for Katherine Hayles, you
encounter several other videos, if you're interested. Here's another talk by
her: http://www2.humlab.umu.se/events/humlabseminariet_ht2005_hayles.htm .
This one concerns her recent book My Mother Was a Computer : Digital
Subjects and Literary Texts.

The season coming to end, one's left to reflect on,
ponder, the whatnot of past year. "There are places
wherein only loss might exist," I said. Within big
hands, I'd sat for a long time, and now this poem
given him years ago seems, perhaps, worth sharing. So
far away from home, I hope so. My best to all, to
poems and poets, to kindness and compassion, to anger
that might lead us somewhere better and more focused.

   Void can be touched, tasted, plump

   I wrap round nests around loud sentences--

  Jonathan,

  Thanks.  I find a lot here of interest and while I went off on the  iPod--and downloading music--in my culture=good, technology=bad rant, I  would demur from blaming it either for the possible starvation of Bob  Dylan, or the general idiotization of culture.  The iPod and  downloading music are good thing, for they leverage what digital  technology has been productive for, in cultural work:  they extend  the reach of the archive and the library.  That is exactly what  the student is doing in downloading films.

  I think I understand "technology" differently than you do.  To me,  technology is Western culture's enthrallment with gadgets (and the  expenditure of resources of bodies, time and money to them).  You  seem to be talking about "tekne" in the larger Greek sense, which is  the ways of doing what gets done.  In that sense, culture--ours or  others'  whole way of life, for which the best indicators (but  only indicators)  are the arts, sexual mores, and food--is  inseparable from technology.  But gadgetry is babbitry, not much  different than the usual hucksterism of amerikan culture.  And the  frigging personal computer industry, like or not, is the source of much  of that hucksterism, which usually masks itself in the guise of  innovation and entrepreneurship.

  I think a generous skepticism--if such a stance is possible without  contradiction--is what one should bring to the claims of things being  new, but the adage that works the best for me remains, Old wine, new  bottles.  Even film harnesses, for the most part, the theatrical  tradition that has been with us since the time of Shakespeare.  It  also harnesses the traditions of representational and  non-representational art.  Film is a lot more like opera, in its  mingling of various movements, than it is something _absolutely_ new  under the sun.  Nevertheless, film and broadcast media do  represent tremendous shifts in the reach and understanding of culture  (similar, though shallower, in effect to the popularization of  printing).  Digital culture, so far, does not effect such a  change.  When it does perhaps there will be something new under  the sun.

  That said, I have a blog and I am beginning to work with wiki.  I am not immune from curiosity about these things.

  Robert






Jonathan Penton <unlikely@NATISP.COM> wrote:  Hi Robert,

I was going to respond to your analysis of iPods with a very foolish
comment about "the difference between tools and toys," but I was saved
by visiting a filmmakers' board today, where a student was talking about
his new way of learning films: since he has given up on finding useful
data from Hollywood, he instead goes to school, plugs in his iPod,
downloads hundreds of megs in independent free film, and watches and
studies them at home, on that tiny screen, at his convenience. I do
something similar at cafes with wireless, as a fan, but I'm not trying
to run Premiere. He needs a desktop.

Myself, I need a CD writer and PC; I use them as tools. Free with these
tools comes the ability to record, for myself, an unlimited amount of
music. In many places, the ability to learn about new music from the
radio or clubs is negligible, and I simply can't afford to pay industry
prices for music on a regular basis. (And, yes, if Bob Dylan ever falls
into abject poverty as a result of my actions, rest assured I'll try to
help.)

That's not in argument with your points, of course. Neither the CD
writer's value to me nor the iPod's value to that film student
constitute a revolution. (The only statement you made that I would
object to is your dissatisfaction with CD-Rs, as I am not aware of any
sound recording technology, available to the public, that was
particularly resliant to wear.) Of course technology is a mess.
Technology will always be a mess, and there are always those who, as a
result of fetishizing technology, will enjoy that mess; namely, they
will enjoy their ability to acquire useless items that no one else yet
has. And, because of this very large and strong market, we put up with
many substandard products; it's likely the film student I mentioned
would vastly prefer an iPod that would last as long as your speaker
system (and I'm betting your speaker system is far more physically
attractive). And yes, that is infuriating. On the other hand, a few
decades ago, these fetishistic personalities were buying bigger and less
efficient internal combustion engines as a manner of competing with one
another. I would prefer they screw up our .mp3 technology than our
everything.

I think we might be using different meanings of the word "culture." To
me, a culture and its technology is inextricable, and to refer to the
"wisdom" of a culture is almost tautalogical: could we generate wisdom
from /outside/ of our culture? And if not, are not our wisdom and our
technology rooted together?

Yours,
--

Makes me think of time working as first mate on Lake
Michigan. I was living out'f my car, 5 bucks an hour,
screwing women for a place to sleep and a shower, some
who loved men but who'd fuck women out'f shear
loneliness, there was this 60-something bull who'd
mutter about her computer and first husband, and so
were therefore out'f practice, how we all seem to need
the same damn thing, some who loved women and wanted
to exert agency over something so small, and trying to
complete university, not much of cassanova, and mom'd
decided I'd, once again, let'er down. A real life,
very real, the cord of a poet, as opposed to the cork.

For six years, mark(s) [http://www.markszine.com]  has consistently endeavored to create a dialogue between Detroit-based  writers/artists and the world. At this juncture, mark(s) brings 15,000  virtual visitors to Detroit each issue. We plan to build upon this  success, and continue to take mark(s) to an ever-expanding audience. We  need your help to accomplish these goals.

 Time and success  have created new needs for mark(s) and the next year is important for  its continued success. Hardware costs, the rising costs of additional  server space requirements and heightened bandwidth usage are a month to  month concern. Plans for the coming year include a large promotional  campaign and the addition of an adserver to help meet mark(s)'  financial obligations.

 Our goal is to raise $10,000 dollars, which will greatly assist in  the implementation of these essential development plans. We believe our  mission of sustaining a dialogue with global cultural communities is an  important one for Detroit's varied cultural communities. We hope you  share that view and will help meet our goal.

 You're invited to show your support and join us in the Cass Cafe  loft on January 14, 2006, between 7 and 9 p.m., for a "rent party" to  help mark(s) meet immediate needs. There'll be an open bar, music by  Big Shorty and good company!

 Busy on the 14th? Out of town but would still like to offer  support? You can still support mark(s) in its mission of free access to  the arts. Please make an online donation of 1 to 50 dollars(US) using  the postMedia PayPal account at http://www.markszine.com/rentparty.html.

Subject:      Poetry sought for Indiana Airport
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The Indianapolis Airport Authority and the Writers' Center of Indiana
are seeking Indiana poets to submit poems to be considered for inclusion
in artwork at the new Indianapolis Airport.

Poets must be residents or have a significant connection to Indiana,
which must be explained in a 50 to 100 word biography accompanying the
poetry submission.

The winning authors will receive payment for their submission and help
determine the visual form of the text in the final artwork. The artwork
and text will be seen by approximately 8 million passengers annually.

Submissions may be of any length and must not have been previously
published.

Desirable themes may include, but are not limited to, travel (especially
air travel), aviation and aviation history, flying or being aloft,
journeying, transition, visiting and returning home. Also desirable are
writings expressing the character of Indiana, its land, people, culture,
history and experiences.

The winning poetry will be included in artwork created by Martin Donlin,
a native of Great Britain, who has been commissioned to design 5,000
square feet of art glass for curtain walls in the airport's new
passenger terminal, now under construction. (Preliminary designs for the
glass may be viewed at www.newindairport.com/art_at_finalists.shtm and
previous Donlin artwork may be viewed at www.martindonlin.com).

Poetry submissions may be made electronically to
mailto:airportpoetry@indianawriters.org no later than 5 pm Jan 31.

To receive full submission guidelines, including alternative methods of
submission, e-mail mailto:airportpoetry@indianawriters.org or contact
the Writer's Center of Indiana at 317-255-0710.

The new Indianapolis Airport will feature a new terminal building
located between the two existing main runways along with new highway
access, new and improved parking and support facilities and improved
utilities and airside operations. The airport is scheduled to open in
late 2008.

Then you need Klepto-Clean!



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Dear Friend,

I just signed this petition to send a message to the GOP Congress in
Washington demanding hearings in the House of Representatives on President
Bush's domestic spying on American citizens.

With your help, we can turn up the volume of our demand for accountability

Jeff Snyder (b.1978) is a composer, electronics performer, and sound artist
working in New York City. His works, which characteristically employ
combinations of acoustic, electric, and electronic instruments, have been
performed by a variety of ensembles. In addition to his concert works, he
has frequently collaborated with artists from other mediums, including
choreographers, visual artists, and video artists. Jeff received his
undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he
studied with Stephen Dembski and Joel Naumann. As a current doctoral
candidate at Columbia University, Jeff continues his compositional studies
under the direction of Fred Lerdahl and Joseph Dubiel. Recently, he has
joined the Wet Ink composers' collective, presenting concerts of new music
in the New York area. When not composing concert music or designing sound
installations, Jeff can be seen performing as one-half of the Disembodied
Head of Peter Ladefoged and one-third of the experimental electronic trio
Jesus Crisco. In addition to his own electronic works, Jeff enjoys remixing
other artists and has produced remixes for artists ranging from Public Enem=

s
(O Books, 1999). Originally from California, Toscano has been living in NYC
for the last seven years.

Hannah Weiner (1928-1997) was an influential poet and performance artist of
the generation of the New American Poetry. Best known for her Clairvoyant
Journal project, recently published in full by the UCSD Archive for New
Poetry (http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/m504/index.html), Weiner's unique
"clair-style" writing helped make her a crucial bridge between New York
School and L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE poetry, as well as demonstrating the lasting
influence of the 1960s NYC avant-garde upon contemporary American poetics
generally. Interest in her work has only grown in recent years, with
unpublished works such as PAGE and Country Girl appearing in print, as well
as reiterations of the tri-vocal performance methods instigated by the
widely circulated audio recordings of her Clairvoyant Journal texts. Hannah
Weiner's Open House, a selection of mostly unpublished works from the Weine=
r
Archive, is forthcoming from Kenning Editions. The book serves to
demonstrate the wider range of Weiner's achievement over decades of creativ=
e
engagement with several forms of poetry and performance.

Jeremy Woodruff (1973, Brooklyn, NY) grew up and was educated in Boston
before he traveled to London to study with Michael Finnissy at the Royal
Academy of Music. He then undertook a study of South Indian music and
completed a diploma in Non-Western music at the Conservatorium von
Amsterdam. He now lives in Berlin with his wife and son. His most recent
commissions were by the Kammerensemble Neue Musik Berlin and by Ensemberlin=
o
Vocale and Martin Krouse, percussionist.

Dear Poetics friends,

I have been with you for five years. In that time, I have published two
small chapbooks, "Bangs," which is sold out, and recently "Plausible
Worlds," which is definitely not. It is the latter of these two about which
I am writing you today. I am writing to implore you to buy a copy for
yourself.

"Plausible Worlds" is a very funny book, but also one that can be taken
seriously at a number of levels. It is not 'post-ironic' or what have you;
it is meant as an assessment of authentic life in a consumerist,
pop-beholden culture. Physically speaking, it is a beautiful book, with a
pleasing heft, enjoyable to hold. Finally, it is a book that can be read at
a sitting or taken in smaller doses over a longer period of time: your
choice.

More details about "Plausible Worlds," including ordering information and a
link to Silliman's review of it, are to be found at http://observable.org.
The cost of it is only $8, including shipping, and can be paid via Paypal to
orders@observable.org. And get this--Observable Books is offering a MONEY
BACK GUARANTEE.  If you don't like it, send it back for a full refund!

That's all from me for now.

Happy new year,

Aaron Belz

Thanks, Matt!  I am aware that there are at least two other Aarons who would
have fit the line-up, too.  Now I wish I would have invited them.

Someday I would like to host a reading in which all the poets have the exact
same name.

There are actually two other Aaron Belzes in America, but neither of them
are poets. There is also a famous rabbi named Aaron of Belz, but he, I
think, is no longer with us.

It would also be interesting to see two poets reading together who have each
other's name in reverse, such as Nicholas Christopher and Christopher
Nicholas.

The Continuum of Sound

The continuum of sound can't be
out of place. Form foams old man
foamer, the beauty of airports,
what do poets know of capital anyway?
Tarry by the slack pile until it has
the quality of truth, a place with
no single word rises around us. It's
a novel about cities in wartime.
Freedom imitates tyranny, thief liquor
rugby spleen. All my inventing is
a complete disaster. More room for
necks and another chest. Now here
is the cut-out lake. Writing about
others as if they were nature. Each
word is cheapened in the air. Dewey
eyed playback to where the I goes.
Roughnecks have received insufficient
attention. The world is full and doesn't
ask for more. I waddled and took myself
out walking. A bulbous token of sex and
crafstmanship. She knew something of
the ethics of memory. Bad vibe job market
in good vibe media surround. Me on my
head, that is my body. Trajectory
itself another seminal structure.
