I confess I don't get Maria's objections. Was anyone
contesting the value of multiple readings, playful
readings, counter-readings? The distinction I was trying to
draw had more to do with the intent than the findings -- in
the act of interpretation, does one think of the text as a
readerly Rubik's Cube or a writerly game of Go?

Here's to surreptitious names, trees, and teeth! May they
proliferate.

What a lovely man Fielding Dawson was. And generous. When I started a
magazine in the mid sixties I wrote and asked him for something and
he sent me something so mysterious and good that I was astounded and
very grateful. When he came and lived here in Vancouver for a while a
couple decades ago, I was hoping he would stay, but then there was
new York, that place.

MAT JOHNSON, CHRISTINA CHIU, MIKE ALBO, MICHELE MADIGAN SOMERVILLE

MAT JOHNSON's novel, Drop, just out from Bloomsbury, receives high praise
from The Washington Post Book World: "Johnson's talent is obvious from the
get-go ... [Drop is] comical, serious, and eloquent-all at the same time."

MICHELE MADIGAN SOMERVILLE is the author of Wisegal (Ten Pell Books). Her

year 2000 first place winner of the WB Yeats Society's poetry competition.

MIKE ALBO: "The brilliance of Albo's cynical nostalgia may be lost on those
who neither came of age in the New Wave '80s nor participated in the urban
retro trends of the '90s, this writer's formidable gift for humor and
self-flagellating satire transcends the limits of a generation-X audience."

It's been years since I read Bob Shaeffer's doctoral dissertation on the
topic -- it may be a book by now. But the ineluctable logic of the past
century has been one of increasingly narrow claims proving "sufficient" for
the self-determination of nationhood. Self-determination being the exact
opposite of community & responsibillity. I guess I'm one of the old
one-worlders J. Edgar Hoover warned you about.

Philip K Dick has a great vision of the war between Bolinas & Stinson Beach
in his book Dr Bloodmoney, I'd heartily recommend.

The project seems founded on exploring the individual subjectivity of a poet expressed in his or her idiosyncratic language noise  -- an approach that focuses and reinforces notions of a unified self behind the words?  it seems Dworkin doesn't intend this (he gave the talk here at UGA and was asked about psychoanalytic readings.  He said he just wished they'd 'go farther'), but i don't get it.  youuns up thar in the north, could you help me out with this?  (I'll check out the iconicity site) It wouldn't change this or some other questions about the project, but how much more fun if the findings were odder, even more inane.  Like 'universal truth' of some body process (defectation, for eg) across several poets' work.  Or insidious, like finding traces of advertising/pop culture at the noise level in someone's work.  By the way, what did Dworkin say in answer to the questions from the audience?

A Talk by Kirsten Forkert

"Let's perform an action in an obscure part of town. Let's go somewhere
where people will barely leave their houses, barely look through the
windows, only occasionally get into their cars and drive away. A good time
to do this would be high noon or in the middle of the night. This action can
be small or large, something that will mark us as out of place or that will
exist within the confines of 'normal'. We may make no impact, leave no
trace. We may never even be part of a conversation, barely make a difference
in someone's thoughts. This is the reverse of the idea that the more central
the location the better. Let's resist the dynamic of  centralization that
creates oases of 'urban living' for the privileged and makes the rest of the
city a nowhere zone, and let's resist the fear of being left out. Let's work
in the nowhere zones. Let's be at the wrong place at the wrong time."

Kirsten Forkert is a Vancouver-based artist working in installation,
performance and text. Her work, which is often site-specific, focuses on
questions of commonalty, especially alternate ways of conceiving of this.
Projects include "Entre nous deux...", an installation/performance for a
Montreal movie theatre, and an installation in a Vancouver storefront
dealing with gentrification and our relationship to this (especially for
artists). More recent projects have been performances: writing a word on a
storefront window for 2 hours (ECOUTE) walking with a group of people along
Queen St. West in Toronto, wearing dripping backpacks (TOGETHER WE) walking
and stopping for long periods of time in a business district at night
(WALKING AND STOPPING, in collaboration with Peter Conlin).

Beware: it has a lot of visual poetry by contemporary Americans--and even
mathematical
poetry (by Me).  It has much else, though, including quite a bit of Michael
McClure--and a nice selection of essays, notably those of Karl Young, the
sitemaster.

Richard Tyler backchanneled me that he'd visited my mathemaku at
the light & dust site, and found them interesting.  He suggested I tell him
"or the list people something about (my) procedure or raison d'etre?"
I happened to have a paragraph from a bio of myself I recently did for
a vizpo show some friends are trying to organize in NY, so sent it to
Richard,
and repost it here for anyone interested:

Perhaps my most important achievement as a poet has been in mathematical
poetry.  In my mathemaku, as I call my mathematical poems, I try to treat
images and symbols--verbal but also graphic, musical, scientific . . . even
numerical--as mathematical values.  The operations I carry out
on them are intended to imitate proper mathematics--for example, in one poem
I've tried
seriously to divide "the sky" by the actual color blue, and in another to
divide the latter by
its dictionary definition; in the first I found that "explainability" to the
power of "May" is
what blue needs to be multiplied by to get a product close to "the sky"; in
the other that a
variety of highly sensual images have to multiply the definition of blue to
get a series of
sums that approximate the value of the color blue.  My hope is that these
and my other
mathemaku make a sort of sense mathematically, however surrealistically, at
times--but
also work as visual art in my most visual specimens, and as mixtures of
resonant verbal
images even in my most visual specimens.  Lyrical metaphors of archetypal
significance
are my Ultimate Goal.

   For a detailed analysis I did of one of my mathemaku, go to

ISLAM AND ITS DISCONTENTS

Interview of Tunisian writer Abdelwabab Meddeb by Frank Berberich,
translated by Pierre Joris

"The one who claimed superiority or at least equality cannot grasp
the process that has led him to such weakness when faced with the
century-old opposite, enemy or adversary. ... Nietzsche himself
thought that the Islamic subject was a subject that belonged much
more to aristocratic morality, the morality of affirmation, which
glorifies the one who gives without trying to receive; while the
nature of resentment is to be in the position of the one who receives
but who does not have the means to give, the one who is not
affirmative. Thus the Islamic subject is no longer the man of the
"yes" that illuminates the world and creates a naturally hegemonic
being; from sovereign being he has become the man of the "no", the
one who refuses, who is no longer active but only re-active."


NO ONE BELIEVES PLAYS:  AN INTERVIEW WITH SLAWOMIR MROZEK, by Arni Ibsen

"I don't see myself in a context at all because I don't construct my
ego or my self-image. Absolutely not. I know that sounds untrue
because writers usually construct themselves very much in a literary
way, but that's part of the writer's energy. I don't do that. It's an
uninteresting part of the writer's life."


BONE: A MONOLOGUE FOR TWO, by David Bircumshaw

"I have often thought, Bone, of how you would survive without my
assistance. For I am a kindly man, Bone. I recall well how I rescued
you that day, when I used to walk, the last time I walked, when you
were blindly standing by the kerb, pitifully incapable of crossing.
We cannot all cross that road, Bone.  I, of course, have no need to
now. But you, Bone? No, not you."


KNOWLEDGE AND MELANCHOLY: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL FICTION, by Margaret Cameron

"How do you think I have lived? You will not grant me autonomy.
Inert with depression, you insult me. I try to save this house. Oh
the persistent unhappy demands of my life! Anyone would consider
escape. Your instability compromises me. I am afraid of you. In your
house, my 'landlord', I am subject to you. I call witness: be my
guard! I am speaking of 'safe houses'. I cannot let this go
unattended. Your support is getting thin. I ration food. Your visits
brief as Christmas leave me poor. I savour luxuries you leave
everything breaking. You make me cry poor. "


ARE WE SPEAKING (OF) "THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF MEN"? ANNE CARSON,
KATHLEEN FRASER, GRACE LAKE: INNOVATING LYRIC POETRY, by Sophie Levy

"In a sense, claiming the first person pronoun, as lyric does, is
always a mistake, as the poem works to throw off its disembodied 'I'.
This is especially striking in the work of experimental women writers
like Fraser, who knows that it is as hard to get 'I' into the
sentence as 'she,' when the 'I,' like Echo, is a She. Natural
language - the image in the water - is always shifting, depending on
the perspective from which it is seen. Sometimes the lyric 'I' has to
be disembodied in order to access ways of speaking of who we think we
are."


THE CASE FOR CONTROL, by Richard Toop

"Perhaps the most spectacular contribution to 'The Death of
Klinghoffer' debate came from an academic, Prof. Richard Taruskin, of
the University of California at Berkeley. Taruskin is, by general
consent, one of America's leading musicologists, and probably the
greatest living authority on Russian music. He is also known as a
robust controversialist. On December 9 2001, the New York Times
published a near 3000-word essay of his, entitled 'Music's Dangers
and the Case for Control'; in terms of setting the tone of future
arts discourse in America, it may prove to be as significant as
anything else he has written."


PLAGUES AND BIOETHICS, by John Kinsella

"Quarantine isn't just about keeping diseases out, protecting a
specific geography from physical contamination, but also about the
preservation of "home" values. It is about a mental and spiritual
"purity"."


ART AND GENDER: NOTES TOWARDS A POETIC, by Jacinta le Plastrier

"...the issue of gender - the nature of sexual and gender
separateness - is both too coarse and too polite for poetry - and, by
extension, in the context of this discussion, art.

"Too coarse, because poetry sings into being, which lives in the
mouth of life, in the mouth of death; a large mouth, too large for
such coarseness. Too polite, because poetry sings into being... a
mouth so large it simply annihilates such convention and restraint."

Disaster is,

I had only a moment before talking to a corpse but I got it in.

"My call was important to them," I said.

I thnk that there are are several components , although all of these
components musts have interconnections, to Craig Dworkin's disssertation..
Firstly, (and i may "deal" with the "names" and other aspects later)
according to Jeffery Jullich he discusssed the implication, through
"Disceete Series" by Oppen, that the very fact of a methodolgy, or a
processs.."that the very fact of a poem's acceptability as a~mechanism~that
is the proof of meaning..."  However the lecture was titled: "Against
Meaning". Now accepting or allowing that "against" might imply or impute not
that Dworkin is opposed to meaning utterly (which he surely cant be) but
that he is arguing for a new way as he see it of seeing workr which, while
not meaningless, resist the old and some recent types of critical or
readerly response (not just in this case the prioritising or foregrounding
the "signifier" and so on or reaching Steven's ideal of  being near
impervious to analysis (or even to a "conventional" poetic-emotional or even
"visceral" reaction)). So in this sense as I look  (for the first time
closely - for me) at Oppen's work as it is in "Crossing the Millenium"
(editors Pierre Joris and Rothenberg) each poem of that series is possibly a
self-sufficient cell of language and ideational interaction and generation
generated by the procedure it seems of  taking words from the dictionary to
enhance and enrich each "cell" (or point in his dicrete seies)...and to
somewhat separatingly each unit from each other a horizontal line is drawn
above and below each one. Here is one:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    Semaphoring chorus,
    The width of the stage. The usher from it:
    Seats' curving rows two sides by distant
             phosphor. And those "filled";
   Man and wife, removing gloves
   Or overcoat. Still faces already lunar.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

   Now this is preceded by

   A house
   .........
   And flaunts
   A family laundry,
   And the glass of windows
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   The poem is predicated apparently upon a sea trip and things are
"described"  on shipboard and also things such as "A family laundry" are
"noticed" as the traveller-voyeur passes these things seen from the ship.
Distance (and surely aso desire and loneliness) is a thematic thing: as
later:

       From this distance thinking toward you
       Time is recession

 So that thus a subjective thought is also "sent" to the distance (shore,
the "family" earlier reminds the "marrator"...........so the poem is
becoming a linked discrete series yet indeed each part or cell can be
empirically generated (although that phrase is not sufficient). Returning to
"Semaphoring chorus" this could refer to the movement of the laundry just
(or much earlier or imagined....?) seen, as indeed the waves. But "semaphor"
is from the Gk sema meaning "sign" and "phorus" meaning or implying "bearer"
.. but now an "usher"  appears on or from the stage  (the width of the stage
"all the world's a stage")
the usher brings light as does phosphor..the the effect of the screen ( or
phospor markers in a "lunar" or lense-like sweep)..one could build from here
an near -circular and complex interrelationship of signals or signs
"semaphoring"  each other ( also - ok mention of "rim" is amusing but there
ar many edges or margins or places where things are known to begin but
precisely where is (as in the "real world" is problematic)).  Semantic
ambivalence, indeterminancy, etc is in here though very much .. and it
doesnt matter if there is "secrecy" .. infact that "mystery", no, there is
an aspect of "Discrete Series" that is near- sureal and sometime near
romatically haunting, puzzling, mysterious..who after all are the couple?
Who, or exactly what is this usher - it originally meant "door" - and also
of course:  "The usher from it.." is ambivalent:  from what  .. the chorus?
Something unmentioned yet or ever or unmentionable? Isnt it also almost
"The(y) usher from it..."?  They? In fact this stanza, if stanza it can be
called, recalls me to something in Rimbaud .. in fact in "Le bateau Ivre"
which I translated laboriously with a dictionary (and virtually no knowledge
of French really) because I thought that a more 'violent' and 'crazy"
rendering was needed (than Robert Lowell's that I had), but also to T S
Eliot's :  "Issues form the hand of god the simple soul..." and Williams:
"They enter this new world naked, knowing nothing  save that they
nter...[ the first of the "Series" could be by its own (quote from Pound
"admission" ) a quote itself...but to return to Williams...his Spring and
All with its prose, and poem progress and the combination of a kind of
hard-edged "objectivism with  the "'dramatic" and neo-romantic trope of
birth as Spring (in which of course there is birth of all kinds) could well
be a (or have been) a model or influence on "Discrete Series"...
  To jump: I thnk that "Series" can be seen as an intensification of the
process of potental "meaning-generation" which occurs because of the
semi-compressionate nature of the compositional method: but as to privacy or
not of meanings they are there in every text. I dont want to talk about the
inculcation of names into poems (the concept is interesting and I agree with
Jeffery Jullich  that  "Definitely the name is a nacissistic imago  .."
(His comment thatAshbery's "Portrait" was about narcissism ( in a previous
discussion) fascinated me: so obvious yet I hadnt thought of it..it leads
into some fascinating potentials...)).. as this issue is difficult enough.
Even the line "And those "filled"  - possibly the key or pivotal line - as
it draws attention to the very indeterminancy and the attempt to
precisionise that "indeterminacy" of language (the paradoxes inside phrases
we use so frequently we forget there"original" meaning or import(which
"attempt" the writer always is aware at some level in theirself or in
nature's language or language nature, is pre-doomed).
  So "Discrete Series" I see as yes, each one has a degree of self-life but
the entire poem has various thematic linkings or even temporal linking (it
seems on one level to be a  sea journey but also a "trip down meemory lane"
and the sea is everywhere "numerous"  - and even if this is a metaphor for
the writing process itself that undercuts the "discreteness"   (although it
is impossible to know how planned or preconceived this was: I mea "Series")
.. the word "discrete" here is a pointer: discrete as a composititional
technique, attitude, and as a clue that the
writer is here being 'secretive' about the relevance or other of his own
experiences or their direct intrusion in the series.
   A poem is or can be " a small or large machine made of words..." or a
"mechanism" but mechanisms and machines lack the "absolute precision" often
subscibed to them: there are no, and will never be, any perfect or completly
self generating or perpetuating machines. But the concept that the _ very
compositional process_ or the mechanism of the making of  the (a) poem
creates a strong level of meaning  (or the acceptability of the poem as
a -mechanism_that is (is?) the proof of meaning....is  or could be seen as
valid to a point. Taken to absurdity we could thus have a very "meaningful"
poem that had blank lines with the instruction  "utilise structure a)" (or
there could be a sonnet mage upof x', y's commas and numbers to show the
rhyme pattern and so on)...to most people such a poem or "mechanism wold be
to all "practical purposes" meaningless...
   But certainly a poem constructed as a kind of chain of discretes with no
"overarching" raison d'etre, lest that indeed be the mechanism which rightly
becomes a toy of joy leading "nowhere" but into further meaning enchantments
and shufflings, becomes its own reason. But however deliberately or else the
writer attempts  to "sacrifice the referent" referents arise or rearise
from the ashes of the signifiers (whose ghosts are referents)...the societal
and political rears their pretty or ugly mugs and we are still left with an
objective-subjective complex. Of course the acceptance of a mechanism is a
proof or "justifications"  for meaning ( artitifice though, or artificial
meaning. is there any other?)..but if eg Lyn Heijinian's 'justification in
"My Life" were  "only" the shape of her poems, the avoidance of direct
reference, poetic near-Steinian innuendoes, repeated and echoing leitmotivs,
the numbers of parts corresponding to her age: we would feel a bit bereft -
she could have written about the game of Bridge rather than her life (which
by writing is about all lives) ( a case could be made for the validity of
that though I supppose) but the big question is Why?   Why do we write in
such and such a  way...sure we need structures and they may be all the
meaning we "need"...but what structure structure's the structure's
structure: this poetics is fascinating, and we need it, but we need the
human, the emotional, the delicacy harsheness or tenderness and sometimes
passion to either energise or be right in there in the poem or construct.
  Our being haunts us: romanticism haunts us as does surealism and so on:
but I dont wish to unduly concitate any retrograde satans to cackle us into
dullness: I see the language project progressing with and not against the
human project.  Richard Taylor.

I'd love to hear backchannel from people for whom Dick Higgins's Something
Else Press--as a whole or in this or that individual title--played  a
significant role in projecting/expanding a sense of what was possible in
writing (and sounding, and performing, and...) from the mid-1960s forward.

Brief "testimonials" (if that overly serious word here applies) received by
Wednesday around noon may well figure into an informal gallery event I'm
organizing later that evening. We'll be hearing and performing texts
stretching from Novalis to B=F6k-with Stein, Cage, and Mac Low as anchoring
points-and I'd like to be able to convey, in addition to the general sense
of Something Else's contribution to the independent press scene of its
time, some more locating anecdotes of what it felt like, for instance, to
have _The Making of Americans_ back in print after so long, or to first
look into _Stanzas for Iris Lezak_, etc.

So, if Something Else made an impact on your life as a reader, and you've
got a moment to jot down some reflections on that fact, I'd love to hear
from you.

Dedicated to the Twin Towers disaster

"Paint From Nature"
a net-art performance
by CATERINA DAVINIO

Giubbe Rosse - Florence - Italy
February 4th 2002   6:00 PM


The net-performance "Paint From Nature", by Caterina Davinio, will take
place February 4th 2002 at the Giubbe Rosse, historical literary café of the
avant-garde, in Florence, Italy, in co-operation with
Massimo Mori, Elisabeth H. Todal, Tiziano Pecchioli, Fiorenzo Smalzi, during
the opening of the visual poetry exhibition "Tribute to Marinetti".



"Paint From Nature" - the nature as media landscape and telematic passage,
communication movement - is inspired to the disaster of the New York towers,
event which has had a great impact on the collective imaginary in the planet
also for the mass-media dimension which accompanied it.

From September 11 until 14 arrived at Karenina.it e-mail address
threehundred messages, from all over the world, from mailing lists (mainly
from Rhizome, but also from others), from artists, cultural associations,
citizens, navigators, speaking about what happened; from the e-mails arrived
at first, fill of dismay for the sudden interruption of communication with
artistic situations and persons who were in New York in those hours, to the
messages which tried to find information, to bring help, to intervention
which tried a political interpretation of what was happening.

In the copy "from nature" the text of 70 e-mails arrived in Karenina.it
e-mail box September 11 and 12 will be mailed to the Giubbe Rosse and
collocated in an installation during the performance. A wider selection of
the 300 arrived e-mails will be in a web page on the site karenina.it
(poetry in fatica function), after the performance, a web page which is a
continuation of the same performance, with photos of the action. The action
is going to be documented in a book.

The choral sound of the rhizomers voices in the "copy from nature", from the
telematic "truth" - which actuates its existence in the continuous passage
from the real to the virtual and back - comes from an every-place, or from a
no-place, from a texture of contacts, which is also a "thing", space where
enter, wander, look for, reality. This space, in the performance "Paint from
nature", is going to be copied down, or, with a metaphor, photographed,
after it was framed in the monitor, together with some questions about what
a net-performance "really" is, what a "copy from nature" and the "nature"
self, for an artist, in the net, in the media universe, is, how Internet
brings in discussion the role of the artist, his identity, and these
concepts (identity, reality, copy, nature, original, presence, performance,
role, space-time) result disintegrated but also reconstructed.

Caterina Davinio's work "Paint From Nature", made of interaction, action,
e-mail art, creation of an object, copy realized with technologic
instruments which are in hands of an artist today (digital, identical with
the represented original, but that finally concretises itself in an unique
not-reproducible experience at the Giubbe Rosse space, this work, made of
communic/action, and generating itself while the communication runs, do not
falls under the categories that the art and the critic put at disposal.

To be continued very soon in Karenina.it web site


KARENINA.IT (poetry in "fàtica" function) A web project by Caterina Davinio
davinio@tin.it on line since 1998  -  By Jakobson, 'fàtico' is the use of
the language which has the finality to maintain open and operative the
communication channel among the interlocutors. On the confine between art
and critic, happening and net performance, Karenina.it is a virtual meeting
place around the theme of the writing and the new technologies, in which
experiences of international artists, curators, theoreticians converge, in a
net that counts thousands of contacts in the world.

            The BELLADONNA*  Reading Series began in August 1999 at the then
newly opened women’s bookstore (New York’s only) Bluestockings.  In its two
year history, BELLADONNA* has featured such writers as Erica Hunt, Fanny
Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña, Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Lynne
Tillman and Nicole Brossard among many other experimental and hybrid women

work that is experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content.  Alongside the readings, BELLADONNA*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event.  Please contact Rachel Levitsky,
levitsk@attglobal.net,  if you would like to receive a catalog or hear more
about our salons.

Each reading begins with a fifteen minute open.
A three dollar donation is suggested.

          The BELLADONNA*  Reading Series began in August 1999 at the then
newly opened women's bookstore (New York's only) Bluestockings.  In its two
year history, BELLADONNA* has featured such writers as Erica Hunt, Fanny
Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña, Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy and
Nicole Brossard among many other experimental and hybrid women writers.
Beyond being a platform for women writers, the curators promote work that is
experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content.  Alongside the readings, BELLADONNA*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event.  Please contact Rachel Levitsky if you would like to
receive a catalog or hear more about our salons.
There will be a short open reading before the featured readers.

Dedicated to the Twin Towers disaster

"Paint From Nature"
a net-art performance
by CATERINA DAVINIO

Giubbe Rosse - Florence - Italy
February 4th 2001   6:00 PM


The net-performance "Paint From Nature", by Caterina Davinio, will take
place February 4th 2001 at the Giubbe Rosse, historical literary café of the
avant-garde, in Florence, Italy, in co-operation with
Massimo Mori, Elisabeth H. Todal, Tiziano Pecchioli, Fiorenzo Smalzi, during
the opening of the visual poetry exhibition "Tribute to Marinetti".



"Paint From Nature" - the nature as media landscape and telematic passage,
communication movement - is inspired to the disaster of the New York towers,
event which has had a great impact on the collective imaginary in the planet
also for the mass-media dimension which accompanied it.

From September 11 until 14 arrived at Karenina.it e-mail address
threehundred messages, from all over the world, from mailing lists (mainly
from Rhizome, but also from others), from artists, cultural associations,
citizens, navigators, speaking about what happened; from the e-mails arrived
at first, fill of dismay for the sudden interruption of communication with
artistic situations and persons who were in New York in those hours, to the
messages which tried to find information, to bring help, to intervention
which tried a political interpretation of what was happening.

In the copy "from nature" the text of 70 e-mails arrived in Karenina.it
e-mail box September 11 and 12 will be mailed to the Giubbe Rosse and
collocated in an installation during the performance. A wider selection of
the 300 arrived e-mails will be in a web page on the site karenina.it
(poetry in fatica function), after the performance, a web page which is a
continuation of the same performance, with photos of the action. The action
is going to be documented in a book.

The choral sound of the rhizomers voices in the "copy from nature", from the
telematic "truth" - which actuates its existence in the continuous passage
from the real to the virtual and back - comes from an every-place, or from a
no-place, from a texture of contacts, which is also a "thing", space where
enter, wander, look for, reality. This space, in the performance "Paint from
nature", is going to be copied down, or, with a metaphor, photographed,
after it was framed in the monitor, together with some questions about what
a net-performance "really" is, what a "copy from nature" and the "nature"
self, for an artist, in the net, in the media universe, is, how Internet
brings in discussion the role of the artist, his identity, and these
concepts (identity, reality, copy, nature, original, presence, performance,
role, space-time) result disintegrated but also reconstructed.

Caterina Davinio's work "Paint From Nature", made of interaction, action,
e-mail art, creation of an object, copy realized with technologic
instruments which are in hands of an artist today (digital, identical with
the represented original, but that finally concretises itself in an unique
not-reproducible experience at the Giubbe Rosse space, this work, made of
communic/action, and generating itself while the communication runs, do not
falls under the categories that the art and the critic put at disposal.

To be continued very soon in Karenina.it web site


KARENINA.IT (poetry in "fàtica" function) A web project by Caterina Davinio
davinio@tin.it on line since 1998  -  By Jakobson, 'fàtico' is the use of
the language which has the finality to maintain open and operative the
communication channel among the interlocutors. On the confine between art
and critic, happening and net performance, Karenina.it is a virtual meeting
place around the theme of the writing and the new technologies, in which
experiences of international artists, curators, theoreticians converge, in a
net that counts thousands of contacts in the world.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

PARTLY WRITING II: Collaborative Imperatives and Translative
Practices

13/14 April, Oxford Brookes University; Organizers: Caroline
Bergvall and Romana Huk

The second in this series of events on writers' negotiations with public
space focuses on forms of responsive work such as collaborations and
translations.  We plan to consider what kind of dialogues collaborative
work creates and what kind of shifting engagement with materials and
contexts collaborations and translations might imply.  Suggesting that
translation is a collaboration of a particular kind, we will be
considering activities of translation as a traffic not only from text to
text but also from site to site, from media to media, from context to
context. Part of the premise is that collaborative work might expose what
has been left out -- what couldn't be fitted in -- but remains as the
untranslatable and the incompatible, always there in the shadow of the
work.  We want to invert, for the purposes of conversation, notions of
'achievement' and 'failure' in such work, and entertain the idea that
the failure of, as much as the push towards, dialogue is at the heart of
collaborative practice.

------------------------------------

PARTLY WRITING I (Dartington College of Arts, 19/20 January 2002) was
dedicated to thinking through what constitutes public space and how
writers negotiate their work as public engagement.  It was
entirely conversation-led.

PARTLY WRITING II pursues related questions within a structure that
allows for short presentations to be made alongside conversation-led
seminars.

Some of the questions that will inform both presentations and
seminars are:

-- What is the space of collaborative writing?
-- Is there a locatable subject or subjects in the collaborative text?
-- What kinds of contextual imperatives prompt collaboration?
-- Have collaborations between writers or across art forms been changing
   in process or product?
-- Has translation changed focus?
-- Is an understanding of translation particularly relevant now?
-- Where do we locate or site the translated/translingual writing?


If you wish to attend the event, please send 30 pounds by cheque (made
payable to Oxford Brookes University: Centre for Modern and Contemporary
Poetry) to Romana Huk, School for the Humanities, Oxford Brookes
University, Gipsy Lane Campus, Headington, Oxford OX3 OBP.  There will be
no one taking registration information on the day; we will simply have
information ready in packets designated for pre-paid participants. (Rates
for one day's participation, and for students/seniors, is 15 pounds.)  We
will reserve spaces on a first-come-first-serve basis.  There are also
several spaces open for scholars and practitioners to offer short papers,
or to take part in the seminar discussions; please send proposals or
queries to either Caroline or myself by the end of February if this
interests you (c.bergvall@btinternet.com; rch@cisunix.unh.edu). Please
also visit our website for running details about Partly Writing 1, to see
where we've been; information and details about Partly Writing 2 will
appear there in due course as well:

   www.dartington.ac.uk/partlywriting/

If you wish to make payment in another currency, contact Romana.
Please do not use Romana's Brookes address for correspondence; it is
accessed only once per week.  Do contact Simon Baalham for lists of local
B&Bs and for directions to campus: s.baalham@brookes.ac.uk

As part of my thesis project for the New School's mfa program, I'm
assembling a small anthology of centos ("patchwork poems" in which every
line is taken from another poem).

Please help me by sending your own centos (note source texts, please) or the
titles of all the centos you've loved before.

You'll receive nothing but my thanks, a mild service-to-your-fellow-poet
high, and, if you want, a copy of the final paper.

Please email sholman@mac.com directly with your questions and/or
submissions.

Thanks,

Shannon

SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC PRESENTS

Friday, February 15, 2002 at 7:30 p.m.
Andrew Maxwell & Liz Waldner

Tonight we present two truly extraordinary & splashy poets, each witty &
compelling in equal measure. Poet, editor, & translator Andrew Maxwell’s
Radiant Species is forthcoming from Tougher Disguises in 2002. He edits
The Germ, a Journal of Poetic Research & is among the editorial collective
of Double Change, an online journal dedicated to interaction between
American & French language poets. He lives in Los Angeles, where he works
as a lexicographer. Liz Waldner’s books include Homing Devices (O Books,
1998) -- of which Eileen Myles exclaimed “this is my dream of literature”
--, A Point Is That Which Has No Part (University of Iowa Press, 2000),

      Registration now open

We are pleased to announce that registration is now available for
Incubation, the Second Conference on Writing and the Internet, to be
held at
The Nottingham Trent University, UK  on 15th-17th July 2002.

Main speakers include:

Lizzie Jackson, Editor, Communities, BBCi
Talan Memmott, winner of the trAce/Alt-X New Media Writing Award for his

work "Lexia to Perplexia" and
Robin Rimbaud, sound artist, on working with digital texts and sounds.

Incubation2 is the second trAce International Conference on Writing &
the
Internet, and the premier international event for writers working on the

web. In 2000 it attracted delegates from around the world, including
America, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Holland, Norway, Slovenia and
Sweden.
2002 promises to be even bigger. Incubation2 is not just a chance to
hear
some of the best writers working on the web today. It will provide a
showcase for the writing of the future and offer a glimpse into the work
of
writers who use the internet to develop ground-breaking content: poetry
with
sound and images, personal histories, news, journalism, stories with
multiple endings. This is writing on the web, for the web, and about the

web.

The conference is a significant opportunity for writers to extend their
professional development, learn new skills, and interact with some of
the
leading writers and artists working online today. There will be
opportunities to meet with writers who have made a significant
contribution
to this new form, as well as the chance for writers to show their own
work
and look at other people's. There will be skills-based workshops and
feedback workshops, panel discussions, presentations, demonstrations and

performances, and plenty of opportunity to network and meet those people
you
only ever knew online.

An archive of pictures, sound recordings and comments about the previous

Incubation conference in 2000 is also available.

We hope we will be meeting you in July.

If this is a democracy (and there is doubt about this), then it is the
people who are responsible.
So where are the celebrated voices that spoke out during the Vietnam War?
Where are the intellectuals? What's the Poet Laureate saying about the
killing fields called Afghanistan? Where are the Yippies?

the true complaint

see our breasts. We want to touch everything. We want to mark mark, almost
sexualized, as our bruised breasts would smash our bodies locked together.
i will never rest or sleep again until i know THE TERRIBLE - THE TERRIBLE
SECRET. this place has a terrible secret. it's an institution; the charred
palm and wood matches igniting everything in the institution. I'd rather
you fuck me until we drop, rather than reveal a single word of this not to
ever have the slightest inkling of this, ever. Even if we fuck and our
species imitates the dead. we are wanderers without hope of the All, but
the prognosis - pro gnosis - was different. it was a dead end. i noticed
there are an enormous number of potential diseases, some deadly. i want to
be of the living with the dead. we left stones unturned, noted how we came
to call each other black and blue. our skins around our fuck until we drop
are reddened and almost dead as we write our quality text. Aw, who am I
kidding? No one will skin us, alive or dead; we'll molder dead; our tales
of terrible sex will die with us. THE TERRIBLE SECRET will die with us.
We'd like to burn the institution to the ground. I'm keeping THE TERRIBLE
SECRET. You know nothing's going to happen.

E Nessuno

Pressed against the glass my mouth bleeds a little and I ask why do we use
metal to fill our rotten teeth? The pressure opens the stitches in my fat
lip. The sound of speaking another language angers me ; I do not sound like
Dante or Pablo Neruda.  The tierra austral is in  the sleep around my eyes
and smell of the morning dankness.  Fastness and fasting do not come
together.  As I lack food I lack time to listen to the sound of the toilet
flushing or the gas leaking out of the broken pipes.  Tear open the package
and pour the contents into a bowl, mix vigorously and ask --why not eat the
box as well?

Individual colors are filling places where once I had monochrome feelings.
The photographs are filled with images of people with small chin clefts like
my wife's and long flaxen hair.  The monochrome allowed for various grays,
now I do not know
What gray looks like. But chin clefts are a sign of the consumption of much
coffee during pregnancy.

The color of the dirt was tasty and I asked for more tartar sauce. How did a
group as violent as the Tartars invent such a sauce? Brian had a son today I
wish I had a son.  Memories flow and ask questions of my debilities.

Does anyone out there know of any recent essays etc. that take an
interesting look at/approach to apostrophe (not apostrophe in the sense of
a mark ' used to indicate the omission of letters or figures etc, but
apostrophe in the sense of Shelley's "O Wild West Wind" or Kenneth Koch's
recent "New Addresses")?  If so, I'd greatly appreciate a backchannel at
dkane@panix.com.

thanks in advance,

In Surprise Move, House Speaker Schedules Vote Next Week on Campaign Financ=
e
Overhaul

By ADAM CLYMER and ALISON MITCHELL
In Depth
Congress

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 =8B Speaker J. Dennis Hastert announced today that the
House would vote next week on a long-stalled bill that would amount to the
broadest campaign finance legislation since the Watergate era.

The legislation to ban the use of soft money, the unlimited contributions
from businesses, unions and wealthy individuals that reached $500 million i=
n
2000, will be debated on Tuesday and come to a vote on Wednesday, he said.

"I expect there will be a vigorous debate on this issue that will reflect
well on the House of Representatives," Mr. Hastert said.

While Republican leaders oppose the bill, a vote on it was made inevitable
when supporters obtained 218 signatures, or a majority of the House, on a
petition that forced the measure to the floor.

Still, proponents of the bill were caught slightly off-guard by the timing
of Mr. Hastert's announcement and said they had expected it to come up in
the last week of February, which would have given more time for grass-roots
lobbying.

A spokesman for Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the
Democratic leader, said, "We thought we had an agreement to do it later in
the month, but we're eager to do it sooner."

Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Massachusetts Democrat who is one of
the bill's chief sponsors, said: "It's coming up quicker than anyone
anticipated. I like our chances. The unfolding Enron scandal underscores th=
e
need for campaign finance reform."

The impending debate now sets off a final scramble for votes with neither
side certain who will win.

Senior Republican aides said one of the reasons that the House leaders had
decided to move now is that they wanted to head off any effort by the bill'=
s
supporters to delay its effect until after the 2002 elections. They said
they feared that such a delay might build more Republican support for the
measure. The Republican aides said that if the debate happened now and the
bill could become effective quickly, some Democrats might worry about votin=
g
for it. Democrats have run about even with Republicans in soft money
fund-raising, but they lag behind Republicans in regulated donations.

Some supporters of the measure, declining to be named, suggested that
another reason for the speedy vote was the expectation that two of the
bill's major supporters, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Mr=
.
Gephardt, of Missouri, would be unavailable to lobby for health reasons.

Mr. McCain is at the Mayo Clinic for plastic surgery after removal of an
early form of melanoma from his nose. Mr. Gephardt had hernia surgery
scheduled for next week. After Mr. Hastert told him the bill would come up,
Mr. Gephardt rescheduled the procedure for this Friday.

John P. Feehery, the spokesman for Mr. Hastert, said, however, that Mr.
Hastert had scheduled the vote in consultation with Mr. Gephardt and had
originally wanted to have it on Monday and Tuesday, but waited a day to
accommodate Mr. Gephardt. He said Mr. McCain had not been a factor in the
decision.

Fred Wertheimer, head of Democracy 21 and one of the architects of the 1974
Federal Election Campaign Act as well as a longtime critic of the use of
soft money, said that while intensive lobbying had been planned for the
Congressional recess this month, "the grass-roots lobbying will continue an=
d
intensify up until the votes on Wednesday."

Similar legislation has passed twice before in the House, but always in the
correct expectation that a Senate filibuster would kill it. But after the
Senate passed the bill last year, the House action took on a crucial nature=
,
especially because President Bush has made it clear that while he does not
like the bill, he cannot be counted on to veto it.

After the Senate vote, the bill nearly came to the House floor in July, but
when supporters decided the procedures were stacked against passage, they
killed it on a procedural vote. Republican leaders declined to reschedule
it, so supporters filed the petition to force action, and on the second day
of this session in January they reached the 218 signatures required to brin=
g
it up.=20

The bill is supported by nearly all House Democrats, and a couple of dozen
Republicans. If all members who have voted for it before do so again, it
will pass, but with the likelihood of it becoming law, the pressure on some
moderates will be intense, both from the Republican leaders, who unanimousl=
y
oppose the bill, and from groups like Common Cause, whichback it. "We asked
for a fair vote and we are going to get one," said Scott Harshbarger,
president of Common Cause.

Under the procedures set by the petition and confirmed by Mr. Hastert, the
bill will be pit against as many as two competitors and face numerous
amendments. Supporters want as few changes as possible to speed Senate
action and avert a House-Senate conference.

I'm interested in, I think, how this opens up to other systems and methods.

There seem to be two distinct types of truth and/or systems of
argumentation at work: the larger discursive truth of the "reading" and its
parts, but also the iconic evidence that's perceived to be semiotically and
logically separate.  These types don't seem to be displayed with equal
proportion or value, but the proportions and values of each system are
necessarily linked to the logic of the other system.  One might try to
contend that they're not semiotically or logically separate, but I think
that would be a tough go.  That would mean saying something like "sadness"
is in the stanza in the same way as the "tree" is.  That would be curious,
but this doesn't seem to be what's happening.

What's interesting to me is not so much the reading or a series of
readings, but the emergence of the other system and its logic and values,
its "visibility," now "legibility" and how reading negotiates all that,
subsumes it, etc.

Thanks very much to Florian Cramer for his translation of Roberto Simanowski's article on
several pieces of mine at
http://www.dichtung-digital.com/2001/12/10-Simanowski/cramer.htm . The original German version
of the article is at http://www.dichtung-digital.com/2001/12/10-Simanowski/index.htm

It is named "Kampf/Tanz der Wörter -- Jim Andrews' kinetisch-konkrete audio-visuelle Poesie"
("Fighting/Dancing Words -- Jim Andrews' Kinetic, Concrete Audiovisual Poetry") and looks at
Seattle Drift, Enigma n, Arteroids 1.0 at theremediproject.com, Nio, and the stir fry texts.

There is also an interview of me by Roberto at
http://www.dichtung-digital.com/2001/12/29-Andrews/index.htm .

These are pieces that will be in Roberto Simanowski's upcoming http://www.dichtung-digital.de
from Germany which is devoted to digital writing and aesthetics. And apparently very strange
poetry.

magazines.

FIRST WOMAN, with art by Margot McGowan, is the 12th addition to the 2River
Chapbook Series.

POG is in the midst of a pledge drive, trying to raise $1,000 this spring in
individual donations (we raised several hundred dollars in fall).  So far,
in the past 10 days, $400 has been donated or pledged.  So we have $600
still to raise in individual donations.

Please consider pledging to POG.  A $100 donation makes you a Patron; $50
makes you a Sponsor.  But no amount is too small!

If you'd like more information about POG, please email us or visit us on the
web.

thanks for your help,

A question.  I'm trying to track down the original text of Colin MacCabe's
review of Tom Raworth's _Writing_.  The review appeared in the _TLS_;
however, the editors required MacCabe to make extensive changes to
it--notably, forcing him to weaken his praise of the book & to include a
passage comparing it to the work of Tony Harrison.  MacCabe himself can't
seem to find the original text now (I asked him) & I'd like to get a copy; I
know it has been circulated at least to some extent as I've seen it cited
twice in its original version in articles on Raworth.  Could someone help me
out? -- all best --N

In New York, at the major  independent bookstores, you see signs about (and
signs of) groups forming, meetings happening to organize against the war,
many led by well-known poets & writers (well, well-known to me; I don't
think people like Anne Waldman or whomever else are well-known outside the
readings/poetry scene, but within it they are very known, whether you like
their work or not...)

I keep meaning to go to a meeting, but I am busy and also dead tired having
just emerged from a long down time, so I have to choose my battles, and (you
may fault me for this) what I find I really want to do is to catch up with
my own reading and writing after 13 months of nothingness.

I do go to readings a lot though, so why not to an anti-war meeting?  I was
even brought up as a Quaker, by two parents who were very active against the
Vietnam War (my father refused to go to his call-up and had a whole
demonstration, just for him, that went to Whitehall Street.  Now he has
become so conservative that he supports this war, although he would never
vote for Bush for social welfare reasons and because of always voting for
democrats...  But he really believes we have to stamp out terrorists.  I am
begining to fear that anyone the govenment doesn't like will be labeled a
terrorist.

The relevance of this story is a long stretch (since it was police and not
the feds & also pre sept. 11), but I once was stopped by the NYC police and
threatened with a night in jail because I put up a poster for an online
writing class I was teaching (I had been doing it free for mentally ill
folks for a couple of years and people finally said that with the time I was
putting in I should try to make money on it, so I put up a few posters,
saying the class was $100 (for 8 weeks--it was a bargain!) or free for
disabled, unemployed, or persons on public assistance) and two cops in a
super duper copmobile stopped me and said I was breaking the law and didn't
I know it.  I didn't.  I was defacing a bus-stop that didn't belong to me.
(There were at least 40 other posters on this bus-stop.) And finally. DID  I
HAVE ID?

I didn't have ID. I showed my Voter's registration card which showed I lived
four blocks away from where this happened and was a responsible, voting
citizen.  I showed my credit cards.  I showed my ID from when I went to grad
school in Boston.  I showed my Medicaid card.  I was getting desperate,
running out of cards...  A NYC Public Library Card (where you REALLY have to
give good proof that you are a resident)...  A Blockbuster Video card...This
was getting ridiculous.

The cop kept saying, JUST SHOW US YOUR LICENSE MA'AM!  WE NEED A PICTURE ID.

I said that I had no driver's license.  That I don't drive.  That it was
probably inadvisable for me to drive because of some medication I was on.

Finally they giave me back all my stuff all messed up and I had trouble
putting it back into my wallet neatly.  They told me I couldn't leave
because they had to see if I was telling the truth when I said there wasn't
a warrant out for my arrest.  I decided to make this as theatrical as
possible.  This was right by the entrance to Barnard College, where college
students come in and out all the time, even at 9pm.  I move slightly beyond
the gates, and stand up against the wall with my hands up.  The cops look
happy.

People ask what they got me for.  I know I can't joke around but it will be
enough to say the straight truth. "I put a poster up on a bus-stop.  It's
against the law."  No one can believe this as almost every college student
has, at one time, put a poster on the bus-stop.  Sometimes I say, "they say
I can spend a night in jail for this."

During the checking process, which seems to take forever, the cops needle
me, "better go out and get that ID.  I mean, if you'd had ID it would be one
thing, but
without it  we're bound to wonder if you are who you said you are..."
[personally, I thought that giving them every card in my wallet told my
life's story much more than a driver's license would have.  I also thought
that the US didn't require citizens to carry ID, unlike France, where I had
also lived, and rarely had carried ID anyway, because the cops were
nicer...]

Finally, they find out that I really don't have a warrant out for my arrest
and am not violating the terms of my nonexistent parole etc., and they let
me go but not without a stern lecture about my criminal behavior.  I was
terrified throughout the process.  Once they leave, I am still in shock, but
angry, too.  How dare they go around harrassing young women who've done
almost nothing wrong.  Why didn't they go and arrest the crack dealer who
works at the end of my street under the base of the Samuel J. Tilden statue?

I was tempted to ask them this (and I have never taken an illegal drug in my
entire life) but THANK GOD I didn't because they would have interrogated me
on how I knew there was a crack dealer there and how often I bought from him
and what he charged etc., and they never would have believed the true
explanation which is that I live in an apartment that overlooks that statue.

Anyway, I'm sure the crack dealers pay the cops a percentage of their income
so the cops certainly won't ever close them down.......

Incidentally, if the cops were using profiling when they stopped me, it's
pretty strange profiling:  I'm white, 25-35, very overweight, dressed in an
ankle length skirt and matching sweater, with possibly a jacket, and
carrying a canvas bag (from a bookstore) with "the evidence" (they asked me
to show them the roll of scotch tape I had been using to commit the crime,
as well as the posters).  What kind of crime is mostly committed by middle
class out-of-shape young white women?  I told this story to a black friend
and he said, laughing, "They did that to a white woman?  With the way you
dress?" and proceeded to tell me he always got that kind of treatment from
cops, from the time he was twelve, even if he dressed real nice (then they
wanted to know how he could afford to dress nice....)

So I am scared of the cops for another reason (disability-related) and
scared of them because they stopped me for almost no reason and threatened
me with jail and now that I'm trying to write (and hopefully get published),
maybe my writings could make me a terrorist.  I mean I used to be free to
write that Bush obviously doesn't know how to fight a guerrila war, and that
he should receive some training in one of those Al-Quaida camps before he
shuts them all down, but now, were such a thing to appear in an articles,
poems, or prose poems by me, I'd have to deny every having writing them, now
that I've been taught by those Enron guys how to take the Fifth and get away
with it...

For the record, I never wrote the last paragraph.  I never even thought up
the last paragraph.  The last paragraph is a figment of your imagination.
But you never thought it either, dear email reader, because I'd hate to see
you in the outdoor cell next to mine in Guantanamo Bay.  Do you think we'd
be allowed writing paper?  How about reference books?  What if we requested,
through the Red Cross, a complete copy of the poems of Allen Ginsberg?  I
don't even like all his poems, but he'd be real good poet to have if you
were in jail.  Would we get an expurgated version, without all the dirty
words?  Would they go so far as to get rid of dirty acts even if they did
not have any dirty words in them?  After all, homosexuals are all
terrorists, aren't they?  Not only do they hide explosive material in their
assholes, but it turns them on, and when they die, it's just one big orgasm
before the afterlife where they have eternal reward for getting rid of Baby
Bush.

Millie

P.S.  I hope people can recognize a) sarcasm and b) words that are written
not in my voice, but in the voice of the oppressor

I think the whole series of events have moved so fast that they've all been
left "stranded", confused, and shocked. The super-right have carried out a
brilliant Reichstag burn-down: next you'll have a semi-Soviet
Russian-Hitlerian-Nazi military-industrial system: people will start to
diseappear and people will stop questionning where they've gone: the CIA etc
will probably crack down on emails next. Could even shut down this List as
being "subversive". Wouldnt surprise me. If I was a US citizen I would be
very frightened. But fear can be channeled and controlled. And one would
have to protest (or organise active revolution against) or versus the
fascists who are running the US just now..Richard.

 Jerusalem's High Cost of Living
 Bitar (Uncivil Liberties, AFF 2000) takes us on a densely packed journey
to Jerusalem in order to return to his family origins and to investigate
the current cultural climate. He captures the general chaos of the first
few hours of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, including scenes of waiting in the
hospital for news of the wounded and the dead. He juxtaposes the murderous
 sensibility expressed by some Israeli youth with the random shooting of
Osama Jadah as he was on his way to the hospital to give blood. Osama
appears in Looking Awry (AFF 2001) only one week before he was killed.
 preceded by Still We Struggle  directed Salwa Hassan Al Suwaidi
UAE/2000/Video/12 min
 Designed as a fundraiser/solidarity tool, this look at the second Intifada
>from the eyes of the United Arab Emirates includes interviews with
bullet-ridden and disabled Palestinians (including Mohammed Dorah's father
in the hospital just after his son's murder).

 March Tuesday 12 at 7:30pm

 CITIZEN BISHARA, Simone Bitton/ 2001/Video/52min
 Dr. Azmi Bishara, head of the National Democratic Assembly, philosopher,
and Member of Knesset, was the first Palestinian-Arab candidate for Prime
Minister of Israel in the elections of May 1999.  Interviews with Bishara
conducted by the Israeli media reveal the range of treatment he is
afforded: >from racist astonishment at his insight and intellect to blatant
 demonization and violent silencing. Recently this political witch-hunt
against Bishara has reached a new climax  The full Knesset has voted to
revoke his parliamentary immunity. Israel's attorney general filed two
indictments against him: an "incitement to violence" and "support for a
terrorist organization for affirming in public the internationally
recognized
 right of an occupied people to resist occupation and to struggle for
self-determination and a second indictment accusing him of "abetting
illegal exit from the country." for organizing humanitarian visits to Syria
for elderly Palestinian citizens of Israel who have been forcibly separated
from their refugee family members for over 50 years. Both trials are due to
commence in February 2002.
 Preceded by THE ACCUSED, a BBC Production/2001/video/45min
 "The Accused" makes the legal case that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon
should be tried as a war criminal based on his complicity in the massacre
of thousands of Palestinian women, children, and unarmed men in the Sabra
and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. The documentary has sparked
international condemnation of Ariel Sharon and has led, in part, to
 bringing the legal case of charging him with war crimes to the Belgium
courts.

What I think you are "pointing" at is the way that Dworkin's "discoveries"
of names hidden inside the text etc indicate or signal a system ow way of
reading (and writing) which has been around aong time: but is more
significant as we become more conscious of the writing/reading process...and
even if Dworkin's theories are nonsensical we can now think again about eg a
text that is ostensibly about fences and barriers and neighbours and
boundaries but can be read also from another "angle" as a coded message eg
to other poets or literary people...or that the very "bafflement" and
perplexity that people often feel when encountering a "difficult" poem for
the first time (which is mainly modern poems but could be any poem from any
era): is used as method.
   We then get a "higher" poetic or poetry turns around to its hieratical or
near-theophanic origions as a kind of deep mystery only for the initiated:
the priests of poetry...this may be good or it could step us closer to
elitism and/or  "the unintelligibility of truth"...Regards, Richard

Don't you also think, that if you try hard enough, you can extract any
meaning out of any text through the methods describe by Dworkin (I am reying
on Jullich's report of Dworkin's talk)?  I started out in math, and it just
seems to me that if the text is long enough and there are many words you'd
be satisfied with, those combinations are going to come up eventually...  I
just don't understand why it is supposed to be profound from a literary
point of view.  (There is a mathematical theorem which I do find profound
which says that any finite sequence of digits eventually comes out in the
digits of pi.  Now THAT is something else, much more meaningful than finding
authors names in their texts...)

There are of course texts in which authors DELIBERATELY hide their names (or
don't even hide them, but use them acrostically, for example) and that's
something different, though hardly something exciting from a modern point of
view.  If I understand what people are saying, it's the fact that the text
is "carrying" this other information, other than the text itself which is
supposed to be so interesting.  Again, from a mathematical point of view, we
are dealing simply with data.  The data is a list of letters (and spaces,
etc.)  More precisely, we might say it is a list of ASCII characters.  There
is no information in the text which is not in this ASCII representation of
it.  The list of numbers (65 for each upper case A for example) IS the text.
So the text cannot carry "extra" information other than the text.

Of course that is from a low level analysis.  We might also do a syntactical
analysis, breaking the text not into letters but into grammatical functions
(a la early Chomsky) or using a more modern system.  In that case, we come
closer to the poetry (though hardly close enough) but we can see neither
end-- no poetry, and no letters.  We do not know that "love" is spelt l o v
e, we know that sentence 1 starts with love in apostrophe "O love, thou art
..." (I am totally making up a text as I go along) and that of course love
is a noun (because the only a noun can fit in that grammatical position.

Unfortunately, that is the last kind of systematic analysis we can do.
There is vast research (in computer science and linguistics) on semantic
analysis, trying to make systems that can codify the meanings of something,
and they do pretty well, but they are nowhere near good enough to read a
poem by any definition of "read" that we'd be interested in.  There are
systems that can read a story and answer questions about it (this is a
classic work in computer science, and it was done a long time ago when hopes
for AI were high) but thirty years later no one can do that much better.

However, returning to Dworkin, my main point is that finding something in
the LETTERS of his poem that relates to the MEANING or AUTHORSHIP of the
poem is not that unlikely but it is sheer coincidence because once the poem
is analyzed sematically (either automatically in our brains or by a computer
in 50 or 100 years, I am pessimistic...), we aren't talking about letters,
we are at least talking about grammatical roles, to which we assign some
kind of meanings, to which we then assign roles in the greater meaning of
the whole poem, then, a step up, assign symbolic roles, we see that some
words and phrases are allusions and resolve the allusions, we notice
literary devices, then a few levels up we notice the difference between a
device being used because the author is writing in form and a device being
used ironically then we think about the whole poem-- doesn't it remind us of
another poem by the same author when he divorced his previous wife?  is he
about to divorce this one, too?  we know this is the lowest kind of
sleuthing and not criticism at all, but something takes us to the biography
and we find we are right...hehehehe we are cleverer than he was...unless
this was a coded message to his readers-- no that  way madness goes....back
to the poem, isn't it a bit facile?  maybe he's already too famous to write
a good poem? (wouldn't that be a problem I wish I had-- too famous a poet to
write a good poem.  not only won't it ever happen to me but I'll use the
idea in a poem some day....)  ok, so what does that "it's" on line seven
refer to? we try some possible referents, they seem plausible, but how can
we know?  what if the poet didn't know? maybe it refers to the whole
situation the poet is in?  didn't some German write a paper on Anaphors With
Multiple Referents in Contemprary German Poetry?  Yes, it was in the MLA
journal.  How about Anaphors I am Too Lazy To Figure Out? guiltily, you
think of a college poetry class you taught in which the students all wanted
to be creative even though you were supposed to teach them to read, not
write...  they wanted the creativity to ooze into them somethow.  they
wanted to dress like poets because they were taking your course.  they were
much taken aback, and some dropped, thank god, when you walked in wearing a
button-down shirt...anyway, you were reading Yeats, it was the one with
Helen walking along the battlements of Troy before the war started as the
troops amassed, and you asked them what "it" referred to...a few hands flew
up...the same hands as always...not the brightest hands, which were instead
attached to brains busy actually figuring out what "it" referred to...you
said...let's give everyone enough time to figure it out..but then none of
the good students raised their hands....groan..now you wished you could
answer the question yourself....you called on someone, at least you avoided
the tall, straight-haired shiny blonde girl with the long tresses who looked
to everyone like Helen until, realizing this, you painted a picture of a
GREEK beauty, fairly petite DARK beauty, beauty with a few years'
experience, smoky eyes, somewhat plump, you made yourself stop fast as you
realized you were describing a particular Hellenic babe who had broken your
heart at about age twenty and not the type in general...but isn't the
general type illustrated by an exemplem...you are letting yourself go too
far...must talk to therapist about this...and what the hell were you going
to describe next, her shapely thighs...it wouldn't do, would it, now? so now
your daydreaming, (well at least it wasn't wet-dreaming) has slowed the
class for a second so you say, "has anyone else con-tem-plated the mystery
of this 'it'?" no one...ok, Sam, what do you think the "it" refers back
to?...he looks eager...I hate to hurt him..."the whole situation,
sir"...before you can stop yourself you have emitted a Bronx cheer....Sam is
explaining his theory....well, see Paris feels this way, and he feels that
way, and if does this, then that. so then when it says....you apologize,
something you were taught never to do in the one-week classroom management
course in grad school which was the extent of your pedagogy
training....you're really sorry...but this is Yeats, and what you said would
make sense if you were out with your friends and said "it sucks!'...some
tittering...the old codger has heard the expression "it sucks"...do they
wonder whether you know what it means? so I vow to make sure of the referent
of the "it's" on line seven before I'm done.but here's something
interesting, the voice appears to change...is that the voice of the kind of
person he's been criticising so far, come to speak directly with him...let's
read ahead a little to see if it could be...no, it's a literal person,
temp-pis, I always am more amused when abstractions start talking back in
poems, sometimes it's hilarious, almost as good as that scene in Annie Hall
at the movie line where some pretentious jerk is saying "McLuhan said" and
then Marshal McLuhan appears out of nowhere an taps the guy on the shoulder
and says "Excuse me, I'm Marshall McLuhan, and I said nothing of the sort"
Wait a minue? Why am I thinking about Woody Allen?  I hope he hasn't gotten
into the text of the paper I'm writing, or even my notecards...maybe I'm too
tired to think.  I know what I'll do....   I'll look to see if I can find
the name of the poet anywhere in the text of the poem and since the poem is
book-length, I can probably do it...then I'll found a school of criticism on
this process only I will make sure to ban anyone who has ever taken a
statistics course from coming to my lectures....it will be the newest hoax
in literary theory....

the point is that throughout all this THE LETTERS OF THE POEM ARE NOT BEING
READ; the poem has long sinced ceased to be read as letters, as anything
read several times will cease to consist of letters (except to the very
young and the barely literate) generally, even the first time you read
something you never notice an individual letter, unless some very bizarre
type face is in use or there is a spelling error

any correlation between the letters of the poem any semantic information in
it, or information at any higher level up the analysis tree, is
coincidental, or else planted there deliberately by someone wanting either
to entertain, drive insane, or play a hoax on critics

Beginnings of an essay ready to be abandoned



Elsewhere i've written about the characters I use as emanants or source-
less semiotic spews that coagulate as characters, take on a life of their
own - one that I follow with insistence. They also form a bypass or excuse
- if I want to say something childish or out-of-sorts; if I'm in a bad
mood - if I want to present something dubious, something erroneous - I can
call on Nikuko or Jennifer - none of them care...

These people help, but they also get in the way. My main concern is philo-
sophy, not literature; I want my work to be taken seriously as theoretical
thought. In Nietzsche's time, or Kierkegaard's, both branches might well
intertwine, as they do in Derrida for example. But there's a cost involved
- a general referentiality to the dominion of the philosophers or theor-
ists - which is absent in my work, as Julu, for example, will have a
spirited conversation with Jennifer in a MOO. Who can untangle both the
stylistic and application involved - not to mention the sentiment? One can
write all one wants about postmodernity, virtuality, subjectivity, epis-
temology, ontology, and so forth - but one must do this through the proper
channels...

My dreams aren't full of them - not even Jennifer, the first - not even
Alan. Instead there are shattered and strobed screens, prompts as part-
objects, control passages and program transformations. I think of floating
signifiers, sememes with contusions, shattered commands I don't quite
understand. Among other things these are the deconstructions of avatars,
breakdowns of characters: bones. Out of the dreams other assemblages
arise, heading towards language, program, text.

I can always fall back on the dreams - against the logics of genre, for
example. It's that logic of the unconscious again. I'll use programs -
collectively called "julu programs" - as catalysts. I wrote the following
- you can see how disordered everything is - I'll read axiomatics, the
care and Kehre of reasoning - then turn - Mobius strip - anyway I wrote
the following just this evening in another context:

"Here's a major point for me. I've never been that interested in poetry or
literature/style generators, mainly because I'm interesting in a kind of
writing of urgency or writing that insists on a semantic world or
"sememe." I'm not that interested in abstraction per se which - for me -
underlies generated work. I'm trying to work out philosophical issues,
issues dealing with virtuality, etc., and so generation - unless it were
revealing something about language itself - isn't that interesting to me."

"That being said (sorry I'm writing awkwardly - I'm dizzy from some
medication) - when I first programmed, it was on a Texas Instruments 59
calculator with 1k of programming space, and one of the things I did was
make a text generator with maybe 100 words in it. There was a lot of very
very (for me) tight programming; it was all indirect addressing and
abbreviation to fit it in. But it ran and produced a series of texts. What
I did learn about through this was the way structure works (as well as
indirect addressing) in relation to language -"

"And _that_ being said - I tend to use the programs for catalysts, almost
for revealing sub-texts or the unconscious of my own thinking - which I
can then rewrite, tease out - this is a process of reworking, abandoning,
re-arrangement, etc. None of the programs is used for "pure" output; it's
all mixed, a mish-mash."

"Of course, even doing that - the reworking - I tend to learn more about
the subject at hand, and my own role or placement within it. And of course
that being said, I try to eliminate my own bias, or to extend it - play
around with the phenomenological reduction."

"There is also the energy used in reworking the syntax and vocabulary of
the various programs - that's another kind of study or summarization of my
current work - I'll need 43 nouns, 22 verbs... I can write this as a
semantic field in itself - a way of dis/organizing the domain -"

Poets seem averse to state program
By Carlos Alcal=E1 -- Bee Staff Writer
Published  5:30 a.m. PST Wednesday, Feb.  6, 2002

The Beat poets are not beating down the door. The Formalists are not
forming lines (except of verse).
Even confessional poets aren't admitting great interest.
California's newly established poet laureate program has run into a problem.
Not enough poets -- just seven -- have thrown their hats into the
ring as nominees for the two-year office that was established last
year to promote poetry in the state.
"I wouldn't say we're in a panic," said Adam Gottlieb, spokesman for
the California Arts Council, "but we're close."
The Arts Council has just extended the nomination period to Feb. 19,
in hopes of getting a few more nominees.
More candidates, but not just anybody.
"We don't want someone to nominate their brother just because he's a
nice guy and has done a few poems," Gottlieb said.
The last state poet, who held the office for three decades until his
death in 2000, was just such an amateur.
Assemblywoman Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, sponsored the successful
bill that established the new program. It requires a laureate to have
a substantial body of critically accepted work.
It's unclear why there haven't been many nominees. The problem
couldn't be verse.
The state of poetry in the state of California is strong, with many
acclaimed poets residing here. Former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Hass
is here, as are Philip Levine, Gary Snyder, Adrienne Rich, Sandra
McPherson, Gary Soto and many others.
The problem might be that being poet laureate takes a lot of time and
doesn't earn a lot of money, said Jack Hicks, former head of the UC
Davis creative writing program and a member of the committee that
will review nominees.
"It may be that people at the level of a Gary Snyder, or a Robert
Hass, or an Adrienne Rich, or a Wanda Coleman are busy writing or
teaching," Hicks said.
Though the law establishing the program doesn't designate an amount,
Hicks said the laureate won't get but a few thousand dollars as a
stipend.
"They could easily make that in two (unofficial) readings, and it
would take less of their time," he said.
Ray Tatar of the council's poet laureate program is still optimistic
a good nominee will be named.
The existing nominees have been strong and diverse, and include
suggestions made by a university president and a middle school
teacher, Tatar said.
"It's going to be an exciting horse race," he said.
When all the nominations are in, the committee will review them and
then send three names to Gov. Gray Davis, who will make the final
appointment.
The plan is to name the new state laureate in April, National Poetry
Month, and have the poet begin the first two-year term in July.
=46irst, however, the state needs additional nominations.
"The more the merrier," Tatar said.

Subject: Parataxis book launch


Please forward to interested parties:

Drew Milne invites you to a book launch and poetry reading for two new
titles from Parataxis Editions:

John Wilkinson, Signs of an Intruder, 44 pp., (£3.00, or $5 US dollars)
Nancy Cunard, Parallax, 24 pp., (£4.00, or $7 US dollars.)

in the Graham Storey Room, Trinity Hall, Cambridge, Thursday 14th February,
7.30 pm.

John Wilkinson will read Signs of an Intruder, and a mystery guest will read
from Parallax.

Hektor Rottweiler tells me that John Wilkinson's new sequence of poems
combines lyric insolvency, provocation and an extended largesse that defies
description, moreover, that it is one of his best books in, oh, ages. For
anyone interested in twenty-first century writing, it is a sign indeed of
where we are and where we are going, without a copy of which no-one should
be.

He also suggests cause for celebration in the re-issue of Nancy Cunard's
modernist classic PARALLAX, an extended poem that turns acerbic and plangent
eyes on motifs made familiar by Eliot's sad old Prufrock and then muddled up
in the waste bin. This is the first re-issue of a chapbook first
published by Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Press in 1925. Copies of the original
are as rare as osprey's teeth and sell at inflated prices to severe
specialists in the train-spotting fraternity of modernist book collectors.
Essential for an understanding of the development of modernist poetry in the
1920s, the real surprise is that the poem has moments of quality that ought
to make the more dogged critics among us blush at their historicist musings.

In short, the launch promises to be a night to remember, and there will be
wine.

Both pamphlets are set in Gill Sans Bold, and sport the white on red livery
first seen on the cover of PIG CUPID: homage to Mina Loy, a few copies of
which are still available on request.

Copies of SIGNS OF AN INTRUDER and PARALLAX are on sale now at £3.00 and
£4.00 respectively, and both pamphlets can be bought as a pair at a special
introductory rate of £6.00 including postage and packing within the UK, or
to the US for $12 US dollars, by sending a cheque made payable to 'Drew
Milne' to Trinity Hall, Trinity Lane, Cambridge CB2 1TJ. Prices in euros on
request.

PARATAXIS EDITIONS will be bringing out a new edition of the journal
PARATAXIS: modernism and modern writing, in March, price £5.00. Advance
orders gratefully received.

I suspect what is going on is reminiscent of Bertrand Russell's position for
the duration of World War II.  Russell was an ardent pacifist.  But he
renounced his passivism during that war because he understood how grave was
the Nazi threat.  When the war ended, he reverted and became an important
voice in the "ban the bomb" movement.

Unlike the Vietnam civil war into which the U.S. inserted itself, this latest
conflict involves an attack on U.S. soil, and the deliberate killing of
civilians by forces who call for the death of all "Americans."  The situation
also suggests that extreme positions, whether right or left, have much in
common with each other.  The Taliban, for example, is as far right wing as it
gets.  Yet they elicit sympathy (Afganistan = killing fields, WTC = we had it
coming) from some on the left, as if any group that targets Capitalism is
ipso facto left of center, or at least to be understood and forgiven.  Many
on the left are suspicious of the "impuse buying" and moral relevatism that
characterizes some of the rhetoric on their side of the fence.  The left wing
has always rooted its positions in a firm moral code, so moral relevatism
doesn't quite fit their bill.

Most of my friends on the left (i.e., those who support socialist ideals,
gender and racial equality, a woman's right to choose, and so forth) see the
threat as twofold.  First is the fire from extreme right and left wing groups
here and abroad.  Second is the "creeping fascism" in our own country, the
exploitation by Bush and company of civilian fear for the purpose of
extending their own power and control.  It's a mess, to be sure.  The Nam was
cut much clearer, I think.

I'm reminded of something my wife once said to me:  "When you give your
affection and protection to weak people, expect that one day they will betray
you, precisely because they are weak."  Seems like an adequate overview of
the human condition.  I find it more and more difficult, as time stumbles
along, to leave my hat in any ring.  But didn't Marcel Duchamp fear and avoid
the group thing?  Yes he did.

Best, Bill

What you expereinced was the soft-edge of terrorism that the poor experience
throughout the world every day and especially black people or  in many
places Jewish people and others (paradoxically now Arabs as well) "Divide et
imperum":  the answer is peoples' struggle and organisation. I've been in
struggle against the police  (but of course like a guerilla fighter - or
terrorist if you want to use that term - one picks one's time and place: in
a revolution, struggle, or a protest or whatever there's no place for
excessive and silly "heroics" (although courage of a kind is neccessary),
and I've been very frightened of the police over here in NZ (where a cop is
currently on trial (private prosecution case) for murder by gunshot (the
defense are using a german expert who was a negotiator in the terrorist
attacks on the Olympic Games village in Munich in about 1975): and where
(NZ) my own son had his eye knocked out by a police baton. And I was
battoned in the face in 1981 in the protests gainst the Springbok Tour (that
is the tour of the South African(white) rugby players to New Zealand which
protest was lke a civil war over here, as rugby is more significant to New
Zealanders ..well its New Zealand's religion))...  But the police and you
(and our) army ARE the terrorists: you dont have to worry about Arabs:
you're father is probably a good man but now he is frightened and confused
by S11 etc but the US military-industrial complex ARE the terrorists: and
they should release everyone including John Walker Lind: clearly the judge
who refused him bail is a right winger if not under big political pressure
(and public misinformed redneck "opinion" (or brainwashing).
   The bourgeios state is maintained by terrorism or the threat of it: you
were mistreated by "terrorists": ie policemen. By the way you dont have to
give your identity: or you didnt prior to S11(since when draconian laws are
either afoot or in place WORLDWIDE ) unless you are being arrested which you
wernt. They acted illegally: and they acted like the scum they mostly are

Alan. More interesting stuff: but to "butt in" what do you think of Craig
Dworkin's "talk" with the coded names etc? Ok its been filtered thru Jeffrey
Jullich (who did a good job of reporting I'll add) or do you think its all a
waste of time and that Craig D. was talking a load of old cobblers? Its
about the only "dialogue" -the much vaunted diaologic- albeit rather
stumblingly and confusedly proceeding - for the nonce on the List. You
obviously have a very complex structure which you have fairly complexly
"maped out" with long and short waves and to put it very crudely the
"technical" and the "cybernetic" integrate or jar againgst the personal and
the human and the often disturbing (political, social, medical etc) in your
own writings  (or texts or whatever) which often just verge on not working
but do work by the energy and sometimes ingenuity and even lyricism as well
as repetition...but that said:  do you have a comment on the Carig Dworkin
issue: or is it true that the most important clue is the hair style he had
that day?  (I'm not "taking the piss" out of you Alan: just thought you
might find this interesting or at least amusing...)

  Whether he was Moosing or mousing around or using stylo or whatever or
whether he dipped his head in a huge bucket of literary and blackly
obfusycating ink just prior to his talk to such literary "luminaries" of NY
as Charles Bernstein and the much alarmed Monsieur Jullich? I visualise him
from this grey and distant land as standing there like a Baudelaire (who
once died his hair green) or a kind of latter day Paganini-Critic or a
Genius with his hair so terrified of the electric power of the brain beneath
it (the hair in question) that it stood up en masse in protest at the
outrageous and alien and e'en transgresive thoughts issueing from (or
boiling in and around beneath) or in electric and (yeah) (verily) (eclectic)
terror and glowed in a bright blue or even with a flaming and  a ruddy (I
mean vermilion) irridescence? Your (levitic or serious) response si'l vous
plais. Regards, Richard.

Spiral Bridge Writers Guild requests your presence as we present another night of reverberations of the soul...

Please join us on
Saturday, February 9, @ 7pm

.. for a private performance by the Spiral Bridge poets when we gather to go back to basics for two hours. Relate to your own life through the harvests of someone else's, and find your place somewhere between the listening ear and the voice that employs it.
Come and allow yourself to be reminded why you are here, why you were there, and why you will be as bare bones are exposed and all else but words falls away. We shall surely be reminded why it is we take the time to gather after all.

Have a Good One.

I posted the CA poet laureate nomination stuff earlier.

go to this web site, get the info, & write a letter:
http://www.cac.ca.gov/secondary_page/programs/Descriptions/poetlaurate.htm

The problem is the NOMINATOR has to put together an application packet, and
must have some sort of academic or otherwise "official" affiliation.

Street. The exhibit will move to the American Library in Paris, 10, rue
G=C3=A9n=C3=A9ral-Camou, from March 19th through May 3, 2002. In Paris on M=
arch 20th,
there will also be a presentation as part of the library=E2=80=99s Evenings=
 With A
Writer program called =E2=80=9CAlice B. Toklas, In Her Own Voice,=E2=80=9D =
featuring
excerpts from a rare 1952 interview with Toklas.

Items in the exhibition will be from the Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas
Collection of San Francisco collector, Hans Gallas. First editions of The
Alice B. Toklas Cookbook, hand-written recipes, original photographs by Car=
l
Van Vechten, and letters will be displayed. One of the highlights of the
exhibit is a 19th century autograph book once belonging to one of Alice=E2=
=80=99s
childhood friends in which Toklas wrote a brief inscription. There will als=
o
be a painting commissioned for the event from the artist Tom Hachtman, titl=
ed
=E2=80=9CIn the Memory of Alice B. Toklas=E2=80=9D.The exhibit, which is cu=
rated by Gallas,
will be arranged around distinct themes including Alice the Cook; Alice the
Muse; Alice the Letter Writer; Alice Alone; and Alice the Legacy. One secti=
on
will feature the evolution of The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas by
Gertrude Stein, from its serialized version to bestseller.

Other events are also planned as part of the celebration. Restaurants in Sa=
n
Francisco and Paris are being contacted to include menu items from Alice=E2=
=80=99s
cookbook. Watch gertrudeandalice.com for further details.In the Fall of 200=
2,
to culminate the Toklas birthday year, a reading of a new one-person play
about Toklas, "Cooking With Alice B," will be presented in the Koret
Auditorium of the San Francisco Public Library. The play is based on an
original idea by Hans Gallas and written by Gallas with Lissa Tyler Renaud.
It is set in a 1950's San Francisco television studio. Toklas has been
invited to prepare some dishes from her now famous cookbook. The role of
Alice is played by Ms. Renaud, an award-winning actress and director. There
are also plans for future readings of the play and a full production.

As the life partner of Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas both experienced the
lifelong struggles and celebrity of one of the foremost shapers of 20th
century literature and modern art. She also contributed immeasurably to the
development and recognition of Stein=E2=80=99s work. In her own right, Alic=
e has at
some level come to symbolize the openness, freedom, and creativity born of
the =E2=80=9Clost generation=E2=80=9D of the =E2=80=9820s and perpetuated b=
y the Beats of the =E2=80=9850s
and the Hippies of the late =E2=80=9860s/early 70s. Rightly or wrongly, muc=
h of this
mythology centers around the infamous recipe for her brownies/fudge first
printed in her 1954 cookbook.

The devoted relationship of Alice and Gertrude has come to stand for a key
milestone in gay/lesbian history, with TIME magazine (founder Henry Luce an=
d
his wife Claire Boothe were good friends of Alice and Gertrude) having term=
ed
it one of the great love affairs of the 20th century. 2007 will mark the
100th anniversary of the meeting of Gertrude and Alice. Preliminary plans a=
re
underway to coordinate an international symposium commemorating this
significant event.

There is no shortage of information online about Gertrude Stein and Alice B=

Toklas. Whether there are specific web sites devoted to one or both or site=
s
which highlight projects inspired by them or sites selling items related to
them, Gertrude and Alice are easily found on the world-wide web. Their
biographies, vital dates, and bibliographies will not be repeated here =E2=

though we=E2=80=99ll gladly help direct you to them.

The primary purpose of gertrudeandalice.com is to provide a site which
recognizes the importance of this almost four-decade long partnership.
Much of what Gertrude Stein accomplished could not have been done without
Alice B. Toklas. Much of what Alice B. Toklas accomplished could not have
been done without Gertrude Stein. Stein has received much deserved
recognition and analysis over the years while Toklas has received some, but
too little of either. Often her claim to fame is couched in the mythology o=

the hashish fudge recipe!
It is time for a new word =E2=80=93 gertrudeandalice. Its definition - one =
of the
goals of this web site will be to define it.

>
> a topic of interest to me. also of interest: the distinction and intersection of play and
> game. relates to "art and gaming". Play is not necessarily gaming. But there is play in
> gaming. And there are different types of play, 'art' being involved most prestigiously in
> non-game play, previously. the challenge of the artgame is to be as widely playful as
> possible, in artplay, soundplay, bodymindplay, readingplay, writingplay, imageplay,
> competitiplay, communiplay, transactiplay, metaplay, and many more. some might add
> enaughtyplay, for instance. uh, that would be bodymindplay.
>
> Arteroids has many of these in it.
>
> The bodymindplay is in the keyboard interface and how that feels. To play and game. Arteroids
> will have a 'play mode' and a 'game mode' (rather than canto 1, canto 2). In game mode, when
> you expire once, the game is over because if you expire there's no way you are going to get
> the score you need to advance to the next level--there is no point in continuing. To advance
> to the next level you have to score quite well. And if you advance, that takes you directly to
> the next level of play. You can also choose to exit game mode and enter play mode. In play
> mode, you can expire many more times before the game ends. And in play mode you can adjust the
> app's velocity, density, and friction, whereas these are not adjustable in game mode.
>
> In play mode, there is no linear advancement of the player through hierarchical levels, though
> the player can adjust velocity, friction, and density. Instead, the player can jump around to
> whatever level they wish whenever they wish, and they can edit text, create their own texts to
> use in arteroids (and save them to disk), change (v,f,d) before the game or during the game,
> make their own poems and play them through the interface, read the help, view the credits, and
> perhaps other things. The play mode, given that it can be set to the player's own velocity and
> physical capabilities with a keyboard, is more amenable to artplay.
>
> Further, when the game's velocity is low, you can read the text. And you will have more
> opportunity to choose the sounds you play, so you can play musically with the interface more
> leisurely at low velocity, so you create a kind of visual totally textual and sound poem. This
> is very much artplay. It would be great to be able to record games and send them to people as
> screensavers. Perhaps I can get it to email texts, (v,f,d) settings, and a url to the game.
> Hmm.
>
> The game mode will have 216 levels. That's a lot of levels in a computer game. But each game
> is quite short. Anywhere from a minute to half a minute. Or shorter if you expire. Which you
> will do often. The progression of the levels is interesting. I mentioned (v,f,d) previously. v
> for velocity. f for friction. d for density. Think of (v,f,d) as a tape counter such as you
> see on your stereo. But in (v,f,d), the wheels don't all have the same symbols on them. I am
> advancing the idea of (v,f,d) as a tape counter to illustrate how to count the number of
> possible configurations of (v,f,d).
>
> The v wheel has the numbers 1 to 12 on it. There are twelve velocity settings. 1 is reading
> speed and soundplay velocity. 12 is very challenging physically. v takes the 'hundreds' wheel
> position in (v,f,d).
>
> The f wheel has three numbers on it: 1, .2, 0 . f=0 means no friction for the id-entity, the
> player's text. You can control the player's speed and direction, but if you don't control it,
> it will zip around like the red text from hell and crash almost immediately. f=.2 means that
> there is a little bit of friction on the id-entity's motion. in other words, the id-entity
> will stop eventually if you take your hand off the keypad. f=1 means there is more friction
> yet on the id-entity. This is the most easily controlable friction setting. f takes the 'tens'
> position in (v,f,d).
>
> The d wheel has the numbers 1 to 6 on it. d is for 'density' in this case. There are six
> 'density' settings. d=1 means that the game phase list is [2,3,4,5,6,7,8] or something
> similar. This means that in phase 1 of the game, you are faced with 2 arteroids onstage. When
> you score high enough that you progress into the next phase (of the same game) then you are
> faced with three arteroids onstage at all times. and so on till you face 8 arteroids onstage
> constantly in the last phase until you score high enough to end the game, or fall back a phase
> if you expire in play mode and are resurrected. d=2 refers to the game phase list
> [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. d=3 refers to [4,5,6,7,8,9,10] ... d=6 refers to [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. d takes
> the 'units' position in the (v,f,d) 'tapecounter'.
>
> Now let us count the permutations and combinations of (v,f,d) where
>
> v is 1 to 12 (12 is the hardest velocity)
> f is 1, .2, 0 (0 is the hardest friction)
> d is 1 to 6 (6 is the hardest density at high velocity, and the easiest density at low v given
> the same scoring system for each game).
>
> when the tape counter is at its lowest setting, it says (1, 1, 1). These are the easiest
> settings for all three parameters. More generally, the below shows the enumeration of the
> possible settings.

> is a stir fry text called "Log" that means that there are approximately 3^30 configurations,
> or 205,891,132,094,649 logs.
>
> Let's step back a moment from arteroids and the stir fry texts and the enumeration of levels
> and permutations of texts and make a more general observation. What we are dealing with here
> are hyperstructures, trees of paths (typically) through a set of pages or states or levels or
> texts or permutations of texts etc. Functionally, the stir fry texts can be fit into the tape
> counter metaphor to enumerate the permutations. However, it makes little sense to display them
> in the above enumerative order. It is more fun that the 'wheels of the counter' turn
> independently of one another in the stir fry texts. That is part of the fun of them. And the
> wheels turn spastically, even better. They twitch with their own life.
>
> What use are these observations to the web.artist? Well, to get a sense of the combinatory
> space of one's creation is useful. It is also useful sometimes to consider the paths through
> the hyperstructures that one builds and have a sense of the shape of those paths collectively
> and individually, to some extent, though 205,891,132,094,649 is a large number. Sometimes it
> is useful, as in arteroids, to establish a linearly ordered hierarchy between the states--for
> use in game mode, in this case. In other situations, as in play mode in arteroids or the stir
> fry texts generally, such a linearly ordered hierarchy between the states is not useful and
> would in fact be a drag.
>
> I have thought of the above approach to conceptualizing the combinatoric shape of work in
> relation to some work by my friend Mez (http://www.hotkey.net.au/~netwurker ) that does not
> yet exist. The 'wheels of the tape counter' would contain textual entries, like the stir fry.
> Only, unlike the stir fry, the wheels would not turn independent of one another. And in fact
> the thing would be a textflesh machine. Mez's work is already interesting combinatorially.
> There are implicitly, in some cases, linearly ordered progressions of reading favored among
> the combinatorial possibilities. At other times there is a favored traversal of the tree of
> possibilities. At other times the order of the reading is open to full play. A piece involving
> Mez's voice and this sort of textflesh machine could be very interesting and could also both
> clarify and deepen the mechanics of mezangelle. But it is something that Mez would have to
> come to herself, concerning the specific mechanics of the literary machine, ie, the logic of
> the turning wheels and their transitions between states. I imagine it as being no longer than
> a single line of text. This would also highlight the way that some of Mez's work operates on
> the level of the line, not the paragraph--though of course we all operate in the paragraph at
> times too.
>
> I mention the above concerning non-existant work by Mez to illustrate how the tape counter
> metaphor is useful in conceptualizing a certain aspect of literary machines: their
> hyperstructures. Sometimes this is useful, sometimes not. Depends on o so many things.
>
> To return to discussing game and play mode, game mode often does involve an arrangement of the
> levels of play into a linearly ordered progression. Onward and upward. Not just inward amid
> the dimensions of artplay, soundplay, bodymindplay, readingplay, writingplay, competitiplay,
> communiplay, transactiplay, metaplay, and many more amid the cogitative multiplex. Play mode
> tends to the de-gamed in its removal of meaningful scores and game-designer imposed standards
> and levels of achievement. And it often though not always removes the competiplay. Usually it
> is quite big on soundplay, bodymindplay, readingplay, writingplay, communiplay, metaplay and
> even artplay. But not always. And, as in the non-existant Mez literary machines, sometimes
> play mode involves specific paths as favored readings or traversals or directions. Also, we
> might note that as in arteroids, a full range of original artplay can be combined with game
> mode in such a way as to elevate both.
>
> Another vector of the theory of game and play (and art); call it the playvector:
> (artplay, soundplay, bodymindplay, readingplay, writingplay, imageplay, competitiplay,
> communiplay, transactiplay, metaplay...)
> Consider it an n-dimensional vector that describes the state of the piece, at any point. It is
> a play vector. Let it bristle in all directions amid the Æ-dimensional multiplex of mind and
> body.
>
> The gameplay vector might include
> (artgame, soundgame, bodymindgame, readinggame, writinggame, imagegame, competigame,
> communigame, transactigame, metagame).
> The notion of artplay and artgame are not mutually exclusive and so will intersect yet also
> contain mutually exclusive elements.
>
> It is interesting where they intersect, and interesting also where they are mutually
> exclusive. Amid the areas where they are considered to be mutually exclusive are probably
> large regions of unexplored territory that are merely dangerous rather than truly mutually
> exclusive. Yet there would also be areas where more or less anybody would agree that they were
> mutually exclusive.
>
> I have outlined in the above some issues that arise in the confluence of {game, play}, {game,
> art}, and  {play, art}. The digital is a playful place. And can also be deeply artful. They do
> go together in strange and wonderful ways. Clearly it is not absolutely necessary that they be
> combined to create transformative, immersive, profound work. These are measures that depend on
> psychological and emotional reactions that are independent of the presence of game and play,
> to a certin extent.
>
> But should we speak of the confluence of arts, media, programming, and the experience of this
> confluence via the digital, the computer, which is something we drive, you can see the
> poetential delight and also relevance of game and play to art in the digital realm where

I didn't have any response; apologies. I'd want to have read the original
talk/essay - it's always different from the reporting of course, and for
that reason I wasn't following it. Again apologies - Alan

Hello!

I just wanted to invite any poets here from Southern California or formerly
from SoCal to participate in this event.  I should have the website up soon
and will post that to the list when it's up.

If you think you can make it, please RSVP to Amelie Frank at the e-mail
address at the end.

Cheers!
:-)

FWD:

Dear Fellow Poets:

The event we've been talking about for months is coming, and we want you to
be part of this historic project.

On Sunday, April 7, 2002, at 3:00 p.m., Beyond Baroque will host The Big
Picture, a convocation of Southern California poets to be photographed for
National Poetry Month.

Southern California is a region of diverse populations, each with a unique
voice. For this event, we are bringing all these voices together -- the
voices of our literary poets, our performance poets, our beat poets,
avant-garde poets, academic poets, hip-hop poets, environmental poets,
political poets, cowboys poets, and others. Often, regions are not aware of
their cultural heritage. This is our chance to preserve these poets for
posterity and awaken the Southern California region to the wealth of talent
that resides right here, right now!

The event will take place at Beyond Baroque, the nonprofit foundation that
is the literary heart of Los Angeles. Founded in 1968 in a storefront in
Venice, the center has been the site of readings from such literary giants
and local icons as Allen Ginsberg, Philip Levine, David St. John, Kate
Braverman, Lewis MacAdams, Bob Flanagan, Charles Bukowski, Wanda Coleman,
Dennis Cooper, and many more. Many of  SoCal's most beloved poets have been
alumnae of Beyond Baroque's long-standing workshops.

The event is being documented by Mark Savage, who is completing a five-year
project individually photographing the poets of Los Angeles.   Called one
of the "finest up-and-coming portrait photographers in North America" by
"American Photography," Savage has produced outstanding work that has
appeared in the "Los Angeles Times," "Money," "Fortune Small Business," and
other publications. After the group photo, all poets will be invited to
visit Mark Savage's completed project, "Souls and Passions," on display at
the Beyond Baroque gallery.

Participating poets are being asked to donate copies of their publications
to the Beyond Baroque Archive: the largest independent collection of
Southern California poetry and ephemera on the West Coast. Be it your
chapbooks, your broadsheets, your perfect-bound collections, your spoken
word recordings, or the literary magazines you have produced as publishers
and editors, we want them to enrich the archives and guarantee your
permanent legacy as part of Southern California's grand poetic tradition.
 Please bring them to the Big Picture event!

Why would any serious poet want to be Poet Laureate of a state?  Even if it
were not a
given that no state would be able to elect a valid laureate.  Being Poet
Laureate of the U.S. or Britain would at least garner some visibility.  And
states don't really vary much, anymore,
it seems to me.  I wouldn't mind being named poet laureate of American
mathematicians, or
of American substitute teachers, but I truly would not be interested in
being poet laureate of Florida, my home state now.  Of course, if I lived in
a place with a neat name, like Oshkosh, I wouldn't mind being poet laureate
of it.  Poet Laureate of Hayworth Road, Port Charlotte, Florida, wouldn't be
bad, either.

Bill.  I dont see it as you do but glad to see your view: I can understand
now the situation might seem (especially eg  to a New Yorker) and other
Americans as a terrible and frightnenning attack. And without a lot of info
(and even with a lot) a lot of people would be excused for being frightened
and angry at the events of the attack on the US. However I dubious that 1)
the attack wasnt justified ( I mean that it didnt have some complex causal
connection to US external policies and so on) 2) it wasnt organised by an
extreme right wing group from within the US  3) if it wasnt 2) then the Bush
(etc) admin reaction was quite simplistic: he now wants to "blister" Iraq
and probably North Korea. Altho I unerstand that te European nations arent
so keen on that). And also it (the attack on Afgahnistan) in no way has made
the "Free West" any safer. 4) I think its VERY much like theVietnam war.
   eg I think that the issue of the "advancedness" or whatever of
Afghanistan has been cruelly and cynically manipulated by the Right. It was
a "red herring" and served to reinforce prejudice against Arabs everywhere
as The Enemy (the NEW enemy) and what was relatively speaking a fairly minor
attack on basically non-military targets (recall the number of buildings in
the US and the enormous numbers of military installations). And no one has
claimed (in fact most Arabs have condemned the attacks) responsibility
(usually its obvious and in Isreal we know the terrorists (freedom
fighters?) because they kill themselves) - even if bin Laden hadn't claimed
to have organised it: there would been a  statement about the US: about how
corrupt and aggressive the military -industrial state is, how they are
aiding the Israelis, their general policy of "divide et imperum" which is
tiresomely old, and so on. You dont SEE how the rest of the world's poor see
the US: and increasingly it is seen as an agressive and corrupt nation. The
Space Program built up with the aid of the ex-Nazi terrorist von Braun, the
Nazis who escaped thru the "nets" with US aid after the Second WW, the
holding back of the US until Britain was crippled then a panic reaction in
case the Commmunists took everything, the savaging of Korea and Vietnam, the
killing of hundreds of thousands in South America and Indonesia and the
impoverishing of the Third World nations, coup detats in Chile (which was
becoiming "dangerously democratic"), and  Iran in case the oil fields
nationalised, the vicious and ongoing savaging of Iraq, military
installlations thousands of miles from the US (no other nation has the
equivalent) in Saudi Arabia (to protect whom, US oil interests, and a bunch
of scum in Kuwait?).
  This all said: if you can prove the case that a huge Arab force was
steaming toward the US and the need for an undeclared war on that very poor
country Afghanistan or why a huge bombing campaign complete with thousands
of B52 bomber isnt begun on the Palestinian "terrorists" or should that be
"Israeli terrorists?"  I'm not convinced the the US was in "great peril".
  But the reaction of the US has created in the long run the potential for
more destruction, more bitternness.
 But that said: I have to now allow that I'm glad you are commenting on this
issue. I will allow that I could be wrong: that's true. Otherwise there can
be no debate.. I allow that there is always rhetoric which obfuscates. Also
I hope my disagreement is not seen as callous indifference to S11 which was
a terrible event. Nor am I against American people who I think suffer from
the effects of capitalism as much as any people any where, and I am not
blind to the good things that have happenned in the US eg the Civil Rights
movement and so on, the art, the relative freedom, your constitution when it
works, and the strength of the people, the abundance (which we in NZ have
somewhat): the intelligence and insight as such literary figures as Zukofsky
( him as an example as I'm reading a book about him just now), the energy
and creativity of American people and so on. So I hope you accept my crit as
"objective" - well as far as objective can be objective. I'll accept a
"counter attack" without it becoming a personal thing: but I dont want to
back away fromn what I said above as it stands for now. Regards, Richard.

lighthouse
by M. Mara-Ann

        Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on April 15, 2002 of
lighthouse by M. Mara-Ann.


About the book:
        Sentence by sentence, line by line, lighthouse casts horizons. A possible
allusion to Virginia Woolf’s To The Lighthouse can be discerned in the sense
of suspense, of preparation and promise that pervades the text, a sense of
things underway. But that it is present excitement and expectation rather
than some terminus out in the future that is art’s (and life’s?) ultimate
achievement is clear from the outset. Of course, one can’t think of a
lighthouse without being aware of the slippage of its illumination and the
concealment that surrounds what’s revealed. A strange narrative -- a
narrative of the strangeness of what is -- comes into view. lighthouse is
about the experience of being on the way, distance by distance. We move from
part to whole and whole to part again, “the proximity unveiling a subtle
inquiry.”


About the author:
        Raised in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, M. Mara-Ann has called San
Francisco home for more than ten years. She completed undergraduate studies
at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the University of Linköping,
Sweden and partial graduate work at New College of California in San
Francisco. Recent work includes the chapbook forthcoming: ecneles (a+bend
press, 2000) and a CD collaboration with composer Sean Abreu entitled Water
Rights (2000). She is the publisher of WOOD, an online experimental journal
featuring collaborations between poets and visual artists. lighthouse is
Mara’s first book.


About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip’s Road. It is devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to
isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and curtail
its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama,
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and so
forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes;
lighthouse is volume 11. The project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian
and Travis Ortiz; the director for production and design is Travis Ortiz;
cover production and design is by Ree Katrak.

Just out from Spuyten Duyvil

and definitely worth immediately seeking out is

Psychological Corporations

by Garrett Kalleberg

42 pp., perfect-bound

with gorgeous cover art by Walter Sipser

"-The ambiguity of the stimuli. Stimuli are generally ambiguous and
visual. They are ambiguous because the description of a precise
photograph of, for example, a bottle of Guinness, would be likely
only to provide a response 'a bottle of Guinness' except among the
severely psychotic. To recognise these, no test would be required."
    -from Personality, the Psychometric View, Paul Kline
    (taken from Psychological Corporations=92 back cover)

http://www.metadada.com/content/psychcorps.html

The URL at Spuyten Duyvil (with no break between - and spuyten) for the boo=
k

p
age=3Dkalle.html&ORDER_ID=3D191895663

where you will find this intriguing description:

"The poems of Psychological Corporations challenge the limits and
excesses of rationality and its requisite objectification on the one
hand, and subjectivity as a state and as a condition, how ever
tenuously constructed, on the other hand, through the linguistic
medium of their equivocal interactions."

I have a copy in my possession, I highly recommend it.

Kevin Killian & Dodie Bellamy
At the Kootenay School of Writing
Kevin Killian Reading - Friday February 22nd 8pm
Dodie Bellamy Reading - Saturday February 23rd 8pm
Killian & Bellamy - Talks on Low Culture - Sunday February 24th 2pm
All events $5/$3/$0, at KSW:
201 - 505 Hamilton Street, Vancouver
604-688-6001


Low Culture:  Kevin Killian will speak about his fruitful interest in the
Australian pop princess Kylie Minogue ("Kylie Minogue and the Ignorance of
the West"), and the pros and cons of poetic and other collaboration. "Kylie
without genitals, or with the genitals of a little boy, as in Simon
Henwood's Darger imitations-naked but for a necklace, tiny tackle and all,
permitted only a kind of genital power and a spectral innocence." Dodie
Bellamy will then take the floor and read a brief riff on Kevin's talk, and
then she will launch into a discussion of sex and horror and feminist
theory. "To me transgression is a tedious position. But I *am* excited by
pushing the reader to the point where he or she cannot maintain a safe
distance from the work."

Kevin Killian, born 1952, is a poet, novelist, critic and playwright. He has
written a book of poetry, Argento Series (2001), two novels, Shy (1989) and
Arctic Summer (1997), a book of memoirs, Bedrooms Have Windows (1989), and a
book of stories, Little Men (1996) that won the PEN Oakland award for
fiction.  His new collection I Cry Like a Baby is just out from Painted Leaf
Books.  With Lew Ellingham, Killian has written many essays and articles on
the life and work of the American poet Jack Spicer [1925-65] and co-edited
Spicer's posthumous books The Train of Thought and The Tower of Babel (both
1994).  Their biography of Spicer, Poet Be Like God: Jack Spicer and the San
Francisco Renaissance was published by Wesleyan University Press in 1998.
Killian's work has been widely anthologized and has appeared in, among
others, Best American Poetry 1988 (ed. John Ashbery), Men on Men (ed. Geo.
Stambolian), Discontents (ed. Dennis Cooper), Best Gay American Fiction 1996
and 1997 (ed. Brian Bouldrey), and Word of Mouth: An nthology of Gay
American Poetry (ed. Timothy Liu).  For the San Francisco Poets Theater
Killian has written thirty plays, including Stone Marmalade (1996, with
Leslie Scalapino) and Often (2001, with Barbara Guest).  His next book will
be all about Kylie Minogue.

Dodie Bellamy, born 1951, is a novelist, critic and cultural journalist.
She has written a novel, The Letters of Mina Harker (Hard Press, 1998), a
collection of memoirs, Feminine Hijinx (Hanuman, 1990), an epistolary
collaboration on AIDS with the late Sam D'Allesandro, Real (Talisman House,
1994), and three chapbooks, Answer (Leave Books, 1993), Broken English
(Meow, 1996), and Hallucinations (Meow, 1997).  Just out from Tender Buttons
is a book of prose poems, Cunt-Ups, a radical feminist revision of the
"cut-up" pioneered by William Burroughs and Bryon Gysin. Bellamy's work has
been widely anthologized and has appeared in, among others, the anthologies
High Risk (Plume, 1991), The Art of Practice: 45 Contemporary Poets (Potes &
Poets Press, 1994), A Poetics of Criticism (Leave Books, 1994), The New Fuck
You (Semiotexte, 1995), Primary Trouble (Talisman House, 1996), and Moving
Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women (Talisman House,
1998).  One of the original "New Narrative" writers of the early and mid
80's, Bellamy has worked hard to bring together the sometimes disparate
paths of art, poetry and the novel, including a triumphant five-year stint
as director of the seminal San Francisco writing lab, Small Press Traffic.
In recognition of her efforts she won the prestigious Bay Guardian "Goldie"
Award for Literature in 1998.  Bellamy has also published journalism and
creative nonfiction in a wide range of publications including The Village
Voice, The San Francisco Chronicle, Bookforum, Out/Look, The San Diego
Reader, ZDNet Developer, Nest, as well as numerous small press literary
journals and web sites.  In addition, she has worked closely with the visual
artists Raymond Pettibon, Lutz Bacher, David Levinthal, Cecilia Dougherty,
Richard Hawkins, Peter Mitchell-Dayton, Caitlin Mitchell-Dayton, Phoebe
Gloeckner, Michelle Rollman, Sue de Beer, and Darrell Alvarez. With Kevin
Killian, Bellamy is writing a hybrid transgenre work of fiction and history,
Eyewitness, commissioned by Berkeley's Atelos Press.  She has written often
and vividly on contemporary literature, transgression, feminist and queer
theory, AIDS and body issues.  She is writing a new novel, The Fourth Form,
and editing a collection of her theoretical and critical essays.  With Kevin
Killian she has edited 98 issues of the San Francisco-based writing/art zine
they call Mirage #4/Period[ical]. Bellamy has taught creative writing at the
San Francisco Art Institute, UC Santa Cruz, University of San Francisco, and
the Naropa Institute.  She was the Distinguished Visiting Writer at Mills
College for two consecutive years.  Currently she is a lecturer in the
Creative Writing Department of San Francisco State University.  She also
leads a private prose workshop that's been running for the past nine years.

Kevin Killian, Probability Zero:

Talking to my friend Emily, whose drinking
the corpses change but the party goes on forever,
flat tax soars while it's true, I haven't yet seen vaccine
In the interim he's puffing up, like a large green bullfrog
on the lily pad of the hospice, wet eyes yellow and glaucous
burning holes through the visitor
Probability zero, but don't let a sordid fatalism
give you that Monica Lewinsky fifth amendment
until there's a cure, but from what deep pockets
does the money appear    When you're sick, the last
thing in the world is
Fit, the false falls into place, but sick
I don't know, but an erratic passion blows into our world
and I forget your name,
I don't know, where was I when everyone else I know
was getting bushwhacked, the bullshit of Clinton
In America, the probability's zero, -- like weather,
like the inane weathermen on Tv who tell you a
hot front and a cold front are moving into
a clearing, where I could be my "self,"
rituation normal
all fucked up, rnafu, or a "system is moving in"
and we're supposed to feign interest or terror
while "watching" the "weather"
as years ago Tim died, the man who, whom
I once thought the FALCON MALTESE of sophisticated
and he did not love me but I was not worthy
His black glasses shiny like something alive,
the way that men do,
the way cattle do. He had a vision
I longed to share. His body was not so
pre
possessing. Probability zero that I would live
and he, Tim, his student ID the cover on his book,
would study death before I got to do him
I like felt this stab in my head
a red explosion of blood vehicles, brain flack,
infinitely painful as little by little he
always integral to my sense of myself
as a possible poet began to disintegrate
away across the wide border red ribbon swath of the US
away from me and, in time,
away from kissing him 1979
ten minutes later he spotted a rainbow
even then hoary cliche of gay experiential camaraderie
but, yikes, real thin ribbon over Brooklyn
Look away, look away
this stormy river

from "Argento Series"
after Tim Dlugos and in his memory


Bellamy, Cunt-Up #21:

I consumed your biceps because my clit is hard and my nipples are poking up,
and I don't want to talk about it any more with you, my dear. So, how far is
your cock from my body parts and skull? You collect me like a pile of flesh
laundry and I fuck your mouth, then I put my dribbling cock inside you to
rid myself of skin. I sprayed and moved through you, electric, reflecting
the morning. I put my hand in your cunt and sleeping pills in your drink. I
want to possess the rest of your body but I can't so I take you down to the
basement, my cock is bigger and darker down there, then I dismember you and
sledge hammer your mouth, it is red and I kiss it. You asked me to be trashy
so I wadded my fist into a ball and tried to masturbate in from of you but
there just wasn't enough leverage. This brought back memories of you, my
victim, wet all the time these days. I'm boiling for you to sit inside my
cunt. I've painted your pussy several times, fondled it gently like a baby.
Suck my cock for I believe you to be in the vicinity of it, do it quickly
and viciously while I'm pinching you, your skull dotted with my squeeze
prints. Suddenly my thighs are black and blue-tell your cock to behave
itself! So my aureole is pale and my nipples are as long as you want them,
your saliva clinging to the end of my being, your fingers inside me. I lean
like a mosaic beside you, stay there fucking my clit and hole. I'm sucking
your clit, I'm sleeping in your cave, take care of me. I'm touching the page
you wrote, I'm tracing your come-font, will you come in my cunt all the time
like some fucking cum cow? Jealousy and property appall me but I don't mind
a little pain. In your fantasy you sway in the name of coming, you're so
generous, really. Is it okay that I ask to coil at the root of your tree? Is
my clit still burning away the ozone? I will build a century for you and me.
You held it with both hands then you used cries to make me shoot off in your
cave, I turned red as a morning sunrise, it's so exciting, no way out, I'm
hot for you in a rental car, hope burst its binding in my ravenous wet
pussy. I'm straining and gushing, thinking of you, a thousand years of
emotion and you fucking me, you knowing my teeth pressed together, you
kneeling over me and I was yours, that more than anything, my wanting.

The Beat poets are not beating down the door. The Formalists are not
forming lines (except of verse).
Even confessional poets aren't admitting great interest.
California's newly established poet laureate program has run into a problem.
Not enough poets -- just seven -- have thrown their hats into the
ring as nominees for the two-year office that was established last
year to promote poetry in the state.
<snip>
My faith in poetry and poets is renewed.





...I am a real poet. My poem
is finished and I haven't mentioned
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call
it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES.

Special feature for _Jacket_ magazine: Bruce Andrews and the Politics of
_Lip Service_

Reading literary criticism is rarely an eerie experience, but here's an
exception:

          Not many days after the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center,
the New York Times
          ran an article discussing the structure of the building and the
possibilities of its being
          brought down by a larger and more thoughtfully placed explosion.
It turns out not to be
          easy: apparently, each tower is built to withstand the impact of
a fully loaded jet liner
          taking off. In addition to the strength of the structure,
attackers would have to confront
          its complexity: there are twenty-one load-bearing pillars and
they could not be reached
          simultaneously by the force of an explosion. In being destroyed,
a particular section
          would in fact shield other areas by absorbing the impact. The
timing and placement of
          the article is interesting in itself: it was a rapid-response
anodyne to the spiral of
          geopolitical urban trauma while at the same time, under the cover
of a discussion of
          engineering, it invited its readers to participate in
transgressive calculations of how the
          Trade Center towers might actually be brought down.

The essay from which this opening paragraph is taken is Bob Perelman's
"Building a More Powerful Vocabulary: Bruce Andrews and the World (Trade
Center)," written in the same year as the first, failed attempt to blow up
the twin towers. By now its resonance has been widely remarked upon in the
poetry circles where Andrews' work continues to serve as a limit-case of
formal radicalism. The purpose of the present call for work is twofold: to
reflect on, complicate, and analyze further Perelman's structural metaphor
in its application to Andrews' writing; and to consider, from the present
historical juncture, the always vexed issue of the politics of Andrews'
poetics, with special reference to his latest book, _Lip Service_ (2000), a
massive recasting of Dante's _Paradiso_. Roberto Tejada observes recently
that "Andrews has produced multiplying rhetorical worlds wherein
image-making and language use--as potentials in the aesthetic sense--have
rarely appeared so structurally ripped-through and so demanding of
examination and argument." What are the relevant terms of this argument
now, and how may they have changed in the decade since Andrews' previous
booklength work, _I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up (or, Social
Romanticism)_? How might a demolitional poetics of political critique
coexist with a reconstructive politics and erotics of poetic form in _Lip
Service_ as well as other works? In what ways has Andrews' project engaged
or sidestepped the pressing topicalities, micro- or macropolitical, of its
day, and to what extent have aspects of his work been absorbed, detourned,
rejected or reconfigured by younger poets?

Essays of varying lengths on these and related questions are sought for a
feature section of _Jacket_ magazine to be published in August of 2002.
Please send queries and submissions to the section editor, Nick Lawrence,
at nrl@acsu.buffalo.edu. Deadline: July 1st.

what's the URL of the sackner archive?
congrats David!

I am "reading" a book called A Humament which is a Victorian Novel Altered
by Tom Phillips, and it is dedicated to Marvin and Ruth Sackner...  it is a
really cool book.  The pages of the Victorian novel have been painted over,
revealing only a few words which tell quite a different (I imagine) and more
poetic "story."  Some pages are kind of like comic bok text with though
bibbles.  Other pages are representational art with few words. I am really
enjoying it.

This was first published in 1980.  I am interested to know whether this
technique was new then or not.  It resembles the cover of a book by Steve
McCaffery (or is it Lyn Heijinian?) on poetics which was new last summer...
Anyway this book was a book on poetics with several authors.

Millie

I'm posting below a revised version of the flyer for issue #10 of the
magazine.  I hope that listmembers don't mind the reposting; I'm doing it
because:

1) there's an important change: I've completely shifted the website over to
a new site, & have updated quite a few of the pages (notably the Prynne
bibliography & the N&Qs).  If you have a link to the site (esp. the Prynne
bibliography), please update your links.

2) the original flyer was posted at an unpropitious time of year (shortly
after Xmas) & I suspect that many listmembers had their subscriptions
suspended over the holidays.

all best --N

The Seattle Research Institute announces the publication of the first
volume in its Public Text Series:

"Politics without the State:  Joy, Terror and Depression in the Global
Corporate Order"

Edited by Diana George and Charles Tonderai Mudede

Including contributions by Nic Veroli, Diana George, Bess Lovejoy and
Robert Corbett

from the back:

Did anything change on September 11th, 2001? Did the global house
party--either of the neoliberal depredation or of anti-coporate
agitation--crash into the harsh pavement of downtown Manhattan?  Did we
witness the end of the world as we know it?  We submit that the answer is
"no."  The origin of some of some of the texts in this collection
testifies to this.  Written in the spring of 2001 as an investigation into
economic depression, these texts were already a meditation on fear.  In
looking at the world economic situation, we were determined to refuse the
trap of apocalyptic cliches. Instead, we wanted to exorcise fear with joy.
Even if in a different form, terror was what we wrote against from the
beginning.  This book is a bridge over the Lethe of terror:  economic
terror, fundamentalist terror and, most of all, ideological-military
terror.

Rachel Tzvia Back began her US reading tour in Tuscaloosa at the
University of Alabama.  She read from her new book of poems, Azimuth,
and from a series of new buffalo (the creature, not the place) poems.  A
remarkable, engaging reading.  For those of you in the path of her
readings -- 92nd Street Y (NYC), Barnard College, Cabrini College,
Wesleyan University -- I'd urge you to go.

We also celebrated the release of her critical book, Led by Language:
The Poetry and Poetics of Susan Howe, the latest book in the Modern and
Contemporary Poetics Series.  In the next few days, I'll post a discount
offer for Led by Language.

Someone has insulted your pet. You:

(a) Slime your way up to the top of the Postal hierarchy, and get your pet's
face put on a stamp, then lord it over the insulting party

(b) Have satisfying sex with your pet and laugh about the "insult" later

(c) Overfeed your pet and yourself and listen to a lot of talk radio

(d) Develop a "waste elimination system" for your pet which resembles a
commode for human use, then encourage your pet to eliminate waste with you
to develop a strong sense of solidarity, and once a solid "connection" has
been made, discuss the "insult" with your pet, answering all questions you

Conference, by Stacy Doris / $12.95

here is are the concluding words from Publisher Weekly's review of January
21, 2002

"Doris's modus operandi is one of constant reinvention, so that a daughter
'cradling her penis,' talking crows or putative transcripts from EgyptAir's
doomed flight 990 (the book was completed before September 11) are not
bizarre window-dressing on a conventional style, but a pathos-ridden
expression of trauma, a talking through the wound of harrowing engagement
with 20th-century life. Her secular mysticism, laced with a rich ironic
humor and propelled by a masterly, ludic semantics, is unlike anything else
in poetry today."

Subject:      Poet's Theater Jubilee
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Last Saturday,I flew to San Francisco from San Diego
to catch the last performances of the Poet's Theater
Jubilee. I took old friends from Berkeley with me,
folks who could remember the Bagel Shop in North Beach
and the poets who hung out there, some of whom were
the makers of the original Poet's Theater.

We had dinner at a wonderful Thai retuarant nearby and
marveled at how much our lives had changed though we
felt ourselves to be exactly the same. I felt rueful
at what we spent on dinner, until Tom reminded me that
"nothing is too good for the workers", in the words of
Marx. Ya mon.

The first performance of the evening was "Equivocal",
by Jena Osman. Jena, wherever you are, what a
wonderful piece! We loved it and I kept thinking of
the poor Wall Street Journal Reporter in Afghanistan
who seems to have forgotten there are some
neighborhoods you don't go to alone. You covered a lot
of ground. We larfed and larfed.
"Motion Picture Home" by Susan Gevirtz was next and
the language was wonderful.  I thought it might work
as well as a radio play.  The stage business seemed
superfluous to me, but what do I know?
"City Junket" was lovely. I  felt as though I was
priviledged to be at one of the performances of the
early Dadaists; maybe Breton and Tzara, having a
wonderful time. It was "fizzy as all get out".
Thanks to all who made it happen. You did a great job.

Laurie Macrae

Subject:      The Tango by Leslie Scalapino & artist Marina Adams
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

THE TANGO, published by Granary Books, $29.95; it is a poem by Scalapino =
with full-color photographs taken by her -- and a collaboration of =
painting on found material by artist Marina Adams.
    The photographs of monks in formal debate were taken by Scalapino at =
the Sera Monastery in Tibet. She adds this note about the project: "The =
text's internal debate is the author's comparison of HER mind phenomena =
to exterior phenomena, laying alongside each other actually -- such as =
the mind's comparison to dawn, to magnolias, to color of night, as if =
these are manifestations of mind phenomena, which they are HERE. Placing =
one's mind-actions beside magnolias (words). The same figure repeated =
everywhere, a line or passage may recur exactly as slipping out of, =
returning to, slipping out of, a frame of concentration and sound."
Artist Kiki Smith says about the book: THE TANGO is an investigation =
into the shifting locations of consciousness -- how our investment into =
the attributes of things determines what is evoked by them. Through the =
variable reconstructions of given forms (the fractured repetition of =
phrases and images) we encounter a multi-faceted possibility of =
awareness."
Robert Grenier wrote an introduction for the book. A sentence from it: =
Profound, beautiful, sorrowful, crooked/straight thinking WRIT -- beyond =
my own knowing (makes me feel Young and Old)"

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Re: <no subject>housepress is pleased to announce the release of :

INDEX
by Craig Dworkin.

ABOUT INDEX:
"I really do not know that anything has ever been more interesting than =
diagramming sentences," wrote Gertrude Stein, and when I came across the =
late 19th Century grammar book "How to Parse" -- the very book that =
Stein might well have used in school --  I of course began to parse it =
into its own system.  The title, for instance, translates as "Adverb =
preposition of the infinitive Transitive Active Voice Infinitive Mood =
Present Tense Verb."

The first part of this project, then, will present that translated text, =
and the second part of the project will be to take that parsed text as a =
template from which to write a new work that will be thematically quite =
different than the original grammar book (perhaps a novel?  a love =
story? a manifesto?), but will have the identical grammatical structure =
as the original textbook.

"My book might be called Philosophical Grammar.  This title would no =
doubt have the smell of a textbook title, but that doesn't matter, for =
behind it there is the book" (Ludwig Wittgenstein).  Or as Judith Butler =
puts it: "The anticipations of grammar are always and only retroactively =
installed."  Or, again, as Nietzsche wrote: "God is dead, but we still =
have grammar."

ABOUT CRAIG DWORKIN:
Craig Dworkin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English at =
Princeton University.  Recent essays have appeared in October, =
Sagetrieb, and the St. Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter, and his =
critical study of the politics of appropriation, "Reading the =
Illegible," is forthcoming this spring from Northwestern University =
Press.  A book of poetry is forthcoming from Atelos.

published in a limitde edition of 60 handbound and numbered copies.

$6.00 each

A great soul left us this last Sunday.  Dave Van Ronk,
who taught Bob Dylan and many others, who played the
music of and restored careers to long lost country
blues masters like Misssissipi John Hurt,who played
Brecht and Yates, and who gave shelter and support to
a generation of young folkies in the Village in the
late 50's and 60's is dead.
"He was a friend of mine" and everyone who ever heard
him play.

Probably my term "justified" is a bit cynical or sounds callous, I didnt
mean it so: and its hard to see any such violent act either perpetrated
agaonst the US or by any country: any such level of detruction or violence
as being "justified"...one is into the whole question of whether the ends
justify the means and eg Marxist rhetoic: rhetoric full stop which is
always a worry. Justified is the wrong term. maybe "explained" or
"analysed": certainly IF it was obvious that many more such attacks were
planned AND there rational was simply that Western democracy and
Christianity were "evil" AND the situation was as outlined by Bush, Blair
etal then there would be a case for stomping on the Al Qaeda hence
Afghanistan etc...But I remain skeptical of that analysis for now.

That's really sad news to me. When I was a teenage
folkie in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Dave Van
Ronk was one of my very favourite singers - I loved
"Come Back Baby" and his version of "Cocaine" (even
though I was yet to try the drug)
I have a CD with those great songs and still play it
occasionally when I'm in a late-60s mood.
Vale Dave Van Ronk.

Phillips began A Humument as an end of the day ritual to use of the paint
left on his palette

it soon became a celebrated project

yes there's a page taken rom on it the cover of McCaffery and Rasula's
highly recommended 'Imagining Language'

he has a lot of ongoing processual projects like this though none as
interesting to poets as 'A Humument' remains

Millie,
Actually pages from this book were used as cover images for two books
published within  a year of each other. McCaffery and Rasula's _Imagining
Language_ and Joris and Rothenberg's _Poems for the Millenium V.II_.

Another wierd confluence is the two books published last year called
_Telling it Slant_. One by Coach House from Toronto and the other in the
US that has been mentioned on this list.

So there you go.

Dear List Members:

This was an interview that was supposed to be up last month - Michael and
I had started on it in early September, and then came September 11 which
of course altered both the time the interview was supposed to be "on line"
and the overall tenor of the questions and answers.

reading "Song of the Round Man"), go to

        Hi Everyone! I was gone for a bit due to an ice storm in Buffalo
and then a lazt internet service provider. Its so odd to watch the Cable
guy vclimb to towering pole to hook me back up to the virtual. It seems
so real now -- a real system that is afraid of ice storms and wind. I've
missed you all. Its very interesting to read all this mail in one large
format.

        And a special shout out to Kent Johnson!! Woo Hoo! Thanks for
the kind epigram !

        Best and happy to be home again.

Although I do remember that Dylan did credit Dave Van Ronk with his version
of "He was a Friend of Mine" -- it was John Fahey who was responsible for the
return of Mississippi John Hurt, who rediscovered  him in Avalon,
Mississippi, after listening to a John Hurt song "Avalon is My Home Town."
This is not to diminish Van Ronk, who had a rich and varied career.

hello,

if there are any canadians on this list who are organizing regular
readings could they please contact me? I'm compiling a national
directory/calender with the aim of convincing the large wigs in toronto
that there should be a national poetry segment on the CBC.

The pilot has been approved now I just need as much evidence of activity
as possible.

the large KSW contingent in NYC hasn't been overlooked.

backchannel of course.

thanks,
kevin

for a Caribbean subsidiary of a joint venture created with money from an
investment partnership that was partially owned by an internal offshore hedge
fund that originally acted as a shell corporation for a second investment
partnership spun off from three separate private partnerships created with
stock and options from the first partnership which enabled the fourth

        Floating Sushi  An original game of letters and words that takes you on a non-linear stroll
through the street poetry of San Francisco's distinctive typefaces, color
palette and consumer needs. Rather than imitate the idea of a "game," this
is actually something you could get good at.     flash make it so       The Impermanence Agent  I haven't actually gotten this to run, but the concept is great: a running
narrative created by the texts that appear on the pages you are browsing,
illustrated by collages constructed from those same pages. Mac only folks.
 make it so     The Pornolizer  Not sure if this is for the "wish I'd thought of that" category, but this
site -- which exposes a Sadean sublife of cataclysmic, if unsatisfying,
sexual exchange beneath any text -- seems the natural use for word
replacement algorithms.                 Series Poems  I have some misgivings about Jason Nelson's aesthetic sense, but there's
something to be said for a rotating poetry device that emits secondary text
clusters based on the user's clicks and rollovers. Nelson is a prolific web
poet whose other work appears here.             text.ure.org/  This site "inspired by the textural white on white paintings of Kasimir
Malevich" is a highly intricate, beautiful application that allows you to
contribute to a language structure that can be recombined by later users and
also viewed in different diagrammatic fashions.                 The Gates of Paradise  David Daniels is kind of like a Blake with a word processor, or an
Apollinaire with a mystical bent creating caligrammes as fast as the laser
printer will allow -- or neither, but an original, if strange, artist whose
primary fan base seems to be on the web.

is Flash-heavy in its navigation, but slower computers can use the html nav
or go directly to the .pdfs.            Duration Press  The Duration Press houses more .pdf poetry files than any site that I know
of, including writers as diverse as Jacques Roubaud, Clark Coolidge, Juliana
Spahr, Xue Di - oh, they're unpredictable. They have an international
chapbook series, an archive, and a series of e-books dedicated to younger

Subject:      Essays Wanted for a Companion to 20C American Poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

I am editing A Companion to Twentieth-Century American Poetry (for Facts on
File, Inc., a publisher that enjoys very wide distribution in libraries,
colleges and high schools, as well as bookstores). The project has been
ongoing for about a year, and the volume is scheduled to appear in 2004.
Some essay topics that had been assigned to people now have to be reassigned
(writers who thought they'd be able to contribute essays have found they
cannot do so after all), and so I am soliciting essayists to contribute to
the volume.

The volume will be peer reviewed. Payment for essays will be in
presentational offprints and, too, for the large topic essays, a copy of the
book. All essays will carry the author's name, and a list of contributors
will appear in the back of the book.

The list of entries for the volume can be viewed at this website:
http://eies.njit.edu/~kimmelma/companion.html; also at the website can be
found a set of guidelines for writing the essays as well as sample, model
essays.

If you are interested in writing for this book, then please contact me via
e-mail (see my eddress below), using the subject header Essays for Book (or
else simply reply to this message). If I don't know you, then please provide
me with a bit of background about yourself including a brief account of your
publishing history if you have one.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Cordially,

Burt

Millie, I think as far as visual poetry and recuts go,
A Humument is landmark work and a definite masterpiece. It's interesting to note that Phillips keeps reworking the book, so that there are at least 30  reworked pages (different text and/or artwork) in each new edition (the latest is the 4th, i believe). When I visited Sackners 2 years ago, Marvin told me that they are either in possession, or aware of over 800 distinct pages. Also, success of the Phillips' work brought the original Victorian novel, A Human Document, back to print in the U.K.

As for the cutup technique, William Burroughs and Brion Gysin developed it in the 50s, combining it with collaging methods used by DADA and early surrealists. However, what makes A Humument such an achievement is Phillips's awareness of the different literary & art styles, as well as his ability to fuse them together. Tom Phillips just might be the third British most impressive poly-artist, after William Bake and Wyndham Lewis.

Best,
Igor Satanovsky

MARCH 3, SUNDAY
A MEMORIAL TRIBUTE TO FIELDING DAWSON (1930-2002)
On the afternoon of Sunday, March 3rd, the Poetry Project will hold a
Memorial Tribute to the writer, teacher and poet, Fielding Dawson, who
passed away on January 5th, 2002, will take place at The Poetry Project from
3 to 7 pm.

Fielding Dawson is the author of over 20 books, including a recent
collection of short stories, The Land of Milk and Honey. A student at Black
Mountain College from 1949-53, he wrote extensively and wonderfully on that
experience in The Black Mountain Book. He served as director and dedicated
teacher of the PEN Prison Writing Workshop Program. On Thurdsay mornings he
was on WAKE UP CALL, hosted by Bernard White on radio station WBAI (99.5 FM
in New York), with Breaking Down the Walls. Every spring he was
Writer-in-Residence at Hartwick, NY where he worked with at-risk youth in
Upward Bound. In 1999 he received the Thomas Mott Osborne Service Award from
The Osborne Association Family Works. Often gracing The Poetry Project with
his presence, both as a reader of his work and as a listener passionately
committed to writing, he generated excitement and insight wherever he was.
We find it hard to imagine we will not see him again, at a reading,
standing, rapt with attention and his love for words. He will be deeply
missed.



--
Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $7, $4 for students and
seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members. Schedule is subject to change.

Subject:      DWORKIN' BJORK
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Spork: Blend of sp(ank + Bj)ork. A proprietary name for a piece of spankery
shaped to cup former Sugar Cube, Björk Gudmundsdottir's buttock. (At the age
of fifteen, Bjork formed the group Tappi Tikarass, a post-punk outfit
influenced strongly by Siouxsie and the Banshees. "Tappi Tikarass" is
Icelandic for "Tap her cute [lit. "tiki-time"] buttock").

Patent Information: 1993 Official Gaz. (U.S. Patent Office) 11 Aug. tm 65
Vaughn Bode Milling Co., Inc., Clinton, MO. Spork for spanking Iceland's
most famous singer.

A spork is a perfect metaphor for human existence. It suggests that anyone
"has access to" Bjork's ass. It makes one painfully, depressingly aware just
how far from Bjork's ass any one of us actually are: it shows us how we each
have failed miserably at our lives. You cannot use the spork to do the one
thing the spork is intended to be used for: to spank Bjork.

Uses for the spork?

Invert the spork (place it curve side down on a table) and call it a foon
(fo'on = foison).


Sporks from around the world:

fodient - of or relating to digging
foehn - dry wind that blows down from mountaintops
foeticide - one fetus killing another fetus (?)

    foliform - shaped like a leaf
    fontinal - growing near springs
    footle - to waste time; to act foolishly

Spork, oh how I adore thee,

           beautiful piece of art.

                I sit alone in my bed,

                         no thoughts in my head,

            except for those of my spork.


BOY WITH THE SPORK IN HIS HAND: Satan, how come there is so much suffering
in the world?

SATAN: God hates humans. He wants you all to suffer.

BOY WITH THE SPORK IN HIS HAND: Thanks, Satan!


                 There was once an old woman,

                             she died a happy woman,

                              her spork in her hand.


DWORKIN' BJORK: Mind and thought have their origin in an abstract plane of
conscious intelligence, which comes into manifest form through the symbols
of language. The brain is not the source of the mind, but merely the
physical instrument of the mind. When name is attached to an individual,
certain specific forces of conscious intelligence are combined. They
constitute the nucleus of the mind. The conscious forces combined by the
name can be represented by a numerical formula in much the same way as the
basic chemical elements combined in a chemical compound can be represented
by a chemical formula. The mental characteristics of an individual can be
read from the numerical formula representing the person's name, just as the
characteristics of a chemical compound can be read from its chemical
formula.

Millie -- A Humument has been one of my favorites for ages -- so much so
that I used pages from it twice for covers: 1) on MATIERES D'ANGLETERRE, the
first anthology of english avant-garde poetry, edited together with Paul
Back in the early 80s & published only in France and 2) the cover of voluem
2 of POEMS OF THE MILLENNIUM.

I do like some of his other big projects too: his INFERNO is superb. He is
also a composer & I do enjoy his SIX OF HEARTS (CD) with soprano Mary
Wiegold.

The obliterated text was not new then: da levy did the the same kind of
thing
in the sixties.  Probably the dadaists invented it.  Doris Cross painted
over texts
about the same time Phillips did.  I've never researched it and would be
most
interested in who first used the technique, and who first used it to real
poetic
effect.  Phillips does seem to have done it better than anyone else.  He's
the
one important visual poet in English acknowledged to be such by Marjorie
Perloff and Johanna Drucker.

I too was saddened to hear this. After listening to his
music on record for years, I finally had the chance to see
him perform when he came through town just a few months
ago. So I can report that, to the end, he was funny, warm,
and still a dazzling singer and guitarist. He had a kind of
Elmer Fudd lisp that was very endearing -- impressed me
as the kind of person who doesn't give a damn for
celebrity.

Some of you may know that he learned one of his signature
tunes, "Green Green Rocky Road," from Bob Kaufman, the S.F.
Beat legend. I believe it was a children's song Kaufman
remembered from his early years in New Orleans.

you open your arms wide, begging the populace to embrace you. you pull
your arms around your body. pop-pop-pop. it hums with the beauty of death.
it warms to my hand. i am once again, warm in my hand, warm with the
beauty of it. no pop-pop-pop, we emerged later with blood on our arms. at
last i came to the eastern arm to hold my warm out, my flesh out, to their
touch, their gatherings, communal. it seems impossible. i want to hold my
warm out, my flesh out, i'm feverish; there are strange welts on my arms..

[Some goofy thing I'm involved in...]

February 18
8:00 pm

The Poetry Project's President's Day 24-Hour Play Festival

Plays by:
Jeffery McDaniel, Rachel Levitsky, Brian Kim Stefans, Sharon Mesmer, Jordan
Davis
 The process begins at 10 pm the night before the show, when a group of about
fifty writers, directors, actors and designers gather at a theater for the
latest round of the unpredictable. After everyone has been briefed (and
Polaroided), the writers are left alone to each compose a ten-minute play.
At 7 am, the directors return, read the plays, make their bids for a play,
and begin casting. The actors arrive at 8 am, meet with their respective
writer/director teams; rehearsals start promptly at 9 am. Tech rehearsal
runs from 5 to 7:30 pm-doors open at 7:45. At 8 pm, ink barely dry, the new
plays are performed for a live audience. Since its inception in 1995, The
24-Hour Plays have produced well over 200 new short plays in this manner.
This is the first time the event has taken place at the Poetry Project.
 Admission: $9 general, $6 students & seniors, $5 members

To Geoffery and Other Listers. Welcome back. I spent years doing cable work,
pole work, telephone intsallations and cable faults and so on ...also worked
on microwave antennae: never in an icy blizzard but sometimes in the mud and
rain: but you get to keep fit and those were good days when my family were
young. Once my daughter said: "What do poles do Dad?"  I dont dare embarass
her with that question nowadays: nor do i dare argue my crazy political
ideas!
 In touch with "the real" I was, whatever "the real" is.  Lets all write
poetry and debate things: make (inrelligent?) noises not war. Richard

Daniel etal. I enjoy your interviews.. Michael Palmer is clearly a very
intelligent writer and thinker: his oint that the way one's perception of
poems is altered (by events, "exreme events") is interesting. I was looking
at some (mostly bad and bit mushy) pems I'd been wriitng about 2 or so days
before when I had decided to turn my back on ANY new input as kiind of
"experiment": that is I was  going to know nothing about any news and see
how that affected thhings (a crazy idea robably) but then I was shocked
awake with my son ringing about "America's under attack!!"   It was
bizzarre, extraordinary and even at this distance shocking. Even with no
remotely personal danger to myself or family...I actually went thru a big
range of emotions and I'm not even American. At one stage I began to get
paranoid and I was walking around my house witha knife! Dont worry, I
probably could never kill anyone or fight my way out of a paper bag...but
the poems I tried to write "about S11" simply dont work. (They sometimes
just seem clever... (I mean bad-clever))  Its bizarre...but looking back at
those (previous to S11) poems they are strange now. Seem nearly pointless.
I have read poetry of Brecht and I aso heard an interview on the radio with
Wolye Soyinka: now a man with his life and experience couldn't not but be
(strongly overtly)  "political"...but for all that the implication is there:
a very intense lyric by Creeley, or a collablorative poem by Ashbery, or the
amazing Jess-Duncan art, even difficulty (or especially difficulty) or
simplicity: something obscure...they all have their place so to speak.
   It was a good idea for those poets to have a reading as it also restores
one's belief in one's own work or the need to work or dabble as the case
maybe  in poetry or lit. Its against war or terror but also the "twisting"
and hijacking of language...altho of course poets are the "worst" twisters
of the lot! Those interviews are very good, thanks for the link.Regards,
Richard.

Subject:      Discount offer - Rachel Back's new Susan Howe book
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Led by Language
The Poetry and Poetics of Susan Howe

Rachel Tzvia Back

This first full-length study of Susan Howe illuminates the historical,
autobiographical, and theoretical influences that underlie the work of
this enigmatic and important contemporary American poet.

In Led by Language, poet and scholar Rachel Tzvia Back offers a close
and detailed reading of Susan Howe's provocative and powerful poetry.
Howe's work is dense, often difficult, but always distinctive, and
Back's volume explains a number of features crucial to understanding her
poems.
        In this complete survey of Howe's major work, from 1978's Secret
History of the Dividing Line to 1999's Pierce-Arrow, Back highlights the
key strategies underlying Howe's work: linguistic experimentation,
historical motifs, autobiographical references, and visual
experimentation with types, fonts, and images. One of the book's most
compelling arguments is Back's case for reading Howe's work
autobiographically. An obsession with history characterizes Howe's
poetry-historical figures from Mary Magdalene to Melville haunt her
work-and Back deftly demonstrates the intensely personal nature of much
of the historical terrain Howe traverses.
        This study debunks the myth of Howe's impenetrability, making her work
accessible to a wide range of readers. Back has created a thorough guide
to reading and understanding this important poet, and her book will be
welcomed by students and scholars of contemporary poetry, American
literature, literary theory, and cultural studies.


"This book will be an essential resource. . . . (There is) a marvelously
restless, inquiring, lucid intelligence at work. . . . (It is)
delightful, engaging reading . . . scholarship at its finest."
                -Hank Lazer

"The first full-length study of Susan Howe's poetry . . . will be of
enormous value to students of Howe's work as well as to anyone
interested in contemporary experimental poetry and poetics."
                -Marjorie Perloff

Rachel Tzvia Back is an Assistant Professor of English at Tel-Aviv
University in Israel and the author of Azimuth, a collection of poetry.

Hi Joel and Richard.  Well, call me crazy but I don't think deliberate
attacks on civilians, i.e., with no military target in sight, can ever be
justified.  I agree that prejudice against the Arab population has been
"reinforced."  But the key here is in the word.  Most Americans, like most
people everyone, are a pretty bigoted bunch.  Even Bush's two appearances on
TV during which he warned US citizens to knock off the bigotry while praising
most Muslims, can't help much.  Believe me, I am no fan of Bush, or of
politicians generally.  But Bush did publicly defend Muslims and condemn the
bigots, for what it's worth.  Whatever sneaky shit goes on behind the
curtain, what the West heard from Bush is a vote of confidence for Muslims,
for Islam.  So I'll give him that much.

As Richard says, if the information we are fed is accurate, then the US is
justified in its actions.  We really can't know if military actions against
Afghanistan have made our side of the fence safer.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps so.
 It is clear that certain arrests in this country have averted planned
attacks.  That's something, anyway.  It is also clear that a large percentage
of the Afghan population (who can say how large?) is delighted to see the
Taliban gone.  Both men and women there, denied the opportunity to practice
their professions, can now do so.

No disagreement from me on the corrupt machinations of the US government.
But sympathizing with another government, equally or more corrupt, seems
illogical to me.  How does that make the world safer?  How does pissing off
the toughest guy on the block make the world safer?  Obviously, it doesn't.
Logic.  Europe is even more dependent on Middle East oil than the US is, so
it's not surprising that they would drag their feet when oil rich nations are
targeted.  The French also have serious business dealings with North Korea.
Nothing here surprises.  You and I know what so many people are like, how the
world works.  If, however, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are in fact
harboring/funding those who work for the annihilation of the west, then I
certainly understand that the best defense is a good offense.  But am I ready
to take everything the White House puts out as gospel?  Never have.  Can I
say definitively that they are lying?  Nope.  Yes, we know they have lied
about lots of things.  But so has everyone else.

That most Arabs have condemned the attack -- well, we really have no way of
knowing this.  In this country most Arabs seem to support the attacks.  Right
wing Arab radio broadcasts anti-west propaganda in the Middle East (in the
West, we get the reverse).  A steady diet of that might convince that all
Arab nations are poised to rise up against the West.  But the protests there
have been steadily losing steam, similar to the protests here, according to
most news sources.  We really have no footing from which to judge what is
true and what isn't.  I would have to be there, to talk to the people, to
observe just how heavy or light was the collateral damage caused by American
bombs, before I felt I could speak with authority.  It does seem that the
damage was rather light considering the number of bombs in the air, which may
be a tribute to American technological brilliance, if not a moral
justification.  Or it may be so that not since W.W.II has the US military
deliberately targeted civilians.  But again, I have no way of knowing for
certain.  I can only watch the screen, read the papers, read the journals
right and left, correspond with friends in Europe and China, and stare at the
patchwork quilt.  Every one of my Jewish friends, both in an out of the
avant-garde community, believes that the anti-Israel rhetoric is driven by
anti-Semitism, conscious or unconscious.  Perhaps they're right.  Perhaps
not.  I realize that so much equivocation can be infuriating.  But I'm a
practical man.  I'm not jumping until I know there's water in the pool.

My sense of most New Yorkers is that they were frightened for a short while,
but that is long over.  Now they're just pissed.  And they want their
government to make sure such a tragedy never happens again.  Most are aware
that during such times, civil liberties always take a hit as the government
puts up protective fences.  Some view this latest hit as substantial.  Others
see it as rather light, and that view seems the more common throughout the
US.  As always, perception is reality.  As for my position, I've learned that
my views rarely coincide with anyone's, point for point.

The litany of US sins, of course, no longer shocks, not since the Nam.  But
can we not see them as a red herring?  That the US has committed atrocities
does not alter the fact that other nations have been equally corrupt and
inhumane -- in many cases moreso -- and to the best of their ability.  I'm
sure you don't really believe that the governments/political organizations
the US targeted had clean hands?  Wouldn't that be naive?

I don't consider my previous remarks a counter attack.  Nothing personal
intended, though I did question a point of view.  Joel wondered why the
Vietnam generation is not out in force, and I thought I'd offer a possible
reason or two.  I don't think it's any great loss, anyway.  My generation
raised some light, but also dropped some darkness.  A younger generation is
perfectly capable of doing the same.  My experience has taught me that no
matter which camp cooks your meal, there's a little arsenic in every bite.
Your experience may lead somewhere else entirely.  Whatever, I appreciate the
give and take, always.  And naturally I respect anyone's right to position
him/her self.  Best wishes to both of you.  Bill

AMERICAN YOGI: PERSPECTIVES ON EASTERN PRACTICE AND OUR NATIONAL MYTHOLOGY

A panel discussion following the Thursday, February 28th performance of
The Yoga of Moby Dick
with moderator Barbara Lane, Mark Kenward, Hilton Obenzinger and other
distinguished scholars.

The Marsh
1062 Valencia
near 22nd

Many Western scholars and writers have predicted that the meeting of Eastern
and Western philosophies will someday prove to be one of the most=
 significant
events of our age. Today in America=E2=80=94when consumerism has never been=
 more
rampant and danger has never seemed so near=E2=80=94 more people than ever=
 are
grounding their lives in Eastern practices such as Yoga, Zen, and=
 meditation.
Some of these seekers leave their homeland, figuratively and literally,=
 while
others remain here in America trying to tread an authentic path within their
own cultural milieu. Can it be done? Can our own literature, mythology, and
memoirs help us relate to the Eastern philosophy of self-transcendence? Or
are we courting spiritual dilettantism by refusing to let go of the=
 trappings
of our narcissistic culture? These questions and more will be addressed in
two fascinating panel discussions. Please join Mark and friends for one of
these lively forays into a world of literature, memoir, and enlightenment.

THE YOGA OF MOBY-DICK

WHAT IT'S ABOUT:

     God or no God?  If a whale ate your leg could you still do tree pose?
Mark Kenward asks the essential questions in his provocative comic solo
performance which won effusive praise in its initial outings at The Winnipeg
and San Francisco Fringe Festivals and was awarded a mainstage run at San
Francisco=E2=80=99s most prestigious venue for solo performance: The Marsh.

     Developed with and directed by SF solo performance guru David Ford, The
Yoga of Moby-Dick is the fourth in a quartet of innovative works that
originated with Kenward=E2=80=99s stunning one man adaptation of Moby-Dick.=
 This
recreation of Melville's classic text was nominated by the Bay Area Theater
Critics Association for best solo performance in 1995 and toured eleven
cities, drawing praise in each one.

     Now, as a new dad and nascent Yoga teacher, Kenward once again wrestles
with Melville's ideas but in a contemporary context that has electrified
audiences. With the fervor of a mad Ahab, Kenward pursues an improbable and
surprisingly personal connection between Hatha Yoga and the great American
novel as he struggles with the legacy of a literate yet violent parent.
During the course of the show, he restlessly prowls a vast landscape from
Nantucket to the Mill Valley Yoga Studio to the deck of the Pequod in search
of meditative redemption that may be no further than his own back yard.

     Kenward allows this tale to unfold in his inimitably, self-effacing,
comic manner while bravely welcoming us into the darkest parts of a
mysterious past that still haunts him today.

     Please also note the two special events we're including with this show.
There's info about both the Scholars Panel (called: American Yogi) and the
yoga classes.


FROM THE CRITICS:

=E2=80=9CIn this powerful solo performance he will make you laugh hard,=
 think hard,
feel hard, and at the same time he will achieve a total participation from
the audience. It is highly recommended!=E2=80=9D
     - SF Tribune

=E2=80=9CMark Kenward has a whale of a tale in THE YOGA OF MOBY-DICK, a=
 sharp,
well-deconstructed meditation on the parallels between Herman Melville=E2=80=
=99s=20
epic
novel, yoga, and Kenward=E2=80=99s own life and quest for enlightenment.=E2=
=80=9D
     - Winnipeg Sun

=E2=80=9CThe subtle way in which he allows the verse and chapter of his=
 literary
scripture to inform us about the whirling sea of his personal life is
wonderful to observe. Yoga may be about non-attachment, but it would be easy
to be un-yogmatic about this imaginative and entertaining play. You can get
attached to it.=E2=80=9D
     - CBC Radio Winnipeg

=E2=80=9C(A) strange merger of a book report, yoga class, theological=
 discussion, and
personal journey that takes you through the gamut of emotions. Often
hilarious, Mr. Kenward gives a stellar performance. You may be laughing one
breath, and deadly silent the next I highly recommend THE YOGA OF=
 MOBYDICK.=E2=80=9D
     - UMFM Radio=E2=80=B9Winnipeg

=E2=80=9C(A)s details of his own life creep into the narrative and wrap=
 themselves
around this classic whaling tale, we suddenly find ourselves squeezed into
the vortex of Kenward=E2=80=99s own spiritual journey, a journey into an=
 underworld
populated by truly American characters I heartily recommend it.=E2=80=9D
     - Sanfranciscoguide@about.com

=E2=80=9CLanky and handsome, he weaves these disparate elements into a=
 fascinating
comic monologue Kenward has real stage presence: Imagine Bruce Dern crossed
with Woody Harrelson.=E2=80=9D

For those of you who are curious about such things, since the Factory School
poetry audio archive reopened in January, we have received requests (hits)
more than 2500 files. While it is difficult to know how many total unique
individuals have visited the site to listen to poetry, since the breakdown
for the stats is by month (and I have no way to know if a unique visitor in
January has returned), I can say that in January alone more than 260 unique
sites (individuals) were responsible for the more than 2000 file requests.
For February, so far more than 160 unique visitors have asked for about 500
files. Granted, none of this is scientific, and my own site adminisrator
duties probably account for about twenty to thirty hits alone. For some
reason, no one -- anywhere in the world -- has requested a file in either
month in the 11-12am hour Mountain Time (where the server is located). Here
is a list of the most popular requests:

Ohara (54)
Ginsberg/howl (35)
Frost/mendingwall (32)
Baraka/rhythm blues (28)
Whitman/america (28)
Whitman/songofmyself (27)
Bishop/fillingstation   (26)
Angelou/sepia fashion show (25)
Stevens/soliloquy       (24)
Ginsberg/supermarket (21)
Auden/nyc64(20)

Frost/road not taken (18)
Lowell (18)
Auden/wanderer (17)
Baraka/freedom suite (17)

Zukofsky/"A"mix (15)
Berrigan/part1  (13)

Zukofsky/kpfa 13
Auden/musee (12)
Browning (12)
Pound/canto-i (11)
Pound/canto-iv (11)
Pound/canto-xxxvi (10)

Now, in my opinion this is very interesting. Check out the list and see if
you can't do something about these numbers:  http://www.factoryschool.org

Those of you who have so graciously donated audio to the project will be
receving your free CDs this week. If you would like to send tapes in
exchange for copies of the Factory School audio archive, drop me a note:

JIM CARROLL

The Basketball Diaries, first published in 1978, was adapted into a movie
starring Leonardo DiCaprio in 1995.  Carroll's diary was lauded by Jack
Kerouac, who observed, "At 13 years of age, Jim Carroll writes better prose
than 89% of the novelists working today." As Viking Penguin's best-selling
poet, Jim Carroll has written over 7 books of poetry, including the
award-winning Living at the Movies, the critically lauded Praying Mantis
spoken word album, Forced Entries, The Book of Nods, Fear of Dreaming, and
most recently Void Of Course, featuring the popular "8 Fragments for Kurt
Cobain."  As Newsweek noted, the song "People Who Died" from his "Catholic
Boy" album, in effect "propelled Carroll from underground status...to
national attention as a contender for the title of rock's new poet laureate."


ANNE WALDMAN

Anne Waldman, a performance poet and teacher, joined forces with Allen
Ginsberg in 1974 to found the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at
the Naropa Institute.  She has written more than 43 books, including the
book-length epic poems Iovis I and II: All is Full of Jove, as well as Fast
Speaking Woman.  Her most recent books include Vow to Poetry: Essays,
Interviews, Manifestos, and Marriage: A Sentence, a volume of poems published
by Penguin in 2001. The New York Times calls Anne Waldman "the fastest,
wisest woman to run with the wolves in some time."

As Bush's war for global domination looks set to move
onto a massive new stage - and to prompt massive new
opposition, in the First as well as the Third World -
the job of opposing the Pentagon's propaganda wing
becomes more and more important.

BLACK HAWK DOWN:
HOLLYWOOD AND THE PENTAGON REWRITE HISTORY

What really happened in Somalia and why?

On December 12, 1992, the US sent 28,000 soldiers into
Somalia under the auspices of the United Nations in a
supposed "humanitarian operation" to bring food to
starving people. TV photo opportunities included a
staged D-Day style landing on the beach, to waiting
cameras, and copious news coverage of hungry Somalians
receiving food courtesy of the "international
community." What we didn't see was the other major
activity of the US forces of "Operation Restore Hope":
the almost daily gun battles in heavily populated
neighbourhoods which resulted in the deaths of over
10,000 Somalis in only ten months. Resistance to the
US presence in Somalia, which rapidly became
widespread, was brutally repressed.

Journalist Richard Dowden, not to be confused with
Mark Bowden, on whose book the film is based,
discovered that the US army started killing Somali
civilians right from the outset of its mission. "In
one incident, Rangers took a family hostage. When one
of the women started screaming at the Americans, she
was shot dead. In another incident, a Somali prisoner
was allegedly shot dead when he refused to stop
praying outside. Another was clubbed into silence."
The human rights group Africa Watch stated that the
United Nations' troops "have engaged in abuses of
human rights, including killing of civilians, physical
abuse, theft…" The abuses included turning machine
guns on unarmed protesters and the firing of missiles
into residential areas. The report concluded that
"UNOSOM has become an army of occupation."

Why did the US intervene in Somalia?

By 1991, the pro-US President Siad Barre had leased
nearly two thirds of Somalia to four US oil companies.
When he was overthrown, the US needed another way of
guaranteeing their interests. Initially they chose a
local leader, Mohammed Farrah Aideed, but when he
proved unreliable, they intervened directly. And when
the US intervenes, it means business. A few days
before the troops hit the beach, the US embassy set up
shop in oil company Conoco's corporate compound. At
the same time, Colin Powell, then chairing the US
military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the
invasion as a "paid political advertisement" for the
Pentagon. Powell opposed calls to spend more money on
the pressing needs of health, housing and education,
taking the opportunity to argue instead for continued
military spending. Now, as this movie whitewashes the
role of the US military in Somalia, Colin Powell,
George W Bush and the US army are casting about for
new countries to invade as they continue their "War on
Terrorism." Somalia is again high on the list. What
better way to prepare people for this new aggression
than a movie that, in the words of New York Times
critic Elvis Mitchell, "converts the Somalis into a
pack of snarling dark-skinned beasts..."

How does New Zealand fit in?

Here in New Zealand, the government was quick to
commit SAS soldiers and other military resources to
the "War on Terrorism." Who knows whether they will be
deployed to kill Somalians this year, just as they
were sent to kill the Afghan people last year? There
was money immediately available to beef up the SIS and
send troops to far flung corners of the globe, but if
we want our kids to get a good education or an
operation at hospital, or if nurses want a pay rise,
we're told the coffers are empty. There's something
wrong when it's easier to get extra funding to join an
international bombing attack on the world's poorest
and most defenceless countries than it is to fund a
hospital.

"The first casualty of war is truth"

The US military cooperated intimately in the making of
this film, supplying staff, expertise and equipment to
make the action look as realistic as possible. But
that's not the same as "showing what really happened".
Before the film was released, the Motion Picture
Association of America held a private screening for
senior White House advisers, allowing them to make
changes to the movie. What chance was there that they
would allow the depiction of helicopter gunships
firing indiscriminately at people in the streets and
markets of Mogadishu? What chance was there that they
would allow US soldiers to be depicted, as most
interviewed by Mark Bowden described, firing "on
crowds and eventually at anyone and anything they
saw"?

But at least while we watch the film, we can admire
the personal courage and morality of the individual
soldiers involved, right? Well, unfortunately no. It's
no surprise that they gave a new name to Ewan
McGregor's character, Company Clerk John Grimes for
the film. The real John Grimes, John "Stebby"
Stebbins, is now serving a 30-year sentence in Fort
Leavenworth military prison for raping a 12-year-old
girl.

If you're looking for a true story, you're as likely
to find it in Lord of the Rings as in Black Hawk Down.
We hope you enjoy the film, but remember to treat it
as you might any other action fantasy. Also bear in
mind that the "heroes" of Delta Force are actually the
soldiers of an invading army, and the forces of the
"evil Somali warlords" are actually defending
themselves and their country from an entirely
unprovoked attack. And in Somalia today, people are
bracing themselves for Black Hawk Down 2, only that
will be real, and New Zealand should have no part in
it.

to list on Louis: -- 1. The first step is to send a letter stating that you
wish to file your titles in Louis. The letter should include: name, address,
phone number, fax number, e-mail address and contact person. It is important
to remember that you must be willing to exchange, sell, or lend. 2. Upon
receipt of your contact information, we will send you Louis forms for filing
Intentions and Completions. Use Intention forms when you begin transcribing
or recording. 3. For each title, send photocopies of the front and back of
the title page, along with a completed Intention form. This step is
extremely important to accurately list your title in Louis. 4. When the item
is completed, send in a Completion form. If the item is already completed,
and no Intention form or photocopies were previously submitted, send the
title page photocopies along with the Completion form. The goal of the
training is to help users learn to retrieve information that is useful and

time of travel to the object and back, and frequency-shift of the pulse. The
frequency of the returning signal typically changes based upon the motion of
the raindrops (snowflake, dust, etc.). You have most likely experienced the
“Doppler effect” around trains. First Execution of 2002: James Johnson was
convicted of killing 4 people in a single night; including two sheriffs and
a deputy. On January 9 he was executed at the state prison in Potosi. Jeri
Johnson, wife of the accused, believes that her husband was suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder while committing the acts of violence.
Johnson was a Vietnam Veteran and went on numerous night infantry patrols.
However, all of this information was deemed inadmissible during his trial.
Protests were held all over the state on the evening of his execution.

in baseball that can create the excitement of “pitchers and catchers

i'm jennifer and i know everything. there are bars of pink-red flesh. you
can't go in there. there are shadows as well. the shadows are cool; they
cover the holes. they show you just how dimensional the bars are. the bars
are way in front of the holes. the bars stop the holes from sinking. the
bars stop you from sinking into the holes. the bars hash everything that
goes through them. that is everything gets two variables which access like
indirect addressing. you can't go in straight ahead. you have to go in
with a twenty-eight degree angle. you can fit in with a twenty-degree
angle. you can go in either hole but one of them is more difficult and you
must go in through the bars and change from one to another. everything is
tiny tiny and you can dream with them.  you can only see them and the
scent of them. the scent of them is jennifer and this is all you know of
jennifer and nothing else and jennifer knows everything. jenny sleeps in
niky. you can see niky too.

For those of you who are curious about such things, since the Factory
School poetry audio archive reopened in January, we have received
requests (hits) more than 2500 files. While it is difficult to know how
many total unique individuals have visited the site to listen to poetry,
since the breakdown for the stats is by month (and I have no way to know
if a unique visitor in January has returned), I can say that in January
alone more than 260 unique sites (individuals) were responsible for the
more than 2000 file requests. For February, so far more than 160 unique
visitors have asked for about 500 files. Granted, none of this is
scientific, and my own site adminisrator duties probably account for
about twenty to thirty hits alone. For some reason, no one -- anywhere
in the world -- has requested a file in either month in the 11-12am hour
Mountain Time (where the server is located). Here is a list of the most
popular requests:

Ohara (54)
Ginsberg/howl (35)
Frost/mendingwall (32)
Baraka/rhythm blues (28)
Whitman/america (28)
Whitman/songofmyself (27)
Bishop/fillingstation   (26)
Angelou/sepia fashion show (25)
Stevens/soliloquy       (24)
Ginsberg/supermarket (21)
Auden/nyc64(20)
Eliot(20)
Frost/road not taken (18)
Lowell (18)
Auden/wanderer (17)
Baraka/freedom suite (17)
Mayakovsky (16)
Zukofsky/"A"mix (15)
Berrigan/part1  (13)
Niedecker (13)
Pound/canto-xlv (13)
Wilde (13)
Zukofsky/kpfa 13
Auden/musee (12)
Browning (12)
Pound/canto-i (11)
Pound/canto-iv (11)
Pound/canto-xxxvi (10)

Now, in my opinion this is very interesting. Check out the list and see
if you can't do something about these numbers:
http://www.factoryschool.org

Those of you who have so graciously donated audio to the project will be
receving your free CDs this week. If you would like to send tapes in
exchange for copies of the Factory School audio archive, drop me a note:

I didn't know that, so thanks, Laurie -- also it wasn't Van Ronk who was the
source of Dylan's "He Was a Fiend of Mine" as I reported earlier, but Rick
Von Schmidt, another of the troubadours of the 50's and 60's....

Howdy folks, just wanted to say that there's a review of my _Morning
Constitutional_ in this issue of SLOPE.  (pretty thought provoking, tho I
have some small disagreements w/ it.)  Also, while I'm at it, the listing
for the book on amazon.com includes a blurb from Publishers Weekly.  (But
enough about me!...)     -m.

I'd love to be able to walk into a tailor's and say: please make me a suit.
I want to be dapper: I want lots of clothes that fit me. I like suits: but
dont own one. I can understand Snyder...but he wasnt just putting on a pose?
Snyder's important in the scheme of things as is Kerouac and was/is
Ginsberg...the unofficial "poet lauriate " of Auckland (NZ) Bob Orr I have
never seen in a suit. His style is "user-freindly" but can be very intense
and its "simplicity"  is deceptive.Steve Braunias of The NZ Listener called
him "New Zealand's greatest living poet" I know he reads widely and is a
good friend/aqauintance.  Like many poets he is fond of the odd "drop" and
when faced with the choice of giving up driving or booze he chose the
former. Bill Manhire, who doest over indulge very much I hear, and who
"stole" some ideas from Ashbery, is the "poet lauriate" of NZ .I dont know
him personally but he writes some brilliant poems. Of course whether Manhire
and the other "known" poets will last per se maybe irrelevant. Anycase Bill
as far as I know would be ok in a suit whereas Bob would as likely tell
anyone recommending such a sartorial move that they go away quickly.
Regards, Richard. PS These comments are to get you Americans out of your
shell and to realise the US is only an small country of relatively small
significance: there are other countries like NZ and Australia and France and
Luxemborg as well as the US.

Shiki, William Carlos Williams and Robert Desnos.  Her
long poem "The Color Series" was published in Ribot.

autobiographically.



Oh, drat.  And I so eagerly had my credit card poised
to order.

~More~ biographical reductivism? (?!)

Is there no end to this ~People Magazine~ school of
criticism recidivist trend of reading de-subject-ifed
text through insiders' information about the private
life of the (theoretically extinct [:Barthes]) author?


I've presented on Howe only once at an academic
conference, a fluke, (--- to paradoxically reverse my
protest against personist criticism with an ostensibly
personist retort ---) and published criticism/reviews
of her books only twice (aside from that, my scansion
Howe postings here this past spring serve as the only
remaining public tip-of-the-iceberg evidence of
in-depth involvement),--- but everything I've been
able to amateurishly contrive about her, the "vertical
reading," the interpretation of ~Bed Hangings,~ etc.,
was done without this wizard's stone of the
conveniently neurotic Oedipal facticity of biograpy;
and an entire factory of critics could have gone on
writing from now until the deforestation of all paper
sources similarly explicating her books along
suprapersonal lines.

What a disappointment, what a crushing disappointment,
--- and how perplexing! --- that the first full-length
book on our greatest living poet is reported to resort
to the universally infallible decoder key of Reading
Through The Life.

...As though as indomitable a suprapersonalizer as
Mary Magdalene's ~noli me tangere~ from Howe's
depicted Risen Christ Himself didn't insist on
transcendentalisms larger than one-woman
(auto)biography.

Language poetry = covert Confessionalism?

>> This study debunks the myth of Howe's
impenetrability

One might've chosen a less frustratedly phallic, more
invagination-friendly predicate for her
unfathomability.

This topic came up on another list but it is intriguing.  Unless I =
disremember, most poetry byand/or for the 'working class' tends to be =
traditional and focused on content rather than form?   I'm not sure if =
this is writing down or writing for?  Counter examples welcome.

   Is this the John Fahey who used to live in Venice, Calif?   I saw him
onstage several times -- once so drunk he sort of aimed for a chair and hit
the floor -- he always played like an angel, in any condition.  When I found
out where he lived, I used to just go sit outside his place and listen to
him play.  I was in my young teens, way too afraid to knock on the door.

out of Mississippi delta mud that rattled
my nine year old Los Angeles bones.
I wanted to deserve him.

Dear friends:
There has been a little misunderstanding about Jacket magazine on the talk=

circuits of the Net, which is entirely my fault. Announcing Jacket 16=20
recently, I said:
_______________________

Announcing (well, pre-announcing) Jacket 16,

...another Special Giant Bumper Issue, again, already:

and I would get to work on number 17. And so on.

In fact I have been uploading bits and pieces to all the Jacket  issues up=

December 2002. You can reach them all from the links at the top of the=20

I have no plans to close Jacket.
And I promise to think more clearly in future!!

In the meantime, Jacket 16 has been growing bit by bit:

One publication for whom I review poetry is The Oregonian, Portland's =
daily newspaper. Thus I am interested in reading regional poetry. If you =
want to send me books for consideration--the Book Review Editor makes =
the choices, and, of course, there is limited space--please contact me =
off-list and I will send you my mailing address.

Vincent's beautiful campus on the Hudson.

We will be having our first meeting on February 26, 7 p.m., at The
Society for Ethical Culture, 4450 Fieldston Road, in the Riverdale
section of the Bronx.

The success of the festival will depend on our volunteer base, which
will ensure that it will become a flagship event for the Bronx!  Some of
the top names in both poetry and music will take part, and we want our
exoterica friends to be part of it too.

Please RSVP if you would like to attend.  We need you.

There will be tattoos; there will be banjos.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you won't want to miss the Zinc Bar reading series featuring

Sunday, February 24th: Jen Coleman & Aaron Kiely

Coleman, described by curator D Rothschild as a "poet of the fantastical" and Kiely, described by Rothschild as "romantic and postromantic" are going to rock the house.  Hope to see you.

Readings start at 6:37 pm. Zinc Bar is downstairs at 90 west houston--just
off the corner of LaGuardia Place.  Take the F train to 2nd Ave and walk south to Houston.

One day a few years back, Mike Basinski handed me this poem out of the blue
- er, actually, out of an unspecified poetry mag - "with zen simplicity."
It now hangs over my desk. The first impulse might be to read the piece as
unsophisticated acting out - and I'd have to say, yeah, that's part of the
point too. But then take a moment to admire the permutations of the first
stanza, or the way that line breaks are used to alter the rhythm of the
second and third. There's a level of attention here that repays like.

we go to the poetry forums
we go to hear the poets read

hear the Karl Shapiro read
in forty different lays
but never really saying
FUCK YOU YOU IGNORANT PIGS
thats why the Karl Shapiro
is a great poet

hear the new young poets
imitate the master
telling the bourgeosie
to get fucked in forty
different ways but never
really just out and saying
FUCK YOU YOU IGNORANT PIGS

hear the d. a. levy
hear the ed sanders
standing on their heads
in full lotus blossom positions
telling the bourgeoisie
with zen simplicity
FUCK YOU YOU IGNORANT PIGS

(there is no moral to this poem)

I am definitely an "amateur" when it comes to Susan
Howe (in all the good senses of that word), but
honestly, I mostly have always read her work
autobiographically.

But I don't mean "use a decoder ring and insider
information on Susan Howe's life to unlock the meaning
of these weird-ass books" autobiographical. I mean
"there is a speaking subject of these poems which are
emotionally realistic to me and have immediate
relevance to my--and her--emotional life"
autobiographical.

How do you read something like "Europe of Trusts"
otherwise? How much more autobriographical can you get
than the books in "Frame Structures"--even without the
new introduction...

It also makes me think of that remark of Rosmarie
Waldrop's (where did I read that?)--she's talking
about how all her poems were about her mother, so she
(as a cure for this ailment) began constructing poems
out of lines chosen at random from books on her
bookshelf but (as she says) "they were still all about
my mother."

I guess it's a pretty old argument...one I don't
really have the critical education (or the schooling)
to engage in, but I (naively, perhaps) always thought
Susan Howe's heart was pretty much on her sleeve.
Which always distinguished her as a writer for me.

The reason I am really interested in the book is to
see what exactly RTB's claim is and how she backs it
all up.

As for impenetrability...phallic indeed...I also
happen to wish more poetry could be mysterious and
enraptured and possessed. but it'll be like that.

I read RTB's book of poems "Azimuth" and liked it well
enough to think I'd read the Howe book even if I
wasn't nuts about the subject. Which I am.

Besides, don't be disappointed. Someone else will just
have to write a different book.

"conveniently neurotic Oedipal facticity of biograpy"

"kneel to intellect in our work
chaos cast cold intellect back"

(including this--and any other--book, i imagine)

Howe does seem like the last poet I'd want to read autobiographically. Her
themes are squarely in mythology or history or literature, and I can't
imagine how knowing about her life would help.  Even if it did, I think it
would lessen the impact of the poetry, not expand it.  If Howe were
experiencing a difficult to hide illicit love affair at the time she wrote
about Tristan and Iseut, I don't want to hear about it!  It would disappoint
me to think that's why she wrote that poem (I'm thinking of part of
Pierce-Arrow).  It's generally true that most people write poems because of
something psychological (obviously, we do everything because of _something_
psychological/biological/whatever; we can't be explained at the intellectual
level alone), but it is more respectful and more sensible to approach a poet
according to the thematic and intellectual strains in her work than by
attributing everything to her personal life.  I mean, if we were to learn
that Howe wrote the beginning of Pierce Arrow because she was able to work
better since her cat was in the cat hospital after a neutering opewration,
so wasn't comppeting with poetry for her attention, what good would that do
us?  It is ridiculous....  I assume the book in question does not present
this kind of ridiculous detail, but in some sense, all biographical
criticism is like this, at least if the poet if not autobiographical in her
work.

I have found knowing the biography useful in reading other poets,
specifically poets whose biography is assumed knowledge in their works.  For
example, reading Robert Lowell without knowing about his family (for the
early poems), his conversion to Roman Catholicism, his wives, daughters, and
breakdowns, is somewhat difficult.  The blatantly confessional poems speak
for themselves, but the poems that follow just assume we know this material,
and if we don't, they don't quite make sense.  But I think that current
poetic trends are not in favor of autobiographical poets (except perhaps for
Afro-American female poets); it just doesn't matter who a Language poet is
in real life, and it probably matters even less who a formalist poet is.

Millie

P.S.

By the way, what do you call the type of poetry that Ashbery writes? It's
not Language (it precedes it), it's not new Formalism obviously, is just
plain "postmodern" specific enough to describe a style?  It seems too
vague...  Also, what about the styles of non-elite poets?  You know, the
kind that are perfectly good, and read by many of us, but not trend-setters.
They tend to used a "realistic" style, but not a formal one, more of a plain
free verse thing.  Some really stand out though and I think they are better
than mediocre, like Goldbarth or Nicholas Christopher (in 5 degrees
especially)...  How would you describe these poets style (they're obviously
not the same...

Here's a little story about Fahey.  Many years ago I was at a party at Helen
Schneyer's house  - she was a kind of den mother to our little band of
folkies -- and one of our group, Ed Morris, a good blues guitar player -- was
doing an old tune -- it may have been a Robert Johnson piece.  A fellow that
none of us knew remarked very kindly that he had never heard that piece in an
open D tuning.  Ed glared at him and said that it was the tuning that Robert
Johnson had used, but the stranger insisted that Johnson had played it in an
open E tuning.  Ed became very agitated and snottily replied that the
stranger didn't know what the hell he was talking about, and that the only
person in the world who could tell him (Ed) that he was wrong was John Fahey.
 Whereupon the stranger said, "I am John Fahey", and poor Ed's eyes bulged
wide and his face turned the color of fresh blood, and he thrust his guitar
to Fahey, exclaiming "you're John Fahey?  What the hell am I doing playing
guitar when you're here!"

has anyone read loss glazier's new book, digital poetics, alabama,
2002?

first of all congratulations loss, i know it must be lots of hard work to
get a book like this out.

it is a fairly good introduction to the field for those who have little
experience of this field.

so for me the first half was sort of going over a lot of stuff i already
knew.

the most important point  loss makes, i believe, is that
hypertext/hypermedia poetry is not hypertext/hypermedia prose.

they are read differently, they are experienced differently, they are
recognised differently, but, unfortunately they are often spoken
about and critiqueds as if they were the same thing.
unfortunately the differences are not spelt out clearly enough, and
this conclusion comes half way through the book, after loss also
referred to both interchangeably when he spoke of the development
of the field. so for me there is a little contradiction.

also the parts about eastgate/storyspace dominating the field of
hypermedia/hypertext and establishing hierarchies of value, and
economies of exchange is very thought provoking. as well the
observation that eastgate are dealing mainly with hypertexts that
suit a contained medium like cd-rom rather than 'cybertexts' on the
web is relevant.

but the setting up of oppositional positions
joyce/bolter/landow versus cayley/glazier
weakens everything that has been said and personalizes the
arguments that are being made.

i personally think that many prose text analysts/theorists have made
the transition to the web over the last five years, and bring with them
prejudices from print medium.

ie
poetry is read the same way as prose,
prose is better than poetry,
performance is less serious than written or printed poetry,
visual aspects of e-
poetries/cyberpoetry/webpoetry/netpoetry/poetries in
programmable media are only decorative,

what do other people think?

also it is difficult in a book like this, when the author has been at the
forefront of development in this field, not to seem a little self-
promotional in quoting your own work.

i haven't seen any discussion of the book here or at e-Poetry so i
thought i'd get the ball rolling.

cheers
love

***

Masters of the mot juste, duke and duchess of the dancing aside, Tom =
Raworth
and Rae Armantrout give the quick-take a tug out to unexpected =
longitudes.
Come watch Tom unstitch the monostiche into the sort of beard bramble =
you'd
pull off a mugging Ivor Cutler, unsettling the strong bright eggs from =
a
neglected nest. Come see Rae unwrap the rap at a fierce diagonal, daisy
chaining the dailies to make a tafetta bloom out of doubt, like Galileo =

Above Islands / Dan Machlin & Serena Jost
(IACD03 - Released February 2002)

The 3rd Immanent Audio CD, Above Islands is the first release by the
collaborative talents of poet Dan Machlin & musician Serena Jost.

Using cello, Casio, string machine, guitar, accordion and voice, the
work on Above Islands easily and charmingly breaks through the
barrier separating irony from earnestness. In addition to original
songs, compositions and / or sound events, the recording contains
settings of two H.D. pieces that will break your goddamn heart.

this is a sort of bromide, or cliche, or whatever, but it ain't necessarily
so:  check out Meridel Le Sueur's work, and Annie Ernaux's Cleaned Out,
Kenneth Patchen, Kenneth Fearing, Mark Nowak, etc etc.

Komninos,

Thanks for your detailed and thoughtful reply to _Digital Poetics_. It is
good to hear a response from someone who also has an interest in the
possibilities of poetry and image in the medium. I'm appreciative of your
wish to open discussion on the book in this regard.

Thinking about your post, I would comment that one of the book's urgencies
*is* the need for distinctions to be made at this point in the development
of the field.

If you look at the axes that are suggested in the book, Joyce/Bolter/Landow
and Kac/Cayley/Rosenberg (other readers may wish to note this
clarification), it should first be observed that these axes are proposed in
order to examine "authority", i.e., citations of secondary sources
received. This is done to suggest how a sense of influence in the medium
might be mapped. The point is that prose theorists and practitioners in the
medium have occupied -- if not a totalizing position in terms of attention,
criticism, and influence -- one that is at minimum dominant.

The main intention of this argument, far from wanting to personalize, is to
say that now is the time to observe the situation. Indeed, if not now at
this nascent moment in the development of the field, there is much that
will be overlooked. This is not a gesture towards personalization but one
towards delineating crucial distinctions.

That is, poetry practice in the field has, until now, *not* been directly
expressed. (A look at any bibliography of books published on electronic
literature would confirm this.) In order to chart the field of digital
poetic practice, distinctions should be made. One can only make such
distinctions by citing specific practitioners.

All in all, the book argues, it is time to talk about digital *poetry*, a
point with which you seem to agree. If digital literature has its "prose
and versus", _Digital Poetics_ seeks to position its verses.

When such a dominant structure exists for electronic prose -- yes -- one
must look at which practitioners fall into which camps. This is not simply
a necessary way to approach this mostly ignored side of practice but a way
to vitalize the discussion of the whole of digital literature, since
digital poetry provides approaches unique in its range of poetics.

Again, thanks for your interesting thoughts!

Warmest wishes from the frozen north,
Loss

This exhibition is the first United States presentation of work by
Japanese artist, Mayumi Terada.
On exhibition at The ANNEX is the work dollhouse series, 2001, large
scale, black and white
photographs depicting interior spaces illuminating furniture, windows,
doorways, and stairs.
The artist's dollhouse series was created out of construction paper. She
photographs the
houses holding them up to natural light. Transforming the
three-dimensional microcosm into
a space perceived to be of human scale Terada plays with our perception
of actual and virtual
reality.

Fahey tapes got me across the US several times in the late 60s and early
70s. A superb musician, and a superb musical mind.

First define working class poet--the poet worked in a factory, or the
poet's parents?

Waht say you knew nothing about any poets, not even their names: ever? How
would you go? I'm not saying you're wrong - I was just reading this and that
occurred to me.  Just an interesting concept. Maybe not so original, but it
would be the real McCoy: the real "Death of the Author".  I agree that
knowing something of the cofessionals is  (or seems to be) more important
than knowing so much about: well we know nothing of the author of...what's a
good example(s)  Pynchon? The author of "The Pearl", of "Piers Ploughan" or
even much about Shakespear: would matter if we knew absolutely nothing about
W Shakespeare?  And so on. Regards, Richard

RICHARD SEIBURTH
Pound & Picabia
    "In late 1920, age thirty-five, nel mezzo del cammin, Pound found
himself at a crisis point in his career: the Cantos were not
progressing,
he had just been fired from his position as the Athenaeumís drama
critic, his most recent volume of verse, Quia Pauper Amavi, had been
poorly received, and for a brief period, he apparently even considered
returning to America to take up the study of medicine in the footsteps
of his friend William Carlos Williams."
    This is how Richard Sieburth, in his essay Dada Pound, characterizes

Poundís state of mind as he was about to meet Francis Picabia, "the
dynamic behind Dada," in 1921. Sieburth sees in their meeting,
enormous consequences to Poundís elaboration of the section of the
Cantos that were produced right after. The strategies of quotations
and misquotations, of displacement and fragmentationówhich were
part of Dadaís overall attempt to disrupt the semantic function of the
ideological sign system that made World War I possibleówill eventually
find way in Poundís Cantos, together with explicit quotes from and
references to Picabia.
    Richard Sieburth will revisit his text, which was originally
published
in The South Atlantic Quarterly, in 1984, by way of an informal
conversation with A.S.Bessa.

A thought on Rachel Back's Susan Howe book:  read it.  I think that
you'll find it's much more of an extended source study (among other
things) than a biographical reading or biographical decoding.

    Marge Piercy.  Union organizers use her poems, and they get xeroxed and

AND Fahey had lived in the D.C. suburbs for a time in my youth -- He was a
remarkable presence on the music scene -- always encouraging other
musicians, getting them recorded --- I used to strum chords with him when
he would pass through Dupont Circle from whichever part of the country he
was living in at the time --

I'm looking for articles/essays on Zukofsky as translator. So far, I've
found only the three pieces in Zukofsky Man and Poet (by Burton Hatlen,
Guy Davenport, and David Gordon). If you know of any other stuff, I'd be
very happy to find out.

You again, me again, Shannon. Impossible to find Alex Cigale unless
perhaps you look him up as a name on Google or Ilor. I have had in the
last 8 years a  number of poems published in his Synaesthetic but he
changes address and phone so often and is so late in responding that it
takes detective work to track him down. You might try to look up the
Russian-English-avant-garde magazine Koja, which has also published me.I
forget who is now editor (Mike Basinski?), but Alex belongs to a group
of Russians, now publishing in both languages in both magazines. His
"next" Synaesthetic,  with several of my poems promised to it,  hasn't
appeared for two or three years now.

Best wishes,
Irving

well for the record:  the question of prose v. poetry as a template
for discussing hypertext (and hypermedia) was raised at least a
decade ago on the old technoculture list that stuart moulthrop ran
while at georgia tech... some of us found the problematic of
narrative linearity---and nonlinearity, and multilinearity,
etc.---somewhat beside the point when considered in light of poetic
practice per se... i know that my own work in emedia was shaped by an
awareness that storyspace linking and guard fields and the like took
on a different valence when such protocols weren't being used to
break up plot per se... and i also have 1st hand experience (if you
will, and if i may be pemitted to say this publicly) in having work
that combined prose narrative and poetry, and mixed genres, rejected
on the basis of its presumably too "disjunctive" status (though of
course, i might have failed too at some aesthetic level, i'll grant
this!--- but i was given to understand by my readers, more than once,
that disjunctiveness was an issue for them)...

all of which is to say that i don't find the poetry v. prose argument
esp. new, though loss lays it out in greater detail than anyone who's
come before...

now in just browsing through loss's book, the aspect of it that i
most appreciate at this point is its emphasis of the work of folks
like eduardo kac and john cayley *in addition to* the more
narrative-based writers, the latter more typically cited in english
studies-based accounts of electronic media (which isn't to say
anything "against" the latter, either)... not to focus too awful much
on omissions, but i'm distressed not to see alan sondheim's name come
up (right?---incl. the focus one finds in that recent ~american book
review~ on "codework"), and i think the argument might have done well
to take account of some of the more arts-oriented discussions of
emedia (e.g., martin rosenberg's discussion of hypertext and duchamp
and physics in landow's ~hyper/text/theory~... it was martin in fact
who introduced me some years ago to eduardo kac)... i also have some
reservations about an overt emphasis on "poetry v. prose" in any
case, as i would assume most of us are well aware of the experimental
fiction community, which seems to drop entirely out of the mix the
moment we start drawing up such distinctions (mark amerika's name
comes immediately to mind)...

i also think the book doesn't give enough due to a list like
technoculture, which, from an historical perspective, was a primary
breeding ground (if you will) for so much theory that has followed in
its wake... i mean, i can see history being shaped by books like
~digital poetics~, and whereas i enjoy the book and think it of great
value, i can't say, for the record, that i'm entirely happy with the
history that thereby emerges (or seems to, in my reading of it thus
far)... perhaps mcgann's thematic, "conditions of textuality," is a
bit less empirical than i would have liked, in all, though i can
understand its benefits to loss's analysis... in any case a history
as such of the past dozen years of emedia has, as i see it, yet to be
writ, and it certainly won't be entirely independent of the sort of
history one finds in hawisher et al., ~computers and the teaching of
writing in american higher education, 1979-1994:  a history~...

best,

joe

i agree w/ mister kazim ali: there's a lot more to autobiographical writing
than match-the-poetry-to-a-specific-event-in-the-poet's-life.  a person
lives in history, in culture.  doesn't it make a difference that she lives
in the 20th century and not the 19th?  doesn't it make a difference that
she grew up in certain powerful historical  environs (new england) which
continue to provide source material for her work?  biography is much more
than events in a private life --tho' at times, those are significant too.
it's easy to dismiss a reductive understanding of biography, but that's not
the whole story.

Unlike California, who asked Gary Snyder to be its Poet Laureate, whom I'd
nominate for Brooklyn would be Duke Snyder, he of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Alive or dead, what's the difference when it comes to Zen Masters or
Centerfielders?

Voices of the Americas Festival

http://www.fva.ca

--spoken word in all its guises

February 26th - March 3rd, 2002

We are happy to announce the inauguration of Le Festival Voix
d'Ameriques / Voices of the Americas Festival (FVA), a new
bilingual festival dedicated entirely to oral literature.

The FVA 2002 will happen over a six-day period, from Tuesday,
February 26th until Sunday, March 3rd. Four types of
activities will be held for this first edition of the
festival.

Nightly from February 26 to March 3 starting at 8 pm there
will be 6 cabarets, each evening highlighting three different
themes/styles of literature in performance, uniting 54
artists: storytelling, theatre, poetry, spoken word,
multimedia, monologues, first nations, emerging artists and
more...

In the late afternoon (5 to 7 pm) on February 27 and 28 and
March 1 and 2: four 'new discoveries' open mic spaces will
feature readings, storytelling, spoken word and slam poetry.

In the afternoon on February 27 and 28 and March 1 and 2: four
round table discussions:  - The relationship between music and
spoken word when the two are  combined; - a meeting with
Carole Boucher from the Canada Council  for the Arts (Spoken
and Electronic Words section);  - the role of new technologies
in the production of oral  literature; and - the current
renaissance in the practice of  storytelling.

Finally, on the morning of March 2 there will be a voice
technique workshop.

The FVA will take place in three well-known venues within a
block of each other on St-Laurent Boulevard:

* The launch of the event will be held at the Sergent
Recruteur (location of the now legendary weekly Dimanches du
conte): 4650 St-Laurent, (514) 287-1412

* Nightly cabarets will be presented at the Sala Rossa: 4848
St-Laurent at 8PM.

* The 5-7 PM open mike events will be held at the Sergent
Recruteur: 4650 St-Laurent, (514) 287-1412

* The Round Table discussions will take place from 2:30 - 4:30
at the Casa del Popolo (swiftly becoming a cornerstone of
underground music and cultural happenings in Anglophone
Montreal): 4873 St-Laurent, (514) 284-3804.
Boulevard St. Laurent was chosen as it is an important
location in the history of literature and the culture of
Montreal. The long-standing symbolic 'divide' between
Francophone and Anglophone cultures, the street is also a

Background

The FVA is presented by Productions si on r=EAvait encore, a
non-profit organization whose mandate is to promote oral
literature (l'oralit=E9) and all the unique forms that have
emerged from spoken word's interdisciplinary nature.
This new production company, its mission and the introduction
of this new festival are a result of the efforts of Andr=E9
Lemelin, an artist, organizer and producer of cultural events
who continues celebrating the written and spoken word (Stop
magazine, Lectures journal, Exit poetry magazine, Dimanches du
conte storytelling night, Plan=E8te rebelle press).

During the last decade, artists working with the word have
become more numerous, visible and present among the various
Montreal arts scenes (in previous years,  at Foufounes
electrique, Isart, Bistro 4, cafe Phoenix; more  recently at
Jailhouse, Casa Del Popolo and Sala Rossa).  However, they
continue to be relatively isolated from each  other, with no
one venue or event bringing them together in  a coherent
collective. The Voices of the Americas festival  will attempt
to present the entire range of spoken word in  Qu=E9bec as well
as giving its practitioners a chance to come  together,
witness each others' creations and engage in creative
exchanges.

The FVA plans to produce an annual event revolving around the
'spoken' word. It will showcase artists' existing performance
works and invite them to present new works for the festival.

At the helm of the FVA is Andr=E9 Lemelin, general director of
the festival and director of artistic programming.

His support crew of artistic advisors includes Jean-Marc
Massie (storytelling - host of Dimanches du conte); Pierre
Thibeault (First Nations artists - an organizer of the
Presences autochtones Festival); Sonia Pelletier (performance
artists, South American artists - curator); D.Kimm (theatre
artists, poets - writer); and Yannick B. Gelinas (multimedia
artists - visual artist)

For the artistic direction of Anglophone programming, Lemelin
has enlisted Ian Ferrier (poet and musician) and Victoria
Stanton (performance artist and co-author of Impure:
Reinventing the word) as well as Mike Burns (Montreal
Intercultural Storytelling Festival - storyteller) and Estelle
Rosen (Theatre events organizer).

MarieLyne Durocher is assistant director / director of
communications, while Denis Bigras (Festival des Films du
Monde) is the production director.

What I "had trouble with" in ~Digital Poetics~ was not
the New Media treatment, which seems fair, as much as
a more fundamental sort of ontological or metaphysical
distinction he makes about "multiple "I's"': that
becomes the basis for not just the following New Media
assumptions, but for poetics both on-line and on-page.
  He calls it the "key feature." I'll present his
position and then my disagreement.  I quote at length
(with commentary) for those who haven't bought the
book:

'The position of the "I" is a crucial distinction
between non-innovative and innovative literature.  How
the "I" is constituted in a text says much about that
text's writing practice.  Does the "I" assert forms of
authority?  Is it unquestionably a nonpermeable (or
semipermeable) filter between the ego and the world?"

----But how does Loss hair-splits between ego and "I"
above?  They're synonyms.

He passingly cites Williams ('Whenever I say, 'I' I
mean also, 'you'"), Rimbaud's "Je, c'est l'autre,"
Spicer's Martian radio, Hannah Weiner's
audiohallucination-dictations, Creeley ("As soon as /
I speak, I / speaks"), and Mac Low's eventual
post-chance defeatism "that there is no such thing as
nonegoiac art".

Against the "I," Glazier poses the collective, . . .
but perhaps oddly: 'The notion of our nation as
multicultural . . . insists that a "nation" can be
made of a plurality of identities rather than a sole
stereotypical one."

(Further slippage of terms: from "I" to ego and then
on to "identities."  ---  Although identity is also
true of the non-"I" subconscious.)  '

'Such a perspective can be socially beneficial in a
heterogeneous society as it obviates, for one thing,
the need for one "I" to be more valid than others,'---
although he then flipflops the collective into a
proven evil: 'holocausts, acts of genocide, and
interpersonal violence'.

No dispute with his points about the fallaciousness of
the autonomous "I" (or subject).  It's just that the
"I" can be de-coupled from its false autonomy and
remain a contingent "I"

(rather than throwing baby out, bathwater, etc).  Then
the subsequent Web talk is predicated upon these
'multiple "I's"':

'Such examples of the possiblity of multiple or
"distributed" identity lead us to consider the text as
not singular and isolated but more like the "I" of the
Internet.  The web can be seen as such a multiple
text, being composed of endless varying pages or
"I's."'  (…From "I" to ego to identity to--- ~pages,~
although pages are no more the "I" than, conversely,
ID cards are.)  'Its pages are like the cells that
fall off the "I" of the human body" (…not to belabor
the ongoing slippage with Descartes' accomplishment of
retaining "I" ~without~ body,--- or the haywire
syllogism: pages are "I's" are like cells of the body
but the body is "I," where the whole becomes a part
and then re-emerges out of that part as a different
part that is the whole, etc).

Comically, he then dashes the whole "distribution"
with the normal colloquialism: "In this vein, ~I~
published a volume of poetry . . ."

So, that's Glazier.

I sketched out some of my botherment in a letter to
Geoffrey Gatza on January 27th, so I'll just quote
that, for now:

-------------------------------------------------------------

I used to say the same thing as Glazier, that the "I"s
have it, and that that's the distinguishing feature
between innovation and non-innovative, the heart of
the battle.  I might still have agreed and let it slip
by, except that I'm at the moment very much under the
influence of also reading Deleuze's ~Logic of Sense~
(in English; I've read it in French before, and didn't
catch what I'm getting this round).

Deleuze introduces the "I"-dimension in a very special
and technical semiotic way.

First, there's the level of denotation, where there's
a pure statement, and that statement is either
true/false, or absurd: "It is snowing outside"/"It is
raining cats and dogs, literally".

(There is a veterinarian's kennel on the second story
of a building where there's a fire, and orderlies toss
the animals out the windows into the arms of firemen
and people below: "It is raining cats and dogs,
literally.")

But in order for it be uttered, there has to be a
second level, which he calls manifestation: "I heard
on the radio that it is snowing outside"/"Whenever I
fall asleep during the day, I dream that it is raining
cats and dogs, literally."

Even where that manifestation-"I" isn't present, it's
implicit.  Your mother looks out the window and says,
"It is raining outside," which is to say, she is
implicitly stating: I just saw that it is raining
outside.

The manifestation-"I" (or "I"s, if Glazier and Buffalo
are right) is an absolutely necessary precondition for
the statement's denotation.  If the "I" who makes the
statement about it snowing is a known liar (Cretan
paradox) or
practical joker, the denotation is recast in light of
that, and the T/F value is suspended until further
confirmation due to the unreliability of the narrator.
 Etc.

What Glazier is calling multiple "I"s is really School
of Buffalo.  Most of that writing (asyntactical)
doesn't have multiple "I"s and it doesn't have a
single "I": it has ~no~ "I".

So,--- that's the base out of which my "contention"
precedes: the divisions of personality and identity
that we harbor as individuals, mainly due to the
work/leisure office/home split, do not radically alter
our manifestation of propositions.  ("When I said, 'It
is snowing outside,' and I was mistaken, you have to
understand, I was just speaking informally, not in my
capacity as a professional weather man.")

Of course, Glazier shuffles the bean game a little by
slipping between Mac Low's Buddhist pursuit of
"non-egoic" writing, to single-authored "multiple I"
writing, to communities and society in general where
of course there are multiple I's because each I is a
surrogate for an individual person or person's name:
"Geoffrey in Buffalo says it is snowing", "mez in
Australia says it is snowing" (where it cannot be
snowing, since it is summer).

In the case of community, though, he's muddying his
terminology, because he really means ~perspectives.~

...Which is similar to my next gripe with him:

I think he's using "multiple Is" to refer to what
otherwise could be called "voices" or "characters".
Lon Cheney Sr. "The Man with a Thousand Faces" was not
a case of "multiple Is": those were characters; it was
still clear when T.S. Eliot first titled "The Waste
Land" as "He Do The Police in Many Voices".

Multiple Is is actually a pathological condition:
Multiple Personality, or its lesser version
Disassociation Syndrome.  And while I'd agree that the
incidence of Disassociation Syndrome has become
tremendously on the rise in America, that's not what
Glazier is talking about.

My third disagreement is that he's talking about "I"
as a ~starting point~ of communication (despite the
scientist whom he quotes about our receptivity and
passivity to perceptual stimuli): "I'm the one talking
now and this is what I have to say---".

The "I" remains intact, though, as a ~reception
point.~  Glazier, as "receptor" or reader of different
poetries, will consistently class some as innovative
and some as non-innovative.  That's because he is
single-I'ed, as a reception point.

The singularity of "I" is absolutely necessary as the
target or end point of a communication, even if the
"I" of the sender were debateable.

And my last and fourth disagreement is about the
internal/external function of "I" or ego.  (Now I'll
switch to calling "I" ego.)  Ego is a mediation
between id and super-ego, that is, between sprawling
polymorphous perverse desire and the controlling
authorities (including fate and necessity) that
interfere with the gratification of that id.  Without
an "I",  the personality just rocks back and forth
between
impulsive craving and fantasy, and neutralizing
agencies of authority that deny those impulses.  "I"
is a mechanism that learns to compromise between
fantasy and authority (reality), that learns to delay
and to work in order to fulfill desires.

I don't see where there's room for Glazierian
multiplicity in ego function.  Competing egos within
the same person do not help maintain any distance
between id and super-ego, ... although, to a certain
extent, I could understand and acknowledge that we
possess ~auxiliary~ "I"s which, when the
disappointment to one ego-zone becomes too crushingly
disappointing and the id is either threatened with
starvation or at risk of rebellion, can be called into
play: "He couldn't marry his mother, so he became a
priest devoted to the Virgin Mary."  But there any "I"
is serving as ~the~ "I" at the moment it's in
operation.  It doesn't matter ~who~ the batter is for
there to be a baseball game, but there ~must~ be a
batter.  Likewise, "I".

I guess I do have a fifth (and maybe "multiple," down
the road!) objection.

Despite the loose use of the word "ego",
conversationally, when we mean pride, greed, or
ambition, the risk of our times is not from the "I" or
egomania (the Me Generation is over).  The danger of
our times is the transformation of individuals, of
people, into statistics, into enumeration.  There are
no longer faces in an audience; there's the number of
"hits" for a site.  The stock market graph line, of
course, epitomizes that tendency: the labor of
hundreds of thousands, the symbolic exchange that
motivates and accrues out of that labor, and the lives
of tens of thousands of finance industry service
sector workers who contribute to building the
symbolism that culminates in the Dow Jones average,
are all atomized, smaller than a hundredth of a pixel,
and the non-"I" graph line prevails.  (I'm not aiming
for simple
"anti-capitalism" by putting it this way.  The same is
true of any graph representation of people,--- or even
of an individual, when the abstractions are DNA and
chromosomes.)  It's not a good time for The Left to
abandon the "I".  The "I" has more effectively been
jettisoned by the cultures associated with The Right:
the "I"-subordination to an imaginary Christ in
fundamentalism, Super Bowl Sunday, . . .

The age of the ~masses~ needs to hold onto the "I",
even where that "I" has many voices and is versatile
and changeable.

>> I mean "there is a speaking subject of these poems
which are
emotionally realistic to me and have immediate
relevance to my--and her--emotional life"
autobiographical. <<

That's mistaking expressivity or Expressionism for
autobiography.  A feeling of empathic connectedness
and emotive verisimilitude is not memoir; it's timbre.

>>How do you read something like "Europe of Trusts"
otherwise?

Well, here's a very partial synopsis of my marginalia
from just the first hundred pages of EOT, to give the
outlines of how I've read it otherwise ---a sort of
concordance method (paragrammatics) I've called
"vertical reading":

serpent" (52)  "(Zodiac window)" (90)  "mathematical
starlight, zodiacal signs" (FRAME STRUCTURES, 105)


The book, and Howe's entire oeuvre, goes on and on
that way.

Not in any limiting way, but--- her books can be read
as the unfolding of about a dozen or less highly
stressed themes or verbatim reiterated words ("theme"
being one of them) and maybe a dozen more secondary
themes, --- re-combined and varied in musical
structures very much like the Schoenberg or other
composers she discusses elsewhere.  Howe is a kind of
literary Serialist composer.

The zodiacal wheel that I partially brought out at the
end, above, might almost be a figure for the
cyclical/cyclonic structures she circles through.
(The zodiac is an example of an ordinal but
non-hierarchical/non-causative chain.)


>> How much more autobriographical can you get
than the books in "Frame Structures"--even without the
new introduction... <<<

. . . But the "auto" behind "autobiographical" has to
be a particular, concrete, narrativized "auto," ---
autobiography is a sub-genre of realism or naturalism
--- and if you look at the "I" that appears throughout
"Frame Structures," she's of an entirely different
sort altogether:

"I kiss the wall's hole" (114, for Shakespeare), "I
dined with the destroyers" (108), "I cut out my tongue
in the forest" (102), "I sang for the besieged forces
/ sang to the ear of remote wheels" (101), "when next
I looked he was gone" (90), "starry circle of some
kind, of which I was one of the beads!" (81), "I bit
off and burned my fingers to keep from freezing" (71),
"I looked at our precise vanishing point on the
horizon", "I squeezed my baby flat as a pancake" (70),
"I stopped my chidren's eyes with wool / as the angel
did with Jacob" (66), "far off in the dread /
blindness I heard light / eagerly I struck my foot /
against a stone" (56), "I count the clouds others
count the seasons" (53), "I the Fly" (80).

It's either luridly imaginative in a way that shifts
the trace of person into an environment of fable or
legend that is not autobiographical, or---

the subject has been reoriented toward an immaterial
object (vanishing point, enumerating clouds, the
synaesthesia of hearing light) that no longer provides
the leverage of reality needed for a biographical
subject, so that the "I," as if the eternity of these
strange objects traveled back along the relation like
an electric charge, becomes as nebulous, if not more
so, than the clouds.

>> It also makes me think of that remark of Rosmarie
Waldrop's (where did I read that?)--she's talking
about how all her poems were about her mother, so she
(as a cure for this ailment) began constructing poems
out of lines chosen at random from books on her
bookshelf but (as she says) "they were still all about
my mother." <<

But if you look at The Mother (or father figures, and
kings) in Howe, what you'll find are archetypal
entities --- like a magnetic north --- that also don't
function along an autobiographical axis:

"I am looking for lucky Luck / I am his mother" (EOT,
178), "Inward memory / Mystery passing myth sanctuary
/ Secret isle and mortal father" (146), "Dim artificer
enchantment proud / Father / Countless secrets hissing
together" (140), "Pursuer and pursuer / cloth
sky-color / Follow my mother" (131), "Anathema / who
was my father / Empty dominions beyond structure"
(114), "seeds to be sorted     Where / have I have I
been I say to myself    Mother" (52), "to Sleep
(where / are you crying) / crying for a mother's help"
(44), "Father's house forever falling" (41), "Midday
or morrow / move motherless" (40) "Mother and father /
turn downward your face" (31).

>> always thought Susan Howe's heart was pretty much
on her sleeve.

The tour de force that Howe accomplishes, of
viscerally awakening infantile longings for parent and
filial attachment (or any of her other passionate
communications), while still maintaining a thoroughly
"Language poetry" abstacted picture plane throughout,
that she, that ~anyone~ must've at some juncture in
the career experienced loss of a parent, say, ---
those elegiac and needy places within us and within
language do not require specific autobiography as
explanation.

The impact of "Mein Fader!  Mein Fader!" sung out in
Schubert's "Erlking" is only peripherally illuminated
by whatever we might learn about Schubert's real life
father and family.  (Some might say it even detracts.)


It may be easier to grasp in a medium which has less
representational capacity: music.  And especially
Serial music (twelve-tone), whose idioms remain
especially foreign to us, despite re-listenings.

George Perle painstakingly demonstrated that Alban
Berg's ~Lyric Suite~ contains encrypted in it, along
the onomastics of the well-known BACH B-A-C-H, or
Schumann's better-known A-S-C-H (initials for his
wife, himself, and a city important to their romance),
cryptographic records of his mistress, in great detail
and at points in every measure.  Schoenberg also
wrote, I believe it was, a string quartet which,
although we hear it as "pure" twelve-tone
Expressionism, followed the autobiographical narrative
of his heart attack and hospitalization to the letter:
 there's a ~male nurse~ theme, and a chord for ~the
injection!~

But, as fascinating as it may be to learn about this
sort of side-car of significance that rides beside the
piece itself, the representational angle of the
language, of the linguistic system, does not
accommodate the realistic pictography and narrative
that is necessary for what we mean by autobiography.
You can't hold the two in your head at the same time.
You cannot extrapolate out of the original the
supplementary "insider's information."

Any relation between the poetry of Howe, or Language
Poetry, --- or even John Ashbery, similarly
misappropriated by Shoptaw's and Lehman's biographical
misdirections, --- and the facts of their lives is
equally tangential, oblique in a way that deserves to
~remain~ oblique.  Legible autobiography was
~purposely~ excluded.  To try to restore it is like
autobiographizing personal content into a
mathematician's algebraic formulae.

There was the High/Low show at The Museum of Modern
Art.  They took Picasso's and Braque's newspaper
collages ---  Molly Nesbit does the same for Duchamp
and school children's ~cahiers~ --- and traced the
collaged pages back to their original sources.  The
same feat was performed for Max Ernst's collage
novels, ~Une Semaine de Beaute,~ etc.  But to reveal
the sources and original contexts of those inserts
does not conclude in some sort of end-point of now
knowing, meaningfully, the autobiography that Picasso
~subscribed to Le Figaro!,~  --- voila --- or that Max
Ernst haunted flea markets and bought old books of
lithographs.  The ~significance~ of any such
contemporaneous addenda takes place, at least in the
intentions of MOMA, rather in the discovery and
contrast between the rarified museum connotations of
those artworks and their earlier incarnation as low
culture detritus,--- like finding out that a frog was
once a tadpole.  The -graphy is one of the political,
of the class resonances of different literatures and
media; and how those different strata "collide" ("the
collisions and collusions of history"--- Howe); it's
not a Dickensian "I was born in such-and-such a place
on such-and-such a date" ~bildungsroman.~

Where I feel such an antipathy toward biographical
reductivism of experimental writing, too, is in the
totem we've made of ~facts.~  Once you have reached a
fact (the author experienced a divorce, came from
such-and-such a Brahmin background, outlived a loved
one), it's seen as having arrived at a dividing-line
that's "true," where you do not need to go any
further.

The fact, in our minds, in this misinterpretation, is
regarded as so real and so important and so
unsurpassable, with no Platonic idea standing in
behind it, that the search stops there, a kind of
detective story that has traced the "clues" to their
smoking pistol, to their "The End" reconstruction.

Freud dispensed with the question of whether it
mattered if paranormal (psychic) phenomena were real
or not.  What their variable true/false toggle only
lead to was ~what do they represent~ in the psyche,
what more ~mythic~ formula are they only the variable
evidence of, how to they signify, what would that
matter.

What's wrong with the equation of biography with
"Language poetry" is ~epistemological.~

(It also badly encourages the naïve next generation to
write their lives into cubism.)  It's always going to
be believable and provide another plane of plausible
reference to find out the facts of a writer's
biography,--- but it lacks validity, because the
translation or conversion of information moves in only
one direction: the biographical satisfyingly supplies
a scenario or ~mise en scene~ that grounds the
"impenetrable" poetry in a dimension we then explore
no further because it's our ideological dogma that a
domestic, familial narrative-personal dimension is the
beginning and end of everything.  But it ~counts,~
epistemologically, that the paraphrase ~cannot~ be
reversed, and that you cannot deduce from the
conclusion what's been induced into it.

A last example: the epic abstractionist Ellsworth
Kelly, whose work, to the eye, is surfboard-like
curves, arcs, pure but sensual geometries.  ~All~ of
his abstractions originate in completely specific
visual encounters, things he's seen and often
photographed in his day-to-day.

The art is a black-&-white of zigzags.  The source:
shadows of a railing on a staircase.

The origination of one from the other does not
maintain ~content~ in a way that constitutes
autobiography.





P.S.  John Ashbery's kind of poetry was called "New
York School."

I'm the Poet Laureate of my house. I've also been its undefeated
middleweight, light-heavyweight and cruiserweight boxing champion. (It pays
to keep out of fights.) When I spend next winter in Del Ray Beach, FL,
perhaps I'll seek the city's Poet Laureate slot so that I can write odes to
boxing promoter and fellow resident Don King and to the 9/11 terrorists who
lived around the corner from my condo and sent e-mail to their fellow
conspirators from the public library.

Dear Small Press Traffic Members, Funders, & Other Supporters of
Independent Literature,

I'm writing to let you know what's new at Small Press Traffic Literary
Arts Center at CCAC. As many of you know, our recent Poets Theater Jubilee
was a tremendous success; we sold out two evenings of new plays by
stunningly & philosophically wild playwrights including Tina Darragh, Dan
Farrell, Carla Harryman, David Larsen, Leslie Scalapino, and Chris
Vitiello. Poets Theater Jubilee got lots of attention in the local press
and allowed us to collaborate with New Langton Arts and the Jon Sims
Center for the Arts.

NEW SERIES

Small Press Traffic is in a growth spurt. Both our membership and our
attendance are up by over 30% from last year, and we have added two new
series, Crosstown Traffic and Series X, to our schedule. These series
augment our Friday night reading series. Crosstown Traffic is
interdisciplinary, bringing writers and artists in other fields together
in collaboration and conversation. Series X is a discussion series,
examining the uses of anarchy and tradition in literature and encouraging
the cross-pollination of creative thought across genre, media, and
politically/culturally contested spaces of all sorts.

READING SERIES

Andrew Maxwell and Liz Waldner, two extraordinary and splashy poets, gave
an astounding reading just last Friday, and coming up we have poet and
prose writers Rachel Levitsky and Fanny Howe coming to read at SPT next
Friday, March 1.

UPCOMING EVENTS

Two of our big upcoming events are the release party for the
just-published volume Technologies of Measure: A Celebration of Bay Area
Women Writers, which SPT produced for the FWord Feminist Arts Festival in
collaboration with Kelsey St. Press and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.
That's on March 8.

Then the first weekend in April we present a conference, Coordinates 2002:
Indigenous Writing Now, with participants including Native American
writers and scholars Paula Gunn Allen, Esther Belin, Diane Glancy, Cedar
Sigo, James Thomas Stevens, and Gerald Vizenor. That's April 5-7 here at
SPT at CCAC. The conference is free to the public and you are warmly
invited!

OUR ARCHIVE

Small Press Traffic's archive of small press books and ephemera dating
back to the 1950s is available for public research and pleasure at Simpson
Library, here on the San Francisco campus of CCAC. We've had folks from as
far away as New Zealand coming to use this great resource, and invite you
to, too!

MORE INFO

For more information on our programs and upcoming events, and a map to
guide you here, please call us for a current flyer (415-551-9278) or just
log on to our website at http://www.sptraffic.org. There's lots of good
reading on our site also!

The spring issue of our newsletter, TRAFFIC, has just gone out in the mail
to our members. If you are not a member and would like to become one, I am
thrilled! You can do so on our website or by picking up a membership form
at one of our events (we'd of course also be happy to mail you one -- just
ask!). Our members receive a year's free admission to all of our events, a
subscription to TRAFFIC, and our gratitude!

As I complete my second year at the helm of Small Press Traffic, I am
eager to hear feedback on our programming and publications from you, our
constituency.

I plan to send out these email updates every few months. If you prefer not
to receive them, please just reply to this message with a note to that
effect.

komninos, sure, i acknowledge that... i was impressed esp. to see kac
given his due... i had talked about his work in 1998, at a suny/stony
brook conference on new arts/new humanities, and only the arts depts.
folks seemed to have heard of him...

my referencing the hawisher volume was not meant to lay the emedia
situation squarely within u.s. confines... but do have a look at
same, as you'll realize that the ferment out of which you get a
michael joyce or a stuart moulthrop (and i should say up-front here
that these two guys are friends of mine from way back) is something
of the same ferment out of which you get a johndan johnson-eilola,
carolyn guyer, martha petry, j. yellowlees douglas, cindy selfe, and
many others---some of whom you'll find cited in loss's volume, some
of whom you won't...

broadly, some of the focus here can be captured by reviewing the
names on the editorial board of the journal ~computers and
composition~ (yes, you will find my name there too)... i wouldn't
want to reduce digital arts (a newer concept) to computers and
writing... but i met michael joyce at u of illinois @
urbana-champaign in 1991, as one of the writing practitioners brought
in to talk to us about hypertext (i sat up on the stage and clicked
through ~afternoon~ based on audience reading choices, as michael
read each passage aloud---well, this is perhaps a self-aggrandizing
way of putting it!)... it was gail hawisher (who coedits ~computers
and composition~ with cynthia selfe) who brought michael in, along
with jay bolter, (the late) james berlin, joseph williams, and others
(you will note that all of these folks are composition folks, or
affiliated with the teaching of writing, save for jay bolter---whose
~writing space~ was published on a press, lawrence erlbaum, that
boasts something of a social science/empirical take on composition,
and anything but a literary-critical orientation)... the first time i
met stuart moulthrop and nancy kaplan was at a computers and writing
conference in indianapolis... and the first hypertexts i rec'd from
my writing students as final projects, owing of course to
urbana-champaign's substantial funding for technology, are dated 1991
(bob jones, an 18th century lit scholar by training, as i recall, had
put together a helluva hypermedia lab at uiuc by the early 90s... in
fact i think he published an article on same in ~academic computing~
in the late 80s)...

that's one set of contexts that seems to me entirely vital, perhaps
more telling in historical terms that the prose/narrative bias (esp.
given the general *lack* of emphasis in writing circles on poetry and
poetics, though at one point, ~computers and composition~ published
poetry, kinda like ~college english~ used to do)...

another context might go something like this:  that the information
age thinking that led to the term "digital arts" have yet to fully
account for the sort of work you find in david porush's ~the soft
machine~ and steve heim's ~the cybernetics group~... i.e., as don
byrd long ago explained to me, if the history of cybernetics is ever
entirely unpacked, folks like heinz von foerster (and places like
urbana-champaign, where you can find on the shelves in the
communication library a copy of foerster's ~the cybernetics of
cybernetics~) will most assuredly loom large... loss does, to his
credit, give a brief summary of this situation (see the beginning of
his chapter 5, in which he also mentions brown's intermedia
project---another forerunner to all of this, and folks like nelson,
bush, etc.)...

but my sense, in any case, and to put it somewhat harshly, is that
what's happened here is what typically happens to the word
"composition" within english lit circles:  it tends to drop out of
the mix, and what's left becomes a matter of (in this case,
literary/digital) genre and formal classification and the like... the
larger insight would be that this is the way literary studies
codifies knowledge (and along with knowledge as such comes a sense of
history, of course)... still, the institutional ferment out of which
you get many of the current u.s. academic hypertext practitioners and
theorists (incl. yours truly) is underwritten by an orientation
toward writing-composition (and that dastardly academic term,
composition pedagogy)... fred kemp's MBU (megabyte university), the
first online list to which i subscribed (and the first in which i got
mself into the middle of a flamewar, with joseph williams, about what
properly constitutes a "theory"), was all about computers and
writing, and in fact, there was a proportionately greater number of
women on this online list than you might expect (which is in fact one
of the lessons of hawisher et al.'s history of computers and
writing)... there are other events that, to my way of thinking, were
kind of major---the online electronic salon held back in, was it
1992? by deakin u? (i think it was, just can't recall at the
moment)... and then there are the multiple volumes hawisher and selfe
have edited on computers and writing...

in all, i was pleased to see in ~digital poetics~ an emphasis on the
digital arts (emphasis on arts), but i am distressed to see the
writing communities of which i speak get such short-shrift... i
understand too that one book can't do it all---but given my druthers,
i would have liked to see more emphasis on this latter writing
history...

This is a fascinating and important topic for the list, one I've been very
much thinking about for several years.  I think Niedecker certainly needs to
be viewed from the perspective of class (as Arielle Greenberg has
mentioned)--I'd also highly recommend the HOW2 forum Robin cites--here are
some other references:

Maria Damon, _The Dark End of the Street_  (esp. look at Maria's discussion of
Ranciere's point about the bourgeois view of "worker poets" in 19th C France:
to what extent is "formal innovation" a "classed" category that threatens to
alienate workers from their own culture and reinforce hegemonic class values?)
[hi, maria!]

Cary Nelson, _Repression and Recovery_ makes a very good case for rethinking
the formal complexities of so-called "agitprop"

Although the essays in this book tend to oversimplify, _A Gift of Tongues_ (U
of Georgia P, 1987) has a couple of good essays on working-class poetics--one
of them (can't recall the author--Charlotte Nekola?) makes the point that
using the standard emphasis on linguistic complexity and innovative form to
judge worker poetry misses the whole point and fails to consider the "uses" of
poetry for various writers and readers in economically oppressed communities--

Ross Talarico, _Spreading the Word: Poetry and the Survival of Community in
America_ focuses on issues concerning the teaching of poetry in economically
oppressed communities--

Charlotte Nekola's intro to the section on women's radical poetry of the 1930s
in _Writing Red_ is also insightful--

Mark Van Wienen's _Partisans and Poets: The Political Work of American Poetry
in the Great War_ has a very insightful chapter on the formal complexities of
poetry by Wobblies--

(Sorry for the self-promo:) My own book, _Hearts and Minds: Bodies, Poetry,
and Resistance in the Vietnam Era_ discusses the formal innovations of
working-class GI poets during the Vietnam War--in particular, I argued that
the poetry of the GI Resistance often made form central to the expression of
its anti-military, anti-war political agenda--

To support what Maria's written in her follow-up e-mail to the inital post
that started this thread: to characterize the diff. between working-class
poetry and Poetry as a diff between form & content greatly
oversimplifies--further I think it threatens to strangely dehumanize "worker
poets" (only concerned [like O'Neill's "hairy ape"?] with brute, inarticulate
content--the concrete, the unsophisticated expression--why can't they develop
more sophisticated ways of thinking?  why can't they be more like "us"?)--it
also, of course, reiterates the old Lukacs/Brecht debates that seem, esp. now,
to be rather superfluous--and to judge worker poetry through the same
aesthetic values perpetuated by the academy seems to only reinforce the class
prejudices of the academy, to underscore its privilege--rather than trying to
understand the poetics actually being practiced by social groups outside the
self-identified literary culture, to understand how and why they use poetry,
in what way this poetry speaks to and addresses the needs of readers in these
social groups, the tendency is to impose an aesthetic ideology--(also see
Terry Eagleton's _Ideology of the Aesthetic_)

i could go on--but i gotta go "work"--

Tom Bell just pointed out to me what it was Duke Snider, not Snyder. Too bad
that Gary can't claim to be related to Duke, who owned his own suit.
I remember seeing Ginsberg in Berkeley, shortly after he's received a
Guggenheim, wearing a suit. I suspect he's the Poet Laureate of Nirvana..

Er, I am most definitely a counter-example.

This is an interesting topic but also one I feel twitchy about. I am most
definitely working-class, that is to say, not just born working-class but
remaining so. I do not write to the stereotypes of how working-class poets
should write. I use to be a shop-steward in my twenties, btw. But I find
debates on this matter restrictive from both sides, as it were, there are
those who carry around prescriptions of how us lower-classes should write,
while at the same time others tyles seem to have guardians installed to keep
out the hoi-polloi.

That people on this list might be uncomfortable with the idea of
working-class poets doesn't surprise me, I'm afraid to say, it's much the
same elsewhere. Those who are supposed to be silent shouldn't start
speaking, should they?

    Marge Piercy.  Union organizers use her poems, and they get xeroxed and

The Broken Angel

Something which is absent flows nonetheless.
The words contain the table they are written on.
You can rest your arm on them.
Simplicity belies itself, occasion
Does more than reach out, it annexes
Moments by subtracting them. Occasion
Leaks through time, catching its hold on
The rough textured edge of conviction.
The "I" aspires to stretch its arms,
Move about comfortably, settle in.
But the invisibility of response, the familiarity
Of a certain dance which takes its same turns
While everyone is watching, emotions, thoughts,
Predictions, choices shift into a perfectly orchestrated
Ensemble:-this would not necessarily have to be
Recorded in notes, you could relive it day after day,
Century after century in a series of affective rituals.
Although it is self-evident you observe that
«Things live or die» you do admit
That birth is far from painless, you
Acknowledge human helplessness before diseases
Like A.I.D.S.-the multiplicity of forms of physical
And psychological cruelty that existence confers.
Should you deny this you'll never see the space
Between the glass and the landscape outside
Which we all agree is lovely and in tremendous peril.
The rebels are taking their positions,
The old fathers are constructing weapons,
People are fearing for their lives,
Nobody can take their eyes off the facts for a moment.
Over and over again you have to teach yourself
How to breathe, how to stand and talk.
Does this sound like you?
It isn't you, in fact, even though we share
The same world, the same trees, the same room.
Sorry about the broken angel, it's no one's fault.
Sometimes the years burst their seams
And growth goes where it will. But
There must always be time for fumbling through the memorabilia
For putting some order next to the scurrying chaos
If not around it:-a "running fence."

Minneapolis evening performance residue 2/22/02:


(I performed, then Miekal And. I ran video/still images, wrote the
following text; all this was projected from a laptop - the text written
live - sometimes 2-3 videos would play at once - the text brackets the
audio-visual.)

my work's concerned with language, sexuality, the virtual body and
subjectivity - all of these elements interacting online and off -

i'm concerned with what happens beneath the surface, the coding, the
psychoanalytics, the substances

i'm concerned, i'm very concerned thank you! It's r-rated, not X-rated -
the difference I think is based on penetration? I'm not really sure...

I do codework and what might be considered virtual -body work online. For
example - sorry about the errors - they accumulate - for example the mime
piece I showed yesterday - please exit through that door over there!!!
<===== sure!!! well, we know nothing about mime. we do know that hmmm...
there are glass boxes and ropes and things and sometimes the hula =-
you've got a bit of all this here - it's like a language mapped across the
body - for that matter the hula is really an exact mapping, azure's
smoking again -

down the stairs, up the stairs, etc. etc. so this seemed a bit boring and
we sent the mimes to hell - heh heh the fire's really hot!

but the digital layer does add something else to it - a kind of sign
imposed on the body from outside - it's through the framework - it's not
present in the space we're performing in... these are darker works...
about a year ago we were at the experimental television center in owego
upstate ny and were able to create a piece i'd wanted to do for a long
time - exploring literal writing on the body - in a kind of presencing of
both sexuality and inscription - that comes next - that's here - the sound
triggers the cameras through an analog synthesizer... we write chinese
ideograms on each other - from an early period of the development of the
characters - we come together, erase them through our contact - we're
apart - we stamp each other with hanko - one at the beginning and one at
the end - I seem to be making less typing mistakes than usual for this
kind of stuff. i showed this in Buffalo and Loss Glazier thought that I
was hmmm... like it was a big movie done but you know better, Minneapolis!

anyway the ideograms are those for breath, circulation, respieration
(heh!), turning, - and above the genitals, a symbol for negation - it's
the same in contemporary Japanese - I'm in the wrong font here...

I'll skip about - to show how this works...  Azure's a lot younger than me
but we're married. we showed some images in the university in Florida and
the students thought she was my daughter... you can have absolutely no
idea what that led to.

this piece with foofwa d'imobilite also uses the five camera setup - he's
a brilliant dancer from switzerland... we did a number of works
deconstructing ballet and emphasizing both the labor and the sexuality
involved -

then of course there are the extensions of these body issues through
mathematics - but these are stationary images - we'll just use the sound -
that was a bit of a lacanian mystery with all those symbols...

but i began to get interested (I began to get interesting? Not on your
life) - I began to get int. etc. in transforming images into mathematical
functions and then modifying them through a program called Mathematica -
it produced the result you see above left but also could modify existing
digital images -

In all of them the body's surrounded by mathesis, a mathematical space
that heightens the contrasted areas... In the movie above left - those are
Azure's nipples mapped onto a mathematical framework, turned into a
three-dimensional mapping which is then deconstructed by transforming
positions and parameters... Azure stood at the end of the dance piece; it
was important that she stood - it brackets the relationship of the males
who were in a kind of competition - the fast guitar - the dahdahdah - the
dance - as if we could overpower each other - the vertical positioning
changed everything -

well, I worked through a character called Nikuko - "meat girl" in Japanese
- who started off as a snack-bar girl and ended up as a demiurge. Azure
played nikuko and I played Doctor Leopold Konninger in a series of texts,
videos, soundworks, and performances. Nikuko would pirouette for Doctor
Leopold Konninger or

anyway as you can see a lot of the work has to do with bodily abjection as
well - the relationship between the body and various forms of
discomfort...

what happens if you map flesh onto asteroids? or onto three-dimensional
space itself - creating convoluted spaces... -

all of this - this section - based on the near earth object (NEO) email
list I belong to - warning me, through NASA, of whatever asteroids are
about to hit the planet. there are also images of flybies (?) flybyes of
asteroids, al silent of course - so I worked on making them work for me...
this is part of a series of works using Nikuko and Dr LK - produced at the
same place using analog synthesizers - they were run as a series at
Millennium Film in NY - you see the references to piroettes here.. she
dances and dances for the doctor. the two of them are locked together like
gears or cams in a localized sexual economy written by george grosz -
there's no escape from it/them, from the obsessiveness -

how did we get here?  the deconstruction of the body, of inscription on or
around the body, of ballet, of writing on the body, of an incipient
sexuality, of machinery and functional gears... we could end with a couple
of things -

Miami Everglads and the welcome movie and then there was the mess of the
Everglades and the violent sexuality of Miami and its highest crime rate
in the country and the corrupt university and civic government and and and
and about Miami, as someone said, Trust me you don't want to go there

but this isn't about Miami so much as about deconstruction and the body
and inscription and sex and language and and and and and ...

just one more runthrough - the "new one" btw (by the way) refers to a
computer i got from the place to use while I was there - it's not THIS
machine - THIS machine is a lot better - I can really DREAM on this
machine - and as you see it allows a lot of movies to play at once.

testing one two three can you hear me?
testing one two three can you hear me?

I'm azure Carter's neurotic husband, welcome to -

Cyberspace (If I were Miekal I could make that really big and move all
over the page!

He is not related to Joseph Heller, though when he had a house in the
Hamptons he was often referred to as "the other Heller."

Miekal And, Azure and I, have been doing workshops and performance at the
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, thanks to Maria Damon. The events
have been incredible for us - really successful as well. For the first
time, there were no technical problems; everything worked.

I demonstrated an awk filter I use in unix and began thinking about apply-
ing it to dipthongs instead of letters, created a crashed partial coding
which couldn't be decrypted.

In Minneapolis we've been to a lot of used bookstores - bought for example
Japanese Street Slang, Tibetan-English Dictionary of Buddhist Terminology,
Hulme's Speculations, books on Nara and Katsura, Wallace's The Psychology
of the Internet, Whitehead's Process and Reality. I thought of my worst
Miami nightmares, wrote the following with the script -

Briefly. I see Susan Howe as predicating her work of an historical and to
some extent an autobiographical frame and movng from there: it is a fairly
common ploy to take a given text and so on and work through or with it: but
Howe's work transforms these potential frames or structures by combining
lyricallity with intelligence and as well as a sense of history and so on
there emerges an interesting poetic...some parts eg of "Pyhagorean Silence "
I feel could be read without any (special) knowledge even of poetry:  by the
intelligent or sensitive lay-person so to speak:someone who is alert and
intelligent.
 Of course various exegeses and "linkings" can help to intensify the
poem:but that, as always, depends where the reader wants to go. Richard.

Survival's e-news is normally sent out monthly - apologies for this
extra bulletin, which we are sending because of the extreme urgency of
events unfolding in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana.

BOTSWANA: BUSHMEN WITHOUT WATER
The Botswana government has now deliberately cut off water to Gana and
Gwi Bushman villages in the desert. In the last couple of days officials
have removed parts from the Bushmen's only pump, making it impossible
for them to get any water. They also deliberately emptied the tanks
containing their remaining water supplies. Bushmen who tried to protest
were abused.

Government officials still falsely claim that Bushmen are leaving their
homes willingly - although they admit that they want to remove all
Bushmen from their ancestral lands in the reserve. If they succeed it
will entail the destruction of the Gana and Gwi tribes who have
supported themselves on their land for 20,000 years.

PLEASE HELP!
Please send an email (with a blank subject line) protesting at this step
to as many as possible of: stsiane@gov.bw, parliament@gov.bw,

Now that we're moving away from the book itself and toward a sense of
reading... I think unless explicitly stating it out front, a reading
reducing understanding poetry (or specific poems) to autobiography is a very
bad approach, and a reading that ignores autobiography or treats it as
irrelevant for whatever reason is also suffering from unacknowledged limits.
Unless explicitly reading a poet's writing one way for a particular reason,
say Howe autobiographically to shed light on sources for her 'themes', or
non-autobiographically to really focus on her shifting of memory through
language say, then why not take both into an account of reading?  Why does
it have to be one or the other exclusively?

"We are living in a neo-golden age of poetry, we want to embrace that fact and show our support for the genre. Years ago, newspapers regularly printed poetry. We would like to reinvigorate that tradition." - Charles McGrath, editor of the NYTimes Book Review.

I wonder if the NYTimes definition of this neo-golden age will extend to the forms and places alluded to in the discussion s here of Loss' book?

Dear Reiner,

There's a point at which lack of linear-cardinal direction, want of
receiver's appropriate  technology, freezing and having to rebegin,
uncertainty of how long to wait for a link to declare itself,
illegibility because of color of print, among other things, belongs to
the avant-garde idea of no beginnings-no endings, enjoying the thrill of
uncertainty, the seduction of the untrustable, being left to decide
whether to give up or continue--all of which online art enjoys so
tremendously today that we will miss it all once  stabilization sets in
(but it never will in computer technics!). And so I thoroughly enjoyed
being buffeted about by HOPE, structural walk, the shrine, being told the
sound is invalid, Beware Your, Water Water Water, Douleur-pain, that I
can't express enough my admiration for your art. If I seem effusive, you
will have to believe me: my rhetoric is my poetry of intention.

Anyway, thank you so much for your CD, which I shall be returning to, and
congratulations for the success  which you have made of the entire
enterprise of HOPE..

We played the conhunto polka

Nat Hentoff (Village Voice)

Has the Attorney General Been Reading Franz Kafka?

Big John Wants Your Reading List

During the congressional debate on John Ashcroft's USA
Patriot Act, an American Civil Liberties Union fact
sheet on the bill's assaults on the Bill of Rights
revealed that Section 215 of the act "would grant FBI
agents across the country breathtaking authority to
obtain an order from the FISA [Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act] court . . . requiring any person or
business to produce any books, records, documents, or
items."

2/26/02 The FBI, under Attorney General John Ashcroft
and the USA Patriot Act, can order bookstores to
provide lists of books bought by people suspected of
involvement in terrorism.

This is now the law, and as I wrote last week, the
FBI, armed with a warrant or subpoena from the FISA
court, can demand from bookstores and libraries the
names of books bought or borrowed by anyone suspected
of involvement in "international terrorism" or
"clandestine activities."

Once that information is requested by the FBI, a gag
order is automatically imposed, prohibiting the
bookstore owners or librarians from disclosing to any
other person the fact that they have received an order
to produce documents.

You can't call a newspaper or a radio or television
station or your representatives in Congress. You can
call a lawyer, but since you didn't have any advance
warning that the judge was issuing the order, your
attorney can't have objected to it in court. He or she
will be hearing about it for the first time from you.

I have been told that at least three of these court
orders have been served, but that's all the
information I was given—not the names of the
bookstores or the libraries. And I can't tell you my
source.

Courts do infrequently impose gag orders preceding or
during trials, and newspapers sometimes successfully
fight them. But never in the history of the First
Amendment has any suppression of speech been so
sweeping and difficult to contest as this one by
Ashcroft.

For example, if a judge places a gag order on the
press in a case before the court, the press can print
the fact that it's been silenced, and the public will
know about it.

But now, under this provision of the USA Patriot Act,
how does one track what's going on? How many
bookstores and libraries will have their records
seized? Are any of them bookstores or libraries that
you frequent? Are these court orders part of FBI
fishing expeditions, like Ashcroft's mass roundups of
immigrants?

And if the FBI deepens its concerns about terrorist
leanings after inspecting a suspect's reading list,
how can everyone else know what books will make the
FBI worry about us?

As one First Amendment lawyer said to me, "What makes
this so chilling is that there is no input into the
process." First there is the secrecy in which the
subpoenas are obtained—with only the FBI present in
court. Then then there is the gag order commanding the
persons receiving the subpoenas to remain silent.

Has John Ashcroft been reading Franz Kafka lately?

As I often do when Americans' freedom to read is
imperiled, I called Judith Krug, director of the
Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American
Library Association. I've covered, as a reporter, many
cases of library censorship, and almost invariably,
the beleaguered librarians have already been on the
phone to Judy Krug. She is the very incarnation of the
author of the First Amendment, James Madison.

When some librarians—because of community pressure or
their own political views, right or left—have wanted
to keep books or other material from readers, Judy has
fought them. She is also the leading opponent of any
attempt to curb the use of the Internet in public
libraries.

As she has often said, "How can anyone involved with
libraries stand up and say, 'We are going to solve
problems by withholding information'?"

I called to talk with her about the FBI's new power to
force libraries to disclose the titles of books that
certain people are reading—and she, of course, knew
all about this part of the USA Patriot Act. And the
rest of it, for that matter.

She told me how any library can ask for help—without
breaking the gag order and revealing a FISA visit from
the FBI. The librarian can simply call her at the
American Library Association in Chicago and say, "I
need to talk to a lawyer," and Judy will tell her or
him how to contact a First Amendment attorney.

The reason the president and the attorney general have
so far been able to trade civil liberties for security
is they know from the polls that they can count on
extensive support. Most Americans are indeed willing
to forgo parts of the Bill of Rights for safety.

Only by getting more and more Americans to realize
that they themselves—not just noncitizens—can be
affected by these amputations of the Bill of Rights
will there be a critical mass of resistance to what
Ashcroft and Bush are doing to our liberties.

Accordingly, the press ought to awaken the citizenry
not only to the FBI's harvesting lists of what
"suspect" Americans read, but also to the judicial
silencing of bookstores and libraries that are being
compelled to betray the privacy and First Amendment
rights of readers.

I would welcome any advice from civil liberties
lawyers on ways to counter both this provision of the
USA Patriot Act and the gag order, which is the sort
of silencing you'd expect of China or Iraq. Remember
the repeated assurances by the president, the attorney
general, and the secretary of defense that any
security measures taken in the war on terrorism would
be within the bounds of the Constitution?

Whose Constitution?

George Orwell said: "If large numbers of people
believe in freedom of speech, there will be freedom of
speech even if the law forbids it. But if public
opinion is sluggish, inconvenient minorities will be
persecuted, even if laws exist to protect them."

Today, the public doesn't even know about this
provision in the strangely titled USA Patriot Act. A
lot of people are still afraid to get on a plane. Is
Ashcroft fearful that if people find out about his
interest in what they're reading, they'll be afraid to
go to libraries and bookstores—and will start asking
questions about what the hell he thinks he's doing?
And where is Congress?

      Back dropped
              blue-grey clouds
                   warm lull
            a spot of sun
   in this clearing
               of moment transferred—
   a perfectly peaceful point
           of view—

   Larry Eigner's window.
          Salute you Larry!
                  Seagull cries 3 times
              and then the crow,
      also a reef grazer,
   slowest, easiest,
           then smooth layers exhale—
   Don't let yourself get away
                   from that conversational
                tone line of  the reef emerging
            low tide, windless
                                              February 2, 1996
                                             —Joanne Kyger

She’s one of our hidden treasures — the poet who really links the Beats, the
Spicer Circle, the Bolinas poets, the New York School, and the Language
poets, and the only poet who can be said to do all of the above.
—       Ron Silliman


Our literary histories of the last quarter of the twentieth century were all
written far too soon — in fact, before the period had even been lived. When
this history is finally rewritten, as it will have to be, Joanne Kyger will
assume a central place. She is one of the finest practioners of the art of
poetry conceived (after Whitman and Williams, among others) as the
preservation of experience in language. The scale of Kyger’s poetry is human
existence; spoken language provides its measure; the animating force is
curiosity. Out of these materials she has accomplished something magnificent
and beautiful. She has many peers but no betters.

                                                — Ben Friedlander


In stressing the self as a phenomenon, as appearing, being there - Joanne
Kyger's work encourages one to move beyond the tendency to see two types of
poets (women and men), which in feminist scholarship has produced a
particular, unfavorable model of literary productions. Her work encourages
one to see women writers as gesturing outward - in the same generous sense
that Charles Olson saw Robert Creeley as a "figure of outward." This
«Jacket» feature ventures in that direction with an array of critical
readings, none of them particularly attuned to gender but all of them
responsive to the powerful insistence of Joanne Kyger's cultivated line and
ear, and the graceful persistence of a continually evolving poetic, one that
lets the self go through listening to what's there - from the intimate
notebook page and the company it keeps to larger temporalities and
geographies - to create a self, broad and sweeping.

—       Linda Russo

from JOANNE

"JOANNE is a novel from the inside out."

what I wanted to say
  was in the broad
sweeping
form of being there

 I am walking up the path
  I come home and wash my hair
 I am bereft
  I dissolve quickly

I am everybody

reprinted from Joanne, Angel Hair, 1970

THE ANGEL HAIR ANTHOLOGY

published 2001 by Granary Books

"ANGEL HAIR reaches us now from a moment in American history that is still
a part of our cultural & spiritual present. Under the care of Anne Waldman
& Lewis Warsh--young poets in what was, circa 1965, the hot center of a
"new" "American" "poetry"--their economically printed & exuberantly
disseminated magazine was a key vehicle for the innovative & groundbreaking
work of an entire generation of poets & artists. This large & generous
anthology is not only an archival masterpiece--the best of a time that's
now gone though scarce forgotten--but an incitement to keep their work aive
for a still newer generation."

Subject:      bernstein's absorption
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Reading Charles Bernstein's poem "Artifice of Absorption," I was struck by a
resemblance between his term "absorption' and the Sublime. To pick just one
point (and one version of Sublime), Bernstein writes

By absorption I mean engrossing, engulfing
completely engaging, arresting attention, reverie,
attention intensification, rhapsodic, spellbinding,
mesmerizing, hypnotic, total, riveting,
enthrallic: belief, conviction, silence

which to me serves as an introduction to his passages on Poe and Dickinson
which jibe with a remark in Longinus (chapter 7) that "by some innate power
the true sublime lifts our souls; we are filled with a proud exaltation and
a sense of vaulting joy, just as though we had ourselves produced what we
had heard." Heard, received - hearing/seeing, receptivity. Bernstein remarks
that

... In Poe's
fiction, horror is a means not only of absorbing
the reader in the tale but also, explicitly,
obliterating the self-consciousness of the story's
characters, who commonly fall into states of
absolutely rapt presentness, or rapture, or terror,
or reverie.

Bernstein then goes on to quote Dickinson's "I would not paint - a picture-"
as a "radically absorptive poetic" and writes

Not to describe or incant but to be
the thing described, "endued" - endowed - "Baloon";
to be inside, lighter than, "things,"
inflated by them, so absolutely absorbed as to be
floating "Enamored - impotent - content"; for
such enrapturement leaves one impotent to affect
the world, since to be able to affect requires
that one is removed from; & this armless
connection not only leaves one content but also, & the
double sense is crucial to the metaphysics
of the poem, makes one CONtent, thinged - bolts
one to the other side of the see/seen divide.
Yet to be able to be absorbed into this other side
requires jolts, an antiabsorptive disruption
of complacent pictoral "talk." So to "stun" is
to shock into one's senses, an ecstatic,
perhaps mystical, transport into what Howe calls
the "thrilling anonymity" of Dickinson's poetics.
Author disappears & by this act "licenses"
the "luxury" of a deeper absorption, by the reader,
in the poem than otherwise imaginable.

There are other correspondences between Bernstein's absorption and
Longinus's Sublime (which engulfs, as the Sublime is wont to do, the Burkean
and Kantian Sublimes).

Subject:      FW: Minnis & Catanzano read at CU Boulder
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

This Friday, March 1st @7:30  Old Main, University of Colorado, Boulder

The poetry of
Chelsey Minnis

and the poetry of
Amy Catanzano

Friday March 1st. @7:30
Old Main Auditorium
University of Colorado

Chelsey Minnis is winner of the 2001 Alberta Prize from Fence
Books with her book Zirconia.  Minnis is a graduate of the Iowa Writers
Workshop, where she was a Teaching-Writing Fellow. Her work has appeared in
Caliban, OntheBus, Faucheuse, The Portlander, Cream City Review, Jacaranda,
Seneca Review, Provincetown Arts, Silverfish Review, Two Girls Review,
Chicago Review, Kenning, and others. Minnis was a winner and featured reader
at the Portland, Oregon Artquake Literary Festival.

Winner of the 2001 Alberta Prize Zirconia's laconic visionary is detached,
but alive to the poignancy of detachment, and through the "silver lips of a
feverish child" invites connectivity by means of tenderness and brutality.


Amy Catanzano's poems have appeared or are forthcoming in American Letters &
Commentary, Aufgabe, Columbia Poetry Review, Conjunctions, Web Conjunctions,
Facture, Greyrock Review, Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies and VOLT.  She
received her M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where she was
the recipient of a Maytag Fellowship and a teaching appointment in
Literature.  She received her B.A. in English from Colorado State
University.  She grew up in Boulder and has taught English at the University
of Iowa and at Metropolitan State College of Denver. She currently works in
fundraising as a research analyst for the University of Colorado Foundation.

MYUNG MI KIM & GEOFFREY G. O'BRIEN

@The Poetry Center, SFSU, Humanities 512

MYUNG MI KIM is Professor of Creative Writing at San Francisco State
University. Her three previous books of poetry are Under Flag, winner of
the 1991 Multicultural Publishers Book Award, The Bounty (1996), and Dura
(1998). Myung Mi Kim reads from Commons, her newest volume, out from UC
Press. Myung Mi Kim's Commons
weighs on the most sensitive of scales the minute grains of daily life in
both peace and war, registering as very few works of literature have done
our common burden of being subject to history. Abstracting colonization,
war, immigration, disease, and first-language loss until only sparse
phrases remain, Kim takes on the anguish and
displacement of those whose lives are embedded in history.

"The poems in Commons are at once global and intensely personal and
emotional. An immensely talented poet, Myung Mi Kim loves language - its
internal rhymes, alliterations, and diverse rhythms. Caught off guard by
the beauty and precision of Kim's language and the exquisite images she so
deftly conjures, we are drawn unwittingly into a web of fragmentary
memories that subvert what we think we know about the violent history that
haunts her and never ceases to demand recognition."-Elaine Kim

GEOFFREY G. O'BRIEN's poetry has appeared in many journals, including
American Letter & Commentary, The American Poetry Review, Boston Review,
Denver Quarterly, Fence, The Iowa Review, and Volt. Obsessed with work and
dream, shot through with weather and color, Geoffrey G. O'Brien's spirited
debut, The Guns and Flags Project, pursues the possibility of the lyric
itself-whether the voice raised "with melodies/and thinking" can be rescued
from the ongoing disaster of progress. In roving five-beat lines the poems
pass again and again through scenes of liminality-sunset and dawn, falling
asleep and waking up, border crossings-searching there for a potential
ethics and politics of vision, a mutating, rhythmic "project" to oppose the
inert spectacle of guns and flags. Like Ashbery stoked on sonics, O'Brien
insists that the restless, unsatisfied motion of thought must hold the
place for an ever-decaying
freedom within the state.
