	RITUALS


	    1

	In this now ancient ritual
	a succession of young women

	are saucy,

	which is to say they name
	common objects and relations

	as if they had mastered them
	but shouldn't.

	Each receives false approbation.


	     2

	As Xmas sells winter
	to its prisoners.

	As warmth
	feels like love;

	and love is warmth
	only more capricious.

	Fingers uncurl.

	Organs expand
	and rise

	toward a surface
	that must never

	be broken.

Just Saying, Rae Armantrout's most recent book of poems, was published by
Wesleyan University Press in 2013. Versed (Wesleyan, 2009) received the
Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was also a
finalist for the National Book Award. Next Life (Wesleyan, 2007) was
chosen as one of the 100 Notable Books of 2007 by The New York Times.
Other recent books include Money Shot (Wesleyan, 2011), Collected Prose
(Singing Horse, 2007), Up to Speed (Wesleyan, 2004), The Pretext (Green
Integer, 2001), and Veil: New and Selected Poems (Wesleyan University
Press, 2001). Her poems have been included in anthologies such as The Best
of the Best American Poetry: 1988-2012 (2013), The Norton Anthology of
Postmodern American Poetry (2013), The Open Door: 100 Poems, 100 Years of
Poetry Magazine (Chicago, 2012), American Hybrid (Norton, 2009), American
Women Poets in the 21 Century: Where Language Meets the Lyric Traditionist
(Wesleyan, 2002), The Oxford Book of American Poetry (Oxford, 2006) and
The Best American Poetry of 1988, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2011 and
2012. Armantrout received an award in poetry from the Foundation for
Contemporary Arts in 2007 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008. She is
Professor of Poetry and Poetics at the University of California, San
Diego. Writing in Poetry magazine, Ange Mlinko has said, "I would trade the
bulk of contemporary anecdotal free verse for more incisive, chilling
poetry like Armantrout's."

This is Armantrout's second above/ground press publication, after the
chapbook Custom (2012).

Friends and colleagues,

We hope you can join us as Furniture Press Books visits Pace University on
their nationwide tour to read from new work. You can attend this event
online or on the Pace campus.

The Furniture Press authors will read on campus in Pleasantville in the
Choate House Dining Room Tuesday October 1st at 3:30. We will broadcast the
event through Blackboard Collaborate (hyperlink and instructions below)

Furniture Press Books publishes limited runs of handmade, hand-printed
chap/books, pamphlets and zines (anywhere from 50 to 200), plus full-length
books and collections. Furniture Press Books believes in active
participation and collaboration in the community. Their books reach into
the physical environment: they hold readings and events throughout the
year, and promote their catalog throughout the country; they hold a
month-long poetry festival in April (Cruellest Month Poetry & Performance
Festival), inviting literary organizations to host the best of their talent
and introduce new voices to new audiences; they work closely with the
residents and businesses of Baltimore County and City by investing revenue
and energy to increase patronage and exposure; and they collaborate with
the Poetry in Community, a non-profit organization that is central to the
creative lives of the region=92s residents, students and businesses.

Readers for the event include:

Martine Bellen

Iris Marble Cushing

Ryan Eckes

Alyse Knorr

Magus Magnus

Deborah Poe

Alicia Puglionesi

offer inexpensive workshops and free programs in our local public =
schools. We are pretty great. And we need your support!

Our Indiegogo campaign will underwrite residencies for FOUR deserving =
artists in 2014. An amazing opportunity for four people to develop their =
work in a way that could not happen otherwise.

BR3: For Kurt on His 37th Birthday
At 2:06 a.m. on Feb. 17, 2004 I emailed 51 poets asking them for
Nirvana acrostics by 3 p.m. that same day, three days before what
would have been Kurt Cobain's 37th birthday and a live performance of
Nirvana's In Utero Boog was putting on. These 13 writers met the call:

Todd Colby, Sean Cole, Shanna Compton, Jordan Davis, Erica Kaufman,
Aaron Kiely, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Tony Rubin, Alan Semerdjian,
Jill Stengel, Edwin Torres, Dana Ward, Ian Wilder, and Stephanie Young.

hi friends,

I have a record coming out - poetry/jazz/klezmer/improvisation, it's called
"Hermeneutic Stomp" (Blue Thread Records, 2013). We're celebrating the
release with a concert at Cornelia Street Cafe in NY on Oct 14 at 8.30pm,
and everyone is very much invited! If anyone's interested in reviewing the
album, please drop me a note. More info about the approach is on Jacket2:
http://jacket2.org/commentary/improvised-poetry-palimpsest-drafts.

More info about the "Hermeneutic Stomp" and the release party here:

all best
jake

I'd like to note that back in March, in a post decrying the relentless =
gentrification of San Francisco, I posed a question about which team to =
ethically root for this year, which concluded with the question =
"Cleveland?" That question has now been answered.

The Poetry (-/+ Critical) Playlist Symposium
November 1, 2013, 2 p.m. - 5 p.m.

The Humanities Center, University of Pittsburgh
Cathedral of Learning, Room 602
4200 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA
Open to the Public

Speakers: Terrance Hayes (University of Pittsburgh), Lynn Keller
(University of Wisconsin), Dawn Lundy Martin (University of Pittsburgh),
Christopher Nealon (Johns Hopkins University), Brian M. Reed (University of
Washington)

During the symposium, panelists will perform short readings of
texts--poems, essays, pop songs, videos--that they have recently had on
'repeat.' These readings will be open-ended and partial, foregrounding
questions and sticking points to encourage audience members to contribute.
These readings, combined, will make up a kind of 'playlist' or 'mixtape,'
where one text will take on added meaning in juxtaposition with the others.
The audience and group as a whole will then have a chance to comment on the
nature of our encounters with these texts: how are we reading them, and
why? The structure of the event will serve to emphasize the validity and
explorability of the reader's/listener's engagements--the ways that we, as
readers, in our engagements, make texts open up off the page, into our
lives, and onto our conditions of life.

Dear all,

I hope you'll join us at the Zinc bar this Saturday 10/05 at 4:30 for
the launch
of the Fall season of Segue<https://www.facebook.com/events/329632937181897=

featuring

ZEYAR LYNN

Zeyar Lynn is the pseudonym of Myint Aung, born in Yangon in 1958, In 1978
he published 3 chapbooks of poems at the risk of imprisonment (not so much
for writing poems as for publishing illegally without passing through the
proper channels of the scrutiny board). From 1992 to 1993, heFrom 1992 to
1993, he co-edited the avant garde literary magazine =91The Sea=92, but
unfortunately, only 3 issues were published after which the magazine had to
be closed down due to censor board harassment. Currently, he is co-editing
=91Kabyar Lawka/Poetry World=92, a quarterly poetry magazine, which aims to
become the first ever poetry magazine in Myanmar, if and when the
government permits. He is also a regular contributor to the various
magazines in Myanmar, which feature his poems, articles, and translations.
His poems have been translated into English and published in Bones Will
Crow: 15 Burmese Contemporary Poets, translated and edited by ko ko thett &
James Byrne, Arc Publications, UK, 2012.

RACHEL BLAU DUPLESSIS

Rachel Blau DuPlessis is known as a poet and essayist, and as a critic and
scholar with a special interest in modern and contemporary poetry. From
1986 until 2012, DuPlessis has been engaged in a long poem project,
collected in several book-length installments from Wesleyan University
Press and Salt Publishing. The most recent installment, Surge: Drafts
96-114 was published by Surge (2013), bringing this 26 year-long poem to a
temporary fold. Her recent Purple Passages: Pound, Eliot, Zukofsky, Olson,
Creeley and the Ends of Patriarchal Poetry (University of Iowa Press, 2012)
is part of a feminist trilogy of works about gender and poetics that
includes The Pink Guitar: Writing as Feminist Practice and Blue Studios:
Poetry and its Cultural Work, both from University of Alabama Press.
Another key critical book by DuPlessis is Genders, Races, and Religious
Cultures in Modern American Poetry, 1908-1934 (Cambridge University Press,
2001).


Season curated by Genji Amino and Daisy Atterbury.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi all--

My new book, /White Noise/, was released this past month by Apostrophe
Books.  Please email me backchannel if you're interested in a review
copy (tony at starve.org):

http://www.amazon.com/White-Noise-Tony-Trigilio/dp/0979362768/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1380833598&sr=1-1&keywords=tony+trigilio+white+noise

It's a collage and appropriation extravaganza.  From the publisher's
statement:

"Trigilio's /White Noise/ blends the political and the personal in an
unsettling amalgam of prose fragments that have been disassembled and
reassembled through a variety of strategies that are almost Oulipian in
their peculiar constraints and methodology. From a unique deformation of
Don DeLillo's /White Noise/ to a collocation of speech culled from
Usenet bulletin boards to scattered material originally posted on the
web, Trigilio stitches, reassembles and re-weaves the rhetoric of fear
and politics with the language of literature and personal narrative. The
book examines the poignant and disturbing intersection between the
underground Usenet forums existing before 9/11 and post 9/11 terroristic
paranoia. Trigilio reveals that everything these forum-users were
paranoid about since the Cold War has, in a sense, come true. This
dystopian vision is becoming an increasing reality, Trigilio shows,
because we have openly accepted this bizarre and chilling world of kill
lists and mass surveillance. /White Noise /is a quintessentially
pataphysical response to our current milieu, but it is also, ironically,
approached in utterly realist terms."

Best,
Tony

Dear Friends,

My apologies for the mass mail. I just wanted to send a quick personal
email making sure you knew about PAGE TURNER: The AAWW Food & Books
Festival<http://www.pageturnerfest.org/>,
this Saturday, October 5th at Roulette and the YWCA in Downtown Brooklyn.

Half kid-friendly indoor street fair, half cultural happening, this free
festival is possibly the most ambitious thing that AAWW has ever done.
We'll have all-day dumpling-making sessions and a whole floor of food
venders, like Bombay Sandwich Shop, Brooklyn Soda Works, and Big Bao. Our
line-up includes more than 80 writers, intellectuals, and artists,
including winners of the Pulitzer, Tony and Guggenheim, and artists who're
in the Met and MOMA. We have over 1000 RSVPs!

We'll have interactive workshops like origami folding and butterfly-making.
An NPR show will do live recordings. There will be live dancers. Sound
installations. A food-related performance piece. A class on how to write
comics by an X-men writer. A pop-up poster gallery. Tarot card readings
with a well-known novelist. Free posters. Even a guy in a big dumpling
suit. The festival site is at http://www.pageturnerfest.org--it's really
beautiful, so I hope you can take a look at it.

Warmly,
Ken Chen
Executive Director, AAWW

*1. Your stomach will love you for the rest of your life.* We'll have a
whole gallery of food venders including Bombay Sandwich Shop, Big Bao,
Brooklyn Soda Works, Granola Lab, and Parantha Alley. And dumpling-making.

*2. After a long week at work, don't you want to play?* We're going to have
stations where you can (yes) make your own dumplings, learn how to write a
graphic novel, or learn how to write a poem--or just get one written for
you. Origami. Poster-making. You can even bring your kids.

*3. Your brain will explode from the sheer awesomeness. In a good way.*Our
line-up includes almost 80 writers, activists and artists over four
spaces--like David Henry Hwang, Colorlines publisher Rinku Sen, Rumpus
Founder Stephen Elliott, Monica Youn, Monique Truong, Mei-mei
Berssenbrugge, Sergio de la Pava, Ayad Akhtar, Justin Torres, and Madiha
Tahir, who's been interviewing drone attack survivors in Pakistan. And a
guy dressed as a giant
bao.<http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=3D001Ox55p9AClxH0zuTLT7GyBkEgelzY_kH0oZE2y=

Beginner's Mind was begun in the middle of May, 2013, with the idea of a
monthly blog of my written and photographed monologues on and with the
land near where I live. The months have evolved into seasons, and the
blog format---with its links to other blogs--is now only the
Introduction: http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Begin/Intro.htm

I've thought a lot about the subtitle, finally settling on "Toward an
Ecohumanities," as what I want to explore are possible, or impossible,
human relationships with the nonhuman. This is because these
relationships are essential to our species surviving in, and beyond,
this century. Of course, mine is just one contribution in a vast network
of explorations and creativities, but I hope that within the
constriction of its landscape may be glimpsed a few paths that inspire
some viable possibilities.

Beginner's Mind is uploaded all during the course of its writing and
revisions. Then a notice, such as this one, is sent at the end of each
season. Since the last notice, it has been redesigned, partly revised,
and Summer 2013 has been completed:
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Begin/Summer%202013.htm

Feedback is always appreciated.

Happy Autumn!
-Joel

Lew Welch's "Ring of Bone: Collected Poems," a
book that I think, since we are quickly moving into an interconnected
wealth of cultures, is important to Global Literary History. This is
because, I suggest, Welch's life and work is representative of the
kind of hard-won accomplishment in the arts that we are unfortunately
losing to the valorization of instant, and shallow, celebrity.
Also, because of his intimate relationship with the natural world, it is
instructive to the field of ecopoetics:

Fourth Annual Charles Olson Lecture
October 19, 2013 Cape Ann Museum 1:00 Call for reservations =96 978- 283-04=
55
Introduction by Ammiel Alcalay

Amiri Baraka will speak generally on Charles Olson's effect on him as poet
& specifically from an essay called  "Charles Olson & Sun Ra: A Note on
Being Out "

=93I leave space open as the term should be, to fill what you want to fill =
it
with.=94

Sun Ra - Space is the Place.

"My shift is that I take it the present is prologue, not the past. The
instant, therefore, is its own interpretation, as a dream is, and any
action - a poem, for example. Down with causation . . . And yrself: you, as
the only reader and mover of the instant. You, the cause.
No drag allowed, on either. Get on with it."

Charles Olson - The Present is Prologue

Dear friends and supporters of ON Contemporary Practice,

As you know, Michael Cross and I are currently in the process of
re-launching ON, both as an online journal and a perfect-bound
monograph series. We are very excited that next month Robert Kocik's
long-awaited prose collection, Supple Science: a Robert Kocik Primer,
will be available for purchase. To read more about the book, which
also features essays by Silvia Federici, Madeline Gins, Rob Halpern,
Andrew Levy, Eleni Stecopoulos and myself, please visit ON's website
-
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?YourCompanyName/2bde7156b1/126f8552d1/80fec0b273 .

Not yet having had the time or wherewithal to pursue fundraising for
the Monograph Series--a necessary endeavor for most any press large
or small nowadays--we hope to support the first batch of Supple
Science via pre-order. These are purchases made well in advance of
the book becoming officially available. With this particular
pre-order, you will receive a special insert with an original drawing
by Kocik.

By this Friday, October 11th, we would like to have no less than 90
additional pre-orders. If you intend to purchase the book, we would
appreciate your support at this moment, before we make our final push
towards printing. You can find a link to the pre-order form here -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?YourCompanyName/2bde7156b1/126f8552d1/3da8cd0510/cm=

24e9b61f737ba21b08198c3bf94e94910b985bd4617670ff63b3b .

For those who have already pre-ordered, THANK YOU SO MUCH! And for
those considering pre-ordering, we would be so appreciative if you
would take the time to support the book and the press as it attempts
to regain momentum.

In solidarity and with immense gratitude,

Thom Donovan

*The New Pratt MFA in Writing*
> *
> Now Accepting Applications for Fall 2014!*
>
> The Pratt MFA in Writing <http://prattwritingmfa.org/> is a new and
> unique two-year creative writing program specifically designed to
> support and encourage intellectually rigorous and inspired writing
> practices that are philosophically, culturally and politically informed.
>
> *Weekly collective interdisciplinary critiques inclusive of all
> students, faculty, and guest faculty.*
>
> The premise of the program is that writing can be transformative at
> all scales, from the personal to the social, and we aim to incubate
> such radically cosmopolitan, resolutely local, pleasure-filled, and
> potentially revolutionary poetic practices.
> *
> Radical and non-hierarchical pedagogy. Students and faculty
> collaborate on administrative decisions*
>
> Our innovative approach to the MFA curriculum
> <http://prattwritingmfa.org/course-of-study/> emphasizes
> interdisciplinary group critiques (with core faculty, guest artists
> and peers engaging in weekly discussions and presentations of student
> work) and it aims to provide contemporary writers the tools and the
> support they need to build a practice that is responsive and adaptive
> (and even a form of resistance) to our rapidly evolving environmental
> and political times and to the enormous shifts taking place in media
> technologies.
>
> *Fieldwork Residencies in a wide array of occupational domains that
> focus on social and environmental justice, media interventions,
> science, health and human services, animal rights, and local and
> global activism.*
>
> Our core faculty <http://prattwritingmfa.org/core-faculty/> of writers
> is diverse and internationally renowned. Their work traverses and
> often combines numerous genres and disciplines. They are committed to
> postcolonial and reparative practices, anti-racist activism,
> environmental justice, as well as the promotion of gender equality and
> economic justice.

The State In Which
Hailey Higdon
$4

	March

	The damn directions--the fact of hills, curves, can't quite be
	mapped. In the blackest minutes I grow more sterile while everyone
	else is starting to wake up, shaking branches, bugs stick. If this
	were a situation with a hostage the police would be pointing their
	guns giving the motion calm down without the action to accompany it.
	There is a wild rose called lady banks which opens colors patchy but
	explicit on the fences around.

	I woke up to a mirror. It was already March, things were in bloom,
	I could hear them. I wanted their motion to be bidirectional to me
	just like when someone says happy birthday to me my instinct is to
	always want it to be bidirectional, to say, Happy birthday to you too!

	My professor would call me one of the late bloomers and not because
	of my small boobs because making progress in a human takes longer
	than a season. Sometimes producing the overall sound of excitement
	involves periods of bootless duty to the idea of mortality.

	I'll stop there and describe my reflection. Wake up, it says.

Hey everyone,

In 2008, as part of our Boog City=92s Classic Albums Live series, we =20
held our second You Make the Call night, where past classic album =20
performers selected what albums we'd perform next. The two top vote =20
getters were David Bowie, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the =20=

Spiders of Mars and Radiohead, OK Computer.

Here is Ziggy Stardust performed live by:

=97The Passenger Pigeons
=97So L=92il
=97Randi Russo
=97The Rabbits
=97Todd Carlstrom and The Clamour

To hear their take, visit:

http://www.boogcity.com/audio/bowie_ziggy.pdf

We'll have OK Computer up shortly.

And to hear Lou Reed's New York album performed live at Sidewalk Cafe =20=

a few months later, visit:

as ever,

An Overture in the Key of F
Carrie Olivia Adams
$4

   To hold in trust. It is intimate and financial. Between fidelity and
   fudicial is a nervous, fussy movement of your hands and a coined error.
   Field quickly becomes battle, which is not something my mother told me
   when we moved to the farm. The visible space, the space on which something
   is drawn or projected, the place where this information goes. Your
   fidgeting mitt, youre ready to field it.

   A day of maneuvers and a day of pleasure. This demon, addict, excessive
   fiend. Given to fighting, to flame. Once I was fifteen, like all of you, a
   similar coupling between tractor and trail, burdensome trifle, an often
   repetitive pattern, a series of movements in name only.

   Made incandescent by the passage of an electrical currentto feed, satiate,
   make out, make wholeto fill those shoes, I cannot go back. On the course,
   by the wind, the fillip of your thumb. Filmland and filmdom, both gauzy in
   my sleep, corrupts.

RAYMOND DEANE'S NOCTUARY

On 22 September 2013, =93NOCTUARY,=94 by the Irish poet, novelist, and comp=
oser
Raymond Deane, had its world premiere at the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin,
Ireland.  =93NOCTUARY=94 is a 45 minute cycle of 12 pieces for piano, etc.,
commissioned by Hugh Tinney with funds from the Arts Council of Ireland/An
Chomairle Eala=EDon.  Hugh Tinney is one of the leading concert pianists in
Ireland today.

http://www.raymonddeane.com

Now an effort is being made for ordinary people, grassroots people,
rank-and-file people, to fund a CD recording of this work through FUNDIT.IE=
...

http://www.fundit.ie/project/noctuary-deanetinney-piano-music-cd

https://www.facebook.com/noctuary1

A NOCTUARY is a nighttime diary, and these pieces by Raymond Deane evoke
many and various images of the night, including Minerva's owl (which =93tak=
es
flight as twilight falls=94), the Versipel (a creature that turns its skin
inside out, like a werewolf), the Mezzotint (from a famous ghost story by
M.R. James), the =93hitherandthithering waters of night=94 from James Joyce=
's
Finnegans Wake, and the =93night-blooming Cereus=94 (a cactus that supposed=
ly
flowers on only one night of the year).

Raymond Deane is the DEAN of living (and innovative) Irish composers today.
 In January of this year he turned 60 and a number of events celebrating
this occasion have taken place (or are still to take place) throughout
Ireland, including concerts, seminars, and the premiere of his opera =93The
Alma Fetish=94 in Dublin's National Concert Hall.

=93NOCTUARY=94 by Raymond Deane, please do so at ...

Hi all,

I wanted to announce to everyone a mid-term festival to go along with =20=

Mon. Feb. 17, 2014, 12:00 p.m.-3:30 p.m.

The event will feature poetry, music, political talks, and poets =20
theater.

Unlike the past few WBC's, where we only invited folks new to the =20
festival, we'll be inviting some previous participants to once again =20
take part, excluding those who've performed at the last two festivals.

--------------------------------------------------

And one month earlier, come out for=97

Book Launch & Reception: EYE OF WITNESS: A JEROME ROTHENBERG READER
Sunday, October 27 at 3:00pm in EDT
Page 22: 435 West 22nd Street, 2nd Floor

In addition to which Diane Rothenberg and I will be in New York again =
for most of the stretch from October 20 through November 9, staying as =
before at the Lee Ann Brown and Tony Torn residence at 435 West 22nd =
Street in Chelsea.  Times away from New York are for a reading/launch at =
Tufts University on October 24, a "Transatlantic Poetry Summit" (Spanish =
& English conference & readings) also at Tufts on October 25, and two =
readings/talks in Ottawa (University of Ottawa November 4 at 4:00 p.m. =
and A B Series November 5 at 8:00 p.m.).  During that time we'll be =
reachable, as always, at this email address and on our cell phone =
numbers: 760-415-9889 and 760-415-1430.

In the hopes of seeing some of you then,
& with warm embraces,

JERRY and DIANE

P.S. Eye of Witness is a 600 page reader of my work in a mix of forms & =
genres - poems, essays & commentaries, plays & performances, letters, =
visuals - arranged in a format similar to anthologies of mine like =
Technicians of the Sacred and Poems for the Millennium.  So the party & =
reading will cover a range of works, but the event will be, above all, a =
chance to meet with friends and help us celebrate the occasion.

This 17th Poetica critique is of Margaret Chula's "Just This," a
collection of tanka poems.

Basically, tanka is the modern name for waka, a form of writing that
stems back to Japan's Heian Period (794-1185).
As opposed to haiku, usually written in three lines (in Japanese, they
are in one line), tanka has five lines.

Chula spent 12 years in Japan studying various Japanese arts.
Her first book, "Grinding My Ink," a collection of haiku, won the 1992
Haiku Society of America's Merit Award.

"Just This" her seventh book, is a masterful work in this constricted
format.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Dear Everybody,

I'm excited to unveil a leaked video of Rauan Klassnik taking a bath. The
footage includes erotic toe shots, poems once lodged now dripping from a
pink wig, and huge, excessive blown bubbles filled with cow bones and
baseball cap sweat; a burial undone:

https://vimeo.com/77223793

Please feel free to spread this video like Gucci's Bird Flu (embed it, link
to it, whatever). If your uncle doesn't care for poetry or YouTube, he will
now. Any complaints from clergy or networks or hiring committees can be
addressed directly to Rauan at:kenrusellisnotmydaddy@gmail.com

Please help to keep The Continental Review forever circulating!

Best,

J

Hi, everybody. Does anyone know of a professor teaching a course involving
avant-garde poetry or fiction, concrete poetry, or immigrant writers, who
might be interested in a guest lecture on the works of Robert Zend? I just
gave a seminar (with lots of images and a couple of videos) at the
University at Buffalo's Poetry Collection that was well-received, and I'd
love to find other venues for such a talk.

If interested, please backchannel: rogueembryo@gmail.com

Many thanks.

Cheers!

MIME-Version: 1.0

Neo-baroque? Conversationalism? The Padilla Affair? Echoes of Baudelaire
and Whitman? Before reading The Whole Island, I knew almost nothing about
Cuban poetry.

Now I understand something of its rich and complex history. And I *know*
which Cuban poets I want to read more of.

I review Mark Weiss's anthology here:

Here's a link to the Youtube rendition of Poetic Fictions at the
Sidewalk Cafe the night of Sunday, Aug. 4th, 2013.  The saintly David
Kirschenbaum did the cinematography, poet Robert Thompson was the
moderator, poet Joe Eliot did a great Philip Whalen, the poet/roustabout
Magnus Magnus was the vatic Lew Welch and Mark Tobin of Unnameable Books
played a stand-up Gary Snyder.  I stepped in as my perpetually
jet-lagged self.

Variations of the text of Poetic Fictions can be found in TWO, a chapbook
from The KNIVESFORKSANDSPOONSPRESS, UK, and in Golden Handcuffs Review
No. 15.  Many thanks to everyone who made this happen--Boog City's Dave
Kirschenbaum,The Sidewalk Cafe, The Hotel Pennsylvania, the Tic-Tock 24
hour diner, the Empire State Building at 3 a.m., Madison Square Garden
at 3 a.m., Robert Thompson and Joe Eliot at 3 a.m., and peace to the
shade of Lew Welch who shook my world at 19 when he said that writing is
speech, David Meltzer who brought that information to me in his great
interview in his great anthology of San Fran poets, Philip Whalen's
shadow walking in spectral shoes with Taoist holes pecked in them by Zen
birds, and Gary Snyder young and old and in-between.

We have been asked to share the following announcement with the Poetics
list.

* * *

Dear Citizens:

Please subscribe to a new series of poetry pamphlets, published by SHIT
VALLEY, a new press collective out of Cambridge that has no budget and is
devoted to publishing with urgency, thrift, and careful ease. Here is what
we do. We make photocopied, large-format pamphlets, between 32 and 36
pages, in editions of unspeakable quantity, with font-sizes between 14 and
20 if possible, or shit come to think of it even larger, I mean we have
used some seriously large-ass font-sizes, ahem, and proceeds go into
printing more books.

A subscription for =A38, =8016, or $24 (postage include) will get you four
pamphlets by: Christina Chalmers, John DeWitt, Corina Copp, and Ed Luker.
The Chalmers is printed up and ready to distribute now; the others can be
expected before or around the turn of the new year.

Go to: http://shitvalley.tumblr.com/

=95 Christina Chalmers' *Work Songs* is a collection of twelve poems and
sequences, including the whole of "hell, realism", which appeared in the
latest Claudius App. It is available now as a single purchase, for =A32.50,
=805, or $8. (see website)

=95 John DeWitt's SV will be his second book under his own name, and includ=
es
several long poems plus translations of a sequence by Uruguyan poet
Idea Vilari=F1o (1920-2009).

=95 Corina Copp's SV will be two long poems, "Tell That to the Marines" and
"Engulfs".

=95 Ed Luker's *It's not you it's me. It's not you it's the cops. *collects
what appear to be all of his poems to date, including the legendary
pre-crisis fragment, "UNPRIG (Aufgegeben)".

Kenning Editions <http://www.kenningeditions.com> is proud to announce
the publication of /The Compleat Purge/, by Trisha Low. ISBN:
9780984647552 (2013) $15.95 in paperback and somewhat less as an ebook.
Through November 1st, the paperback book is on sale for $12.00 when you
order directly from the press
<http://www.kenningeditions.com/shop/the-compleat-purge/>.

Trisha Low is just another feminist, confessional writer trying to find
a good way to deal with all her literary dads. She siphons the remix
culture of social media into the binge and purge cycle of an engrossing
read, with the emphasis on gross. She reads the diaries of teenage
girls, their blog comments and love letters; she dresses like one in
performance then throws up fake blood on herself. She once surveyed the
reactions of Catholic fathers to scripted confessionals she made
regarding rough sex with men, secretly recorded the conversations, and
transcribed the tapes. The results were anthologized by a major
university press. Her first book, THE COMPLEAT PURGE, consists of the
last will and testament of one Trisha Low, who seems to commit suicide
annually; the legal documents accumulate into a coming of age story. It
goes on to chronicle the sexual fantasies of indie rock fangirls, who
may or may not be exorcising the effects of abuse through their blithe
avatars (the guy from The Strokes, etc.). Then Trisha Low finds herself
trapped in an 18th century romance novel in the most punishing way, but
for whom---we're not really sure. "How is Poetry complicit in the urge
to falsely 'heal' societal wounds into the silent fixity of It Gets
Better? What better place to look than the teen girl, whose cut wrist is
an abject fuck-you; whose cute Band-Aid and its artificial 'healing' is
really just your sentimental fantasy."

Trisha Low is committed to wearing a shock collar because she has so
many feelings. Remote controls are available at Gauss PDF, /Against
Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing/, TROLL THREAD and
others. She lives in New York City.

  Barbara Browning: Trisha Low's been leaving us periodic notes about
what we can keep of hers if she should happen to go off the deep end.
She's also been leaving us her email password, her ATM PIN code, and an
astonishing amalgamation of amatory fiction, IMs, craft patterns, magic
spells, and film noir in which every romantic interest is a MacGuffin.
Low says her virtuosic appropriations owe less to conceptual poetics
than to her adolescent days of punk vandalism. Never mind if this booty
was shoplifted---it's stunning, and I promise, you'll want to keep
everything she gives you.

J. Gordon Faylor: Trisha Low is always dying. Age, place, fictional
rendering---all are subsumed to an origin already negated. She and her
doubles evacuate with unmoving horror their teenage mania, displacing
it, emptying the identities about whom its despair circulates. Once,
maybe, this Trisha Low generated bodily heat, ate breakfast, loved and
desired. No more. /The Compleat Purge/ razes its confessional charms
like effigies, foreclosing Low's final vixi to her own secrets before
they too are obliterated in time immemorial. "He had gone from her
sight, he had not lifted his bowed head, he had not looked back."

Kim Rosenfield: Like hands reaching out from the grave in the final
scene of Brian Di Palma's /Carrie/, Trisha Low's /The Compleat Purge/
reaches out to beg the question: "what's happened to the real Trisha?"
In Low's epically eloquent new book, she hands us the keys to a crypt
wherein identity is theorized as an act of para-suicide and girlhood a
version of being buried alive. /The Compleat Purge/ reframes Freud's
infamous query: "What do women want?" by breathing new life into
shifting ideals of feminine identity, sexuality, and erotics before the
culturally determined ones land us in a coma.

Sianne Ngai: In this darkly girlish feat of self-on-self drag, Trisha
Low counters the more ascetic mode of conceptualism with a corpus of
gestures---some joyful, some painful---that turn the mass-mediated young
female body inside out, then outside once again. Her sharp intelligence
and exuberantly vandalistic spirit leap out on every page.

Subject:      Chaudiere Books: our rebuilding year,

Since Ottawa literary publisher Chaudiere Books was founded by Jennifer
Mulligan and rob mclennan in 2006 the press has produced an impressive
thirteen titles of poetry and fiction (including a couple of anthologies)
by writers both emerging and established. Originally founded in part to
advocate for the enormous amount of literary activity around Ottawa,
Chaudiere has produced single-author titles by a number of locally-based
writers including Nicholas Lea, John Newlove, Anne Le Dressay, Monty Reid,
Pearl Pirie, Marcus McCann, and Clare Latremouille. Attempting to engage
Ottawa writers in a conversation with writers across Canada, the press has
also produced works by Meghan Jackson, Michael Bryson, and Joe Blades.
Unfortunately, due to a series of life events and sundry other things, the
press has been unable to keep to a regular schedule since 2010.

Co-founder Jennifer Mulligan officially left the press earlier this year
to focus on her work in film and Ottawa poet, designer, and book
conservator Christine McNair has stepped in to fill the role of
co-publisher. With the assistance of Monique Desnoyers (web designer) and
Stephen Brockwell (sage advice); we've been enormously busy over the past
few months (apart from the fact that McNair and mclennan are expecting a
child any day now) working towards a return to a proper publishing
schedule, beginning with the publication of our first new title in December.

This is a rebuilding year for Chaudiere Books, and we will be announcing
an Indiegogo Campaign in January 2014 which will feature a whole slew of
incentives from our backlist; new and old limited edition rarities from
writers both new and established; and a few surprises. The campaign will
coincide with announcements of forthcoming titles and launches in 2014.

The first title of the official Chaudiere Books re-launch is Ground Rules:
the best of the second decade of above/ground press 2003-2013, edited by
rob mclennan with an introduction by Gil McElroy. In many ways, Chaudiere
Books has always been the trade extension of the chapbook publisher
above/ground press and this title cements and even clarifies the
associations between the two presses.

Ground Rules features writing from the second decade of one of the most
active micro publishers in Canada, selected from a series of hundreds of
publications lovingly edited, produced and distributed by editor/publisher
rob mclennan. A follow-up to Groundswell: best of above/ground press,
1993-2003 (Broken Jaw Press, 2003), Ground Rules includes a wide range of
work by poets Artie Gold, Mark Cochrane, Suzanne Zelazo, derek beaulieu,
Stephanie Bolster, Amanda Earl, Nathanael, Lisa Samuels, Rachel Zolf,
Sharon Harris, D. G. Jones, Julia Williams, Eric Folsom, Gregory Betts,
Natalie Simpson, Monty Reid, William Hawkins, Emily Carr, Cameron Anstee,
Helen Hajnoczky, Marilyn Irwin, Stephen Brockwell, Robert Kroetsch and rob
mclennan.

  Working out of Ottawa, poet and publisher rob mclennan's baby,
  above/ground press, marks a second decade of the production of
  broadsheets, chapbooks, magazines, and anthologies that trace out the best
  shapes of the best of contemporary Canadian (and, increasingly,
  international) poetry. From the span of that second ten of years, he has
  compiled this book of traceries: a selection of work by writers ranging
  from the likes of the late Artie Gold, and Robert Kroetsch, to the living
  Derek Beaulieu, Rachel Zolf, Colin Browne, Nicole Markotic, Eric Folsom,
  Natalie Simpson, etc., all collected here as representative of a decades
  aesthetic count.
                        from Gil McElroy's Introduction: An Integral

The Ottawa launch of Ground Rules is scheduled for Saturday, December 7th
2013 at The Manx Pub and is sponsored by the Ottawa International Writers
Festival. Lovingly hosted by rob mclennan, the event will feature readings
by three of the books contributors (to be announced over the next couple
of days). Watch for details via the Chaudiere Books blog, as well as our
Facebook page!

lovingly,

Christine McNair and rob mclennan
publishers

Dear all,

I hope you'll join us at the Zinc bar this Saturday 10/26 at 4:30 for
readings by

KEVIN MCPHERSON ECKHOFF + JAKE KENNEDY

Bestfriends! kevin mcpherson eckhoff and Jake Kennedy pretend as poets
around the Okanagan Valley with books and their weather. They're never too
worried. Google decides favourable to them. "Prove it for yourself, even!"
says BookThug! Have you or any of your aliases ever judged the temperature
of a snare and an invisible before? Put 'em together and invent your own
prize. Finally, according to Urban Dictionary, the =93Jake=94 verb means =
=93to
call the cops on a party that you were kicked out of,=94 as in, =93dude the=
se
guys are assholes, let=92s Jake!=94 Also, the same source identifies a =93K=
evin=94
as synonymous with hip-thrusting and abruptly signing off web chats or
electronic mails. Like, how would you describe like? An artificial chasm is
only the possibility. Now, it's time (every hour!) for a tepid serving of
g'morning poetry, so... goodbye!

Season curated by Genji Amino and Daisy Atterbury.

	 and, as Ezra Pounds eyebrows crept ever closer,
	the outlaw reunion came to an abrupt end, the

	I-vow-my-Troth recurring dream

	belly-dancing out of the room,
	much to the dismay of

	poets in their

	eating enchiladas, face up on the sofa like

	lights out in the bungalow means
	is another possible brush with self-realization.

	As the work goes on
	a few perfect notes taking form within

	the unshaven limits of formality,
	an eternally Al Neil squeals across

	the real room, the room itself
	takes on the form of

	a glassworks, a conversation.
	May I have a word with you?

	Poetry: the equivalence that licks
